            "content": "Kyoto Animation has been something of a lost soul, struggling to find its identity in a post-Haruhi and K-ON world. It is through flipping back the dial and returning to their roots that their newest title, Maid Dragon, is able to find its footing. It feels like something that might have been animated once upon a time in 2005, and that is precisely what makes it so special in the modern climate of harem and superpower.\r\nAnd unlike many of their more recent titles, it knows what it wishes to be and never compromises its vision in a futile attempt to appease everyone and anyone. Itdoesn't play around with drama, and it never centres on action and explosions despite its cast of malevolent dragons. It's silly. It's relaxing. And it can even be a bit heartwarming when it tries, too. Have I also mentioned that Tohru is cute as all hell?\\n\\n\r\nSome may immediately wince and groan upon reading the series' synopsis. Maids plus dragons does not make for a very promising setting, nor does it seem like a combination that required much more than two or three seconds of thought. Everything that could possibly exist has, or inevitably will, receive some sort of series with cute girls indiscriminately slapped onto it. Modern anime has trained people to be cynical.\\n\\n\r\nBut to treat Maid Dragon as just another silly comedy with moe characters wouldn't be entirely fair, as there are a number of things it does quite differently. Kobayashi, the show's title character and languid protagonist, is a working adult rather than the conventional teenager. Whereas most anime of its nature would choose instead to play a teenager as some pseudo-adult (\"my parents are conveniently away on a business trip, so, hey, I have this house and this maid lady all to myself\"), Maid Dragon chooses instead to portray real adults with real issues. Kobayashi is so bored with the office-lady routine that she will choose to drink herself halfway to death after a long day's work. Such is life in much of Japan.\\n\\n\r\nBy portraying adult characters, the sense of family between Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kamui feels genuine. Kobayashi is the mother of the household, and she will snap back at her dragon friends whenever they do something unreasonable. She is strict, yet also caring, and tries her best to understand their difficulties with getting used to the human world. Even little things such as peeling oranges for the two on their kotatsu makes it clear that she appreciates their company, even if she may not always be clear and forthright about it. Maid Dragon is true slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi being female also helps to keep the show away from any unnecessary sexual undertones. If she were male, the show would no doubt be a harem, and it would be all the worse for it. It is hard to care about a cast when the only thing characterising them is accidental breast fondling (yay) and walking in on (and screaming at) each other in the bathroom. Yawn. While Tohru's feelings for Kobayashi are humorously exaggerated as being romantic, that is not Tohru's actual intentions, and indeed, her reactions come more from gratitude and a desire to protect her guardian, rather than anything genuinely romantic or sexual. The one exception is that, yes, there is a compulsory beach scene, although I suppose I can't fault it too much as it was relatively short and harmless (and because Tohru's body is a lovely sight indeed).\\n\\n\r\nMaid Dragon can occasionally be funny-- Tohru visiting Kobayashi's workplace and repeatedly tripping her crabby boss, or challenging one of the other dragons to a fight in another dimension only to close it on them-- but it isn't an anime that is particularly defined by laughs. It is meant more to be relaxing, and, undoubtedly thanks to Kamui's presence, cute, at times adorable. I just wish it didn't have to repeat the same joke about Tohru cooking her tail a million and one times over. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is at its strongest when it focuses on these main three, which makes the scenes with the other three dragons and Kobayashi's otaku friend, Takiya, significantly less appealing. Takiya's split personality is so jarring and exaggerated that he is often more obnoxious than anything, and Quetzalcoatl is pretty much a non-character whose only defining traits are that her boobs are large and that she likes to dress in scantily-clad clothing. If they were taken out altogether, I don't think anyone would find much reason to complain. More time should instead have been spent developing Kobayashi's cynical worldview, and Tohru's newfound interest in human society, the show's two most compelling themes. It would be nice for Kamui to also have something else to her besides simply being cute and snugly, but then I suppose it would be difficult to develop a character who is essentially the equivalent of a six or seven-year-old child. I sure as heck did not have anything else defining me at that age besides a love for candy and temper tantrums. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation's artwork is generally excellent, but it certainly stands out in Maid Dragon's case. While there are few scenes that draw particular attention for their animation, the cute and humorous expressions the characters make (notably Tohru and Kamui) make the anime a ripe for grabbin' screenshots. Tohru's eyes are especially detailed, and draw attention to her nature as a dragon while never seeming overtly inhuman. Bright colours and soft edges also do well to enhance the fluffy, relaxing atmosphere the anime strives for. Part of the problem I had with some of KyoAni's other titles, such as Hibike Euphonium, is that they just looked so bland and dreary all the time. It's always welcome to see them return to a more traditional style, as traditional, it seems, is the very thing that KyoAni is skilled at. \\n\\n\r\nTo label Maid Dragon as something stellar or ground-breaking may be giving it a bit too much credit, but there is little doubt that it is at least a return to form for a studio that has been losing its way for many a year. It is as well a fun time in its own right, an almost nostalgic recollection of what slice-of-life anime used to be, and could, can be once more.",

In order to repay her kindness. She becomes her maid, and with that, the Unending story between these 2 begin. I wonder how it'll turn out...\r\nCharacter (10)\r\nWhat can I say? All these characters (D)ominate my heart. The way Tooru would just cook her (D)elicious tail. But Kobayashi refuses becuz she thinkit's (D)isgusting. Total D's=3. I can assume that Tooru is a triple D cup. Tooru is the main dragon of the series with her big smile, big heart, big attitude, and big..oh so big breasts. I'm sure you are guaranteed one chuckle or laugh each episode. I love how much Tooru clings to Yashi (I'm saying Yashi cuz Kobayashi is too much to type on mobile) it's a cute way of showing gratitude...I guess. The relationship between Tooru and Yashi will probably increase as the show goes on. I thought these 2 would be the main focus of the entire anime...\\n\r\nUNTIL THIS CUTE AS FUCK LOLI DRAGON COMES INTO PLAY!\\n\r\nKanna, this girl must be my spirit animal. She is a loli done right. A loli who is not annoying as fuk and can still make u smile for 3/4ths of an episode. Her character design is great and her VA, give that woman a FUKKING raise :3.\\n\r\nQuet..Kwetzu...Quetzalcoatl...I'll just call her Q-Cup (which apparently she is..Q..cup) This character along with Fafnir has only been introduced lately and are still waiting for more character development from these 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni...cmon now.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni...cmon now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nIt's Kyo..k I'll stop\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the animes for winter 2017. This anime takes my full enjoyment. How can a slice of slice series like this, have more action than some action animes that I know? This is the only anime I know that they make badass things. Such as:\\n\r\n\"Playing\"\\n\r\n\"Dodgeball\"\\n\r\n\"And playing Dark Souls\"\\n\\n\r\nHow will u even compare? This series takes the cake regarding full enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nI guess because it's a SOL, there isn't too much to dive on except the fact that it hurts to wait 1 week for 24 minutes of god sauce. The characters are fun, the overall plot and premise proves to be interesting, and the animation...mmmm...tasty. I can't wait to see more of these characters and their crazy shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nHowever I do have somewhat a concern for Tooru's past. Even Kanna's\\n\\n\r\nI just..idk...feel like something happened in the past. Like something not very good. Just a feeling though.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is the shortest review I've made thus far. I guess it's obvious considering this is a slice of life and a series to just sit back and relax with. I totally recommend this to anyone who wants something fun and exciting. Becuz it'll put a smile on your face...\\n\\n\r\nSince it sure has put one on mine...",

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid~\r\nIn the Japanese culture there are two really heartwarming greetings that represent the core of the family bonds: 'Tadaima' (\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e) and 'Okaeri' (\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a), respectively meaning 'I'm home' and 'welcome home'. The exchange between these greetings happen when one person arrives home, and there is another one to welcome them back. While not strictly restricted to family members alone, and can be used colloquially between friends and acquaintances, even in workplace and school, these greetings carry a deep and strong meaning behind them, which is no other that 'this is the place I belong to'.\r\nAlthough there are manyfactors that determine the place we could call 'home', and some of them may, naturally, not include a physical person, in my personal opinion just because there is someone eagerly waiting for your return, and acknowledges that is only natural for you to come back, because this is your place, is nothing less what I would call 'the feeling of getting home'.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to chose which family born in, the choice of what to call our 'home' is entirely up to us, and that includes, the circle of people that will come to form part of it. Claiming that 'there are many types of families as there are stars in the sky' might be quite a silly over exaggeration, however it is not entirely wrong to say there are countless combinations and bonds that shape, what we would later call, 'our family'.\\n\\n\r\nMoving one step back to the things impossible to chose, and the next one in the list is: Falling in Love. However this might be a completely biased opinion since I am a total, silly, romanticist, but there is a thing I believe we all have to agree: It is a completely unexpected chapter in our lives. After all, while all the other emotions arrives from the front door, this little bastard show itself from the back door while you were standing there like a dumb trying to see if Happiness was also in the group. Falling in love with someone takes you completely by surprise, and so as well, in some cases, is the person fated to mess around your entire existence.\\n\\n\r\n                  Falling in Love + Different race + same gender = Love problems?\\n\\n\r\nIn this particular case, to scramble our protagonist life, is a certain dragon's unconditional Love. Blind as it is, but really really that blind that gender, age, and even race, represent nothing but just tiny details, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid features a mighty powerful dragon who falls in love with a female human, and although remaining an important lead, the show's gimmick does not spin entirely around it, to the extent that it would not fall under the Romance category, the show has way more to offer than a simple fairytale love story.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the story follows super mighty dragon Tooru, and her time in the human world after becoming Kobayashi's maid, the person she's completely infatuated in. Kobayashi is a young office lady leading an existence of the prototypical Japanese salaryman. Work until late hours, almost nonexistent private life, (sometimes forced) drinking parties with the boss, and obviously getting home so tired that just opening the home's door is the last action before collapsing to the floor, everyday repeat, repeat and repeat. And so the gray and monotonous everyday life of office lady Kobayashi starts to gain, definitely, more color.\\n\\n\r\nMeet the Kobayashi's household - Residents: 1 human + 2 dragons + \u2665 = Family\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life series as it is, the anime narrates the everyday life of Tooru, self-proclaimed 'Dragon maid', the somewhat stoic office lady, Kobayashi, and little dragon, Kanna. What I really liked the most about this show is how the three of them, with the progression of the story, started to develop the bonds of a real adoptive family, satisfying the affective desires of each other, and caring deeply for the wellbeing of the members. These developments can be seen throughout the great writing of the dialogues between the characters, I specially adored the interactions between Tooru and Kobayashi, as they were the ones that contained the themes which I expressed in the very beginning of this review, 'the place I belong to'.\\n\\n\r\nTooru's inner turmoil regarding the human world, and her love for Kobayashi, which contradicts the apparently hate and fear for the humanity, are a constant recurring theme for the entire anime's progression. The series explores other themes such as the diversity and integration, something entirely affecting the dragons living in the human world, and their feelings regarding it's inhabitant, because living among them does not necessarily means living with them.\\n\\n\r\n             Unknown world + Unknown people + Being different = Trust problems\\n\\n\r\nGoing back a bit to the part when I mentioned that all the family members satisfy the affective desires, we can perfectly observe how the relationship wheel spin, and how much these interactions affected the lives of our three main characters. Kobayashi is a really stoic, passive person, and the difficulties she has maintaining a relationship with the other characters are plenty visible to see, specially towards the affection that comes from Tooru, as she has never been close to anyone before, she does not know how to behave. The exchange is bidirectional towards the dragon maid's inner chaos due to the new life and her love for the female human, that allows her to soon discovering that even though she sees humans as inferiors, she does have indeed desire to understand them. And finally little Kanna, the dragon which embraces the new environment with curiosity and willingness to integrate.\\n\\n\r\nBeing realised by Kyoto Animation, we can aspect some really cute designs, fluid quality animation, and bright colors, as per the studio's standard procedure. Also the Original Soundtrack was very great too, they accompanied the events perfectly, I could not ask for better.\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion this is a great Slice of Life, although moving perfectly according to the standard of the genre, bringing nothing original nor unique to the industry, it succeeds wonderfully in developing the main themes the show reached out to us, transmitting the message and the values, that were set as a primary goal for the accomplishment of what I consider, Quality.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful characters + excellent development + Great rhythms = Must watch\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol - Traducci\u00f3n con la ayuda de mi querido amigo OnionSoda]\\n\\n\r\nEn la cultura japonesa existen dos saludos de verdad reconfortantes los cuales representan el n\u00facleo de los lazos familiares: 'Tadaima' (\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e) y 'Okaeri' (\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a), que significan respectivamente 'Estoy en casa' y 'Bienvenido a casa'. El intercambio entre estos saludos se verifica cuando una persona reci\u00e9n llega a casa, y a su vez, es recibido por la otra persona que se encuentra ya en ella. Si bien no es restrictivo al uso familiar, y puede ser utilizado entre amigos y conocidos, incluso en el lugar de trabajo y escuela, estos saludos cargan el peso de un fuerte significado con ellos, el me gustar\u00eda describir como no m\u00e1s que 'el lugar a donde pertenezco'.\\n\\n\r\nSi bien hayan mucho factores que determinan el lugar que llamar\u00edamos 'hogar', y naturalmente, algunos pueden que no incluyan una persona f\u00edsica, en mi opini\u00f3n personal s\u00f3lo por el hecho que haya alguien que espere ansiosamente por tu regreso, y reconozca que es normal para ti el hecho de retornar, porque este es tu lugar, es algo que nada m\u00e1s ni nada menos llamar\u00eda 'el genuino regreso al hogar'.\\n\\n\r\nA\u00fan siendo imposible la decisi\u00f3n de escoger en que familia nacer, la elecci\u00f3n de lo que decidimos llamar nuestro 'hogar' es enteramente al alcance de todos, y con ellos incluye, el c\u00edrculo de personas que se vendr\u00edan a formar alrededor. Exclamar una frase como 'existen tipos de familia cuanto estrellas en el cielo' llegar\u00eda a ser una tonta exageraci\u00f3n, de todos modos no estar\u00edamos en el error al decir que son incontables las combinaciones y lazos que vendr\u00edan a formar, lo que llamar\u00edamos luego, 'nuestra familia'.\\n\\n\r\nHaciendo un paso atr\u00e1s, a cuando habl\u00e1bamos de las elecciones imposibles, la pr\u00f3xima en la lista ser\u00eda: Enamorarse. De todos modos, esto podr\u00eda ser una opini\u00f3n parcial ya que soy un completo, tonto, rom\u00e1ntico, a\u00fan as\u00ed hay algo en que creo que todos tenemos que acordar: Es un cap\u00edtulo totalmente inesperado en nuestras vidas. Despu\u00e9s de todo, cuando todas las otras emociones pasan por la puerta principal, este peque\u00f1o bastardo se presenta por la puerta posterior mientras t\u00fa estabas ah\u00ed parado como un bobo tratando de ver si Felicidad estaba tambi\u00e9n en el grupo. Enamorarse de alguien te toma completamente por sorpresa, y lo es inclusive, en algunos casos, la persona destinada a revolver tu total existencia.\\n\\n\r\nEnamorarse + diferente raza + mismo g\u00e9nero = Problemas de Amor?\\n\\n\r\nEn este caso particular, a desbaratar la vida de nuestra protagonista, es el Amor incondicional de un cierto drag\u00f3n. Ciego como es, pero realmente ciego que el g\u00e9nero, la edad, e inclusive la raza, representan nada m\u00e1s que peque\u00f1os detalles, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid se enfoca en un potente y temible drag\u00f3n que se enamora de una chica humana, y si bien qued\u00e1ndose como un importante desenvuelve, la esencia del anime no gira completamente entorno a ello, al punto que no caer\u00eda en la categor\u00eda Romance, este show tiene m\u00e1s por ofrecer que una simple amor\u00edo de un cuento de hadas.\\n\\n\r\nComo mencionado anteriormente, la historia sigue al potente drag\u00f3n Tooru, y su estad\u00eda despu\u00e9s de ofrecer, forzadamente, sus servicios como maid a Kobayashi, la chica por la cual perdi\u00f3 la cabeza. Kobayashi es una joven trabajadora cuya existencia sigue los pasos del t\u00edpico 'salaryman' japon\u00e9s. Se trabaja hasta tarde, casi inexistente vida social, (a veces obligadas) salidas a beber con los jefes, y obviamente el llegar a casa tan destruido que, la \u00faltima acci\u00f3n antes de desplomarse al suelo, es abrir la puerta de casa. El continuo repetirse de los d\u00edas, una y otra vez. Es as\u00ed que con la llegada de los nuevos hu\u00e9spedes, el gris y mon\u00f3tono d\u00eda a d\u00eda de Kobayashi comienza a ganar, seguramente, m\u00e1s color.\\n\\n\r\nConozcan la residencia de los Kobayashi  - ocupantes: 1 humano + 2 dragones + \u2665 = Familia.\\n\\n\r\nSiendo una Slice of Life como lo es, el anime narra el d\u00eda a d\u00eda de Tooru, autoproclamada 'Dragon Maid', la ap\u00e1tica joven trabajadora, Kobayashi, y la peque\u00f1a drag\u00f3n, Kanna. Lo que realmente me encanto de esta serie es como las tres, con el desarrollo de la historia, comienzan a establecer los lazos de una verdadera familia adoptiva, que satisfacen las necesidades afectivas de cada uno, preocup\u00e1ndose mutuamente por el bienestar de los miembros. Esta progresi\u00f3n es llevada a cabo gracias a la buena escritura de lo di\u00e1logos entre los personajes, especialmente adore las interacciones entre Tooru y Kobayashi, ya que fueron los que conten\u00edan los temas con los cuales, anteriormente, decid\u00ed abrir esta rese\u00f1a, 'el lugar a donde pertenezco'.\\n\\n\r\nLa confusi\u00f3n interior de Tooru acerca el mundo humano, y sus sentimientos por Kobayashi, los cuales contradicen su aparente odio y miedo por la humanidad, son temas recurrentes por el entero arco narrativo de la serie. La serie explora temas como la diversidad y la integraci\u00f3n, cosas que afectan principalmente los dragones que viven en el mundo humano, y sus sentimientos acerca sus habitantes, porque vivir entre ellos, no necesariamente quiere decir vivir con ellos.\\n\\n\r\nRegresando un poco a la parte donde menciono que todos los miembros de la familia satisfacen sus necesidades afectivas, podemos observar como la rueda de las relaciones gira al rededor de la nueva presencia en sus vidas. Kobayashi es una chica de verdad estoica, y las dificultades que tiene al mantener las relaciones con los otros personajes son f\u00e1ciles de individuar, especialmente cuando se trata del afecto que le proporciona Tooru, siendo el caso de nunca haber sido tan cercana a alguien antes, no sabe c\u00f3mo comportarse. El cambio es bidireccional hacia el caos interior que tiene la dragon maid debido a la nueva vida que enfrenta y a los sentimientos que tiene por la chica humana, el cual le permite descubrir que a\u00fan reputando los humanos como inferiores, tiene de verdad deseo de entenderlos. Y por \u00faltimo esta Kanna, la \u00fanica que acepta el nuevo ambiente con curiosidad y empe\u00f1o a integrarse. Aun teniendo una mentalidad similar a la de Tooru, al ser un infante ella logra ver un mundo bajo una diferente luz, un lugar lleno de cosas que esperan a ser descubiertas.\\n\\n\r\nLa serie fue realizada por Kyoto Animation, por lo que podemos esperar dise\u00f1os bonitos, calidad de animaci\u00f3n fluida, y colores brillantes, como suele proceder el estudio normalmente. Tambi\u00e9n el audio fue bastante bueno, se acompa\u00f1a a la perfecci\u00f3n a las escenas y eventos, no podr\u00eda pedir algo mejor.\\n\\n\r\nEn mi opini\u00f3n personal esta es una gran serie SoL, si bien movi\u00e9ndose perfectamente de acuerdo al patr\u00f3n del g\u00e9nero, trayendo nada de nuevo o revelador a la industria, logra desarrollar, magn\u00edficamente, los temas que se propone, trasmitiendo el mensaje y los valores que fueron puestos como objetivo primario para el resultado de lo que reputo, Calidad.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes geniales + Excelente desarrollo + Muy buen ritmo = No hay que perd\u00e9rselo",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid- Making Anime Fun Again\r\nRemember when anime was pure, unadulterated fun? Racing home as if on a quest to save a dying loved one, plopping your giddy ass on the sofa and turning on your favorite after-school cartoon? Nowadays, myself included, people get ignorantly pretentious and critical when it comes to anime\u2026 most likely due to the accessibility of other\u2019s opinions on the internet (you\u2019re guilty MAL!). But what happened to the days when you could share a bond with another over some good, old fashioned Chinese cartoons? God forbid you meet some dragon t-shirted, fedora wearing pleb that only cares formainstream shounen... whilst peddling Magic Cards out of his mom's basement. Sometimes even I fall into an over-analytical stupor and forget what makes anime so damn entrancing and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe undeniably successful Studio KyoAni\u2019s 2017 release of Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is a breath of fresh air in a barrage of unoriginality and criticality. It\u2019s endearing, cute, charming and hilarious, and most of all is that it doesn\u2019t rely on \u201c2deep4u\u201d plot lines or edgy characters to become a hit. It\u2019s an anime that breathes nostalgia for me, crafting a diverse, likable cast that has one character for everyone to enjoy and although ramps down, never gets stale. Of course Kobayashi isn\u2019t perfect, but moreso perfectly imperfect. Accompanied by an outstanding script and stunning, extravagant visuals, KyoAni smashes the target of a true feel-good anime, leaving self-proclaimed pundits with little ground left to criticize.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to story, sometimes simple is best. Nothing in Dragon Maid seems contrived, but moreso plays out like a situational comedy. The story is straightforward:\\n\\n\r\n-A shut-in girl (Kobayashi) gets drunk and accidentally makes a deal with a dragon concealing herself under the masquerade of graciously endowed maid. (Tohru)\\n\\n\r\n-Tohru and Kobayashi take in an adorable loli dragon, Kanna.\\n\\n\r\n-The three of them (and some of Tohru\u2019s mythical adversaries) live out the seasons in an episodic, heartwarming anime that\u2019ll be sure to make you smile.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Dragon Maid is the pillar of the entire anime. As previously mentioned, the simple structure of everything helps add to the endearing, carefree atmosphere that the show contains. Whether it\u2019s a scene about cooking or a candid beach/Christmas episode, the script is constructed in the most efficient manner possible. There is an array of characters from Tohru\u2019s mysterious homeland deriving from mythology. There\u2019s Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of learning and self-reflection, as well as the Norse referenced Fafnir, who was cursed and turned into a dragon. Seeing these fictional personalities personified and placed into ordinary scenarios like playing video games\u2026 most specifically the scene where Fafnir was playing the Dark Souls-esque dungeon crawler. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is often slapstick or quick-witted, emphasizing the quirky nature of Tohru and her friends. Jokes are subtly slipped into scenes without being corny or abundant, and there more than a few historical and pop culture references thrown in to liven things up as well. It reminds me of a less overblown version of Nichijou (thank you KyoAni!). Above all other aspects of the writing, Dragon Maid has a unique tendency to make me feel just, comfortable. Whether it was the family bond that Kobayashi, Tohru and Kanna emulated or the cozy scenes where they just wanted to sit around and watch tv, I truly felt at home with these \u201cpeculiar\u201d characters. I certainly didn\u2019t expect such a simple show to hit my nostalgia buttons.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any show, there were some aspects I didn\u2019t care for, or that could\u2019ve been done better. There was a lingering yuri theme present between Kobayashi and Tohru that acrobatically teetered between friendship and something more. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the only one that noticed this, but I can\u2019t say it was entirely necessary. Echoing this opinion was the relationship between Quetzalcoatl and her \u201cmaster\u201d. Fanservice is one thing, but her intrusive nature and suggestive sexuality was starkly convergent to the atmosphere present in the rest of the show. Lastly, the charm of Dragon Maid can tend to wear off over the length of the show, so I\u2019d recommend watching the anime in stages to prevent this.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi is a 9-5\u2019er; a twenty-something introvert who takes out her aggressions from her job over a beer or twelve at night. She\u2019s what most of us in that age bracket don\u2019t care to admit that we are. Tohru is a self-proclaimed servant, attempting to erase her past and start a more peaceful life on Earth. Tohru and Kobayashi both developed significantly throughout the series, and played off each other very well. Most importantly is that the writers did this without making it the focus of the anime. Kanna is truly the cutest thing in existence, and everyone knows it\u2026 and Fafnir\u2019s deep hatred for the human race slowly dissolved the more time he spent around them. The slow addition of side characters, and their mythological influence was reminiscent of The Devil is a Part Timer, only done significantly better.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni nailed it again when it came to animation. Colors are vibrant and lively, with Tohru\u2019s eyes set ablaze with a mix of red and orange hues. Although not \u201ctechnically\u201d superior to shows like Hyouka, Dragon Maid\u2019s art style takes on a life of its own. The character models are all so original and inviting, and the action scenes were a joy to watch. More similarities were present with Nichijou, especially Kobayashi\u2019s \u201cdead fish\u201d eyes, and the sporadic expressions on various character\u2019s faces. Beautiful work for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of the most jolly, alluring OPs I\u2019ve ever come across, both due to the upbeat music and flawless animation. It tells its own story, one of innocent fun and excitement. I definitely put it on my phone already :P The ED is just as good, and acts as the punctuation at the end of each episode. I don\u2019t always listen to the ED all the way through, but I made an exception for this anime. I also enjoyed hearing the variety of tracks in the OST\u2026 with its overall cheeky tones and beats. The voice acting is superb, especially considering most of the cast is relatively unknown. Some of the better performances coming from Kobayashi and Tohru themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of this anime. The simplicity, coupled with the characters and overall coziness make a show I won't soon forget. I prefaced my review with a paragraph discounting criticality for a reason. Go into Dragon Maid to relax and have fun, nothing else. It's not intellectually stimulating, there's no abstract symbolism and there's no unnecessary ecchi moments. Enjoy it for what it is. I'd recommend this to fans of other heartwarming shows like Barakamon or Usagi drop, or fellow KyoAni-ites. They really surprised a lot of people with this show, and I'm certainly happy that I watched it. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "\"Ravioli, ravioli, don't lewd the dragon loli.\" Easier said than done when the anime is basically doing it for you already.\r\nI must admit that I have been rather critical of Kyoto Animation in the last few years. Such a talented studio who used to work wonders back in the day with titles such as Clannad, Haruhi, Lucky Star and K-On, but over the course of the last four years or so I have been rather disappointed with their series, with shows such as Kyoukai no Kanata and Musaigen no Phantom World really failing to live up to their previous standards. But Kobayashi-san Chi no MaidDragon actually feels like KyoAni finally returning to their roots, and for the first time in several years, it made me remember why I used to love this studio so much back in the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts with the typical adult office worker Kobayashi suddenly receiving a surprise visit one day... from a dragon. A dragon who then transforms into a human girl in a maid outfit and proclaims that she wants to live with her and work for her as her personal maid. As it turns out, Kobayashi had actually proposed the idea herself during some drunken escapade in the mountains earlier, and thus awkwardly finds herself having to invite the girl in. And thus begins Kobayashi's hectic everyday life of cohabitating with a dragon maid: Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a very simple series at heart but it works. It's reminiscent of KyoAni's wacky moe comedies of the past, and most of its success stems from the overblown characters and the stellar production value. Tooru is one big bundle of endless energy, in stark contrast to Kobayashi's deadpan and cool-headed personality. She is largely unfamiliar with how human society works as she came here through a portal from a different world, and as a result she sometimes suggests some ludicrous things such as haphazardly slaughtering people, and it is up to Kobayashi to keep her in check. Tooru is also rather openly affectionate with Kobayashi and repeatedly claims that she loves her, though Kobayashi mostly seems to see it as a child looking for parental affection rather than anything romantic for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIf the entire series had solely revolved around Kobayashi and Tooru though, it would likely have become stale and repetitive before long, but fortunately that is not the case. There are numerous other characters, most of them other dragons, who are introduced one at a time as the anime progresses. The first of these, and also the only other one who would have to be considered as one of the show's main characters, is Kanna Kamui: proud owner of the sexiest piece of loli ass in a very long time (not to mention her thicc thighs). In all seriousness though, everything about her just screams moe, and in my mind she is the real star of this anime. Her looks, her personality and behaviour, even her husky and emotionless voice; all of it is unbearably cute. I think she is right up there with the likes of Kafuu Chino and Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko as far as pure moe overdose levels go. Kanna's role in the story is as a young dragon who follows Tooru to the human world and eventually ends up living with Kobayashi as well. She acts like the child of the strange household and also starts attending a local elementary school due to wanting to experience everyday life in human society in a way befitting someone of her age. What her exact age actually is we are never informed of, but she is supposedly still over 600 years old in human years, so she is presumably of legal age enough to do whatever degenerate things you lolicons want to do to her. On top of being irresistibly adorable though, I think Kanna also brings out the best side of Kobayashi. As the story goes on, you can gradually see Kobayashi becoming more and more of a mother figure to Kanna with the way she treats her, through acts such as taking time off work in order to be able to visit Kanna's school's sports festival and trying to sneak in presents in her Christmas stocking just like how she believes Santa would do it. It brings a genuinely heartwarming touch to what is otherwise a relatively non-serious anime, but it all blends together really well.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the supporting cast there is also Kobayashi's fellow coworker and otaku Takiya, as well as three other dragons in the form of the reclusive and mysterious Fafnir, the diligent but na\u00efve Elma, and the easygoing and voluptuous Quetzalcoatl, more commonly known as Lucoa. Takiya and Fafnir have a sort of otaku bromance going on, which serves as a pretty nice contrast from the craziness going on whenever Tooru is around, and Elma functions well as the one dragon who can actually interact with Kobayashi on somewhat normal terms due to her personality and occupation. Lucoa however is the one character in this show which I honestly find rather useless. For one she is a typical fanservice character with gravity-defying breasts bigger than her head, but the way she utilizes them is kind of disturbing too. She does not move in with Kobayashi but rather lives in the house of a local child, and the way she interacts with him is basically through ignorant sexual harassment, which feels rather creepy to watch considering their milf and shota characteristics (the kid's name is literally Shouta I might add). Even outside that household though, the only thing Lucoa ever seems to do is jiggle her enormous knockers and nothing else. Her entire persona can be summarized by her tits. The show would really be better off without her.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is definitely not without its fair share of fanservice, however discounting Lucoa, the other stuff in that department that the anime has to offer is honestly more of a plus than a hindrance I think. Takiya and Fafnir may have a very close friendship past a certain point in the story, but it feels legitimately believable and honest rather than a pair of boys who just got shipped together for the hell of it or anything put into a sexual context. While I am sure the fujoshi crowd will have no problem overcoming that barrier, at least in the context of the show itself, their relationship only comes across as two people who became close friends due to a common interest of hobbies, in this case anime and video games. There are also numerous segments starring Kanna and her human school friend Riko, where it is made quite clear that the latter has a pretty huge infatuation with her dragon classmate. What exactly the nature of those feelings are is debatable considering Riko's young age, but either way there are many scenes of the two of them snuggling together and Riko being super excited about it as a result. It is kind of like a running gag throughout the show where Riko gets so excited over Kanna that she almost gets an ahegao as a result, which I guess is at least somewhat original instead of the more stereotypical nosebleed reaction. Kanna also does some rather surprising things to Riko in return sometimes such as spontaneously licking her on the cheek, but this feels more like an animalistic behavior caused by her non-human nature as she does not seem to mean it to be anything more than a friendly gesture, though of course Riko probably does not interpret it as such. Some people might find it a bit weird seeing two lolis being so physically affectionate with each other, but considering how clingy girls can be amongst friends combined with the facts that Kanna is a dragon and that Riko is highly exaggerated like most anime characters, it still feels believable to me. And also given how incredibly cute Kanna is as a character, it is not like I can blame Riko if she really does have some deeper feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production value, the anime is undeniably top notch. The fact that the art and animation is stellar should be a given since it is KyoAni we are talking about, and there is not a whole lot to say about it other than that it looks like KyoAni shows normally do: in other words fantastic. Since this is a throwback to their moe shows of old though, it is perhaps a bit more colorful than normal in order to fit the light-hearted nature of the show. The music department is also great: the OP and ED are both super catchy tunes and it also has some surprisingly good insert songs throughout the episodes themselves as well with a rather tranquil and artistic feel-good atmosphere to them, and the voice acting is all-round solid as well. There really is not much to complain about in these aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all though, what you have is a well-directed and thoroughly entertaining anime which--while simplistic in nature--is very much aware of its own limitations and unapologetically embraces its own strengths. It shifts quickly between being over-the-top absurdity and relaxing yet heartwarming slice of life shenanigans, but the transitions are smooth and natural, and it is just as enjoyable in both ways. Yes, there are some things that could have been done better, and no, it is not the single best moe comedy ever made, but it is quite well above average at the very least, and definitely something well worth your time checking out.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nDiverse and likeable characters\\n\r\nTop tier moe, especially Kanna\\n\r\nOftentimes quite heartwarming\\n\r\nSuperb production value\\n\r\nSimple, light-hearted fun like the KyoAni of old\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nAlthough entertaining, it is not exactly hilarious either\\n\r\nLucoa is useless",

The concept has been done before, but never has it been refined to what Kobayashi is offering.\r\nIt's a simple comedy, but  yet it knows what it wants to be. Kobayashi knows it is simple, but funny and it makes no jabs at trying to branch out in territories unbound to them just for more fanservice.(Well aside from quetzalcoatl...yeah.)\r\nThe characters are from mythology, and that is what gives them refinement. The infamous Fafnir to Quetzalcoatl. All of themhave some form of unique marking inside of history itself and that gives the characters their own depth. But seeming them humanized and trying to adjust to society whilst the funny quirks that follow in an everyday life of living with dragons is what makes this show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIt is simple, but it knows what it wants to be and therefore it makes no other attempts in trying to be something else. It is there for us to enjoy weekly, and nothing more should be said about it. The show isn't complex, but that isn't needed for you to enjoy yourself with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the characters and their design themselves are simple as well, but they offer nice depth as well. Each of them have a distinctive outfit which matches their personality and archetype despite just being...simple.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something to simply smile, and just overall have a pleasant time watching: rest assured, as the everyday life of following a human as they watch dragon's humanize and adjust to everything will surely help you have a pleasant time. Kobayashi is a very enjoyable show overall, and I highly recommend those looking for something this season to give it a whirl, especially if you like simple animes.",

            "content": "I don't like this show. \r\nMaybe it's because I rarely enjoy SoL moe, and this one annoyed me more than usual due to the ungodly amount of praise it's gotten. Either way, I don't see how this show can be anything more than average to most people.\r\nThe story...it's SoL. There is no story. Episodes are a string of cute situations with various characters. This is how the genre functions. But how are the characters?\r\nThey range from cookie-cutter to slightly okay. Kobayashi and Tohru are both overplayed tropes; Tohru being a \"Naive other-worldly creature discovering the world\" and Kobayashi being her \"Deadpan caretaker\". At least halfthe jokes in the show consist of Tohru doing something that only a dragon would do, followed by a stoic reaction image from Kobayashi. It's funny the first couple times, then it gets old. \\n\r\nNext is Kanna, who the internet seems to have collectively fallen in love with. She's sort of decent; deadpan lolis are usually funny, but she almost feels like a fanservice character to act as a daughter to the two main characters - and, not surprisingly, she becomes the victim of pedo humor. More on that with these two. \\n\r\nLucoa and Shouta aren't in the show much, but their purpose is clear enough; Provide fanservice with a large breasted adult woman who wants to feel up an elementary school boy. Tasteful. \\n\r\nThe only other characters I can think to mention are Fafnir and Takiya, who are only there to make jokes about being nerds. Another concept that's funny at first with its references and homages to popular games/anime, but again, it gets old. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are good. It's KyoAni, no surprises here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think this show has no merit at all, but it's carried along by tasteless fanservice and repetitive humor that always boils down to \"Dragon does something inappropriate in public\", \"Reference to anime/nerd culture\", or \"Look at these children in sexual situations\". \\n\\n\r\nI know this whole review sounds like it was written by an elitist who hates fun, but I just don't like this show, nor how much it's been forced in my face.",

I thought wrong.\r\n   Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon starts off cute enough, with an at least *slightly* original premise, and a fair number of visual jokes that made me audibly laugh. As the series continued, the laughs where still there, but in fewer and fewer numbers as more characters were being introduced.\r\n   My problem with this anime is it quickly became another season of \"Pick Your Trope Waifu.\" Like, yo,we got Basic, we got Jailbait, we got Honkers, we got Edgelord, and our most recent addition, Basic 2.0. Take your pick. \\n\\n\r\nMost of these (Very underdeveloped, as of eight episodes out of what will most likely be twelve,) characters have running jokes at this point. Jailbait is always eating, Honkers is always bouncing around and teasing a child, (Which, like, geez,) and Edgelord is just being a NEET. Basic is her name. Pretty boring. Haven't seen much of Basic 2.0 because she showed up last episode, (8) but she seems ok. Kobayashi is also kinda boring, but her presence in the show isn't annoying, unlike a lot of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe point I'm making is that there is nothing special or new about any of the characters, and few actions have been made to invoke character progression. \\n\r\nYou have to be shallow and like the characters for just appearance and personality, and I'm not willing to do that, I want either original jokes, (Not the same ones every week,) or a story. \\n\\n\r\n   Speaking of story, where is it? It didn't need one, I think K-On! and Squid Girl did just fine without stories, but Maid Dragon has tried to get its viewers hyped about Basic's homeland/past and haven't elaborated. Either add story or leave it, don't put it up for 1 min. every other episode and act like I'm suppose to be dying to know what happens.\\n\r\nThe show just shoves any means of a narrative in favor of more waifu trash.     \\n\\n\r\n   Intro's catchy, the rest of the music sucks. JPN VA is generic, English VA is hilarious. (In a bad way.)\\n\\n\r\n   It's the average, bad, popular anime of the batch. I waited eight episodes to quit because I wanted to let all of the characters be introduced. After seeing Basic 2.0, I'm convicted this show won't change, and won't be worth my time to finish.",

I know that comedy is a very subjective genre, so I can see why other people would like it, so in this review I will talk about what I liked and what I didn't from this anime, while trying to keep it as a recommendation to give ita try as long as you're fine with what this anime delivers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a woman called Kobayashi finds a dragon named Tohru, that looks for a home to live, and after insisting she becomes Kobayashi\u2019s maid, from there other dragons start to appear and they become a part of the daily life of our protagonist. With each introduction we get hints that there is more to know about the dragon world and the conflicts that happen there, something that sadly doesn't get explored in this anime, and while I find that fine since this is just a context for the story and it\u2019s still early on to really need development, I still feel a bit disappointed because the idea is interesting and I wanted to see more.\\n\\n\r\nMy issues with this series (and in the end what makes me like a comedy or not) is the characters and the comedy itself. While some characters were fine the way they were (Tohru and Fafnir in special were pretty nice and I enjoyed most of their comedy bits), there are some that very early on reached a point where I was annoyed with them, and the constant repetition of their gag (even 4 or 5 times in an episode at times) without them getting any development during the series to make me feel that there was more to them than that, reduced a lot my enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst in that list is the duo Kanna-Ahegao girl (she's called Riko, but she really deserves that nickname), Kanna is cute, I get it, everything she does is made to be an overdose of cuteness,  but all Ahegao girl did for the whole series was, yeah, doing an ahegao face when near Kanna because she was really cute like always, while some people find that face funny, I found it absolutely annoying right from the first time, and nothing about her character changed at any point to make the gag atleast funnier or different. One thing that really bothered me is how the series used Kanna for fanservice at times, and more considering how she has the attitude of a child. One scene with Ahegao girl in particular was very uncomfortable to watch and made me lose the hopes in ending up warming up to this anime sooner or later.\\n\\n\r\nBut if we're talking about uncomfortable, Lucoa definitely takes the cake here. I can resume her character in a single word: boobs, all of her comedy comes from them, either via having them bouncing, her wearing dresses that show them a lot (she even gets called as someone that \u201cdresses like a slut\u201d by Kobayashi, I'm dead serious), but definitely the worst part is her constant gag of breast smoothering a kid she lives with using them, I'm fine with some fanservice, but Maid Dragon reaches a point where I think that they went too far, both with how much it uses it, and to which characters the fanservices goes directed to.\\n\r\nFinally there is Kobayashi, our protagonist, that while I find her a pretty bland character, I think that this is exactly her purpose since she is there to bring the heartwarming moments of the series, related to her enjoying having all these weirdos around giving colour to the lifeless world around her due to her personality, I find that scenes well executed and I wish that the series revolved more around the family feel they create.\\n\\n\r\nIn the artistic part, well, it's KyoAni, really well animated moments in the scenes where the series needed them while staying nice from start to end. The series also provides a solid OST, with personal mention to the song that plays in the previously mentioned heartwarming scenes, that improved them a lot in my opinion, and the opening \u201cAozora no Rhapsody\u201d that is a very catchy song to start the episode in a nice mood.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, while I personally didn't enjoy this anime due to not being a fan of the comedy and the fanservice present in the series, it's definitely worth trying out if what I mentioned didn't bother you.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon was released in early 2017 and is a breath of fresh air in the modern climate of sexually-charged harem anime. Maid Dragon is a completely wholesome slice of life series with no sexual content or fanservice. Forget whatever you've seen online about it -- this is the kind of anime you can watch with your parents.\r\nThe series starts with a dragon, Tooru, who wants to work for the main character, Kobayashi, as a maid. Kobayashi was wholesomely blackout drunk when she first met Tooru and barely remembers the encounter, but apparently she offered Tooru a place tostay, provided that Tooru worked as a maid. You might expect such a premise to lend itself to sexually charged fanservice in order to pander to an audience of horny teenagers, but Maid Dragon avoids such baseness. You see, Kobayashi is a female -- an adult, even! So there can't be any fanservice, because lesbians are not a popular category of porn for straight male audiences.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering how a dragon can be a maid. As it turns out, Tooru (and all the supernatural characters on the show) can disguise themselves as humans. In her human form, Tooru has large breasts that have a tendency to bounce, complete with sound effects. There's nothing sexual or fanservicey about that, and besides, it doesn't happen often. Only multiple times per episode. Another dragon, Quetzalcoatl (commonly called Lucoa) has even larger breasts, which tend to bounce even more. As such, Lucoa can properly be called a well-rounded character. The size of both dragon's breasts are the subject of envy by Kobayashi, and she comments on them throughout the series. This isn't an attempt at fanservice because that's just how all women talk to each other. In the first episode, Kobayashi takes Tooru's clothes off while they're drinking in a bar. You might think, \"Okay, that has to be fanservice,\" but again, it's okay because they're both women, and women do not have any sexual agency.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read much about this series, you may have noticed discussions and internet memes tend to focus on the character Kanna. Kanna -- who is listed first on MAL's list of characters despite not being one of the two main characters -- is what is referred to in some circles as a \"dragon loli\" and you are instructed not to \"lewd\" her. A lot of online commentary refers to her \"thicc\" thighs. This is actually a typo: they meant to type \"wholesome thighs\" but the keys were right next to each other. Mistakes such as this are very common in the Maid Dragon fandom.\\n\\n\r\nSince Kanna has the body of a child and attends the third grade, it would be extremely inappropriate to give her large, bouncing breasts with sound effects. No self-respecting anime would sexualize a child... so you'll have to read the Maid Dragon manga if you want to see a kid with large breasts. In one of the first scenes with Kanna, it is explained that she and Tooru cleaned each other with their tongues, and the viewer is shown a picture of said cleaning. The picture appears to show both characters in their human forms, but it is blurred out, probably because it's too wholesome and not sexually suggestive at all. You'll have to refer to the manga for an uncensored version of that as well.\\n\\n\r\nAt school, Kanna makes friends with a third grader named Riko. Though she dislikes Kanna at first, Riko eventually says that she would marry Kanna. Whenever there is skin-to-skin contact between the two children, in innocent circumstances such as accidentally brushing together, or playing twister, or Kanna sitting on Riko's lap, or Kanna straddling Riko, etc. etc., Riko becomes visibly excited, usually making an ahegao face. For the dear readers who don't know the definition of ahegao, here is what Urban Dictionary has to say:\\n\\n\r\n\"Ahegao: The anime/manga version of an orgasmic facial expression. It's generally very sexualized and lewd, and may or may not be accompanied with heart eyes/pupils.\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause you mustn't \"lewd the dragon loli,\" the Urban Dictionary must be mistaken in saying that ahegao carries sexual connotations.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining child on the cast is Shouta, whose name is not at all similar to \"Shota.\" Shouta attempts to summon a demon, but instead, Quetzalcoaltl hears him and decides to go live with him. Quetzalcoatl is the aforementioned extremely busty Aztec goddess of fertility, and one of the show's most wholesome sources of humor comes from her frequently pushing Shouta's face into her breasts, disregarding his objections and embarrassment. This might sound like she is molesting Shouta, but how can she be? There is nothing sexual about fertility goddesses. Shouta's parents are never seen, but one can assume that they're happy that he lives with such a responsible guardian.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a family-friendly show that I would recommend to anyone. It contains NO fanservice, and you don't need to give yourself a long look in the mirror if you enjoyed it. I rate it 10/10. \\n\r\nThanks for reading my first review!",

It's hard to find enjoyment in life and inspiration to keep moving forward when you're working at 2 in the morning and subsisting exclusively on Redbull and frozen pizza. \r\nDuring one particularly hard night, I was browsing twitter and came across a picture of an adorable anime character with purple and white hair. \"That's it!\" I thought to myself. \"This is what I've been searching for!\" I scrambled to my work computer to find more, and as I scrolled through videos and images for the series Kobayashi-san Chi no Dragon Maid, arealization slowly dawned upon me.\\n\\n\r\nThis character was more than just a cute animated loli. In many subtle ways, it resembled the old Gods and spirits of Aztec mythology. The patterns in her dress... The long, flowing hair... the resemblance was uncanny. But there was something more to it than that... some nigh incomprehensible, yet wholly palpable spiritual essence that I have yet to wrap my head around.\\n\\n\r\nI had to find more. I watched all of the episodes available to me with feverish passion, examining every colorful animated second of it. My conclusion: I was 100% correct in my previous assertation. Kobayashi-san Chi no Dragon Maid represents more than just what's visible on it's fluffy, well-written comedic surface. Instead, it's the beginning of a cultural zeitgeist, the ushering-in of the new \"moe\" era.\\n\\n\r\nIn time, people will look back and point to this show as the turning point in or global shared culture. Even farther into the future, they'll find statues of Kanna and Toohru in the shattered remnants of our civilization and piece together their story-lines, much like we have done with the wreckage of the great Roman empire.\\n\\n\r\nI could be wrong, of course. Maybe this is just a light-hearted romp with inventive and cute characters, fantastic animation, and fun comedic scenarios (the moe/comedy genre is KyoAni's forte, after all). However, I don't think that's the case.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be watching the entire series, that much is certain. I'll also be purchasing the various merchandise that the series spawns. Figures, posters, DVD, etc... all the evidence that future generations will be using to learn more about this incredibly important time in human development that we inhabit.\\n\\n\r\nYou can think I'm crazy if you want. Maybe sleep deprivation, paired with malnutrition and 3-hour-long hentai viewing sessions have reduced my brain to a mashed-poatato-like mush, and these are the rambling of a man who has finally lost his grip  on reality.\\n\\n\r\nBut what if I'm right?\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: 10/10. This series is a must-watch for both hardcore followers of anime and casual viewers alike.",

            "content": "When I started watching this show, I was so so excited about it.  I haven't seen a lot of yuri so I wasn't familiar with a lot of the tropes it used. But, despite some sort of awkward ecchi moments, I enjoyed it a lot. I really like the way that Tohru, Kobayashi, and Kanna's characters were developed for the first four or five episodes, and the slice of life aspects of it really appealed to me.\r\nBut, episode 6 was the beginning of the end with episode 7 being the nail in the coffin. The abrupt turn from a feel good, slice of lifeyuri to a pedo fanservice free-for-all was shocking and gross. The main characters were dropped in favor of pedo plotlines for side characters that made me 5000% angry and uncomfortable. 2/3 of episode six involved either the weirdly sexual scenes between two elementary schoolers, or Lucoa, portrayed as an adult female, sexually harassing a young boy. \\n\\n\r\nIt really gave me this vibe of the producer's having a total lack of confidence in their vision. Like, maybe they thought that not enough people would enjoy a fantasy-style, slice of life yuri, but surely they would get an audience if they threw in some horribly off color fanservice. It was so unbelievably disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSo I thought, 'Well, maybe this was just a fluke. Maybe this was their fanservice episode and they just completely bombed it.' But no, then comes the teaser for episode 7, titled simply 'The Fanservice Episode'. Needless to say, I didn't watch it. \\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine gushed over episode 8 and said that it returned to the original plot lines that I so loved from the first four episodes. So, I skipped episode 7 and went straight to 8, and I did like those plotlines. Yet, they can't just leave it alone. Every change in scene includes a disgusting pedo fanservice clip of Lucoa and Shota. I can't even suspend my distaste to enjoy a Tohru/Kobayashi centered episode, and it's so SAD.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really could have been very good. If they had just stuck to what had fans watching in the first place, which was the great slice of life and the development of Tohru and Kobayashi, then I think they really could have had a hit on their hands. But, by bombarding the audience with this pedo BS that literally no one asked for, they tanked their own work. In one episode, this show went from a 9 to a 5 from me, and it just keeps dropping.",

He guided the studio producers into a months-long effort in crafting a sequel to the massively successful Sound! Euphonium. When the dust settled, KyoAni\u2019s staff, with the utmost confidence, released Sound! Euphonium 2, and then they celebrated. They engaged in several rounds of poker, and they consumed multiple tabs of LSD (One employee in particular swallowed six tabs at once), as well as a large helping of cocaine. 4 hours passedbefore Mr. Hatta summoned his employees into the meeting room. He stated, \u201cI know that we already took care of the Fall season with Sound! Euphonium 2 but we need something to air in the winter. Any ideas, guys?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe KyoAni employees, still buzzed from the booze, drugs, and other late-night adventures, quietly remained in a state of half-consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nMr. Hatta, visibly exasperated, muttered hopelessly, \u201cJust blurt out the first thing that pops in your head.\u201d It was Jiro Tazaki, a fresh-faced intern on his first day, that spoke up. It remains a mystery if it was the LSD, the alcohol, or God Himself that planted the idea in Tazaki\u2019s mind but on that day, the concept he introduced would be the catalyst behind KyoAni\u2019s latest heavy-hitter project.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Mr. Hideaki Hatta spoke, what Jiro Tazaki responded with was, \u201cBouncing dragon tits.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n*******\\n\\n\r\nWith that, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon was born.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that could turn away potential viewers, it\u2019s the cutesy character designs. From the woefully oversized eyes to the roundness of the character\u2019s frames, and even the rose-tinted cheeks, the character designs are a victim of mo\u00e9 overdose. Then again, realism has always been a foreign concept for Kyoto Animation, so no surprise there.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon prides itself in its humor but early on, its comedy is a bit too dependent on unnecessary boob grabs for its own good. While that element is minimized yet never erased, the show leans more and more on its Fish out of Water jokes as the runtime progresses, and this is where the show strikes comedy gold. There are more than a few instances in which Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon constructs an exaggerated, fantastical contrast to real-world occurrences. When the characters are shopping for school supplies, a common stapler is interpreted as a torture device. When one character seeks to learn about sports festivals, events like running, ball-tossing, and tug o\u2019 war are processed as medieval tactics in battle. It\u2019s scenes like those that aid Tohru (Miss \u201cBouncing Dragon Tits\u201d herself), and her other fire-breathing friends in adjusting to a world not their own.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s right here that you\u2019d be tempted to think, \u201cSlice-of-life/comedy about characters from a different world living on our own? Hey, this is The Devil is a Part-Timer all over again!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon does have a similar premise with that of The Devil is a Part-Timer, that is the extent to which these two titles are identical. While The Devil is a Part-Timer has its characters lead normal lives in a day or two, it requires a month for this show to do the same. While The Devil is a Part-Timer allows its characters to showcase their abilities in broad daylight, there are consequences that occur when this show does the same. While The Devil is a Part-Timer maneuvers its supporting characters to the sidelines, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon allows its relatively minor characters (like the domineering Riko Saikawa, the perpetually anxious Shouta, or (my personal favorite) the brooding Fafnir) to claim their moments in the spotlight. While The Devil is a Part-Timer briefly mentions the characters\u2019 past lives and never bothers to provide details, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon reflects on the bygone days and consistently links that to the cast\u2019s arcs. In short, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon embarks on the same path as The Devil is a Part-Timer yet it contains a more enhanced storyline than the latter, as well as greater character depth.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the aforementioned character depth is what distinguishes this series from its peers, the method in which depth is handled as flawed at best. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon exists on the strained relationship between humans and dragons, as well as attempts to rectify this dynamic. However, the razor-sharp focus on this concept, though admirable, prevents this show from delving into potentially fantastic subplots. Sure, there are a few discussions about familial dynamics and self-exploration, but ultimately the show never truly ponders on these ideas. Though it appears quite underwhelming, the (very) limited range of thematic elements in Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon shouldn\u2019t automatically blacklist this title (After all, Onihei isn\u2019t exactly a paragon of versatility yet there are many, myself included, that consider it to be this season\u2019s hidden gem). However, I must advise you to be prepared for this show\u2019s \u201cserious scenes\u201d. Suffocating beneath the overwhelming weight of the warm, childlike atmosphere of the show, these segments provide a complete contrast to the rest of the series. At first, they carried grace, sophistication, and a unique charm (CGDCT + pathos wasn\u2019t a formula I encountered before) but later on, it felt as though these segments were recycling the same handful of storyline beats over and over. By the fifth episode, I was bored to tears, and apparently so was KyoAni\u2019s brain trust. They ensured that the serious scenes received a mercifully short runtime with each appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAmbition is a trait that I absolutely covet when it involves anime. There are few things I adore more than witnessing an anime series journey beyond the conventional. With this series, however, I am satisfied with its exercise in normalcy. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon doesn\u2019t desire to reinvent the wheel nor to \u201csave anime\u201d in the vein of Studio Trigger. No; what it seeks is to entertain, and on that front, it has more than succeeded. Whether it\u2019s the witty sexual innuendos, Tohru trolling Miss Kobayashi\u2019s short-tempered supervisor, or her utterly breathtaking chasedown of a purse snatcher, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon guarantees excitement. And that\u2019s just fine with this run-of-the-mill reviewer. For once, the hype is justified.\\n\\n\r\n6 dodgeball-playing dragons out of 10",

            "content": "Once every now and then, we get some strange premise that gets animated on television. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is one such title that is probably more appealing to be quoted than anything else at first. Literally translating to Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid, it\u2019s definitely a title that will raise some eyebrows. I mean really, a dragon as a maid? That\u2019s the probably one of the silliest ideas if you think about it on paper. It also shouldn\u2019t be surprising as it\u2019s one of Cool-kyou Shinga\u2019s works. The author is known for expressing a lot of freedom in ideas. As such, watching this showwith an open mind will definitely bring in a lot of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nWho would have thought that Kyoto Animation would be the studio to adapt this show? Unlike some of the author\u2019s other works (which turned out to be very short shows), this one runs for full length. Make no mistake about it though, the series is exactly what it sounds like. The first episode pretty much establishes the general concept as we meet Kobayashi, a young software programmer living her normal life in Tokyo. Life take a turn for her when she unknowingly saves a dragon named Tooru during one of her drunken scenarios. Fate follows and soon, Kobayashi has her own personal maid. Err, dragon maid. As you can judge from this premise, the show is portrayed more or less a slice of life fantasy. Despite being a dragon, Tooru isn\u2019t entirely violent although she does possesses a disdain for humans. The only human that she seems to care the most is Kobayashi. In fact, she even develops a girly crush on her to the point of being devotion. That\u2019s what really makes this show so entertaining because at its core, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon always seeks to have fun by expanding on its ideas into a colorful fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe series consists a diverse yet noticeable character cast. I\u2019ll be honest though, main female protagonist Kobayashi is probably the least interesting character. She is the epitome of normal in this show when compared to others. Face it, she looks plain with an average paying job and average personality. However, Tooru finds her very appealing because she is honest to others and herself. Speaking of Tooru, she stands out as the most interesting character in the show. Coming from an entirely different world, it\u2019s no surprise that she lacks common sense about Earth and its people. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s shown that she lacks knowledge about being a maid at all. She also has virtually no experience with technology, cooking, or job skills. However, Tooru adapts well or at least she tries. Kobayashi is her main motivation to improve and she even comes to like Earth as time passes on.\\n\\n\r\nOther noticeable characters in the show is a young dragon named Kanna. As one of the youngest characters in the show, she behaves exactly like a child. In the beginning, Kanna has a disdain for Kobayashi and wants Tooru to return with her to their world. However as time progresses, she is more accepting of Kobayashi and even starts treating them like her family. Kobayashi\u2019s life gets even more complicated when Tooru\u2019s other friends Fafnir and Lucoa makes their appearances. Speaking of Kobayashi, we can also see that she is slowly but surely warming up to Tooru. She is more accepting of her presence and the other dragons despite knowing how different they are compared to her. In the meantime, the others learn from Kobayashi about how human behavior works and even begins to adapt with their society. A clever example is Fafnir where he develops an addictive habit of playing video games. Another would be Kanna adapting with school life and making new friends including with schoolmate Riko. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, I think the primary successes of this show relies on its character chemistry and humor. Character relationships are important as it establishes personalities and allows the audience to understand them better. It also makes the show much more entertaining as we see how humans and non-humans interact. There\u2019s also change and development too with characters like Kobayashi, Fafnir, and Kanna. The way their roles are played out makes the audience curious about how far they can change. This is shown with characters such as Fafnir through his interaction with Makoto Takiya, Kobayashi\u2019s co-worker. Fafnir begins to accept and even becomes obsessed with video games and culture thanks to his influence. On the other hand, there\u2019s the comedy. It\u2019s freely defined and sells its humor without going over the board. Characters such as Kobayashi, Riko, and Tooru are prime examples of this as they display out-of-character qualities at times. (I mean, just look at Kobayashi when she is drunk!) In retrospect, the show makes an attempt to get the audience\u2019s to laugh and I have to admit, it works.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, the show expands parts of its adaptation in certain episodes to give some more vivid details of storytelling. However, not everything is faithful as one particular episode goes entirely on an anime original route. Also because this is airing on television, the adaptation is more tamed compared to the manga. In other words, the original source has much more lascivious scenes and suggestive innuendos. That actually also brings up another point as well. The show portrays itself as a slice of life comedy but if you watch it carefully, there\u2019s also many parts with some adult humor. Whether it\u2019s the cultural references or some suggestive camera angles, it can get controversial at some cases.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation doesn\u2019t let down expectations when it comes to production quality. The show looks very colorful and filled with energy. Almost every character has their own distinctive look especially the dragons. Characters such as Tooru, Kanna, Lucoa, Elma, and Fafnir all display traits of their dragon characteristics. (Example: tail, horns, eyes, etc) In the meantime, director Mikiko Watanabe puts his talent to work and makes a strong impression. The way the camera angles are directed makes certain scenes feel impactful. The colorful action can also be very noticeable with spectacular choreography from early episodes. The series even has a charisma for decorative outfits as seen in certain episodes to make the characters look more fashionable. The only questionable tactic the show uses at times is its fan service. Lucoa is probably the guiltiest of this as she wears skimpy outfits and a running gag of the show even has her being on top of Shouta.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought the art presentation was impressive, then soundtrack doesn\u2019t fall far from that level either. While it can be dismissed at times at being dull, the overall delivery is well crafted and fitting for the slice of life genre. OP and ED theme songs are highly decorated with colorful themes. The voice mannerisms of characters defines their personalities especially for characters like Kanna and Fafnir. I also have to give praise to Kanna\u2019s VA praise for portraying her character at an exceptional level. It\u2019s not always easy to voice a child character but Maria Naganawa made her sound very convincing.\\n\\n\r\nAh Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, a show with quite a peculiar title. I mean, a dragon maid is the last thing you\u2019ll expect to see in slice of life stories these days. Yet, this show cleverly gives its character cast freedom to be what they want. While this show doesn\u2019t involve any complex storytelling, it makes it up with its very distinctive character cast. It has the ingredients of cooking up good humor and doesn\u2019t hold back to deliver just that. I can\u2019t say this enough but really give this show a try. It looks stupid at first glance but the more you watch it, then more you\u2019ll find it entertaining. Trust me, it earned it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragons are well-known to be fierce creatures of legend, but they can also be regarded as the personifications of good. In cartoons, children's books, and family films, dragons are often depicted as friends of men. In certain cultures, dragons are portrayed as heavenly creatures.\r\nWhile all these representations are interesting, none are as adorable, nor as lovely as that of Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: a whimsical tale about the life of a lonely programmer and her fantastical human-dragon hybrid friends.\r\nAs a character-driven gag series, Dragon Maid emphasizes its fun using an endearing cast. Protagonist Kobayashi may be your typical introvert, but it's hard not to smilewhenever she quarrels with Tooru\u2014the titular dragon maid who pledges herself to the programmer's service after a comical misunderstanding in the previous night. The stoic Kobayashi and cheerful Tooru are polar opposites, making their dynamic one of the most interesting feature of Dragon Maid. Their squabbles play a major part in evoking laughter from the audience, but there are more to them than just being elements of comedy. As the story progresses, their interactions between each other slowly develop their character, transforming them into sympathetic individuals. Dragon Maid is rife with good humor, but it's also filled with heartwarming scenes and strong character progressions that transcend it above the typical comedy.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the element that will be overlooked most often in Dragon Maid is the desire to be human. The dragons claim to despise humans, but their obvious curiosity in our species says otherwise. The ever-so-adorable Kanna is by far the greatest example of this: although the young dragon is jealous of Kobayashi claiming her beloved Tooru, she nevertheless gains an interest in enrolling to school to learn more about the human world. There, she meets Riko, an equally adorable human girl who helps Kanna learn the meaning of becoming human. Another character who experiences a similar development is Fafnir, a no-nonsense dragon who gradually mellows out of his old facade thanks to the eccentric yet kindhearted Takiya. Like Tooru, Fafnir is initially distrustful of humans but begins to adopt an alternate perspective once Takiya shows him the joy of playing video games and writing doujinshi. Of course, Kanna and Fafnir's antics are mainly played for laughs, but their desire to assimilate with human society is definitely worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nNo cast is ever perfect, and the same can be said for that of Dragon Maid. The three remaining characters\u2014Elma, Lucoa, Shouta\u2014range from underdeveloped to terrible. Elma is at least funny and cute when paired up with Kobayashi, but Lucoa and Shouta are simply unlikable. While the other characters have some sort of trait that make them endearing, this bizarre pair exists only for the sake of fanservice. Furthermore, the backstory of how they met is a forgettable five-minute scene that's never brought up again. From all the dragons, Lucoa seems to be the only one who does not enter any sort of development phase. True, it\u2019s likely this way because of her kindness to humans since the beginning of the series, but why not make this trait more prominent to the story? It would have been better if she aids the other dragons in getting along with Kobayashi and other humans, but alas, she did not. Some might complain that the intimate relationship between Kanna and Riko is troublesome, but I personally find it very cute in comparison with Lucoa and Shouta\u2019s nauseating bond.\\n\\n\r\nAs a charming series, Dragon Maid comprises adorable character designs and a colorful palette. Although the series takes place in a city, my personal favorite setting is the gorgeous grassy plains where Kobayashi, Tooru, and Kanna goes to play. The events that transpire there might only be a fleeting moment, but the beauty of the scenery\u2014especially the peculiar shot of the mantis and butterfly\u2014accentuates the natural beauty of the show. On what makes Dragon Maid most amiable, the visuals only lag behind the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is ridiculously catchy, but the ED and soundtrack\u2014except for the interlude theme\u2014are forgettable. On the other hand, Dragon Maid boasts some of the best anime voice cast in recent memory. Kobayashi\u2019s stern but motherly voice, Kanna\u2019s cute mumbles, and Tooru\u2019s energetic cheers are the three that deserve special attention\u2014without them, Dragon Maid would undeniably feel less lively. My personal thoughts? I could listen to Tooru\u2019s voice all day long without getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Dragon Maid worth watching? Yes, and much more. Not only is this gem of a comedy worth seeing, but it\u2019s also the best series of the Winter 2017 batch. Delightful characters, nice visuals, spot-on voice acting, and an interesting premise makes Dragon Maid a solid top-tier show.",

Despite it's intriguing concept combining dragon and maid and having bunch of these dragons and putting them live in normal life situations. This anime really knew how to make people interact with each other the way that makes these moe dragon concept work. They learn from each other and really work of each other  and develop from their adventures. That is really great and that is why this slice of life style anime is so enjoyable inmany way. It is not just for moe but so much more, really likable chars. that have distinct personalities from very different situations learning to live and interact in new situations like in RL. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nYou can really see these characters evolve and learn from their interactions and react to new situations and learn despite their very different backgrounds. Characters are enjoyable; loli dragon! and story is simple; everyday life events, and that's why it gets 8,5/10 rounded to 9/10.",

            "content": "Have you ever thought about making creepy people and pedophiles acceptable? well look no further because this anime is what you need, the \"How to Abuse jokes and make creepy characters appear acceptable by using the homosexuality shield\" anime is here, you also get the \"It isn't pedophilia because the one doing it is a female\" extra.\r\nJokes aside, in this review I'll talk about the comedy aspects and the characters so to start I have to say there is a big variety of character in this starting from cute characters to the creepy ones. \r\nThere are creepy and disturbing characters like Saikawa which i'm notsure if the mangaka wanted to make an acceptable version of a pedo so he made her, annoying characters like the otaku version of Makoto and Tohru (in the first 7-8 episodes) and useless characters like Elma which i'm not sure why she is there to begin with, it's not like she helped the plot progress or anything, even tohru's dad made the plot move a lot quicker than her and he only appeared in the last episode (which sadly had a cliche ending). \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand there are some good characters like Kobayachi, Kanna, the other version of Makoto, Fafnir and Elma who was useless but the 1 minute she appeared in in every episode was actually enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the interactions between the characters are well-written specially between Kanna and Kobayashi and Kobayashi and Makoto while some are just creepy like Kanna and Saikawa. \\n\\n\r\nNow the comedy in this show is weird, I would laugh at some jokes but they would overuse them till they started becoming annoying. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: every time Kanna touches Saikawa or looks at her she turns into the creepy pedo version which was disturbing from the very beginning, How is sexualising  a 6 Y/O and giving her an orgasm every time she touches Kanna be acceptable, people genuinely find this cute just because she is a lesbian and that really makes me disgusted with them because of how fucked up those people are and their way of defending this is the cringy \"You must be a homophobic\" argument, it's like those people are defending their own fucked up way of thinking tbh. \\n\r\nSame thing with Shouta and Quetzalcoatl but you know since this time it's a young boy with an older lady and not the other way around then people won't talk about it and about how creepy it actually is, also the fact that in the last episode they made the only cute scene between them when he pretended to exorcise her was just a sad way to try to hide all the other pedophilic scenes and say \"She is a caring girl and there is nothing sexual about their relationship\".\\n\\n\r\nOther than those examples and the annoying version of Makoto which I think was also there for comedic purposes the rest was really nice to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd before I end the review, I have to give credit to the people who worked on the art because it was very well-drawn from episode 1 till the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give this anime a 3/10.\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

Half way through the ending is dedicated to the dragon girls singing and its fucking adorable. Holy shit.\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nThis animes strong point is definately the characters, with everyone having their own quirk that makes me justenjoy watching them. The internet has decided the best girls is Kanna and Alma, but I feel Tohru, Quetzalcoatl and the main character Kobayashi are underloved.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\nI think if you're a fan of slice of life genre I would definitely look this up. I rate this a 8 gay dragons out of 10",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation has been something of a lost soul, struggling to find its identity in a post-Haruhi and K-ON world. It is through flipping back the dial and returning to their roots that their newest title, Maid Dragon, is able to find its footing. It feels like something that might have been animated once upon a time in 2005, and that is precisely what makes it so special in the modern climate of harem and superpower.\r\nAnd unlike many of their more recent titles, it knows what it wishes to be and never compromises its vision in a futile attempt to appease everyone and anyone. Itdoesn't play around with drama, and it never centres on action and explosions despite its cast of malevolent dragons. It's silly. It's relaxing. And it can even be a bit heartwarming when it tries, too. Have I also mentioned that Tohru is cute as all hell?\\n\\n\r\nSome may immediately wince and groan upon reading the series' synopsis. Maids plus dragons does not make for a very promising setting, nor does it seem like a combination that required much more than two or three seconds of thought. Everything that could possibly exist has, or inevitably will, receive some sort of series with cute girls indiscriminately slapped onto it. Modern anime has trained people to be cynical.\\n\\n\r\nBut to treat Maid Dragon as just another silly comedy with moe characters wouldn't be entirely fair, as there are a number of things it does quite differently. Kobayashi, the show's title character and languid protagonist, is a working adult rather than the conventional teenager. Whereas most anime of its nature would choose instead to play a teenager as some pseudo-adult (\"my parents are conveniently away on a business trip, so, hey, I have this house and this maid lady all to myself\"), Maid Dragon chooses instead to portray real adults with real issues. Kobayashi is so bored with the office-lady routine that she will choose to drink herself halfway to death after a long day's work. Such is life in much of Japan.\\n\\n\r\nBy portraying adult characters, the sense of family between Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kamui feels genuine. Kobayashi is the mother of the household, and she will snap back at her dragon friends whenever they do something unreasonable. She is strict, yet also caring, and tries her best to understand their difficulties with getting used to the human world. Even little things such as peeling oranges for the two on their kotatsu makes it clear that she appreciates their company, even if she may not always be clear and forthright about it. Maid Dragon is true slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi being female also helps to keep the show away from any unnecessary sexual undertones. If she were male, the show would no doubt be a harem, and it would be all the worse for it. It is hard to care about a cast when the only thing characterising them is accidental breast fondling (yay) and walking in on (and screaming at) each other in the bathroom. Yawn. While Tohru's feelings for Kobayashi are humorously exaggerated as being romantic, that is not Tohru's actual intentions, and indeed, her reactions come more from gratitude and a desire to protect her guardian, rather than anything genuinely romantic or sexual. The one exception is that, yes, there is a compulsory beach scene, although I suppose I can't fault it too much as it was relatively short and harmless (and because Tohru's body is a lovely sight indeed).\\n\\n\r\nMaid Dragon can occasionally be funny-- Tohru visiting Kobayashi's workplace and repeatedly tripping her crabby boss, or challenging one of the other dragons to a fight in another dimension only to close it on them-- but it isn't an anime that is particularly defined by laughs. It is meant more to be relaxing, and, undoubtedly thanks to Kamui's presence, cute, at times adorable. I just wish it didn't have to repeat the same joke about Tohru cooking her tail a million and one times over. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is at its strongest when it focuses on these main three, which makes the scenes with the other three dragons and Kobayashi's otaku friend, Takiya, significantly less appealing. Takiya's split personality is so jarring and exaggerated that he is often more obnoxious than anything, and Quetzalcoatl is pretty much a non-character whose only defining traits are that her boobs are large and that she likes to dress in scantily-clad clothing. If they were taken out altogether, I don't think anyone would find much reason to complain. More time should instead have been spent developing Kobayashi's cynical worldview, and Tohru's newfound interest in human society, the show's two most compelling themes. It would be nice for Kamui to also have something else to her besides simply being cute and snugly, but then I suppose it would be difficult to develop a character who is essentially the equivalent of a six or seven-year-old child. I sure as heck did not have anything else defining me at that age besides a love for candy and temper tantrums. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation's artwork is generally excellent, but it certainly stands out in Maid Dragon's case. While there are few scenes that draw particular attention for their animation, the cute and humorous expressions the characters make (notably Tohru and Kamui) make the anime a ripe for grabbin' screenshots. Tohru's eyes are especially detailed, and draw attention to her nature as a dragon while never seeming overtly inhuman. Bright colours and soft edges also do well to enhance the fluffy, relaxing atmosphere the anime strives for. Part of the problem I had with some of KyoAni's other titles, such as Hibike Euphonium, is that they just looked so bland and dreary all the time. It's always welcome to see them return to a more traditional style, as traditional, it seems, is the very thing that KyoAni is skilled at. \\n\\n\r\nTo label Maid Dragon as something stellar or ground-breaking may be giving it a bit too much credit, but there is little doubt that it is at least a return to form for a studio that has been losing its way for many a year. It is as well a fun time in its own right, an almost nostalgic recollection of what slice-of-life anime used to be, and could, can be once more.",

In order to repay her kindness. She becomes her maid, and with that, the Unending story between these 2 begin. I wonder how it'll turn out...\r\nCharacter (10)\r\nWhat can I say? All these characters (D)ominate my heart. The way Tooru would just cook her (D)elicious tail. But Kobayashi refuses becuz she thinkit's (D)isgusting. Total D's=3. I can assume that Tooru is a triple D cup. Tooru is the main dragon of the series with her big smile, big heart, big attitude, and big..oh so big breasts. I'm sure you are guaranteed one chuckle or laugh each episode. I love how much Tooru clings to Yashi (I'm saying Yashi cuz Kobayashi is too much to type on mobile) it's a cute way of showing gratitude...I guess. The relationship between Tooru and Yashi will probably increase as the show goes on. I thought these 2 would be the main focus of the entire anime...\\n\r\nUNTIL THIS CUTE AS FUCK LOLI DRAGON COMES INTO PLAY!\\n\r\nKanna, this girl must be my spirit animal. She is a loli done right. A loli who is not annoying as fuk and can still make u smile for 3/4ths of an episode. Her character design is great and her VA, give that woman a FUKKING raise :3.\\n\r\nQuet..Kwetzu...Quetzalcoatl...I'll just call her Q-Cup (which apparently she is..Q..cup) This character along with Fafnir has only been introduced lately and are still waiting for more character development from these 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni...cmon now.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\r\nIt's KyoAni...cmon now.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nIt's Kyo..k I'll stop\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the animes for winter 2017. This anime takes my full enjoyment. How can a slice of slice series like this, have more action than some action animes that I know? This is the only anime I know that they make badass things. Such as:\\n\r\n\"Playing\"\\n\r\n\"Dodgeball\"\\n\r\n\"And playing Dark Souls\"\\n\\n\r\nHow will u even compare? This series takes the cake regarding full enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nI guess because it's a SOL, there isn't too much to dive on except the fact that it hurts to wait 1 week for 24 minutes of god sauce. The characters are fun, the overall plot and premise proves to be interesting, and the animation...mmmm...tasty. I can't wait to see more of these characters and their crazy shenanigans. \\n\\n\r\nHowever I do have somewhat a concern for Tooru's past. Even Kanna's\\n\\n\r\nI just..idk...feel like something happened in the past. Like something not very good. Just a feeling though.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is the shortest review I've made thus far. I guess it's obvious considering this is a slice of life and a series to just sit back and relax with. I totally recommend this to anyone who wants something fun and exciting.

            "content": "~Multilingual review, English & Espa\u00f1ol: Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid~\r\nIn the Japanese culture there are two really heartwarming greetings that represent the core of the family bonds: 'Tadaima' (\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e) and 'Okaeri' (\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a), respectively meaning 'I'm home' and 'welcome home'. The exchange between these greetings happen when one person arrives home, and there is another one to welcome them back. While not strictly restricted to family members alone, and can be used colloquially between friends and acquaintances, even in workplace and school, these greetings carry a deep and strong meaning behind them, which is no other that 'this is the place I belong to'.\r\nAlthough there are manyfactors that determine the place we could call 'home', and some of them may, naturally, not include a physical person, in my personal opinion just because there is someone eagerly waiting for your return, and acknowledges that is only natural for you to come back, because this is your place, is nothing less what I would call 'the feeling of getting home'.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to chose which family born in, the choice of what to call our 'home' is entirely up to us, and that includes, the circle of people that will come to form part of it. Claiming that 'there are many types of families as there are stars in the sky' might be quite a silly over exaggeration, however it is not entirely wrong to say there are countless combinations and bonds that shape, what we would later call, 'our family'.\\n\\n\r\nMoving one step back to the things impossible to chose, and the next one in the list is: Falling in Love. However this might be a completely biased opinion since I am a total, silly, romanticist, but there is a thing I believe we all have to agree: It is a completely unexpected chapter in our lives. After all, while all the other emotions arrives from the front door, this little bastard show itself from the back door while you were standing there like a dumb trying to see if Happiness was also in the group. Falling in love with someone takes you completely by surprise, and so as well, in some cases, is the person fated to mess around your entire existence.\\n\\n\r\n                  Falling in Love + Different race + same gender = Love problems?\\n\\n\r\nIn this particular case, to scramble our protagonist life, is a certain dragon's unconditional Love. Blind as it is, but really really that blind that gender, age, and even race, represent nothing but just tiny details, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid features a mighty powerful dragon who falls in love with a female human, and although remaining an important lead, the show's gimmick does not spin entirely around it, to the extent that it would not fall under the Romance category, the show has way more to offer than a simple fairytale love story.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the story follows super mighty dragon Tooru, and her time in the human world after becoming Kobayashi's maid, the person she's completely infatuated in. Kobayashi is a young office lady leading an existence of the prototypical Japanese salaryman. Work until late hours, almost nonexistent private life, (sometimes forced) drinking parties with the boss, and obviously getting home so tired that just opening the home's door is the last action before collapsing to the floor, everyday repeat, repeat and repeat. And so the gray and monotonous everyday life of office lady Kobayashi starts to gain, definitely, more color.\\n\\n\r\nMeet the Kobayashi's household - Residents: 1 human + 2 dragons + \u2665 = Family\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life series as it is, the anime narrates the everyday life of Tooru, self-proclaimed 'Dragon maid', the somewhat stoic office lady, Kobayashi, and little dragon, Kanna. What I really liked the most about this show is how the three of them, with the progression of the story, started to develop the bonds of a real adoptive family, satisfying the affective desires of each other, and caring deeply for the wellbeing of the members. These developments can be seen throughout the great writing of the dialogues between the characters, I specially adored the interactions between Tooru and Kobayashi, as they were the ones that contained the themes which I expressed in the very beginning of this review, 'the place I belong to'.\\n\\n\r\nTooru's inner turmoil regarding the human world, and her love for Kobayashi, which contradicts the apparently hate and fear for the humanity, are a constant recurring theme for the entire anime's progression. The series explores other themes such as the diversity and integration, something entirely affecting the dragons living in the human world, and their feelings regarding it's inhabitant, because living among them does not necessarily means living with them.\\n\\n\r\n             Unknown world + Unknown people + Being different = Trust problems\\n\\n\r\nGoing back a bit to the part when I mentioned that all the family members satisfy the affective desires, we can perfectly observe how the relationship wheel spin, and how much these interactions affected the lives of our three main characters. Kobayashi is a really stoic, passive person, and the difficulties she has maintaining a relationship with the other characters are plenty visible to see, specially towards the affection that comes from Tooru, as she has never been close to anyone before, she does not know how to behave. The exchange is bidirectional towards the dragon maid's inner chaos due to the new life and her love for the female human, that allows her to soon discovering that even though she sees humans as inferiors, she does have indeed desire to understand them. And finally little Kanna, the dragon which embraces the new environment with curiosity and willingness to integrate.\\n\\n\r\nBeing realised by Kyoto Animation, we can aspect some really cute designs, fluid quality animation, and bright colors, as per the studio's standard procedure. Also the Original Soundtrack was very great too, they accompanied the events perfectly, I could not ask for better.\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion this is a great Slice of Life, although moving perfectly according to the standard of the genre, bringing nothing original nor unique to the industry, it succeeds wonderfully in developing the main themes the show reached out to us, transmitting the message and the values, that were set as a primary goal for the accomplishment of what I consider, Quality.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful characters + excellent development + Great rhythms = Must watch\\n\\n\r\n[Espa\u00f1ol - Traducci\u00f3n con la ayuda de mi querido amigo OnionSoda]\\n\\n\r\nEn la cultura japonesa existen dos saludos de verdad reconfortantes los cuales representan el n\u00facleo de los lazos familiares: 'Tadaima' (\u305f\u3060\u3044\u307e) y 'Okaeri' (\u304a\u304b\u3048\u308a), que significan respectivamente 'Estoy en casa' y 'Bienvenido a casa'. El intercambio entre estos saludos se verifica cuando una persona reci\u00e9n llega a casa, y a su vez, es recibido por la otra persona que se encuentra ya en ella. Si bien no es restrictivo al uso familiar, y puede ser utilizado entre amigos y conocidos, incluso en el lugar de trabajo y escuela, estos saludos cargan el peso de un fuerte significado con ellos, el me gustar\u00eda describir como no m\u00e1s que 'el lugar a donde pertenezco'.\\n\\n\r\nSi bien hayan mucho factores que determinan el lugar que llamar\u00edamos 'hogar', y naturalmente, algunos pueden que no incluyan una persona f\u00edsica, en mi opini\u00f3n personal s\u00f3lo por el hecho que haya alguien que espere ansiosamente por tu regreso, y reconozca que es normal para ti el hecho de retornar, porque este es tu lugar, es algo que nada m\u00e1s ni nada menos llamar\u00eda 'el genuino regreso al hogar'.\\n\\n\r\nA\u00fan siendo imposible la decisi\u00f3n de escoger en que familia nacer, la elecci\u00f3n de lo que decidimos llamar nuestro 'hogar' es enteramente al alcance de todos, y con ellos incluye, el c\u00edrculo de personas que se vendr\u00edan a formar alrededor. Exclamar una frase como 'existen tipos de familia cuanto estrellas en el cielo' llegar\u00eda a ser una tonta exageraci\u00f3n, de todos modos no estar\u00edamos en el error al decir que son incontables las combinaciones y lazos que vendr\u00edan a formar, lo que llamar\u00edamos luego, 'nuestra familia'.\\n\\n\r\nHaciendo un paso atr\u00e1s, a cuando habl\u00e1bamos de las elecciones imposibles, la pr\u00f3xima en la lista ser\u00eda: Enamorarse. De todos modos, esto podr\u00eda ser una opini\u00f3n parcial ya que soy un completo, tonto, rom\u00e1ntico, a\u00fan as\u00ed hay algo en que creo que todos tenemos que acordar: Es un cap\u00edtulo totalmente inesperado en nuestras vidas. Despu\u00e9s de todo, cuando todas las otras emociones pasan por la puerta principal, este peque\u00f1o bastardo se presenta por la puerta posterior mientras t\u00fa estabas ah\u00ed parado como un bobo tratando de ver si Felicidad estaba tambi\u00e9n en el grupo. Enamorarse de alguien te toma completamente por sorpresa, y lo es inclusive, en algunos casos, la persona destinada a revolver tu total existencia.\\n\\n\r\nEnamorarse + diferente raza + mismo g\u00e9nero = Problemas de Amor?\\n\\n\r\nEn este caso particular, a desbaratar la vida de nuestra protagonista, es el Amor incondicional de un cierto drag\u00f3n. Ciego como es, pero realmente ciego que el g\u00e9nero, la edad, e inclusive la raza, representan nada m\u00e1s que peque\u00f1os detalles, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid se enfoca en un potente y temible drag\u00f3n que se enamora de una chica humana, y si bien qued\u00e1ndose como un importante desenvuelve, la esencia del anime no gira completamente entorno a ello, al punto que no caer\u00eda en la categor\u00eda Romance, este show tiene m\u00e1s por ofrecer que una simple amor\u00edo de un cuento de hadas.\\n\\n\r\nComo mencionado anteriormente, la historia sigue al potente drag\u00f3n Tooru, y su estad\u00eda despu\u00e9s de ofrecer, forzadamente, sus servicios como maid a Kobayashi, la chica por la cual perdi\u00f3 la cabeza. Kobayashi es una joven trabajadora cuya existencia sigue los pasos del t\u00edpico 'salaryman' japon\u00e9s. Se trabaja hasta tarde, casi inexistente vida social, (a veces obligadas) salidas a beber con los jefes, y obviamente el llegar a casa tan destruido que, la \u00faltima acci\u00f3n antes de desplomarse al suelo, es abrir la puerta de casa. El continuo repetirse de los d\u00edas, una y otra vez. Es as\u00ed que con la llegada de los nuevos hu\u00e9spedes, el gris y mon\u00f3tono d\u00eda a d\u00eda de Kobayashi comienza a ganar, seguramente, m\u00e1s color.\\n\\n\r\nConozcan la residencia de los Kobayashi  - ocupantes: 1 humano + 2 dragones + \u2665 = Familia.\\n\\n\r\nSiendo una Slice of Life como lo es, el anime narra el d\u00eda a d\u00eda de Tooru, autoproclamada 'Dragon Maid', la ap\u00e1tica joven trabajadora, Kobayashi, y la peque\u00f1a drag\u00f3n, Kanna. Lo que realmente me encanto de esta serie es como las tres, con el desarrollo de la historia, comienzan a establecer los lazos de una verdadera familia adoptiva, que satisfacen las necesidades afectivas de cada uno, preocup\u00e1ndose mutuamente por el bienestar de los miembros. Esta progresi\u00f3n es llevada a cabo gracias a la buena escritura de lo di\u00e1logos entre los personajes, especialmente adore las interacciones entre Tooru y Kobayashi, ya que fueron los que conten\u00edan los temas con los cuales, anteriormente, decid\u00ed abrir esta rese\u00f1a, 'el lugar a donde pertenezco'.\\n\\n\r\nLa confusi\u00f3n interior de Tooru acerca el mundo humano, y sus sentimientos por Kobayashi, los cuales contradicen su aparente odio y miedo por la humanidad, son temas recurrentes por el entero arco narrativo de la serie. La serie explora temas como la diversidad y la integraci\u00f3n, cosas que afectan principalmente los dragones que viven en el mundo humano, y sus sentimientos acerca sus habitantes, porque vivir entre ellos, no necesariamente quiere decir vivir con ellos.\\n\\n\r\nRegresando un poco a la parte donde menciono que todos los miembros de la familia satisfacen sus necesidades afectivas, podemos observar como la rueda de las relaciones gira al rededor de la nueva presencia en sus vidas. Kobayashi es una chica de verdad estoica, y las dificultades que tiene al mantener las relaciones con los otros personajes son f\u00e1ciles de individuar, especialmente cuando se trata del afecto que le proporciona Tooru, siendo el caso de nunca haber sido tan cercana a alguien antes, no sabe c\u00f3mo comportarse. El cambio es bidireccional hacia el caos interior que tiene la dragon maid debido a la nueva vida que enfrenta y a los sentimientos que tiene por la chica humana, el cual le permite descubrir que a\u00fan reputando los humanos como inferiores, tiene de verdad deseo de entenderlos. Y por \u00faltimo esta Kanna, la \u00fanica que acepta el nuevo ambiente con curiosidad y empe\u00f1o a integrarse. Aun teniendo una mentalidad similar a la de Tooru, al ser un infante ella logra ver un mundo bajo una diferente luz, un lugar lleno de cosas que esperan a ser descubiertas.\\n\\n\r\nLa serie fue realizada por Kyoto Animation, por lo que podemos esperar dise\u00f1os bonitos, calidad de animaci\u00f3n fluida, y colores brillantes, como suele proceder el estudio normalmente. Tambi\u00e9n el audio fue bastante bueno, se acompa\u00f1a a la perfecci\u00f3n a las escenas y eventos, no podr\u00eda pedir algo mejor.\\n\\n\r\nEn mi opini\u00f3n personal esta es una gran serie SoL, si bien movi\u00e9ndose perfectamente de acuerdo al patr\u00f3n del g\u00e9nero, trayendo nada de nuevo o revelador a la industria, logra desarrollar, magn\u00edficamente, los temas que se propone, trasmitiendo el mensaje y los valores que fueron puestos como objetivo primario para el resultado de lo que reputo, Calidad.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes geniales + Excelente desarrollo + Muy buen ritmo = No hay que perd\u00e9rselo",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid- Making Anime Fun Again\r\nRemember when anime was pure, unadulterated fun? Racing home as if on a quest to save a dying loved one, plopping your giddy ass on the sofa and turning on your favorite after-school cartoon? Nowadays, myself included, people get ignorantly pretentious and critical when it comes to anime\u2026 most likely due to the accessibility of other\u2019s opinions on the internet (you\u2019re guilty MAL!). But what happened to the days when you could share a bond with another over some good, old fashioned Chinese cartoons? God forbid you meet some dragon t-shirted, fedora wearing pleb that only cares formainstream shounen... whilst peddling Magic Cards out of his mom's basement. Sometimes even I fall into an over-analytical stupor and forget what makes anime so damn entrancing and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe undeniably successful Studio KyoAni\u2019s 2017 release of Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is a breath of fresh air in a barrage of unoriginality and criticality. It\u2019s endearing, cute, charming and hilarious, and most of all is that it doesn\u2019t rely on \u201c2deep4u\u201d plot lines or edgy characters to become a hit. It\u2019s an anime that breathes nostalgia for me, crafting a diverse, likable cast that has one character for everyone to enjoy and although ramps down, never gets stale. Of course Kobayashi isn\u2019t perfect, but moreso perfectly imperfect. Accompanied by an outstanding script and stunning, extravagant visuals, KyoAni smashes the target of a true feel-good anime, leaving self-proclaimed pundits with little ground left to criticize.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to story, sometimes simple is best. Nothing in Dragon Maid seems contrived, but moreso plays out like a situational comedy. The story is straightforward:\\n\\n\r\n-A shut-in girl (Kobayashi) gets drunk and accidentally makes a deal with a dragon concealing herself under the masquerade of graciously endowed maid. (Tohru)\\n\\n\r\n-Tohru and Kobayashi take in an adorable loli dragon, Kanna.\\n\\n\r\n-The three of them (and some of Tohru\u2019s mythical adversaries) live out the seasons in an episodic, heartwarming anime that\u2019ll be sure to make you smile.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Dragon Maid is the pillar of the entire anime. As previously mentioned, the simple structure of everything helps add to the endearing, carefree atmosphere that the show contains. Whether it\u2019s a scene about cooking or a candid beach/Christmas episode, the script is constructed in the most efficient manner possible. There is an array of characters from Tohru\u2019s mysterious homeland deriving from mythology. There\u2019s Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec god of learning and self-reflection, as well as the Norse referenced Fafnir, who was cursed and turned into a dragon. Seeing these fictional personalities personified and placed into ordinary scenarios like playing video games\u2026 most specifically the scene where Fafnir was playing the Dark Souls-esque dungeon crawler. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is often slapstick or quick-witted, emphasizing the quirky nature of Tohru and her friends. Jokes are subtly slipped into scenes without being corny or abundant, and there more than a few historical and pop culture references thrown in to liven things up as well. It reminds me of a less overblown version of Nichijou (thank you KyoAni!). Above all other aspects of the writing, Dragon Maid has a unique tendency to make me feel just, comfortable. Whether it was the family bond that Kobayashi, Tohru and Kanna emulated or the cozy scenes where they just wanted to sit around and watch tv, I truly felt at home with these \u201cpeculiar\u201d characters. I certainly didn\u2019t expect such a simple show to hit my nostalgia buttons.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any show, there were some aspects I didn\u2019t care for, or that could\u2019ve been done better. There was a lingering yuri theme present between Kobayashi and Tohru that acrobatically teetered between friendship and something more. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m the only one that noticed this, but I can\u2019t say it was entirely necessary. Echoing this opinion was the relationship between Quetzalcoatl and her \u201cmaster\u201d. Fanservice is one thing, but her intrusive nature and suggestive sexuality was starkly convergent to the atmosphere present in the rest of the show. Lastly, the charm of Dragon Maid can tend to wear off over the length of the show, so I\u2019d recommend watching the anime in stages to prevent this.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi is a 9-5\u2019er; a twenty-something introvert who takes out her aggressions from her job over a beer or twelve at night. She\u2019s what most of us in that age bracket don\u2019t care to admit that we are. Tohru is a self-proclaimed servant, attempting to erase her past and start a more peaceful life on Earth. Tohru and Kobayashi both developed significantly throughout the series, and played off each other very well. Most importantly is that the writers did this without making it the focus of the anime. Kanna is truly the cutest thing in existence, and everyone knows it\u2026 and Fafnir\u2019s deep hatred for the human race slowly dissolved the more time he spent around them. The slow addition of side characters, and their mythological influence was reminiscent of The Devil is a Part Timer, only done significantly better.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni nailed it again when it came to animation. Colors are vibrant and lively, with Tohru\u2019s eyes set ablaze with a mix of red and orange hues. Although not \u201ctechnically\u201d superior to shows like Hyouka, Dragon Maid\u2019s art style takes on a life of its own. The character models are all so original and inviting, and the action scenes were a joy to watch. More similarities were present with Nichijou, especially Kobayashi\u2019s \u201cdead fish\u201d eyes, and the sporadic expressions on various character\u2019s faces. Beautiful work for sure.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of the most jolly, alluring OPs I\u2019ve ever come across, both due to the upbeat music and flawless animation. It tells its own story, one of innocent fun and excitement. I definitely put it on my phone already :P The ED is just as good, and acts as the punctuation at the end of each episode. I don\u2019t always listen to the ED all the way through, but I made an exception for this anime. I also enjoyed hearing the variety of tracks in the OST\u2026 with its overall cheeky tones and beats. The voice acting is superb, especially considering most of the cast is relatively unknown. Some of the better performances coming from Kobayashi and Tohru themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of this anime. The simplicity, coupled with the characters and overall coziness make a show I won't soon forget. I prefaced my review with a paragraph discounting criticality for a reason. Go into Dragon Maid to relax and have fun, nothing else. It's not intellectually stimulating, there's no abstract symbolism and there's no unnecessary ecchi moments. Enjoy it for what it is. I'd recommend this to fans of other heartwarming shows like Barakamon or Usagi drop, or fellow KyoAni-ites. They really surprised a lot of people with this show, and I'm certainly happy that I watched it. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "\"Ravioli, ravioli, don't lewd the dragon loli.\" Easier said than done when the anime is basically doing it for you already.\r\nI must admit that I have been rather critical of Kyoto Animation in the last few years. Such a talented studio who used to work wonders back in the day with titles such as Clannad, Haruhi, Lucky Star and K-On, but over the course of the last four years or so I have been rather disappointed with their series, with shows such as Kyoukai no Kanata and Musaigen no Phantom World really failing to live up to their previous standards. But Kobayashi-san Chi no MaidDragon actually feels like KyoAni finally returning to their roots, and for the first time in several years, it made me remember why I used to love this studio so much back in the day.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts with the typical adult office worker Kobayashi suddenly receiving a surprise visit one day... from a dragon. A dragon who then transforms into a human girl in a maid outfit and proclaims that she wants to live with her and work for her as her personal maid. As it turns out, Kobayashi had actually proposed the idea herself during some drunken escapade in the mountains earlier, and thus awkwardly finds herself having to invite the girl in. And thus begins Kobayashi's hectic everyday life of cohabitating with a dragon maid: Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a very simple series at heart but it works. It's reminiscent of KyoAni's wacky moe comedies of the past, and most of its success stems from the overblown characters and the stellar production value. Tooru is one big bundle of endless energy, in stark contrast to Kobayashi's deadpan and cool-headed personality. She is largely unfamiliar with how human society works as she came here through a portal from a different world, and as a result she sometimes suggests some ludicrous things such as haphazardly slaughtering people, and it is up to Kobayashi to keep her in check. Tooru is also rather openly affectionate with Kobayashi and repeatedly claims that she loves her, though Kobayashi mostly seems to see it as a child looking for parental affection rather than anything romantic for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIf the entire series had solely revolved around Kobayashi and Tooru though, it would likely have become stale and repetitive before long, but fortunately that is not the case. There are numerous other characters, most of them other dragons, who are introduced one at a time as the anime progresses. The first of these, and also the only other one who would have to be considered as one of the show's main characters, is Kanna Kamui: proud owner of the sexiest piece of loli ass in a very long time (not to mention her thicc thighs). In all seriousness though, everything about her just screams moe, and in my mind she is the real star of this anime. Her looks, her personality and behaviour, even her husky and emotionless voice; all of it is unbearably cute. I think she is right up there with the likes of Kafuu Chino and Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko as far as pure moe overdose levels go. Kanna's role in the story is as a young dragon who follows Tooru to the human world and eventually ends up living with Kobayashi as well. She acts like the child of the strange household and also starts attending a local elementary school due to wanting to experience everyday life in human society in a way befitting someone of her age. What her exact age actually is we are never informed of, but she is supposedly still over 600 years old in human years, so she is presumably of legal age enough to do whatever degenerate things you lolicons want to do to her. On top of being irresistibly adorable though, I think Kanna also brings out the best side of Kobayashi. As the story goes on, you can gradually see Kobayashi becoming more and more of a mother figure to Kanna with the way she treats her, through acts such as taking time off work in order to be able to visit Kanna's school's sports festival and trying to sneak in presents in her Christmas stocking just like how she believes Santa would do it. It brings a genuinely heartwarming touch to what is otherwise a relatively non-serious anime, but it all blends together really well.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the supporting cast there is also Kobayashi's fellow coworker and otaku Takiya, as well as three other dragons in the form of the reclusive and mysterious Fafnir, the diligent but na\u00efve Elma, and the easygoing and voluptuous Quetzalcoatl, more commonly known as Lucoa. Takiya and Fafnir have a sort of otaku bromance going on, which serves as a pretty nice contrast from the craziness going on whenever Tooru is around, and Elma functions well as the one dragon who can actually interact with Kobayashi on somewhat normal terms due to her personality and occupation. Lucoa however is the one character in this show which I honestly find rather useless. For one she is a typical fanservice character with gravity-defying breasts bigger than her head, but the way she utilizes them is kind of disturbing too. She does not move in with Kobayashi but rather lives in the house of a local child, and the way she interacts with him is basically through ignorant sexual harassment, which feels rather creepy to watch considering their milf and shota characteristics (the kid's name is literally Shouta I might add). Even outside that household though, the only thing Lucoa ever seems to do is jiggle her enormous knockers and nothing else. Her entire persona can be summarized by her tits. The show would really be better off without her.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is definitely not without its fair share of fanservice, however discounting Lucoa, the other stuff in that department that the anime has to offer is honestly more of a plus than a hindrance I think. Takiya and Fafnir may have a very close friendship past a certain point in the story, but it feels legitimately believable and honest rather than a pair of boys who just got shipped together for the hell of it or anything put into a sexual context. While I am sure the fujoshi crowd will have no problem overcoming that barrier, at least in the context of the show itself, their relationship only comes across as two people who became close friends due to a common interest of hobbies, in this case anime and video games. There are also numerous segments starring Kanna and her human school friend Riko, where it is made quite clear that the latter has a pretty huge infatuation with her dragon classmate. What exactly the nature of those feelings are is debatable considering Riko's young age, but either way there are many scenes of the two of them snuggling together and Riko being super excited about it as a result. It is kind of like a running gag throughout the show where Riko gets so excited over Kanna that she almost gets an ahegao as a result, which I guess is at least somewhat original instead of the more stereotypical nosebleed reaction. Kanna also does some rather surprising things to Riko in return sometimes such as spontaneously licking her on the cheek, but this feels more like an animalistic behavior caused by her non-human nature as she does not seem to mean it to be anything more than a friendly gesture, though of course Riko probably does not interpret it as such. Some people might find it a bit weird seeing two lolis being so physically affectionate with each other, but considering how clingy girls can be amongst friends combined with the facts that Kanna is a dragon and that Riko is highly exaggerated like most anime characters, it still feels believable to me. And also given how incredibly cute Kanna is as a character, it is not like I can blame Riko if she really does have some deeper feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production value, the anime is undeniably top notch. The fact that the art and animation is stellar should be a given since it is KyoAni we are talking about, and there is not a whole lot to say about it other than that it looks like KyoAni shows normally do: in other words fantastic. Since this is a throwback to their moe shows of old though, it is perhaps a bit more colorful than normal in order to fit the light-hearted nature of the show. The music department is also great: the OP and ED are both super catchy tunes and it also has some surprisingly good insert songs throughout the episodes themselves as well with a rather tranquil and artistic feel-good atmosphere to them, and the voice acting is all-round solid as well. There really is not much to complain about in these aspects of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all though, what you have is a well-directed and thoroughly entertaining anime which--while simplistic in nature--is very much aware of its own limitations and unapologetically embraces its own strengths. It shifts quickly between being over-the-top absurdity and relaxing yet heartwarming slice of life shenanigans, but the transitions are smooth and natural, and it is just as enjoyable in both ways. Yes, there are some things that could have been done better, and no, it is not the single best moe comedy ever made, but it is quite well above average at the very least, and definitely something well worth your time checking out.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nDiverse and likeable characters\\n\r\nTop tier moe, especially Kanna\\n\r\nOftentimes quite heartwarming\\n\r\nSuperb production value\\n\r\nSimple, light-hearted fun like the KyoAni of old\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nAlthough entertaining, it is not exactly hilarious either\\n\r\nLucoa is useless",

The concept has been done before, but never has it been refined to what Kobayashi is offering.\r\nIt's a simple comedy, but  yet it knows what it wants to be. Kobayashi knows it is simple, but funny and it makes no jabs at trying to branch out in territories unbound to them just for more fanservice.(Well aside from quetzalcoatl...yeah.)\r\nThe characters are from mythology, and that is what gives them refinement. The infamous Fafnir to Quetzalcoatl. All of themhave some form of unique marking inside of history itself and that gives the characters their own depth. But seeming them humanized and trying to adjust to society whilst the funny quirks that follow in an everyday life of living with dragons is what makes this show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIt is simple, but it knows what it wants to be and therefore it makes no other attempts in trying to be something else. It is there for us to enjoy weekly, and nothing more should be said about it. The show isn't complex, but that isn't needed for you to enjoy yourself with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the characters and their design themselves are simple as well, but they offer nice depth as well. Each of them have a distinctive outfit which matches their personality and archetype despite just being...simple.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something to simply smile, and just overall have a pleasant time watching: rest assured, as the everyday life of following a human as they watch dragon's humanize and adjust to everything will surely help you have a pleasant time. Kobayashi is a very enjoyable show overall, and I highly recommend those looking for something this season to give it a whirl, especially if you like simple animes.",

            "content": "I don't like this show. \r\nMaybe it's because I rarely enjoy SoL moe, and this one annoyed me more than usual due to the ungodly amount of praise it's gotten. Either way, I don't see how this show can be anything more than average to most people.\r\nThe story...it's SoL. There is no story. Episodes are a string of cute situations with various characters. This is how the genre functions. But how are the characters?\r\nThey range from cookie-cutter to slightly okay. Kobayashi and Tohru are both overplayed tropes; Tohru being a \"Naive other-worldly creature discovering the world\" and Kobayashi being her \"Deadpan caretaker\". At least halfthe jokes in the show consist of Tohru doing something that only a dragon would do, followed by a stoic reaction image from Kobayashi. It's funny the first couple times, then it gets old. \\n\r\nNext is Kanna, who the internet seems to have collectively fallen in love with. She's sort of decent; deadpan lolis are usually funny, but she almost feels like a fanservice character to act as a daughter to the two main characters - and, not surprisingly, she becomes the victim of pedo humor. More on that with these two. \\n\r\nLucoa and Shouta aren't in the show much, but their purpose is clear enough; Provide fanservice with a large breasted adult woman who wants to feel up an elementary school boy. Tasteful. \\n\r\nThe only other characters I can think to mention are Fafnir and Takiya, who are only there to make jokes about being nerds. Another concept that's funny at first with its references and homages to popular games/anime, but again, it gets old. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are good. It's KyoAni, no surprises here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't think this show has no merit at all, but it's carried along by tasteless fanservice and repetitive humor that always boils down to \"Dragon does something inappropriate in public\", \"Reference to anime/nerd culture\", or \"Look at these children in sexual situations\". \\n\\n\r\nI know this whole review sounds like it was written by an elitist who hates fun, but I just don't like this show, nor how much it's been forced in my face.",

            "content": "This anime season, Twitter won't shut up about Maid Dragon. There's a constant spew of GIFs and fan art, so I thought that maybe it was good. I thought wrong.\r\n   Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon starts off cute enough, with an at least *slightly* original premise, and a fair number of visual jokes that made me audibly laugh. As the series continued, the laughs where still there, but in fewer and fewer numbers as more characters were being introduced.\r\n   My problem with this anime is it quickly became another season of \"Pick Your Trope Waifu.\" Like, yo,we got Basic, we got Jailbait, we got Honkers, we got Edgelord, and our most recent addition, Basic 2.0. Take your pick. \\n\\n\r\nMost of these (Very underdeveloped, as of eight episodes out of what will most likely be twelve,) characters have running jokes at this point. Jailbait is always eating, Honkers is always bouncing around and teasing a child, (Which, like, geez,) and Edgelord is just being a NEET. Basic is her name. Pretty boring. Haven't seen much of Basic 2.0 because she showed up last episode, (8) but she seems ok. Kobayashi is also kinda boring, but her presence in the show isn't annoying, unlike a lot of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe point I'm making is that there is nothing special or new about any of the characters, and few actions have been made to invoke character progression. \\n\r\nYou have to be shallow and like the characters for just appearance and personality, and I'm not willing to do that, I want either original jokes, (Not the same ones every week,) or a story. \\n\\n\r\n   Speaking of story, where is it? It didn't need one, I think K-On! and Squid Girl did just fine without stories, but Maid Dragon has tried to get its viewers hyped about Basic's homeland/past and haven't elaborated. Either add story or leave it, don't put it up for 1 min. every other episode and act like I'm suppose to be dying to know what happens.\\n\r\nThe show just shoves any means of a narrative in favor of more waifu trash.     \\n\\n\r\n   Intro's catchy, the rest of the music sucks. JPN VA is generic, English VA is hilarious. (In a bad way.)\\n\\n\r\n   It's the average, bad, popular anime of the batch. I waited eight episodes to quit because I wanted to let all of the characters be introduced. After seeing Basic 2.0, I'm convicted this show won't change, and won't be worth my time to finish.",

            "content": "Honestly, I\u2019m not a fan of writing negative reviews since I prefer to use them to recommend series that I enjoyed, but as a fan of both comedy and the \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d genre I felt disappointed with Maid Dragon, that was the anime I was looking forward the most for this Winter 2017 season. I know that comedy is a very subjective genre, so I can see why other people would like it, so in this review I will talk about what I liked and what I didn't from this anime, while trying to keep it as a recommendation to give ita try as long as you're fine with what this anime delivers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a woman called Kobayashi finds a dragon named Tohru, that looks for a home to live, and after insisting she becomes Kobayashi\u2019s maid, from there other dragons start to appear and they become a part of the daily life of our protagonist. With each introduction we get hints that there is more to know about the dragon world and the conflicts that happen there, something that sadly doesn't get explored in this anime, and while I find that fine since this is just a context for the story and it\u2019s still early on to really need development, I still feel a bit disappointed because the idea is interesting and I wanted to see more.\\n\\n\r\nMy issues with this series (and in the end what makes me like a comedy or not) is the characters and the comedy itself. While some characters were fine the way they were (Tohru and Fafnir in special were pretty nice and I enjoyed most of their comedy bits), there are some that very early on reached a point where I was annoyed with them, and the constant repetition of their gag (even 4 or 5 times in an episode at times) without them getting any development during the series to make me feel that there was more to them than that, reduced a lot my enjoyment of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst in that list is the duo Kanna-Ahegao girl (she's called Riko, but she really deserves that nickname), Kanna is cute, I get it, everything she does is made to be an overdose of cuteness,  but all Ahegao girl did for the whole series was, yeah, doing an ahegao face when near Kanna because she was really cute like always, while some people find that face funny, I found it absolutely annoying right from the first time, and nothing about her character changed at any point to make the gag atleast funnier or different. One thing that really bothered me is how the series used Kanna for fanservice at times, and more considering how she has the attitude of a child. One scene with Ahegao girl in particular was very uncomfortable to watch and made me lose the hopes in ending up warming up to this anime sooner or later.\\n\\n\r\nBut if we're talking about uncomfortable, Lucoa definitely takes the cake here. I can resume her character in a single word: boobs, all of her comedy comes from them, either via having them bouncing, her wearing dresses that show them a lot (she even gets called as someone that \u201cdresses like a slut\u201d by Kobayashi, I'm dead serious), but definitely the worst part is her constant gag of breast smoothering a kid she lives with using them, I'm fine with some fanservice, but Maid Dragon reaches a point where I think that they went too far, both with how much it uses it, and to which characters the fanservices goes directed to.\\n\r\nFinally there is Kobayashi, our protagonist, that while I find her a pretty bland character, I think that this is exactly her purpose since she is there to bring the heartwarming moments of the series, related to her enjoying having all these weirdos around giving colour to the lifeless world around her due to her personality, I find that scenes well executed and I wish that the series revolved more around the family feel they create.\\n\\n\r\nIn the artistic part, well, it's KyoAni, really well animated moments in the scenes where the series needed them while staying nice from start to end. The series also provides a solid OST, with personal mention to the song that plays in the previously mentioned heartwarming scenes, that improved them a lot in my opinion, and the opening \u201cAozora no Rhapsody\u201d that is a very catchy song to start the episode in a nice mood.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, while I personally didn't enjoy this anime due to not being a fan of the comedy and the fanservice present in the series, it's definitely worth trying out if what I mentioned didn't bother you.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon was released in early 2017 and is a breath of fresh air in the modern climate of sexually-charged harem anime. Maid Dragon is a completely wholesome slice of life series with no sexual content or fanservice. Forget whatever you've seen online about it -- this is the kind of anime you can watch with your parents.\r\nThe series starts with a dragon, Tooru, who wants to work for the main character, Kobayashi, as a maid. Kobayashi was wholesomely blackout drunk when she first met Tooru and barely remembers the encounter, but apparently she offered Tooru a place tostay, provided that Tooru worked as a maid. You might expect such a premise to lend itself to sexually charged fanservice in order to pander to an audience of horny teenagers, but Maid Dragon avoids such baseness. You see, Kobayashi is a female -- an adult, even! So there can't be any fanservice, because lesbians are not a popular category of porn for straight male audiences.\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering how a dragon can be a maid. As it turns out, Tooru (and all the supernatural characters on the show) can disguise themselves as humans. In her human form, Tooru has large breasts that have a tendency to bounce, complete with sound effects. There's nothing sexual or fanservicey about that, and besides, it doesn't happen often. Only multiple times per episode. Another dragon, Quetzalcoatl (commonly called Lucoa) has even larger breasts, which tend to bounce even more. As such, Lucoa can properly be called a well-rounded character. The size of both dragon's breasts are the subject of envy by Kobayashi, and she comments on them throughout the series. This isn't an attempt at fanservice because that's just how all women talk to each other. In the first episode, Kobayashi takes Tooru's clothes off while they're drinking in a bar. You might think, \"Okay, that has to be fanservice,\" but again, it's okay because they're both women, and women do not have any sexual agency.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read much about this series, you may have noticed discussions and internet memes tend to focus on the character Kanna. Kanna -- who is listed first on MAL's list of characters despite not being one of the two main characters -- is what is referred to in some circles as a \"dragon loli\" and you are instructed not to \"lewd\" her. A lot of online commentary refers to her \"thicc\" thighs. This is actually a typo: they meant to type \"wholesome thighs\" but the keys were right next to each other. Mistakes such as this are very common in the Maid Dragon fandom.\\n\\n\r\nSince Kanna has the body of a child and attends the third grade, it would be extremely inappropriate to give her large, bouncing breasts with sound effects. No self-respecting anime would sexualize a child... so you'll have to read the Maid Dragon manga if you want to see a kid with large breasts. In one of the first scenes with Kanna, it is explained that she and Tooru cleaned each other with their tongues, and the viewer is shown a picture of said cleaning. The picture appears to show both characters in their human forms, but it is blurred out, probably because it's too wholesome and not sexually suggestive at all. You'll have to refer to the manga for an uncensored version of that as well.\\n\\n\r\nAt school, Kanna makes friends with a third grader named Riko. Though she dislikes Kanna at first, Riko eventually says that she would marry Kanna. Whenever there is skin-to-skin contact between the two children, in innocent circumstances such as accidentally brushing together, or playing twister, or Kanna sitting on Riko's lap, or Kanna straddling Riko, etc. etc., Riko becomes visibly excited, usually making an ahegao face. For the dear readers who don't know the definition of ahegao, here is what Urban Dictionary has to say:\\n\\n\r\n\"Ahegao: The anime/manga version of an orgasmic facial expression. It's generally very sexualized and lewd, and may or may not be accompanied with heart eyes/pupils.\"\\n\\n\r\nBecause you mustn't \"lewd the dragon loli,\" the Urban Dictionary must be mistaken in saying that ahegao carries sexual connotations.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining child on the cast is Shouta, whose name is not at all similar to \"Shota.\" Shouta attempts to summon a demon, but instead, Quetzalcoaltl hears him and decides to go live with him. Quetzalcoatl is the aforementioned extremely busty Aztec goddess of fertility, and one of the show's most wholesome sources of humor comes from her frequently pushing Shouta's face into her breasts, disregarding his objections and embarrassment. This might sound like she is molesting Shouta, but how can she be? There is nothing sexual about fertility goddesses. Shouta's parents are never seen, but one can assume that they're happy that he lives with such a responsible guardian.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a family-friendly show that I would recommend to anyone. It contains NO fanservice, and you don't need to give yourself a long look in the mirror if you enjoyed it. I rate it 10/10. \\n\r\nThanks for reading my first review!",

It's hard to find enjoyment in life and inspiration to keep moving forward when you're working at 2 in the morning and subsisting exclusively on Redbull and frozen pizza. \r\nDuring one particularly hard night, I was browsing twitter and came across a picture of an adorable anime character with purple and white hair. \"That's it!\" I thought to myself. \"This is what I've been searching for!\" I scrambled to my work computer to find more, and as I scrolled through videos and images for the series Kobayashi-san Chi no Dragon Maid, arealization slowly dawned upon me.\\n\\n\r\nThis character was more than just a cute animated loli. In many subtle ways, it resembled the old Gods and spirits of Aztec mythology. The patterns in her dress... The long, flowing hair... the resemblance was uncanny. But there was something more to it than that... some nigh incomprehensible, yet wholly palpable spiritual essence that I have yet to wrap my head around.\\n\\n\r\nI had to find more. I watched all of the episodes available to me with feverish passion, examining every colorful animated second of it. My conclusion: I was 100% correct in my previous assertation. Kobayashi-san Chi no Dragon Maid represents more than just what's visible on it's fluffy, well-written comedic surface. Instead, it's the beginning of a cultural zeitgeist, the ushering-in of the new \"moe\" era.\\n\\n\r\nIn time, people will look back and point to this show as the turning point in or global shared culture. Even farther into the future, they'll find statues of Kanna and Toohru in the shattered remnants of our civilization and piece together their story-lines, much like we have done with the wreckage of the great Roman empire.\\n\\n\r\nI could be wrong, of course. Maybe this is just a light-hearted romp with inventive and cute characters, fantastic animation, and fun comedic scenarios (the moe/comedy genre is KyoAni's forte, after all). However, I don't think that's the case.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be watching the entire series, that much is certain. I'll also be purchasing the various merchandise that the series spawns. Figures, posters, DVD, etc... all the evidence that future generations will be using to learn more about this incredibly important time in human development that we inhabit.\\n\\n\r\nYou can think I'm crazy if you want. Maybe sleep deprivation, paired with malnutrition and 3-hour-long hentai viewing sessions have reduced my brain to a mashed-poatato-like mush, and these are the rambling of a man who has finally lost his grip  on reality.\\n\\n\r\nBut what if I'm right?\\n\\n\r\nMy final verdict: 10/10. This series is a must-watch for both hardcore followers of anime and casual viewers alike.",

            "content": "When I started watching this show, I was so so excited about it.  I haven't seen a lot of yuri so I wasn't familiar with a lot of the tropes it used. But, despite some sort of awkward ecchi moments, I enjoyed it a lot. I really like the way that Tohru, Kobayashi, and Kanna's characters were developed for the first four or five episodes, and the slice of life aspects of it really appealed to me.\r\nBut, episode 6 was the beginning of the end with episode 7 being the nail in the coffin. The abrupt turn from a feel good, slice of lifeyuri to a pedo fanservice free-for-all was shocking and gross. The main characters were dropped in favor of pedo plotlines for side characters that made me 5000% angry and uncomfortable. 2/3 of episode six involved either the weirdly sexual scenes between two elementary schoolers, or Lucoa, portrayed as an adult female, sexually harassing a young boy. \\n\\n\r\nIt really gave me this vibe of the producer's having a total lack of confidence in their vision. Like, maybe they thought that not enough people would enjoy a fantasy-style, slice of life yuri, but surely they would get an audience if they threw in some horribly off color fanservice. It was so unbelievably disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSo I thought, 'Well, maybe this was just a fluke. Maybe this was their fanservice episode and they just completely bombed it.' But no, then comes the teaser for episode 7, titled simply 'The Fanservice Episode'. Needless to say, I didn't watch it. \\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine gushed over episode 8 and said that it returned to the original plot lines that I so loved from the first four episodes. So, I skipped episode 7 and went straight to 8, and I did like those plotlines. Yet, they can't just leave it alone. Every change in scene includes a disgusting pedo fanservice clip of Lucoa and Shota. I can't even suspend my distaste to enjoy a Tohru/Kobayashi centered episode, and it's so SAD.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really could have been very good. If they had just stuck to what had fans watching in the first place, which was the great slice of life and the development of Tohru and Kobayashi, then I think they really could have had a hit on their hands. But, by bombarding the audience with this pedo BS that literally no one asked for, they tanked their own work. In one episode, this show went from a 9 to a 5 from me, and it just keeps dropping.",

            "content": "*******\r\nKyoto Animation Studio\r\nOctober 6, 2016\r\nAfter enduring the taunts, jeers, and sneers that resulted from the underwhelming Myriad Colors Phantom World, Mr. Hideaki Hatta, the president of Kyoto Animation, decided to recommit to the conventional. He guided the studio producers into a months-long effort in crafting a sequel to the massively successful Sound! Euphonium. When the dust settled, KyoAni\u2019s staff, with the utmost confidence, released Sound! Euphonium 2, and then they celebrated. They engaged in several rounds of poker, and they consumed multiple tabs of LSD (One employee in particular swallowed six tabs at once), as well as a large helping of cocaine. 4 hours passedbefore Mr. Hatta summoned his employees into the meeting room. He stated, \u201cI know that we already took care of the Fall season with Sound! Euphonium 2 but we need something to air in the winter. Any ideas, guys?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe KyoAni employees, still buzzed from the booze, drugs, and other late-night adventures, quietly remained in a state of half-consciousness.\\n\\n\r\nMr. Hatta, visibly exasperated, muttered hopelessly, \u201cJust blurt out the first thing that pops in your head.\u201d It was Jiro Tazaki, a fresh-faced intern on his first day, that spoke up. It remains a mystery if it was the LSD, the alcohol, or God Himself that planted the idea in Tazaki\u2019s mind but on that day, the concept he introduced would be the catalyst behind KyoAni\u2019s latest heavy-hitter project.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Mr. Hideaki Hatta spoke, what Jiro Tazaki responded with was, \u201cBouncing dragon tits.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n*******\\n\\n\r\nWith that, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon was born.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that could turn away potential viewers, it\u2019s the cutesy character designs. From the woefully oversized eyes to the roundness of the character\u2019s frames, and even the rose-tinted cheeks, the character designs are a victim of mo\u00e9 overdose. Then again, realism has always been a foreign concept for Kyoto Animation, so no surprise there.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon prides itself in its humor but early on, its comedy is a bit too dependent on unnecessary boob grabs for its own good. While that element is minimized yet never erased, the show leans more and more on its Fish out of Water jokes as the runtime progresses, and this is where the show strikes comedy gold. There are more than a few instances in which Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon constructs an exaggerated, fantastical contrast to real-world occurrences. When the characters are shopping for school supplies, a common stapler is interpreted as a torture device. When one character seeks to learn about sports festivals, events like running, ball-tossing, and tug o\u2019 war are processed as medieval tactics in battle. It\u2019s scenes like those that aid Tohru (Miss \u201cBouncing Dragon Tits\u201d herself), and her other fire-breathing friends in adjusting to a world not their own.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s right here that you\u2019d be tempted to think, \u201cSlice-of-life/comedy about characters from a different world living on our own? Hey, this is The Devil is a Part-Timer all over again!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhile Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon does have a similar premise with that of The Devil is a Part-Timer, that is the extent to which these two titles are identical. While The Devil is a Part-Timer has its characters lead normal lives in a day or two, it requires a month for this show to do the same. While The Devil is a Part-Timer allows its characters to showcase their abilities in broad daylight, there are consequences that occur when this show does the same. While The Devil is a Part-Timer maneuvers its supporting characters to the sidelines, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon allows its relatively minor characters (like the domineering Riko Saikawa, the perpetually anxious Shouta, or (my personal favorite) the brooding Fafnir) to claim their moments in the spotlight. While The Devil is a Part-Timer briefly mentions the characters\u2019 past lives and never bothers to provide details, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon reflects on the bygone days and consistently links that to the cast\u2019s arcs. In short, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon embarks on the same path as The Devil is a Part-Timer yet it contains a more enhanced storyline than the latter, as well as greater character depth.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, the aforementioned character depth is what distinguishes this series from its peers, the method in which depth is handled as flawed at best. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon exists on the strained relationship between humans and dragons, as well as attempts to rectify this dynamic. However, the razor-sharp focus on this concept, though admirable, prevents this show from delving into potentially fantastic subplots. Sure, there are a few discussions about familial dynamics and self-exploration, but ultimately the show never truly ponders on these ideas. Though it appears quite underwhelming, the (very) limited range of thematic elements in Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon shouldn\u2019t automatically blacklist this title (After all, Onihei isn\u2019t exactly a paragon of versatility yet there are many, myself included, that consider it to be this season\u2019s hidden gem). However, I must advise you to be prepared for this show\u2019s \u201cserious scenes\u201d. Suffocating beneath the overwhelming weight of the warm, childlike atmosphere of the show, these segments provide a complete contrast to the rest of the series. At first, they carried grace, sophistication, and a unique charm (CGDCT + pathos wasn\u2019t a formula I encountered before) but later on, it felt as though these segments were recycling the same handful of storyline beats over and over. By the fifth episode, I was bored to tears, and apparently so was KyoAni\u2019s brain trust. They ensured that the serious scenes received a mercifully short runtime with each appearance.\\n\\n\r\nAmbition is a trait that I absolutely covet when it involves anime. There are few things I adore more than witnessing an anime series journey beyond the conventional. With this series, however, I am satisfied with its exercise in normalcy. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon doesn\u2019t desire to reinvent the wheel nor to \u201csave anime\u201d in the vein of Studio Trigger. No; what it seeks is to entertain, and on that front, it has more than succeeded. Whether it\u2019s the witty sexual innuendos, Tohru trolling Miss Kobayashi\u2019s short-tempered supervisor, or her utterly breathtaking chasedown of a purse snatcher, Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon guarantees excitement. And that\u2019s just fine with this run-of-the-mill reviewer. For once, the hype is justified.\\n\\n\r\n6 dodgeball-playing dragons out of 10",

            "content": "Once every now and then, we get some strange premise that gets animated on television. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is one such title that is probably more appealing to be quoted than anything else at first. Literally translating to Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid, it\u2019s definitely a title that will raise some eyebrows. I mean really, a dragon as a maid? That\u2019s the probably one of the silliest ideas if you think about it on paper. It also shouldn\u2019t be surprising as it\u2019s one of Cool-kyou Shinga\u2019s works. The author is known for expressing a lot of freedom in ideas. As such, watching this showwith an open mind will definitely bring in a lot of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nWho would have thought that Kyoto Animation would be the studio to adapt this show? Unlike some of the author\u2019s other works (which turned out to be very short shows), this one runs for full length. Make no mistake about it though, the series is exactly what it sounds like. The first episode pretty much establishes the general concept as we meet Kobayashi, a young software programmer living her normal life in Tokyo. Life take a turn for her when she unknowingly saves a dragon named Tooru during one of her drunken scenarios. Fate follows and soon, Kobayashi has her own personal maid. Err, dragon maid. As you can judge from this premise, the show is portrayed more or less a slice of life fantasy. Despite being a dragon, Tooru isn\u2019t entirely violent although she does possesses a disdain for humans. The only human that she seems to care the most is Kobayashi. In fact, she even develops a girly crush on her to the point of being devotion. That\u2019s what really makes this show so entertaining because at its core, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon always seeks to have fun by expanding on its ideas into a colorful fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe series consists a diverse yet noticeable character cast. I\u2019ll be honest though, main female protagonist Kobayashi is probably the least interesting character. She is the epitome of normal in this show when compared to others. Face it, she looks plain with an average paying job and average personality. However, Tooru finds her very appealing because she is honest to others and herself. Speaking of Tooru, she stands out as the most interesting character in the show. Coming from an entirely different world, it\u2019s no surprise that she lacks common sense about Earth and its people. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s shown that she lacks knowledge about being a maid at all. She also has virtually no experience with technology, cooking, or job skills. However, Tooru adapts well or at least she tries. Kobayashi is her main motivation to improve and she even comes to like Earth as time passes on.\\n\\n\r\nOther noticeable characters in the show is a young dragon named Kanna. As one of the youngest characters in the show, she behaves exactly like a child. In the beginning, Kanna has a disdain for Kobayashi and wants Tooru to return with her to their world. However as time progresses, she is more accepting of Kobayashi and even starts treating them like her family. Kobayashi\u2019s life gets even more complicated when Tooru\u2019s other friends Fafnir and Lucoa makes their appearances. Speaking of Kobayashi, we can also see that she is slowly but surely warming up to Tooru. She is more accepting of her presence and the other dragons despite knowing how different they are compared to her. In the meantime, the others learn from Kobayashi about how human behavior works and even begins to adapt with their society. A clever example is Fafnir where he develops an addictive habit of playing video games. Another would be Kanna adapting with school life and making new friends including with schoolmate Riko. \\n\\n\r\nIn essence, I think the primary successes of this show relies on its character chemistry and humor. Character relationships are important as it establishes personalities and allows the audience to understand them better. It also makes the show much more entertaining as we see how humans and non-humans interact. There\u2019s also change and development too with characters like Kobayashi, Fafnir, and Kanna. The way their roles are played out makes the audience curious about how far they can change. This is shown with characters such as Fafnir through his interaction with Makoto Takiya, Kobayashi\u2019s co-worker. Fafnir begins to accept and even becomes obsessed with video games and culture thanks to his influence. On the other hand, there\u2019s the comedy. It\u2019s freely defined and sells its humor without going over the board. Characters such as Kobayashi, Riko, and Tooru are prime examples of this as they display out-of-character qualities at times. (I mean, just look at Kobayashi when she is drunk!) In retrospect, the show makes an attempt to get the audience\u2019s to laugh and I have to admit, it works.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, the show expands parts of its adaptation in certain episodes to give some more vivid details of storytelling. However, not everything is faithful as one particular episode goes entirely on an anime original route. Also because this is airing on television, the adaptation is more tamed compared to the manga. In other words, the original source has much more lascivious scenes and suggestive innuendos. That actually also brings up another point as well. The show portrays itself as a slice of life comedy but if you watch it carefully, there\u2019s also many parts with some adult humor. Whether it\u2019s the cultural references or some suggestive camera angles, it can get controversial at some cases.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation doesn\u2019t let down expectations when it comes to production quality. The show looks very colorful and filled with energy. Almost every character has their own distinctive look especially the dragons. Characters such as Tooru, Kanna, Lucoa, Elma, and Fafnir all display traits of their dragon characteristics. (Example: tail, horns, eyes, etc) In the meantime, director Mikiko Watanabe puts his talent to work and makes a strong impression. The way the camera angles are directed makes certain scenes feel impactful. The colorful action can also be very noticeable with spectacular choreography from early episodes. The series even has a charisma for decorative outfits as seen in certain episodes to make the characters look more fashionable. The only questionable tactic the show uses at times is its fan service. Lucoa is probably the guiltiest of this as she wears skimpy outfits and a running gag of the show even has her being on top of Shouta.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought the art presentation was impressive, then soundtrack doesn\u2019t fall far from that level either. While it can be dismissed at times at being dull, the overall delivery is well crafted and fitting for the slice of life genre. OP and ED theme songs are highly decorated with colorful themes. The voice mannerisms of characters defines their personalities especially for characters like Kanna and Fafnir. I also have to give praise to Kanna\u2019s VA praise for portraying her character at an exceptional level. It\u2019s not always easy to voice a child character but Maria Naganawa made her sound very convincing.\\n\\n\r\nAh Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, a show with quite a peculiar title. I mean, a dragon maid is the last thing you\u2019ll expect to see in slice of life stories these days. Yet, this show cleverly gives its character cast freedom to be what they want. While this show doesn\u2019t involve any complex storytelling, it makes it up with its very distinctive character cast. It has the ingredients of cooking up good humor and doesn\u2019t hold back to deliver just that. I can\u2019t say this enough but really give this show a try. It looks stupid at first glance but the more you watch it, then more you\u2019ll find it entertaining. Trust me, it earned it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragons are well-known to be fierce creatures of legend, but they can also be regarded as the personifications of good. In cartoons, children's books, and family films, dragons are often depicted as friends of men. In certain cultures, dragons are portrayed as heavenly creatures.\r\nWhile all these representations are interesting, none are as adorable, nor as lovely as that of Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid: a whimsical tale about the life of a lonely programmer and her fantastical human-dragon hybrid friends.\r\nAs a character-driven gag series, Dragon Maid emphasizes its fun using an endearing cast. Protagonist Kobayashi may be your typical introvert, but it's hard not to smilewhenever she quarrels with Tooru\u2014the titular dragon maid who pledges herself to the programmer's service after a comical misunderstanding in the previous night. The stoic Kobayashi and cheerful Tooru are polar opposites, making their dynamic one of the most interesting feature of Dragon Maid. Their squabbles play a major part in evoking laughter from the audience, but there are more to them than just being elements of comedy. As the story progresses, their interactions between each other slowly develop their character, transforming them into sympathetic individuals. Dragon Maid is rife with good humor, but it's also filled with heartwarming scenes and strong character progressions that transcend it above the typical comedy.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the element that will be overlooked most often in Dragon Maid is the desire to be human. The dragons claim to despise humans, but their obvious curiosity in our species says otherwise. The ever-so-adorable Kanna is by far the greatest example of this: although the young dragon is jealous of Kobayashi claiming her beloved Tooru, she nevertheless gains an interest in enrolling to school to learn more about the human world. There, she meets Riko, an equally adorable human girl who helps Kanna learn the meaning of becoming human. Another character who experiences a similar development is Fafnir, a no-nonsense dragon who gradually mellows out of his old facade thanks to the eccentric yet kindhearted Takiya. Like Tooru, Fafnir is initially distrustful of humans but begins to adopt an alternate perspective once Takiya shows him the joy of playing video games and writing doujinshi. Of course, Kanna and Fafnir's antics are mainly played for laughs, but their desire to assimilate with human society is definitely worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nNo cast is ever perfect, and the same can be said for that of Dragon Maid. The three remaining characters\u2014Elma, Lucoa, Shouta\u2014range from underdeveloped to terrible. Elma is at least funny and cute when paired up with Kobayashi, but Lucoa and Shouta are simply unlikable. While the other characters have some sort of trait that make them endearing, this bizarre pair exists only for the sake of fanservice. Furthermore, the backstory of how they met is a forgettable five-minute scene that's never brought up again. From all the dragons, Lucoa seems to be the only one who does not enter any sort of development phase. True, it\u2019s likely this way because of her kindness to humans since the beginning of the series, but why not make this trait more prominent to the story? It would have been better if she aids the other dragons in getting along with Kobayashi and other humans, but alas, she did not. Some might complain that the intimate relationship between Kanna and Riko is troublesome, but I personally find it very cute in comparison with Lucoa and Shouta\u2019s nauseating bond.\\n\\n\r\nAs a charming series, Dragon Maid comprises adorable character designs and a colorful palette. Although the series takes place in a city, my personal favorite setting is the gorgeous grassy plains where Kobayashi, Tooru, and Kanna goes to play. The events that transpire there might only be a fleeting moment, but the beauty of the scenery\u2014especially the peculiar shot of the mantis and butterfly\u2014accentuates the natural beauty of the show. On what makes Dragon Maid most amiable, the visuals only lag behind the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is ridiculously catchy, but the ED and soundtrack\u2014except for the interlude theme\u2014are forgettable. On the other hand, Dragon Maid boasts some of the best anime voice cast in recent memory. Kobayashi\u2019s stern but motherly voice, Kanna\u2019s cute mumbles, and Tooru\u2019s energetic cheers are the three that deserve special attention\u2014without them, Dragon Maid would undeniably feel less lively. My personal thoughts? I could listen to Tooru\u2019s voice all day long without getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Dragon Maid worth watching? Yes, and much more. Not only is this gem of a comedy worth seeing, but it\u2019s also the best series of the Winter 2017 batch. Delightful characters, nice visuals, spot-on voice acting, and an interesting premise makes Dragon Maid a solid top-tier show.",

This anime really knew how to make people interact with each other the way that makes these moe dragon concept work. They learn from each other and really work of each other  and develop from their adventures. That is really great and that is why this slice of life style anime is so enjoyable inmany way. It is not just for moe but so much more, really likable chars. that have distinct personalities from very different situations learning to live and interact in new situations like in RL. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nYou can really see these characters evolve and learn from their interactions and react to new situations and learn despite their very different backgrounds. Characters are enjoyable; loli dragon! and story is simple; everyday life events, and that's why it gets 8,5/10 rounded to 9/10.",

            "content": "Have you ever thought about making creepy people and pedophiles acceptable? well look no further because this anime is what you need, the \"How to Abuse jokes and make creepy characters appear acceptable by using the homosexuality shield\" anime is here, you also get the \"It isn't pedophilia because the one doing it is a female\" extra.\r\nJokes aside, in this review I'll talk about the comedy aspects and the characters so to start I have to say there is a big variety of character in this starting from cute characters to the creepy ones. \r\nThere are creepy and disturbing characters like Saikawa which i'm notsure if the mangaka wanted to make an acceptable version of a pedo so he made her, annoying characters like the otaku version of Makoto and Tohru (in the first 7-8 episodes) and useless characters like Elma which i'm not sure why she is there to begin with, it's not like she helped the plot progress or anything, even tohru's dad made the plot move a lot quicker than her and he only appeared in the last episode (which sadly had a cliche ending). \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand there are some good characters like Kobayachi, Kanna, the other version of Makoto, Fafnir and Elma who was useless but the 1 minute she appeared in in every episode was actually enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the interactions between the characters are well-written specially between Kanna and Kobayashi and Kobayashi and Makoto while some are just creepy like Kanna and Saikawa. \\n\\n\r\nNow the comedy in this show is weird, I would laugh at some jokes but they would overuse them till they started becoming annoying. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: every time Kanna touches Saikawa or looks at her she turns into the creepy pedo version which was disturbing from the very beginning, How is sexualising  a 6 Y/O and giving her an orgasm every time she touches Kanna be acceptable, people genuinely find this cute just because she is a lesbian and that really makes me disgusted with them because of how fucked up those people are and their way of defending this is the cringy \"You must be a homophobic\" argument, it's like those people are defending their own fucked up way of thinking tbh. \\n\r\nSame thing with Shouta and Quetzalcoatl but you know since this time it's a young boy with an older lady and not the other way around then people won't talk about it and about how creepy it actually is, also the fact that in the last episode they made the only cute scene between them when he pretended to exorcise her was just a sad way to try to hide all the other pedophilic scenes and say \"She is a caring girl and there is nothing sexual about their relationship\".\\n\\n\r\nOther than those examples and the annoying version of Makoto which I think was also there for comedic purposes the rest was really nice to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd before I end the review, I have to give credit to the people who worked on the art because it was very well-drawn from episode 1 till the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give this anime a 3/10.\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

Half way through the ending is dedicated to the dragon girls singing and its fucking adorable.

If you do not like Yuri, and are sick of gay relationship then you should not watch it. If you do not like Slice of Life (and I mean that in this show almost no plot just cute dragons and several people trying to have fun and enjoy their lives) this is definitely not your show.  And if you hate fan service in any form. Now that I have done everything possible to weed out all the people who can not appreciate thisanime. We can move on to why I simply adore it at the moment. \\n\r\n  Despite the fact that it is incredibly funny show full of very ironic humor (cursed black dragon that plays dark souls). And the amount of  cuteness in this show so big that after 5 episodes in a row, you risk getting to the hospital with diabetes.  I would like to highlight three things that make this anime special.\\n\r\n  Characters\\n\r\n  The design of each character is unique and meets his personality. For example Tooru has a lively and open personality and she has a bright color hair and eyes. Meanwhile, in the design of Kanna much quieter character dominate white and pastel \u0441olor. Also their design in the dragon form also\\n\r\nvery cool.\\n\r\n  Motivation of the characters\\n\r\n  And I want to distinguish this specific point because I was struck deeply at how badly characters in this anime want to do what they do. How much Tooru wants to be with Kabayashi, with what pleasure she deals with housework. How Kanna wants to be a child. How much Fafnir wants to move from the cave with treasures and become otaku to live in the basement (irony again). For me it was an incredible surprise.\\n\r\n  Atmosphere\\n\r\n  What really stands out this anime is that almost every episode has moments that just very heartwarming. And the relationship between the Tooru, Kanna and Kobayashi very charming and sincere (it's hard to explain but the atmosphere here is incredible). \\n\r\n  And that to me is not as important and more as a nice bonus Art and especially the backgrounds they are simply wonderful and the music is great and it is memorable.\\n\r\n  Overall this is a very fun and cute anime I got a lot of pleasure from it and I hope that you too.",

            "content": "Every season there seems to be that one show that grabs everyone's attention. Whether it be the super cute girls it contains or it's the one shinning diamond in the rough of the season, there will always be that one show every season that everyone either loves or hate. And without a doubt, that show this season is Kobayashi-san.\r\nOur story begins with our mild-mannered worker gal Kobayashi getting a visit from a literal dragon. And it turns out, that while she was drunk she promised it a home in the form of her apartment. The only catch is (of course) the dragon can turn intoa cute and spunky maid known as Tooru at anytime and antics ensue. As far as story goes it's a pretty interesting set-up that quickly dives in to the typical fish out of water story where a character who has no idea of how the world she lives in currently works and must get adjusted to it. Of course you'll have the occasional antics of \"Hey I used all of my strength in a situation where I shouldn't have\" or \"Whoops wrong form\" but then it just quickly dissolves into those two gags with little to no variation or progression beyond that. I am now halfway through the show and so far every episode has gone as followed;\\n\r\n-Tooru and Kanna do something or say something too literally\\n\r\n-Kobayashi tells them otherwise\\n\r\n-Tooru disses and hates on humans\\n\r\n-Kobayashi does a good deed\\n\r\n-Tooru goes \"It's not like I like you or anything baka\"\\n\r\nAnd that is literally all we have gotten in terms of our \"story so far.\" Sure we've gotten 2 other dragons added besides them; Quetzalcoatl and Fafnir, but they two exist purely as \"The slutty big sister\" and \"The edgy dad\" neither one adding anything to the story regardless.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as far as art and sound, this is one of the show's saving graces. Kyoto Animation was the studio behind this, so obviously this show's gonna look and sound great. Both the intro and ending sound catchy as hell along with everyone's voices taking their tropes to the extreme. Everyone has their bright and unique fashion scene which both blends and contrasts with the outside world they inhabit, further giving them \\n\r\nthat \"distant world\" appearance. Nearly perfect on this end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally; the characters. This for many people with either make or break the show, considering this series has a somewhat small cast working to carry it. I must state that one-dimensional characters are not bad characters by any means. If said character is fun to watch through their extreme trope, they can be somewhat fun. However, that one dimension can wear out so easily if they're not fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon's characters are the literal definition of one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi herself, while being the most interesting character, has two modes; \"I'm Tooru's mom\" mode, and \"Woah dragons are spooky\" mode. Besides getting super passionate about how maids work when drunk, she is either distantly monotone until Tooru takes something to the extreme, or super motherly when Tooru messes up. And there is no other mood.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the cute satan spawn herself, Tooru has one more mode than Kobayashi; \"I'm gonna look down on humans and suddenly try to mood swing the episode\" mode, \"Kobayashi just breathed and suddenly I'm soaked\" mode, and \"I have the IQ of a 4 year old\" mode, and so on and so forth. None of these characters mentioned and the others have grown at all besides \"Oh I get this now\" or \"Oh I respect that\" now. Every episode will have Kanna being cute, Tooru being Tooru, Quetzalcoatl being slutty, Fanfir being overly-serious, and Kobayashi being too calm with little to no progression between episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, is this show terrible? By all means, not at all. It looks nice and sounds nicer but, does that mean just because it's the most popular means it's without it's flaws? Absolutely not. So at it's best, Kobayashi can be summed up as a cute slice of life with nice visuals. But at it's worst?\\n\\n\r\nKobayshi is the equivalent of Seinfeld if the entire show took place in Jerry's apartment.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(TEMPORARY REVIEW: This will be updated once the anime is finished)\r\nFor a while now, I believed Kyo Ani was slowly dying. A lot of mediocre and lackluster anime like Myriad Colors was coming out from the company, and many believed that Kyo Ani was a hollow shell of its former self that made classics like K-ON! or Haruhi. It goes without saying that I came in with low expectations for Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, and boy did they surprise me.\r\nKobayashi is undoubtedly one of my favorite anime from the Winter season. There's a lot of charm here, and it's really out of the ordinaryfor Kyo Ani to make an anime like this. Without further ado, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory  8 -  Mrs. Kobayashi lived a normal life. She would wake up, go to work, and then go home or occasionally get drunk. However, her life would change once she meets Tohru, a dragon that Kobayashi invited to live at her house in one of her drunken fits. Kobayashi would now begin her new lifestyle of taking care of cute, humanoid dragons.\\n\r\nThe story isn't complex, but it has a simple but charming premise, like many other Kyo Ani shows. Not a lot to say here, it's Kyo Ani.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9 - Opting for more of a chibi-like artstyle, the designs for characters look genuinely cute or well done. The clothes fit the personality of each character and their background info. I'm no art major, but there's a lot of color to show here, making the world feel alive and beautiful. Kudos to Kyo Ani, I love the art direction they took for this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10 - I simply adore the OP and ED. Aozora No Rhaspody by fhana perfectly fits the upbeat and adorable atmosphere of the show, the same with Ishuukan Communications performed by some of the cast of Kobayashi, in the typical Lantis way. Not a lot to say here, I just love it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9 - Though most of the characters fit a lot of typical anime tropes, it's genuinely hilarious seeing the characters adapt to human society, after for a long time having negative views of them. Without going in too much in detail, it's cute to see the dragons interact with society and characters in the show. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, with many great voices behind the characters. Talent like Daisuke Ono and Minami Takahashi really bring out the characters. Though I haven't seen the English dub for the show, there's great voices like Leah Clark doing VAs, so that's a plus.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 - Enjoyment is more about taste, but this show is so fun to watch. Everything works here, and it isn't annoying or dumb at times. There was a lot of care here from Kyo Ani, and it really paid off.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a must watch for this season. The charm the characters and art really blend here, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every episode that's been released by the time of this review. I hope that Kyo Ani can continue making great shows like this.",

            "content": "Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid dragon\u00a0is a series I've heard a lot about but never watched. The anime came out two years ago based off of a manga by the same writer who brought us Komori-san wa Kotowarenai. The adaptation was handled by Kyoto animation who brought us K-on, Nichijou, Hyouka & Koe no Katachi.\u00a0So, a wide array of quality there. Let's see how this one holds up.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nKobayashi lives alone, doesn't have many friends to speak of and doesn't seem to much care for her job. One day, her world opens up when she's about to leave her flat, only to find a dragon staring ather. The dragon takes on a humanoid form, thanks Kobayashi for coming to her rescue and says she's taking her up on her offer to live with her as a maid. This confuses Kobayashi as she was very drunk and doesn't recall any of that. Don't you wish that the worst thing you'd do in a drunken haze is invite a beautiful girl who adores you into your home? Instead of, say, committing arson. Just hypothetically. Shenanigans ensue as her association with Tooru brings a bunch of strange figures into her life.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the series is that some of the running gags get old quite quickly. Most notably, the stuff with Quetzalcoatl. Two of her big jokes are that she dresses inappropriately skimpily and her buxom figure creates an awkward situation for young Shouta, the fifth grade boy who thinks she's a demon as well as his familiar. The first of those might work once or twice, but gets old quickly. The second is always going to be at least a bit uncomfortable and creepy since he's a pre-pubescent boy and she's a grown ass woman. At least she doesn't go as far as the paedophile college student in Kanamemo.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of good aspects to the series as well.\u00a0 Most of the running gags are good about shifting enough to stay entertaining. The whole narrative theme of finding family and letting your chosen family enrich your life is surprisingly well handled. The ending sequence is legitimately excellent. The series is also good about addressing things like the difference in life spans between humans & dragons and using that for some tension in the narrative.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the characters are enjoyable. Fafnir living the life of a NEET while staying with a fellow nerd leads to some good situations especially when you add in his general disdain of humans. Saikawa and her obvious crush on Kanna that she has no idea how to handle leads to some good moments. Especially with Kanna being a bit more open to showing her affection. The best dynamics are among the whole \"Kobayashi family\" With Kobayashi and Tooru possessing a strong bond that can be framed in ways that are funny, adorable and heart warming. The pair of them acting as parents to Kanna works really well too.\\n\\n\r\nEven the generally weaker characters like Elma & Quetzalcoatl aka Lucoa get their moments. Elma works well when it comes to her more antagonistic dynamic with Tooru. Similarly, Lucoa is at her best when she's acting as more of a caring older sister type to Tooru and not creeping on a child.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\n*Insert obvious complaint about excessive fan-service here* To be fair, the fan-service isn't generally that bad. Most of the characters dress in pretty covering ways. The exception being Lucoa. The series also does have a beach episode because of course it does but at least it has some strong jokes. Aside from that, the character design is pretty good. The dragon elements that get kept by the characters in human form are interesting. The dragon forms, when we actually get to see them, are really well drawn. The visual gags also work well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nKyoto really cast the series well. Naganawa Maria, Kuwahara Yuuki, Tamura Mutsumi, Takada Yuuki, Katou Emiri, Ono Daisuke & Takahashi Minami all do great jobs with their performances. Itou Masumi's soundtrack is well composed and suits the series well.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot. In addition to Kobayashi & Tooru basically being a couple with an adopted child, especially as the series progresses and they get closer, there's also all of the stuff betwixt Saikawa & Kanna. Tooru also tries to bring up the time Lucoa got drunk and cavorted with her sister on a few occasions only to have Lucoa get really embarrassed and stop her. Which is accurate to the mythology, to be fair.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nAreas of Improvement:\\n\\n\r\nAge up Shouta. Having two girls at roughly the same level of development with crushes on one another is cute enough. Having two grown women starting a relationship is also well and good. Having a grown woman act seductively towards a young boy is creepy.\u00a0\\n\r\nHave Lucoa be unintentionally sexual. If Shouta were older and Lucoa was getting him going purely by accident, that would be a lot funnier than what we actually get.\u00a0\\n\r\nWork a bit more with switching up the character interactions. I'm thinking of those segments in Yuru Yuri where they put a couple characters who don't interact much together and use it to expand on those characters and throw in some unique gags for them. This series could benefit from doing something similar. Fafnir, for example, mostly interacts with Tooru and Takiya or with the others as part of a group. It might be interesting to see a segment with just him and Kobayashi.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that there were more things I enjoyed about this series than there were things I disliked and I did generally enjoy my time watching the series. If not for those issues surrounding Lucoa and Shouta I would go so far as to call this a great comedy, maybe even excellent. As is, I'll give it a 7/10. If you're looking for a really yuririffic comedic slice of life series, you'll probably enjoy this one.\u00a0",

            "content": "[7.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSo the idea for this show is kind of silly. Protagonist gets drunk, stumbles into a forest, meets a dragon and invites it to live with her in her small apartment in the city. The dragon obliges and then turns into a colorful, spunky girl in a maid outfit. It's an \"anime\" presentation through and through, from the idea to the execution. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is strange like that. A show elevated beyond all expectations by the studio working on it. Fate has a funny way of emphasizing oddities like that. \r\nI'm not sure Kyoto Animation chose this show or if it wascommissioned to create it. Regardless, KyoAni is a studio that I've grown to love without actually watching all their shows. They're this living enigma in the industry where I feel like I can see the amount of passion they have for the projects they create. I say living because they are the one studio that puts so much heart into their work, seemingly. You know that cozy diner on the corner of a street? The one that's been around for a hundred years and has the owner who says the special ingredient is \"love\"? That's Kyoto Animation in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nComing off the heels of Nichijou, one of my favorite anime I've ever seen, the only reason why Maid Dragon was a show on  my radar was because KyoAni was adapting it. What they do with this ridiculous idea is pretty staggering. Creating a pretty amazing protagonist backed up by generally likeable and entertaining side characters and some great, melancholic narrative beats that are sprinkled throughout. Maid Dragon, and I can't believe i'm saying this, is actually quite good. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is known for its visual fidelity and Maid Dragon is no different. It's one of the best looking anime out there. KyoAni doesn't ever seem to skimp out on the details, which makes their shows so endearing to watch. While so many studios try to save time by creating drawn out dialogue-driven sequences with little to no animation involved, KyoAni makes conversations feel lively, feel lived in, feel vibrant. A character making coffee is as visually impressive as anything else in the show. You never really feel like certain episodes had less effort or time put into them.\\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful watercolor background art really does give a throwback to Nichijou. It creates a homey, nostalgic atmosphere, with some beautiful line work as well as an exceptional use of soft brushstrokes for many backgrounds. The impressive art work isn't just in the backgrounds, though, as there is so many moments of awe in the foreground. We get the pleasure of seeing beautifully drawn dragons every episode, not just their human counterparts. Not a single moment was there obnoxious, glaring CG ripping you out of the scene. Instead, in true KyoAni fashion, that extra care put into drawing makes all the difference. \\n\\n\r\nThe direction is pretty impressive as well. Yasuhiro Takemoto provides much needed spark into a lot of well-worn anime tropes that are occasionally used as narrative dressing. The original presentation of a lot of these cliches makes them engaging. There are plenty of snappy visual gags to look at, as well as some heartwarming, cute moments to get fuzzy over. \\n\\n\r\nThe only negative I can point out about the presentation is that the background music is much too abrasive throughout the show. It is either too loud or too on-the-nose, making some emotional payoffs feel a little too corny and forced. Thankfully it hardly ever ruins them. The opening theme is fine. Catchy, a bit creative, but overall not too memorable. The same can be said about the closing theme, although I really do love the visuals that go along with it. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters/Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nIn Maid Dragon, the characters are somewhat hit-or-miss. And by that I mean, they are hit, hit, hit, hit, miss, miss, miss, miss. With around fifty percent of the characters being great and a pleasure to have on screen, and the other fifty percent feeling totally blank, boring, and unnecessary. Once our protagonist's dragon maid, Tohru, comes into her life, she decides to bring some friends over as well! \\n\\n\r\nAt first we get Kanna. A tiny, white-haired dragon with chubby cheeks. I kind of wanted to hate her, since there were so many people fawning over her that I really couldn't escape it. I was waiting patiently for her introduction just so I could rant about how dumb and boring she is. But around two minutes in I was already in love with how adorable, well-realized, and fun she was to have on screen. The \"new to a new world\" trope, where a character experiences every day situations in an unfamiliar way since they've never been in this world before is a guilty pleasure trope for me. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing Kanna make her away around the apartment, and eventually the school she goes to is just heartwarming and makes me want to have kids. Then you quickly realize that no kid is ever as understanding and loving as her and you fall into an emotional crisis. Wide-eyed intrigue about the norm is always a charming trope.  \\n\\n\r\nKanna eventually meets a friend at school, Saikawa, who felt more like a gag character. But appeared more than you'd think. So she had the depth of a gag character but the appearance potential of a secondary, which made for some less-than-inspired interactions later on in the show. That being said, they're relationship is generally fine. I saw there was some backlash regarding Saikawa's clearly sexual interest in Kanna, and while the corresponding scenes were a bit awkward to watch, I wouldn't say that it was overly strange for two twelve year olds to be interested in one another. Even if Kanna is technically young for a dragon, so probably a few hundred, and Saikawa is literally twelve. But, of course, judging solely on appearance. I didn't feel like the backlash here was warranted at all. Now if one of these characters was older, and drawn and acted as older, but tried to seduce and molest a young kid? Now that'd be weird and totally warranted of a backlash. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Lucoa. A mayan dragon who no longer can be a dragon due to a pretty brisk and oft-mentioned backstory. She's an older character, as in, she appears to be in her twenties. Yet she spends the majority of the show trying to seduce a young, under-aged boy. This boy, Shouta, no his name is not lost on me, is also an extremely one-note character that acts more like a gag character but is around as much as a secondary would be. Which is upsetting because he's usually paired up with Lucoa, who is just about as one-note as him. Her entire character is just that she has massive tits. Every single joke involving her is that she has big tits. That's the character. She gets virtually nothing else to work with. She's just a big titted girl that is trying to seduce a young boy, and it's weird and I disliked seeing their scenes together. \\n\\n\r\nFafnir is the only male dragon that gets extended screentime. Luckily, he's a joy to have on screen. He gets a backstory, much like every other dragon, but also a small, interesting arc regarding his relationship with humans. Every dragon has had some run-in with humans from their world that wasn't positive. So their feelings are generally negative towards humans, so in this shows good-hearted wholesome nature, they slowly grow to like humans. Some quicker than others. Fafnir ends up living with Kobayashi's work friend and they just end up playing video games together, which leads to some pretty great gags as well as an amazing reference to Dark Souls which both caught me by surprise, but also made me really love this show. \\n\\n\r\nElma gets introduced as a foil for Tohru, which Kobayashi already acted like. She's yet another one-note character that gets a semi-backstory and virtually one gimmick. But instead of having disgustingly massive meat melons, she instead just loves human food. As well as having massive tits. Which is a running gag, as the human forms these dragons take all have big tits. I have nothing to say about that. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, the characters and my interest in them is mixed. Some are great, as you actually get a feel for their personality. Others get nothing but a gimmick and a scenario to play around in. Kanna, Fafnir, and Tohru all get small, rewarding emotional conflicts that end up paying off in affecting ways. Meanwhile Lucoa and Elma get nothing to really do, and don't bring many funny gags into the show either, as their characters quickly become tedious and repetitive. Especially Lucoa, who is just completely unpleasant to have on screen. I think her design is overtly ugly, with mismatched eyes that make her look like a original character straight out of deviant art.  \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nTheir human counterparts are also hit-or-miss. But the hits are spectacular. Takiya, Kobayashi's work friend is just a great, nerdy guy. It's rare to have these kinds of characters not be over-exaggerated and annoying, which makes his presence welcome. Both Shouta and Saikawa are boring, and unfortunately really don't get much personality. Kobayashi, our protagonist, is the standout of the show. \\n\\n\r\nKobayashi's reserved, calculating personality is so well-done I actually felt like I was seeing humanity exude from her animated situation. I often have criticism towards anime for over-exaggerating characters too much for them to be relate-ably human. While that is true for most characters, in this show too, Kobayashi is a resoundingly human, grounded, and realistic person on screen. Everything from the way she speaks to the way she solves problems is very human and infinitely likeable because of that, serving as a huge juxtaposition to the other characters on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe show often ends on some emotional nuggets of wisdom, usually from Kobayashi herself. What makes these nuggets work so well is who is delivering them, a character that is purposefully not hammy and over-exaggerated. There are so many realistically sad moments that get discussed in a melancholic way that get instant emotional weight simply due to how realistic the discussion feels with Kobayashi leading it. Whether it is her discussing her drifting away from her family, to her talk on being wanted. These are brought up and reacted to so subtly and specifically not like how anime usually treats its emotional problems that the eventual emotional explosion that does occur towards the end of the show feels much more earned. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative in this show is simple, so it relies on its characters to carry it. Unfortunately, the characters are kind of a mixed bag. But seeing Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kanna all live together are the shows best moments. Seeing a familial bond and adaptation to each other is heartwarming and adorable. I completely fell head-over-heels for their dynamic together. It is so good that it makes the generally unfunny and annoying sequences with Lucoa and Shouta take a total backseat, even if they do encompass a lot of an episode. Which is what keeps this show feeling lively and constantly engaging. It isn't that it always is lively and engaging, but its that the scenes that are are so great that you forget about the more tedious aspects of that episode.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir and Takiya are also strong side-characters that help reinforce the main three characters. Having them as reoccurring characters or even taking a peak into their nerdy, hilarious hobbies is  kind of endearing. Seeing a badass dragon that could pretty much cause the apocalypse at any moment sitting around arguing with people on an MMO is inherently goofy and likeable, even if it doesn't have to be laugh-out-loud funny. \\n\\n\r\nThese are the character-driven moments which I feel rightfully excite and engage fans like myself. Not another boob-bounce sound effect or Lucoa molesting a young boy. The oddly introspective human nature of the show does wonders in juxtaposing humanity with equally human, yet perspective not human dragons. The idea that they have negative opinions of humans and why, no spoilers, is a human emotion in and of itself, which creates for all sorts of symbolically effective and cathartic character moments. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Maid Dragon deals with its interesting protagonists it constantly nails the relate-ability, humanity, melancholy, and lovingly heartwarming environment. Their oddball family is endlessly endearing. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nI'm embarrassed to admit that I went into this show cynically. The idea looked too ridiculous and it made me feel uneasy. Yet the presence of Kyoto Animation made me at least a little intrigued. The mass-praise that the show was receiving also effected my cynicism in the sense that I expected another \"Re:Zero\"-esq situation of feeling like people are overrating everything just because it has a cute character or two.\\n\\n\r\nMaid Dragon quickly won me over. Especially in its strongest moments, which surprisingly came within the first five episodes. The sexuality in the series is completely unnecessary with some characters, but the present sexual connection between Tohru and Kobayashi I do think was well done. Kobayashi doesn't have sexual feelings towards Tohru, while Tohru most definitely wants to get it on with Kobayashi. It serves as a nice comparison to Kanna and Saikawa, reversing the situation. Saikawa has an interest in Kanna, as in, a human is interested in a dragon, while Tohru, a dragon, is interested in Kobayashi, a human. Both sides have one person not necessarily reciprocating these more sexually driven feelings, but one side is human, the other is dragon. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show is at its least funny and original when it shoehorns unneeded sexuality-driven fanservice. Even having an entire character that is a boob joke, which does no favors to the series. There are also some occasionally forced abilities that these dragons seem to get just because the story demands it. For example, the ability to morph scales into swim-suits because... well, I'm not sure. They wanted to have them in cute swimsuits. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation keeps on out-doing itself, though. With gorgeous animation, line work, character art, and spectacular backgrounds. The show feels cohesive and beautiful. Leave it to KyoAni to make a show about busty dragons fucking around in the human world not be the worst thing ever. In fact, it's pretty great and memorable for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nI think i'll find myself revisiting this show at some point in the future. It's one of those series that sits at the back of your mind and marinates. Makes you think of moments and characters which you really became attached to. Whether it is Tohru's vibrant, colorful personality juxtaposing her sad past. Or Kanna's total childish perfection. Or Kobayashi's humanity. The best characters really stick with you, and I went to bed the night If finished Maid Dragon feeling surprised at how much I ended up enjoying myself.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a great example of why you should never judge a book, or in this case, a series, by its cover. On the outside it looks unbearable and exactly why anime can't be taken seriously. But when you decide to give it a shot, the standout animation, well-realized characters, and humanity-driven emotional payoff will end up surprising you.",

            "content": "Self-awareness might be the best friend of otherwise average to bad shows. The most recent example of how this works well might be Boku no Hero Academia. It doesn't promise you anything it can't deliver. And you get exactly what you were looking for, nothing more, nothing less. Sounds like a fair deal, right? With that in mind, Dragon Maid tries to do the same - this time among the vast ocean of slice of life mediocrities.\r\nMany comment on the cute girls, casual humor, light fanservice and KyoAni's visuals. But what this show actually revolves around is often missed. Kobayashi is an office lady whoused to live alone until Tohru and Kanna formed a family-like setup in her life. And that's it. How much becoming responsible for a family can change an adult? What Kobayashi's experience answers to us is that it won't change people at all. Sure, we do learn new things from raising a child, we do need to concede and make some sacrifices. That's why Kobayashi is the same person from episode one to the last. She's always the same laid-back, hard-working gal who loves a happy hour once in a while, with those dead-fish eyes to die for. And that's good enough.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the other aspects\u200b of this show are almost negligible. Side characters have any but surface-level purposes such as comic relief or fanservice. Also the setting doesn't make any difference. We could not have any dragons and it woudn't touch the purpose of the story. Having only Kanna, Kobayashi and Tohru introduced would not change the theme of the anime. What is redeeming though, is the self-awareness of this show. Whenever it takes a turn on fanservice, comedy or a heart warming moment, Dragon Maid knows what it is doing. And will be honest about it whenever possible. The best example of this is might be the \"beach episode\". It sure has a dose of fanservice, but soon we get to know a little more about Kobayashi and Tohru. The result is a heartening experience, instead of what a plain showcase of the girls' bodies would provide.\\n\\n\r\nThis is far from being a sign of recovery by KyoAni, but it's already a step ahead. As expected from them, audiovisuals are of top-tier quality. Distinctive character designs, fluid animation, gorgeous backgrounds. All in a tradicional cartoonish style, uncommon to see in anime nowadays. OST might sound repetitive many times, but this doesn't bother at all. Also unskippable opening/ending songs make it up for the experience. Voice acting is on point too, with a special spotlight on Kanna and Kobayashi's voices - They stand out above the rest in their characterizations. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes making it simple is the best. Sometimes we need a more human, light hearted story to sit and relax after a long day. It's time for the industry to try to be more honest, sensitive, and human on anime. Let's hope that KyoAni gets the message. Let's make this the starting point. And one more word: Kobayashi is the best girl.",

            "content": "I want one.\r\nWant what? A cracker?\r\nA Kanna.\r\nHuh?\r\nKobayashi-san Chi No Maid Dragon will saturate you with its moe. It\u2019ll charm or maybe even offend you with its fan service. It\u2019ll amuse you with its spontaneity. Yet none of these things are what make it special. It\u2019s about choosing your own path in life, and discovering what and for whom you should most make time for. With help from a friend, or lover or two.\r\nYoung adult nine-to-five office worker Miss Kobayashi na\u00efvely opens her apartment door one morning to find a dragon on her doorstep. After surprisingly not freaking out all that much (Kobayashi is a chillone\u2026), Tohru the dragon takes the form of a young lady and declares she wants to be Kobayashi\u2019s maid. After some initial hesitation, the introverted Kobayashi reluctantly accepts Tohru\u2019s proposal and Tohru moves on in! In this instant, Kobayashi\u2019s mundane life gains fresh purpose.\\n\\n\r\nTohru fills a void in Miss Kobayashi that she didn\u2019t know existed. Tohru bathes Kobayashi with praise and showers her with lovin\u2019. Her overwhelming affection and attention is not immediately reciprocated, but becomes increasingly appreciated by Kobayashi as she begins to warm up to Tohru and her new lifestyle. For the duo of Tohru and Kobayashi, love and care for the other party outwardly manifests itself at varied pace, exemplifying that friendships and relationships are a two-way street. At times, an emotional burden is placed on the individual who is more invested in the partnership, and at times, the other party feels guilty when they cannot reciprocate the other\u2019s strong feelings. It\u2019s an aspect of reality that Dragon-Maid does well in capturing, amongst the rest of its cast, too.\\n\\n\r\nDid I say duo? Well\u2026 because one dragon is never enough, Kanna Kamui soon joins the household and completes the trio. And my god\u2026 this young loli dragon may very well be one of the most moe female characters of ALL time! Maria Naganawa\u2019s voice acting can aptly be described as perfection, as the cute curiosity of Kanna Kamui immediately manifests itself through her playful, childlike tone. But Kanna isn\u2019t just for show! She\u2019ll surprise you with her wit and her situational awareness. She is na\u00efve yet wise, caring and honest, complete with adorable mannerisms that\u2019ll touch your heart. Want ONE reason to watch this series? Kanna Kamui. She\u2019s just that special!\\n\\n\r\nDragon-Maid is self-aware about its intensions, almost bluntly so. It\u2019s like the writer is playing with his audience. Just look at the titles of some of the episodes! Episode 2: Second Dragon, Kanna! (We\u2019re totally spoiling here). Episode 7: Summer\u2019s Staples! (The Fanservice Episode, Frankly). This unabashed nature also takes form in the portrayal of some of the show\u2019s female characters, a.k.a. the fan service, and it can serve to amuse or offend. It can elicit a chuckle by way of the writer\u2019s sheer honesty in his utilization of certain characters like the well-endowed (understatement of the century\u2026) Quetzalcoatl and the constantly under-duress young boy Shouta (fancy a guess as to why he is named Shouta?), or force an audible groan because the same formulaic sleazy \u201cgag\u201d is repeating over and over again. One thing\u2019s for sure: It brings a unique intrigue to the series. It can become a bit tiresome, but take a lighthearted approach and it may nicely \u201cround\u201d out your experience.\\n\\n\r\nSocial by nature, us humans want to feel needed, whether we realize it or not. Whether by our families, our pets, our friends, or by, perhaps ...dragons? And we want to do more than fit in with those close to us; we want to find our niche. Our purpose. Our journey began with Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kanna, and continues on with the addition of a few more cast members. As we meet the rest of the dragons, the attention-drawing Quetzalcoatl, the aloof Fafnir, the food-and-work driven Elma, they, too, embark for self-discovery and companionship in heartwarming fashion. Development among these three isn\u2019t necessarily ample, but enough attention is paid to make each of these dragons feel complete. They each embrace human nature and take in the human world in their own way, and construct meaningful lives of their own accord.\\n\\n\r\nThe Slice of Life genre is Kyoto Animation\u2019s bread and butter, and it\u2019s no surprise that the production value is high here yet again. The character designs are appealing and delve a bit into each of their personalities, from Elma\u2019s chin-covering scarf to Fafnir\u2019s calmly sinister, blood-red eyes. The fun facial expressions are both humorous and adorable. The world feels vibrant, suitably matched by its light color palate and rich, accordion-filled soundtrack. It\u2019s a nice package, if not quite a spectacle (although the OP certainly is!), and it doesn\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s a fitting canvas for the characters to live out their lives, and it suffices splendidly.\\n\\n\r\nDragon-Maid is more than it appears on the surface, it\u2019s more than Tohru\u2019s bouncing boobies in the preview, and it\u2019s something to be appreciated. It\u2019s a journey of love, and friendship, and deep, personal bonds, and community, and damn if it doesn\u2019t make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. It\u2019s about living life, and finding a companion or two who allows you to do just that to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nHeck, we could all use a little more companionship. A little more Tohru and Kanna in our lives. Kanna, especially. I loved her character... Could you tell?\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Show up for Kanna. Stay for the quirky humor, controversial fan service, and the heartwarming SOL moments. 9.0/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I like dragons, I like cute girls, and most important of all, I like good anime. Unfortunately, these three don't always mix, that is, until I came across this gem. Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid spreads its wings and soars above the rest, powered by the feeling of love and making use of beautiful aesthetics, exuberant characters, and imaginative designs to present one of the most heartwarming and memorable experiences of the genre.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid if you...\r\n-- want something that's cute as all hell\r\n-- love heartwarming, character-focused stories\r\n-- enjoy tasteful, well-executed yuri relationships\r\n-- appreciate creative, vibrant, and kinetic stylesof animation\\n\\n\r\nYou may not enjoy Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid if you...\\n\r\n-- generally avoid titles in range of Slice of Life\\n\r\n-- take up your pitchfork at the mere presence of anything \"cute\", \"moe\" or \"light-hearted\"\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is the animated adaptation of Cool-kyou Shinja's manga of the same name, published in the West under the Seven Seas banner. From what I've seen, the author is a cool dude with a fun imagination, and that bleeds out well into the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter recovering from a rough hangover, Kobayashi starts off for work and encounters what seems to be a massive dragon waiting outside her apartment. The dragon introduces herself as Tohru, claiming to have been invited over the previous night and offered to serve as Kobayashi's personal maid. The confused human initially rescinds her proposal, though seeing how much it meant to Tohru, she allows her to stay as long as the dragon promises to serve as an authentic maid. This unlikely companionship proves initially troubling for both individuals, as the otherwise reserved Kobayashi must become used to having such an energetic personality in her personal space, with the proud Tohru struggling to fit in alongside mortals she deems strikingly inferior. As time passes, more of Tohru's dragon friends arrive from their own realm, further transforming Kobayashi's otherwise quiet and mundane existence into one of excitement and fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes mostly concern themselves with the adjustments both Kobayashi and the dragons (Tohru and Kanna) must make as they come to live with one another. The supporting characters come into play at various parts, generally as a result of their own subplots or to observe the main characters' changes over time. Kanna, one of the previously mentioned friends of Tohru, is the focus of many episodes, as we observe her attending a human school or making friends with a girl named Riko. Tohru's backstory is a subplot that develops a bit of tension as time goes on, with the final episode resolving much of it in a climax of a conclusion. All in all, I was impressed to see how greatly I enjoyed each episode, not once feeling dissatisfied with the events unfolding, avoiding any sort of \"dead spots\" Slice of Life anime often experience through the course of a season.\\n\\n\r\nTo enrich the story even further, a few moments of strong thematic focus rise up to give some substance to the otherwise happy-go-lucky experience. Understanding differences and limitations, the importance of communication, the ambiguity of freedom, and coming to terms with the past are a few examples of the sort of themes you'd come to expect, allowing for some genuine moments of thought to blossom forth. While I respect Slice of Life anime for generally being \"feel-good\", it's always great to have a certain range of depth to help promote the merit of the experience, as though there might be cute girls doing cute things, these exist for more than just show.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, it seems like it's becoming harder and harder for \"Slice of Comedy\" anime to set themselves apart from each other, though I do believe Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid managed to achieve that goal thanks to its interesting lore and lively characters. A lot of the comedy spawns from the characters' interactions, with a few recurring gags utilized but never overused here and there. Honestly, humor is subjective, so it's really hard to say whether you'd like it or not without watching it, but I can say for sure I've had many, many moments of genuine smiles (and even laughter) from certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite a mostly stellar execution, the anime does succumb to some common flaws that plague the contemporary edition of the Slice of Life genre. Episodic diversity suffers a bit when you again see those familiar \"beach\", \"sports\", and \"holiday\" episodes. I had watched a fellow Winter 2017 anime in Gabriel DropOut alongside this one, and it was disappointing to see both sharing some of the same exact episodic concepts. However, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid can indeed be credited with making good use of these otherwise overused settings. For example, in regards to the aforementioned \"holiday\" episode, most of it focuses on an impromptu play the dragons must put on, and that play was easily one of the highlights of the series. Despite being faced with the problem of \"been there, done that\", the series grabbed it by the horns and showed us all that you can still find uniqueness among the conventional.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, a variety of fantasy elements serve an integral part in the story's lore (as if the \"dragon maid\" part wasn't obvious enough). The dragons arrived in the mortal realm from an mystical world of their own, one complete with exciting magic, alien foods, and foreign species. While the story largely focuses on the normal aspects of things and the dragons' attempts to understand such foreign things, the whimsical elements utilized here and there are quite nice to see. Hell, a few of the most humorous scenes involved Kobayashi struggling as both Tohru and Kanna go overboard with their superhuman abilities. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering perhaps the most important characteristic of all, the strongest feeling I think back upon in regards Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is that of pure, unadulterated love, easily the best attribute of the series. There's so much of it to go around, with a great variety of relationships involving that sort of affection you crave to see over and over. I wouldn't call the show a \"romance\" by any means, however, rather the tenderness displayed functions more as a binding function than a plot element. The love develops naturally and legitimately, never once feeling forced or artificial in nature. I'm sure anybody who watches the series would want someone to fawn over them as sincerely as Tohru does for Kobayashi.\\n\\n\r\nOn a lesser note, there is a great deal of \"eye candy\" for the audience in Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, though save for some gags associated with Lucoa, it never exists as a primary focus. Breasts and butts (and thick thighs) are all nice, and Kyoto Animation sure knows how to present them well, but for those who don't care much for anything \"fanservice\", don't worry (unless you have a no-tolerance policy, then I recommend passing).\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nIt would be futile at this point in time to award anything but praise to Kyoto Animation, undoubtedly one of the Japanese animation industry's all-time greats. Both the directors and animators are rightfully revered for producing some of the most aesthetically inventive series of the last few years, and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid could easily be viewed as another stellar mark in their catalog.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid makes heavy use of a \"storybook\" image in its artistic presentation, likely as a nod to its fantasy characteristics and otherwise imaginative foundation. Everything is full of color, often shiny, and quite vibrant in appearance. Each scene felt like a treat to my eyes as I took in the gorgeous visuals. Scenery blooms forth with a particular watercolor aesthetic, offering a unique, stylized quality that greatly enhances the artistic merit of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA few scenes in particular, such as Tohru and Kanna's friendly battle or the cast's holiday performance really stand out as exemplary works of animation, way beyond the already respectable quality of the series. Honestly, though I already view the series in high regard, you can really tell the moments when the budget was improved.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series is going for that bright, delightful aesthetic, the characters are aptly represented in their distinct yet familiar designs. I noticed particularly that each character (save for Fafnir) has a rounded, kind face that enforces that \"cutesy\" feel the anime is going for. Additionally, an overwhelming variety of expressions, both slight and exaggerated, are frequently used to present each character dynamically, allowing them to break free from the \"chains\" of being two-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid possesses a marvelous, original score that offers a fresh take on your general Slice of Life soundtrack.  There's something truly special about it, as each background theme gives off vibes that translate well into the comfortable feeling the series succeeds in promoting. In terms of sound effects, they exist in an appropriate amount, generally accompanying character actions. The only effect I can say I wasn't too impressed with was the dragon voices, but that's a minor element that's was only used during the rare moments Tohru was in her dragon form. Blame it on years of playing fantasy games, but I'm just too used to the gruff, abrasive dragon voices you come to expect.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the voice acting, I can't think of anything better to complement the brilliantly designed characters of the series than its talented cast of seiyuu. Each character, both main and supporting, perform their roles convincingly and with great emotion, personality, and enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nKanna's seiyuu in Maria Naganawa reminds me very much of Hiromi Konno (Hakase Shinonome of Nichijou), as both have proven excellent at adapting that \"little girl\" voice without being whiny or grating. Further, she really seemed to nail the perfect \"neutral\" tone, one that fits Kanna as a character well but doesn't descend into a state of monotony. I look forward to seeing her future roles, as I see a lot of promise in the young seiyuu's future.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that you're introduced to the series in quite the exciting manner. There are many things that go into a great opening, and fh\u00e1na's \"Aozora no Rhapsody\" virtually expresses each and every one of those elements in style. As a package, it does a fantastic job at weaving a creative animation sequence and an upbeat, lyrically relevant track into one pleasant introduction. It's as if Tohru were the one performing it, too, as she remarks heavily on the unlikely relationship with this one individual (Kobayashi), and how no matter what barriers exist between them, they just feel so happy together, basically the premise of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the ending, it's equally if not even more so pleasing. The whole concept of \"Ishukan Communciation\", or \"interspecies communcation\" echoes the thematic relevance presence in \"Aozora no Rhapsody\" and the series itself, yet presenting a more personal perspective as the theme is performed by the four female dragons in Tohru, Kanna, Elma, and Lucoa. Personally, it's one of my all-time favorite endings, and I'll be listening to it often as a result.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIt cannot be stressed enough that Slice of Life anime live and die by the quality of their characters, and most fortunately, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid passes this benchmark with flying colors. The main threesome of Tohru, Kanna, and Kobayashi work so well off each other, making use of great chemistry to present that realistic family feeling whenever you see them together. The supporting cast are relevant and delightful, though at times, they might only pop up to further a particular scene or gag. Having such a strong cast, both humanoid and draconic, working together to form the foundation of the series causes you to actually care about what's happening because you care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn the following few paragraphs, I'll discuss the main characters in detail, with a few words to say regarding the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nKicking off the main characters, Tohru is a dragon from her realm's Chaos Faction, notorious for encouraging the destruction of mankind and battling with divine powers. Despite expressing a general disdain for humans, viewing them as primitive, inferior beings, she idolizes her mortal counterpart in Kobayashi with the utmost reverence. She often takes offense when compared to them, stating often (with pride) that she can destroy all of mankind if she so wished. Much of the conflict of her character stems from this insecurity, as Tohru finds it increasingly difficult to \"lower herself\" to that of humanity. That being said, she will do whatever it takes to make Kobayashi happy, even if that means humiliating a proud dragon such as herself. It's precisely this authentic devotion that ends up pulling tightly at your heartstrings.\\n\\n\r\nKanna Kamui, also known by her trading card name \"Blue Eyes White Dragon\", is perhaps one of the cutest characters ever developed in an anime. Young by even dragon standards, she was expelled from her realm for playing too many pranks on the powers that be. Because of this, she comes to live with her friend Tohru and Kobayashi in the mortal realm. Kanna is often depicted with an indifferent expression, though she retains a fascination for many things, particularly insects and food.\\n\\n\r\nA touching and unexpected mother-daughter relationship grows between Kanna and Kobayashi, and the young dragon grows to develop such an affection for Kobayashi that she even assumes her surname when she becomes a student. Much like Tohru's relationship fuels the heartwarming parts, Kanna's relationship helps to supplement the adorable presentation of the series, completing the perfect familial trifecta we are privileged to experience.\\n\\n\r\nLast but certainly not least of the main three, Kobayashi-san is our familiar human being, the object of Tohru's love, maternal figure towards Kanna, and best girl (hey, even Tohru agrees!) In many ways, Kobayashi is a considerably relatable character, partially the reason why I adore her so much. As is often the case for programmers, she's noticeably reserved, not really sure at how to function among individuals (be they co-workers or dragons) who are very social by nature. Change is foreign, even uncomfortable at times, and the introduction of Tohru proves quite a shock for the young woman. She generally finds it hard to express her feelings, notably towards her companion of Tohru, and sometimes tension can arise from this. Even so, Kobayashi retains a mutual appreciation for her newfound family, grateful to Tohru for bring color to her otherwise grey life.\\n\\n\r\nLucoa, Fafnir, and Elma are the supporting cast of dragons, the former two of which are Tohru's friends from their own realm. Much like Tohru and Kanna, each character has a distinct, interesting design.\\n\\n\r\nLucoa, technically an ex-goddess, noticeably defined by her mismatching eyes, enormous bust (G's for \"goddess\"), and risqu\u00e9 clothing. While she primarily serves as eye candy for the audience, Lucoa does present herself as a supportive friend of Tohru, one of the few dragons seemingly accepting of humans and more interested than anything.\\n\\n\r\nElma is from the Order Faction, rival dragons to Tohru's Chaos Faction. Though she initially comes to the human realm to retrieve Tohru, this cute water dragon ends up enjoying the mortal delicacies of our world, taking a job at Kobayashi's technical department though having no knowledge of coding whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir, inspired by the Norse dragon of the same name, is a dark, brooding dragon, perhaps the only one of the five that detests humans more than Tohru. Despite this, and much like Elma, he finds himself addicted to another mortal creation: video games. Takiya takes in Fafnir when the latter decides to stay in the human world for awhile, and the two grow to develop a surprising friendship, as Fafnir considers the otaku \"one of the good ones\".\\n\\n\r\nRiko Saikawa, a cheerful, proud young girl, Shouta, a skittish boy wizard, and Makoto Takiya, Kobayashi's otaku co-worker, are the supporting cast of humans, with each receiving an ample amount of screen-time but less than the dragons. They all primarily play off a particular dragon in Kanna, Lucoa, and Fafnir, respectively, helping further a few subplots and gags that help supplement the series. While not as interesting as the dragons, I liked them, and never felt them being invasive or irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nAfter my thirteen episode journey alongside Kobayashi and the crew concluded, the dread of having completed such a wonderful series proved particularly painful this time. I attribute it to the connection I formed with the characters, as the genuine familial presentation seemed more like an invitation into someone's home rather than just a scripted portrayal of a writer's work. As the best of the Winter 2017 season and an all-time personal favorite series of mine, I cannot justify Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid as anything less than one of the best in its field. It understands how to do Slice of Life correctly, and serves as an unforgettable series that, despite its short length, will live on in the hearts of its fans for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nWhether we receive a new animated season or not, I know I'll be continuing to engage myself within the life of Kobayashi through the manga, keeping close watch on whether or not she'll finally give in and taste Tohru's juicy tail.\\n\\n\r\n\"I wonder what I used to be like? I've already forgotten.\" - Kobayashi",

            "content": "I heard quite a lot about Maid Dragon while it was airing, but after that time the community went quiet as new seasonal shows and their associated waifus appeared to take up everyone\u2019s time. Now, a year after its release, I finally got around to watching Maid Dragon since it seemed like a fairly laid back show and I didn\u2019t feel like something particularly difficult to follow or contemplate. I found Maid Dragon to be a pleasant surprise given that it could have been far over-hyped during its initial release.\r\nThe best part of the show is definitely the characters, with their personalities and interactions makingup the majority of the appeal rather than scenes of actions or intrigue. There have been a great many series that revolve around otherworldly beings arriving on earth and learning the customs of human society, and Maid Dragon pulls off the trope nicely, with the visiting dragons starting off misunderstanding and constantly learning, but also showing their growth as they interact with humans and learn how to live alongside them. A stated earlier, there is no single overarching plot thread, but individual encounters that showed the characters growing and better understanding their new world gave a very real sense of them living in the world, rather than using that misunderstanding to make jokes or prevent character development. \\n\\n\r\nI also would like to note the soundtrack, while not particularly standout, does contain the incredibly catchy OP that I never once skipped. The animation for this show is also slightly above the usual average for slice of life, one cour series, but given that KyoAni made this it's not too much of a surprise, though still nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for such a character-driven show, some of the side characters can feel vastly more underdeveloped than the main trio on the MAL page, used for little more than a single trait, or to fill out numbers when a group is necessary. While I like the idea that the \u201cbig warm friend group\u201d fit in well with the show\u2019s narrative, all the scenes that stuck with me fail to contain more than the main cast and perhaps one or two side characters expressing their specific trait. The appearance or prominence of certain characters also seems to sometimes be solely for the justification of other characters existing or having a place to stay on earth. As others have said, a smaller cast of more focused characters could have been beneficial to the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Maid Dragon is exactly what it says in its tags, a fantastical comedy romp through mundane life, given its charm by the main dragon leads. While not a particularly deep or thought-provoking show, Maid Dragon is just fun to watch, a relaxing way to wind down the day. I enjoyed watching at about 1 episode per day, looking forward to seeing what adventures the cast would get up to with each new episode.\\n",

            "content": "From Kyoto Animation, responsible for far too many of the slice of life shows around to possibly remember, comes the charming and wonderful Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon, an extremely charming and heartwarming slice of life show which stands atop the head of slice of life shows.\r\nOur story begins when the titular Miss Kobayashi, a programmer who loves to hang out for drinks after work, wakes up after a night of especially hard drinking. Getting ready to go back to the grind of work, she opens her door to a rather surprising sight: A giant, scale-y dragon! Utilizing shapeshifting this magnificent dragon, Tohru, declares that Kobayashitotally said she could crash at her place after saving her life last night, and that she now wishes to serve Kobayashi as a maid. Thus begins Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon, a delightful romp of the story between one middle classed Japanese office worker and her fish out of water dragon maid.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not exactly subtle with its premise and goes right for the jugular early on, with Tohru being pretty inept at the idea of modern society with a mindset more fitting a magical fantasy world, where dragons and humans are mortal enemies and the gods themselves can rain down divine punishment. Tohru herself is fittingly overpowered, with giant flaming breath, magical tricks involving dimensions that would make modern physicists spin in their graves, tearing the sky asunder to deal with a rainy day when taking out the laundry and more. Kobayashi, on the other hand, brings Tohru down to Earth and slowly gets used to actively living with another, quite odd person.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, a more diverse and fun cast join the fray, such as the WAY TOO ADORABLE Kanna Kamui, who serves as a bit of a surrogate daughter with Kobayashi and Tohru due to being banished to our dimension by her parents, the dark and chilly Fafnir, who sits on the edge of wishing to destroy the world but soon becomes distracted by the weight of MMORPGs and other games to care, and Lucoa, a goddess demoted to dragon who is just along for the fun, although she feels like one of the less fun members of the show due to being one note.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has all the laughs you would want from a slice of life show, or at least the jokes landed for me mostly, but another good technique this show works together is the ideas of tensity, developement and a nice warming of the heart. Kobayashi isn't a generic, I don't care kind of protagonist, but more as just kind of internalized her life and chugging along content enough, with hobbies that exist but do not dominate and define her life. She handles and soon compartmentalizes the changing world around her as Tohru and Kanna enter her life, which also causes her to warm up and examine parts of her own life, such as her relationship with her parents. Just how well the compartimentalization works can be seen in the ending and is done well. \\n\\n\r\nThis is contrasted with Tohru, who is impressed by the world of less danger that Earth brings compared to hers, and begins to enjoy a slower pace of life with the one she loves, as her attraction for Kobayashi is very, very real, and enjoyably is not relegated to mere subtext and is discussed at points. The tensity of how people will react to someone fairly alien if exposed forms a rather enjoyable part of the show and the show makes use of tenseness well, one of the most notable examples is in Episode 10, where the episode seems to be using tenseness and the general plot to make it seem as if it is building up to a Cringe Comedy routine, but then turning out to be something even more wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nThis series also had a lot of heartwarming moments that were really able to speak to me, especially the start of Episode 9 for example, or how comiket is handled for the cast. This is the part I can least discuss without spoilers, so I won't get into it a ton, but lets just say that lots of the characters get nice, heartwarming moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe story cannot be discussed a lot, it doesn't have a ton, especially since it is a slice of life show, but undercurrents of things like the ending are laid out through the series and some solid continuity. I give it a 6 because as far as slice of life plots go it is perfectly fine and has some nice things, but it isn't any masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStylistically, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid has some really nice animation, using some good effects when the dragons use their powers, really great character designs with things like Kanna's hair or Tohru's eyes. There's even some surprisingly well done action sequences in this slice of life show. It is somewhat basic, but definitely trying to be and does so very well. It has extremely catchy opening and endings that are incredibly cute and will get stuck in your head for far too long. It also has some good ambvient music and some really nice voice acting all along, but especially with Kanna and Kobayashi and helps make the characters leap off the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the shortform of this review? If you want a slice of life show, watch Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon. Even if you don't end up liking it, it is simply very worth forming an opinion on. If you like maids, watch this show, and be amused by Georgie and Kobayashi interacting. If you like dragons, then you'll like the parts of this show that examine the oddities of this mythological creature adjusting to a low powered world like ours. If you want lesbians and a little romance, it got some lovely bits of that. It even has some action! It will tickle your funny bone and warm your heart.",

            "content": "I took a look at this show because it had an interesting premise and seemed to be getting good ratings.  Dragons trying to coexist with humans and do slice of life stuff.  I was looking to branch out a little and perhaps see if there was something fun going on with a show that a lot of people were talking about as it was airing.  \r\nThe show had started out fairly decent if a little silly, and I was curious what they were going to try to do with the characters that they were assembling.  After watching a few shows wherethe hero gets sucked into the fantasy world, having the fantasy world come to the \"real world\" seemed like it could be pretty fun to explore.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, things didn't stay interesting for very long and I ended up very disappointed with this show to the point where I'm pretty exhausted with it after the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nBefore discussing what ultimately made me dislike the show, I will discuss the technicals.  The art was slightly below average here.  While characters were pretty colorful, there was always something a bit off with the animation and the lines that doesn't quite feel right.  It's not an incredibly well drawn show.  The sound and voice acting were average.  Nothing stood out to me as exceptional, but then, nothing was overly bad either.  My main issues were with the story and ultimately the choices made for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat had the potential to be a character study of breaking out of routine and new ways of looking at things quite quickly devolved into lazy writing of repetitive jokes and fan service of questionable taste and appropriateness.  While there is nothing wrong with fan service, there is a point where it can't substitute for writing decent characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are a salary woman and her dragon maid.  They have their quirks and their interaction looked to set the stage for an interesting slice of life, learning a new world dynamic.  I was actually pretty intrigued the first few episodes as they were interacting.  \\n\\n\r\nI actually started liking the show less and less the more characters were being introduced.  While one would think that adding new dragons and friends around the neighborhood would add interesting interactions, all too often the writers took the cheap and easy way out of making characters very one dimensional and repeating the same jokes over and over and over again.  \\n\\n\r\nOne major issue comes with the younger dragon who comes to live with them.  What at first seemed like it would be interesting, as these dragons are very old compared to the humans, quickly turned into a relationship with one of her school mates where this dragon in a little girls body does something lewd and her school friend provides an inappropriate surrogate nose bleeding reaction to her.  This becomes a running gag in the show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue comes when a different dragon appears and becomes a guardian of sorts for a little boy.  The running gag with these two is that the dragon is an incredibly buxom sexpot who has no issues at all being naked or shoving this little boy in her cleavage complete with bouncy noises while he acts horrified.  While this could be funny if it happened once as part of a \"cultural misunderstanding\", it essentially becomes their whole relationship schtick and the basic gag anytime they show up in the story.  It wasn't funny enough to carry the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on about a few other characters but they are similar in that they are one trick gags that get rotated in every so often as the show goes along.\\n\\n\r\nWith characters like this, the show's humor end up feeling very repetitive and one ends up feeling a bit creeped out after watching these things over and over.  Or not, depending on what you're in to, but that was my reaction.  The characters do engage in a variety of activities, but instead of writing new humor, you get the a twist on the same boob jokes or whatever the character joke is over and over in a new environment.  \\n\\n\r\nThe longer the show went on, the more I felt like I knew pretty much how each story was going to play out, and it really wasn't very funny or interesting anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThere are better ways to do fish out of water shows like this.  This ultimately felt like a quickly produced cheap show to me, and in the end, a bit of an insult to my intelligence.  Granted, I didn't go in expecting a lot here, I was actually looking for a light entertainment show to balance out the deeper stuff I was watching, but still, this ended up being pretty repetitive and way too focused on bizarre attempts at fan service that just felt creepy.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really recommend this show when there are far better options available.  There are more interesting examples of shows where humans and other creatures get along, and there are better shows for fan service as well that actually have a more interesting story.  I would seek those out and only waste time here if you absolutely have to see what people are making memes about.\\n\\n",

Dragons that try to enslave humanity and bring forth destruction?? \r\nBut wait.. this series seems to have another purpose...and what is that?\\n\r\nDragons coming into moe culture and becoming waifu material?

Well... what a time to be alive. \\n\\n\r\nThough this show was just another series that's full of cute girls just like most of KyoAni's productions, I might have enjoyed it along with the genre it offers, the slice of life.

            "content": "This anime is so pure... I had to watch it thrice...\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is purely great from it's standard point of plot and it's slice-of-life quirkiness to its characters. It's fun, not too shallow nor dull, but happiness with living color nonetheless.\r\nEven though the story is quite odd from the beginning \u2014 where it tells a story of a living, breathing dragon that has the size of Kobayashi-san's apartment, that brings nothing but destruction and chaos, came to her apartment, hiring herself as a maid and has mad feelings to a human from the present day \u2014 the comedic approach and the runninggags and random situations really stands up from all of it with a right amount of RomCom, fan service and story development.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that criticizes me is the last episode of the story. Sure, the ending is a good thing to wrap up this anime, but tends to leave a lot of unanswerable questions that put everyone in a cliffhanger... unless you read the manga, then you're the special snowflake in the room.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the art... of course it was made by none other than Kyoto Animation. So, it kinda surprises me a little bit though. I kind of or not kind of expected that Kyoto made this because the it reminds me of Nichijou because of somewhat similar art style. So there's that. (Anyways, WHERE'S NICHIJOU SEASON 2, GODDAMNIT!!)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is really great honestly. But the only sound I would like to hear is Kamui's voice... especially when she hums like a cute vanilla ice cream with cherry on top. Especially when she moans, I really, REALLY like to.. ohh shit, the FBI suddenly came into my room and he's about to smash me to the keyboa- aiohiahdfa; fphoa'hc'p hefajopdjoapjd'[pAJo...\\n\\n\r\nBut no, seriously, the voice actors and actress were great. The OP is catchy... but the ED is kinda on-par. Maybe it's cringey or it's just me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters performed here are great. Memorable, rather. And they are actually adorable, honestly. I found Kobayashi-san cute honestly, and she kinda reminds me and also to everyone who are working in a unfriendly and toxic environment that drastically change her personality. To me, she's realistically as she gets to a real-life worker and keep on struggling just for a living and hanging on to an environment she usually doesn't like to work there. But she had a good and wacky relationship to Touru and the rest to keep her self more motivated and learn something more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, everything surrounds Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is truly one of the best Slice of Life animes yet. Maybe a slight homage to the wacky world of Nichijou, which is another Kyoto Animation anime, and it's truly fun to watch. I have no words to describe as how charming this anime to me... So, just go and watch it!",

The characters get introduced and build up bonds with one another, before a roadblock appears to them at the climax. It is nothing out of the ordinary, yet due to the mostly adorable/easy-going/overall warm atmosphere brought upon by the characters it still makes out to be a rathercaptivating story.\\n\\n\r\nStill, many points will be given for the friendship between the 2 male characters, cute design, lighthearted Tohru and overall warm humour.

            "content": "I can\u2019t decide whether Kobayashi is Best Mom or Best Dad.\r\nStory:\r\nA woman named Kobayashi, who has a maid fetish, stumbles upon a dragon while drunk, saves her life, has some more alcohol and does some drunken ranting. The very next day said dragon rings her bell and introduces herself as Kobayashi\u2019s new personal maid. Hilarity ensues. Later on, other dragons join in on the fun as well. Kobayashi\u2019s Maid Dragon (or Dragon Maid) is a funny fish out of water-comedy, but only partially. The dragons are also rather silly in general, like Tohru\u2019s obsession with Kobayashi, Fafnir\u2019s obsession with online gaming or Quezt\u2026Quest\u2026Qes\u2026Lucoa\u2019s obsession withlittle boys (let\u2019s keep it at that). All the interactions and situations are pretty funny to me, even though some of the jokes are rather old, the presentation still makes them at least charming. Speaking of charming, that\u2019s another big plus of this show, but I\u2019ll get to that in more detail later, when we get to the characters. It\u2019s surprisingly heartwarming and cute for what is supposed to be a silly comedy and that\u2019s exactly what makes it better than many other comedy anime for me. If KonoSuba is a masterfully executed mean-spirited comedy, Kobayashi is on the other end of the spectrum, kind of the Full House to KonoSuba\u2019s Married with Children\u2026only funny.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe character design might be eerily familiar to you if you have seen \u201cI can\u2019t understand what my husband is saying\u201d. That\u2019s because Kobayashi has the same creator. I like this design, it works perfectly for a comedy. However, due to this anime having full half hour episodes instead of them being shorts like most of his (her?) other works, there was a lot more effort put into most of the cast, especially the dragons. I love their eye design, especially Que\u2026Lucoa\u2019s. The fact that they also all have enormous boobs is probably a personal fetish of the creator, but it doesn\u2019t hurt the cutesiness of the show at all (I also like boobs). The world of Kobayashi is very colorful and warm, which again works well with the tone of the series. Little special effects were needed, but they looked really, really good when they appeared on screen. As far as I heard, the dragons in their dragon forms were drawn by hand. If that is indeed true, that\u2019s impressive. In the end, the whole art style is still a matter of taste, but whether you like it or not (and I do), it\u2019s well done.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme is very, very catchy, which is always a good thing. The ending is just as memorable, as is the background music in general. I usually don\u2019t remember much of a soundtrack after watching an anime, especially when it comes to laid back shows like Kobayashi is. This time however, I still fondly remember that one accordion track that played during the short skits with Tohru burning down the episode title and in multiple scenes of the show as well. The voice acting was well done, everybody sounds like they should in my eyes\u2026I mean, ears. I especially liked Kobayashi\u2019s drunken tomboy voice and Emiri Katou as Saikawa, but they all did a good job.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nInstead of the individual characters, let\u2019s take a look at the cast as a whole first. As mentioned earlier, Kobayashi is not only a very funny show, it is also full of heartwarming moments. The three members of the Kobayashi household (Tohru, Kanna and Miss Kobayashi herself) make up a happy little family, who care for and love each other very much. Sure, Tohru\u2019s sexual attraction to her mistress is mostly played for laughs, but they really like each other and the jokes never really get mean. Kobayashi and Kanna end up becoming like mother and daughter with some of the most teeth-melting scenes I\u2019ve ever witnessed. For example (and this may be considered a major spoiler for some of you, so, yeah, be warned I guess) when Kobayashi works overtime to get a day off for Kanna\u2019s sports festival in school or when Kanna puts back the little pendant she wanted because she realized how expensive her school stuff is, only for Kobayashi to buy it anyway as a surprise gift. But it\u2019s not only the big, touching scenes, it\u2019s also in the little ones, like when Kobayashi praised her for using a figure of speech she learned in school (while two dragons are about to kill each other in her living room no less!). Kobayashi and Tohru also have their moments, most notably when Tohru keeps wearing the scarf she got for Christmas (no matter the temperature) or when they met for the first time, where it was Kobayashi who wanted to become friends. Tohru and Kanna have less obvious scenes, but one can see how good their relationship is when they play together for example.\\n\r\nAnother strong point of the show is the character development. Often enough, we have slice of life anime where characters never change, never grow and never develop. Here however, we do, even if it may take a second look to notice. Kobayashi slowly grows into her new role as the \u201cworking Dad\u201d of a family of three, Tohru gets less frightened about the potential threat she sees humanity as, Elma learns that there is more to this world than just black and white and Fafnir no longer wants to eliminate all the humans (only most of them). To be fair, not everybody gets such a development. Kanna is a ridiculously cute child, but that fact never changes or anything. Quite the opposite, she seems to have become more childish as the show goes on, trying to live the childhood she may never have had (after all, she\u2019s hundreds of years old). But even the characters who don\u2019t develop much are at least likeable. Qwerty\u2026Lucoa may be a pedophile, but she honestly likes the little Shouta and is shown helping him with his studies, or tries to. She gets a lot of flak for being a one gag-girl, which is true, but she still is a well-meaning woman, so I can\u2019t bring myself to hate her. Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Saikawa, the loli-loving loli. She is introduced as the alpha bitch of her class, but as soon as she makes Kanna cry, she drops the whole fa\u00e7ade and becomes her friend instead (with an unhealthy fixiation on touching her(while Kanna seems to still be in her oral phase(Note: Freud is considered bullshit by most scientists(Note to self: use less parentheses))). That\u2019s about it for the cast, except for some minor characters who get next to no screen time. In conclusion, we have many likeable people who care for each other and who undergo character development for the most part.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you made it this far, you may have noticed that I greatly enjoyed watching this anime. I think I explained myself with the previous four paragraphs, so I shall not repeat myself here. Is this a show for YOU? That, only you can really decide. Written words can\u2019t explain a comedy very well, so I\u2019d say give it a shot and see for yourself. Maybe you even end up finding some hidden depths within Quetzalcoatl\u2026Lucoa that us plebs have failed to see. If nothing else, you can still enjoy the diabetes that is the Kobayashi \u201cfamily\u201d. If you indeed want my two cents stripped down to one sentence, be my guest: I loved it and I want to see more of it, like, right now.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.2/10",

            "content": "So, what do you get when you mix a Maid and a Dragon together? I guess we get an anime like this. I do have to admit, I did not have high hopes for this anime when I saw very large titted maids who were supposed to be dragons. I was about ready for it to be overly fan service with not much story. I was slightly right, but the story I got actually was a really cute one. It\u2019s much more of a slice of life with the dragons trying to interpret our human ways.\r\nOur main character is Kobayashi, a human woman who workshard and is a bit antisocial. After a very annoying day at work, she got drunk and went to the mountains, running into an injured dragon named Tohru. After helping her, she ends up getting Tohru to become a maid and live with her in her house. Cue hilarious antics vive slice of life misunderstandings and Yuri crushes. Ya, did I mention that Tohru has this very deep crush on Kobayashi for some reason and wants her to feel the same? The show reminds me of \u2018Is This a Zombie?\u2019 where they mixed aspects that they pulled from a hat. It\u2019s not a bad way, but it\u2019s in an odd way. I think the problem with these types of shows is the fact that it\u2019s rather new. It takes aspects of things that we think won\u2019t work together and seems to mash them together. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, sometimes it does. I give props for them trying though.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the characters. Kobayashi is a rather generic character. She is a typical Japanese salary woman who doesn\u2019t get out much. The only thing that makes her stand out a bit is the fact that she is crazy about maids. Not the typical maids that we see in maid cafe's and social media, she loves the real deal. Even though she is very generic, I consider her like the straight man in a comedy act that her life has become. \\n\\n\r\nTohru on the other hand is the comedy part of the group, much like all the dragons are I feel. The misunderstandings are what fuels the comedy and I do have to say it\u2019s done rather cute (when Quetzalcoatl isn\u2019t around). They never tried to make Tohru to sexy even with the large breasts she had nor any other of the dragons (again, besides Quetzalcoatl) so it keeps the show rather innocent. Tohru herself is a very loving and dedicated person with a friendly personality that people seem to be drawn to. If Kobayashi was Yang, Tohru would probably be her Yin. Those opposites just work very well together. I do question one thing though, why does she want to make Kobayashi eat her tail? It probably explains in the manga but I haven\u2019t read that yet. I do wish the anime would explain it.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character I would love to talk about is Kanna Kamui. She kind of acts like the child of Kobayashi and Tohru in a way which makes for some really cute family time with the three of them. Kanna is the very image of innocence, and this is mostly because she truly is a child. The problem I had with her was that she didn\u2019t seem to act like a real innocent child in the beginning, calling Kobayashi a slut for taking Tohru away. It didn\u2019t take very long though for her to end up calming down and acting as a normal child (as far as dragons go).\\n\\n\r\nWhile I said the dragons were rather cute and innocent, there is one exception. Quetzalcoatl is the fan service of this anime with her even larger breasts and scantly dressed outfits. No wonder there is a gag talking about her being a succubus and always getting in trouble for her choice in clothing. I was very happy that they didn\u2019t make her a main character and only a supporting character as I wasn\u2019t bombarded with her breasts in my face most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nice, although standard. I think the interesting thing is that Kobayashi was made to look like a guy. She wasn\u2019t given the large breasts, beautiful big eyes, or even the figure of a girl. She was given what Tohru calls \u2018dead fish eyes\u2019 where the pupil of her eyes is really tiny. The only time she really looks like a girl and not a girlish boy is when her hair is down which seems to only be in the bath or sleeping. The colors do fit the mood very well, pastel when it\u2019s a very gentle and heartwarming time, to very bright when there is a lot of energy going on. \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub isn\u2019t bad, I would consider it average for what Funimation does. It\u2019s hard to get excited for dubs now when they are as nice quality as what Funimation kicks out. Kobayashi is voiced by Leah Clark who did a couple voices in other shows I have watched like Minami from \u2018Baka to Test\u2019, the fictional voice of Eucliwood Hellscythe in \u2018Is this a Zombie?\u2019, and Fuyuki from \u2018St. Frog\u2019 (yes, she played the boy) but her voice just never seemed to actually stand out to me the way she voices Kobayashi it seems. There is something about how she can give a rather plain character a bit lovable. It was also the same when she played Jiji from \u2018Princess Jellyfish\u2019, the character grows on you the more you see her and so does the voice. I also have to give props to Jad Saxton who did the voice of Kanna Kamui because she captured the really cute character well, and also to Garret Storms who did Fafnir really well. I have to add Garret Storms to my list of awesomely sexy deep voices along side Michael J Tatum. Not bad for someone who seems rather new to the scene of voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nSo now we come to the question on what I thought of this show. It actually grew on me. I liked the cute little slice of life that it had as much as I liked \u2018The Devil is a Part-Timer\u2019 which is another anime that this reminded me of. I got into the characters a little bit as well with how interesting there view of the human world was. It\u2019s definitely a alright anime if your interested in looking it up, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a most see.",

            "content": "Alright, this is my first review so please bear with me on this.\r\nI had recently finished watching the final episode of Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon. How was it?\r\nWell, it was alright I guess.\r\nYes, it's one of those everyone loves that I'm not too fond of.\r\nI will do my best not to note spoilers.\r\nLet's start with the story:\r\nIt's about a woman and a dragon girl. Simple stuff. It's basic slice of life stuff, generic at it's finest. It's themes of relationships and family are prevalent throughout the entire series. Not to mention, it also has a touch of fantasy.\r\nI thought it was alright, but theentire structure has been seen in numerous anime previously, which is why I gave it a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I actually like the art style. It's simplistically adorable and appealing. The colour palette pops out like cherry blossoms on a rainy day. Just your average moe Slice of Life art style. But I'm giving it an 8 because I actually like the art style, but it's more of my thing and I don't really speak for others.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm no sound technician, and it wouldn't be fair to write a review for the sound if I don't really know how to describe it. \\n\r\nAll I can say is that the background music is fitting for different situations and the theme tune is super catchy!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where all the problems come flowing in.\\n\r\nThe characters are either bland or serve no other purpose than to be pedophile fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi is your Average Jane with a job. She is one of the relatable characters, like many other protagonists. As she is the titular character, you'd expect her to serve a lot of purpose to the plot. She is actually rather likeable. She's an otaku, she drinks beer and is a tomboy. But alas, her personality is... bland? Still likeable, but, eh.\\n\\n\r\nTohru is my favourite character because she actually has character. She's energetic, she'll do anything for Kobayashi and has emotions. Could I ask for a more bubbly character bubbly character in the show? To be fair, I kinda laughed whenever she flew Kobayashi over the city due to her humongous size in dragon form. \\n\\n\r\nKanna... as adorable as she is, a lot of situations she's in with her classmate Riko are... fanservicey...? I mean.... Kanna is supposed to be in Kingergarten or Elementary...? She's an emotionless (or kuudere) little girl who quickly becomes accustomed to Kobayashi. The only things I like about her is her outfit and the fact that she'll pretty much eat anything that moves.\\n\\n\r\nLucoa. LUCOA. I have nothing nice or positive to say about Lucoa. She's basically your local neighbourhood pedophile who was summoned by a 9 year old boy (whose name is a pun on \"Shota(con)\" who in return gets sexually harassed and abused by Lucoa. Her entire character is pretty much there for pedophile fanservice. I feel like her entire character is one massive disgrace to the actual Quetzalcoatl. Massive negative -10 to her. Maybe I'm just being a moral party pooper but... yeah.\\n\\n\r\nElma is an office lady dragon. As she had only appeared late into the series, I won't say much but... she's bland as bread.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the characters as a whole a 5.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLet's just say that... without all the noncey stuff in it, it would be a lot better series. Every time I thing of the twister scene with Riko and Kanna and pretty much every scene with Lucoa and Shouta, I feel like I need to run into the nearest church building, and I feel like running into the screen and dragging the poor boy away from the Ick. The blatant in-your-face pedophilia is pretty much rife in this show. I have always been uncomfortable with this theme in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI liked all the fantasy aesthetics in the show, and sadly, it wasn't really prevalent as the nonce fanservice. I'd love to see more of the fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon is nothing more than a harem anime with a pedophile fanservice theme. I'm only giving it a 6 because I enjoy the art style and the entirety of Tohru's character. I think I'd give it a higher score if it wasn't so rampant on it's fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Probably? Maybe. It's up to you to decide on how you see the show.",

            "content": "If there's one thing the winter season will be remembered fondly for, it'll be the solid moe slice of life anime that came out during that time. For people like me, who enjoy shows like that a lot, it was a rather fun couple of months. Wide variety of SOL proved to be very accessible even to the people who aren't particularly into anime like that. But even before the season, there was one specific show that thousands of fans were really excited about: the new project by Kyoto Animation - Kobayashi-san's Dragon Maid. With some solid, well established name behind the project and aweird name, it's definitely a show that could capture your eye while browsing through the list of winter shows. How was it then? Well, let's start from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers included*\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi wakes up hungover, takes her stomach medicine and gets ready for work. She's just a normal person in a boring world. However, the moment she opens her doors, a giant, green scaled beast pops in front of her face and lets out an almighty roar. The terrified Kobayashi stays in place as some kind of an incantation circle appears before her eyes, and as the bright light blinds her, she looks into it. What comes out.... \\n\r\nWait, is that... \\n\r\nIs that a maid? WITH A DRAGON TAIL AND HORNS? \\n\r\nThat's right ladies and gentlemen, Tohru is a dragon, who escaped her fantasy world after a battle, and after meeting Kobayashi, who offered her to stay at her place in her drunken rant, decided to live alongside humanity. Why? Because she fell in love with that crazy drunk. And so begins the tale of understanding different cultures, love, fun, and an entirely new anime loli dragon fetish. Actually, forget the last one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off rather innocently and weirdly uneventful for something sounding so crazy. I saw very little promising features in it. There were fanservice moments, rather pushy humor and the characters felt off-putting, especially Kobayashi's wild, drunken behavior as she stripped Tohru down. Thankfully, that quickly changes with the introduction of additional characters, the first one being Kanna, a little kid that wandered into the human world in search of Tohru. After that, more and more people decide to hop onto this new \"go into the human world\" train and soon we got ourselves quite a bunch of misfits that absolutely doesn't fit the world of a simple worker that Kobayashi is. \\n\\n\r\nActually, this is one of the most interesting themes of winter - the dragons getting used to living by a completely new set of rules. It isn't handled as if they were completely unknowledgeable about humans, they had those in their world too. They were the equivalent of our fantasy knights, but still. Dragons have a somewhat coherent image of what a human is to them, but it's actually different than ours. Both Tohru and Kanna see them as enemies, a brutal bunch that, as inferior as they are, put up an unnecessary fight and threaten their existence. The development from this point of view goes a long way. All of them, from the ones with an aggressive stance to the ones that simply don't care, start to understand and respect humanity for what it is. They start to see it as a big, coherent, happy family, something that they could never really find in their world. Same goes for the humans. All the people that the dragons get close to start off being fascinated by them, but by the end they befriend those that they considered to be almighty monsters at first.\\n\r\nBut, despite trying, those two worlds can't understand each other completely. That's not a bad thing though. They accept each other and find happiness in those differences, Kobayashi has much more fun than she ever had, Tohru can spend time with someone she loves, Kanna can learn and grow alongside those who are more experienced, both in human and dragon things. This peaceful correlation, tranquility amongst the craziness of completely new elements being added to one's viewpoint on the world are especially heartwarming. On top of that it sets up a great foundation for the individual character development that this show visibly aimed for from the very beginning, especially when it comes to the main duo.\\n\\n\r\nTohru and Kobayashi live in a rather peculiar relationship. One's clearly in love with the other, but she finds it hard to really get into a serious relationship. Tohru acts a bit too immaturely by our standards, it's difficult for Kobayashi to take her words for granted, but the more time they spend together, the more they can really understand what this way of life they're set on means and what could it bring. Problems arise often. Tohru tends to get jealous, not understanding the meaning of pure friendship, acts irrationally and impulsively. All she wants is attention. She wants to feel the love she felt while meeting her and being invited to live with Kobayashi. On the other hand, she also fails to understand that her love interest is just as much in the dark as she is. Kobayashi lived alone for a longer while now, she never got into a relationship like that before. she can see how hard Tohru is trying, but it's hard for her to change her approach on a whim like that, especially with her heavy work schedule and the sudden appearance of this new challenge. Their relationship is the core of the show, something that seamlessly changes on the inside, for example, with the way both of them approach their daily activities in new ways, such as Tohru's responsibilities becoming more diverse, indicating the increasing reliance Kobayashi places on her. On the outside though, this isn't such a common occurrence. There's very few serious dialogues between them, but when they occur, they move their view of one another heavily, like when Kobayashi uncovered her social troubles to Tohru, she accepted them and stopped becoming as pushy with her attempts to get as close as possible in as little amount of time as possible. Things progressed naturally from there on out, they even started to cuddle when sitting at a kotatsu, their dialogues started being even more casual, so they actually started to feel like a couple in a way. It's barely noticeable because of how charismatic and loud this show is at all times, but it's a very important part of this show's writing, and it really says a lot about its masterful scripting.\\n\r\nSo as they start to joke around more and more, Kobayashi slowly warms up and changes her attitude, Tohru becomes more reliable and accustomed to the human world and their ethics, we can truly see how important their relationship really is to both of them. Kobayashi can finally find comfort with the place she's at in life, she can rest and have fun by simply being at home, which she talks about numerous times with appreciation, and same goes for Tohru, who, while living in her own world, had to constantly escape from dangers and had her fate decided by her father, or properly enjoy the time she has in between getting thrown around by fate and other people. While both still can't accept each other fully, Kobayashi and Tohru can live together and have a blast while doing so. This way both of them can decide on who they are to themselves and to each other. You simply can't take something like this for granted, not a lot of shows can create such an intricate relationship between the two characters that get so much screen time. But Tohru isn't the only one that changes people's lives. Let's move on to the rest of the dragons.\\n\\n\r\nKanna also becomes a huge influence on Kobayashi. To me she feels like an adopted child. The way she has to get accustomed to talk with another kids, starts going to school and deal with everyday activities accompanying it (dealing with bullies, sport festival and making friends), how she shines so brightly when she receives the tiniest bit of confirmation of love from Kobayashi, who is her guardian. Once again, it feels like she didn't get those type of things in the other world, just like an adopted child wouldn't get in an orphanage.\\n\r\nAs such, she becomes a serious responsibility for Kobayashi, unlike Tohru, who would mostly end up being someone helpful by cleaning and doing fun things. Kanna needs more attention, she needs to grow, find interests, feel the love from her parent, be fed properly, discover new things, just like every child does. This is especially visible in the sports festival episode, where Kobayashi has to work overtime to be able to attend something important to Kanna. It's pretty much a symbol of her leaving her past life behind, but it resonates so strongly because she does it for another person, she dedicates herself to someone else which was unheard of when she lived by herself. Small steps, sure, but this paves the way for her to accept Tohru later on and become a reliable person, so as you can see, no interaction is unimportant here. Not only that, but because Kanna, Kobayashi and Tohru live in such a close relationship, they influence one another through chain reactions. This on the other hand can be noticed in the last episode, when Tohru disappears. Kobayashi and Kanna pretty much stop in their tracks and even start regressing, as more responsibilities fall on her, we realize that despite her growing ability to take on responsibilities, she isn't fully ready to do continue her new way of life by herself, and as such, Kanna also becomes less active and more silent, regressing as well.\\n\r\nOthers begin to rely on humans as well, more so than they could probably imagine. Even a dragon like Fafnir, who resented humanity above all else and considers them inferior, has to eventually acknowledge the fact that amongst them there are those who he could consider \"hits\", even if most of them are \"misses\". But it's not like the humans don't see anything that's going on. Takiya hangs out with Fafnir and plays games with him (some include Dark Souls, Mario Kart, and anime MMOs. They don't name them, but there is an entire Dark Souls sequence in one episode. This show is great at including references). By allowing Fafnir to live with him, treating him as if he would treat any other human and being open to creating a bond, you can come to a conclusion that he wants to help the dragons as well, just like Kobayashi did. Also, Shouta comes to the point where he feels lost and sad when Lucoa isn't with him. Their relationship is much less important in the long run, but this is an example of a certain change. The two worlds, the human one and the dragon one, are like  two  layers, but instead of one overtaking the other, they end up mixing and continuing to grow. They live in a symbiotic relationship, they can improve one another by simply coexisting, and it's as wonderful as the examples of such relationships that you can see in nature. An improbable encounters between species that don't need each other, but can willingly work together to take some responsibilities off of each other if given a chance (of course only considering the mutualistic ones). It's easily one the most heartwarming natural occurrences, and it's just as adorable in this show, if not more with the added musical and visual side.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the audiovisual side, Kobayashi is definitely a stand out. It has a rather unique style of being an actual \"moeblob\" in terms of character design, with a lot of round faces and lack of mouths at specific shots, but that simply adds to the charm. It uses a wide color pallet, the backgrounds look like paintings and the animation is great. KyoAni quality right here. The sound ranges from happy, cheerful and exciting to deep and thoughtful, complementing the switches in tone. It really helps getting in the mood, so the transitioning won't feel sudden. \\n\\n\r\nI also really want to address the issue that some in the community expressed, that being the accusation of pedophilic intent of some of the scenes where Lucoa pushed Shouta to touching or seeing her breasts, or Kanna (who is actually thousands years old) jumps on top of her friend saying that she wants to get to know her. I thought about it a lot, trust me I did, and I came to a conclusion that while I can't exactly retort those claims, I want people to look at it from a different angle. I absolutely reject the thought that a show that showed me such a beautiful homosexual relationship, a very subtle look at parenting from many different angles and an in-depth look at the understanding and living alongside different types of cultures would just simply show pedophilic content with any sort of evil intent. I know that it's sort of there, and that someone may take it as such, but if you look at how many great lessons and wonderful messages this show sends, I see no reason for it to be considered evil. KyoAni still has a lot to learn in terms of fanservice, which they showed both in Phantom World and Dragon Maid, I'm willing to give them a chance to grow. This show is all about connection, I don't want it to split people because of a couple of scenes. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm very glad that I gave this show a chance. As should you. This show is a great, fun ride that anyone can enjoy if they are willing to do so. It's heartwarming, pretty, deep, thoughtful, happy or exciting when it needs to. It truly owned the subtlety that it needed, so it could be such a memorable experience. Deep down inside, I know this show will remain in my mind for a long time. It helped me to develop my own views on topics that I haven't thought about before by showcasing different sides of one problem. Do yourself a favor, and try watching Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon if you feel like watching a solid slice of life. Maybe you'll see even more than I did. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I highly recommend you to develop you own.",

            "content": "My first instinct was to call Maidragon \"offensively bad\", but it's much more of a \"mindnumbingly bad\"-type of anime. There's nothing there. Watching it is no different than staring at a blank screen for twenty minutes; you get the same boring effect and feeling that you've wasted some, if not all, of your time. \r\nLet me set aside all of my moral issues with the show, because if they haven't bugged you already, you likely don't care. I also don't wish to offend fans of the show when I say that I simply don't get it. Even after giving it a shot, I have noclue why this anime is so popular in both the West and Japan (though Kemono Friends beats it out in the latter area). Anyway, let's move on. \\n\\n\r\nMaidragon focuses on the comedic mishaps of a group of dragon girls when they find their way to an ordinary woman's apartment. It's presented in a series of sketches which all rely on the viewer to elicit at least one of two reactions: 'this is funny' or 'this is cute'. If you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of not experiencing them, everything falls apart pretty quickly. You start finding plotholes that haven't been addressed and likely never will be: Why would an adult woman let all of these people into her house, especially so quickly, and then get a new apartment just for them? Why isn't anyone suspicious of the numerous people, some of them children, that suddenly appeared in her home? Why are the dragons magical? There's no interest in answering such questions, only finding ways to brush them off with a one-liner or some other sort of joke. Sure, you aren't supposed to pay that much attention to the details, but where is the base of the material? Why should you care, other than through two of the most basic methods of emotional manipulation? You shouldn't. It needs you to be non-inquisitive and readily consumerist to enjoy what little is laid out. It's OK if that much works for you, but it's not quite enough to satisfy me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's likely worth noting is the relentless amount of Shoujo-Ai in the series. There is some vaguely sexual thing between women that happens or is hinted towards at least once every five minutes. As a lesbian myself, I normally wouldn't mind, but this element feels awfully shoehorned in and designed to pander to the (predominately male) otaku audience of the show\u2014like mass-produced lesbian pornography, its existence doesn't do much other than serving an extremely basic 'girls are hot' point of view. If I were still 12, maybe it would seem more realistic or more compatible with my point of view. To pretend that it's some sort of feminist, pro-LGBTQ statement is to ignore literally every other theme within the show itself to reinforce your own beliefs. And that's a story for another post.\\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the entire show. I don't think its art or music are worth mentioning (depressingly unusual for a KyoAni show), so there's no point in devoting paragraphs to what I can say nothing about. Regardless, if you're looking for something basic and cute and are less picky about what you watch, it might be for you. Want a bit more to think about or care too much about slice of life shows? Here may not be the best place to start.",

It's endearing and enjoyable to watch Tohru adapt to living on earth. The show can be also be suprisingly poignant especially when Tohru has to deal with the possibility of out living Kobayashi. The dragons' back stories are fascinating and I wish I could get more world building. The dragon characters are so damn likeable that I want to know more about their long and complex histories.All in all the show is a great slice of life story with a lot of warmth and heart.",

Do they really contain more than just activities described as being unexciting? Well, how about we take that exact question and spice it up with a bit of fantasy and imaginative writing? The result? Say hello to the wonderful slice-of-life anime titled Maid Dragon!\r\nDragons in a human world. They're powerful, quirky, quite bouncy indeed, and one apparently wears a maid outfit. In the eyes of programmer Kobayashi and ours as well, you can say the ordinary is becoming rather extraordinary... and quickly too! Now, a combination ofoddness and conventionality might be a bizarre thing. But here's where I tell you how this show has succeeded in putting a refreshing twist to the slice-of-life genre. At first glance, it's only a fuzzy and cute display. True, however, there's more to this than just heart-tugging sweetness. These dragons, who have little knowledge about humans, are given the chance to experience the goodness of human nature by meshing with the world of people. Pretty much everything in an everyday life. From what we do, how we communicate, what we enjoy, and how we bond. In their eyes, they are shown all these ordinary circumstances that we find as mundane and repetitive, but to them, they feel a different kind of specialness and become appreciate of it. They've grown attached to it. Like a reflection reminding us that we too can be grateful with an ordinary lifestyle. This, together with Kobayashi who now has her life livened up by eccentricities, speaks for a fun filled with many heartwarmers. And you know what? A fantasy day-to-day full of dragons, I can definitely appreciate such a quirky family.\\n\\n\r\nYep. Life is such dullness? Such monotone? Let's erase all that! Because the human world where this family resides in is a world brightened up by the colors of innocence and cartoony toons. Glee replaces humdrums and peculiarity replaces the usual. Every nooks and crannies envisioned from a combination of fantasy and slice-of-life, drizzled with some comedy, are animated with a lot of activity. Hey, even the fan service got that treatment as well, overemphasized or not. There's the blobby highlights nailing down the child-like look while detailed eyes refresh them as the fire-breathing beasts they rightfully are. And to soften everything up, the pastel-styled backgrounds subdue these characters against an ordinary world. As their attachment to the world grows, their expressions show both blissful and heart-warming growths. Which is something wonderful to see. It's even more precious in how there's so many emotions pronounced through the voice acting. Lively, adorable, loving. Each of this brings out Kobayashi's and the dragons' whole personality out to form them as a family. And finishing things off, the soundtracks serve as an addition that harmonize the odd and normal together. While mostly bustling with lightheartedness, the tempo can slow down into a gentle and mellow maturity, paving way to a sincerity this show has its roots in. Oh, plus the catchy opening too. Chu chu yeah!\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. Maid Dragon is a slice-of-life show that really knows how to unpack what its genre is all about. It reminds us about the positivity contained within the everyday setting that we live in. The mundane? Not anymore with these dragons. A life of no excitement has now transformed into something truly hearty, and that is certainly a wonderful thing.",

            "content": "Okay so i don't usually write reviews but things have been bugging me for a while about this anime so i want to come back to it. \r\nFirst i want to talk about a side of the community saying Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is progress for Kyoani into the shoujo ai/yuri genre. It's completely false. Like most slice of life, comedy genre anime with a cast that is mostly made of girls there is some kind of shoujo ai vibe (Hibike Euphonium for example) but even if they somehow confess, hold hands, hug, look intensely in each others eyes there is no actual ROMANCE.Not that i'm complaining because i really enjoy these type of anime anyway but there is no damn progress at all. In the first few episodes Tooru and Kobayashi hold hands, now, what happened in the latest episodes/ova even after some kind of \"confession\"? They still hold hands! No progress, nothing changed. \\n\\n\r\nAlright now that this is out of my rant let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nI'm entering a super sensitive subject that most people will be mad about but the amount of creepiness and pedophilia in this anime is off the roof. And i'm actually making this review because it's really pissing me off to see people defending it and making it look like a joke. Let's start with the less sensitive subject.\\n\\n\r\nThe hypersexualization of Kanna & Riko in the anime is really really creepy. I said it's the less infuriating subject because they are actually both kids but two little girls getting into really weird situations/positions for 99% of their scenes together is just.. abnormal? Yes it happens often in anime but why are people even defending it? The all crush thing between them is really adorable but why did they have to sexualize every single little thing between them? It's just weird but now moving on to the pedophilia aspect. \\n\\n\r\nWho even thought that a mature woman throwing her boobs into a little boys face for all the appearances they made in the anime is a good idea? The creepiest part is the community (not all of course but the comments i've seen so far are fucked up) defending this saying it's just \"innocent hugs\" and that it only look like this because she \"have big boobs\". It is clearly not innocent hugs, she sleeps on him, wanna give him her body, call him \"straightforward\" when he plays with her boobs in his sleep and make him uncomfortable so many times i lost count. It's called pedophilia she is doing it without his consent, and i'm tired of people saying this is some kind of kink because it is not! He is a young kid not a teenager getting on with a milf. \\n\\n\r\nI'm being mostly negative about it because it happens so many times during the anime that it ruined it for me. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the positive points, Kobayashi & Tooru relationship as well as Fafnir & Makoto are really the main reason this anime wasn't utter trash for me. There is also many heartwarming moments that made me smile in multiple occasions including cute family moments with Kanna. \\n\\n\r\nFor the art, as expected of Kyoani it was great. A really colorful palette, one of the best art wise that they did in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI gave a 6/10, i was really torn at first because there was a lot of sweet moments that made me happy but in the end i can't overlook the really negative things that happened and made me really uncomfortable. I would say this anime is worth watching if you don't mind the weird aspects but i wouldn't recommend it to everyone.",

Even if in some parts of the anime, an oppai character makes pretty awkward situations, is nothing too extreme oranything that makes the viewer be \"Heck, this is too much\" or \"This is disgusting...\" or again \"What the hell, reaaally?!\" ... the awkward parts are always a chain of funny gags to laugh about and nothing too extreme for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing people are judging negatively about this anime is the love between two characters, actually being kids. I can assure you, it is just genuine love, with nothing too perverted on it, and nothing to fuss about. (My opinion, it was instead reeeeally adorable to see two kids in love <3)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty simple and funny as well, the characters are just too adorable for any human's heart to bear, the ending of the anime is something very powerful and beautiful to experience, as the strong relationship between Kobayashi and Tohru is, and as well as the strong meaning on the anime of \"I'm home!\" and \"Welcome back home!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so i may have highly forgot some stuff, but believe me, this anime is really worth watching it if you want to be filled with joy and laughter on every episode, and if you want also to feel strong messages about friendship, loving each other, and daily routine with people out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Don't be like some whimps that can't even stand two boobs to be showed (with clothes on, no nudity). You're in the land of anime. If you can't understand this, then you will always complain about big breasted women and about awkward scenes happening in different animes, jerk.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S.

The animation is superb particularly with its action scenes.\r\nSound: Kudos to the voice actors. The shows allowed them to showcase their acting in comedy.\r\nCharacter:Most of the characters are amazing with several exceptions. If I had to pick who steals the whole show, it would be Kobayashi, Kobayashi's office friend, Kanna, Fafnir and Elma. The others are a mixed bag or downright atrocious. The one thing that allowed me to unable to provide a bad grade is the relationship between Kanna and Kobayashi. It's very touching that it makes you wonder why this isn't called Kobayashi's Dragon Daughter.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love the comedy bits especially with Kobayashi and Kanna.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kobayashi Dragon is a great slice of life and I do hope there would be more like this.",

            "content": "Spoilers ahead (after the first paragraph) because I don't know if I can explain some things without saying what they are.\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid starts off as a cute and funny series, with situations dealing about living at home, having neighbors, moving out, etc. It also points out some anime themes that are dumb or unrealistic such as \"anime maids are just cute and nothing else and tarnish the reputation of real maids who actually work really hard\", like the author knows and don't want to be yet another generic anime, but at the same time really likes the idea of a dragon maid, orat least that's my interpretation. That is good, you do what you wanna do and try your best, while being generic is bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem starts about... episode 7 or so. It gets appalling and lacking? There's no interesting living at home/daily life stuff to deal with and the clich\u00e9 slice of life episodes starts gushing out without any of the show's initial appeal. Dragon fights are boring because they don't really have a climax and everyone seem to have equal strength somehow. Characters get flanderized, that is, their entire character get reduced to a simple characteristic or catchphrase. Some characters don't really have any purpose to begin with (spoilers starts here).\\n\\n\r\nSuch is, when Elma comes to the human world to fight Tohru, whilst claiming they mustn't interfere with this world. She is aware that she cannot go back on her own. Basically she came here to have a dragon fight but she doesn't want to influence the place and cannot go back, and also despite saying that she is of equal strength with Tohru, it seems she knows she is weaker. She is also initially hungry and there goes most of her personality. It's not like she has a huge appetite like a shonen protagonist, it's just that food is her top priority in life. \"I came here for food\", \"I heard food I must eat\", \"This food is the best (every food is the best)\". The rest of her character is leaving her rack vulnerable to jiggles, as if Quetzalcoatl wasn't enough.\\n\\n\r\nSeikawa starts off as your common alpha bitch/brat and you understand that she's just really bad at socializing but Kanna does not run away or respond in anger so they become friends and Seikawa wasn't really a bad person to begin with. I thought that was nice, but then Seikawa just gets instantly wet whenever Kanna say or does anything, sometime just being there is enough to turn her on. Dunno how it's funny.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir is initially a blunt and harsh reality to Tohru's dreamy new life. Then he finds himself a human he likes. It's interesting because he is potentially or at least partly right, but he comes to understand why Tohru was so dreamy and happy about. Then he starts speaking in third person and do out of character things like participating in a play or trying to sell to the humans he hate a manga he made about curses. The Fafnir that was initially introduced wouldn't give a damn about those things. He hates humans. He has no fuck to gives. He developed to like video games and one otaku human. After a while he likes anything as long as he is angry while doing it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the otaku guy, I found him confusing. Is he the same character as Kobayashi's colleague or another character entirely? They look very similar but act differently, you never see them both at the same time and at the first party, the colleague is invited and starts playing with Fafnir but later on he's just gone and the otaku is there playing with Fafnir???\\n\\n\r\nQuetzalcoatl is initially a cool girl with the \"unfortunate\" appearance of a gorgeous woman which always causes her problems. It's not a bad idea to deal with fanservice while adding fanservice to the show. It's never explained how exactly what dragons look like in their human form aside from their clothes so I want to say hey it's not her fault if she's born with that body, but I dunno, never mind that because it's just hypothetical at his point. The problem with her comes in when there really is nothing to do with her after introduction so she because full-time blatant and gratuitous fanservice and she never catches on that bouncing her gigantic rack is indecent and makes some people uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason she also takes pleasure in tormenting a kid and burying him under her breasts while she sleeps. The kids' non-existent parents also doesn't seem to mind their son sleeping and bathing with her. Initially the whole demon summoning ritual and the shota (who is actually named Shota) thinking she is a demon is funny, but it devolves to sexually abusing a child all the time. It's fine when it's a girl doing it I guess?\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are fine, although sometimes Tohru's yandere traits become really strong, then go completely absent in one episode, then reappears in another episode, etc. and she almost kills Kobayashi with a beam once, which is really weird considering she's completely devoted and in love with her.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 12 when they show suddenly remembers it never showed us how Tohru and Kobayashi met, something I was wondering about since the first episode and really there was no reason to keep that part out for so long. Then Kobayashi is able to lift a giant sword from Tohru's wound for some reason? And Tohru's dreams are exactly the same as a random girl she met, which undermine Tohru's character. She wants to be a maid because a girl wanted to be a maid??\\n\\n\r\nThen in episode 13 we really have no idea anymore, so here is a last minute plot. Apparently there's a war and Tohru needs to come back and her dad kidnaps her. Then Tohru comes back, her dad follows and say you must come, she says no, he says yes, Kobayashi says no, dad says fuck you and go away. What?! That's just stupid and out of nowhere. Sure we know there's some kind of dragon/human/monster society in another world and there are factions but if you're born in the chaos faction you have to be evil, born in the harmony faction you have to be good, etc. That's just boring and it would be best not to say anything because the unknown is better than bad idea.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that the show is good, just stop watching when it starts getting boring for you because it's never going to be good again.",

            "content": "This reminds me of why i love anime in the first place. Wow i feel so warm and fuzzy right now after watching the whole show.\r\nThere are so many things i can totally relate to this.\r\nFirst it's because i also happen to be a single parent with a 5 year old daughter and believe me she is super duper cute! Kanna reminds me of her in so many ways, her (my daughter's) curiosity is what gets me the most, can't resist the cuteness! Dealing with her is somewhat challenging in some occasions, i can't just give her whatever she wants and spoil her! Hard tobe a single dad T_T but she's my joy she's all i need so i'm proud of it. Doing the best i can to be the best dad ever. Posing right now trying to look cool xD.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly i can totally relate about work, even though work is such a pain it's kinda good feeling that someone is waiting for you to get home thinking about that is really really really heart warming, thinking that what you are doing is for the people waiting for you back home, man i'm so pumped! And the stuff going on inside the house, uhhhh, I mean sometimes there are also some oddballs just come and visit us out of nowhere and make my life like a living hell but it makes the place brighter so i just suck it up and deal with it, as long as everyone's happy \"odd ball relatives\" xD.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime i can totally relate except for the dragons and stuff, come on they ain't real! But the story is surprisingly realistic, that is why i can totally relate to this, for those people who can't, just wait for your chance in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the comedic side of the anime i totally LAUGHED MY ASS OUT (LOL), the part where Tooru tries to feed her master with her tail really cracks me up, like wtf xD. And there's so much more i dunno where to begin.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is adorable like hell wow! I have a softie on such beautiful colors and wonderful characters designs. Yes! I admit i like cute stuffs! Do you have a problem with that!?\\n\\n\r\nMusic.. awwww mannn.. this is one of the animes that i don't skip the music! I freakin love it, as a musician myself i admit it is really good, it adds up to the cutesy theme of the whole anime and you guys did it pretty well pulling this one off.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole i personally give it a 10/10. That's how amazing anime slice of life it is. Thank you so much Anime Jesus for sharing me such wonderful creation! I can totally work my ass out for the future otaku's.",

            "content": "Kobayashi's Maid Dragon holds a special place in my heart and not just because it is a really damn good show. Let's go back to four months ago. I was bored and didn't know what I wanted to do, so I decided to get into anime. Yeah, it wasn't something like pokemon or attack on titan that got me into anime, I just decided on my own. So I did some research for gateway anime I should watch, which nothing came out of, so I decided to choose a random anime. Yeah that's right, I chose Food Wars, which was a terrible decisions because Ibecame bored after the first episode, so I immediately quit.So I tried to search up some anime memes on youtube, which lead me to anime compilations like ''Aqua being Aqua'' and ''Megumin being Megumin''. This resulted in me watching a compilation about this little girl with a big forehead getting aroused every time this other weird little girl did anything. I thought both looked cute, so I wanted to know which anime they came from. So yes, Kobayashi's Maid Dragon is my first proper anime that I fully watched, but I still want to judge it without my\u2026 nostalgia (I guess?) in the way. Get ready for lots of lesbians and don't lewd the dragon loli, this is my review of Kobayashi's Maid Dragon. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 {Spoilers!}\\n\r\nKobayashi gets drunk one day after a long day of work and comes across a dying dragon. She drunkenly helps the dragon and the dragon is saved. Kobayashi somehow manages to get that dragon (who is now in a human form) and even convinces her to be Kobayashi\u2019s Maid. The dragon (named Tohru) accepts it. The nexts day Kobayashi (who has forgot everything that happened the day before) finds Tohru at the door. When Tohru explains everything that happened the day before, Kobayashi first doesn\u2019t want Tohru to be her maid, but later she accepts it. So from here the story takes a backseat, but Kanna joins in, including a bunch of other characters. That's fun. I like this story. It's charming and cute. I would love to give the story a 8, but the ending is a bit of a letdown in comparison with the other episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is really good. The character models look good, the colors are nice and the body animations are fluid. But where this anime really shines are the fight scenes. Yes, fight scenes. This show has some wicked fight scenes. They are very few of them and they are always really brief, but when they happen it's like a christmas. Plus, the fight scenes are visually a nice contrast to the simple and calm artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10  \\n\r\nThe music is good. I especially love the OP. While not my favorite, it's still really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of the anime. Kobayashi is down to earth alcoholist, Tohru is a happy lesbian who wants to do everything to make Kobayashi happy, Kanna is a cute dragon loli who is actually the FBI in disguise, Lucoa is a\u2026 *cough* good looking dragon who is pretty quiet, Fafnir is a shadow the hedgehog ripoff who wishes death on all humans but sticks around for the video games and Elma has a obsession with food. The only complaint I have with the characters is that Elma is really underused. She showed that she has a pretty funny personality, but that is shoved away for a obsession with food joke that gets tiring after a while. But this is still my favorite cast of characters and (saying it again) the best part of this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10  \\n\r\nThe excellent cast and the interactions between them gave me back then a sort of vibe that reminded me of the vibe I got watching cartoon shows when I still was in primary school. This vibe is pretty nostalgic, so I was surprised I got that vibe from a media I had never consumed before. I didn't have that vibe since, which makes this anime even more special. This vibe including the amount of charm in this show has and the genuinely funny comedy resulted in a experience that I will never forget. Made In Abyss maybe made me almost cry and One Punch Man maybe made me laugh my ass off, Kobayashi's Maid Dragon made me smile.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend it if you want to watch a show that makes you smile.  \\n",

            "content": "Overall - 8:\r\nThe art and characters are fantastic, and the way the story is set up leads to some good comedy. There is a lot of the same joke, and not everything makes perfect sense, but it's a good watch if you're looking for a light hearted anime with some unique character dynamics.\r\nStory - 6:\r\nThe story setup is pretty simple, but there are times I feel like they tried to explain more things about the world, and it didn't turn out all that good. They also felt the need to make the final episodes be climactic, which I feel took away from the story insome ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode to episode stuff is what the focus is, and I'm glad it is. This anime feels like a harem anime that didn't quite pan out, but in a good way. It has a lot of the set up, many characters with unique traits to appeal to the viewers, the capacity for lots of fanservice, and (some) of the characters living with the protagonist. The difference here is that instead of introducing as many characters as possible, the anime sticks to a small cast of about 9. In addition to that not all the characters are romantically attracted to the protagonist, and to top it all of the main character is female.\\n\\n\r\nSo instead of having a very formulaic structure of introducing characters and focusing on the antics that come from them all pursuing the same person, there is friendship and comradery.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\r\nIn addition to having a great and colorful style, the animation quality is tops. They don't use the excuse of the genre not being action to save time or effort here, and the couple of action scenes it does have are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nThe OSTs are nothing special, the voice acting and sound effects are fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9:\\n\r\nThe characters are the major appeal of this series, and every one the major cast are amazing in their own regard. Kobayashi is an amazing person, and it's great to see how she changes, and how others notice these changes throughout the series. Fafnir and Makoto's relationship is one of my favorite I've seen in recent times, and watching Shota and lucoa's interactions is always entertaining. Lucoa in general is not only a great character for fanservice, but a very kind and sensible character as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8:\\n\r\nI personally tend to enjoy anime with a heavy focus on the overall story and action/drama more than most of the more lighthearted romance and comedies anime out there. That being said, this anime had me laughing, loving, and wanting to watch more, so as far as slice-of-lifes go it's pretty darn good.",

            "content": "Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon reemphasizes the themes of friendship and belonging as it charms its audience with cuteness. From the author, Cool Kyoushinsha, and the studio, Kyoto Animation, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is a slice of life anime that can definitely brighten up anyone\u2019s day through its heart-filled story and lovable characters. Even though it has elements and characters that come from the fantastic, the anime\u2019s story encourages people to reflect upon their own friendships and gauge their belonging with others. With its fluid animation and vivid art style, this anime creates a world which has a level of realism that mirrors reality but stillhas a cartoonish style that adds a subtle fantasy atmosphere. The voice acting and music of Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid also establishes a friendly and playful tone in every episode, nicely embellishing the anime as a whole. As a result of this anime\u2019s elements, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is a slice of life anime that proves to be an enjoyable and meaningful watch.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid portrays a slice of life story that follows the daily life of the character, Miss Kobayashi, and the dragons that she lives and interacts with. But, even though this anime does have its light-hearted moments, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid revolves around Miss Kobayashi\u2019s and Tohru\u2019s struggle to accept each other and each other\u2019s worlds. The dragon maid, Tohru, is an outlier of society who wants to fit in and the human, Miss Kobayashi, is the vessel through which she can learn how to fit into and live in the world. The same could be said about Miss Kobayashi who must also learn how to live in her changed world. Thus, in order to resolve this alien versus the norm conflict, the anime\u2019s heartwarming moments not only charms the audience, but also propels the growth of the characters\u2019 relationships. To compliment these heart-filled moments, there are several gags in this anime that lighten up the mood, showing the comedy of the abnormal living with the norm. This combination of comedy and heartwarming scenes illustrates the development of relationships from inclusion to affection, reemphasizing the idea that anyone can befriend someone who is completely different from herself. To evaluate, although this anime is indeed a simple slice of life story, its themes of friendship and belonging give the anime even more meaning.\\n\\n\r\nWith respect to the characters and their development, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid introduces several memorable characters that add cuteness and fun to the anime. The introduction of other dragons such as Kanna, Lucoa, Fafnir, and Elma eases Tohru\u2019s conflict of fitting into Kobayashi\u2019s world. Bringing attention to the main human character, Miss Kobayashi, even though her character is plain at first, her development throughout the anime is significant. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s development from a serious, closed-minded character to a happy, open-minded character demonstrates how Tohru and the dragons have significantly impacted her life. Similarly, Tohru also develops her trust for the humans and gains knowledge of where she belongs in Kobayashi's world. But, her character does not develop as much as Miss Kobayashi because of her loyalty as a maid to Miss Kobayashi. Summing up, the characters of Kobayashi's Dragon Maid liven up the anime's atmosphere and are very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid executes its story well with vivid art and animation. This anime\u2019s art style is indeed cartoonish, but it still captures the essence of reality in such way that makes the characters and settings seem real. The vivid animation also upholds a lively, cartoonish mood but still maintains some level of realism. In other words, the animation pays great attention to the practical movements of reality, remarkably displaying the beauty of each character\u2019s motions.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to absorb the audience into the anime even more, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid\u2019s voice acting and soundtrack embellish the story and animation, giving life to the anime as a whole. The choice of cast for the anime is well done and accurately portrays the characters\u2019 attitudes and personalities. The music also adds to the overall atmosphere of this anime. From playful and cute tunes to serious and heartwarming melodies, the anime\u2019s soundtrack greatly enhances the overall feel of the anime, making every scene even more memorable. \\n\\n\r\nThus, from anyone who wants to relax to someone who wants some enlightenment, Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid both warms the heart and expands upon themes to think about. The anime\u2019s cuteness will have audience members hooked into a story that may seem simple, but has a hidden depth to it. But, there are indeed other themes other than friendship and belonging that this anime explores. So, it is up to the viewer to find them or just sit back and enjoy a fluffy anime. To conclude, this anime is a well done slice of life anime that anyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the decision to watch this anime is entirely up to you. I acknowledge and respect all opinions about this anime and I hope that you'll read my reviews in the future!\\n\\n\r\nThank You So Much For Reading!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, Kobayashi herself writes code for a living. She seems to use a language akin to Python. Fine and dandy. But where it\u2019s really at is C++.\r\nLambdas. Iterators. Queues and deques. The \u201cauto\u201d keyword. Pointers (and now smart pointers). Sure, the language is more verbose than a dictionary, and it can be a pain in the butt with all the object files and explicit data types floating around. But it\u2019s such a fascinating, complex, and strong programming language otherwise. It\u2019s the best one out there. To me, anyway.\r\nDragon Maid isn\u2019tthe C++ of the anime world, but it constructs enough fun objects to make for a very entertaining time.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi, an adult woman of the working world, gets up per usual to head off to yet another rigorous day at the office. However, when she opens her door to leave, she\u2019s not met with a bright-blue sky but rather a green-scaled dragon \u2013 the size of her whole apartment complex. It doesn\u2019t take long, though, for the monstrous beast to turn into a sexy maid. She calls herself Tohru and commits herself to Kobayashi, thus beginning the aptly titled Dragon Maid.\\n\\n\r\nWhen first starting this show, it\u2019s easy to mistake it for nothing more than a straight-up comedy. Tohru\u2019s antics, Kanna\u2019s cuteness, and Kobayashi\u2019s drunken tirades are clearly designed to get the audience laughing at the slice-of-life silliness that this peculiar situation centers on.\\n\\n\r\nSaid situation has a lot to leverage in terms of comedy too. The premise \u2013 dragons living among humans \u2013 not only makes for a strong contrast but also gets used to a reasonable extent. One scene will have Tohru calling Fafnir on the phone where he suggests killing all the filthy humans, and in another scene the whole gang will completely annihilate a group of bullying teenagers in a simple game of dodgeball.\\n\\n\r\nThe other half of the anime\u2019s title, namely the \u201cmaid\u201d portion, also sees dividends. Tohru \u201cwashing\u201d Kobayashi\u2019s clothes with her specialized drool is both oddly sweet and pretty disgusting. She also takes care of the grocery shopping while simultaneously reprimanding a burglar with a sudden burst of speed. And one cannot forget how Tohru would be nothing short of thankful towards Kobayashi for stamping her as her personal property. After all, maids serve their masters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile neither extravagant nor amazing, the dragon and the maid jokes get the job done. However, not all the comedy serves the audience well. Despite Dragon Maid\u2019s more mature presentation, the different sexual asides don\u2019t always work. Lucoa\u2019s huge boobs are wonderful yet overused, and Saikawa\u2019s squeals of joy, while funny, are tough to explain away when the people involved are literally children.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough perhaps the show\u2019s biggest comedic misstep comes from arguably its main running gag: Tohru\u2019s tail. Tohru constantly tries to get Kobayashi to eat her meat, and Kobayashi constantly turns her down. A prime setup for eventual payoff \u2013 but the anime never follows through. That built expectation of Kobayashi finally giving in doesn\u2019t go down, leaving its most memorable joke ignored and their relationship just shy of that next major step.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s probably getting a bit too nitpicky, but it does present a nice segue with the word \u201crelationship\u201d. For, beyond Dragon Maid\u2019s comedic material, the anime cares quite a bit about exploring a theme on how family and people (be they dragon or otherwise) improve one\u2019s life for the better. However, where the comedy stands more positive than negative, these sincerer scenes often lack that necessary execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn the anime\u2019s defense, it can get there, but such scenes are rare. For example, episode seven, the show\u2019s self-titled \u201cfanservice\u201d episode, ironically contains one of the best moments throughout the entire season. After Kobayashi briefly talks with Tohru about her life and growing up, everyone heads out into the ocean (atop Tohru in dragon form) for a bit of fishing.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they relax, Kobayashi asks Tohru about her homesickness, and Tohru in turn explains how her current actions of living among the humans isn\u2019t \u201ccommon sense\u201d for her kind. Kobayashi\u2019s narration treads into overt-exposition territory, but, with thoughtful phrases like, \u201cIt drives home the difference between \u2018understanding words\u2019 and \u2018understanding each other,\u2019\u201d as well as an exchange about independence and adulthood, the scene becomes a heartfelt aside. All capped off with a tiny bit of comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, this scene is Dragon Maid at its absolute, non-comedic best, meaning not every grounded experience reaches the same level of execution. In fact, it\u2019s often the opposite, the anime struggling to present something both emotional and worthwhile. Simply because it does not have the proper writing capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s a small list of examples. In episode two, Tohru means well when she snuggles her nose with Kanna\u2019s, but the whole conversation happens too early in the season to hit home. In episode three, Tohru\u2019s grating teeth ruin Kobayashi\u2019s quiet words (comedic relief or no). In episode eight, Tohru\u2019s feelings of selfishness get resolved a bit too quickly. In episode twelve, the flashback about the carefree human girl who befriends Tohru (and incidentally influences her maid tendencies) jams itself into her background and tries too hard to conclude.\\n\\n\r\nEven if one ignores these grievances, the final episode sticks out as arguably the biggest outlier.\\n\\n\r\nIt involves Tohru\u2019s doubts and introduces her father, the Emperor of Demise. To put it bluntly, this thirteenth episode makes for a very weak finale. Tohru\u2019s whole (both literal and figurative) out-of-body experience comes rather suddenly since the implications of her situation with Kobayashi (that Kobayashi will pass away long before Tohru does) were only ever rarely referenced. I.e., weak foreshadowing leaves her inner monologue without gravitas.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the whole plot here with her father isn\u2019t handled too well. It does have some basis given that prominent theme on family, but the series of events here lacks cohesion. Tohru gets taken away and comes back without the audience seeing her side, none of the other dragons come to defend Tohru despite the time they shared together, and the entire sequence is way too dramatic in comparison to much of the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, it comes off as the show not knowing how to finish the season in a meaningful manner. Presenting instead a tonally dissonant ending sourly bittersweet for what was designed as a happy, cheerful tale.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDragon Maid steps up its execution when its art and its animation become the focus.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially so for the lady dragons and their designs. On a general level, the small details add up. Rounded faces make for a more comedic presentation. Colors will shine bright for the eyes and shift spectrums for the hair. And the variance in details, like the different horns, tails, and builds, keep their dragon selves in mind. On an individual level, Tohru\u2019s maid outfit, Kanna\u2019s pink tribal garb, Elma\u2019s work attire, and Lucoa\u2019s clothing choices make for some combination of cute, sexy, and fun between them.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the artistic direction more closely, the anime also pays extra attention to small details that improve the visual experience. Kobayashi\u2019s cheek will slightly bulge when she rests her hand against her face. Twinkling stars will surround Kanna when she\u2019s particularly gleeful. Saikawa\u2019s heart practically jumps out of her mouth whenever Kanna\u2019s cuteness overloads her circuits. The occasional caricature bubbles bring a brief stint of comedy, and more imaginative scenes, like when Tohru explains the caste system of her world, up the chances for the show to branch out.\\n\\n\r\nIt also takes extra care with its comedy-driven scenes. A flurry of black words on a white background whiz behind a character when they don\u2019t know what to say. Tohru warps Kobayashi\u2019s phrase about making a tasty meal for when she returns home to the point that Tohru remembers the scene as something out of a shoujo manga. Both Kobayashi and Georgie turn shadowy and maniacal when they will not let Tohru escape from their discussion on maids. Even just the tiny scene transitions, with the yellow canvas and the series of five black symbols, make for similarly tiny chuckles when they appear.\\n\\n\r\nAll these examples about the artistic and comedic directions just scrape the surface of what Dragon Maid does. Furthermore, they speak nothing of the cinematography techniques like lighting choices, shot composition, and changed perspectives. Each of which are of a high quality without suffocating Dragon Maid\u2019s style.\\n\\n\r\nSaid style consists not of rigorously detailed backgrounds but instead of a softness that goes along with the show\u2019s slice-of-life story. While the locations don\u2019t change much, a shot of the outside of Kobayashi\u2019s apartment, a view of the whole city below, and everywhere in-between are places light on the eyes and aligned with a soft outlook.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, for the most part, the anime\u2019s actual animation remains consistent, interesting, and sometimes impressive throughout the season. Tohru and Kanna\u2019s \u201cplaying\u201d make for an animated spectacle, but it\u2019s the more lowkey scenes that demonstrate the show\u2019s prowess. Saikawa rummaging through her basket to find a game to play. Elma looking every which way as she stresses out over the confusing computer before her. Lucoa bouncing and bobbing forward with a dodgeball in hand. Movement appears just about as much as it can throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note: The opening track and ending track visuals deserve some praise. The rotating, flying people in the OP is something that only anime can pull off. And the ED\u2019s use of miniaturized designs for the dragons, cool shots like when the camera zooms out to show the solar system, and how their bedsheets\u2019 patterns match the patterns behind them during their singsong jig and the section of the OP where just the tops of their heads are visible elevate the overall level of detail that much more.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDragon Maid contains a medium-sized cast that land all over the map in terms of execution.\\n\\n\r\nTake Kanna. Cute, deadpan, and childish, she\u2019s a soft buffer that\u2019s pretty much impossible to hate, filling the space between the overzealous \u201cmaid\u201d and the regular human quite comfortably. While Kanna doesn\u2019t necessarily need to do much else for the audience besides making them smile when she says the word \u201cmatches,\u201d much of her character is left up in the air. She supposedly pulls enough pranks to get her kicked out of her household. But Kanna never shows her pranking skills during the season, and this potential background conflict never gets resolved.\\n\\n\r\nTohru reaches a much different level. She\u2019s the bubbly, faithful woman who makes up half the anime\u2019s title, taking on a higher level of importance as a result. A fire-breathing dragon at her core but a maid (in training) in her heart, she does what she can to make Kobayashi\u2019s life an \u201ceasy\u201d one. All while learning about the humans (read: lesser lifeforms) that surround her.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Kanna, Tohru\u2019s strength comes through in her characterization, bringing comedy and feel-good vibes. She shows the difference between \u201cdragon\u201d fireworks and dragon fireworks. She drools over photos of Kobayashi as a kid. She understands more about herself through a spoon-bending montage.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, Tohru acts as the pivot that the anime uses to dive into much of its more grounded material. Given her dragon status, she views the human world through a different lens. A lens that lends itself to contrast and an outsider\u2019s perspective on the ways in which people think, behave, and grow. From a small talk with Kanna about what it means to live among versus live with humans to a sidewalk conversation with Fafnir about cherishing the present despite what the future may hold, Tohru\u2019s thoughtful edge is every bit as impactful as her comedic one.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters don\u2019t have much depth whatsoever. Arguably, Lucoa and Shouta fit this description. Lucoa doesn\u2019t become much more than a walking pair of breasts, and Shouta runs away in the same fashion whenever her chest appears. Lucoa cuts off Tohru bringing up her past with her sister, and Shouta\u2019s name is a meta joke that references the sexual situation in which he finds himself. But these miniscule details do not save them from ending up as useless characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe toughest character to pinpoint on an execution level, though, is Kobayashi. A programmer by day and a maid-enthusiast by night, this tomboyish woman quickly finds herself in the company of dragons from all walks (or maybe flights) of life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, in a strange sense, that\u2019s precisely the problem. Kobayashi, as the main protagonist, comes off as awfully convenient for the story at hand. She gets angry about some of Tohru\u2019s mistakes, but, for the most part, she takes the whole situation in stride. Essentially, it\u2019s odd how she has all this sage wisdom about life and cares so deeply about these random strangers when Dragon Maid almost never takes the time to expound more on her character. She receives very few backstory details, and she rarely talks about herself. Even something like her adoration for maids doesn\u2019t have much of a basis despite the prevalence of the motif.\\n\\n\r\nThis convenience creates a void that shadows her character to an unfortunate degree. Yet, that\u2019s interestingly part of the point. Kobayashi sometimes thinks about how she can\u2019t seem to remember who she was or what she was like before Tohru and the others befriended her. That, since their arrival, she has come to appreciate the more nuanced parts of life. So, in a way, the anime argues that this void isn\u2019t so much a negative but rather a representation for how dwelling on the past won\u2019t lead to newfound happiness.\\n\\n\r\nTo achieve this happiness, Dragon Maid continues with its family theme through exploration of a related idea: relationships.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the whole cast, a consistent detail emerges in the fact that everyone has a distinct pairing. Tohru and Kobayashi, Kanna and Saikawa, Lucoa and Shouta, Fafnir and Makoto. These dragon-and-human pairs not only deliver a dichotomous approach but also back up that claim about relationships creating happiness.\\n\\n\r\nWith Tohru and Kobayashi, the two regularly look out for one another while also doing what they can to learn more about each other. Kobayashi usually asks Tohru about how she\u2019s feeling, and Tohru fully loves Kobayashi for saving her life. They understand that they are fundamentally different, but, when they get into a friendly meal-making duel or share presents on a snowy Christmas night, it\u2019s not hard to see that their relationship is happiness incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nWith Kanna and Saikawa, their relationship is more along those comedic lines thanks to Kanna\u2019s role in the story. However, they still provide looks into why relationships rock. After her grade-school competition, Kanna values the camaraderie, saying to Kobayashi and Tohru, \u201cIt\u2019s better being with everyone else.\u201d And, when with Saikawa, she remarks how she wants the same thing that Kobayashi and Tohru share, envying their special relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWith Lucoa and Shouta, they sadly still go under the worthless category since their relationship doesn\u2019t improve or morph much at all beyond its initial introduction. Even so, with Lucoa failing to impress Shouta and Shouta embarrassed by what Lucoa puts forward, these two demonstrate that relationships can get people to bring out unknown sides to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nWith Fafnir and Makoto, this duo highlights something much more profound. Where the others (subconsciously or not) define the connections they hold, Fafnir and Makoto don\u2019t really follow the same route. Instead, they only need to say the word \u201cmild\u201d (when describing their curry for the evening) for them to be on the same wavelength. Thus, they showcase that relationships don\u2019t need to be unique to mean something more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Elma, Dragon Maid does not pair her up with anybody, fragmenting the parallelism it so cleanly built between every other pairing. Still, even more so than Kanna, Elma is there purely for comedic effect, so it\u2019s not exactly necessary to build a pairing for her too. Plus, she potentially argues the other way. That one doesn\u2019t always need a relationship to find happiness. Indeed, all it may take is a bit of cream bread or a helping of ice cream to get through the day.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nDragon Maid brings the heat with a few strong voice-acting performances, some soft musical pieces, an uplifting opening track, and a downright fun ending track.\\n\\n\r\nAs a lead star of the show, Yuuki Kuwahara as Tohru, in one of her first main roles in the industry, uses a girly voice, inhaling sounds, and various emotions like jealousy and joy to serve comedy akin to the skills of any top maid. Yuuki Takada as Elma, also relatively new to the industry, likewise lets the audience binge on comedy but more so through flustered appeals and nervous asides.\\n\\n\r\nBut the strongest performance in show goes to Maria Naganawa as Kanna. Most likely going down as her breakout role, Ms. Naganawa\u2019s infectiously cute, deadpan tone as the child dragon makes it impossible to not like Kanna from the very beginning. Just the way she says everyone\u2019s names is enough to win anybody over.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly strong, the original soundtrack goes for the same dual comedy-grounded feel that the story follows.\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy, the slice-of-life tunes incorporate lots of goofy instruments and off-kilter note structures to get at the wackiness and the simplicity of the anime. \u201cHatena\u201d includes creaking doors, \u201cUkiuki Sin Seikatsu\u201d makes heavy use of a toy xylophone, and \u201cDragon Tanken Tai\u201d brings in the light sound of a tambourine and a weird, whirling sound effect. No matter the case, though, these tracks promise a fun time for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nFor the grounded material, Dragon Maid reels everything in, presenting a lot of tracks focused on atmosphere and heart. \u201cKaeri Michi\u201d takes on an almost underwater vibe with floating piano keys and ambient sounds that gently wash over the listener. \u201cOyasumi Mata Ashita\u201d uses echoing onomatopoeia noises and a backing violin section to attain a soft, caressing feel. And \u201cSayounara,\u201d arguably the strongest track of the entire OST, strikes at the core of one\u2019s emotions, the slow acoustic guitar and the prominent cello melding together to support above and beyond those touching scenes throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the OST\u2019s tracks are bit more charged for the rarer action-heavy or menacing moments in the show, so they aren\u2019t as worthwhile in the long run. Still, what\u2019s offered otherwise is no doubt strong and a noticeable effort on the show\u2019s part.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the front, Dragon Maid uplifts the audience before every episode with a semi-groovy, semi-grandiose opening track entitled \u201cAozora no Rhapsody.\u201d The clapping and the catchy beat at the start leads into a paced set of singing before jumping into the crux of the OP. Background singers, blaring trumpets, and even better vocals raise the song ever higher. The final stretch \u2013 with faster lyrics, some bells, and a composition that mirrors the start \u2013 ends the whole thing in strong fashion.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, perhaps the crown jewel of the sound department (besides the buoying noises of the ladies\u2019 bosoms, of course) exists as Dragon Maid\u2019s ending track entitled \u201cIshukan Communication.\u201d The ED flies ahead with \u201cbops\u201d and \u201cimagination,\u201d the female dragons taking turns singing on different days of the week. Their second singing trade-off, where they bob back and forth, is deceptively cute, marking a smile-inducing transition into the second half of the track. Here, the dragons sing together, and the beat carries them along. A \u201cdaisuki\u201d here and a repeat of the beginning there make it easy to hear why the ED takes the throne.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nOnce again for this Winter 2017 season, I found myself hesitant to give an anime \u2013 this anime \u2013 more credit than I thought it deserved early on. I was worried that the drama wouldn\u2019t resonate, stealing away from the potential comedy at hand.\\n\\n\r\nI was never emotionally invested, and I still (evidently) have my gripes, but the anime grew on me nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose my one favorite aspect of the show, my pick is swift and easy: Elma. I really like her design (her work outfit with the glasses is so darn attractive). She\u2019s the most fun with her embarrassment, her justice-driven attitude, and her foodstuff dilemmas. And she adapts the quickest to her new environment, proving her maturity and her intelligence. It\u2019s a shame that she is introduced so late and is hardly around in the last couple of episodes. But, when she is present, I am extremely happy.\\n\\n\r\nKanna takes second place for me based on cuteness alone (and, indeed, the ravioli rule applies). The way she said everyone\u2019s names, her \u201cbug catching\u201d homework, all those pouts, \u201cwicked,\u201d trying to catch a snooze with her pillow, waiting on Santa (which seemed like the perfect chance to make him a fellow dragon), her rain dance. She\u2019s so cute and so fun to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nTohru ends up in third. I like her crazy devotion, her hilarious reactions, and her general cheerfulness. Her scathing remarks about humans (while also directed at me) got me laughing, and her yuri hots for Kobayashi is something I absolutely approve.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the titular character, I jump to the very bottom of my list. Yes, my least favorite character and my least favorite part of the show is Kobayashi.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bunch of nitpicky, small stuff. I don\u2019t like how she almost always leads her conversations with Tohru with \u201cTohru\u2026.\u201d Petty, I know, but it annoys me how she says it. I also don\u2019t much care for her personality and how she rarely ever says anything wrong. And could she please reciprocate Tohru\u2019s romantic feelings even just a teeny tiny bit? So much scrumptious yuri goes to waste because of her rigid refusals.\\n\\n\r\nI get that she\u2019s the straight \u201cman\u201d around all these crazy dragons, but she isn\u2019t a thrilling main protagonist since she doesn\u2019t do a whole lot. She does earn bonus points for wearing glasses (because I like a woman in glasses), but she irks me too much otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nI only liked Kobayashi when she was drunk. In fact, one of my favorite scenes in the whole show comes from when the anime finally depicts her first meeting with Tohru. She\u2019s plastered out of her mind, and, once she forces Tohru to join in on the alcoholic fun, belching fire and fits of laughter make the whole encounter awesome. Then it\u2019s back to the lame version of Kobayashi.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I still had a very fun time, and I hope KyoAni have it in them to make a second season \u2013 with an extra helping of Elma.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon brews a nice cup of tea. While the story\u2019s more thoughtful scenes don\u2019t always get where they want to, and some of the individual character writing lacks depth, the focus on comedy, the importance of relationships, the involved artistry, the high-quality music, and the general level of fun make this anime a dereferenced pointer whose value isn\u2019t null.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, a dragon-centric, slice-of-life tale hits middles in its comedy but lots of lows in its grounded material, exploring a theme on family while suffering from a notably weak finale\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Great, fun and colorful designs, an emphasis on visual comedy, strong cinematic techniques, nice levels of actual animation, and other noticeable details create a worthwhile artistic showing\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Tohru, Kanna, and the others land everywhere in terms of execution, but an important theme on relationships and happiness keep them all on the right track\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Great, strong VA performances from relative newcomers, a set of goofy and heartfelt OST tracks, an uplifting OP, and a super-fun ED support as much as possible\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Elma wins best in show, Kanna takes second, Tohru for third, and Kobayashi annoys in her lameness\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

The worst shows are ones which try to achieve a lot by berating the viewer with gimmicks and \"deep\" moral themes, but never really go anywhere. Somewhere in the middle are shows which attain what they set out to achieve, but go no further. The best shows are those which never try to accomplish anything extraordinary, but do so in spite of themselves. The more a show tries to achieve, the further it has to gobefore it can be considered \"good.\"\\n\\n\r\nMs. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid was not a show that I thought I was going to like. - it was just something I picked up to pass the time. Put simply, this anime was better than it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but praise Ms. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid for delivering on its promise. I expected dragons and, right from the first scene, I got a dragon. But as the show progressed, I found myself liking it more an more. I'm not a huge fan of comedy anime, but Ms. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is a different type of comedy anime. Sure, the series contained its fair share of lewd jokes and ridiculous happenstance, but it never fell into the trap of being cute for the sake of cuteness. Its character development was realistic; instead of forcing its characters to change direction by pulling a full 180 while never truly explaining its motives (like many anime I have seen) Ms. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid keeps things simple, offering  us a small character changes which are all the more satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a worthwhile anime.\\n",

            "content": "NOT SPOILER FREE (kinda)\r\nBritt: I started working on this review before finishing the anime (like I did with my \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" review) so that I wouldn't forget anything I wanted to say. I just finished the last episode though (today. 1/30/18). I couldn't watch it ALL the way through, since the website I used cut the episode right after Lucoa hugs Shota for whatever reason, but I'm sure it ended on a happy note. I heard good things about this anime, and it's very popular. And while I did indeed enjoy it, I do think it's a teeny bit overrated. I don't hate thisshow by any means, but I don't understand what made it stand out other than the dragon aspect. But I'll get more onto that in a second. For now, let's start with the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nTaken from \"MyAnimeList\": \"As Kobayashi sets off for another day at work, she opens her apartment door only to be met by an unusually frightening sight\u2014the head of a dragon, staring at her from across the balcony. The dragon immediately transforms into a cute, busty, and energetic young girl dressed in a maid outfit, introducing herself as Tooru.\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out that the stoic programmer had come across the dragon the previous night on a drunken excursion to the mountains, and since the mythical beast had nowhere else to go, she had offered the creature a place to stay in her home. Thus, Tooru had arrived to cash in on the offer, ready to repay her savior's kindness by working as her personal maidservant. Though deeply regretful of her words and hesitant to follow through on her promise, a mix of guilt and Tooru's incredible dragon abilities convinces Kobayashi to take the girl in.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being extremely efficient at her job, the maid's unorthodox methods of housekeeping often end up horrifying Kobayashi and at times bring more trouble than help. Furthermore, the circumstances behind the dragon's arrival on Earth seem to be much more complicated than at first glance, as Tooru bears some heavy emotions and painful memories. To top it all off, Tooru's presence ends up attracting several other mythical beings to her new home, bringing in a host of eccentric personalities. Although Kobayashi makes her best effort to handle the crazy situation that she has found herself in, nothing has prepared her for this new life with a dragon maid.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a slice of life, and slice of life usually doesn't have an \"ongoing\" story. Usually, it's just that; slice of life. So normal people doing normal things usually happen, but that clearly wasn't always the case here (considering this show has dragons anyway.) I wouldn't say there was anything really \"unique\" here, other than the dragons of course. But I did enjoy the little bit of backstory we got to see for Tohru. Speaking of the dragons though, I though it was weird how nobody could tell that these characters weren't human. I mean, the only one who even remotely looked human was Fafnir, so I can see how he'd pass for one. As for the other 4? I have no idea. It was probably done for comedy (nobody noticing this obvious aspect), but I just thought it was kinda odd. And the people who DID know they were real dragons (Kobayashi and that guy she works with), they didn't seem to care. Like, at all. But I guess if they DID care, it might've defeated the purpose. Sooo, oh well I guess. I give the story a 6.5 outta 10. I think that's pretty alright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI really liked the characters. Some I liked more than others of course, but I didn't hate any of them. My favorite (coming from a loli fan) would probably be Kanna. She seems to be a fan favorite anyway, but she was just so cute and charming. Plus, she was a realistic child character who wasn't annoying. I think those are a little difficult to pull off. \\n\r\nI also really liked Elma. I didn't think I'd like her as much as I did, but when she was introduced I just fell in love with her character. She's so weird, and her rivalry with Tohru was funny sometimes. \\n\r\nTohru is probably my third favorite. She's kinda like Elma in that she's really weird, but she's also charming like Kanna. \\n\r\nA lot of people seemed to enjoy Fafnir, but I thought he was kinda...boring. I didn't hate him, but he was kinda just there a lot of the time. Like the creator was thinking that he didn't make any male dragons, so he just threw Fafnir in there. His love for gaming was kinda cool, but was the only thing he really had. \\n\r\nAnd last but not least for the dragons is....Lucoa (or Quetzalcoatl). Now, I didn't HATE Lucoa's character. Like I said, I didn't hate anybody. It's just that...I dunno. I don't want to dislike a character because of how they're drawn, but that gets a little difficult for me sometimes. Often it seemed like Lucoa was only there to be \"that\" character, and she didn't have too much going for her outside of that. She seemed a little bit down to earth sometimes, and she was funny sometimes, but like Fafnir, she only had like one thing going for her that people would remember her by. Which is a little sad. \\n\r\nI liked Kobayashi. I don't have a lot to say about her other than I liked her, though. Her friend from work was alright as well.\\n\r\nAs for Shota and Riko.....Well....they're there. They were cute. That's...probably about it.\\n\r\nI really like the character designs, though. I don't like Lucoa's boobs, but other than those she had a nice design. The dragons (excluding Fafnir) had pretty eyes and pretty hair, and they were all super duper cute. The way they were drawn was adorable. \\n\r\nSo I liked both the characters themselves and their designs (mostly). I'd give the characters a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nI decided to separate the art and sound category this time. \\n\r\nWhelp. I love Kyoto Animation. You were all probably aware of that. Soooo, I thought the art and animation were both really nice. I loved the colors. They were bright, but not like, hurt your eyes bright. Like say, No Game No Life or something. I already said I liked the character designs, but KyoAni really made them \"pop\". I loved how each (female) dragon had a gradient in their hair, and their eyes were cool. The characters also moved very fluently, and nothing really looked out of place or stilted. They pulled off the \"Moe\" look pretty well (something they're pretty good at), and the scenes when characters were fighting were really cool and well animated. Sometimes some things were said by the characters but the art/animation didn't match what they just said (I'll explain what I mean by this in a second.) Otherwise, very good quality. I'd give this section a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI really liked the sound here. Both the opening and ending were EXTREMELY catchy, and the background music was nice as well. The sounds mixed nicely. Nothing sounded like it didn't belong. I watched it dubbed, and all the voices were really nice and I think they all fit the characters. There was only one voice I recognized though (which was Lucoa's voice. Her voice actress Cana from \"Fairy Tail\" which is why I know her. And Panty from \"Panty and Stocking\"), but I think everyone did a good job in their roles. Tohru and Kanna both sounded very very adorable, and Kobayashi's voice actress managed to pull off her stoic personality. I watched this dubbed first and never watched it subbed, but apparently the dub is \"controversial\" because a few little lines were changed (like Kobayashi telling Tohru that she's \"not into girls\" instead of saying \"but we're both girls\" or whatever. Isn't the meaning the exact same?) But I never listen to dub haters, anyway. They're usually pretty obnoxious. So all in all, the sound was great. Both the music and the voice acting. I give this section a 9, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime. I was kind of keeping it on the back burner for awhile, but I decided to finally watch it since I couldn't watch Sailor Moon dubbed anymore (sue me.) So until Viz catches up to me in Sailor Moon, I decided to pick up some other anime while I wait. If anyone has any other suggestions for anime, I'm all ears. But yes, this show was an enjoyable watch. I did in fact have some problems with it, as I do not think it was perfect. For one, I still stand by what I said when I called this anime \"overrated\". Now, overrated does not necessarily mean it's bad. I did like this anime, but it has it's problems and I don't know what made it stand out from other anime (aside from the dragons.) But I'll just talk about some issues I had with it, then end this review.\\n\r\nSometimes the characters are inconsistent. This is what I meant when I said that a character would say one thing, but the animators would do the opposite or something. Like how in maybe the first or second episode, Kobayashi told Tohru that she can't wear the same clothes every day \"like an anime character\", but I saw Kobayashi wear the same exact shirt in about 5 different episodes. I also don't understand how the clothes that the dragons wear are \"scales\" and are therefore apart of their bodies, when Kobayashi easily ripped Tohru's dress off in one episode. I ALSO don't understand why some dragons can hide their tails/horns while others can't. Was this actually explained in an episode? Or was it done just cause some characters look better with their horns than without them so they keep them? I dunno, these things confused me. It's like, did the animators get lazy or did they forget about these things or were they done for \"comedic\" affect or something? There's ALSO the episode where Tohru made omurice, and Kobayashi thought that was the first \"normal\" thing that Tohru had cooked for her before (it wasn't even normal, btw.) But beforehand, Tohru had cooked relatively \"normal\" things already. I mean, other than her trying to get Kobayashi to eat her tail, she's always cooked normal food. So...that didn't make much sense to me, either. I know this is a slice of life anime, but consistency isn't a \"terrible\" thing to have ya know.\\n\r\nI think the fanservice is ridiculous too, but then again I normally don't like fanservice at all. But here it just felt...so unnecessary. I would've been fine if it was just like, one or 2 boob jiggles here and there, but it happened so often that it got tedious. And you can't tell me \"if you don't like it, don't watch it\". That argument has always been extremely stupid to me. I could see if someone was watching a series all the way through and just kept complaining about it nonstop to a public source every single episode (like what happened in the comments of \"The Legend of Korra\" when I watched it) but if I'm going into a show that doesn't even have ecchi in the tags and I pretty much like everything else in the show BUT the fanservice, than I'm going to be disappointed. Just...I expected a teeny bit better from this animation studio. But at times they seemed a little uncomfortable with the amount of fanservice as well. At least when it came to the Kanna/Riko situations. They'd only show Riko's pervert face for about 6 seconds at most. I still didn't like it, though. I would have been fine with it if Kanna and Riko weren't freaking 3rd graders, but since they're like 6 years old, I was disturbed by how \"touchy feely\" they were with each other. Especially when Kanna licked Riko's face. I have...no idea why she even did that. I also hate the running gag involving Shota and Lucoa. Sorry to come off as a prude, but Lucoa's boobs are too freaking big. I don't understand how anyone would find them attractive. And they're not even proportionate to the rest of her body. Elma and Tohru's boobs were big enough, they didn't need to get ANY bigger than those 2. Plus, I hate how often Lucoa rubbed her over-sized watermelon chest all over a 9 year old boy. It might've been funny once, but doing it multiple times makes me uncomfortable, and it made a lot of OTHER people uncomfortable as well. I know that Lucoa doesn't think that what she's doing is wrong, but jeez Louise. It IS. I also think it's \"funny\" how a lot of folks think Lucoa is \"hawt\" and are jealous of Shota. I'm sure if Lucoa was a grown man rubbing his groin against a little girl, people would have a problem with it then. So why is it OK when it's a woman rubbing her boobs on a little boys face? Especially when he's clearly uncomfortable with it. I heard it's way worse in the manga since the original artist seems to draw \"shouta\" porn as a hobby (just what I heard, I dunno it it's true. I mean, the boy's name is Shota. So, not too far off.), so I'm just gonna...not ever read the manga. Ever. I thought the anime was too short as well, and hopefully it will get another season to explain things better (like the factions of dragons, or Tohru's dad.) Also, is Kobayashi her last name or her first name? That confused me a little. \\n\r\nI did still like this anime, so I really don't want anyone to think that I didn't. It was a fun little ride, and I wouldn't mind watching it again with someone else. So I'd give my overall rating a 7. Good show, but a little overrated and it has problems that others overlook. But still enjoyable.",

            "content": "As someone who very blindly dove into Dragon Maid, I was originally surprised \u2014 and ever so slightly worried \u2014 to discover that KyoAni was the studio responsible for this title. Surprised because the art style was in no way reminiscent of their usual works, and slightly worried because of the rut KyoAni seems to have dug themselves into over the past few years.\r\nEver since the airing of K-On!, KyoAni has settled on a very specific and easily identifiable style of character designs, featuring rounder and plump female figures sporting glistening eyeballs that practically function as mirrors, magical foreheads that reflect light with the forceof a million suns, and facial lines that somehow protrude into their faces as if some mysterious black hole took the place of their brains to perpetually pull on their own skin \u2014 perhaps KyoAni\u2019s contrived attempt at an explanation of why characters in anime tend to be so retarded.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, KyoAni has rarely deviated from this pattern in recent years, and while it was certainly eye candy upon its introduction, this type of design has lost its novelty over time and simply comes off as a lack of effort and willingness to try something new on their part. This is not to say that the quality of production is getting worse. If anything, KyoAni never ceases to amaze me with just how stunning their artwork can be, and it alone can sometimes compel me to watch and begrudgingly enjoy series I would otherwise have no particular interest in; however, this tendency to overuse previously existing templates is regrettably evident in more ways than one. From excessive homosexual undertones, to \u201cthere-may-or-may-not-be-a-second-season-buy-the-BD-release\u201d endings, KyoAni has thoroughly fulfilled, checked, and double-checked its list of things to enrage viewers.\\n\\n\r\nNow, at this point in the review, I suspect that there\u2019ll be many readers wondering what this excessively long introduction has been about. The purpose of the context I\u2019ve provided above is twofold: the first is to bring about the pleasant revelation that Maid Dragon is a refreshing departure from the olden ways and the second is to ensure that this review is of sufficient length to satisfy my feeling of self-fulfillment. This show is heavily SoL after all, and as is the case with most SoL, there isn\u2019t much to be said about the actual content.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Maid Dragon is about as simple as it gets; one night, through the sacred powers of anime inebriety, our MC Kobayashi befriends a female dragon, and the majority of the anime revolves around the minor and often humorous hiccups that occur during their time spent living together, often as a result of misaligned expectations and standards between each other. With time, more characters, both human and dragon, are introduced to add flavor to the show with character dynamics. These characters often form a dragon-human pair (or in Kobayashi\u2019s case, an enactment of two dragons one human, complete with a loli who will just about eat anything except your dick behind bars because your search history of this show will inevitably lead to your arrest, you degenerate fuck), and the show will rotate through each pairing to keep things fresh, occasionally bringing them all together for more mischief and fun. The show does, however, present some shady humor from time to time (I\u2019m looking at you, Saikawa) and contains more cheap and effortless sexual jokes than I would have preferred much less of to open up to a greater selection of audiences.\\n\\n\r\nOccasionally, the show likes to surprise you with some subtle, heartfelt moments without having to resort to melodrama that most shows do today. KyoAni treat its viewers with respect by presenting how even the smaller, passing moments in life can have an impact on how people often act or feel, and accomplishes this by focusing on how these two entirely different species come to accept and learn to coexist with one another. The fact that this overcoming of differences is the basis for both the comedic and heartwarming moments of the show doubles up very well, and can really add to the impact of the latter when they do appear.\\n\r\nThat said, when the show does take itself a little too seriously by dropping hints of heavier themes and a drearier overarching plot (namely towards the season finale), this duality formula that works so fluidly begins to break apart and the rather distasteful concoction of awkward drama that\u2019s left is suddenly forced down the viewer\u2019s throat. The viewer is simply left to stomach it until everything is sunshine and rainbows again, which thankfully isn\u2019t too long a wait. While it\u2019s certainly nice to see KyoAni be ambitious with a more impactful ending, they failed to realize that this does not necessarily have to entail a resolution to some major conflict. Non Non Biyori is a perfect example of how a SoL show can have a meaningful ending by simply bringing the show full circle and tracing it back to its roots, which Dragon Maid easily could have accomplished.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, from a story or character standpoint, it\u2019s difficult to recommend the show when so many others have come before it and accomplished the same things with a greater degree of success, unless you\u2019ve got a fetish for dragons, maids, or both, in which case I\u2019d strongly recommend admitting yourself to the nearest asylum. Or hey, perhaps you\u2019re just a fan of KyoAni and are clinging on to the ever so feeble string of hope that they\u2019ll produce something good for once (of which I am guilty as well), for which there is truly no cure or salvation. If you want a purer, cleaner comedy based on misunderstandings, Nozaki-kun is much worthier of your time, and the aforementioned Non Non Biyori is a much more easily digestible and touching light series with two seasons\u2019 worth of fluff.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the start, I had absolutely no intention of giving this anime a rating of anything greater than a seven. What, then, is the saving grace of this seemingly mediocre anime in a genre so saturated I wonder why it\u2019s still called \u201cslice\u201d of life when we\u2019ve probably gotten the whole treatment and then some? Objectively speaking, there really isn\u2019t. The soundtrack isn\u2019t anything too special, and the artwork, while pleasant, is nothing compared to some of KyoAni\u2019s previous works. Noticeably, the opening and ending themes were catchy as all hell and encapsulates the vibrant energy of the show very well, as well as the subtle elements to indicate seasonal changes in the scenery being a nice, complementary touch (courtesy of TL Notes) to the visuals. However, like lights to a Christmas tree, such little things are mere ornaments to Dragon Maid, and no number of embellishments will change the overall quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where context comes into play once more. With recent seasons being devoid of feel-good SoL, Dragon Maid is the not-so-bad answer there is to what is best available today. It is also one of the few KyoAni shows of the past few years that is a satisfying and rather complete adaptation of the source material, and a solidification of perhaps KyoAni\u2019s progression into newer territory, which was slightly foreshadowed with Phantom World. As a sinful KyoAni fan myself, I can\u2019t help but feel excited to see what they will bring to the table next, a thought that hasn\u2019t crossed my mind since perhaps Nichijou. In short, this review is less a celebration of how great Dragon Maid is, but more an anticipatory wall of text that I will greatly regret uploading since, knowing my luck, KyoAni is doomed to repeat the same mistake over and over again until the end of time. I can only hope that with this, they learn that beautiful artwork, while helpful, is not paramount to creating a good anime, because despite all of these criticisms, it still stands that Dragon Maid is\u2026good.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, I would gladly recommend the series to fans of anime looking for something new from KyoAni, or just those that would like to take a breather from the more dramatic and intense anime being released recently (\u00e0 la supernatural booty battles). The direction taken is intriguing, to say the least, and is surely worth checking out. The show remains consistent throughout, so watching just the first few episodes alone should serve as an indication of your enjoyment of what remains. The same cannot be said to friends yet unfamiliar with anime as they would probably grow increasingly concerned that I may have awakened a fetish for drawings of dragons in maid outfits from looking at the title alone, though I suppose that I have no such friends left after my viewing of OreImo and OreGairu. So sit down, buckle up, and ravioli ravioli if I see this meme again sudokuoli.\\n\\n\r\nThis review feels like an unorganized pile of thoughts, so allow me to sum up my intentions with a single phrase: watch Kemono Friends.\\n",

            "content": "Alright I wrote a review for this anime about 3 episodes in but it got removed as the show continued airing so I'll post it again, with adjustments to be made for the conclusion of the series, of course.\r\nIt's rare I give shows that look so absolutely ridiculous a chance, but the seesaw scene in episode 2 really caught my attention. Before this show even came out, I heard people already saying it ruined anime, and honestly, I had to agree. But it never hurts to watch the first 3 episodes, that's what I always say. So I did. And boy was I pleasantly surprised.\r\nStory\r\nMaidDragon's premise is simple and easy, but luckily not over-done. Our protagonist, Kobayashi, gets wasted and meets a dragon in the woods, whom she offers to become her maid. Later, the dragon shows up at her door and takes the form of an adorable human girl who has fallen madly in love with her. It is only later that we see the characters' motivations for allowing each other into their lives, and as the show goes on, the mystery surrounding Tohru and her origins gradually builds up and comes to a boiling point in the final 2 episodes.\\n\r\nEach episode generally revolves around the Kobayashi household (Tohru, Kobayashi, and Kanna) and/or the various friends they make. Episodes are generally split up into 3 or 4 little skits that take a few minutes to begin, build up, and conclude. It keeps the pacing and general feel of each episode fresh, and makes it so each story arc is exactly the right length to keep you interested, but not draw out parts longer than need be.\\n\r\nSo yeah, this show is pretty much a lighthearted comedy slice-of-life with a bit of precious GL and a dash of tragic backstory and character introspection. Very nice, overall. Sweet, but takes a bittersweet turn when it needs to.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot really a whole lot to say here. Kyoani takes this show into a pastel direction with light, bubbly shading, the animation is smooth and clean, and the characters are all very distinct and memorable. I very much appreciate the diversity in the dragons' designs, in particular, as it has a lot of different types of dragons (classic green with scales, fluffy ones with fur, aquatic ones, etc). Kobayashi's drab appearance is comical in comparison to her scaly acquaintances, despite her Bright Red Anime Protagonist hair.\\n\r\nOne complaint I have is that I wish we could've seen some of the other dragons' real forms more. We see glimpses of them, but we see Tohru's real form much more often. But that's my own personal view on it and it probably won't even bother anyone else.\\n\r\nAnother thing to be on the lookout for is fanservice. One dragon in particular has A LOT of fanservice surrounding her, and it gets rather stale at times, though the series does tone it down in the last third of the series. There are two other dragons, including Tohru, that have some fanservice-y moments, but it's certainly nothing distracting (and this is coming from a hardcore fanservice critic). Some episodes or scenes may bother you if you are picky with that kind of thing, but overall it's not a fanservice-heavy show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWith any slice-of-life, you can never expect much from the background music. It has just the right pauses for comedic value, interesting instrument usage, but nothing is generally memorable as you would expect from something like a shounen or sports anime. However, I am very fond of the OP and ED, which are just precious and catchy and honestly I'm just gushing my own opinion. But yes. Good music, nothing memorable, but it suits the show just fine. I doubt you're watching this show for the music.\\n\r\nI personally love Kobayashi's seiyuu; it's nice to see some deeper voices in anime for a change, especially for a grown woman who's likely in her early 30s. The other voice actors all do their jobs very well, especially Tohru's. She captures the essence of love and adoration perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNow that the show has concluded, I can finally give real, finalized thoughts on the characters. Tohru and Kobayashi are absolutely precious and surprisingly complex characters, so I'll talk about them first.\\n\r\nKobayashi is a bit of an introvert who has a few friends and lives a boring, lonely life as a generic office worker in a small apartment (and god is that relatable). And at first she seems fine with this. She goes drinking with her coworker, watches some TV, is generally content. She doesn't quite realize what she'd been missing until the chaotic Tohru comes storming into her life, practically demanding her hand in marriage. Throughout the series we get to see Kobayashi reflect on her boring, mundane life before Tohru and it's very sweet to see her slowly start to appreciate her newfound hectic existence surrounded by quirky dragons. Her actions in the final episode also nicely solidify her feelings and give us a final conclusion to her character arc that is very satisfying.\\n\r\nTohru is a character I didn't think I would adore as much as I do. She's newer to human customs and has a lot to learn, and while she looks down on humans as an inferior species, she seems fascinated (and absolutely enamored) with Kobayashi and her strange culture. Tohru is quick to judge humans and has no problem killing a few if she has to. She's overall an excellent foil character to Kobayashi, who's lived her whole life with her monotonous human existence, and now finds someone completely enraptured by it. Tohru finds mundane human things either revolting or fascinating, and she has a dark home life that is consistently hinted at until it comes to a culmination in the final episode, where she realizes her love for Kobayashi trumps her fear of her home life and her responsibilities in the other world; Kobayashi gives her a place to belong.\\n\r\nKanna is a young dragon who moves in with Kobayashi after a failed attempt at getting Tohru back. She's a character who learns most of her knowledge of humanity from Tohru, who already has a hilariously skewed view of it, so her interactions with the gang are always funny. She later meets a young girl who falls in love with her and finds herself wanting to blend in with human life more and more. She reveals Kobayashi to be like a mother figure to her, as her actual parents are very distant and cannot be there for her.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are a lot of other dragons, humans, and various support characters I could discuss, but suffice to say that they are all so full of life and have their own things going on despite being part of the main story. I would've liked if they had all had more part in the grand finale, though it makes sense that they would not want to get involved. A certain character (no spoilers) reveals that the other dragons all ended up in the human world because they followed Tohru (intentionally or unintentionally), and I believe that was an interesting twist on the fact that there are now suddenly a bunch of dragons living in human society.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Kobayashi and Tohru develops slowly but surely throughout the story. I appreciate all the little things that make their romance so great, the flirting from Tohru, the old married couple bickering, the introspection in each of the characters' minds elaborating on why they are thankful to have each other. It's a slice-of-life so they don't really have any real conflicts with each other, but there are obviously forces that will try to keep them apart, and the story has several skits where they acknowledge and move past these things.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nThis is a fun show you can relax with after a long day, and that's really all it needs to do. It won't enthrall you with gripping emotional tension, nor will it enrapture you with a stunning OST or crazy battle sequences. It makes you smile, and if it can pull even one smile onto your face per episode, then it's done its job. There's some interesting lore and sad backstory in the shadows, and overall, it's become one of my top anime this season.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation or KyoAni has always been on the ball with their shows.  As pioneers of the moe genre that helped flourish it into its own set of tropes and tiresome cliche everyday writing, one has to wonder what kind of box hasn't been ticked off yet on themes or gimmicks that haven't been utilized yet.  Well, what about dragons?\r\nStory: Our story beings with Kobayashi.  Kobayashi is your typical white collar worker who travels to work, sits at her desk, maybe goes out to drink with a friend, then go home.  She's welcomed to an unusual sight one day upon leavingfor work, where instead of the bright blue sky that she's used to seeing, she comes face to face with a giant dragon head who morphs into a girl in a maid outfit with churros attached to her head.  As it turns out, Kobayashi met this dragon, named Tohru in a drunken stupor, and did something to that now the dragon is indebted to her.  Lovely.\\n\\n\r\nBased around something of a 4-koma manga, Kobayashi's maid dragon is, in simple terms, an everyday comedy featuring dragons.  The intrigue of this slice of life comedy comes from the fact that the majority of the cast are dragons that go around adapting to human life (specifically Japanese life) in various ways.  Everything from NEET behavior, to going to school, to completing the housework.  The comedy stems from actively meshing the dragons unfamiliar to human life with a variety of common situations, creating a multitude of snappy jokes that never get heavily reused.  Sure there're quite a number of gags that do get reused, but they're never done so heavily that they get tiresome or lazy.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile indeed the show is a comedy, what separates Kobayashi's Dragon Maid from most slice of life comedies is the profoundness with what it does.  The gimmick of the dragons extend further beyond just \"Oh, we don't know human society herp skerp\" comedy and becomes a message about coexistence, and how beings can grow closer to one another when differences are set aside and understanding can be accomplished.  It's a strange yet comforting aspect of the show that's used a fair amount and definitely is given the attention it deserves.  My only gripe is how the show flip flops between comedy and insight so rapidly.  A cutaway later, and everything is wiped clean.  I honestly wish that the show handled the sudden changes of tone much better, because the show really does have a good message that it delivers on fairly well.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Little reusing of comedic gags\\n\r\n+ Meshes its message fairly well\\n\r\n+/- Everyday comedy (comedy is subjective)\\n\r\n-  Some hard tone shifts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, the show revolves around dragons.  While the cast is more or less split half and half with dragons and humans, the majority of who's showcased leans more towards the reptiles of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi, as the main human character of the show, acts mainly as a counterbalance to the dragon shenanigans of the show.  As the main human representative, Kobayashi's character revolves around her obsession of maids, to the slow and gradual change from her monotonous life, to one surrounded with draconic creatures from another world.  The inviting aspect of her character comes from how transparent her relationship with the main dragon, Tohru, is.  You see genuine change, you see something actually form and develop with her, and what this ends up creating is a likable character that slowly feeds the audience information about who she is and what her beliefs are.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's, as mentioned before, Tohru.  The main dragon of the show and Kobayashi's maid, Tohru's main trait is the fact that she love Kobayashi.  Acting as her personal maid, Tohru's main goal in the series is to gain Kobayashi's affection while spiting the rest of humanity because...humanity sucks.  Similar to Kobayashi, Tohru's character is a malleable personality that morphs and shifts with each passing episode.  You see her settle in and understand humanity more, ultimately achieving growth that is both noticeable and comforting to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast comprises of various other dragons like Kanna, Lucoa, Fafnir, and Elma which all adapt and meld into human society in their own ways, and various human characters that similarly, act as different pillars in (Japanese) society.  When compared to Tohru, the rest of the dragons don't really have too much of an arc or a large amount of change to them.  If anything, they have a short little arc to show us how they've changed, then their time in the spotlight is over.  My main complaint comes with how most of the dragons (especially in Elma's case) feel so underutilized.  I feel like the show could've done more with some of them rather than let them be another gag for comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview: \\n\r\n+ Noticeable character development\\n\r\n-  Some characters in the side cast feel underutilized\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by KyoAni, the art for Kobayashi is crisp, bright, and all around, good quality.  Compared to some of KyoAni's previous works, Maiddragon just doesn't feel like it has the same quality.  True the company didn't slack, as even compared to 'standard fare' the show looks great, but when compared to previous works like Euphonium, Chuunibyou, and hell, even Phantom World, the art for Maiddragon is average in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what really makes Maiddragon different comes from the dragons.  Tohru is a dragon.  Dragons have teeth, claws, and have magical powers.  There're a number of times when the comedic visuals of the series turn into this ravagefest where Tohru bears her true colors as a dragon and displays some quite unsettling imagery for a joke.  It's a small detail, but one I appreciated because the character, is a dragon.  If a creature mythically known for death and destruction didn't have some kind of portrayal to showcase its ravenous behavior, I'd be a bit disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, clean art\\n\r\n-  Not as good looking as previous works\\n\\n\r\nSound: Made by fhana, the OP for Maiddragon has a unique, upbeat tone that's actually very catchy.  At first, it doesn't feel like it fits the show, but then you get used to it, and it becomes actually quite fun to watch and listen to.  It has a clear beat that you can bob your head or clap along to, so it's definitely a song made to get stuck in your head.  The ED on the other hand is a more casual song sung by the seiyuus of the four female dragons in the series.  Compared to its OP sibling, I wouldn't say it's as catchy, but it's actually quite memorable and cheerful.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite my initial wariness with Maiddragon, as its original manga didn't really pique my interest all that much, I have to safely say that the show was quite enjoyable.  Its character growth and the discussion of coexistence between two or more different parties was not only something I wouldn't have expected from a series about a woman and her dragon who is also her housemaid, but was a part of the show that was prominent and something that I really enjoyed.  Even more than the random antics.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFavorite dragon: Elma.  All you Kanna fans out there, deal with it.  The loli is second rate to the glutton and you know it!  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the faulty transitions of the show being too abrupt with changing from profoundness back to comedy, another thing I found trouble with was how little the serious aspects of the show came to light.  Honestly, the show could've done more, and I would've liked more of that aspect instead of more Tohru antics.  Cause if you asked me, it meshed in a lot better than what was probably anticipated.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn the spectrum of comedic slice of life, Kobayashi's Maiddragon to me, rates pretty high.  I think above all, the show is enjoyable and has aspects of it that you're not really going to find anywhere else.  Sure it may be another piece of moe waifu bait hung in front of you, but in my opinion, Maiddragon has much more to offer than just that.",

            "content": "And here's to you, Miss Kobayashi\r\nDragons love you more than you will know\r\nWo, wo, wo\r\nPersonally I think that \u201cKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\u201d is easily the greatest anime of the season, the anime of the year and probably one of the best and the most moving anime ever made. The purpose is so simple: Tooru, a dragon from another world, is found dying by a drunk woman, Kobayashi. Saved by her, she decides to take a human form and become her maid. Second comes Kanna, a child dragon, probably the cutest thing that ever appeared in an anime. This leads to a chain of eventsentailing the presence of some other dragons coming to earth, interfering with humans and learning the other.\\n\r\n1. The notion of \u201cthe other\u201d is quintessential. It\u2019s all about the other. The creators go even further expanding this to a posthuman context and depicting an interspecies friendship.\\n\r\n2. Dealing with changes. Going to school for the first time, being able to choose freely for the first time, having friends and taking on yourself multiple vital roles for the first time. There are a lot of such examples and \u201cKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\u201d is about those changes that petrify human beings. The anime makes us view life in an optimistic way. Although humans and even the mightiest dragons fear to adapt, you don\u2019t need to remain sheepish. With a little help from your friends you will succeed.\\n\r\n3. Progress, deconstruction and transgressions. For the first time I see an otaku (Takiya) presented in a positive way. I see a new way of giving yourself to the others, though it\u2019s only a comedic element (Tooru trying to deceive miss Kobayashi by offering her... her tail). Innocent yet kind of lewd first love between Kanna and Saikawa. And the most important: a very slowly built ambiguous relationship between extrovert Tooru-chan and introverted, withdrawn Kobayashi-san. The reciprocal submission and emotional interdependence start to come out. The two girls learn to know lives and habits of each other, they try to impress one another. The slicest-of-life SoL I have ever seen since reading \u201cYotsubato!\u201d. I don\u2019t care there are dragons and magic.\\n\r\nA maid is a trope that has been known in anime for ages, so \u201cKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\u201d is a very particular realization of the genre. Opening song, ending, division into funnily titled chapters, voice acting, style... I have no complaints.\\n\r\nI just enjoy the show.\\n\r\nIt was deeper and more intelligent than I ever thought it to be, having seen the poster for the first time. What a surprise!\\n\r\n10/10. Without a shadow of a doubt.",

            "content": "How easy is it to write a review for a slice of life anime?\r\nOften times, a slice of life anime, or comedy for that matter, is really just a hit or miss for some people. Luckily, while speaking of Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, it's a slice of life and more, and I'm going to attempt to explain the appeal of it beyond its aesthetic cuteness. Because honestly, it's just a beautiful show. \r\nA lot of what makes this anime good is how relatable it can be to us, not necessarily because we have cheerful, goofy dragons around us. And that's not a coincidence either; Dragon Maidviews the world with a glass-half-full approach, even when we can relate to the bitterness and longing sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character is Kobayashi, who is a very relatable character by, I think, a lot of seinen viewer standards. A working young woman who is so diligent at work that it comes at the cost of having no light in her life when she comes home from the day, and often just sleeps off the fatigue. She is not boring: she simply has never had time to do other things with her life. It's honestly interesting how they frame the character, because her responses to a given situation are expected of a character who has become emotionally distant by practice, but doesn't necessarily mean she is not compassionate or that she dislikes fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe complete opposite of her is the very simple-minded Tohru, a dragon who transformed into a human form in order to serve Kobayashi. Oh yeah, and she's blatantly in love, in every way, with Kobayashi for some reason that doesn't need explaining really (it's an anime). Tohru mostly is just a vehicle to grab in viewers with her cutesy moe actions and over-the-top love of Kobayashi, but there is substance to her character overall. She represents someone who is so outside the normal conventions, trying to assimilate in a world where Kobayashi had to lose her flavor to do so, Tohru does while keeping a cheery and larger than life personality about her. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment we meet Tohru is where we draw a very gray and murky line between fantasy and reality. We certainly relate to Kobayashi, but can we really say there are people out there with the bubbly personality of Tohru, despite life's flaws?\\n\\n\r\nMaybe. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what makes this series so great. It's not about what life is: we know all of that already. It's about what life can be, and it shows it in the most fun and charming way possible. It shows complex relationships through the lens of not-so-complex slice of life. Sometimes, the characters will have a bento box making showdown just because. Is it cute and silly? Sure. But it does have its place and purpose outside of just that. The show subtle suggests its because the main characters have grown a playful rivalry with each other over the course of their time together, which itself is a benchmark in their friendship. \\n\\n\r\nThese sorts of subtle hints of motivation and development allow the series to not feel as if we are constantly stuck doing the same day-in-the-life-of Kobayashi, but makes you feel as if you are growing with the seasons.  And speaking of which, from beginning to end of the series, we get to see the remarkable changes that Kobayashi and Tohru go through in their wacky relationship from the beginning of the series to the end.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life denotes the same old shenanigans all episodes round. But Dragon Maid is not that at all. From the start, where we see simply just Kobayashi on her lonesome, to a group of wacky and fun characters together as a family, it really is a heartwarming and beautiful experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple, but damn. When it wants to be expressive, and that is not uncommon, it is INCREDIBLY gorgeous. Beautiful coloring and shading, many drawn frames for movement, I mean it's one of Kyoto Animation's most beautiful looking works, in my opinion, despite most shots being pretty standard fare. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love how simple and cute the soundtracks can be. The opening and ending are just adorable. But I might think that that background music isn't particularly extensive, because they pull a lot from the same soundtracks per episodes, so it might sound a bit too familiar after a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne word. Kobayashi. Simply put, the rest who are important are Tohru and Kanna, maybe Fafnir and Takiya. Not the most complex characters, but still loveable and genuinely heartwarming. \\n\\n",

However, I haven't been a connoisseur of dragons until now. I appreciate their \"D-cup for dragon\" dragon lolis are a match made in heaven.\r\nThe animation is perfect (the twister scene being a great example with Lucoa always having a high budget to animate her).\r\nThe plot and plot areamazing; some plot goes to plot some plot to become plotty with plotting plot and plot.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with this fine work of modern animation is that there should have been more \"dragon lolis\" - I need more for my basement collection and my 200TB stash of hentai.

Kobayashi and Tohru functionas a functional married couple to Kanna, another dragon who's come to live in the human world, and they are visited by several a few other dragons who have come to take of residence in the human world. The bigger \"adjustment\" story is all around the dragons, as the humans who are aware of the dragon's true nature largely get over their fantastic origins quickly and go back to trying to live their lives in relative peace.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series you get the typical moe and otaku set ups, a visit to the beach and Comiket, to mundane but cute cultural celebrations like attending a school Sport Festival and spending the entire New Year wrapped in the warmth of a Kotatsu. It's a fun romp through a world of goofy magic antics and at times touching character development. Here's hoping for a Season 2 on the way.",

            "content": "I haven\u2019t really been into anime in recent years, let alone seen one through all the way to the end, but I was really curious about Kyoani's latest venture back into the slice of life genre. While I will say that it does have the numerous issues that all anime of this sort have, it was consistently interesting, funny and even heartwarming.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nMaid Dragon's biggest success as an anime is it's ability to keep up a fast pace throughout the episodes. Plots are simple and gags don't drag out for too long, and some character moments are as short as 30 seconds before moving on.The latter being a refreshing take on character development within the slice of life-comedy genre. It gives off this sense that it knows you've seen so many similar setups before and dives straight for the meat of what people want. That being said, it's explanation/setup for the initial relationship between the two main characters is poor, and doesn't leave an adequate reason or foundation for the actions of Tohru within the first few episodes. The lore of the universe is also unclear, the human characters have varying and unrealistic levels of surprise in witnessing dragons/magic, and characters like Shouta reference magic being used in the human world (in the form of alchemy) with no prior explanation that humans may already be aware of this. I may be reading into this too much though, as this is most likely a sacrifice for keeping up a fast and fun pace, and Maid Dragon is definitely an anime that doesn't take itself too seriously in the first place. A strength in regards to this however, is that Tohru's backstory and earlier lifestyle is the main source of comedy in many scenes, providing both character development and comedy simultaneously, as well as adding to the lore.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from KyoAni, the characters have a distinct art style to them which makes them stand out from similar slice of life/fantasy series. The colourful Ombr\u00e9 hair and detailed dragon eyes of the main protagonists really make their designs seem full of life and vibrance. The animation itself is standard in non-action scenes (in which there are obviously a lot of), but every few episodes a fight scene will show off the excellent degree of animation the studio is capable of. If I had one complaint about the character designs it would be that the dragon characters respective dragon forms are very uninspired and generic for the most part, especially Tohru's. Fanservice is also used interestingly in this anime, as the only characters who are actively sexualised are the female dragon characters, perhaps suggesting an element of fantasy to their perfect bodies in comparison to every other female character on the show, including the MC. That being said, Lucoa's sexualised design is flat out difficult to look at, probably because every other character looks fairly normal/realistic (within reason) in comparison. In addition, the fact that every female dragon character is sexualised from the onset doesn't help claims that Kanna (a dragon character who is a child) is also pandering to a specific demographic ready to sexualise her appearance (more about this below). The backgrounds are fairly average, background characters are drawn well with a good amount of variation, and specific items such as plastic covering or food are drawn in a way very pleasing to the eye (very classic of anime slice of life).\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot really much to say about the OST of the series, it provides a few cute goofy tunes (that accordion one being my fav) that don't really get old, both the opening and ending themes are also incredibly catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the best character on display here is Kobayashi (the human MC). She has a noticeable arc of development and attitude towards the other characters, and from the outset, consistently displays different moods and reactions in regard to the situations she is in (whether drunk, passionate, annoyed, anti-social etc etc). Her range of actions is a possible reference (though I might be reading into this too much) to her humanity and how the other Dragon characters have to cope and understand with the levels of varying human emotion. Kobayashi also manages to display a range of emotions while also sticking to a core personality trait, making her interesting and not too over-complicated. These traits in an MC are almost never present in an anime about cute girls surrounding a plain main character. I was also surprised and keen on the fact that Kobayashi was not male, which if were the case, would instantly make this a harem anime. The argument that \"well Tohru is in love with Kobayashi so there is no difference\" sadly doesn't really work due to lesbian relationships not really being seen as valid - the whole thing is almost identical to the dynamic between Natsumi and Koyuki in Keroro Gunso.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point where i come to why I and many others are disgusted with the show - it's depiction of child characters, even leading onto paedophilia. Whilst many other reviews have mainly mentioned one aspect of the shows unsettling and recurring treatment of child characters, I\u2019d like to mention three that are present. The first being the recurring gag of a well-endowed female character frequently pushing her breasts onto a child character in a forceful way to repeatedly embarrass the child (this character also attempts to molest the child as \u201cusing her body\u201d is the only way to get his attention) this gag is simultaneously paedophilia and misogynistic. The second being the relationship between two female child characters, wherein whenever one shows physical contact with the other, that other person will then react with a demonstration of extreme infatuation (like a nosebleed) as a running gag. Although it was already pretty weird seeing two children act this way to one another, in episode 6 there is a particular series of scenes in which the children play twister, which leads on to the children emulating something that looks like the beginning of sexual contact before they are interrupted by other characters. This is incredibly disturbing to watch, especially as their designs resemble very, very young children. The third being the whole presence of Kanna (the child character) itself - her design, and many scenes that she is in depict her in a way which is making obvious appeal to \u201clolicon\u201d fans, such as a scene in episode 6 where she falls on the bed (the most pandering/disgusting scene in the whole anime imo), a gag in which Tohru is seen to be licking her naked body, and a strange yuri bait scene where it looks like Tohru and her are about to kiss ? This along with the fact that her general character design includes legs that stick out more so than any other child character on the show, and the fact that there are literal waves of comments of people talking about her as a loli character in any video compilations of her make it clear that the creators are clearly pandering to a specific market of fans. This becomes more distressing as Kanna is frequently shown taking part in actions and situations exclusive to children. Her going to school, the fact that she throws tantrums, even her drawing being very childlike all becomes very disturbing. This often led me to not appreciate the many great/cute scenes that she has, as I personally was constantly weary of these tropes popping up.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also a shame that one of the characters that entered later in the series didn\u2019t really get a clear development and was kind of pushed under the rug shortly after they appeared, even though it seemed like they would receive more development. However, the two male characters present are both really well done as far as I\u2019m concerned, they were full of personality and gags on their own which is another concept that doesn\u2019t frequent girl-centric (or male pandering) slice of life anime. Their relationship truly reads as genuine and is enjoyable to watch. Lucoa\u2019s character (the main source of fanservice) is fairly nondescript and undeveloped, but as the writers introduced and portrayed her in a very side-charactery/understated way this is sufficient and doesn\u2019t really bother me. Finally, Tohru's character was continually endearing and entertaining for me to watch, and her love for Kobayashi is really heartwarming at several points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhile I was thoroughly irritated and ready to quit the show around episode 6 (where the paedophilia stuff got too much for me) I ended up sticking around and watched all of it, and I will admit that it was highly enjoyable, and provided a finale which had an interesting amount of emotional release. As aforementioned, this anime\u2019s greatest strength is to just accept the genre for what it is, and not pretend it's higher or better than any other slice of life anime. Whether this means stooping to the lowest levels of fanservice, or creating a simple but effective comedy is debatable. In my opinion, it\u2019s treatment of fanservice and child characters were its worst points, and ones which unfortunately frequent many other similar anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = (7/10)\\n",

            "content": "Watching Kobayashi-san's Dragon Maid reminded me a lot of Manabi Straight!. They are both \"moe anime\" who try to do something different. Manabi Straight tried really hard to shoe-in some sort of environmental drama which just made the \"cute girls doing cute things\" not that fun to watch.\r\nMeanwhile, Dragon Maid tries a lot of different things. At it's core its a slice-of-life, but it tries to do romance, ecchi, comedy and even some drama. At least for me, it was too much. This is not really a objective look into the series, more of my personal feelings about it.\r\nSo, you have this dragon who becomesthe house maid of a lonely programmer. Then, hijinks ensues, right? Well, not really. Life stays pretty much the same, except the maid is always trying to make her master eat her tail. Some more dragons show up, but none feel right. Kanna is cute! So cute, I almost died of cuteness every time she showed up. But that's it. That's the entire depth of her characther. In a moe anime, this should be enough, but somehow it doesn't. Lucky Star's Tsukasa, Azumanga Daioh's Chiyo and more were all cute, but they also had a great deal of personality which made them great to watch for hours which Kanna lacks. Then you have the serious attractive male dragon who just decides he wants to be an otaku for the rest of the series and not much else. I'll always be greateful for Lucoa's because I'm sure she will be great on doujins, but in the series she felt out of place almost the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nSo you can see the pattern here, the series has a bunch of characters they can never make truly great. Their designs and voices are top notch(Where did Kyoto Animation ever let us down in this department) but the personalities are just not there. \\n\\n\r\nIf not for the amazing animation, music and character design I would have probably dropped before the end, which I did for Manabi Straight.",

The story is both enjoyable and at some points quite relate-able too. It combines both subtle and blatant humour almost seamlessly and with the addition of romance and well.. dragons, its something that anybody can come to enjoy. \r\nthe light connotations of adult humour make it funny for the older audiences but there are younger laughs aswell and i often find myself thinking i may be giving too generous reviews but this title honestly deserves all the praiseand more.\\n\\n\r\nmy only upset being that it doesnt go on for longer, an anime about a dragon trying to fit in with humans and while she wins and fails along the way it ultimately results in a very good anime that i think is a must watch for any anime fan.\\n",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, or The Maid Dragon of Miss Kobayashi is complete and utter trash. The only Kyoto Animation production that I hate more than THIS series is Amagi Brilliant Park. I dropped Musaigen no Phantom World after one episode. I am truly of the opinion that Kyo-Ani doesn\u2019t know how to do an explicit, adult-oriented show without it seeming creepy and depraved.  \r\n\t\u2022 I wanted to like Miss Kobayashi, in fact, I find Tohru incredibly sexy. But realistically, even if you like her design\u2026 there\u2019s nothing more to Tohru than her lust for average joe Kobayashi. To make it moreof a fetish, she wears a maid outfit and is a beasty because of her horns and tail.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 And if you think Tohru is a poorly conceived character\u30fc the others are much worse. I can\u2019t remember anything about Elma, except she\u2019s a business-woman tsundere? Kanna is the loli-bait that is much older than she looks because she\u2019s a dragon, which comes with some creepy implications. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There\u2019s a girl in fucking elementary school who is hardcore trying to get in Kanna\u2019s panties, and they\u2019re like eight? What? And she makes this disturbing rape/\u201cfucked silly\u201d face which I did NOT like at all. And if you follow the technicalities of Kanna\u2019s REAL age, they really shouldn\u2019t be hanging out in her bedroom alone anyway?\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Let\u2019s not even begin with gigantic tits and the shota. There\u2019s really creepy, sexual innuendoes between this massive-titted dragon woman and a little boy who happens to be a mage. She constantly walks in on him in the bath and crushes him with her boobs while he\u2019s sleeping, and it\u2019s creepy and too raunchy for me. Because I don\u2019t get sexually aroused by children. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I\u2019m sure people would not be okay with it if it was a little girl and a dragon dude was constantly smacking her in the face with his penis and trying to bed her. Can we not normalize older woman on little boy sex anymore in anime? It\u2019s fine if it\u2019s in hentai\u2026 because if you\u2019re watching porn, you\u2019re probably looking for some kind of depraved fetish anyway, but leave it out of a normal, light-hearted series!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The only light in this shit hole of a tunnel is the relationship between Makoto and Fafnir. That was one of the most sweet and endearing portrayals that I\u2019ve seen of a homosexual relationship in an anime\u2026 too bad the series had to make all of the other characters walking sex bags. There\u2019s literally a shot of Kanna that looks like she\u2019s giving Kobayashi oral; I felt oversaturated with the massive amounts of sexual innuendo.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, I assume that Kyoto Animation is going through some kind of rebellious teenage phase, like the, \u201cNo, Mom, we don\u2019t just make pure-hearted girls with thigh gaps!\u201d But, it just isn\u2019t working. I would never respect or go near someone who liked this abominable trash, I only give it a 3/10 instead of a 1 or 2 because of Fafnir being a boss and the animation quality.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Colourful Character Design\r\nOne of the things that attracted me to this show is its over-the-top, sensational character designs. The dragons are all wonderful to look at, and enjoyable in their uniqueness. Their traitsand specialities shine on screen, helping keep them the focal point of the show (for good reason).\\n\\n\r\n- Beautiful Art Direction\\n\r\nThis show has absolutely wonderful art! Its backgrounds are unique in their water-colour approach, and provide a very pretty light background to many large environment shots. They also do not feel out of place or forced, but rather give off a relative serenity to be associated with the outside world juxtaposing the characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Surprisingly Diverse Animation\\n\r\nI can't believe a Slice of Life show like this was able to pull off some of the action sequences it did so well. Any over-the-top sequence the dragons took part in (and there were many) were accentuated by a shockingly well done set of action animations. It perfectly conveyed the actual power of the dragons, and made those scenes absolutely pop out compared to the day-to-day scenes, which is exactly what they were supposed to do.\\n\\n\r\n- Kanna\\n\r\nKanna the tiny dragon child is aboslutely adorable. I don't think I've ever smiled and said \"AWWW\" so loudly or so often at an anime. Ever. Perfect example of children characters not needing to be overly annoying to still be important and cute in anime. 10/10 would watch entire side-series about her.\\n\\n\r\n- Heartwarming Moments\\n\r\nThe interactions between the small makeshift family of Kobayashi, Tohru, and Kanna provide some incredibly heartwarming moments along the way. While the show's main focus is clearly light hearted slice of life and comedy, the show never forgets to gracefully tug at the viewer's heartstrings, investing us all in the family dynamic (flaws and all).\\n\\n\r\n- OP/ED\\n\r\nProbably my personal favourite OP of all time (so catchy), along with a very well done ED. Both match the mood of the show very well (starting on a high note, ending more calmly and sweetly). The inclusion of the show's characters in the ED song is also a huge bonus from me!\\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Lucoa's Lack of Depth\\n\r\nThe character Quetzalcoatl, or Lucoa for short, begins the series as an interesting counterpart dragon to the rest. She comes off as a bit strange in busty appearance, but ultimately caring in her part-time role as Tohru's friend. Her guidance early on was a perfectly good character trait for her. However, later in the show she constantly boils down to either needing another dragon that isn't Fafnir, or full-on no thought boob humour. Don't get me wrong, I love sexual humour! But there was not a whole lot of \"comedy\" in how she was used in the show. This is an example of fanservice done badly.\\n\\n\r\n- Shouta's Inclusion\\n\r\nShouta as a character himself could be perfectly fine. He himself does nothing particularly wrong, and introducing magical beings other than dragons could provide a very interesting dynamic. However, none of that is explored as Shouta's one goal is to be the target of Lucoa's overt sexuality. Every single scene with him in it is either completely unnecessary to have him around, or it involves him running away from Lucoa's sexual advances. This could have been fine had the show decided to make her advances based on misunderstanding (she doesn't know why he's shy/embarrassed around her; He's intimidated by her overt sexuality), but instead it just comes off as creepy and unnecessary. There is one singular funny and unique moment for the duo in the show, but otherwise provide no additional value in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n- \"The Scene\"\\n\r\nThere is a scene about halfway through the show between Kanna and a human her age that has been well documented in its ridiculousness. I will not spoil anything related to it (you can do that research on your own), but I personally was a bit shocked at how far it went and how it pushed the boundaries. I don't think the idea was a ridiculous one; There was much comedy to be had in the circumstances. But in my opinion they went a bit too far in their pursuit for sexual humour, and if I had the choice I'd cut it a lot short than it was.\\n\\n\r\n- Kobayashi + Tohru Character Interaction\\n\r\nMany interactions between characters are incredibly well done and thought out, however arguably the biggest relationship of the entire show progresses at an absolutely sluggish pace. Kobayashi talks a good game about how things have changed dramatically, however it takes until the final few episodes before those words become visible actions and finally provide satisfying character progress between the two main characters. For a show that does such a good job with its other character progressions (Fafnir and Kanna as two examples), this one was slightly disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is a spectacularly made show let down by a few small gripes. It impressed me extraordinarily with its charm, its character design, its art, and many more aspects, all of which I would rate almost perfect. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for the show, it has a few weak points (mentioned above) that can be really crippling at times. Luckily, these weak points are far in the minority, so overall the show was still incredibly enjoyable and fun to watch. You can't make a memorable show without flying too close to the sun sometimes, so I won't fault it for trying a bunch of interesting ideas (most of which worked out). \\n\\n\r\nThe show otherwise shines brighter than many other shows I've seen, and while it might seem to stand out solely based on the whole \"dragon gimmick\", I can assure you that it is far from the only thing that makes this show stand out.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of slice of life, light comedy, cute dragons, or having your heart melt in various different ways, this is a show you will not want to miss.\\n\\n\r\nIf you find any kind of sexualization around unambiguously child-like characters unacceptable, there will be parts of this show that you will not like (as was the case with me). I would still recommend giving it a shot (as did I), as it is otherwise a tremendous product.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon. Honestly I was disappointed. The reviews and Gifs of this show made this out to be far more enjoyable than it actually was.\r\nThe story revolves around a dragon named Tooru, and her friend/savior Kobayashi. The start of the show we are introduced to both in a comical and crazy way. It appears to open into a slice of life show, with comical undertones with dragons learning the ways of humans. It also had some \"deeper\" connotations which might have been good if they kept feeding it to us like the first fewepisodes. However after about three episodes the show stops being about dragons and humans and becomes just about humans. The \"deeper\" moments also stop being dished out well, and are instead piled on at the end of the episodes like some cheap dressing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very pretty and well done, the soundtrack was really enjoyable as well. This is easily the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters start off interesting as well. Tooru is a dragon that can bring about Armageddon and has decided to live as a maid in Kobayashi's home. This is extra fun because she doesn't know what a maid is, in fact when asked she starts handing out pamphlets like you see in front of maid cafes. Kobayashi is basically a nerdy programmer girl who doesn't have anyone in her life outside of a co worker who also shares interests in maids. The clash of the hyper dragon and the \"old woman\" character in Kobayashi makes for some decent comedy and interesting setting.\\n\\n\r\nA few episodes into the show they introduce a few other dragons. Each dragon has a strong and vibrant personality and you can expect some hi jinks to happen. However once introductions are finished and the show becomes melodrama and loses all interesting characteristics. The dragon's integrating with humans stops being an issue until the last two episodes where in they do the typical cheesy dialogue happy ending. I mean why even bother making them dragons, it didn't add anything to the show. In fact the angle they are trying to take with the drama would have been easier to achieve with an orphan or a runaway. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to say I disliked the show. It took me a while to complete it because of the ending drama always killing my enthusiasm for the next episode. The show starts off unique and fun and turns into a mess because it tries to become two different things, and doesn't manage becoming either of them. For those of you looking for humor and cute scenes, there are a few but it doesn't deliver them as well as many shows in that genre. for those of you looking for an emotional show with decent dialogue and weighty scenes, it doesn't give you those. Honestly I would not recommend this show to people who are not fans of slice of life shows.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Not great. Theme switches early and becomes an episodic formula which is frankly boring. Usage of dragons doesn't seem to matter. Art and sound both fantastic, check out the soundtrack.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation produced this, which is fitting because this is a titillating moe time-waster, and if you want one of those polished to a mirror finish, accept no substitutes. You could stop the review there and score it a 4 or something, but this titillating moe time-waster has some of the most side-splittingly funny gags in comedy anime, and solid heartwarming themes of family and companionship that echo back to the Clannad series.\r\nThe flair for the ridiculous is almost like the manga author took a few pages out of Nichijou's book. \"OK, gotta go to work, and... uh, there's a dragon outside my door. Andshe turned into a maid with a tail and horns.\" There was maybe one episode (the skit) where the comedy was mostly lost on me.\\n\\n\r\nI like comedies where a character might seem like an evil villain but ultimately she's harmless, and with seemingly one exception Kobayashi-san's characters fill that bill. You see the full range of KyoAni's abilities when the dragons duke it out even at partial power, and watching them tone it down to \"Kobayashi's standard\" is a great running gag.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all raucous humor and boob jokes (and while there are several of the latter, this isn't High School DxD or Qwaser)-- Kobayashi talking the dragons into accepting modern Japanese society is the true power of this show. Kobayashi, of course, isn't exactly a model example of a head of household or anything, but she has a strong heart and is able to think on her feet. You really don't see that kind of woman character very often.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's weakness is story, as is the case with many shows like this. Most of the time it's \"Story? What story?\" until the final 2 episodes or so (\"Oh, right, that story!\"). Generally I don't consider this that much of a weakness in comedy, because usually I'm too busy laughing to care. It's like a Monty Python or a good SNL sketch.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I can watch Kanna pop her tail out of an electrical outlet all day.",

            "content": "Bless KyoAni for this cute masterpiece~!\r\nPut bluntly, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon did not exactly have a great story (although the story was linear and quite easy to follow) considering the fact that it's a slice-of-life anime. Nonetheless, the show truly deserves all the praise that it can get and more.\r\nThe art and animation (as expected of Kyoto Animation) is truly eye candy. The sounds and music (especially the opening) really stick to you and that's a good sign; it simply means that the songs are catchy and it livens up the atmosphere. Basically, upon hearing the opening, you'd instantly know that what's coming upis going to be an explosion of moe and all the cutesies and cuddlies.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing and lovable. Kobayashi's character development, specifically, is the cream of it all. I loved how she started off a loner and was living everyday life like a normal office person, but suddenly and abruptly changes forever because of this sweet and beautiful dragon girl. It's pretty simple if you think about it, but it's not the simplicity of it that matters. What matters is that you (as the audience) know how the characters felt and how they changed for the better. I think that is beautiful in itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's utterly adorable and enjoyable! (Points for Kanna-chan! She's unarguably the most curious, sweetest, and cutest character of this past season.)\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 9 out of 10",

            "content": "So everyone is writing about Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid, so I thought, I may as well write about it.\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is not a comedy anime, nor it tries to be. Don\u2019t be fooled by that comedy tag because it is not a comedy anime in any sense and If it is a comedy anime then it is pretty bad one. It is a moe-slice of life anime. So, what makes it tick?\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid works on two planes, first are characters and other is setting. It is an anime about characters interacting with the setting, which is not a new idea persay, everyone uses it but let us see how it works in Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid.\\n\\n\r\nNow as an anime Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid has nothing standing for it. It doesn\u2019t have a story, it doesn\u2019t have unique characters or does it have good world building for fantasy anime, but what it has is a unique premise on the paper at least and Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid uses its premise to its fullest. The show asks a simple thing. You have a maid dragon, right? then use her dragoness to its fullest. It doesn\u2019t hold back using its uniqueness in its premise, it doesn\u2019t drive towards normal but use it differentness in it highest possible capacity. That is why Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid stands out of all other \u201cunique\u201d anime that came before it. There is no lack of \u201cunique\u201d anime but the lack of using that unique to it fullest.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid doesn\u2019t shy away to mix and experiment. It mixes the genre so well that you couldn\u2019t even tell what genre is Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is, except the slice of life. Driving the show was a slice of life, a comedy with heavy yaoi undertones without any seriousness which I loved. Normally this subject is shipped with a huge baggage of seriousness but not here. While the tone of the show remains consistent but the last episode had a completely different tone that it felt like completely different anime altogether and that is saying something. It is not normal for anime to change its tone this way, but it gives us a very satisfying ending which could not have done otherwise. Which just say how experimenting this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said that Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is all about how characters interact with the setting(nearly everything is about that anyway). Anime provides very generic characters with generic traits but there is a difference that they are all dragons and because they are dragons they become unique characters. Even when they have generic trait they think different than a human, they are different than humans in every aspect of their thinking. You can see this from their day to day life with their human counterparts. Show simply take these generic dragon characters and puts them in human environment to see what happens, Which is the main appeal of Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is a simple anime about a cute human looking maid with dragons mind doing maid works in a dragon way.",

            "content": "Exactly what it looks like: otkau-bait, moe, generic medieval fantasy, and maids.  But it's so fun to watch!\r\nThe show's not going to change your world, it's not going to surprise you, but it's going to entertain you.  Nice characters do cute things and live together.  Beings from another world don't understand our Earth customs.  People who seem different find strange reasons to be friends, and people who seem like they're cut from the same mold find a reason to be friends that you didn't expect.\r\nWhen the world is more cynical and scared than ever before, when we're retreating behind our nationalborders, that's when we need shows like this to remind us that strange friendships are waiting for us, out there somewhere.  Shows that remind us that the best thing in the world is other people, even if--like Kobayashi--we aren't the best at expressing how we feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe good--it's pure unadulterated fun.  The OP and ED are fantastic (the OP is stupidly good).  The power of friendship.  The way Kobayashi is presented--someone who's suddenly realized that they're a serious adult, kind but not good at expressing it, mature in some ways but at other times not really prepared to be an adult.  Then again, maybe I just relate to her because I'm the same age, have the same job, living the same life, and have the same problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad--predictable.  The lesbian schoolgirl Rika and the oversexualized Quetzalcoatl are a bit too much, especially Quetzalcoatl.  If I never see another anime where characters have a conversation about breast size it wouldn't be too soon.\\n\\n\r\nOther notes--The final episode tries to extract a climax out of the source material, which works better than you'd expect.  It gives the series a good note to end on even though the series doesn't need a climax.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a pick-me-up in a world that seems a little too real, or a bit of fun after a long day of Python web development like Kobayashi, maybe thirteen episodes with a dragon maid are exactly what you need.",

            "content": "Small Spoilers About the Dragon's Characteristics\r\nSend Feedback if You Can\r\nChores. We all hate them. A part of our everyday lives, it takes us away from what we really want to do. We can't enjoy ourselves to the fullest because we are forced to look after ourselves and anyone else that lives with us. But what if we got a maid? Not just any old maid, but a dragon maid?\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is the story of how a dragon named Tohru was saved by Kobayashi, your everyday office worker. Feeling indebted to Kobayashi, Tohru becomes her maid, but the title kinda explains this already sothere wasn't really any use saying it all over again. The show simply follows the life of Kobayashi and Tohru as they try and adjust to their new life. With a few more dragons popping up, we watch as they all try to fit into the everyday lives of humans.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a pretty simple Slice of Life, each episode looking at the daily lives of Kobayashi and the other dragons. Usually, there is one big story per episode with a few gag scenes thrown in as transitions. It's quite a nice formula, and it allows for all the characters to get plenty of screen time throughout the series. The story doesn't really progress into anything until the final episodes, so it's really just a look at the antics of each character, which is where most of the comedy comes from, with a healthy dose of world building around the dragon's home.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real concrete formula for its comedy, as it changes its jokes a lot, only repeating a select few. It mainly focuses on the character roster and their interactions with humans and their environment. It's incredibly funny with the way it executes each joke, which is mostly unexpected excluding the few that get repeated a lot. At times it can also get quite serious, with important issues like the negative effects dragon's might have on the human world, but it doesn't force it into unneeded drama that loses its original meaning. Simply having it brought up allows us, as viewers, to think about it as well, creating a much bigger impact on us then forced drama would have done.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi is as normal as you get, except for her weird obsession with maids and butlers, but other than that she's pretty normal. You might assume that her personality might be boring, but it provides a wonderful contrast against the absurdity of dragons. She's basically a personification of how we would react if we were placed in the same situation. Her inner monologues also provide us with a look into character, thinking about how her life has been impacted by her new friends. It's so nice that the main character isn't some pussy teenage boy that we usually get with these group of supernatural characters anime.\\n\\n\r\nDragon Spoilers\\n\\n\r\nThe dragons are all great with their defining personalities. From the maid to the loli, each one seems to fall into a stereotype, but it proves us wrong as we get a deeper look into each character. Tohru worries about how long she'll be able to stay with Kobayashi, Kanna has family issues, Fafnir hates humans but decides to live with one, Quetzalcoatl (or Lucoa for short) is a fallen goddess, and Elma is technically the enemy. Instead of dwelling on these issues, it just gives a sense of personality and realism to most of these dragons, preventing them from being boring background characters. There are a few that just end up being part of the cast for the sake of having more characters, and the fanservice with some characters can get a little overbearing, so keep that in mind\\n\\n\r\nEnd of Dragon Spoilers\\n\\n\r\nWhat little drama is brought up focuses on Tohru's main issue, and it's done so well that instead of feeling forced it's actually quite heartwarming. Most Slice of Life animes end up created drama so it has a conclusive ending, usually ruining the show in the process, but Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid does it so well that it just slides in as just another episode, albeit a little emotional.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid just does everything so well. The comedy, characters, drama, it just fits together so perfectly that there are almost no faults in the series. I recommend it to everyone that wants a Slice of Life that's a little different from the rest.",

            "content": "Maid Dragon is a competently executed comedy/slice of life punctuated by standout moments of animated razzle dazzle. The show is, on the whole, pretty alright. \r\nUnfortunately, that's the show's biggest  sin. It's pretty alright... and that's about it.\r\nThis is an interesting counterpoint to another show from this past winter season, Kemono Friends, the low budget, abominably animated children's program about zoo animals turned into anthropomorphic girls. Where that show lacked in terms of flourish, Maid Dragon shines with aplomb. Granted, this is a KyoAni show, a certain level of visual fidelity is a given, but man is this show pretty. Despite the played-for-comedy mundanityof the premise, there are some sequences here that are just gorgeous. It's as if the studio is just showing off: a scene where two dragons play fight has visuals that could rival film productions. Throw in an OP/ED wombo combo of catchiness and you've got a show that excels aesthetically.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all surface level, though. A show like Kemono Friends drew in viewers because it had heart; it oozes with a passion that's endearing and infectious. Maid Dragon, on the other hand, feels a bit more hollow and thin. I wouldn't say the show is soulless, but it's thinner than a communion wafer and less fulfilling on both a spiritual and carnal level.\\n\\n\r\nThe eponymous Kobayashi and Tohru are decent as vehicles for the premise, Kanna's cute, Lucoa is best girl, and Fafnir is Jotaro Kujo as a NEET power gamer shut in dragon, which I appreciate, but there's not much to them beyond that. Elma is added late and leaves little impression. Saikawa and Shouta have one joke that gets repeated over... and over... and over again, without much in the way of subversion or wit.\\n\\n\r\nI don't even mind the subject matter of the jokes (grade school lesbians and /ss/), but at least give me a little variety.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not even that the jokes are all bad or that I never laughed, a few really good setups found their way in, but it's all pretty predictable after a certain point. The show makes a few attempts at pathos and while it's appreciated, it never feels like the characters have much room to grow after the first few episodes. It's a shame, too, because a show like K-On! shows that the studio is clearly capable of making something meaningful out of a SOL premise, but they just didn't bother here. Maybe they didn't try.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the effort that went into the look of the show, everything else fell by the wayside. This isn't to say that Maid Dragon is bad, but it's only serviceable. KyoAni hit all the notes it had to and not a single note more. Maid Dragon is a decent watch as long as it's on, but there's nothing to think about or chew over after the credits have rolled. I won't say don't watch it, but this is the sort of program you save for when you have time to kill and you want something light, breezy, and ultimately insubstantial. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, for better or worse, Maid Dragon is filler for life. If that's what you're looking for, you could do worse. After all, it's pretty alright.",

Bless you, KyoAni, for creating something so fun and enjoyable to watch to kick off 2017.\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon stars Kobayashi, a hard-working stoic programmer who happens to find a dragon out in the middle of forest while she happened to be drunk from a night of drinking heavily. The next morning when she goes off for work, she's greeted by the same intimidating dragon at her doorstep!? And what's more, the dragon then changesinto a girl, who begs to be a maid for Kobayashi herself!? Meet Tohru (Tooru), the energetic maid dragon.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets this show apart from other Slice of Life/Comedy shows is that it's really earnest and just gives off a warm, happy feeling. It doesn't try too hard to make you want to watch and love it, and laugh at some of the comedy it shows. All the characters you meet are entertaining in their own right, some of which coming with their own running joke. Watching Tohru try so hard to be the best maid she can for Kobayashi gives the same feeling of watching anybody learn to do something for the first time and seeing them trying their best at it. It's a good, warm, fluffy feeling on the inside. Kanna is a young but smart dragon who also lives with Kobayashi and Tohru. In the human world, she goes to elementary school and learns like any other student, yet befriends the person who all would say is stuck-up and rude. With an upbeat OP and catchy ED, this show immediately catches the hearts of many. KyoAni even teases us at some point by showing off this brilliant and extremely detailed 30 second fight scene, just to say \"We can still do this.\" \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: While showing a cute and upbeat setting, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is an endearing and heartwarming show of dragons learning to live in the human world. A world class show in its own right (+1 if you get the in-joke), this show won't fail to make you smile and love it the entire way through.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animations has been a studio that I've enjoyed over the time I got into anime, producing cute animations but yet with a different tone like Hyouka, Chyuunibyou, and Nichijou. But over the time I felt as though I've seen enough of what they have to offer *cough* phantom world *cough*, but then somewhere over the clouds, Kyoto Animations said \"we ain't done yet\" and they just threw a fucking meteor at us with the power of a thousand suns, and that meteor was \"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid\". The story is about Kobayashi with her normal life in West Philadelphia, when suddenly a kawaii sugoi dragondecides to become her maid because they were playing duck, duck, goose and the dragon lady lost. Oh yeah and there's also other dragons.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm finish with a reminder on the show's plot, lets get serious. I don't love it nor do I hate it. It sits in a special place in the anime world of it's good but there's a recurring flaw in that show, like with main stream anime and their fillers. Miss Kobayashi has a cute premise, an everyday life but with dragons trying to fit in with human society, which is fine if it didn't have one problem. There's too much fan-service. Ranging in a scale of bouncing tits to THICC parts of a human body being noticeable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about random parts in life, so you can say there's no main plot in general, which I'm fine with since I really enjoyed Nichijou. The art style is very cute but it's a obvious coming from K.A. I enjoy the music, especially the opening- my God do I love jamming out to that shit. Now the critical view with the characters. I find each character unique, ranging in different personalities, but I can't seem to enjoy the show when it goes to a boy running with a dragon with BOUNCING BOOBIES!!! Don't get me wrong, I love fan-service but if it's done right, it just feels out of place in a world of Kobayashi. I don't let it bother me as much as others, I just view as some points to be dragons adopting in to human life.\\n\\n\r\n(This part has nothing to do with the review, but it's a rant)\\n\r\nI really hate on how Kanna is viewed to people. Yes the scenes with her and Saikawa are a bit odd but you have to understand, Kanna is a dragon. She doesn't know life as a human unless it's about them killing dragons. She views life in a different matter like people with autism. So next time you see something weird with the kid dragon just understand that she doesn't know about human society and how they interact. Unless if it's porn. Jesus fucking Christ stop lewdING HER MY FU-\\n\\n\r\nI give Kobayashi's Dragon Maid a 7.5/10",

            "content": "This is a hard review to write because I want to be objective but at the same time I absolutely love this series so much that it's difficult to remain impartial. I will do my best. There are spoilers below, so...do what you will.\r\nKobayashi is by far the character I can most relate to in all of anime/manga. As someone who has slaved away for the past 30 years in the high tech industry and never ventured very far out of my introverted shell, I am Kobayashi. And the thing that is really underappreciated about Kobayashi's character is that it's not that she particularly lovesher job or feels that she's changing the world through her work - it's just that work is all she has. That's it. She's good at her job, people rely on her, but that is her entire life. For anyone out there that is really good at their job and spends all their time working because they're not good at anything else, you can relate, right? \\n\\n\r\nThe later episode that goes into more detail on the night Kobayashi meets Tooru in the woods actually brought a tear to my eye. Not because it was touching, but because of the way Kobayashi is mistreated by her boss, works herself to death to shut him up, then goes out and gets completely wasted by herself to numb the pain. She's so wasted she thinks it's funny that she misses her train stop and gets lost in the middle of nowhere, not because it's actually funny, but because at that point there's nothing she can do but laugh at how sad her life is. And, hey! May as well buy another giant bottle of sake and go wander home by herself, right! I have been there many times. \\n\\n\r\nKobayashi's loneliness is pretty much incurable because she doesn't know how to relate to other people. She *would* like to have friends and family relationships but just can't bring herself to open herself up to it. This is her primary internal conflict: she both wants and simulteaneously abhors relationships with others. So she just does nothing but work, and work, and work.\\n\\n\r\nTooru is conflicted in a similar way. As a dragon in the \"other world\" she hates humans as her mortal enemy. However, in reality she is a kind-hearted dragon deep down inside. But for all her power, she is also incapable of obtaining the one thing she desires with all her heart - a loving relationship. When she meets Kobayashi, Tooru recognizes that Kobayashi needs someone, and decides that someone is her. If I have any advice for the introverted, lonely people out there - find someone that loves you the the way that Tooru loves Kobayashi. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Kobayashi's transformation over the series is absolutely heart-warming. I was literally choking up in SPOILERS the episode where Kanna asks her to come to sports day. Kobayashi is initially resistant because sports day falls on a work deadline, but seeing Kanna's disappointment she decides to work extra hard to finish early so she can be there for Kanna. The other episode that really tugs at the heart strings is the one where the dragons and kids put on the holiday show for the folks at the old folks home. Kobayashi is initially worried the dragons are overdoing it, but by the end she is just as enchanted as the rest of the audience. When Kobayashi pets Tooru on the head and praises her for doing a good job without Tooru having to ask first - it's a nut punch in the feels.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if your heart doesn't absolutely melt when you see Kobayashi fighting a giant scary dragon over whether Torru stays with her or goes back, you really need to take a deep look inside the dark empty husk of a human you are to see if you have any feelings at all. Side note: I was so happy to see the OAV with the scene where Torru confesses her love for Kobayashi, and Kobayashi accepts....so adorable. \"Shall we breed now\" is my new catchphrase.\\n\\n\r\nAt times hilarious, heart-breaking, and touching with a worthy cast of supporting characters - of course Kanna is everyone's favorite, but the rest of the dragons are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSpectacularly animated, voice acting on point, well-written beyond belief, and the deep dives into the lives of dragons make this a can't miss series. \\n\\n\r\n[edit] by the way, for all the reviews hating on this because the way the relationships are depicted between adults and children - it's a parody of these tropes, people. It is not dramatized unironically. If you take these things literally, you are the butt of the joke...",

            "content": "Between being a fan of the writer and the studio, it's safe to say Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is the biggest disappointment of an anime I've ever personally had the displeasure of being exposed to. \r\nTooru is a dragon maid. Let that sink in for a moment. She is a maid who is also a dragon. It's in the title. It's brought up in the first episode. And then... it honestly rarely comes up that much again except for rehashing the same old gags. Instead of anything to do with worldbuilding or her dragon-like aspects, Tooru's main personality trait is her creepy-level obsession with Kobayashi.By the third episode, this behavior has lost all of its charm and is just boring and annoying to have to rehash. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, or so it would seem at first, the show realizes this is getting old and decides to bring in a variety of other characters. The best episode is the first one after our second dragon is introduced - it's more cute and charming and fun than any episodes that actually center around the main characters. Unfortunately, the next episode after that decides to take this character and use her as a method to sexualize ELEMENTARY-AGE GIRLS in a way that made me feel physically ill. \\n\\n\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a show that goes from annoying and boring to absolute moral train wreck in 10 seconds flat. Sadly, its popularity says a lot about how anime can continue to get away with scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel.",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a comedy, slice of life, fantasy anime that aired in Winter 2017 from Jan 12 2017 to April 6th 2017. I have quite literally just finished the anime and I am writing this review as I type(which is obvious). To quickly sum up the show, we follow the life of Kobayashi who is an female working adult who is now living with Tohru, a dragon now a maid for Kobayashi herself. Hence the show\u2019s title. My initial impression of the anime was very low as I expected it to be a harem with all these female characters andheaps of fanservice. How very wrong I was. I loved this anime. I think what this anime executed very well was the sense of family and friendship like no other. This is especially true with Tohru and Kobayashi. The relationship between these characters is evolving throughout the anime was a pleasure to watch as well as the relationship with another character called Kanna. Kanna has a daughter to mother relationship with Kobayashi and sister-sister to Tohru, even though she is also a dragon too with no relation to either of these characters by blood. While people say that you can only get unconditional love from your parents, I feel that this anime proves as testament against that fact. The opening song for the anime is lovely to listen to and full of life which just symbolises everything about the anime. The animation is excellent. It\u2019s colourful and bright and the art style really appeals to me especially with the fantasy elements in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnother theme that this anime explores is understanding that while every person is different to one another, we can still respect each other\u2019s morals,values and perspective on the world. We can still love one another as for what we are and not change ourselves just because we are told to but because we want to. This is evident with Tohru\u2019s transition from a dragon to a human and living with Kobayashi. This theme is recurring in the anime quite a lot especially when we are looking at this from Tohru and Kobayashi\u2019s perspectives or just the interaction between the two characters.\\n\r\nKyoto Animation really hit the nail in the head with the characters. Firstly, Kobayashi the working adult without any happiness in her life except the monotonous cycle of her programming job. Tohru, the dragon-maid trying to find a purpose in this new world after leaving hers. Kanna, a dragon who is essentially a child needing love for which she didn\u2019t get. The other supporting characters are generally good too, my favourite being Fafnir-san. He\u2019s just great even though cliched. Only question is that what does Lucoa exactly do???\\n\\n\r\nOn the note of fan-service, there was definitely some in the anime, but it\u2019s something I could easily look over and not get distracted because the anime is great otherwise. Unlike 2011-12 me, which would have been absolutely bewildered by this being new to anime.\\n\r\nI like slice of life anime especially like Barakamon which is just up there, but I have to put this as my favourite slice of life anime that I have watched. No it\u2019s not perfect and yes I am biased because of the emotional attachment I have to this anime. I\u2019m not a happy person, but this made me smile so often and sad too in emotional scenes. I have not enjoyed an experience like this in a such a while. This is up there in my top anime list and I have to give this anime a 9/10.\\n",

I mean we already had the fill of that supernatural-moe kind of anime and dragons were like an ancient element even before but the thing with this anime is that its \"ordinariness\" is what it makes it \"unique\" and \"a gem\". I like how they included in real life scenarios and conflicts that they solved with calm and mature resolutions. And the characters too, there's a character development at each ep. I bet the manga would also be a fun read too.\r\nSo, if you're looking for a light yet enjoyable and relaxing to watch kind of anime, I highly recommendthat you should check this out. Just a sight from kanna is more than enough to make your stress go. I swear she'll make you go \"kyaaa\" >////<)b\\n\\n\r\nTbh, I skipped this anime last year thinking that it's again another \"moe-filled-with-fanservice-and-annoying-lolis\" kind of anime and those aren't my cup of tea. I also heard like biased reviews and some are bad reviews about this but I knew kanna even before--cause well, she's really popular and adorable. And I didn't even marked it as bookmarked or even PTW. I guess that's one of my regrets last year. When my guy friend recommended me this, I got interested. Partly because he recommended it and also, kanna lol I said \"Alright, I'll watch it for kanna. I heard that it has some yuri undertones in it too.\" Well. I wasn't wrong but damn. It's like another gakkougurashi again. It's somehow surprised me. I didn't thought that I'll enjoy it this much that it made me rewatch again and it got me to anime once again too. So I guess, I'm off to weebing again this year xd",

(As a note, I listenedto some clips that compared both dubbed and subtitled versions and Tohru's voice in both are remarkably similar)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI liked their characterizations, they were quite enjoyable to watch, albeit cheesy at times, but it is a silly show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nLike I said, at first I though it was weird, but I couldn't stop watching it and I really enjoyed it.\\n",

While the nonsensical plot jumping from storyline to storyline can be difficult for people who are not use to it, the creators do it great here. The humor was great because of the situations they were able to make while being clever about it. I particularly like the small fourth wall breaks they make that demonstrate how much the creators care. This was definitely worth watching, although it had medium bingibility. This is definitely worth the time. Great humor, great characters, and the subtleties throughout just make it so much better",

            "content": "I really like this anime. \"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid\"(MKDM) expresses some meaningful and heartfelt ideas but does it while making you laugh. It's light hearted and fun throughout the series and you don't feel weighed down by any drama or edge-of-your-seat action. Don't get me wrong, I like drama and action but sometimes it's nice to just laugh. In that respect it reminds me of shows like \"Lucky Star\" or \"My Bride is a Mermaid\" except with a bit more depth. Also like \"Lucky Star\" and most of \"My Bride is a Mermaid\" each episode is self contained with only one \"to be continued\" atthe very end. I like that I can watch it and not feel like I have to do a marathon viewing to reach some kind of conclusion. It's one of those shows that are great to watch after a long day to lift your spirits.\\n\r\nAnother thing I like is MKDM's unique quirkiness. It may have some typical character tropes and ideas that have been used before but it throws it together in a distinctly different fashion. Kobayashi in particular is idiosyncratic. I don't recall seeing a character quite like her in a lead role and her attitude and approach has its own special twist to it. Originality that actually works and doesn't go too far into the deep end is rare but MKDM, I think, manages to squeeze some in.\\n\r\nI feel I should mention that I watched the English dubbed version which I thought was really good. The actors did a great job and the script was adapted well to English. Tooru and Kobayashi use the funny and straight man (or woman in this case) trope and the humor would fall pretty flat if the lines weren't delivered right, but I thought the actors nailed it.",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid has easily been the most surprising series all around. From episode 1 I was hooked, and now that the series is over, I am very sad. You see, if I\u2019m being honest here, this is one of the first new anime I\u2019ve loved, truly loved since\u2026 I wanna say Attack on Titan which came out in 2013. Now I do want to say that this series may not be as good as a lot of anime out these days, but the fact that for me it came out of nowhere and told an incredible funny, entertaining, lighthearted story in just ashort 13 episodes. So thank you once again to Megumin for recommending me this anime in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe fact this anime exists and has the plot it has, the characters, the art style while telling a somewhat deep story about people who are in this fantasy world where dragons can go to and fro from their world and the humans realm, well that\u2019s an accomplishment, one that should never be forgotten. It got me to care about Kobayashi, a boring human character in a series full of colorful, cute, magical and destructive dragons. And it also got me to care more or less about most of the dragons that only have a minor role in the series, for example the series has these two secondary characters with no real worth to the main story line, Kanna and Elma. Now they both have their own kind of storylines if you can call them that, but they\u2019re for the most part segregated to one role. And these roles are more or less there to at most just help the story move forward. Normally these are characters I don\u2019t care about, Why? Because they usually have no personality outside of the generic, basic one. An example of this in something popular is Chiaotzu from Dragon Ball Z, the little guy is completely useless and has no character, and because of that I have no real connection to that character. But this series makes me care about Elma and Kanna, and Elma is featured even less than Kanna is, to the point of where I question her role, and honestly can\u2019t remember if she had one, which is a gripe of these secondary character too, they have no meaningful use in the series. But we\u2019ll get into that in a moment, back to my point, Kanna and Elma, and even the whole weird Quetzalcoatl and Shuto thing, I care about it, which is hard for me to say about some things these day, especially slice of life series filled with cute dragon girls. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying before, the secondary characters seem to have no use. Quetzalcoatl is the absolutely most useless and questionable addition to the cast, and the same goes for Elma. Now their parts are funny, and they\u2019re adorable segments sometimes, but what really is the point I ask myself, as a writer, I could have found ways to get these scenes in with less characters and make more sense in some points. Now this is really nitpick, as it works for the show, but it felt like a kind of Prometheus syndrome kind of moment, where in the moment it was great, but you think about it for a minute and it felt unnecessary. This is probably the one major thing I found from this series that I found as a problem. And even then, it really won\u2019t harm your viewing experience, and it shouldn't, the show is written well enough to let you not think about these things until after viewing. \\n\\n\r\nNext up I want to talk about how great the story is in just 13 episodes. The whole series is simple, and has a story that feel genuine and real even though\u2026 it\u2019s an anime. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve watched an anime like this, as it\u2019s not often I do, especially anime involving tropes like this. It\u2019s just a well made anime from top to bottom. The things I most enjoy about it has to be the characters interactions with each other. It feels natural for the series, and in no way shape or form does it feel like it\u2019s a chore to see these characters interact. I enjoyed Elma interacting with Kobayashi while Tohru didn\u2019t exactly like them interacting too much. I also licked how, for some reason, there was this recurring joke that Tohru wanted Kobayashi to eat her tail. It was just a little bit of dark comedy, but I found it blended well with the show in every way. Of course Tohru would want to do that, she\u2019s Tohru. You have moments like these in the show a lot, which is a testament to how well the characters are written. After they\u2019re introduced we simply just know who and what they are, and that\u2019s a side effect of using tropes and archetypes to your advantage. I like to use this test, would I want a poster of, let\u2019s say Tohru on my wall. If I do, then that means the series has captured not only my money, but my interest and shows they wrote a character well. And yeah, I\u2019d totally put up a poster of Tohru on my wall.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nProbably some of the best animation I\u2019ve seen this whole year, and we\u2019re not even halfway through it. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid has easily the most accessible art direction of an anime I\u2019ve seen this year. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s colorful and it\u2019s cute. You can\u2019t tell me Kobayashi isn\u2019t a cool design for a character that fits her personality and harkens back to a different time in anime. And I also feel the designs for the dragons are great as well, including both versions of their human forms. But also the human character are good too, I think you can\u2019t count that them out. The show basically just goes over the top with character designs and it works for every character. The reason is because the show is ridiculous fun from top to bottom. \\n\\n\r\nAlright let\u2019s not forget about something else that a lot of people noticed. The awesome ass animation for the fighting scene! How could anyone forget? They\u2019re easily the best the show has animation wise, it\u2019s epic. In fact, I think it\u2019s so good that I wouldn\u2019t be mad if they made a spinoff series where Dragon girls fight each other, and specifically Dragon girls, because Dragons fighting are cool, but the animation doesn\u2019t make their Dragon forms stand-out too much in battle for me. I think the human forms for the Dragon girls are the way to go in a series like that. It\u2019s just really well animated in this portions of the show and a lot of people agree with me they want a show using this same art style and animation team making awesome fight scenes against Tohru and Kanna.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dub\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just going to say this now, I think the English Dub is 100% better than the Japanese Dub. The voices in the english version capture the Japanese version completely, and the only time I don\u2019t see that is the voice actors for Quetz, but even then it\u2019s still an amazing actor voicing her. Other than that, Tohru, Kanna and Kobayashi are casted perfectly, they match the tone and inflection to the original Japanese version, and I think make improvements on it. Not some of you may disagree with that statement, but I feel that the shows comedy helps make that happen. It\u2019s comedy that American to British audiences and understand and enjoy, so when they go to voice act it, it feels natural and easy. There aren't a lot of puns, there isn\u2019t a lot of culture shock involved in the script. Because of this I think it\u2019s in my top 10 of English Dubs ever, and I am very confident in saying that.\\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nThe score for Dragon Maid is also pretty solid, probably not a soundtrack you\u2019d buy and OST for, at least for me. But I think personally it's a score that compliments the comedy really well. I noticed it a couple times specifically during the Sport Themed episode, which was amazing anyways, but the score there really sold some moments for me. Also another great episode is I think the episode where I think Kanna and Tohru fight each other in an epic battle that rivals some Dragon Ball Z episodes. The score in that episode really sold how powerful these Dragons are, and how they can destroy anything in seconds. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is easily the best anime of the season, and will go down as one of the funniest and cute shows of the year. The animation is perfect, the score is great, and the English Dub is the best I\u2019ve seem in a long time, rivaling some of the best dubs out there. But the show really glows when it comes to the story and the characters, making the audience care for super powerful Dragons that could easily destroy anything. Even when there is no main villain or goal, it creates characters you root for and want to see succeed. Miss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid is an example of masterful execution of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi\u2019s Dragon Maid gets a 8/10\\n",

            "content": "I am very late in reviewing this animation mainly because I had only heard about it from a random source and thought nothing of it at first. I am not normally a person who watches anime (animations out of artistic respect and courtesy) although I have watched plenty as a child. Now grown up I have become more picky and selective with my time and being a huge gamer, college student and worker I almost never watch shows anymore save for a few. So it speaks volumes that as an \"outsider\" I can say this show was one of the best and unexpected surprises forme in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the daily sitcom style that many attribute as \"slice of life\" that focuses more on the characters instead of the plot. While this already can be a dealbreaker for some, the characters (mostly) keep the show great and increasing in emotion as it leads to a finale so much so that I think it's almost a none issue. The dragons that act as humans in a modern setting is a clear sort of parody to the quirky and odd that animation seems so engraved to have in that it almost doesn't work for the show. There is some sexual stuff that happens (not all in good taste) and some moments don't shine as they should, but the majority of the time there is so much energy and spirit put into the main characters like Tohru, Kobayashi and Kanna that I was sold by episode 2 for the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nAs a critic for games and films, I tend to see animation on a art level that can give the viewer some sort of message to take away from, regardless of how unrealistic it could be. With dragons as women and men with all sorts of vibrancy that screams \"been there, done that\" with countless shows before it, it's honestly refreshing to see this energetic cast take off to keep my attention. The pacing can sometimes be a bit too fast for jokes to land a hit, but I was ranging from chuckles to laughter when I caught onto the subtle even deadpan delivery by the characters. As a comedy, it retains a high quality of humor that uses gags effectively by cleverly redesigning the buildup so it remains fresh. How long before they stale entirely is uncertain, but the gags currently all work fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is superb with voicework of Tohru, Kanna and Kobayashi all deserve particular praise. Despite the comedy and energetic vibrancy the show gives, there is also a really precious theme swimming through its veins. It's a show that made me smile, even sometimes tear up on how beautiful things can be when portrayed through a medium such as animation. The best part I think of that is only the viewer will only know that warm feeling you get when you see certain scenes happen. It's a personal commitment that rewards the viewer as much as those on screen. The pacing is great with no setbacks or overuse of filler that wastes the potential of the characters. The music (as it is subjective as much as comedy) is very alluring. The opening is initially simple, but grows to be far more emotional and deep as you progress through each episode and the closing is silly yet charming.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a great deal. I was enthralled by the artwork of the characters and dialogue. The finale filled me with tears and was near flawless in its execution. The need for a second season is critical as I feel some of the criticisms of certain characters need to be explained more so it can further their appeal. Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid deserves acclaim for it's accomplishments in sticking to a formula used often and throws a completely random and yet clever twist that works to the show's strengths. As I mentioned, I might not watch much animation as I use to, but with a much better understanding of art, critique and analyzing, there is no doubt that this show is a winner in my books. Watch it if you want a happy, funny and emotional time that is straight to the point and pulls off the surface level facades anyone might have when looking at this for the first time.",

It's bouncy and energetic but also sweet and cathartic. This show's premise is a masterful balancing act between fantasy and normality. The fantasy aspect is emphasized just enough to give the characters and their daily interactions a bit of flair and intrigue, but not so much that it alienates the audience or shatters the happy-go-lucky mood of the show. It amazes me how well Kobayashi is able to grab your attention and not let go. Once the ball startsrolling in an episode, you're strapped in for good. You're sucked into the colorful and bouncy world of Kobayashi San-chi no Maid Dragon. It's funny, witty, sometimes profound, and is always a blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I cannot praise Kobayashi enough for is that it knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do; it never needlessly introduce melodrama or angst. Once in a while, the show will purposefully sneak in a serious but heartwarming moment or subtle life lesson, adding variety and depth to its message. These somber moments are sparse, ephemeral, and sweet, and I'm impressed by how well this show handles this aspect of its storytelling: it acknowledges the fact that life is not all fun and games, but while the fun lasts, make the most of it. It knows how to move on and return to its roots as a slice-of-life comedy with lovable and unique characters.  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the comedy in this show (or any show) might be a hit or miss depending on the person. To me, it was a bullseye. Kobayashi's set-up and delivery of punchlines is textbook and effective. There is always a certain amount of wit and cleverness in each joke, and rarely do they feel cheesy nor over-the-top. It also helps that the show does a great job of mixing up its premise, setting, and characters every other scene, and even after 13 episodes the comedy still  manages to stay fresh and interesting for the most part, something which cannot be said for a shit ton of other shows. \\n\\n\r\ntldr:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a lighthearted slice-of-life anime to relax to, Kobayashi san-chi no Maid Dragon is as good as it will get.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nFor someone who has watched enough slice-of-life shows to make 5 whole lives, I can say that Kobayashi is one of the most colorful and gratuitously animated slice-of-life shows I've seen. Kyoto Animation abused the fuck out of their animation budget as usual, and as a result we get a product that's on par with god memes like Nichijou. Each and every character design is visually distinct and interesting. Intense battle scenes, while sparse, are packed with absurd sakuga and CG. The color palette, while extremely vibrant, is pleasant and not overwhelming to the eyes like No Game No Life. \\n\r\nOverall, I don't think I can fault Kobayashi with anything in the art design and animation department.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is above average. The OP is adequate but the ED is surprisingly catchy. The background tracks are fitting and relaxing but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n10/10 sheer entertainment value\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "This is a surprisingly well done anime, that has a sweet and somewhat melancholic, but comedic tone. Its mood is somewhat similar to Non Non Biyori and to a lesser extent, to the titles like Kono Suba, and maybe even Minami-ke and Azumanga. It is a relaxed slice-of likfe kind of anime with magical elements played mostly for comedy purposes. Simple, but likeable characters and graphic style. It is much calmer than Kono Suba, is not as surreal as Azumanga, and somewhat more energetic than Non Non Biyori.\r\nI recommend to watch it.\r\nDetailed breakdown:\r\nStory: 7/10:\r\nIt uses occasional cliches here and there, but overall it has relaxedfeeling to it. The anime is more or less episodic, where the episodes do not follow each other in a very strict order, meaning even though there's a big overarching arc (which is not strongly pronounced), and things happen in order, individual episodes are close to being independentn.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10:\\n\r\nArt is  relatively low-detail, but stylish. Visuals are more on a \"cuter\" style, and somewhat resemble visuals of titles like azumanga... maybe even more detailed than azumanga. Backrounds are done well, there's a bit of CG here and there for objects, but scenes are drawn with attention to detail, and certain individual shots are quite well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe surprising thing is that dragons are hand drawn and are not CG, which makes the anime more \"alive\".\\n\\n\r\nSouind: 6/10:\\n\r\nSolid work which complements the overall atmosphere well, but I wouldn't call it outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10:\\n\r\nThey're simplisitc and stereotypical, but they work very well, and are quite likeable. The interesting thing is that the anime has unusual protagonist - girl programmer that is not in a school. There's also an almost complete clone of Renge from Non Non Biyori running around, but she is amunsg anyway. Despite comedic nature of the show, interactions between characters often feel sincere and believable. \\n\\n\r\nWell, there are couple of gag characters that are not deeply portrayed, but main characters are well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nI liked it. I expected something cheap and simple, but was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nI recommend to watch it. The anime is very well done, light, funny and heartwarming, without many dramatic events. It is perfect in order to relax/unwind. It will also work well if you like slice of life. It doesn't have ton of fanservice in it (there are some risque jokes, though, and certain character that could be considered to be fanservicey), and overall its atmosphere really reminded me of Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end: recommended.",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi's dragon maid was not only my favorite of the Winter 2017 season, but one of my favorite anime of all time. Like, top three. That's how much I adored this anime.\r\nSTORY: With a plot that sounded silly to most at first glance, including myself, it ended up being so much more than I expected. When I first heard about this anime, I remember rolling my eyes and thinking, \"Really? A maid who's also a dragon? They're running out of ideas...\" Well, I've never eaten my own words so quickly. Something that looks so comedic and light-hearted at first has completely serious, solemn andtouching moments that left me in awe. It's a story that builds upon itself, seeming simple and maybe ridiculous to some in the first episode to becoming something so touching and great by the end of the series. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: Kyoto animation went in for this series, that's for sure! With gorgeous character designs (seriously, I could go on and on about how much I adore Kobayashi's and the dragon's designs.) that make such distinct and amazing looking characters, to some fantastic animation that never disappointed or took the lazy road. Even the backgrounds are great, having an almost watercolor feel to them. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: One of the strongest aspects of an already strong anime. There's Kobayashi, a deadpan businesswoman who has trouble expressing herself and her feelings, and then Tooru, the dragon who can be just as silly as she can be solemn and cold-blooded. Tooru and Kobayashi definitely stole the show, but that doesn't mean the other characters are something to scoff at. All brimming with personality and gorgeous designs, there's not a character in this anime I just didn't like. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Perfect. The voice acting more than gets the point across, and each voice fits each character to a T. The op/ed are both stellar, too. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I waited impatiently every Wednesday this anime came out, refreshing the page until the new episode arrived because of how much I looked forward to more of this anime. Just seeing Kobayashi and Tooru's interactions were more than enough to make me happy, and seeing the opening still puts me in a good mood. It has this tone that just....gives you a warm feeling and puts a smile on your face. I loved every second of this anime. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nTooru and Kobayashi's relationship: One of my absolute favorite things about this anime is how...up front they were about Tooru's feelings for Kobayashi. Hell, even actual shoujo-ai anime beat around the bush more than this anime did. From the very first episode, Tooru is completely honest about her romantic and sexual attraction towards Kobayashi. Most of the drive Tooru has in this series is BECAUSE of her love for Kobayashi, and just seeing her utter adoration for her warmed my heart and made me smile, no matter how bad a mood I was in. I really dunno how anyone could deny Tooru's feelings or make them purely platonic, because they're really not, and I adore how the anime does nothing to hide that. 100000/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one of my all time favorites and something I will remember for a long, long time. It has this warm tone to it that makes the person watching it feel good and happy, coupled with fantastic art to make this anime really something special. I adore it to pieces, and cannot wait for the OVA in September :DD. 10/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The slice of life/comedy genre today seems to have set parameters. The only requirements include a group of young females doing cute things, a school setting, and a few gags here and there. I understand the target audience is young adults grinding through the education system. But what if there was an anime about a middle class woman, who by sheer coincidence persuades a dragon from another dimension to be her maid? A dragon harboring hatred toward humans. Committing Armageddon would be a trivial feat for this mythical creature. However the time spent with the proclaimed \"inferior species\" changes her perception into something a bitmore positive. Did I mention her friend is a dragon goth-loli who can control electricity? Sounds a bit far fetched right? Welcome to Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon.\\n\\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey my feelings concisely when an abstract story is delivered in such a relate-able manner. There will be countless moments of impulsive laughter followed by heart warming joy. It's the kind of anime that will put a grin on your face each and every episode without fail. It will portray a perspective that you may have taken for granted, overlooked, or even are currently experiencing without a second thought. Such as being overworked to the point where even your boss is making you do his/her share. Having a close friend to grab drinks with after a long day. Arriving home to a warm welcome or even just having a place to belong. This anime has made me appreciate every relationship, every encounter, around me so much more. Because while there are some things that will never change, nothing stays the same forever.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the story revolves around Kobayashi living her daily routine accompanied by her unusual maid Tooru. Throughout the series Kobayahsi attempts to educate Tooru the rules of being a proper maid as well as the guidelines of living as a human in the 21st century. This results in a handful of hilarious moments but more importantly helps the two experience something they never have previously. Such as having a place to belong or simply feeling appreciation towards someones company. Now don't take this the wrong way. This is not a suspenseful story that will bring you to tears. It is purely a goofy comedy with adorable characters in a relaxing atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe ironic thing is the anime's story rather mediocre! However most slice of life/comedy anime are similar in this manner. What really counts are the characters and how they interact with each other. With that being said I would like to give credit where credit is due. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon has some of the most relate-able characters in any anime I have seen to date. Not to mention the art style graciously compliments the simple but functional aspects that make this series so attractive. With animation so smooth even battle scenes seem as though they derived straight from top tier action anime. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is a perfect example of a slice of life/comedy done right. Relate-able characters, heartwarming relationships, and a storm of laughter. While dragons and maids may not be the stereotypical idea of a heartwarming story. I can guarantee this step outside of the box will result in a more than gratifying experience.",

            "content": "Ok, let's be honest here and say that most of us who aren't into Slice of Life anime (like myself) came to watch this because of all the attention and memes surrounding this show. It's kinda hard not to take notice to a show that get that much attention (even if it's centered around one character and their design). So I'm just going to get this out of the way right now and mention that this review is going to be from the perspective of somebody who can't get into this genre very well, so if the score is lower then you would think itshould get because if I was a fan I'd think a lot different, then mentally tack on a point and a half for genre bias. I'm just going to give it to yea as humbly and objectively as I can.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThis section alone is usually what really kills shows like this for me since they aren't really aimed down a particular path; the end goal could literally be anything and you wouldn't know it till it happens (which is usually the last episode or two). So for action anime fans, like myself, this would seem like a waste of time since every episode feels like filler. That's literally the barrier keeping us from enjoying it. The fact we expect the episodes to flow along with each other like a narrative and not like a montage reel.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough here it feels different. The narrative is not simply follow a character as they live their life, but instead it's follow a character as they try to live their life while *blank*. The adventure is in the high-jinxs that come from the abnormality. This in turn makes each episode feel more enjoyable to watch even if one of them is centered around an elementary school field day. Seriously, have you ever been dragged to an event for a younger sibling simply because they are apart of it? And no matter what it is, you are just trying your hardest to not let the fact you would rather be doing literally anything else show on your face? Yea, in any other circumstance that would be the reaction to such an episode; but instead you are watching along waiting for a twist to arrive due to, in this case, the presence of dragons. It actually doesn't do that but instead opts to pull on some heart strings and pull a good joke or two.\\n\\n\r\nThis is honestly what kept me along the whole time. Simply the fact that I know there is going to be an abnormal outcome before the resolution. That and the show enjoys to be quirky with a few side characters, but I will get to them in time. Honestly, I had a nice time working my way through this show since, and brace yourself this may come as a shock, the story is meant to be light-hearted and fun. I wouldn't say that this show turned my opinion around about the genre but I will say it's a gem.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 7 and 7\\n\r\nThis section is honestly going to be shorter then usual since I had no problems with either of the these categories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was simple enough to fit the tone of the show and the animations were smooth enough to actually prove we are advancing in this department. The particle effects were nice and eye popping as they should for a show like this. It all was just well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is in the same boat as the art. The music was light-hearted through the episode, with the opening being a nice jump start to get you going for each episode. The voice acting wasn't over the top or hammy and cheap. The voices simply fit the character involved. Nuff said really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nA nice assortment of people who will get on your good side, one way or another. I will admit, I never found myself disliking any of the main cast. This seems a bit weird for me since I can usually pin point at least one character to place all sorts of unnecessary hate towards. Even if it's just because they act in a way I don't like, but here I couldn't find one person to point that finger at. Also let's just talk about the elephant in the room by saying that I entirely enjoyed Quetzalcoatl's character. What can I say? I like female characters who like playing along the modesty line. But funny enough, she is more then a walking rack of melons. She actually shows a bit of big sister attitude towards people. Like the one who went to college. Also I think I found my spirit animal out of Fafnir, so there is also that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLike I said, I was a bit shaky on this one because of my dislike of the genre as a whole. I honestly was ready to think this show sucked or was to boring and leave it at that. But that didn't happen and I am glad I stuck with it. Like I said before, it won't completely change my perspective on this genre but it will have me more willing to play ball with a few more titles. So long as they don't actually have me follow somebody's normal life. I had dropped Watamote for that very reason.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "\"Roses are red, surely this is folly, please don't lewd the dragon loli.\"\r\n- me trying to be poetic\r\nWith random antics, and virtually no plot, here comes Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid! What's that you say? No plot? How could I rate the story a 9? Well, read on below for more.\r\nStory: As I said in my sarcastic opening, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid doesn't actually have a story. But that works to its advantage, since that gives the writers an excuse to do whatever the hell they want. And what did they do? Just that. So, episodes vary from fun times with Tohru to Kanna having someyuri action. It all works out, and every episode is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is a bit different than what I'm used to. We're all used to animation that most animes have today, but the art works with this anime. I enjoy the small details that are put into this anime, with magic circles, great shading, and random chibi portions. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I love this anime's music, enough to have its opening in my \"weeb\" playlist. But as most animes go, the voice acting is key. And speaking of that, the voice acting is amazing in this anime. I love Fafnir's voice actor, since he always sounds disappointed and emotionless, and Tohru is upbeat and always energetic (but she kinda reminds me of Nyaruko).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Being a SoL anime, there isn't much character development that take place throughout the anime. However, Kobayashi and Tohru do have some development. But overall, the personalities of these characters are already developed, making them not need a change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: You know, at this point, you don't really need me to tell you to watch this anime if you've gotten this far. It's really enjoyable, and has enough for everyone.",

Each episode contained two stories revolving around a few of the main characters as they attempt to live normal human lives and form relationships with each other. The weakest episode was probably the final one. Clearly the writers were looking for some big conflict to end the series with and it just didn't fit with the series and the resolution wasn't particularly satisfying.\r\nThe art was just wonderful, I love the unique character designs (thoughnot a fan of their dragon forms I must admit) and the soft art style which really fits the tone of the series.\\n\r\nThere are a few changes to the dialogue in the dub that I dislike but otherwise the dub is quite well done. All the characters have voices that suit there personalities and there are no moments that really got lost in translation, none that I noticed anyway. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for something light and sweet this anime is perfect.",

However, to me, this anime is the best of it's kind.\r\nThere are so many fluffy feel-good animes out there, but this one sticks out in many aspects. The light and sweet humour around the main characters is very innocent while still touching at the, for the lack of a better word, \"perverse\" comedy so often seen in anime. It has a fair amount of this in it as well of course, but it isn't as central as in other animes.\r\nItalso has a few nice surprises that add some spice to the story to keep it from being a total sugar bomb of goody feelings, yet they don't feel out of place and are finely woven into the story.\\n\\n\r\nWanna feel good?

Tooru is basically in love with Kobayashi cause that is really easy too see also that also that tooru is cheerful and is pretty much the sweetest one. Kanna is the loli dragon and well honestly the cutest thing (honestly i couldnt write that without laughing) but she is cute nice and overall the nicest thing.

            "content": "[Visualize Fry meme here]\r\nNot sure if shoujo ai, or just bestiality...\r\nTo spoiler-free explain the storyline, an average software programmer woman helps out a dragon (yes, you read that right) who is near death. The woman offers to let the dragon (Tooru) stay with her and says she needs a maid, so that's exactly what our dragon who can magically turn into an attractive young woman (with horns and a tail) does. As time goes on, more and more dragons find their way into Miss Kobayashi's world and do like Tohru. There we have the base of the story. \r\nThe story got an 8 because, whilethe SoL episodes are funny and very enjoyable, the serious bents they get onto in a few episodes are often dull and uninteresting. Some of it is backstory, but many times it's backstory that only has to do with Tooru and some strange interaction she had years ago...many times to no avail as it concerns the actual story arc of the show, or minimally so. This is a minor gripe, but what really sunk it was the random, yet somehow boring, finale episode. Again, no spoilers here but it wasn't even a bad ending, just seemed random and not entertaining. It attempted to ask a deep question, but had elements that were unnecessary to explore that tangent. Like I said, everything ended fine, but being such a weak finale really made me disenchanted. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is great in this, with a good mix of classical anime styles along with some of the chibi artwork we see in the ED that's very cute. The more realistic dragon animations and some of the combat was pretty neat too, almost up there with Chunibyou, but not quite as stunning on the visuals (hence the 9 instead of a 10). However there is something that is more assuredly worth mentioning, it gets its own sub-section! (see below)\\n\\n\r\n*\"D\" is for \"Dragon\"*\\n\r\nThe ecchi is sooooooo strong with this one. One of the first things you'll notice about the female dragons is all of them have ridiculous boobs (especially Lucoa) and it's not like they don't want you to notice. The anime is littered with closeups and even has boob \"sound effects\" as well. I felt it was pretty forced, even on a comedic scale, so to me it sort of cheapened it as possible joke material. It was just sort of worn out towards the end and just made you roll your eyes. If you're uptight about it, you may dislike this a lot, but most of it is done for comedic value and not JUST for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was great. The voice acting was excellent and the music was great too, really don't have much to say other than that I loved it! Seemed like the voices matched the characters quite well and the OP end ED were both very catchy and enjoyable. Ironic how it's hard to comment when an anime does something really well!!\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi is a decent main character and I think she is supposed to be sort of dull by design, to show that having Tooru around makes her life better and more enjoyable. The supporting characters are definitely where all the flair comes in, though I would classify Tooru as a main character rather than a supporting. For me, Tooru was pretty much my favorite character and was quite well-written. Just watching her do things in everyday life was entertaining as it was (talking about how she was going to obliterate the dust as she's cleaning the house lol). \\n\\n\r\nEVERYONE loves Kanna, but Lucoa and Elma were great characters as well. Poor Shouta seems destined to die the death every man would pray for...suffocation by Lucoa's boobs. Sometimes it got a little over-the-top with Lucoa, but many times the comedic potential was used well (the Christmas play!!). Elma was actually very funny and interesting, but she received very little development outside of just being the foodie. It was a cute schtick at first, but that's ALL they did with her. Fafnir got some exploration as a character, and it was good to see him changing and progressing through the series. Kanna was definitely adorable and deserves the notice that she gets. She was a great addition to Kobayashi and Tohru, but that brings me to my next point...\\n\\n\r\nSo was it enjoyable? Yes it was, but this suffered from the same problem we ran into with Ichigo Mashimaro...super uncomfortable loli sexualizing. Riko Saikawa is one of Kanna's classmates, and eventually becomes her friend. She is waaaaay attracted to Kanna and even times like when their chests touch, Saikawa practically loses it. This also happens when Kanna eats something off her finger and we get the typical super redface and omg reaction. While they didn't seem to do anything past that (no ecchi stuff or comments on their bodies), it went from being a \"liking her\" to something of an uncomfortable level when suggested body contact was made. That doesn't bother some people (I'm sure of that), but to those like me just a heads up. Barring all of that and the ecchi madness, this anime was funny, cute, and very entertaining. Just like with all the good ones, you go \"NOOO! It's over already???\" at the end of the episode. I could see this one have a lot of replay value, though you MAY want to be careful who you watch it with. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you like SoL comedies and don't mind a ton of boob fanservice and some ecchi as well, you will probably like this show. Get past the creepy loli sexualization and you have a fantastic show. Just watch out for the tail meat...",

            "content": "Kobayashi-san no Maid Dragon is a work of Kyoto Animation, the same company that has created big hits in the anime industry such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Lucky Star and K-On!. But in the recent years, it works are going on a slump, with the reputation of its works losing due to the lack of plot and characters. Will this 2016 Winter anime bring it back to life?\r\nFirstly, plot. The story focuses on Kobayashi, a programmer, and Tohru(or Tooru), a dragon which she saved while she was drunk and is now working as a maid to repay her. As the story goes on,more and more dragons from the other world comes to the human world. The jokes made seems to be forced and the connection between episode and episode is too sudden without any hints for the next episode. Besides, the story is bland even compared with other slice of life anime. But story, in SOL animes, is not really a major factor that would affect the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, art. I will not talk too much about it. KyoAni has shown great art in their works. The backdrops of each scene and the direction in this anime has also shown overflowing quality. The facial expressions are smooth and the character movements are not choppy. They pick up even the slightest detail and avoid raw art unless when necessary for comedic effects.  \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, sound. I will also not focus on this part too much. The opening combined with the art brings out the theme of the anime, the ending fits with every episode to make a conclusion, and the OST was executed perfectly to bring out the mood of those scenes without making a ruckus and diverting our attention from the animation itself.\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, character. You can see the development in characters and how they develop feelings for each other. For example, Kobayashi and Kanna, one of the dragons that came to the human world, have been reliant on Tohru and cannot handle their daily affairs on their own. Kobayashi has also stood up to Tohru's father, a being that could destroy her with ease. Fafnir (again, one of the dragons) has softened his hateful attitudes to humans, at least to his gaming partner Takiya. From these examples, it is needless to say that they are mostly somewhat three dimensional characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the character design of the stars of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi's pink, distinctive hair colour does not really give off the common, office lady feel, but her eyes show listlessness and her outfit is also common. Her personality is straight out flat, with little backstory shown. Despite that, she managed to build connection with other characters. These emphasize her ordinary office lady feel. All in all, a well designed character.\\n\\n\r\nTohru. Her orange hair, eyes, and her green tail hints more strongly than every other character about her dragon lineage, being a Western dragon. Her horns once again brings out the fact that she is a supernatural being again. Her maid costume fits nicely with the title, though it mismatches her overly eccentric and energetic personality. This, though, is what brings out her moeness per se, with some people loving those kinds of contrast.\\n\\n\r\nKanna. Her character design screams one thing. PURENESS. From the white hair, loli body shape, and her white-themed outfit, all that leads to people linking her up with an innocent figure (and what makes people including the creators wanting to lewd her). The existence of he tail that serves as a plug-in is not to bring up her real identity of being a dragon/god of thunder, but instead to emphasize her moeness along with the action of eating anything she comes across, the action that relates to babies.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, enjoyment. I personally adore SOL anime, and while different parts of this anime do not go hand in hand, I was still unable to bring myself to relate and enjoy myself with the show. The characters, while having their own personalities and colours, are to heavily focused on that they just became too bright. The show kind of ruined itself with its characters contrasting too much with each other and unable to bring up their own unique features. We can definitely see the development of characters as said before, but they do not evolve much on their own, with none of their characters changing too much, though that is what I suppose is one of what makes SOL anime attractive. With all that said, it does not need too much jokes that will stuff the show as it is enough with the cute daily interactions with each other, beautiful drawings, and great execution. In my opinion, this anime brings everyone in it together without changing their own colours, and that's what makes this anime beautiful.",

            "content": "Miss Kobayashi dragon maid final review\r\nA beautiful slice of life story about family and friends.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story that this anime portrays is about the japanese society told from the perspective of our characters who try to find their place in the human society. Its about dragons who are searching for their identity as a individual or to be more precise they try to coexist with humans and their everyday life.\r\nThe show manages to put a strong accent on the most common and lovely bond that humans have called family. Our characters who are dragons each with unique traits, experience the daily hardships of humans andhappiness too. It's one of the anime strong points, the struggle for each character to find its place and identity in the human society.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace is slow in the beginning we are introduced to the characters and we learn slowly about their daily habbits(where they work, how they interact with each other, what they like , hate etc). All across the show the pace is steady and slow but this doesn't affect the development of the story because it fits perfect for its genre ,slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also portrays human nature and transition. What's well executed is the transition which is not rushed at all, for example Tohru and Kobayashi when they move to a new place the anime takes time to let the viewer get used to the new enviroment. Tohru meets her neighbours , talks with each other, finds out about the problems in that new place.This is so relayable to a real life situation and was done in a steady and natural pace.\\n\\n\r\nHuman nature is well shown by the dragons personalities and habbits we have gluttony symbolized by Elma, envy and pride for Tohru, love and maturity for Kanna. Also the characters interactions influence the decisions and choices across the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother subjects this anime talks about is about the bond between two persons. Sometimes can be two lovers, friends and the most important one family. The message is very strong in this show about family and Tohru Kanna and Kobayashi are a fine example to describe the word family. They care for each other and influence each other development and decisions across the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the japanese society the anime manages to portray that and shows to the viewer at a steady pace each episode using elements of comedy and drama. We are shown how they work, where the children go to school, and finally how they interact in the society. \\n\r\nWe are shown how hard is to raise a child, what sacrifices you need to make to be with your child and the way a family changes your perspective and actions in the society as a individual. Wonderfull.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 \\n\r\nOur characters are a fine example on how the human society works and they symbolize aspects from the culture of japanese society.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir is our usual otaku who likes to play games and waste time all day. This also criticize how japanese society treats otaku and brings a strong message to the viewer that is not the right way to spend your life.\\n\\n\r\nTohru is the overprotective mother or friend that you can rely on it. Also her character symbolizes identity for a individual as she struggles to accept her own person as a human and not be devoured by her dragon inner strife.\\n\\n\r\nKanna is our usual human child who is curios and needs love and help from a mother. She also acts like a mature person and cares for her friends and family. A relayable character a joy and a irreplaceable treasure for every family called children.\\n\\n\r\nElma is our usual hardworking type character who likes to be independent and has a sharp memory. Luccoa is like a big sister who takes care of her little brother.\\n\\n\r\nFinally Kobayashi and her otaku friend co-worker who likes to go to drinking after work. Her character development is good and influenced by other characters interactions. Also she has a maid fetish when she is drunk.\\n\r\nAll characters are relayable to real life and well written for a slice of life genre and have unique traits and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nBeautiful and vivid colors for evidentiating the feels and inner struggles of our characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound gave me goosebumps every time and a train of feels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI laughed i cried and i was amazed by the rich content and full of feels episodes from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nA beautiful slice of life story portrayed by our dragon characters in the japanese society that brings a strong message to the viewer about family ,friends and how important they are. A lesson of life taught by this anime for the viewers and how to be a better person by helping in your own way the persons that are dear to you, be it family,friends,elders ,or lover.",

            "content": "I can easily describe this show by saying that it's a hybrid of Devil is a Part Timer and Non Non Biyori, while being worse than both. \r\nThe majority of the scenes are what one can describe as \"comfy\": neither interesting or exciting, but not annoying either.  Non Non Biyori is exactly the same, but provides more visual appeal through gorgeously detailed and colored backgrounds.  In Maid Dragon, the settings are generally much more bland.  Both shows share their rare moments that are genuinely funny or endearing.  But for the most part, it's boring; in an oddly tolerable and comfortable way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pretty similar, with one exception, Kanna, who is a without-a-doubt-copyright-infringing-carbon-copy of Renge.  Generally lovable, kind of tropy, shallow and uninteresting, the cast of Maid Dragon does its job in delivering the gags or looking cute.  \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned Maou earlier because this show is also peppered with moments of pseudo parodic chuuni battles and other dragon-related action scenes.  There's also the fact that most of the cast are almighty dragons from another world rather than mere earthlings, but who choose to live among people.  Ring a bell?  The execution of these elements is nowhere near as good as Maou's, though.  The animation is pretty mediocre and the parodies are not exaggerated enough to have a real comical impact.\\n\\n\r\nYeah.. There's not much to say about this show because not much happens within it.  And it's mostly things you've seen before.  But it's not unpleasant, so have a watch if you've got some time to kill.",

She's the most cute character i've seen upto now. and i'm sure everyone acknowledges her cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nTohru, who is the Dragon maid of Kobayashi, is as noted a 'D cup' Being that D stands from Dragon. Good information, She's cute, funny, and in-love with kobayashi.\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi who is the main 'Human' character, a flatchested office lady who is often noted for 'Dead fish eyes' but also has a warm side.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir, the ultimate gamer and Emo Who is the most hilarious in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLucoa, Pretty much just there for her..i suppose triple D cup and her interactions with Shouta.\\n\\n\r\nShouta, there isn't much to say about him, he's just a Shota.\\n\\n\r\nsaikawa, Kanna's friend who Orgasms everytime kanna touches her, not that i dislike ahegao.\\n\\n\r\nkobayashi's office friend Who is also an otaku at home.\\n\\n\r\nElma, who is a Double D cup i think, is a character that was introduced later in the series. she's as cute and funny as other characters but is also unique in how she 'doesn't want to break the balance'\\n\\n\r\nThe anime still needs some backstory for the characters But for now these characters just make the anime very fun and genuine. ( Kanna and saikawa's friendship(?) is the most cute and Innocent one i've seen. )\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:10/10,this anime,even if nothing in it is perfect,Is so far the most entertaining thing i've seen,it's Very heartwarming and it's hard to explain but the anime just gives off this very happy,Unique feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9/10, The series required more background on the dragon world.\\n",

            "content": "the best way i can describe the story is that it's a slice-of-life show with the added gimmick in order to bring new perspective to otherwise mundane parts of life. this could be things like cooking, cleaning, shopping, school, work etc, but now done from the eyes of a mythical flying reptile from another world.  throughout the show more characters are introduced, some human, but mostly consisting of dragons who are friends/enemies of Tooru. they pretty much end up as a weird mesh of a family, with some not having a way to get back home, others because they have found something of interestin that world such as a person or hobby. there's also this backdrop story about a war that is or has taken place in the fantasy world, but it's rarely mentioned or shown. the show does lean on the comedic side with its sexual innuendos, jokes, characters, situation, and so on, but in the most part is hit or miss. the show also has nice sentimental moments which i believe are the best parts of the show, but there's not a lot for what i hoped for. the ending of the show was rather odd, and probably the worst part of the show, although it makes a point about the show when it comes to its characters, it just felt rushed. the story pretty much is what it is, and doesn't really excel for much than what it can reach for\\n\\n\r\n it's better to say that the story is more character driven than it is story driven, as it is with mostly ever slice-of-life show. our main characters are Kobayashi, tooru, and Kanna and kinda serve as a family in the show. Kobayashi is a computer programmer with a rather stoic personality who has difficulty interacting with other people, and also has a thing for maids. Tooru our dragon maid is a lady with a  lot of energy and a go to attitude, A contrast to who Kobayashi is. finally there's kanna, a small dragon child who also has a stoic personality, but also has eyes of wonder and fascination for the human world. the rest of the cast goes as follows Quetzalcoatl AKA Lucoa, an aztec dragon goddess who kinda serves as a mother figure and source of wisdom for others,shota, a young mage who inadvertently summoned Lucoa,Fafnir, a dragon who is a friend of Tooru's and has a hatred for humans, Elma a water dragon who likes human food, makoto,  a friend of Kobayashi, and Riko a friend of Kannas who mostly serves as a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nmost of the cast develops rather small and subtly throughout the story. Kobayashi goes from a stoic person who interacts very little with others and finds it irritating living with dragons; to someone who now enjoys to company of everyone around her. Tooru goes from a somewhat a joke of a maid who just did things for her own pleasure; to an adept maid who now has self-restraint(a bit). this kind of development is also present in the other cast members, and what makes the show a bit more fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nkyoani is always good when it comes to their art and animation these days. the character designs look nice, the colors are bright and vibrant, the background characters and setting look nice. the animation is very good even though it's a slice-of-life show there is still a lot of action-y scenes in this show. however despite being good looking there still really isn't much that makes this show stand out from other good looking shows other than the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the show is good. everyone sounds there part even the dragons when their voices get modified a bit when they turn into actual dragons. the OST for the show is good as well which brings a nice light atmosphere to the show especially the one that plays when Tooru was making omurice with ingredients from another world. however there are only a few that really stood out, and the rest just became background noise.\\n\\n\r\ni'm not the biggest fan when it comes to the slice-of-life genre. when i saw the first episode i was very put off by it, and just binged it after it was almost finished airing. i enjoyed the show more as time went by, but not enough to actually \"like\" it as others do. overall there's a lot of good things about this show, well other than the story but that is what it is. however this show was pretty much made for a specific audience in mind, and i don't believe that i'm a part of it. nonetheless i do believe that this show is a decent addition to the SOL genre.",

            "content": "KyoAni with a feel good slice of life comedy about lesbian dragons?. Pfffft SOLD!\r\nWhat was somewhat a surprise even for KyoAni for LA, comes Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid from Winter of 2017 and this is undoubtably one of the better comedies of this season, even if the premise has an \"uncanny valley\" at first.\r\nWell what better way to start a character-focused comedy anime than it's characters?. Let's start with Tooru, Kobayashi's dragon maid herself voiced by Yuuki Kuwahara, she is overly obsessed dragon that came to live with Kobayashi and she herself has many quirks about herself, like her insistent on feeding Kobayashi her tail(yes seriously) to her massive power level to making some of the most mundane tasks crazy as all hell what with her competitive streak, she is one of the driving forces let alone the catalyst of starting the plot AND allowing more dragons into Kobayashi's and by extensions Kobayashi's friends lives in the process and because of that she's ONE of LA's favourite characters. Next is Kanna Kamui voiced by Maria Naganawa, the next dragon to make her appearance in the series and she has an attachment to Tooru thus came to get her back, however her being a young dragon as it were, she became fascinated with the human world and started living with Tooru and Kobayashi as a surrogate daughter to them of sorts. Kanna is probably the most unpredictable of the characters mainly because of her role in both Kobayashi's house AND at school where she is constantly praised and fawned over the school and especially Riko Saikawa, once prideful and arrogant schoolmate of Kanna's turned yuri fangirl and moe squee machine (and by extension audience surrogate to those who like Kanna as a character in some sense) whenever Kanna does anything remotely moe which is A LOT even coincidentally. Outside of school, she also kinda drives the plot forward when it comes to Tooru and Kobayashi doing things as well. Next is Fafnir voiced by Daisuke Ono, a cynical dragon wanting to destroy all of humanity...instead became Kobayashi's friend Makoto Takiya voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura gaming buddy, if anything he's the cynical deadpan tsukommi to the the rest of the dragons and comedic skits but damn can his flipped expectations of a dragon wanting to burn all of humanity to the ground be reduced to an otaku gaming dragon, nonetheless welcomed addition. The next dragon however is not so, that being Quetzalcoatl voiced by Minami Takahashi a \"god\" accidentally summoned by Shouta voiced by Kaori Ishihara and is this resident shameless fanservice girl and her constant big boobs jiggling is a CONSTANT running gag of hers.....you can see why LA doesn't like Quetzalcoatl as much, but nonetheless she a bit more than shameless fanservice as she's one of the odd voice of reason especially concerning Tooru and Kobayashi as a \"couple\" in a sense. Finally we have Elma voiced by Yuuki Takada, a nemesis of Tooru wanting balance and peace in the human world instead like Fafnir, she begun working in Kobayashi's firm!, her running gag is trying to the self-sustainable and always wanting food as a bribe. She if anything has some of the best comedic skits as much as she comes MUCH later in the anime. Finally, Kobayashi herself voiced by Mutsumi Tamura, a stoic working programmer...at first but as she, Tooru and Kanna start living together she changes for the better as well as being the control factor to the dragons when they try going too far in their antics (especially Tooru) and really Tooru and Kobayashi's relationship is a defining factor to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say the obvious, but this cast has AMAZING chemistry together and they work off together for very funny character jabbing and quick punchlines and with this character chemistry also comes the \"feel good\" in the comedy as essentially, it's a slice of life look at shapeshifting dragons that can turn human living with a human and the implications it has, be it good for the dragons or Kobayashi or the bad especially concerning Kobayashi and Tooru's relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThis slice of life comedy looks into the family issues of such as morality (considering Tooru is an \"immortal dragon\" with Kobayashi's human lifespan) to helping each other grow as a person (Kobayashi with opening herself more with interacting with Tooru and the rest of the dragons to Tooru opening herself to human kind). This comedy is also unpredictable what with DRAGONS let alone shapeshifting ones into the mix as the comedy ranges from household mundane with a punchline to dragons fighting an epic battle as \"fun\" to school antics with Kanna and Riko to Fafnir and Makoto talking about gaming and doujin's etc. This anime kinda got most of it covered and the punchlines are GREAT in the sense because of the unpredictably let alone the dragon's running gags DON'T get old as they are used both sparingly and evolves with it's characters sans Lucoa and Fafnir but nonetheless the comedy is genuinely funny at times!\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by KyoAni, the animation has varying degrees of detail, from moe overload with the very exotic designs of the dragons characters (both as a dragon, human form and concerning Kanna and Tooru, their semi-dragon human forms). There are out and about battles (for fun most of the time) and even the detail there has top notch animation to impeccable detail sometimes akin to a shounen!. The one odd thing LA will note is the uncanny resemblance Kobayashi's character design, it reminds LA HEAVILY of Ryuuichi Baba's character designs from Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken. Nonetheless, even for a slice of life comedy anime, KyoAni pulled out all the stops even with this with LA giving high praise to the character designs and the shounen-esque battles.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, LA will say that Yuuki Kuwahara did exceptional as Tooru, bringing in the right amount of genki and \"non-annoyance moe\" vocals for LA to say that she's LA's favourite voice actor for this anime. Mutsumi Tamura was pretty decent in voicing Kobayashi and the subtle nod to her voice role just the reverse is happening *cough* Sayaka Dejima *cough*. Maria Naganawa was great with her loli moe vocals and also alongside her was Emiri Katou with her fangirling vocals as well. LA could go on but you get the point. The voice cast is VERY good even some of the them being recent rookies seiyuu's.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending by all means, LA will say that the \"resulting drama\" didn't come out of left field at all, LA says this mainly because it has been brought up a couple of times mainly in the form of Tooru's self-conflict about being with Kobayashi let alone her doubts about it and it comes full circle in the finale. The ending as much of a mood whiplash it kinda is, it's kinda justified as LA mentioned with it being hinted at and the bombastically dramatic finale brought something of a resolution to Tooru and Kobayashi's issue with their relationship, thus quite easily some might call this ending a mood whiplash...it's not...it's closure for Tooru and Kobayashi and to that, LA will say it's a fitting end to it all and LA pretty much endorsed it, though the only complaint about this ending is how it's the tired old \"family issues\" drama BUT this \"family issue\" drama does have a point to Tooru and Kobayashi so LA can't fault the anime if it lead it down this direction for the finale. EITHER way good way to send things off.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say what LA said at the beginning of this review, \"What was somewhat a surprise even for KyoAni for LA\" and it seriously was one of the more surprising titles to come out of Winter 2017, sure it's a slice of life comedy but those are it's genre roots and it uses them WELL, characters are all unique and interesting and their running gags don't fall flat after one episode, the anime also has a shade of a feel good comedy especially when it dives into matters of Tooru and Kobayashi's relationship which gets a resolution come the finale. Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon was LA's 2nd favourite comedy for Winter 2017 and well deserved as it checked most of the boxes and beyond that for a feel good comedy with interesting characters and brilliant animation from KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni, you did it again!",

            "content": "When you watch this anime, you may just expect it to be a cute anime with dragons... well that is true but I see a deeper meaning behind it. You may disagree or you may agree.. idrc. So, in the beginning you see Kobayashi alone until Tohru appears before her. Everything changed for Kobayashi when Tohru showed up. Through my eyes, I saw that everything was going slow for Kobayashi.. like she didn't feel free and happy. I also saw this on the last episode, you look around in her apartment and it's just a giant mess. It's almost like she's lost the courage todo anything... and when she didn't want to go out for a beer with Takiya. But when Tohru was there she could do anything by her side. When Kobayashi got the second chance to see Tohru again.. she wanted to do anything to get back Tohru again. Anyways, like the saying, \"Time flies when you're having fun,\" I think this applies to this story. The reason I think this is because the story is telling us that things and people don't last forever and that we need to spend as much time we need with the ones we love. And you shouldn't have regrets even if that takes the risk of being sad in the end.. as long as you had a good time while it lasted and that you made the most memories out of what we still have. You should treasure the time you have left. That's all I really have to say about this anime. I think it's amazing and I don't regret watching it. I hope you think the same.",

The episodes in the anime shows the daily life of Tooru and Kobayashi-san living together. It is very funny and gets interesting from there. You also get to see more of Tooru's friends from her previous world and there's more hilarious and troubling moments for Kobayashi to handle.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nKobayashi-San: She goes by that name only (that's all the anime mentions). She is an office worker and is monotone (kind of). But she is also very kind and caring, and gets turned up on occasions.\r\nTooru: Yes, she is theDRAGON MAID herself! In her world, she is a dragon, but in order for her to be with Kobayashi-San, she has to transform herself into a human. She is kind and caring too, but sometimes she can get out of hand and tends to be jealous (she loves Kobayashi).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI will always love slice of life. It's awesome to see the connection Kobayashi-san has with Tooru. It's funny how the two worlds can intertwine with each other by having dragons and humanity together.",

            "content": "This anime has received generally quite positive feedback, but the issues that it contains are not ignored all in the same. While I do not believe this is a bad anime by any means, it is not too good of an anime either; overall, I have a fairly mixed opinion on this series. \r\n(WARNING: May contain spoilers) \r\nArt- \r\nThe art in this anime is quite bright and cute; but that being said, it isn't anything special. Really, this is to be expected of any slice of life series, so not much problem there. It is kinda fun watching the colourful cast of characters animate, butnot more than that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Art Rating: 6 \\n\\n\r\nStory/Plotline- \\n\r\nThe story follows a rather simple, everyday girl whom suddenly takes in a dragon maid; from there, the anime shows growth in the bond between Kobayashi and Tohru, following their everyday adventures. I admit the plot is kinda cute, but it's nothing special; then again, that is to be expected of your typical slice of life anime. It's enough to keep me entertained, but not much more than that. I don't really have too much to say on this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Story Rating: 4 \\n\\n\r\nSound- \\n\r\nAgain, sound is nothing special, but it's decent. Nothing particularly memorable or anything, and the opening isn't too good either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Sound Rating: 4 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- \\n\r\nThis is probably the main point of my review; for there are a lot of issues with the characters in this series. While some come across as cute and awfully likeable like Tohru, Elma and Fafnir, others like Lucoa were a huge problem. There was also Kanna, whom despite fitting into the same category as Tohru, got ridden with child pornography. That doesn't go to say that I don't like her character, but it was just too much; sure, her relationship with Saikawa was cute at first, but it kinda got out've hand. Kids, while they may show interest in each other in the form of crushes, should in no way be acting like that; and even if they did, it's definitely uncomfortable to watch on screen. I admit at times it was funny, but the majority differed. That is really a minor problem however when compared to the worst issue with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that'd be Lucoa, as I'm sure most of you whom have watched this anime can guess. While she initially just starts as a slutty, fan-service character, that changes drastically over the duration of her screen time. What I thought was hints at potential depth was merely the very outer surface of her horrible character, in which is an utter and absolute pedophile. Sure, maybe if they joked about this a bit it would be fine, but when it gets to the point that she's attempting to sleep and bathe with a much younger boy in a sexual way, it's inexcusable. It's just really uncomfortable to watch with her wearing purposefully slutty outfits and then trying to be a companion towards Shouta in a frankly lewd way; similar to watching Saikawa and Kanna but much worse, it's incredibly uncomfortable watching pedophilia. For there is no other bond between the two apart from the sexual desires Lucoa has for Shouta- gee, the poor kid. \\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side of this anime however, I did really like the emphasis on homosexual relationships; it was really cute watching Fafnir and Takiya get along, as well as Tohru and Kobayashi. I also really like the general personalities of many of the characters, and in particular Fafnir who I can kinda relate to myself; so while it is overall pretty good, there are underlying issues within that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Character Rating: 7 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- \\n\r\nNot much to say on this either; it's a slice of life anime, and it's fun and cute to watch. That being said, it's not overwhelmingly engaging or especially deserving of a positive review; but that doesn't go to say it's bad or anything. Thus I give a solid 5 on this one, for I have mixed feelings on it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment Rating: 5 \\n\\n\r\nOverall- \\n\r\nIf you like cute, fun slice of life anime, this is for you; but only if you can handle the discomfort that this series otherwise brings. I do believe it is overrated, but it's not so bad either. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Dragon Maid is a yuri slice of life anime with some...interesting...undertones. I'm going to review this by Story, Art, Sound, Characters, and Enjoyment, like the official review scorer. \r\n[SWEARING AND SOME SPOILERS AHEAD]\r\nStory: 5/10 It's a great concept if a bit cliche, a magical being comes to the human and doesn't understand shit, the human is stoic and peeved, the magic being is all smiles, and there's a host of weirdos that come along for the ride. It's very good at first, with excellent comedy and touching moments with the title characters, Kobayashi and Tohru the Dragon Maid. Kanna is just generally adorable, and itfeels very sweet and nice. Then the middle of the series rolls around and everything goes to absolute shit. This includes meaningless characters, idiotic repetitive jokes, and pedophilic undertones. Actually undertones is a bad way of describing it, as a fucking second grader has an ahegao orgasm every three seconds, a dragon with watermelons for breasts smothers a child with them repeatedly, and at one point Kanna nearly goes full on R. Kelly on ahegao girl. Thankfully it improves by episode 9, which was my favorite episode and single-handedly raised this anime's score from a 2 to a 4. the rest of the show is decent, though the last episode is a bit cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 Nice art, simple in design and very colorful. I loved the fight scene animation and I wish there had been more. It was fluid, smooth, and very warm and cheery. The character design was good except for a certain ex-goddess of fertility.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 I loved the Dragon Maid OP, I even added it to my master playlist. It's very happy and fun to listen to, and I never skip it as it is quite frankly the best part of the entire show. The ending is good too, though I frequently skipped it. The actual anime audio is good, the sound effects are on point, although the amount of noises Lucoa's breasts make when they jiggle is a bit excessive. As for the English voice acting (I watched the dub) it's good overall, if pretty typical. Kobayashi is very entertaining to listen to when drunk, but Takiya's otaku voice is grating and annoyed me. The other characters have pretty typical voices and I can't fault them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10 Oh boy, this category is a doozy. Every character in this anime has quality varying from good to downright awful. Let's start with the best. Kobayashi, Tohru, and Fafnir all are entertaining, sweet, and likable. Kobayashi's stoic attitude is a nice contrast to Tohru's cheery ignorance and Fafnir's comical emo hatred is funny and a nice way to balance out the cast. On to the \"ok\" characters. Elma is not altogether bad, but very underdeveloped, as her late introduction gives her a very one-dimensional personality with a somewhat exasperating indecisiveness. Takiya is an alright character, and his dual personality from normal office worker to Fafnir's crazed otaku roomie is comical but grating. Shota is also alright, though I was too busy pitying his poor slot in life to really analyze his character. Now here's the selection of characters that killed this anime for me: Kanna, Riko, and *shudder* Lucoa. All of these characters are awful, and each for similar reasons. You might be saying, \"sPEtZ kaNnA iS ABsOluTeLY pERfeCt kILL yoURseLf\" but let me explain. Kanna is indeed adorable, precious, and God's gift to humanity. Thing is, she also attempted to rape a child. Kanna is 600+ years old, and literally forces Riko onto the ground and says she's gonna go \"Dragon Style\". What. The. Fuck. This was a major turn-off to me as this kind of thing is unacceptable. So that's why I kind of hate Kanna. Riko is up next and her character is pretty simple. She's absolutely infatuated with Kanna in a clearly sexual way despite being a second grader. Whenever Kanna brushes by her she has a goddamn ahegao orgasm. A fucking second grader. Orgasming. Some of you may find this cute but for me that's really fucking creepy. Now, onto the bitch that literally brought this anime's quality down from a 6 to a 2. (episode 9 and the OP brought it up to a 4.) Lucoa is an awful character, not because she's designed for fan service but rather for the fact of how she does it. Her breasts aren't large, they're disproportionately massive, to the point of looking like tumorous watermelons growing off her chest. What does she do with these absolute units of tits you ask? She rubs the face of a nine year old boy with them. Dis-fucking-scusting. She also refuses to look modest, to the point of disgust rather than being turned on. She repeatedly antagonizes Shota with them to the point he thinks she's a succubus. She often acts pedophilic towards him but no one cares, because \"hey! It's a chick!\" despite the unnerving similarity to Boku No Pico at some points. Also, after analyzing the character, personality, and mythological factors it's safe to assume that Lucoa may be a male dragon. Did anyone else just see Jared from Subway flicker in front of them like Slenderman, or is it just me? Either way it made this character meaningless and intolerable. All in all, the characters are the worst part of this anime and if a good amount were dropped it could have brought this anime to an 8 or even 9. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10 This anime has a fantastic OP, an interesting story, and some likable characters. The art is clean, the audio is good, and Fafnir is hilarious. However, the inclusion of excessive fan service, maid fetishes, lolicon influence, and pedophilic undertones brought this anime down exponentially, and it's a sorry shame that this couldn't have been better. Fuck you Lucoa. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Dragon Maid is a failure of an anime that could have gone far. Don't buy into the hype, this anime is only worth watching if you like feeling like a pervert after completion. I would love to see a rewrite of this concept with a higher focus on the ignorance comedy and quasi-dimensional battle concept. However it is instead a pulpy creepfest that left me feeling uncomfortable. And that's my whole review of Dragon Maid, thanks for reading if you got this far!",

            "content": "What an incredibly overrated anime this is and also, what an incredible disappointment.  The first episode was great.  The off-the-wall comedy really hit well and I liked the dichotomy between Kobayashi and her isolated and sarcastic nature, when contrasted with Tohru's bombastic personality.  The quirky and quasi-inappropriate nature of the comedy made me think I was gearing up for an anime along the lines of Dai Mahou Togue or My Wife is a Mermaid.  Truly hilarious classics.  Alas, it was not meant to be.\r\nAs soon as the other dragons were introduced, everything started going downhill fast.  The primary problembeing Kanna.  Yes, we get it, Kanna is cute and moe and all of that, but she took over the anime and changed it from a quirky and unique dragon comedy into just another \"Raising a child\" comedy.  Way too much focus on her.  And when the other dragons were introduced, they were completely empty as characters and did nothing to change the nature of the anime and balance it out from another boring moe-fest.  And each dragon got more empty and 1 dimensional as a character as they were introduced.  It basically got so bad that the final dragon's whole gimmick was just being indecisive.  That's it.  Her whole character was based upon not being able to make up her mind.  The others could be described in two words: \"Otaku\" and \"Oppai\".  \\n\\n\r\nKobayashi and Tohru's seemingly promising relationship from the first episode ends up bogged down in the same flaccid jokes about Otakus and chicks with Big Boobs as any other mediocre \"Slice-of-Life\" anime with those tropes in it, plus buried in a pound of moe.  Very disappointing.  Especially since it seemed like it could be so much more.  It could have even been a great action anime, considering the quality of the very few battle scenes within it.  \\n\\n\r\nSuch a disappointment, considering the first episode and those fight scenes meant that with proper direction, this could've been a fantastic twisted action-comedy of some kind.  \\n\\n\r\nHighly overrated and disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

            "content": "WARNING! THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAt first, this anime might seem like a stupid show with a bunch of fanservice so that all the fans can continue to watch it, and in some waysit is. But I was surprised how much heart this anime has. It explored subjects that you wouldn't expect in this show. Like if it 's worth spending time with someone if you know that the person will die long before you do. The friendships feel much more realistic because of that. Fafnir and Takiya weren't too friendly to each other which made their relationship realistic. And even though Kobayashi and Tohru's relation was much more friendly, it made sense with their characters.\\n\r\nThe shorter scenes also helped the story to feel more realistic. Cause not every action you do is going to affect the next. \\n\\n\r\nBut even though most of the characters felt very realistic, they all had character flaws, motivations, multisided and character development, there were two characters that I wasn't fond of. Those characters were Lucoa and Shouta. They both, at least in the middle, seemed to only have one purpose, being fanservice, which is something that I didn't like in this show. The reason for Shouta's existence is to be harassed by Lucoa, at least it felt like that to me. And it's a shame cause in the beginning and end, Lucoa was a pretty okay character. She wasn't just tits on two legs, but she actually had a personality, relative to Shouta who didn't. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the rest was pretty great. The music (especially the OP and ED) was great, the artstyle was fantastic (except for some of the backgrounds) and in general, the show is one of the funniest out there (from what I have seen)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up this show, I would say that it is a funny show with great animation and a lot of heart.\\n\r\nIt's a 9/10 from me",

            "content": "* THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS *\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid in my view is an anime about personality development and change. Even among anime it does an outstanding job about how smoothly, almost unnoticeably, but still deeply it changes its main characters. Although the story offers nothing especially new in the slice of life genre (telling about the life of a working woman and two adorable young girls), it still offers great characterization and meaningful messages under a funny, cute and very entertaining surface.\r\nThe show is about Miss Kobayashi (a software engineer in her mid-twenties) and how her life changes after she takes in two girls,Tohru and Kanna, who are actually dragons from another world. They have the ability to use magic and turn themselves into cute girls, making it easier for themselves to blend into society. Tohru is like any teenage girl: friendly, kind, loudmouth, and overly obsessed with Kobayashi. She does everything her master asks from her, even without the smallest sign of gratitude. Kanna plays the role of the cute little sister, the smallest member of the family who gets everyone's love, admiration and most of Kobayashi's attention, which bears jealousy in Tohru; a feeling what makes the elder girl an even more complex character.\\n\r\nDespite the fact that Tohru and Kanna are mighty, mythical creatures, they act and feel very much like any human. They can be equally happy and sad, and also very hysterical sometimes. They're excited to learn new things and meet new people, and sometimes (as children occasionally do) they conceal their real feelings and emotions from others, especially from Kobayashi, who, in contrast with the sparkling dragon-girls, is more like a little gray mouse.\\n\r\nKobayashi is an ordinary, featureless woman: small breasted, bespectacled, who wears shirts with ties at work and hoodies at home; nothing sexy or cute from her part. Her days are pointless, free from any excitement, all about working and drinking with her only friend, Takiya. She's a loner, who must adapt to living together with and taking care of two girls. Even though Tohru becomes her maid and does every chores for her, Kobayashi still has to make her own sacrifices for her new family. Although she struggles with it initially, as the show progresses she grows slowly and unwittingly from the selfish, careless woman into a responsible mother, one who learns how to take care of others, how to love, and how to be loved. She realizes the small changes in her personality only when someone (usually Takiya) highlights it for her, as she herself is already forgotten about her former self. Just like people change in real life.\\n\r\nTohru changes almost in the same degree as Kobayashi. The dragon who initially despises humanity turns out to be fascinated by them. The main catalyst in her alteration is obviously Kobayashi who didn't just let her stay at her place, but actually saved her life before. Thanks to her, Tohru realizes that humans can be more than a race which hunts and slays dragons, that they can be good, kind and caring, and are able to achieve great things together. By the end of the show, Tohru herself becomes almost as much a human as a dragon, admitting that she belongs now more into the human world than the one she hails from.\\n\r\nThe character designs of Tohru and Kanna are pieces of masterful art themselves. You can't help but love both of them. The energy and girlishness which comes from Tohru's personality and Kanna's extreme cuteness are the results of not just the art department, but also the seiyuu who actually bring the characters to life. They're both charming, adorable, and really, really cute. You just can't get enough of them.\\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't speak so high about the supporting characters. They're well-designed, too, Riko is also a cutie, but most of them (save for Takiya perhaps) are as boring and empty as the main characters are rich and exciting. They have no real purpose in the story at all. You can't help but to have the feeling that those characters are only in the show to replay the same gags over and over again, which are not just boring after the first one or two times, but can be really annoying and infuriating. Repeating the same jokes multiple times, especially within the same episode, is just not funny at all. Fortunately, the main characters compensate us for everything.\\n\r\nThe background design is made in a low-detailed style, which makes the characters more prominent and more focused. The backgrounds and the environment are like sketchy pencil drawings, which looks really good and serves the show perfectly.\\n\r\nThe music was a little bit strange to my ears in the beginning, but I got used to it after a few episodes. The opening and ending themes are perfect, they instantly brings the mood for the show. I couldn't get them out of my mind even days after I've finished the series.\\n\r\nAlthough it's a comedy anime, it's not a laughing out loud type. The funny elements come from the personalities and interactions of the three main characters: how Tohru and Kanna see our world and humanity, and how they get on with Kobayashi and with each other. You won't laugh much, but I guarantee you that you won't be able to wipe the smile off your face while you're watching this show. That's what Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid's true virtue is. It makes you smile and forget all your troubles and problems for that twenty-four minutes its episodes last. It's an easy to watch anime (although it tends to spin up every now and then), which turns off your mind and just entertains you. It has fantasy elements (we're speaking about dragons here), but those are cursory, just like the drama aspect of the show, which is so negligible that it's almost none-existent at all. It's not a perfect anime, it has it's pros and cons, but if you can ignore some fanserivce and a few annoying characters, and you do not expect a twisted story, you'll be highly rewarded.\\n",

It reminded me a lot of both the anime \"The Devil is a Part-Timer\" and the cartoon \"Steven Universe\". Mainly due to how it involves characters from another world coming to Earth as well as integratijg and loving the planet, yet the character dynamics for all 3 of these shows is different, so there's enough nuance to say that this is a pretty good show of it's own fruition. The most lacking part of the show is thepersonalities of the characters, they almost all fall into very basic categories of the typical anime character (the kawaii girl, the big boobs girl, the lovey dovey girl, the rival girl, etc.) with the only truly unique and realistic character in the show being Miss Kobayashi herself. It's an enjoyable watch, but not really an anime to take very seriously or to be moved by I suppose. I can certainly say, I came for the memes and stayed for the memes.",

            "content": "A new meaning for the term D-cup! Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid....is exactly that. Its the slice of life adventure of a woman(Kobayashi) and her newly \"indebted\" maid dragon Tohru. And its your basic mythological creature interacts with our world adventure.\r\nThe trailer of this series is criminally misleading. All the promotional material is for that matter. It makes it look like your typical fetish harem made for socially awkward guys and girls. And at times it can be. But its not just fetishy. Tohru does feel attraction to Kobayashi from the start but its handled very slowly. Their relationship is very much allowed to blossom andisn't just a after three episodes their in love kind of deal. Its even safe to say by the end of the first season its debatable if they're even in a romantic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention this is funny writing. I laughed very hard at several on the jokes  that I missed the next joke. I had to pause the show several times I found it so funny. There's the typical jokes you'd expect, people freaking out about a dragon. But theres also lines that make you think for a second and laugh at the obscurity. This mainly comes from the dragons being ignorant of typical humans stuff, but at the same time isnt what you'd expect. There's no five minute \"this is a microwave!\" Jokes like that, its more of them not understanding things in our world that don't make sense, but since were so use to the way things are. That when the dragons call it out its very funny. The best example of the comedy is theyre explaining the little match girl to Tohru. And they get to the part where the girls grandma takes her to heavan via hug. Tohru just flat out says \"So the grandma murdered her granddaughter.\" And its so shocking its hilarious. And the shows full of this kind of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets take a look at our leading lass Kobayashi. She's fun. This is very much a character were suppose to step into the shoes of. But that doesn't mean she's completely not her own thing. She's snarky, sarcastic, hard working, and surprisingly doesn't take any of the dragons crap. But isn't a Tsundure, she's a woman who had magical beings thrusted into her life and its her job to keep it together and put them in their place. Despite this she still has her great qualities she's very motherly to Canna the youngest dragon, she goes out drinking, she has tons of snarky comments, and is all around a good protagonist. Tohru is the perfect match to her. She's easily excitable, hardworking, friendly(after she gets use to humans), and all around fun to watch. While having her own silly moments. One of the running gags it trying to get people to eat her tail.\\n\\n\r\nThe other dragons all have good moments too Canna(little white one) starts off weak, as a typical tsundure. But after fifteen minutes turns into a pretty adorable fan favourite. She has some of the funnier lines in the show. And her and Kobayashi's relationship is something special. Luccoa(green hair) is nice enough, Elma(blue) isn't in it much but when she is, has a very one note personality and that is hungry so don't expect much, and Fafnir(Dude) is the typical \"I hate humans\" god complex that finds a love for gaming. \\n\\n\r\nAll and all in a show motivated by characters they are all very interesting and I love the designs. For each character they're given a nice recognizable vivid color scheme. Its actually very good at blending with the colorful yet simple background the world has to offer.\\n\r\nThe music....exists. With slice of life shows unless the music is used to add drama it goes right over my head. But the intro and ending themes are both very catchy, dare I say stuck in your head worthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have with the show is how its handles the kids in certain situations. Starting with Luccoa and her human Shouta. The main joke is she has big boobs and hes nervous about them. Thats all well and good but Shouta is a child! Like he's ten years old and they treat her constantly shoving her breasts all over his face as a running gag! And to make it worse Canna is given a subplot with her human friend. It starts with what seems like her little friend thinks she's cute at first. And I had no issue with it but the human kid is kind of obnoxious. Then in what feels like an episode....it seems they want to.....be closer. As in it hints these kids want to be more then friends.  with them also being little kids its really awkward and it kinda made me want to turn it off.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then both only get too weird on about two segments that are easily avoidable. So if you like cute slices of life then I recommend checking it out.",

            "content": "It's very tough for me to enjoy something that's *not* Romance. But I'm a big fan of comedy too and Kobayashi San is an excellent example of comedy and slice of life done right!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nBeing a Slice of Life, it's a given that there'll be zero plot progression. It's just the daily life of the characters. That said, it's a very fun and cute take at a daily life of a depressed Kobayashi, a cheerful Tohru and the cutest thing in the world, Kanna. Their interactions and hilarious takes at how to adjust with the human world is really something cute and fun to watchtoo. Kobayashi San is one of those few anime that *actually made me laugh*. Other comedies would make me smile, but I haven't laughed this much since KonoSuba!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is something new and refreshing to watch, I really enjoyed how it looked, it excellently matched the mood of the anime as well as accentuated the Moe moments (which were many too!!!)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPerfectly chosen VAs and perhaps the first time in a long time that *both* the OP and ED of an anime were great make this anime's sound rating a full on 10. Sometimes an anime gets a good OP, or sometimes none are great but for Kobayashi San *both* were great, and this is incredible in a sense too. Aozora no Rhapsody and Ishukan Communication were both catchy and immersive. Another plus point goes to the OST, perfectly fitting the mood and adding to the Moe power in it's respect moments too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nZero plot progression also means that the characters have to be great from the start, or else deal with the low ratings, but Kobayashi San's characters were great right from the start. Thankfully the MC is a woman or else if it was a teenage boy then things would *seriously* go south (as in it would be an Ecchi Romance misadventure to feed the snotty teens of today). \\n\\n\r\nKobayashi: The MC, Kobayashi lived a very normal life and has a cynical view of life. She changes slowly when Tohru becomes her maid. Though hints are given throughout the anime that her cynical worldview isn't completely gone, it does get toned down. \\n\\n\r\nTohru: Found by Kobayashi under 'mysterious circumstances', Tohru quickly gets hired as a personal maid for Kobayashi and tries to learn the working of the world. Other dragons do join her (one of just favourites being Fafnir San apart from Kanna of course) but they're role is limited even for supporting actors. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I seriously laughed while watching the anime. At most I would smile at other comedies (though KonoSuba is the only other anime series I ever laughed at) but Kobayashi San is a really good comedy. If you're in it for the the comedy like I was then you'll definitely not be disappointed. Mark my words!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life Comedy, you can't judge the anime for having no plot progression as thats not what the anime intends to do. The anime is a worthy watch if you're a Comedy fan or a Slice of Life fan. Personally speaking this is one of my top favourites of 2017!",

It's a cool and funny story which you can see casually, and that's make me feel good.\r\nAbout the story, it's an comedy anime, so obviously the story isn't like WWOOOAAWW, but it still a funny story which include different periods of the year and realted events which we can watch quietly. I think the part of the story at the end (CARE SPOIL LOL) with the father of Thor is a bit useless, despite the fact it add a more intense scene. Anyway it still OK.\r\nFor the art, how to say it.... IJUST LOVE the art of this anime. The contrast between the character design and the environment design is just so cooool. Characters are net and the decors are more in aquarelle painting style, and that's is a bit unusual and it's nice ! Animation is cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound are nice, I loved opening and ending, and OST.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nice, with differents style and nature which make them unique, and with a interesting evolution, it's funny to see a dragon which don't like humans become a gamer who love video games and start to live with an human, and more than that, appreciate him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 10/10++, I laughed during all the anime, it was really fun and this anime transporting us in this another world, in their story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I think this anime is unique, as all anime, and in the comedy category, it's really nice. I can't give the grade of 10/10 because I keep this grade for excellent anime, or anime more psychologic, thriller or seinen which are deeper in the story and the reflexion, but this anime still really good, and if you search a cool anime, that's the good one ! :)",

The love between Tohru and Kobayashi, Fafnir and Takiya, and Kamui and Saikawa is clearly shown without being hypersexualized. (Lucoa and Shouta definitely have some ecchi things going on, but even then it's pretty harmless and cute. Lucoa honestly more like the clingy older sister than a love interest.) These little makeshift families are honestly so cute and I could watch them forever. \r\nI also really like the supernatural elements. Although we don'tget to see that much of Tohru's world, we get a sense of it from her memories and the hilariously censored foods that she brings back. I love all the mythological references that are thrown in too.\\n",

            "content": "I may have made the grave mistake of comparing an anime to it's source material, but at the same time I, by doing so, found out just how /amazing/ Kyo-ani is at adaptions.\r\nAt first glance, the premise and characters of Meidoragon are nothing special--and I'll admit that they stay so. Kobayashi starts as a dead-eyed OL and stays one, Tohru is a dragon who's a maid and continues to be, and the rest... you get my flow. The premise, though interesting, doesn't stick out much either. What's truly captivating about this show are the relationships.\r\nNo, don't get me wrong, I don't mean the KobayashiTohru yuriaction. I meant the bonds between the characters and how you see them growing as the series progresses. It's done nicely and subtly so that you barely realize it happens at all, but when you compare the first episode to the last, you'll see the difference between how the characters interact. One scene in which this really stands out is when Shouta practices banishing demons on Lucoa, and Lucoa runs out. There're a lot of scenes in between of different characters (as this is the storytelling style of Meidoragon), but when we cut back to Shouta we see him panicking and running out to find Lucoa (she's out there petting a kitten, don't worry). This is significantly different from how Shouta treats and sees Lucoa in the start of the anime: a demon succubus that he must get rid of.\\n\\n\r\nBack to what I said about the characters staying the same. The thing about Meidoragon is that the characters don't necessarily grow, they discover. The characters (especially Kobayashi and Tohru) are invited to dig deeper into their inner souls (is this an exaggeration? I hope I'm not exaggerating it too much) and discovering things about themselves that allows them to unlock parts of themselves they never knew existed. I think this is called development, but I seriously wouldn't call it that in this case. Call me stubborn, but the characters don't get over, say, a fatal flaw that allows them to progress further in life. They learn to get the most from the current situation, and even though that's staying where they are, it's nice to see them having a good time from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art are amazing as always, nothing less than what I'd expect from Kyo-ani.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the controversial part. This show fully shows Kyo-ani's abilities to adapt because it was so drastically improved once it was animated by Kyo-ani. Many of the order of events were changed to increase the meaning of them (eg. Shouta was introduced earlier), and new gags were rightfully placed to enhance the viewing experience in general. Kyo-ani also added the humanity into it, in my opinion. The original manga was about 60% fanservice, 30% plot that is also fanservice, and 10% actual character interaction and development. Kyo-ani changes this 30% so it takes up more of the pie that is Meidoragon (taking away some from the 60% of fanservice). As a result, characters got better, character motives were clearer, and the emotional impact from the last few episodes got insanely larger. \\n\\n\r\nCall me biased, but I totally bought the whole sweet domestic fluff thing (and how Kyo-ani adapted source material in general), which is why I'd give this anime a 10.",

            "content": "First off let me say that this anime is not for anyone looking for plot or a great story. Miss Kobayshi's Dragon Maid was a great series during the winter 2017 series. While we had intense shows about magical warfare and demons slaying other demons (you know which anime's i'm referencing.) This was a great show to take a breather from and turn my brain off to enjoy some comedy between dragons and humans. In this anime there is no story line to go along with except for the Miss Kobayashi was drunk one night and stumbled upon a large dragon with a sword inher. Telling her that she owes Kobayashi a favor and tells her to be her maid while she is still drunk. The next day Kobayashi wakes up with a hangover and sees a dragon waiting at her doorstep which soon turns into her human form named tohru and becomes Kobayshi's maid. Soon after Tohru becomes a maid, different dragons from where Tohru is from soon live with humans and establish a relationship. The rest of the story is just Tohru and her friends doing magical and normal things would do. If you thought that this anime sounds boring. Its not. I thought it was gonna be boring before i watched it. But soon turned out to be one of my favorite anime's of the season, or in fact ever. The real plot doesn't kick in until the last episode but i don't want to get in depth with it. The animation for Kobayashi is absolutely gorgeous with bright colors that match the shows tone very well. The opening was one of my favorites where at times i would play it again for how catchy it was. Characters were also very fun and at times relatable. Overall Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid was a great anime for the last season Out of 10 I would give it a 9/",

            "content": "Coming into the Winter 2017 season I honestly wasn't hyped about many of the animes being released. Of course I was hyped for Konosuba S2 and Kuzu no Honkai (Since I loved the manga.) But besides those I didn't have much hope for the Winter 2017 season, I didn't even bother starting anything else and decided to just binge watch older series. However due to the amount of praise some of the series were getting I decided to pick a few of the most talked about. I saw a bunch of GIFs of Kanna and Tohru and decided Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid might be wortha shot. BOY was I not disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEVERYTHING about this anime managed to kept me interested, even though there was no real plot to the anime i'd often find myself wanting to watch episode after episode just because of how cute and fun the anime was. The characters outfits were all really aesthetically appealing. The art style at first glance was good but certainly nothing I haven't seen before, however when I actually started watching the anime I noticed that EVERYTHING was vibrant and bright, EVEN FAFNIR, THE EDGIEST CHARACTER IN THE ANIME MANAGED TO BE VIBRANT WELL STILL MAINTAINING A DARK VIBE. However the selling point for me was LITERALLY every single eating scene. Most times eating scenes in anime are there to just have a simple back round well they further the plot forward HOWEVER, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid creates some of the CUTEST eating scenes ever. Just search up \"Kanna eating scene\" in YouTube and I guarantee you won't regret it. The OP and ED are both extremely fun and exciting to listen to, they get you pumped up and ready to start a brand new episode, however the OP may be my personal favorite OP of Winter 2017. After watching 2 episodes of this anime I went and worked on an art project for 2 hours with the OP on loop. The ED is also good but I really think the best part of the ED is the photo's of all the characters\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few characters that didn't get enough character development such as Elma and Lucoa (Espically Elma) both these characters went kind of unused, well Lucoa could be excused because she was part of a running gag of making poor Shouta scared of her and calling her a \"demon\" (even though she's quite literally a goddess) I feel like they could have made her a more interesting character by making her have a closer connection to Kobayashi and Tohru instead of just making her the go-to-gal for some quick fan service. Elma I think had no excuse for not getting enough development, they introduced her later into the show so I figured she'd just kind of be put off to the side, but she only really showed up again in 1 or 2 episodes and to give a quick giggle in between transition scenes. Even in the episodes she was in she was only there for a few minutes and got like 3-4 lines. The ending really wasn't that creative and it felt like I have seen it many times before, typical one character fights another main character, love interest stands up for them and through their love the overcome to issue.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to anyone, even if you're into cute and fun anime's I definitely think you'll still find some enjoyment in this one",

            "content": "I remember this show being all the craze last season. Everyone was watching it. Everyone was praising it. Needless to say, for a show that didn't initially grab my attention, I was intrigued. By the time the show had ended and went for free on Crunchyroll, I decided to get into it, and I am happy to report that I did not enjoy it whatsoever. It ended up being an incredibly shallow show, with lots of pointless fanservice that culminated to absolutely nothing. A very weak lead with an even weaker deuteragonist, with a hollow relationship with the only benefit that attracted all these peoplein the first place was because it was about a lesbian couple, because diversity without proper character writing sure does work, doesn't it? I sure do have a lot to say about this show and I can't wait to sink my teeth into it to talk about how much I despise this show, because if you haven't realized by now, I'm actually fucking with you and I genuinely enjoyed this show albeit some caveats that I'd like to discuss. First, let's focus on the positives.\\n\\n\r\nMiss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon is primarily a comedy anime, and as far as comedy goes, it does that aspect pretty well. You can definitely see KyoAni's usual influence for its shows on top of the original writer's unique sense of humor. A dash of cute and adorable slice-of-life often broken up by sudden instances of subtle dark humor. Many of the show's elements contribute to how well-delivered a lot of the jokes are. KyoAni abandons it's unique art style and lighting effects exhibited in most of its shows to deliver a more down-to-earth and simple art style to better reflect the comical nature of the show. A visible downgrade from the standards set by the studio? Maybe. However, the comedy in this show wouldn't have worked that well if everyone had highly-detailed eyes or hair in my opinion, so I think this change of style is welcome especially in place of a style frequently used by the same studio. In addition, the studio does go overboard with some details put into specific key animations, often which are used for comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters and how they help enhance the humor, you have Kobayashi's dead-serious done-with-this-shit attitude for many of Tohru's misfits; Tohru's usual petite and cheerful tone suddenly shifting to downright malicious; Kanna's often deadpan and monotone yet also innocent behavior to reflect awkward reactions to comedic effect; Lucoa's clueless but good-spirited demeanor; and Fafnir's overly-edgy and constant malignancy towards very silly and trivial activities. In addition to the rest of the cast, these characters work by fulfilling certain tropes only to then subvert your expectations of them completely when the time is right. The (original) voice actors even do a great job at portraying each character in very believable yet hilarious ways.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it doesn't just stop at the comedy. Over the course of the show, the characters tend to show some subtle hints of progression. Overtime, they start exhibiting tiny new changes as they learn from one another. Some recurring jokes in the show are delivered differently each time, by keeping what is necessary the same and changing what needs to be changed to keep them interesting, be it the delivery, the punchline, or how the characters react. Those same jokes help mirror just how much the characters have changed throughout the show's course. One of my least favorite moments is when the show tries to remind you by how much certain characters have changed, because it already does a good job at portraying that subtly without even needing to tell us directly.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the big elephant in the room is the relationship between Kobayashi and Tohru and how it's a big deal for lesbian, and potentially even queer or ace, leads. To some, this might be the whole point of the show or might be why so many praise it so much, but as someone who can't really identify with the characters from that avenue, I can only find it as a neat little bonus on top of an already-good show. However, I did pay attention to some of the smaller little hints the show exhibits for both our two main leads in terms of trying to examine certain subsets of people that often don't get enough exposure in entertainment, and I do appreciate the show all the more for doing so. I have friends who are heavily-invested in this show for feeling like they've been well-represented themselves, and if many others feel the same way, then this show is certainly doing something right.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the talk about diversity, the relationship is genuine. As both our leads continue to interact with one another, they start to accordingly modify their personalities or even exhibit opposite ones more akin to their partner's, to the point that they don't feel like the same people once the show is over. The show makes you feel the hardships they endure throughout their journey, eventually leading to a rather satisfying climax. Along the way, there are small cues here and there about how one feels about the other during certain scenarios, without completely revealing everything to the viewer. The characters can often be unpredictable but at the same time human, and they often can't fully explain why they feel a certain way yet those feelings resonate with the audience. Sure, some of their actions can be silly or cumbersome, but people in general do commit those actions inexplicably as well, so the characters aren't completely unbelievable but genuinely humane. I can safely say that this show handled its main romantic leads very well, and hopefully this show will be looked back to because of it.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of the stuff that I didn't like in the show, there's quite a few. Before I begin, I'll discuss some of the more controversial aspects of the show later.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest complaints is simply how, well, monotonous it can be at times. True, it is a slice-of-life and that is to be expected; however, I feel like this show needed quite a few more inventive scenarios rather than just \"beach episode\" or \"sports festival episode\" or \"friend's house\" episode. I've seen events like these in many other shows, and outside of character development, there's not really a whole lot interesting or new about them. Kobayashi's flat as well as the market they frequent contribute to 75% of the show's locales. Even if you do decide to stick to only a handful of locations, you could at least try to keep us more invested in the events and how they plan out, yet the show never does that. There's no real drive or motivation to suddenly be invested in the plot related to each specific event. I feel like this aspect is the weakest part about this show.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, there are definitely characters that needed more development, even if side characters. Kobayashi's friend from work is certainly the biggest candidate in dire need of development, immediately followed by Saikawa and Fafnir. I understand that the show is mostly centered around our leads, but we've already been given very interesting side characters that I would have loved to have known a lot more about, yet the show never takes that route. I guess one minor gripe is that the show could have shown us a lot more about Tohru's world, but I suppose that would completely change the whole point of the show; plus, we do get small glimpses of Tohru's past every once in a while. I just wished that I could see more, hell, maybe even from the other characters' points of views or even THEIR pasts too. Also, not a fan of the bits where the show tries to remind you how much the characters have changed overtime, because it already does a great job at showing that in subtle yet meaningful ways.\\n\\n\r\n[Disclaimer]\\n\r\nI do like this show, but one thing I should point out about this show is the controversial element surrounding it, which I feel could be a deal breaker to some people. Now it would seem that one of the characters is frequently used as the butt of many uncomfortable jokes due to her bust size. Some of these jokes can border around straight-up pedophilia. Perhaps jokes like these are generally acceptable by Japan's culture (I wouldn't know for sure), but for western cultures, some of these jokes can be seen in bad taste. I personally didn't mind them all that much despite finding them somewhat off, but the same can't be said about everyone. Some will be more accepting of those jokes, others even less so or would even prefer to avoid those jokes altogether. It's really up to you decide whether this would be a deal-breaker for you, or if you'd be fine with that content included.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon is quite an enjoyable comedy with a great romantic lead. While lacking in writing in some less-important areas, it manages to deliver a fun and charming story about the supernatural encountering the mundane. The romance in this show is genuinely-enjoyable with great writing and character development from start to end. With the recent influx of monster girls adapting to everyday life, I can definitely say that Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon is one of the better stand-out examples. A fulfilling show about a IT office nerd and her lover deudoragonist. Definitely worth checking out if it tickles you fancy.",

            "content": "Okay, to first start this review, I'm going to say that I absolutely LOVED this series, so I might be a tad bit biased. (I also apologize if I have rather bad grammar and weird paraphrasing)\r\nStory-10\r\nWhile it seems like a harem at first, a few busty dragon girls (exception being Kanna)traveling to a human world to see a human friend. Here's the thing, that friend is a business lady, not a high school dude. The amazing thing that this series did was that it captured the struggles of supernatural and normal human characters living in our modern world. It also captures the upsides and downsidesof our world and how we treat it . Well, I can't really put much more without spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nHoly shiets, the animation was amazing. It had the perfect color vibes. I never saw anything out of the ordinary or any bad animation. The backgrounds and fight scenes were amazing. Thankfully, none of the characters had same face syndrome. I can't really put much else into words.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nIt was a perfect for a slice of life anime. It amazingly brought you into the story. The voice acting (dub and sub) was good. Though I didn't like Kanna's English dub voice that much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nAll of the characters had perfect characterization. Their relationships were captured perfectly. They really made me laugh at lots of times and were extremely relatable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall-10\\n\r\nHonestly, this series amazed me. It was mainly comedy but there were some deep feelsy moments in there too. Even if you aren't a slice of life anime fan, you will really love this show. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Let's see...I only watched this anime because I saw one of my anime youtubers (Anme Man or Akidearest I forget) do a first impression of it. They didn't really say much about it, but I was intrigued by the plot summary. Now generally I don't like slice of life, and the fact that it looked like a cute girl anime only further lowered my expectations as I watched the first episode. But I was immediately hooked within minutes. \r\nIn many ways I was right. Yes, it was a slice of life anime, and yes, it had many cute girl elements. But something about it madeit so appealing. Maybe it was the fact that Kobayashi was completely disinterested with interacting with dragons, or maybe how endearing Tohru is. I think what I liked the best about this show was the character dynamics. Tohru, despite being so much more powerful than Kobayashi, and could easily destroy the planet, trying so hard to please and hilariously failing is interesting and very funny to see. I also loved the bromance of Fafnir and Takiya, though not much of their interactions is shown, the few bits that are featured are so dorky and awesome.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything in the show is all fun and rainbows though. Sprinkled throughout the episodes are moments that feel just the slightest bit off. Usually its through the inner monologue of one of the dragons, where they remind the viewer that what they are seeing could be easily broken. The dragons still hold so much power over the humans, and could easily kill everyone if rubbed the wrong way. But as the series progresses, you can see their views change a bit, and some of them actually starting to see humans as equals.\\n\\n\r\nI should stop rambling. Here are the other bits:\\n\\n\r\nStory - Not much of an umbrella plot, as expected of a slice of life anime, most of the show just shows some parts of the characters daily chaotic lives with dragons, which is equally amusing. I won't spoil, but by the end there is a more serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Their designs are what you would expect for a cute girl show, but there are some points where the animation really goes beyond what is needed. Very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Once again, what you would expect of a cute girl show, but it is the character dynamics that are really fun. Especially the growing relationship of Kobayashi and Tohru.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Seriously, this anime hooked me instantly. It's fun, bubbly, entertaining. What more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't like the SOL genre like I did, I still recommend this fully.",

But anyways because of it's comedic things in this, like for example Tooru always giving her tail meat to Kobayashi because she is very passionate, even though Kobayashi ends up rejecting her tail meat. The story was a good thrill of a life-time, with the mix of fantasy and realism mixed together. The characters are very good in my opinion, my favorite being Elma because of her constant eating habits and \"funny\" rivalry with Tooru. The enjoyment is really outstanding, because about it's comedic background, you can't just watch one episode without a laugh! My only complaints about this animeis more the repetitive jokes (aka running gags) it keeps coming, when you re-watch it over and over again, and the same jokes keeps on repeating, the comedic effect starts to sink.",

            "content": "Move out of the way, catgirls! We've got a new thing coming from Japan, and those are dragon girls! As if that's not enough, they've got dragon girls that are maids! In all seriousness, I first discovered this anime when I found out it was getting an anime adaptation; I was, at first, just slightly intrigued because of it being based off of the same mangaka as Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken, but when it was announced that Kyoto Animation would be the animation studio behind it, I decided that I was going to watch it for sure. I even read themanga to prepare myself for the anime, and it was rather amusing, to say the least. Despite all of this, however, I still wasn't prepared for exactly how good this anime was going to be.\\n\\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, dragon maids all around, here is my review of \"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\", known in English as \"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid\".\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon begins when Kobayashi, an office worker, finds a dragon standing at her door that day; the dragon then proceeds to transform into a cute girl with D (for dragon)-cup breasts and introduces herself as Tohru.  As it turns out, Kobayashi and Tohru met on the mountains one night when the former had taken a drunken excursion there and the latter got defeated and fled to this other world; seeing that she had nowhere to go, Kobayashi offers Tohru to live with her. As a result, Tohru has arrived to not only accept her offer, but she has also become her maid! Albeit reluctant at first, Kobayashi agrees to let Tohru stay. With Tohru around, it's needless to say that Kobayashi's life has gotten more interesting, especially with other dragons arriving in this world, too.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say this first, just to get it out of the way and prevent me gushing over it too much; the animation from Kyoto Animation is, once again, a sight to behold. With its fluid movement, simple (although simplicity is perfect for an anime like this) backgrounds, and cute character designs, it goes without question that the folks at KyoAni has provided excellent animation once more. The voice acting is pretty solid, too; the voice actors do their best with their respective roles, and not only do they succeed, they also seem to be having fun with their roles. The opening and ending themes, which are respectively \"Aozora no Rhapsody\" by fhana and \"Isshuukan Communication\" by Choro-gonzu (the seiyuus for Tohru, Kanna, Elma, and Lucoa), are also excellent songs that both fit this anime's atmosphere to a T.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it's rather simplistic; if you're looking for an anime that has both dragons and a complicated plot, you're not going to find the latter, so unless you're just going to settle for the dragons, I suggest looking elsewhere. It's not a huge problem for me, though; as a fan of slice of life anime, I enjoyed the story this anime had to tell. There were also quite a few jokes that were thrown my way that made me bust up laughing. For example, there is one running gag where one character, Saikawa, goes crazy for another character, Kanna, in certain situations; those moments never failed to make me laugh, especially because of the facial expressions she has as a result.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the driving force behind Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon, and that is its characters. Kobayashi is a rather standard protagonist, but even she has her moments of amusement; that, along with the strong bonds she has with Tohru, Kanna, and other characters in the series, made her a great character through my eyes. Tohru is also a fun character; her energetic personality and genuine determination to make Kobayashi happy make it easy for the audience to root for her. However, the best character is, without a doubt, Kanna; her antics are definitely adorable, and every time she was on screen, a smile never failed to grow on my face. There is also a great number of lovable supporting characters, such as Saikawa (for reasons I've already mentioned), Takiya, and Fafnir; all of the supporting cast have a role in bringing color and life to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon is an extremely well-executed anime. If you're in for a cute slice-of-life/fantasy anime, you're in for a real treat. After all, who can pass up dragon girls, especially if they're dragon maids?",

He's also responsible for \u201cDanna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken\u201d (transl.: I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying). Yes, it's probably the longest name for any TV series  in the world lately since \u201cDANMACHI\u201d and \u201cShomin Sample\u201d. If you're interested to have a look at this guy's works, you're into a quite big surprise. It includes fetishes like: loli, oppai, oppai loli, shota, more oppai, shota x oppai, and so on,and so on. Oh, and did I mention \u2018oppai\u2019 yet? You can find any of them in his mangas. Be it \u201cDanna ga Nani\u201d, \u201cOjojojo\u201d, \u201cOoya-san\u201d, \u201cKomori-san\u201d (that's \u2018oppai loli\u2019 for you), \u201cFullmapla\u201d, \u201cMononoke Sharing\u201d, \u201cFukumaden\u201d, \u201cChichi Chichi\u201d, \u201cMetsuko ni Yoroshiku\u201d, and last but not least, \u201cKobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\u201d (Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid). The last five works I just mentioned, which includes this anime, involves gigantic oppai which is the same one you'd probably seen in the BBW character from Occultic;Nine. In this particular show, the BBW one is a female with a big fuck-off tits, the loli is too airheaded and ecchi, and the lesbianism is covered in a multi-layers of \"plot\". Now we got all the negative points settled, back to business.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: skip to Overall paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nYou already read the synopsis. It's up to you whether you feel ridiculed or intrigued by it. There's one thing for sure about this anime: the plot executed properly, if not perfectly. As the story progresses, you'll get everything you need: who dragons are, who Kobayashi is, why the dragon becomes a maid and serves a master, how many dragons involved in the story, how things will turn out as the dragon and Miss Kobayashi are indulging in their master-and-maid relationship. The pace is right, not too slow or too quick. You can watch it without having a fear of being bored or losing something in the middle of it..  Already, the first episode took me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nl always felt uneasy about the plot, because there's nothing much to say in it: an ancient dragon turned itself into a maid and tries to serve fully to its master, the female office worker. If anything, in fact, I was genuinely worried this anime adaptation will turn out to be a complete disaster. I remember about what TMS Entertainment and 3xCube did last year to my favourite manga, Jitsu wa Watashi wa. It proves that no matter how good you think the original work would be, it won't do the viewers any good if the anime is an utter excrement. That gave me a severe trauma. However, as I watched it episode by episode, I can see that this anime is going very well with its execution. They managed to balance the unrealisticality of \"dragon maid\" plot by work it out together along with other essential elements, such as characters, soundtrack, animation, etc. Which is why, I'm glad to say that this show has a story everyone can easily follow. Notice how I said \"everyone\" instead of \"every anime viewer\". I gave this anime 7/10 for the Story section, which is \"Good\".\\n\\n\r\nWe got the story section out of the way, now it's the Art section. It\u2019s Kyoto Animation we\u2019re talking about. Therefore, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. They always did a great job on the animation department, even in Myriad Colors Phantom World last year (god, it was awful).  The animation is not Makoto-Shinkai-ly, where it makes everything alive and you'd have to watch it in Full Ultra HD screen or something, but it's still as dynamic and eye-refreshing as you'd expect from KyoAni. Nothing special in the art style, except that it'll remind you of Danna ga Nani once again in some way and it's much more colorful than it. I was doubtful whether to give the Art section a 7/10, or 6/10 which is \"Mediocre\". However, I'm quite sure everyone including me agrees that this section deserves 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure if I could say the soundtrack is mediocre, but I know very well that it's quite well-fitting for this anime within every episode by episode. If it could get any better, I'd be willingly to give it an 8/10, which is \"Very Good\". For now, however, 7/10 would be acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Character section, we have 2 main course: An ordinary female office programmer named Kobayashi who works in office daily, and the hundreds-of-years old female dragon serves as Kobayashi's maid in a female human body dressed in maid outfit named Tooru. Tooru is a dragon which, like most of the dragons in the past, has very terrible and complicated experiences with humans, and makes her have her own opinions about them. Living with Kobayashi, however, will change her perspectives about humans. This is probably where things turn to be better or uglier, which all depends on how Miss Kobayashi; an especially total maid maniac, heavy drunkard, and hard-working daily-routine female office worker; will try to change Tooru with her nurturing and solid resolves. As the story goes, you\u2019ll find a lot of other characters as well, which mostly are Tooru\u2019s relatives. Looking at the characters and their background stories, you might think this is a very seriously tense anime, especially when the protagonists have serious characteristics too, but not quite so. As I said earlier, everything is balanced. There's a high chance you'll fall in love with this anime and all the characters in it. The character in-depths is well-shown in every single appearing character, you\u2019ll always find a place for them in your heart and keep it in. I think 9/10 should be a reasonable score in this section.\\n\\n\r\nIn my objective point of view, I gave this show an Enjoyment of  8/10. I'd been watching all the episodes without getting my eyes diverted to somewhere else except my computer screen. That\u2019s how much I enjoy it. It makes you laugh, happy, stunned, impressed, tragic, overwondered, pitied, delighted, etc. All sorts of emotions mix you\u2019d expect from a comedy-fantasy anime. Strangely, with all those emotions, you can\u2019t help but also amazed by how it\u2019s all well-executed perfectly just like how the manga did it. Even when there\u2019s some additional scenes in the anime that\u2019s not in the manga, everything\u2019s still presented brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYea, I get it. That \u201cloli\u201d and \u201clesbianism\u201d is just too much for a joke. Apart from those two things, however, the rest is true. I mean, c\u2019mon, dat boobs doe.\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually a fan of Kyou-Shinja's works; if not a fan of the guy himself. All those weird fetishes depicted in his works aside, his mangas are worth the read. I also fell in love with this anime. Because this show is presumably, if not absolutely, his most successful anime adaptation. I\u2019m so happy knowing my favorite manga turned into a successful anime with many positive reviews. The first paragraph you jusr read is a little bit of reminder I made about what you\u2019d expect from Cool Kyou-shinja, but I was trying to make it as offensive as possible for the greater good. I mean, there could probably be some of anime viewers who hates oversized tits or something. So I was just kind of trying to sort them out. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my overjoyness, I know my responsibility as a reviewer. I changed all the scores in the midway as objective as possible. That being said, as you can probably read, I also already did my fair share with the negative points at first paragraph above. You can see the positive points in my review, ones I tried to reveal as much as possible, along with my objectivity as a reviewer in it.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you want an anime about daily life and fantasy at the same time with some relieving comedy, a little bit of sick \u201cdragon action\u201d, and obviously good chibi-looking animation in it, you must try this. This is not like your ordinary dragon stories you\u2019ve ever heard about. This is about Miss Kobayashi and her \u201cDragon Maid\u201d.\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT!!!!\r\nDragons are usually viewed as ferocious, big, and scary lizard-like beings with wings.\r\nNot in this anime. While they're still ferocious, they are also cute and playful in this anime. The dragons in this anime can turn into humans so that they can blend in.\r\nThere is not much of a story. It's just random events that happen in each episode. But it is those random events the build up the relationship between Kobayashi and the dragons that she encounters, especially Tohru (a green dragon). The story was about Kobayashi, a programmer, that was drunk one night,met Tohru in the mountains, Tohru was injured with a big sword in her back and she saved Tohru by pulling that sword out of Tohru's back (how does Kobayashi have that much strength?!), they then bonded over drinks realizing they were both lonely, and letting Tohru stay with her at her place as a maid. As the story progress, more dragons (Tohru's friends) come into Kobayashi's life. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI love this art and it's authenticity. The art style looks calm, clean, and more \"fresh\" than any other anime. What I mean by \"fresh\" is that in some sceneries, the apartment for example, looks like it was drawn without converting it into the style used in most anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. There's nothing to complain here. The opening song is pretty catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime are really unique:\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi: A female programmer (I'm a programmer too!) who works in an office and works hard. She is kind and gets wild while drunk (she drinks a lot). She has a huge fascination with maids. She is kind of a slob as she leaves her clothes laying around. She was living by herself before meeting Tohru. She shows her feelings for Tohru when facing Tohru's father.\\n\\n\r\nTohru: A female dragon who moved to Earth, becomes Kobayashi's maid, and learns Earth's customs, what's right and wrong. She is a part Chaos faction from her world. She is commonly mistaken for a cosplayer in the human world. After meeting Kobayashi, she has a crush on her.\\n\\n\r\nKanna: A female dragon and a friend of Tohru who moved to Earth because she got exiled from her world for being a prankster. Reason why she was pranking other dragons was she wanted her parents to notice her.\\n\r\nShe can't go back to her world due to not having enough magic. She also grew fond of Kobayashi and thinks of Kobayashi as her mother.\\n\\n\r\nElma: A female water dragon who is a part of the Order faction which is rivaled with the Chaos faction. She came to Earth and tried to get Tohru back to their world. When trying to bring Tohru back, she decided to battle Tohru which Tohru tricked into going to the place that Kanna and Tohru played, and then closing the portal. When she got back, she was unable to go back to her world so she worked with Kobayashi. She is often swayed by food.\\n\\n\r\nQuetzalcoatl: A dragon ex-goddess that's one of Tohru's friend. She lost her status due to being drunk and sleeping with her sister. She came to Earth because she was curious about Tohru and how she was doing. Hey nickname is Lucoa.\\n\\n\r\nFafnir: A male dragon who's another friend of Tohru. He distrusted humans until he met Kobayashi's friend a co-worker, Makoto Takiya, who introduced him to video games. He's a shut-in in both his world and Earth. He has an aloof attitude.\\n\\n\r\nRiko Saikawa: A friend of Kanna from her primary school. When she first met Kanna, she was jealous of how popular Kanna was when Kanna first started school. Kanna then became friends with her and they became closer. Every time she makes physical contact with Kanna, she gets overly excited (What's wrong with her?! She's just a little girl!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I loved the catchy opening, all the characters, and the art style and animation of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this gets a 9/10.\\n\r\nThis is a MUST watch! Even if the story is alright.\\n",

            "content": "Now that Anime winter 2017 has officially come to an end, I would like to say, personally, that this season will come out strong not only as a comedy season for shows such as; Konosuba, Demi-chan wa kataritai, Gabriel dropout but also strong dramatic season shows such as; Kuzo no Honkai, 3-gatsu no lion and some might say Youjo senki. \r\nBut I am getting off the rail here so please come with me and let us explore this anime, which spawns countless memes and trends that made anime fun again. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you. Kobayashi-san chi no Maid dragon \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThestory of Maid dragon is neither ground breaking nor lazy to a lot of degrees. For some, they might find it as generic. \\n\r\nWe have a working age, female who is a maid enthusiast. Who one day through a rough night of drinking encountered a dragon, she saved the dragon and ask her to be a maid. Now if you read this summary you might think to yourself. That's...pretty generic. But trust me, without spoiling anything, it gets better. \\n\r\nThe show centers on the daily life of the dragon who tried to adjust to the environment around her. It also portrays how the working class (office employee) in Japan looks like, with the cramp train before and after work, stressful environment and etc. At first you might come in for cute anime girls do cute anime thing but when you look closer to the issues that were brought up in this anime, it can also be applied to real-life scenarios and that you will learn from it and value this anime more. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nWith the polish of the anime company KyoAni, The visuals and fluidity of the show in each episode comes out as flawless. Each character's movement, design and almost perfect adaptation from the manga with the same name. It stands to be one of the pretty shows in this season. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\r\nWith the story and the tone of this anime. The Soundtrack for Maid dragon is of course cheerful and jolly. From the catchy OP to the cute ED. With sound effects during the comedic scenes that help in carrying the show forward. The voice acting is also on point with the animation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 \\n\r\n\"Don't lewd the dragon loli\" This quote has been floating around the internet for the past couple of months and that is because of one of the characters in the show, But we'll get to her later. All of the characters in this anime, especially the dragons have their own different tastes and development with some exception((I am looking at you Elma)) \\n\r\nOf course, with the title name,\u2019Kobayashi-san\u2019 as a character develops from a lonely shut in to somewhat of a mother figure to both of the dragons that live with her. She is strict to the dragons and at the same time gives them kindness that warms my heart. \\n\r\nTooru, with her development as a maid, her understanding of human society and her relationship with Kobayashi-san which starts off as somewhat of lust, ends with love and respect for her. \\n\r\nNow to everyone\u2019s favorite dragon, Kanna. As the main cute blob in the series, she is not there only to be cute and useless(as to some other anime with cute blob). . . ok fine I like her cute character. But also she can be show her power. Although we can assume that she is at least more than a centuries old, but her physical and mental capacity are still that of a kindergarten\u2019s and her desire for wanting to learn more and live in the human society motivated her to study in human world. There are more characters in this anime that I want to talk about, like fafnir development from a Human hatred machine to a shut-in Otaku to Lucuo with her outrageous \"plot\". But I will say the character in this anime with their unique interaction and personality are what moves this anime forward. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nI have to be honest with you guys here. I had a very bad impression on this anime to the point that I avoided the first 3 episodes. But then I looked back, watched it and was hooked with all the things that I just wrote on this review. I would say, give it a go! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\nAs for the end I would say that Maid dragon is like a cheap-looking food that you try to avoid but then submit yourself to and realize how wrong you were for trying to avoid it with an ungodly craving for that food to the point where you want more. It gives you that laugh when it\u2019s funny and a reality hit scares you when the scene gets serious, I would say, give it a go. \\n\r\n-Fresh26564 was here",

            "content": "If you said to me a few months ago that Dragon Maid was actually a good show I think I would've honestly slapped you in the face.  The preview was on my Tumblr page and I remember internally groaning at Tohru turning into a maid with that freaking boob jiggle and thinking \"this is shit\"  Like out of all the things I would watch it wouldn't be this right?\r\nBut yet here I am prepared to talk to you about why you really do need to watch Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid and how much of a goddamn fun experience this anime is.  Solets get this over with!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that I think most people will definitely love about this series is its surprisingly great writing and humour.  Most of the time the jokes just really landed for me and it wasn't ever really a dull moment.  The show also understands the use of running jokes and makes sure to put them in with great comedic timing, they land well and they don't go on forever to the point that they become dull.  Its just great.  Besides the comedy the writing in general is really something awesome as well.  It had some really charming and well written moments that just left me surprised at how well done they were.  One of my favourites i'd think would actually be episode 12.  Its charm for me was just full force their and it truly did remind me of how great the series is.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing of course is the characters cause these were some great characters, especially the dragons.  First there's our title character Ms. Kobayashi.  She presents as the most relatable character in my opinion. Her views, thoughts and actions felt organic and was a character I could really enjoy.  Then their's of course our other title character the Dragon Maid Tohru.  Tohru is honestly just such a bright and bubbly personality all on her own.  Although she sort of fills in the \"being from another world\" trope thats quite apparent  you see her easily fitting through society while still maintaining that bubbly personality.  She wants to do her best at her job and impress Kobayashi and be with her.  Its great and such a pleasure seeing her succeed, fail and try again and it can really make you want to see her more.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kobayashi and Tohru, lets talk about their amazing dynamics.  In all honesty these two have the feel of some sweet and doting couple okay.  The two have honestly the best interactions, both of them learning more things about life from each other and it provides for some great development, especially on Tohru's part as you see her growing slowly from her disdain of humans.  If the series was solely their interactions I'd still probably watch it as that alone will make me love it.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those two their's also one more main character I'd like to talk about: Kanna.  Who's basically the adorable little character in the series everyone loves and is pretty much kobayashi and Tohru's adopted daughter.  While the cute characters aren't necessarily the ones i enjoy she was still great and I loved her so much.  Such a smol child.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those main three the series also has some fun side characters like the dragons, my personal favourite being Fafnir, his whole persona of hating everyone and being the hugest gamer was great and kind of made me laugh.  Then their's also some of the human characters who while aren't as entertaining as the human ones were still pretty fun as well.  My favourite being Saikawa and her adorable crush on Kanna.\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS since I've talked so much about the characters lets talk about something thats truly amazing: the animation and art.  Sure its no surprise that it was gonna be good (its a kyoani show what else would you expect) but it still left me in so much awe.  The bright and colourful artwork and backgrounds just really bring out the brightness of this world and Dragon Maid's upbeat tone.  Like I could stare at these backgrounds all day cause of how great they look.  And then there's the animation itself which HOLY SHIT its just a beauty, the movements, the flow, everything is just so great.  Hell the series had a few fight scenes and i swear they could beat some action series with how great they are like damn.  Good on you Dragon Maid.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also pretty great as well.  There's this one track that appears in pretty much every episode and its just so calming to hear.  I wish I knew the name just so I could listen to it over and over again.  Voice acting is also pretty top notch as well if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nI think if their's anything that really feels lackluster for me its definitely Lucoa's character, who's basically just one huge boob joke.  The scenes with her just really felt gross and uncomfortable at times and really hindered some of my enjoyment for the series,  plus I'll admit that the show can be quite pandering at times, like I know its expected but still, its just really not cool.  I'll also admit that at times I did feel bored, especially between episodes 7 and 10.\\n\\n\r\nHowever despite those flaws Dragon Maid is great.  It was some of the most enjoyable weeks I had in watching a series and man would I just love to see more.  While I don\"t think everyone will necessarily enjoy it I know that a lot of people will, myself included.  And so with all the good I have to say i think this series definitely deserves a 9/10",

I would love it to make a 2nd season and continue the plot in the manga since the manga is in great development in my opinion despite the drawing style.\r\nThe anime would give to any of you who want to live alone or living alone the feeling of an independent lifestyle. The sensation of \"whereto belong\" is heart-touching and for me the different meaning of \"family\". \\n\r\nThe ending was a  mixed of emotions. I wasn't able to cried but sad inside but also laugh too.",

            "content": "Cute. Affable. Brilliant. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid.\r\nAt the point of this review, Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is one episode off from concluding. And, I feel confident that my ratings for this show will completely stay the same. The only way that would change is for KyoAni to completely botch the last episode, but that seems wholly unlikely.\r\nEdit: Epsiode 13 is not as good as previous episodes, but it doesn't change my opinion of the series.\r\nTL:DR: Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon is a blissfully, beautiful anime about what it means to be a family. Its not the most groundbreaking anime, but it is something that I believe everyone could enjoy, ifyou can look past the dragons and overt fan-service. This is my 2nd best anime of Winter 2017, and is a strong argument for a possible resurgence of Kyoto Animation. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kobayashi's Dragon Maid follows the lives of its three main characters Kanna, Tohru, and Kobayashi. While, it does take their lives, generally, one giant plot point at time (examples: cultural assimilation and school). Its story actually creates a wholesome argument about what it means to be a family, which this anime argues is that families are created from groups of people who instinctively can tell each other they love and trust one another. The best episode that envisions comes from revolves around the idea of family is episode 8 (written by Fumihiko Shimo) and 9 (written by Director Yasuhiro Takemoto), where the focus revolves around the Mother-Daughter dynamic between Kanna and Kobayashi. While, I enjoy the theme and importance of family to the story of this anime. It is definitely not a unique topic that has been tried and tested to great success with other anime like Sweetness and Lightning, The Eccentric Family, and Fruits Basket. Each of those anime gave their own perspective of the idea of family that I thought was more unique when I compare them to Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon.  However, the reason the story still gets a 9 is because the story flows incredibly well and the dialogue between the characters is extremely funny to listen to. Watch the beginning of episode 8 to understand what I mean or the magic show scene in episode 5. These scenes represent some of the best Kobayashi has to offer in terms of character dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nI would be remiss though if I did not talk about the filler episodes such as the Beach Episode and Comiket. Both of these episodes drag the viewer away from this wholesome story and devolve the show into a more fan-service orientation. Not to say that those episodes were bad, it was just something that I wish those script and screenwriters could have still revolved this idea of family, instead of just going for fan-service and comedy. Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon's story may not be the most ground-breaking or thought-provoking, but executes its theme with grace and nice comedic taste.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon is exactly where anyone should expect Kyoto Animation's to be. It's cute, glossy with bright colors, and flows extremely well from scene to scene. Additionally, like KyoAni fashion, its opening is breathtaking beautiful. The opening few seconds where the backgrounds shift out of focus before snapping into character portraits not only introduces us to the main characters of the show, but sets the viewer up well to understand that this is going to be a quirky, fun show. There are a few times in the middle episodes where Tohru's animations tend to get a bit too stiff. But, is not disruptive enough to cause big problems. Dragon-Maid's art gets a thumbs up from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon is more or less forgettable. The opening and ending for this show is incredibly catchy, and the cute sound effects that accompanies Tohru and Kanna really add a childish dimension to their character. However, the sound in this anime is probably its weakest point because it only has a couple standout tracks with a great opening track from fHana and a fun ending track from the female VAs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nMaid-Dragon completely banks on its characters for the entire series to propel itself into success because it aims to be a pure comedy, slice-of-life. Therefore, the focus of the anime is based on the antics and reactions of the characters in its story. Kobayashi's definitely kill it, and are extremely hilarious to watch from episode 1 to episode 12. They are not completely unique by any degree because some characters like Kanna resemble Renge (Non Non Biyori) and Kobayashi resembles any working mother. From that standpoint, it should make the characters in this anime rather bland because of their lack of unique character design. Except, the VAs did a great job at creating evocative characters and their reactions to make them easy to relate to and funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nKobayashi's Maid-Dragon came out of left field. This show, on the outside, looks like a standard, boring slice-of-life with comedic aspects. Except, Kyoto Animation's director Yasuhiro Takemoto brought life into this project by having an anime that talks about what makes a family, including its ups and downs. The story is also masterfully chereographed in tandem with the brilliant visuals that people should expect to come Kyoto Animation. Therefore, this anime asks the question is it time for KyoAni to come back into a top 5 animation studio with the likes of Ufotable, Ghibli, Madhouse, and Bones? Or, is their current sprees of success (A Silent Voice, Sound Euphonium, and Free) just a stint of success before falling back down into a position of 6-10? I would argue that Kobayashi's Maid-Dragon makes a strong argument that Kyoto Animation wants to become a top 5 animation studio.",

            "content": "\"Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon\" takes a very unique stance on CGDCT (Cute girls doing cute things) style of anime. The concept of adorable humanoid dragons living the daily life of a normal human may seem quite odd at first, but turns out to be a great concept for an adorable anime that will have you smiling the whole time.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIt's funny, It's cute, It's creative. This basically sums up this anime. There really isn't any \"backstory\" but rather just throws you into the hectic life of living with a dragon maid and her friends. Although it seems like a whole jumble of confused ideas,it flows nicely into a heartwarming comedy of just pure joy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe simplistic art style keeps this anime clean looking and fresh, but functional at the same time providing an easy experience on the viewer without providing too many blown up and explosive details (sort of). Clearly making sure that the viewer remembers that most of the characters are indeed dragons, you see vibrant short-lived displays of fire, explosions, etc. (relation back to the \"sort of\"). Having a wide variety of personalities in the anime makes it for nice different character design all around and overall, works quite well with the rest of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI like the OT and ED, like, I REALLY LIKE THE OT AND ED. Skippy and upbeat they launch the viewer into the carefree world that the characters are living in and drives home the \"daily life of humanoid dragons\" idea. Aside from that, the actual soundtrack doesn't really resonate with me which is made up for by all the moe more kyun momments :).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nDear lord, they're all so cute and squishy and KYAAAAAAA. *ahem*. The characters in this anime are truly unique to the anime. Although yes they are \"moe-blob\", \"edgy emo-guy\", etc., for some reason they just work well with the anime in general. They each bring their own personalities to the table and its fun to see them interact with one another in a very calm setting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nHonestly, there's really nothing I can say about this anime that I didn't enjoy. I like the characters, music (for the most part), and the art style. It just works well together to create a feel good anime that can give you a break from you're typical fast-paced action or depression beyond belief type of anime. Honestly its just a happy anime in general.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n7 Episodes in, I'm loving it. At the beginning I felt a bit in the dark about some aspects of the plot but overall, it comes together quickly into a very cute and happy anime that I'm sure many people can enjoy, but also many might dislike.",

            "content": "I don't know if there is any other media in the world that could possibly pull off the things anime get away with. I just like to imagine a Hollywood production company trying to pitch a story about a dragon that turns into a cute little girl and wants to be the best maid there ever was to a room of TV show producers. Anime is truly an art that has mastered the ways of traversing the thin line between insanity and brilliance. Although, this isn't to say that there is anything particularly brilliant about Kobayashi san chi no Maid Dragon, but it is definitelybrings out the sunshine after a long, dreary day. \\n\\n\r\nIn a world of moe with a sea of anime about cute girls doing cute things, how exactly does Kobayashi san chi no Maid Dragon (for short I'll call it simply \"Kobayashi san\" for the duration of this review) stand out from other shows similar to its premise? To be honest, there isn't too much different from many of the others considering it isn't the first to have cute girls who are actually a creature or beast of some sort that just happened to fall in love with some human who for whatever reason is constantly compelled to reject their love while keeping them around out of charity until love slowly blossoms in them as well. But while this is the formula that constitutes the premise of the show, Kobayashi san does take liberties with some minor details including the sex of the recipient of the cute girl's love. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"hero\" of our story, who is the one the audience is meant to project themselves onto thus emulating a feeling of ourselves being the recipient of the cute girl's emotions, is a woman herself. Yuri isn't uncommon but I rarely see it used in this formula which was originally designed as male fantasy. This small tweak is in its own way a great tactic to expanding the audience because it includes both male and female viewers into the fantasy. The reason for this is the design and character of Kobayashi, who while being a female doesn't act like any other female characters in this show as she can appear very masculine and has less articulated sexuality in her appearance. At the same time, there are clear visual indications that Kobayashi is female (example: pony tail). Also, her reserved attitude, often silent demeanor, and her small eyes give her a sort of grey slate where she is allotted enough character to let her feel like her own person while also giving the audience some space to project their own self image onto her. She isn't bound too heavily to her masculinity or femininity, but she doesn't lack these to the point where she feels genderless and sterile. Her being a woman also gives a reasonable excuse to deny the cute girl's loving advances because she did not indicate being homosexual; this kind of trope is harder to pull off with male characters because it usually requires some sort of plot devise to keep him distant (the same could be said for clearly homosexual women). Other than this nice little tweak, Kobayashi doesn't add much else to the show other than being a sort of stand-in for the audience. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the show's true charm is brought in with the other titular character, the Maid Dragon. Named Tohru, she is a dragon who falls in love with Kobayashi when she met her drunk and in the mountains. Kobayashi drunkenly invites her to live at her place and is later obligated to allow Tohru to live with her working as a maid. The rest of the show doesn't stray too far from this original concept and the episodes are mainly dedicated to displaying Tohru's endearing efforts to become the best maid she possibly can and the people and situations that come with what that entails. The character of Tohru truly makes this show by being a positive and outgoing girl with a past depicted from the image of RPG fantasy dragons and their violent relationship with humans creating a sense of new perspective on a familiar setting. Tohru's past is clearly stated but we learn enough of what we need to know to understand and feel emotional connection to her, and Tohru's bias of humans, shaped by these past events, add for some nice little moments of growth and development for her along the way as she observes how Kobayashi interacts in society. There are a few nice points in the show that define and demonstrate the inner workings of human society in a way that Tohru can understand and learn from which allows her to grow into the lovable dragon maid she is towards the end of the season. \\n\\n\r\nThese are all mostly positive points on the show, but there are certainly negatives that I need to address. My first, small critique is on Kanna, the young loli dragon that appears immediately after Tohru. In contrast to Tohru's energetic expressiveness, I believe Kanna does add a nice opposite by being straight faced and monotone and the animators know exactly how to articulate this to match her childish nature to make the ultimate machine of cuteness. However, I do find it rather off-putting when I feel like the show is attempting to sell her look sexually even though she is only in elementary school. Her design is a bit too curvy and flashy for a child of her age and the directing attempts to utilize her looks as a means of enticing the viewer. I don't have a problem with cute little girls, I just simply have difficulty appreciating her slight sexual nature. \\n\\n\r\nMy second critique is a bit wider as it can encompasses a few of the most recent episodes. I really enjoyed the beginning up until the middle as I felt it had charm, personality, and a unique voice. Unfortunately, the show continues and some episodes end up as manufactured arcs that appear in most other shows of this genre (i.e. beach episode, Christmas episode, new year's episode, hot spring episode, etc.). This feels like Kobayashi san is going off of a template limiting itself to the 'tried and true' design of its predecessors. There is definitely lost potential in these episodes as they often end up being the standard having fun with the friend group and ending on a heart-warming note with not much substance in between. The best jokes and funny moments are only in the beginning with the show losing some of the comical momentum and relying more on dialogue and static situations between friends. This isn't necessarily a bad thing considering the Comiket episode was fairly enjoyable. But the other episodes just can't help but fall short of the more original events of the earlier ones. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, Kobayashi san still carries a wonderful and charming feeling of energy and pleasure that makes each episode leaving you warm and fuzzy inside. Overall, I definitely think Kobayashi san is in the top 3 new anime this season and is worth a visit to those who have yet to try it.",
