            "content": "If you are in anyway a fan of yuri anime, then Strawberry Panic is a bit of a rite of passage for entry into the genre.  It probably garners the highest amount of fanaticism and emotionalism from its supporters and detractors.  Though I wouldn\u2019t call it a love or hate it kind of show as you might expect from that.  I think of myself as a reasonably objective person and found that my opinion of it split almost right down the middle between absolute love and complete contempt.\r\nStrawberry Panic's story centers on a new student to a prestigious all girls\u2019 school, NagisaAoi.  The school is divided into three separate campuses which operate separately, have different uniforms, but are functionally really the same institution.  Oh, and basically the entire student body are lesbians... hey this is yuri after all!  There isn\u2019t any amazing drama or nefarious villains as the story almost totally revolves around relationship angst.  The story walks the line on being a light hearted romantic comedy to having some pretty deep drama but for the most part it is a lot of fun.  I would imagine most people are going to enjoy it a lot, until you get to the last five to six episodes.  Here is where there is likely to be disagreement amongst viewers as pairings finalize and plot twists emerge.  This is where my enjoyment also suffered, because I intensely disliked almost every final pairing and the ending to the final story arc itself left me quite angry and disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have some magnificent highs but also some annoying lows.  As far as Nagisa goes, whom just about every important plotline flows through, she is a sweet and likable character.  Immediately people are going to gravitate to her much as characters do in the story and find something to like about her.  However as the story unfolds, I found her becoming increasingly unlikable and idiotic.  The decisions she makes, her inability to see the obvious right in front of her face, and her ditzy nature (while extremely endearing at the beginning of the series) becomes annoying and tired.  You want to feel for her angst and conflict but in the end you're just so over with her.\\n\\n\r\nShizuma, next to Nagisa, is the most important character in the story and probably the most interesting.  Though that doesn\u2019t mean she is particularly likable.  A friend once referred to her as the \"Mac-Daddy\" of the school.  She seems willing to go after any girl in the school while seemingly not really caring about them or the consequences of her actions.  Her past is tragic and explains the reasons why she is the way she is.  But she is a psychologically damaged person and hurts a lot of people along the way, though probably not intentionally.  She simply just can\u2019t help it.  While she does make a lot of progress and matures some over the story I still couldn\u2019t help but think that in the end in her heart of hearts she really hadn\u2019t changed.\\n\\n\r\nTamao is the last of the main cast.  She will be instantly likable by all though will not come across as a terribly unique character in the annals of anime history.  As the other love interest for Nagisa, this is where viewers of the show are going to start to separate themselves.  You\u2019re going to be a Tamao fan or a Shizuma one.  Depending on which character you find yourself rooting for is likely to affect the way you view the anime in the end.  I did like her, though she has a lot of Nagisa's personality traits and her ditzy nature does get annoying towards the end\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad and it pretty much starts and ends for me with Amane and Hikari.  Amane is the stereotypical character we seem to always have forced on us in anime.  The emotionless robot who happens to be admired by all despite having no personality and looking and dressing like a man.  Yes, this is YURI; I am watching it for the girls!  So what is this mannish toad-face doing in my show!  I found absolutely nothing redeeming about her and the only reason I could even think of that all these girls revered her so much was that at an all girls school she was the most likely to have a sausage in her pants.  This all being said, it seems fitting that she is linked with the second worst character in the show, Hikari.  Hikari is basically a functional retard.  She has no personality attributes besides being moe to the extreme that would make anyone care about her.  She spends all of her time in constant angst over what Amane thinks of her and ignores the people who truly care about her (though heaven only knows why they do).  Honestly I think if nobody guided her along and told her when to wake up and eat she would just stand in the corner and starve to death.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is actually pretty good.  Yaya and Chikaru stand out above all the others.  I would liked to have seen both of those characters get better endings and felt they were ignored a bit too much.  Almost everyone would be considered likable and friendly, the kind of people you would want to be friends with.  The only exception would be Kaname and Momomi.  I really found them to be despicable characters and their actions and motivations were pretty hard for me to stomach.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is exceptional.  I really enjoyed the beautiful settings and costumes and with the exception of Amane, all of the girls were quite stunning to look at.  The voice acting and music was also very good.  A few of the character voices grated on me, but mostly because they were characters I didn\u2019t like. (Hikari, Amane)  The OP and EN songs were performed by Nagisa's and Tamao's voice actress and I thought fit the theme and feel of the show wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of Strawberry Panic is going to greatly depend on how you felt about the final pairings.  Some people are really going to like this a lot and others are going to feel very disappointed as I was.  In addition I very much disliked how the final arc played out and that several key characters basically got the shaft in terms of their own romances.  It\u2019s a fun show for the most part, required viewing for yuri fans and probably one of the better shows of the genre out there.  That in itself is an indictment of yuri anime.\\n",

If you really want an anime that you can get into whole heartedly it is this one. The in depth analysis on all the variety of characters makes it so you can relate to at least one of them. The play on suspense, romance, and other relationships is so perfect for anyone who is into anything that may make your eyes tear up.",

            "content": "I really should not have enjoyed this series nearly as much as I did. As a bit of a technical story snob, I usually find that well-animated and voiced series with somewhat weak storylines tend to rate quite poorly with me. I find myself dropping them, or rating them well below a seven, but this series just has that something compelling about it that makes you enjoy it thoroughly-- despite some glaring problems with the plot. If I had to sum this series up in two words, it would quite easily be: Guilty pleasure. \r\nIt is one of a very small number of series thatI can watch repeatedly and still enjoy quite a bit, despite my somewhat low 'overall' score. As you can see, I found this series ridiculously entertaining which--for me--is sometimes more important than a good technical overall score. \\n\\n\r\nPossibly the weakest part of this series was the plot. It was, at times, ridiculous, superficial, far-fetched, full of cheese and melodrama, but still oddly compelling. If it were a novel, the story would most likely be in a two-dollar bin in your local book store, yet there is somehow still enough substance buried in there to keep it afloat. Despite all I may say about the plot there are some truly touching moments buried in there -- and those are the little gems that keep you wanting more, despite yourself. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially the plot is separated into two mini-stories: The main following bumbling transfer-student Aoi Nagisa from Miator, and the secondary following Konohana Hikari, a timid choir-girl from Spica. While the majority of the plot centres around Nagisa, there is enough material from Hikari's story to keep you entertained if you find yourself uninterested by the protagonist's antics. \\n\\n\r\nWith healthy doses of fluff and comedy, hefty smearings of romance and the odd tragic moment or two, there is certainly enough going on to keep the plot from idling. It was just a slight pity that they couldn't inject just a little more substance to enable me to rate it a little higher. \\n\\n\r\nVisually this series is quite beautiful. While not on par with KyotoAni's breath-taking animation, gorgeous scenery, dynamic colours and interesting character designs, it makes for quite the pleasant viewing experience. That said-- there are times when the artwork looks a little awkward, though fortunately they are few and far between. And if you can quickly adjust to the stick-thin legs and arms that are common in this series, the character designs are quite striking, of special note are Hanazono Shizuma and Minamoto Chikaru, though with an ensemble cast of well over twelve there is bound to be at least one design to find pleasing. \\n\\n\r\nMusically, Strawberry Panic is neither ground-breaking nor particularly breath-taking, yet there is a simplicity in the classical tracks that fit with the setting and overall tone of the series. Seiyuu performances are rather exquisite, with a cast consisting of: Nabatame Hitomi, Nakahara Mai, Shimizu Ai, Noda Junko and Kuwatani Natsuko there is more than enough skill to inject feeling into sometimes two-dimensional characters. Certainly there are some emotional scenes that are simply made by the skill of these masterful seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this series is made of an ensemble cast, but unfortunately they tend to be rather two-dimensional or stereotypical characters. That said, there is a wonderfully subtle build-up in a few of the characters that really does surprise, and you can't help but empathise with your favourites as they are put through an emotional blender. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it all I found myself strangely addicted to this series. Yes, the plot is weak, uses cliche plot progressions, makes no sense at times and is borderline ridiculous, yet I found it to be one of the most entertaining series in my collection. The chemistry between the characters, some brilliant work by the cast and some truly spectacular scenes mean that I enjoyed this series for what it was-- mindless fun. By episode twenty-six, I was more than disappointed that this series was over, and I would have to go elsewhere to find my fix of cheesy-goodness. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a deep and sophisticated plot in a similar vein, watch Maria-sama ga Miteru; if you want hours of cheesy, light-hearted goodness: Sit down, buckle in and prepare to turn off your brain and watch something that will have you going through severe withdrawal when it is all over.",

            "content": "For my first yuri, it wasn&rsquo;t as shocking or surprising as I thought it would be. I guess it&rsquo;s because of the look and feel of the anime &ndash; the girls didn&rsquo;t really look like they would engage in such &ldquo;activities&rdquo; &ndash; they all looked very innocent and sweet. It&rsquo;s a good thing the anime focused more on the dramatic side than sex scenes. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of sex scenes too, which is a huge sigh of relief for me.\r\nPoor Nagisa. She&rsquo;s obviously straight when she first came in and Shizuma had to corrupt her mind. I don&rsquo;t get how Shizuma would fall forsomeone like Nagisa though. Nagisa is one ditzy girl and Shizuma&rsquo;s elegant and classy (with stone cold glances and stares too). I felt like Nagisa would have been better off with Tamao, and Shizuma with Rokujou. Hikari and Amane were a more convincing couple &ndash; mostly because Amane actually looks like a guy and Hikari&rsquo;s very ladylike. \\n\\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s a part of me that still can&rsquo;t believe there were no male characters throughout the entire series. It reminded me even more of the 11 years I went to an all girls school wherein males are a rare commodity. I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed with the characters, because they didn&rsquo;t have much depth in them, so I&rsquo;m thought how interesting it would be if at least one guy showed up. They all had similar personalities too &ndash; with the exception of the older students such as Shizuma, Rokujou and Amane. Chikaru was a joy to watch though. She could very much be Haruhi Suzumiya&rsquo;s long lost sister. I bet if they ever meet they&rsquo;ll have a blast with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art were actually pretty good, as expected of Madhouse. Everything was drawn and designed well, from the meticulous, colorful backgrounds to the characters. The only problem I have is that the characters faces were almost too similar &ndash; the only thing that kept them distinct from each other (appearance &ndash; wise) were their hair color. Speaking of hair color, I noticed that only the main characters had different hair colors. The main characters had pink, blue, orange, etc. colored hair, while the background characters (extras) only had black or brown hair. Because of that the main characters really popped up when in a scene with many people. The character&rsquo;s eyes were very well drawn too. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m actually not familiar with most of the cast, but I do know Mai Nakahara. I loved her as Midori in Midori days &ndash; I really thought she made Midori 2-3 times cuter. She sounded a lot different as Nagisa though, which is why I didn&rsquo;t recognize her at first. I also know Shizuma&rsquo;s VA, Hitomi Nabatame, but sadly Shizuma didn&rsquo;t have a lot of lines for me to notice her either. Most of the scenes with Shizuma has her staring off into space or crying, etc.\\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic&rsquo;s music was very interesting. I love the very poppy and catchy themes of the show. It was a good contrast from the dramatic and moody BGM heard throughout the series. The BGM was classically-influenced, consisting of piano tracks, which fit the sophisticated atmosphere of Astraea hill. I also like the Ai Shimizu and Mai Nakahara&rsquo;s contribution to the soundtrack. They were a joy to watch and they brought something different to the table. I rarely see live action videos as ending/opening theme sequences. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the anime is a lot like Maria-sama ga miteru. The two series have a lot of elements in common, such as the All girls&rsquo; catholic school, the French undertones and of course the girl-girl love. There was even a hint of a soeur system during the series. I have to say I still like Marimite more, it is my favorite series, but Strawberry Panic! wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It did get over dramatic sometimes, making me want to take a nap almost every time I watch it, but I still think it&rsquo;s worth watching.",

            "content": "Kinda slow, but overall a very touching story.\r\nThe plot was substantial enough to keep it interesting and on your toes, it was difficult to find a location to stop watching for the day since each episode kinda left it open to the next one, but that was okay. theres more than just one plot line going on at once too, with multiple characters acting out different situations at the same time.\r\nThe art was good, not KyoAni standards but it was better than some others. the colors were duller and details were not as prevalent (at least in the sub i watched). however, it didn't takeaway from the story and development, if anything the lack of sharp colors added some depth to the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe character and plot development was pretty good as well. the plot was a little slow to develop, and a few things were easy to point out. but then again i was surprised at the way a few things turned out and just at how everything was played. as for the characters, theres a very good variety of them, each holding some form of an archtype, but not blatantly so. the differences were subtle, and not cookie-cutter. unlike the plot development, the character development was a lot faster; you can tell what kind of person the characters were usually within the first few episodes after they were introduced. it didn't delve into the back story often, mostly concentrating on the present and the situations occurring now. so the development as a whole was a little lacking, but the delivery was well enough to make it enjoyable and easy to understand.\\n\\n\r\nthe music was repetitive. though the opening and ending changed halfway into it, the music within the series was static, much like Madlax. (if you have ever seen it. if not, then its basically one lyric song played about 5-6 times through the series.) the regular BMG was nothing new either. but the impression wasn't a bad one, and it didn't take away from the series at all.\\n\\n\r\noverall, i'd give the show a solid 8/10. it didn't have the real attention grabbing ability of a true masterpiece, and i felt that a few characters were neglected too much. but other than that it was well worth watching!",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic Review\r\nOr girls maccin' on girls maccin' on girls\r\nLet me start by saying this: &ldquo;If you are a fan of series about girls maccin' on girls because there are girls maccin' on girls in them, you will almost undoubtedly love Strawberry Panic.&rdquo; However, if the presence of girls making doe eyes at each other and blushing constantly does not sound like the primary component of a good series, or the only necessary ones, then you might want to think twice about viewing this particular shoujo ai series. Strawberry Panic does have its share of positive traits, albeit a very small share, but it's maindraw is simply that it features pretty anime girls making googly eyes&mdash;and other significantly less tame things&mdash;at each other for 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic is full of beautiful stills in smooth, pastel colors. The backdrops are wonderfully rendered  and the character art is equally impressive. The trouble begins when those characters begin to move and interact with each other. As a series of loosely animated still images Strawberry Panic fares pretty well, and it usually manages to stick to its guns. However, the series does make a number of ill-advised decisions to break from its formula, when it should have simply polished up what it did have, instead of allowing some of the most important aspects of the series to atrophy in a disappointing display of what happens when good animators&mdash;or at the very least good artists&mdash;decide to get lazy. In a show so focused around drama and interaction between characters, the lack of expressive facial animations and the extensive shortcuts taken with reactions is mysterious, and, frankly, inexcusable. The tennis match late in the series also was a foolish animation decision, along with being a ridiculous and nearly worthless event on all sides, likely costing  significant amount of money and not delivering even a remotely positive effect. In fact, it stands as one of the worst animated sports sequences I have seen in my entire time watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso questionable is Strawberry Panic's reliance on an interesting all-or-nothing sort of fanservice, which features very few low angle shots or panty shots in general, instead inundating the viewer with essentially still images of two girls&mdash;usually in advanced stages of undress&mdash;entwined, accompanied by either slow camera zooms and pans or the constant gasping and cooing of the two girls anime fans are likely to know only too well. A lot of people are into that sort of thing, but it serves no purpose in the series. It does not enhance the romantic elements in any way, and because the fact that the entire school is comprised mostly of lesbians is taken for granted, it has no bearing on themes of sexuality it might otherwise have. If you're into that sort of thing:great, but if that does nothing or even little for you then you aren't very likely to enjoy most of the Strawberry Panic experience, as the entire series hinges on these exchanges to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as audio is concerned, Strawberry Panic is an unimpressive, but ultimately positive, experience. Though the classical score speaks nothing of any ingenuity of any sort, it does nothing to take away from the series and is tolerable at establishing the mood. During the googly-eyed make-out sequences, though, the absence of much noise aside from the dull soundtrack is supremely noticeable, especially when they don't even bother to throw in some sighs and gasps. Variety would have served the soundtrack very well as well, as the same tracks are repeated time and time again. This is fairly common in anime, but it is more noticeable in Strawberry Panic because of the frequency of periods where the music is the only noise.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is similarly vanilla. Most of the cast performs passably, but there aren't any real standouts, and the overall product is mediocre, at best, when it comes to the voice-acting. It isn't likely to stand out as especially bad, but neither will it remain in your mind as a paragon of any kind. I will say, though, that the actors perform admirably in many of the spots towards the end of the show, somehow lessening the idiotic melodrama of the latter events of the series. Much of the mediocrity of the voice-acting is also likely, in part, due to poor writing, which is most certainly present in full force.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the plot, which begins normally and pleasantly enough, but which quickly transforms into a monster of a melodramatic mess. Splitting across multiple storylines like a soap opera on crack&mdash;with delightfully fewer pregnancies and deaths&mdash;Strawberry Panic tries to cram as much drama into as few episodes as possible at every turn, only to suddenly retreat back into a feel good slice of life vibe that carries it to the next dramatic event. These events are sometimes tame events blown horribly out of proportion and sometimes massively ridiculous affairs that actually come off as humorous. By the end of the series it feels as if they were simply proving to the world that they weren't done throwing drama into this sucker. I am still amazed how a series with such a languid pace overall can feel so rushed at the end. Final episodes in anime tend to be  jam-packed, but the entirety of the last six or seven episodes is like a triathlon of bullshit. I kept waiting for it to pull back into safe territory, but Strawberry Panic was content to plunge headfirst into mediocrity and keep digging for the very bottom. It didn't quite reach, but it was one hell of an effort.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Strawberry Panic is a series targeted at a very specific audience, to the detriment of any who watch who does not count themselves as a strong proponent of moe, not as a device but simply for the sake of itself. The series was built around moe, all aspects pointing centrally to accentuate it. The problem is, unlike some moe series which have other things to offer those less interested, Strawberry Panic has very little beyond the moe. The character design and art are good enough, so if moe is something you're really into, Strawberry Panic might very well be a good pick. All others, though, should stay away, as this series was not designed with the general viewer in mind.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10\\n",

            "content": "I watched this when I was 15 and had a completely wrong impression of how to go about a relationship with a girl. Now I find it to be one of the worst starters for girls who are lesbian or bisexual, it teaches you that manipulation and perversion is okay to push onto another, and that consent doesn't matter. At 15 I thought it was magical and incredible, but at 23, just seeing the first few episodes I already feel sickened by the portrayal of lesbians as creepy and abusive, and I think of all the young girls (like I was) watching this and thinkingthis is how lesbian relationships must work, that it's okay to kiss another girl without her consent, or use any excuse to touch her (measure her body parts), humiliate her, and just full on objectify and assault her, and all the while the excuse for these abuses is that the subject is 'too cute', and finding another cute and child-like is enough of an excuse to treat her like an object.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to this signs of embarrassment in another girl is cute and a green flag for more humiliation with sexual undertones. Not only this but any sign of a character being uncomfortable, or non consenting is 'kawaii-fied' and another green flag for disturbing behaviour. It lead me as a teen to the impression that this abusive and fetishizing behaviour is acceptable between girls. \\n\\n\r\nYes as a 15 year old I loved it, all of this I thought was Romantic, and I yearned for the kind of unequal relationship that Nagisa and Shizuma had, but looking back I can see how badly it affected me as a young and confused bisexual female, and I wish I had never watched it and given into the ideas that were put across in this anime. So I refuse to notice anything that might be good in this because it's impact is so destructive to a young girl's idea of a healthy lesbian relationships.",

            "content": "Warning:\r\n\"Strawberry Panic!\" is a Yuri anime. It follows the story of lesbian\r\ncouples and if you have an aversion to homosexuality, or things of\r\nthat nature, I would not recommend this anime to you.\r\nAnime: Strawberry Panic!\r\nFormat: DVD Video, Region Code 2  (Middle East,Iceland,Western Europe,Central Europe,Egypt,French overseas territories,Greenland,Japan,Lesotho,South Africa, and Swaziland only) Subtitles: None, Audio Track: Japanese: Dolby Digital\r\nStereo\r\nCreator: Sakurako KIMINO\r\nPublisher: Madhouse Studios/IMAGIN (Japan)\r\nRelease Date: 2006 (Japan)\r\nRating: TV-14-SD (May be inappropriate for childern under 14)\r\nGenre: Romance, Drama, Yuri\r\nFormat:\r\nStory:\r\nStrawberry Panic revolves around three all-girls schools: St.\r\nMiator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's\r\nGirls' School. In Miator, Nagisa Aoi is the main love interest of\r\nthree of thegirls in that school and they are Tamao Suzumi, Shizuma\\n\r\nHanazono and Chiyo Tsukidate. In Spica, Hikari Konohana is the main\\n\r\nlove interest of three of the girls in that school and they are Yaya\\n\r\nNanto, Amane Ohtori, and Tsubomi Okuwaka. In the third school, the\\n\r\ncharacters play a very small role in the anime, except for one named\\n\r\nChikaru Minamoto. The other characters there are important to the\\n\r\nstory, but not main characters.\\n\r\n        The story that &quot;Strawberry Panic&quot; weaves is like being on a\\n\r\nemotional roller-coaster. There will be times you feel happy, then\\n\r\nsad, then angry. You will almost certainly laugh and cry throughout\\n\r\nthe episodes.\\n\r\n       The Strawberry Dorms (Proper Name is Astrea Dormitory) is where the\\n\r\ncharacters interact the most. The dormitorys are on the campus of a\\n\r\nvery large catholic church near a lake, which are all located on\\n\r\nAstrea Hill.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n       The animation is amazing, crisp, and clean in my opinion. One of the\\n\r\nthings I have always loved about anime, is the characters eyes. The\\n\r\neyes are used to convey such emotion that you might not normally see\\n\r\nin an animation. When there are close ups, it is even better.\\n\r\n       It is refreshing to see an anime using the older style of animation.\\n\r\nNot making it flashy with bright colors, and CG animation. The colors\\n\r\nand the animation are some what dulled compared to what we are\\n\r\naccustomed to with newer anime. I'm not at all pointing this out as a\\n\r\nflaw in the anime, or saying it is a bad thing at all. It is really\\n\r\nwell done in Strawberry Panic, and it gives almost a feeling of\\n\r\nnostalgia for old school anime. I have been watching anime all of my\\n\r\nlife, and the art in this specific one brought back memories of animes\\n\r\nlike Vampire Hunter D, Iria - Zeiram The Animation, The Fantastic\\n\r\nAdventures of Unico, Sailor Moon, and Speed Racer. All of these animes\\n\r\nare less flashy, don't use bright colors, and don't use CG Animation\\n\r\nbut are still just amazing, great animes, and watching them makes me\\n\r\nfeel great too.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Opening Theme Songs are\\n\r\n#1: &quot;Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete&quot; by Aki Misato (EP's 1-13)\\n\r\n#2: &quot;Kuchibiru Daydream&quot; by Aki Misato (EP's 14-26)\\n\r\nboth opening songs really really good\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending Theme Songs are\\n\r\n#1: &quot;Himitsu Dolls&quot; by Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu (EP's 1-13)\\n\r\n#2: &quot;Ichigo Tsumi Monogatari&quot;  by Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu (EP's 14-25)\\n\r\n#3: &quot;Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete&quot; by Aki Misato (EP 26)\\n\r\nnow #1 and #3 are really good songs but #2 is not all that good, the\\n\r\nSoundscore is done by Composer Yoshihisa Hirano, (Hirano Yoshihisa ,\\n\r\nborn December 7. 1971 in Wakayama Prefecture) he studied composing at\\n\r\nJuilliard School in 1992, and later at Eastman School of Music, he has\\n\r\ncomposed music for concert,dance,film,radio and anime soundtracks. The\\n\r\nsound score for Strawberry Panic is mostly classical style and it is\\n\r\nreally good. Much like the anime itself, the sound score can be\\n\r\nhappy,lively, sad, mysterious, haunting, and overall is just very\\n\r\nbeautiful and really good music.\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\r\nThe Etoile System is a system in place to govern the Internal Politics\\n\r\nand operations of all three school , Etoile is a French word meaning\\n\r\nStar. The Etoile is a figurehead of Astrea Hill and the Etoile has\\n\r\nspecific duties like greeting new students to Astrea Hill,\\n\r\nparticipating in important school events, and acting as a mediator\\n\r\nbetween disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, and\\n\r\nother duties. They have a private greenhouse to grow flowers for using\\n\r\nin school events. The Etoile is a very important and respected person.\\n\r\nEtoile system is a big part of the story. There is a lot more to the\\n\r\nEtoile System but you will find this out when you watch the anime, I\\n\r\ndid not want to give away any more then I had to because this\\n\r\nsomething you have to find out on your own.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great story and well done characters.\\n\r\n-Amazing animation and great art work.\\n\r\n-Really good sound score and great songs.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nNone\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nNow I might go on too much about this so please bear with me. I have\\n\r\nread  a few forum's and reviews that suggest that Strawberry Panic is\\n\r\na ripoff of an anime called Maria-sama ga Miteru. This is something I\\n\r\ncompletely disagree with. I have watched all of Strawberry Panic and\\n\r\nMaria-sama ga Miteru they are nothing alike.\\n\r\n       Now as I said to start, if you are uncomfortable with homosexuality,\\n\r\nthis might not be the anime for you. However it was an amazing anime,\\n\r\nbasically in my eyes about romance, no matter who it occurs between.\\n\r\nIts about the ups and downs of love, and I thought it was great.\\n",

            "content": "I\\'m fair, and yet I have to give Strawberry Panic an overall 8, not only because it\\'s shojo ai and we get to see the goddess character almost get it on with the cute and often clueless main character, but it\\'s also because the painful feelings that the characters have for each other.\r\nStrawberry Panic is a shojo-ai show thorough and thorough. While all the elements in this show would suggest a old-time shojo show - classical music, beautiful senpai with classic shojo drawings of big hair and an elegant aura, a (not so secret) garden, Catholic school complete with a cathedral, a fountain and classrooms,sports that Japanese girls admire, and other classic shojo things, it\\'s clearly a show aimed at male Otakus because of all the yuri scenes going on, with some fanservice for males.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s kind of odd because in the early days of shojo anime, shows with only women or almost only women and very few men in there would never be aimed at males. Boys/young men/men had always watched shows with men fighting in mechas, with swords, on a sports field, fighting and beating each other bloody, and so on. But with the obsessiveness of the Otaku, whom are often terrible when dealing with women - wanting to be with women but severely uncomfortable in women\\'s presence, shows that discover what women do around each other and alone (real and imaginary) are created. \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, conflicts of love go on in this show, as various characters fall in love with different women (heehee), some of their love interests respond in kind, others fail to recipicate. A lot of conflicts and a dark past is revealed when love is being sparked. We follow Nagisa, our protagonist\\'s steps as she slowly discovers this campus, herself, her relationships with her roommate, who\\'s deep in love with her, her friends and surroundings, and her real love - the seemingly distant and playful Shizuma - the top of the top of the 3 campuses. Other characters also get developed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s hard to definite this as a shojo show or not. I call it the &quot;shori&quot; show - shonen fan service with Yuri elements in it. I simply cannot classify it as a shojo show because too many lesbian love in there, I mean, sometimes there are almost no normal female relationships in this show. \\n\\n\r\nLove the design of the characters, they\\'re all beautiful,  or cute, and all distinctive enough. The music is OK for me. Mostly classical and light music with nothing standing out. The characters are nicely fleshed out, with some shojo and imaginary lesbian stereotypes - this is made for shy male otakus after all. The plots are shojoesque with infighting and competition over the top title of the 3 campuses but it isn\\'t terribly boring. Maybe it\\'s because I love seeing shojo-ai and I appreciate the seiyuu for their work in this show.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for all who love shojo-ai/yuri. This is a shining example of yuri done right.",

            "content": "(updated 9/20/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, as I'm going to deal in the broader strokes. MINOR SPOILERS may appear, though I do try to keep those to an absolute minimum. Strawberry Panic is loved by some, and hated by others, because it's really basically just an anime soap opera. It is over the top, often cheesy, and if you don't think too much, really, really fun. This was my first full blown yuri anime, and it's not nostalgia colored, this review. As always, the crew will not earn aspot on the RTLR wall for rose colored glasses either. I've seen so many more, so much more beautifully done (Aoi Hana comes to mind) but I still cannot back off the fact I had fun watching this anime!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe setup with Nagisa is a bit cliche if you ask me, though SP turns it up with Shizuma's sudden, intense interest in her. This anime lets you know right up front what it going to be going down. I found the story of cat fights, senpai worship, and unrequited love to start out mundane, but yet well enough done to hold my interest. There are several relationships, and hints of relationships that are interesting enough to watch and learn about. Love triangles, loving someone who loves someone else, and even the evil girls trying to use rape at worst to sexual assault at best to sway someone's heart is enough action to keep the mind from wandering. There is also more than one 'couple' that matter in the show, a trend most anime avoids. We have at least 3 pairings and a possibly of a few more by the end that all get fair amounts of screen time. And that ending! I'm American, and I prefer stories to go out on a bang, and boy does this one ever! No muted 'maybe' endings here! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI love the way the series is drawn. I love Shizuma's hair, I love the expressive eyes, I love the gothic lolita uniforms, and even the other two schools uniforms. The lines tend more to 'clean' than detailed, but the whole package comes together very nicely and in a very fitting way. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nMy only sound gripe: those birds! Often when opening a scene they show the outside of the building, with birds chirping as they are known to do. For some reason those chirps are 3 times louder than the dialog or even music in the show! I almost developed a Hitchcockian fear of birds! Otherwise though, the sound was really good. Shizuma's voice actress nailed it, as did Nagisa's. The ending song is good, but weird in being live action. The second ending song is also live action but a bit out of place. Otherwise, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where the drama comes in and the shine begins. We have a girl who begins basically as a total slut, and as the series progresses, we learn that she is in fact in great pain and acting out in a way we might find inappropriate but makes sense in the overall scheme of things. The only problem with her arc is that the writers didn't seem to think it through and tossed in a plot twist out of the blue just to facilitate the situation that leads to the trauma. There is also a mannish girl who is called a 'prince' of her school who falls for a beautiful girly girl, giving us a 'traditional' lesbian relationship. The evil girls have a twisted, manipulative lesbian relationship that is just utterly incomprehensible at times. The cast is quite large, with the 'club always looking for what club to be' and the younger children on the way up in the school, along with the stern Student Council president, and her contemporaries from the other two schools. There's a lot of people to keep up with, but it becomes fairly easy quickly, as you develop a favorite couple, and gasp and gawk as they turn the drama to 11. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really liked this because I did watch things like Days of Our Lives with my mom as a kid. I don't mind the overblown drama. If you can't see past that, then you should for sure take a pass on this anime. I loved seeing what event was on the verge of destroying the precious relationships, and cheering when they made it through against all odds. Is it cheap, cheesy, corny, silly, and over the top? Yes to all those things. Does that mean it isn't fun? Not in the least, long as you go in with your eyes open. It's high school lesbian drama, not Shakespeare! \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, if you want to just veg out and check out an anime that doesn't require much thought and don't mind the titillating nature of the show, this is one to watch. This is firmly yuri, with implied (and a few scenes of literally being between the sheets!) sexual scenes in places, and it makes no bones about who's with who as a couple. It's a ton of fun if you turn your brain off and just let the soap bubble. Strawberry Panic rates one pic of Shizuma and Nagisa intently staring in each others' eyes as well as one of Amane and Hikari in the same pose on the wide RTLR wall. Feel bad for Tamoe-chan though. This is one high school worth visiting!",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, but given this is my favorite anime I figured I'd give it a shot. I started watching this anime because I wanted a yurified yurifest with some yuri on top, which, to my great satisfaction, i got. However what I wasn't expecting is a touching(and at times heartbreaking) love story that most people who watch this anime seem to over-look. Basically, you have three girl schools, which means three harems, two of which have their own love story, and one of which is for hilarity, comic relief, and general epic-ness. During the more Slice-of-lifey parts of the series, the charactersof the three schools hang out and interact together, but as far as love goes, most romance stays inside it's own school harem.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. This is a very character driven story, and as such there are very few outside influences that actually drive the story forward themselves. Of course, this is a love story, so that hardly comes as a surprise. Many of the events come across as cliche' and sometimes down right cheesy. While there are many moments that are truly touching(I've been brought to tears on multiple occasions), there are others that just make you want to gag. Luckily, these points aren't nearly common enough to totally ruin the enjoyment of the series as a whole, and the rest of this series make that barf worth swallowing.(This being a character driven story, i'll cover that in the \"characters\" portion)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10. This isn't to say the art itself was poor, there are some truly spectacular scenes on Astraea. However, for the majority of a 26 episode series to take place in the same locations, the same forest, the same dormitories, the same everything, is just tedious. The lush hill-top Citadel and mansions, surrounded by forest and lake, are beautiful for the first half or so of the anime, but when you start noticing these backgrounds becoming used and reused through-out the series, they start to become old and tired. There are certain points every episode or two when new locations will be introduced and provide a refreshing change, but for the most part, you better get used to those trees and hallways.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Hands down, as far as openings go, this anime has two of the best I've ever heard. Both of them are amazing both in terms of music and accompanying animation, and serves the mood of this anime... dare I use the word... perfectly. Unfortunately, the music played during the anime itself lets this category down slightly. As if this wasn't a big enough problem, the \"orchestra-ish\" music, while in all honesty is somewhat enjoyable on it's own, only serves to add to the \"cheesy soap-opera\" feel this series has at times, especially when played during the already nearly unbearable corny moments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10. This is where Strawberry Panic truly shines. One of the greatest casts I've seen in a yuri, and in anime in general. With three schools, each with their own unique \"onee-sama\" character, love interest, \"love interest's best friend\", loli, and a fair amount of other, equally awesome cast members, there is no shortage of characters to fall in love with. By the end of the series, you would have to be heart-less to not feel a sense of attachment to the majority of them. Most anime with large casts become annoying and tedious to follow, but the characters in Strawberry Panic are all so unique and interesting, that the large-cast-harem theme was handled, dare i say it again, perfectly. When this series ended, I was almost as sad about missing the characters themselves as I was that the anime was over. The only gripe I can come up with is that certain characters, such as Chiyo(resident loli of Miator) fall into generic anime arch-typesy, though this is hardly noticeable in the diverse cast SP offers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. What can I say? Anime that I enjoyed as much as this one are few and far between. I laughed , I cried, I am head-over-heels in love with 90% of the characters. There is one thing I would like to address that didn't belong anywhere else in my review... the fan-service. I think one of the biggest things that make me love this series so much is not the presence of fan-service, but the type of fanservice that it has. It has a fair amount of ecchi, bath scenes, shower scenes, \"waking-up-naked-together-after-a-night-of-sweet-passionate-love\" scenes and other \"convenient censoring\" moments. What this series doesn't contain, however, is just as important. You will not find panty-shot upskirts, you will not find boobs that seem to defy the laws of physics and anatomy, and you will not find \"Oops I tripped and my face is in your cleavage\", or anything to that effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. On my list, I gave it a 10 as well as a comfy spot on my favorites list, but I want this review to be as un-biased as possible, and i cannot ignore it's flaws. I leave you with this: If you want a realistic, true to life romance-drama that addresses the difficulties of life, angst and love, search else where. Search FAR FAR AWAY, because you're not even in the ballpark, kid. If you want a sweet, touching, heart-warming love story about an all-girls school, my friend, you've come to the right place.",

            "content": "Strawberry panic seemed to be a popular 'yuri-shipper' anime so i decided to give it a try..sadly i was a bit dissapointed.[i know there a few of my MaL friends who loved it ..so sorry and hear me out] I'll start with the story. \r\n Story left much to be desired. The pace of it for was felt so slow. im not sure if i was the constant --lets have a tea party-- or -- make some cookies-- fillers but for me, it felt as if the episode wouldnt end. [not good if im constantly looking at the timer to see if and ep isalmost done yet] Not to \\n\r\nsay there arnt shipper-arks that i wasnt curious about their ending but where\\n\r\ni was taken in the story was either typical or bland. Somthing that also bothered me was the lack of male characters...ANYWHERE!! no male teachers, vistors...brothers...umm..fathers! O.o someone has to have dad iright?! i understand this is a girls school and yuri..but come on! the setting of the story also bothered me they seemed to never leave their school area ..either to shop or do typical high school stuff [in im guessing japan] \\n\r\nwhen they did leave it was for romantic tryst in the country or priviate beach. the only thing these girls did for fun were tea parties,school politics,\\n\r\nand make up diff clubs everyday[where id be xD if i was stuck there] just not realistic..even for anime. \\n\r\nArt was pleasent to the eye. i did like their character design; Main\\n\r\ncharacter shizuma's eyes were very pretty. The design of the outfit design was great w/ the 3 schools having diff dress. i liked the layout of the school\\n\r\nand strawberry dorms w/ it heavy cathloic school feel. some charc seem to \\n\r\nhave huge craniums and somes the their legs look like flesh colored sticks,but\\n\r\nstill not many complaints.\\n\r\nMusic meh..not a strong point it seems not even for people \\n\r\nwho enjoy this series intro and endings were cutsy ,but not really catchy\\n\r\nor anything memorable..neither was backround music..so meh\\n\r\nCharacters i found to be a bit sterotypical either for their \\n\r\ncharacter type or for women in general. Good ex: is Amane: silent,but\\n\r\nkind prince type [she even rides a white horse..star bride..really *face palm*] and the shy sweet princess type:Hikari. is it suprising that she fell for Amane..nope!  even if she has perfectly nice,funny, smexy roomate \\n\r\nright next to who'madly in love with her Do they do anything unexpected with this story..they tried xP u wana see a good girl whos \\n\r\na prince w/ girl princess story watch Rev. Girl Utena..unless u love predictable story. The fact the complex feeling of love and desire wre either limited to one person or solved w/ tea parties or solved w/ tears[via end w/ hikari and her secrect admier] of hopful --i know you love me,but i wana be just friends\\n\r\nsooo can u help me put on this dress for the ultimate date w/ girl i choose over you..thanx ..friend!-- that irked me be/c no one would do that. it also \\n\r\nkinda botherd me that EVERYONE was girlxgirl..there was a mention of male fiance at one point but that was it. but i guess if i was stuck in strawberry dorms for 3-4years id sneak into my roomates bed too xD \\n\r\n  So overall This anime could have been much better but hasnt turned \\n\r\nme off of yuri ill just research better on the story next time. Wasnt all bad \\n\r\neven if it took forever for a kiss to happen [and it did!] It had it cute moments\\n\r\nand sexy-steamy moments [some still a let down] but still i cant say it was enjoyable to watch. more frustrating than anythign else. So if you like pridictable story, stereotypical main characters, constant tea parties spiced\\n\r\nw/ few steamy yuri-shipper scenes then this is one anime u shouldnt miss..otherwise wait for another more intracate yuri to come out. \\n\r\nwhich is what i should have did x3\\n\r\n--feel free comment to me/give feedback if you have some gripes/compliments--",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is a sort of difficult review to write. I remember initially watching the show as it first came out. I remember being well into the show's story and enjoying it enough to have a sort of urge to continue watching it and I was done before I knew it. \r\nStory:\r\nProbably the strongest aspect of the show is the story as it centers around an all girls school centered on a hierarchy similar to modern day democracy. It follows a girl who just transferred there and quickly draws the attention of the Etoile (similar to, say President of the Body) and from there itfollows her and she becomes custom to the life in this school. An interesting choice the Anime makes is that there are no males present, or even mentioned specifically in the entire series. The show explores same-sex relations very liberally and doesn't glorify it like most anime centered  on the topic.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the character designs and I thought the art designs of each of the scenes were beautifully done, but the animation is classic fare. The Music was above average and complimented the story but wasn't especially catching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how the plot doesn't really start unfolding towards the end, it's a very character driven show. Development is key and that's what Strawberry Panic is best at. You often see the characters change and strive for what they want. The strongest aspects is how the important characters are explored through their past so we, the viewers can have some introspect on what they've experienced and how they've grown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf I could fault Strawberry Panic for anything, it'd be for the fact that it can be quite vanilla and predictable at times. It's strongest aspect, however, is how it's unique from other anime in the genre, and is most cases it's parts are all above average. The story and characters all come to together in the end and it has a very satisfying conclusion. If you're a fan of shoujo-ai or just romance in general this is definitely worth looking into.",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is one of the first yuri shows that I've seen that managed to hook me through the full 26 episodes. While the anime isn't something that I'd consider to be a masterpiece, it was enjoyable. \r\nThe MAL synopsis gives you a good idea of what the anime is about, so I'd recommend reading it.\r\nSTORY: 8. Overall, the story is pretty realistic in the sense that there aren't crazy plot twists or random events that shift the story of the anime. The pace of the anime is very drawn out for 26 episodes. I felt that the pace wasn't too slow, though others mightdisagree. Aoi Nagisa transfers to a new school, and drama stirs up over time around the characters because, girls liking girls. However, there wasn't any parts of the anime that really caught my attention, but the story is very solid and there wasn't any fillers in any of the 26 episodes, which is a huge plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8. For an anime that is in 2006, the art wasn't bad at all. Can't really comment too much because we're talking about an anime released 9 years back from the time this is written.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9. The music was on point. Can't really complain about that. I liked how they used a lot of instrumentals and piano, which matches each and every scene's mood. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8. There wasn't any character that stood out to me. Lots of nice girls here and there, and some standard personalities that you could find in many animes. On the flip side, there wasn't any character that I could say that I really hated, so I'd say an 8 is good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8. Somehow I managed to watch bursts of episodes. There wasn't fillers, which would be something that a 24-26 episode anime could have, so I'm happy about that. The characters were kawaii overall, and with the yuri aspect, it wasn't overdone.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8. If you are watching this for the yuri, just know that it isn't huge on girl on girl action compared to ecchi/hentai anime. If you are put off from this anime because it was released in 2006, I would reconsider... it's a pretty good watch. The romance was there, and so was the drama. Just don't expect a perfect anime out of this one.",

            "content": "Its been a while since I've written a review on this site so bear with me just a little bit..\r\nStrawberry Panic is a yuri anime~basically its a girl to girl love type story with a hint of lesbianism mixed together. Not that i have any complaints against that, since its my first time watching a yuri anime i was like WTF at first, but the anime was actually better than i thought it would turn out to be. Now on with the reviews:\r\nStory: The story was honestly not the best factor of the series, but it is an interesting one. It revolves around the mainprotagonist Nagisa Aoi, her transfer into Astraea Hill Girl's Academy, and the relationship she forges with her schoolmates inside the academy. There are 3 schools total: the Spica Academy, Le Rim, and finally Miator(the school Nagisa is in). Over the course of her time inside the school, Nagisa encounters many fellow students who she eventually develops good relationships with along with her fellow dorm roommate and friend Tamao. Because the story is not very solid, and doesn't really have a centralized plot it tends to waver and confuse the audience which explains why i won't give it higher than a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As expected of Madhouse, the art was actually very well-designed and developed. Although it wasn't the greatest artwork ever, its still really good for a yuri anime. The background sceneries, the characters, the Strawberry dorms, and the school itself were drawn well and had good use of coloring to top it off. For some reason the art reminds me of some classic paintings from the past with vibrant and rich textures to blend in altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music i thought was pretty decent. I only liked the OP theme from episodes 1-13 and it was very catchy, i even have it on my Ipod. The ending themes were not very good and were just a turnoff for me. Although \\n\r\nsome of the piano music played by Nagisa and Shizuma were really good. Nothing too much to say here..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I do love the characters in this anime quite a bit, however i was somewhat disappointed by the fact that they didn't quite explain each of the characters in detail, so it was kinda vague in that sense. The only characters that had stories to them were Nagisa (our heroine) and Shizuma Hanazono. Shizuma I thought had the most emotional story out of all the characters, and i thought she was the most developed character in the series.. when you watch episodes 17-19 the real reason behind her emotional facade shows in detail and its really quite compelling. As for the other characters, like Tamao, Rokujou, etc..the characters weren't explained well and it left things hanging at times. Nevertheless, the characters expressed various emotions, feelings for each other, and might i add very kawaii in a good sense. Here you will see where the yuri fits in:\\n\\n\r\nNagisa and Shizuma \\n\\n\r\nAmano and Hikari (Great couple I might add!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed the series it was definitely a good series to watch. At first i was a bit skeptical about watching this but after reading the light novel, I just felt that i had to watch the anime and it didnt disappoint. I've enjoyed it maybe you might too. I'm actually not a big fan of yuri, but there wasn't that many sex scenes in the series which was actually good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: an 8/10 i give it. Strawberry Panic isn't for everyone..you will either like it or not like it that's all i can say, but my recommendation is read the light novel first to get an idea wut the story is like, then watch the anime or vice versa. But for me i've enjoyed it to the point where i might watch it again in a future date.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What if the characters of Maria Sama just decided to forego all that sexual tension and just got it on with one another. Well, you'd have this. Maria Sama on crack, or maybe a healthy dose of GHB.\r\nLesbian schoolgirl love story.\r\nThe story introduces everygirl, Nagisa, who gets sent to a private all girls' boarding school where she meets the mysterious, aloof (I hate that word, but it's fitting), and oft-worshipped silver-haired maiden Shizuma. Shizuma immediately wants to jump Nagisa's bones, but for no real good reason. Maybe becuse she's an Etoile, the elected focus of worship in the school. \r\nThe rest of the show focuseson Shizuma and Nagisa's budding relationship and I'm left scratching my head AS TO WHY, since the reason is delayed in presentation. Like, 14-15 episodes in.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other girls who do the nasty, and we're treated to their backstories and obvious denoument of their infatuation--but for some reason I don't seem to remember them all that well and they don't seem that important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo, um, back to Shizuma and Nagisa. Once Nagisa realizes that a creepy older woman wanting to sleep with her is alright, we're treated to why Shizuma is like the way she is. Guess what, there's a TRAGIC BACKSTORY TOLD IN FLASHBACKS, albeit this is when the show arguably becomes somewhat tasteful and takes itself seriously and tries to treat the characters with some actual depth, especially at the point where grief ridden Shizuma forces herself on Nagisa. This moment, shockingly, is very realistic and sad (and likely unintentionally so). That and the fact that unloading dark, unresolved emotional baggage on someone does not make them love you more, like most other anime seems to imply. \\n\\n\r\nThese few episodes really shone above and beyond the rest of the anime and showed an alarming insight that quickly was buried and abandoned for more filler. The problem is for every convincing chrarcter and plot development, we have a bunch of hormone-ridden fluff to distract us and kill the pacing. Add that with the inexplicable introduction of a Tamao, Nagisa's roommate, was clearly meant to create tension between Nagisa and Shizuma as she has no other role and the show falls apart again.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the entire series is totally redeemed by the incredibly absurd and entertaining ending which is the most bizarre parody of the Graduate wedding scene since Grampa Simpson ran off with Marge's mother. It almost makes me think different people wrote different arcs, and they all hated each other and finally settled on the most pointless resolution to their conflict.",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is like any other generic yuri anime you've watched. Girl goes to an all-girl school, meets one special person, discovers she's in love with her, etc. It sort of sounds like fanfiction that a 12-year-old could come up with, right? Not to mention the main character is a total Mary Sue. Everyone is in love with Nagisa, and the only times she messes up is when her seme Shizuma comes to rescue her. Character development is absolutely terrible. I mean, EVERY SINGLE GIRL in that school is a lesbian? That seems highly unrealistic to me... And of course, the short, shy girls areukes where the tall, robust girls are semes. And the girls of focus in this anime (Nagisa and Hikari, respectively) both of their roommates are in love with them, and they're in love with generic semes. It seems like the stories of the characters are copying off of each other, even though they're in the same anime... It just all seems so unoriginal, all the girls in the schools seem the same! We have the ~*kawaii*~ uke and main character that everyone loves: Nagisa, the silent semes that also everyone loves: Shizuma and Amane, the one-sided loving best friends: Tamao and Yaya, the chibi quiet girls: Hikari and Chiyo, the antagonists: Momomi and Kaname, and the tsundere: Tsubomi. It's all so unoriginal, but I guess if that's what you were looking for, then you'll enjoy this anime very well.",

            "content": "If you are in anyway a fan of yuri anime, then Strawberry Panic is a bit of a rite of passage for entry into the genre.  It probably garners the highest amount of fanaticism and emotionalism from its supporters and detractors.  Though I wouldn\u2019t call it a love or hate it kind of show as you might expect from that.  I think of myself as a reasonably objective person and found that my opinion of it split almost right down the middle between absolute love and complete contempt.\r\nStrawberry Panic's story centers on a new student to a prestigious all girls\u2019 school, NagisaAoi.  The school is divided into three separate campuses which operate separately, have different uniforms, but are functionally really the same institution.  Oh, and basically the entire student body are lesbians... hey this is yuri after all!  There isn\u2019t any amazing drama or nefarious villains as the story almost totally revolves around relationship angst.  The story walks the line on being a light hearted romantic comedy to having some pretty deep drama but for the most part it is a lot of fun.  I would imagine most people are going to enjoy it a lot, until you get to the last five to six episodes.  Here is where there is likely to be disagreement amongst viewers as pairings finalize and plot twists emerge.  This is where my enjoyment also suffered, because I intensely disliked almost every final pairing and the ending to the final story arc itself left me quite angry and disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have some magnificent highs but also some annoying lows.  As far as Nagisa goes, whom just about every important plotline flows through, she is a sweet and likable character.  Immediately people are going to gravitate to her much as characters do in the story and find something to like about her.  However as the story unfolds, I found her becoming increasingly unlikable and idiotic.  The decisions she makes, her inability to see the obvious right in front of her face, and her ditzy nature (while extremely endearing at the beginning of the series) becomes annoying and tired.  You want to feel for her angst and conflict but in the end you're just so over with her.\\n\\n\r\nShizuma, next to Nagisa, is the most important character in the story and probably the most interesting.  Though that doesn\u2019t mean she is particularly likable.  A friend once referred to her as the \"Mac-Daddy\" of the school.  She seems willing to go after any girl in the school while seemingly not really caring about them or the consequences of her actions.  Her past is tragic and explains the reasons why she is the way she is.  But she is a psychologically damaged person and hurts a lot of people along the way, though probably not intentionally.  She simply just can\u2019t help it.  While she does make a lot of progress and matures some over the story I still couldn\u2019t help but think that in the end in her heart of hearts she really hadn\u2019t changed.\\n\\n\r\nTamao is the last of the main cast.  She will be instantly likable by all though will not come across as a terribly unique character in the annals of anime history.  As the other love interest for Nagisa, this is where viewers of the show are going to start to separate themselves.  You\u2019re going to be a Tamao fan or a Shizuma one.  Depending on which character you find yourself rooting for is likely to affect the way you view the anime in the end.  I did like her, though she has a lot of Nagisa's personality traits and her ditzy nature does get annoying towards the end\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad and it pretty much starts and ends for me with Amane and Hikari.  Amane is the stereotypical character we seem to always have forced on us in anime.  The emotionless robot who happens to be admired by all despite having no personality and looking and dressing like a man.  Yes, this is YURI; I am watching it for the girls!  So what is this mannish toad-face doing in my show!  I found absolutely nothing redeeming about her and the only reason I could even think of that all these girls revered her so much was that at an all girls school she was the most likely to have a sausage in her pants.  This all being said, it seems fitting that she is linked with the second worst character in the show, Hikari.  Hikari is basically a functional retard.  She has no personality attributes besides being moe to the extreme that would make anyone care about her.  She spends all of her time in constant angst over what Amane thinks of her and ignores the people who truly care about her (though heaven only knows why they do).  Honestly I think if nobody guided her along and told her when to wake up and eat she would just stand in the corner and starve to death.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast is actually pretty good.  Yaya and Chikaru stand out above all the others.  I would liked to have seen both of those characters get better endings and felt they were ignored a bit too much.  Almost everyone would be considered likable and friendly, the kind of people you would want to be friends with.  The only exception would be Kaname and Momomi.  I really found them to be despicable characters and their actions and motivations were pretty hard for me to stomach.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is exceptional.  I really enjoyed the beautiful settings and costumes and with the exception of Amane, all of the girls were quite stunning to look at.  The voice acting and music was also very good.  A few of the character voices grated on me, but mostly because they were characters I didn\u2019t like. (Hikari, Amane)  The OP and EN songs were performed by Nagisa's and Tamao's voice actress and I thought fit the theme and feel of the show wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment of Strawberry Panic is going to greatly depend on how you felt about the final pairings.  Some people are really going to like this a lot and others are going to feel very disappointed as I was.  In addition I very much disliked how the final arc played out and that several key characters basically got the shaft in terms of their own romances.  It\u2019s a fun show for the most part, required viewing for yuri fans and probably one of the better shows of the genre out there.  That in itself is an indictment of yuri anime.\\n",

            "content": "I really should not have enjoyed this series nearly as much as I did. As a bit of a technical story snob, I usually find that well-animated and voiced series with somewhat weak storylines tend to rate quite poorly with me. I find myself dropping them, or rating them well below a seven, but this series just has that something compelling about it that makes you enjoy it thoroughly-- despite some glaring problems with the plot. If I had to sum this series up in two words, it would quite easily be: Guilty pleasure. \r\nIt is one of a very small number of series thatI can watch repeatedly and still enjoy quite a bit, despite my somewhat low 'overall' score. As you can see, I found this series ridiculously entertaining which--for me--is sometimes more important than a good technical overall score. \\n\\n\r\nPossibly the weakest part of this series was the plot. It was, at times, ridiculous, superficial, far-fetched, full of cheese and melodrama, but still oddly compelling. If it were a novel, the story would most likely be in a two-dollar bin in your local book store, yet there is somehow still enough substance buried in there to keep it afloat. Despite all I may say about the plot there are some truly touching moments buried in there -- and those are the little gems that keep you wanting more, despite yourself. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially the plot is separated into two mini-stories: The main following bumbling transfer-student Aoi Nagisa from Miator, and the secondary following Konohana Hikari, a timid choir-girl from Spica. While the majority of the plot centres around Nagisa, there is enough material from Hikari's story to keep you entertained if you find yourself uninterested by the protagonist's antics. \\n\\n\r\nWith healthy doses of fluff and comedy, hefty smearings of romance and the odd tragic moment or two, there is certainly enough going on to keep the plot from idling. It was just a slight pity that they couldn't inject just a little more substance to enable me to rate it a little higher. \\n\\n\r\nVisually this series is quite beautiful. While not on par with KyotoAni's breath-taking animation, gorgeous scenery, dynamic colours and interesting character designs, it makes for quite the pleasant viewing experience. That said-- there are times when the artwork looks a little awkward, though fortunately they are few and far between. And if you can quickly adjust to the stick-thin legs and arms that are common in this series, the character designs are quite striking, of special note are Hanazono Shizuma and Minamoto Chikaru, though with an ensemble cast of well over twelve there is bound to be at least one design to find pleasing. \\n\\n\r\nMusically, Strawberry Panic is neither ground-breaking nor particularly breath-taking, yet there is a simplicity in the classical tracks that fit with the setting and overall tone of the series. Seiyuu performances are rather exquisite, with a cast consisting of: Nabatame Hitomi, Nakahara Mai, Shimizu Ai, Noda Junko and Kuwatani Natsuko there is more than enough skill to inject feeling into sometimes two-dimensional characters. Certainly there are some emotional scenes that are simply made by the skill of these masterful seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, this series is made of an ensemble cast, but unfortunately they tend to be rather two-dimensional or stereotypical characters. That said, there is a wonderfully subtle build-up in a few of the characters that really does surprise, and you can't help but empathise with your favourites as they are put through an emotional blender. \\n\\n\r\nDespite it all I found myself strangely addicted to this series. Yes, the plot is weak, uses cliche plot progressions, makes no sense at times and is borderline ridiculous, yet I found it to be one of the most entertaining series in my collection. The chemistry between the characters, some brilliant work by the cast and some truly spectacular scenes mean that I enjoyed this series for what it was-- mindless fun. By episode twenty-six, I was more than disappointed that this series was over, and I would have to go elsewhere to find my fix of cheesy-goodness. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a deep and sophisticated plot in a similar vein, watch Maria-sama ga Miteru; if you want hours of cheesy, light-hearted goodness: Sit down, buckle in and prepare to turn off your brain and watch something that will have you going through severe withdrawal when it is all over.",

            "content": "For my first yuri, it wasn&rsquo;t as shocking or surprising as I thought it would be. I guess it&rsquo;s because of the look and feel of the anime &ndash; the girls didn&rsquo;t really look like they would engage in such &ldquo;activities&rdquo; &ndash; they all looked very innocent and sweet. It&rsquo;s a good thing the anime focused more on the dramatic side than sex scenes. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of sex scenes too, which is a huge sigh of relief for me.\r\nPoor Nagisa. She&rsquo;s obviously straight when she first came in and Shizuma had to corrupt her mind. I don&rsquo;t get how Shizuma would fall forsomeone like Nagisa though. Nagisa is one ditzy girl and Shizuma&rsquo;s elegant and classy (with stone cold glances and stares too). I felt like Nagisa would have been better off with Tamao, and Shizuma with Rokujou. Hikari and Amane were a more convincing couple &ndash; mostly because Amane actually looks like a guy and Hikari&rsquo;s very ladylike. \\n\\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s a part of me that still can&rsquo;t believe there were no male characters throughout the entire series. It reminded me even more of the 11 years I went to an all girls school wherein males are a rare commodity. I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed with the characters, because they didn&rsquo;t have much depth in them, so I&rsquo;m thought how interesting it would be if at least one guy showed up. They all had similar personalities too &ndash; with the exception of the older students such as Shizuma, Rokujou and Amane. Chikaru was a joy to watch though. She could very much be Haruhi Suzumiya&rsquo;s long lost sister. I bet if they ever meet they&rsquo;ll have a blast with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art were actually pretty good, as expected of Madhouse. Everything was drawn and designed well, from the meticulous, colorful backgrounds to the characters. The only problem I have is that the characters faces were almost too similar &ndash; the only thing that kept them distinct from each other (appearance &ndash; wise) were their hair color. Speaking of hair color, I noticed that only the main characters had different hair colors. The main characters had pink, blue, orange, etc. colored hair, while the background characters (extras) only had black or brown hair. Because of that the main characters really popped up when in a scene with many people. The character&rsquo;s eyes were very well drawn too. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m actually not familiar with most of the cast, but I do know Mai Nakahara. I loved her as Midori in Midori days &ndash; I really thought she made Midori 2-3 times cuter. She sounded a lot different as Nagisa though, which is why I didn&rsquo;t recognize her at first. I also know Shizuma&rsquo;s VA, Hitomi Nabatame, but sadly Shizuma didn&rsquo;t have a lot of lines for me to notice her either. Most of the scenes with Shizuma has her staring off into space or crying, etc.\\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic&rsquo;s music was very interesting. I love the very poppy and catchy themes of the show. It was a good contrast from the dramatic and moody BGM heard throughout the series. The BGM was classically-influenced, consisting of piano tracks, which fit the sophisticated atmosphere of Astraea hill. I also like the Ai Shimizu and Mai Nakahara&rsquo;s contribution to the soundtrack. They were a joy to watch and they brought something different to the table. I rarely see live action videos as ending/opening theme sequences. \\n\\n\r\nGenerally, the anime is a lot like Maria-sama ga miteru. The two series have a lot of elements in common, such as the All girls&rsquo; catholic school, the French undertones and of course the girl-girl love. There was even a hint of a soeur system during the series. I have to say I still like Marimite more, it is my favorite series, but Strawberry Panic! wasn&rsquo;t that bad. It did get over dramatic sometimes, making me want to take a nap almost every time I watch it, but I still think it&rsquo;s worth watching.",

(if you have ever seen it. if not, then its basically one lyric song played about 5-6 times through the series.) the regular BMG was nothing new either. but the impression wasn't a bad one, and it didn't take away from the series at all.\\n\\n\r\noverall, i'd give the show a solid 8/10. it didn't have the real attention grabbing ability of a true masterpiece, and i felt that a few characters were neglected too much. but other than that it was well worth watching!",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic Review\r\nOr girls maccin' on girls maccin' on girls\r\nLet me start by saying this: &ldquo;If you are a fan of series about girls maccin' on girls because there are girls maccin' on girls in them, you will almost undoubtedly love Strawberry Panic.&rdquo; However, if the presence of girls making doe eyes at each other and blushing constantly does not sound like the primary component of a good series, or the only necessary ones, then you might want to think twice about viewing this particular shoujo ai series. Strawberry Panic does have its share of positive traits, albeit a very small share, but it's maindraw is simply that it features pretty anime girls making googly eyes&mdash;and other significantly less tame things&mdash;at each other for 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic is full of beautiful stills in smooth, pastel colors. The backdrops are wonderfully rendered  and the character art is equally impressive. The trouble begins when those characters begin to move and interact with each other. As a series of loosely animated still images Strawberry Panic fares pretty well, and it usually manages to stick to its guns. However, the series does make a number of ill-advised decisions to break from its formula, when it should have simply polished up what it did have, instead of allowing some of the most important aspects of the series to atrophy in a disappointing display of what happens when good animators&mdash;or at the very least good artists&mdash;decide to get lazy. In a show so focused around drama and interaction between characters, the lack of expressive facial animations and the extensive shortcuts taken with reactions is mysterious, and, frankly, inexcusable. The tennis match late in the series also was a foolish animation decision, along with being a ridiculous and nearly worthless event on all sides, likely costing  significant amount of money and not delivering even a remotely positive effect. In fact, it stands as one of the worst animated sports sequences I have seen in my entire time watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso questionable is Strawberry Panic's reliance on an interesting all-or-nothing sort of fanservice, which features very few low angle shots or panty shots in general, instead inundating the viewer with essentially still images of two girls&mdash;usually in advanced stages of undress&mdash;entwined, accompanied by either slow camera zooms and pans or the constant gasping and cooing of the two girls anime fans are likely to know only too well. A lot of people are into that sort of thing, but it serves no purpose in the series. It does not enhance the romantic elements in any way, and because the fact that the entire school is comprised mostly of lesbians is taken for granted, it has no bearing on themes of sexuality it might otherwise have. If you're into that sort of thing:great, but if that does nothing or even little for you then you aren't very likely to enjoy most of the Strawberry Panic experience, as the entire series hinges on these exchanges to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as audio is concerned, Strawberry Panic is an unimpressive, but ultimately positive, experience. Though the classical score speaks nothing of any ingenuity of any sort, it does nothing to take away from the series and is tolerable at establishing the mood. During the googly-eyed make-out sequences, though, the absence of much noise aside from the dull soundtrack is supremely noticeable, especially when they don't even bother to throw in some sighs and gasps. Variety would have served the soundtrack very well as well, as the same tracks are repeated time and time again. This is fairly common in anime, but it is more noticeable in Strawberry Panic because of the frequency of periods where the music is the only noise.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is similarly vanilla. Most of the cast performs passably, but there aren't any real standouts, and the overall product is mediocre, at best, when it comes to the voice-acting. It isn't likely to stand out as especially bad, but neither will it remain in your mind as a paragon of any kind. I will say, though, that the actors perform admirably in many of the spots towards the end of the show, somehow lessening the idiotic melodrama of the latter events of the series. Much of the mediocrity of the voice-acting is also likely, in part, due to poor writing, which is most certainly present in full force.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the plot, which begins normally and pleasantly enough, but which quickly transforms into a monster of a melodramatic mess. Splitting across multiple storylines like a soap opera on crack&mdash;with delightfully fewer pregnancies and deaths&mdash;Strawberry Panic tries to cram as much drama into as few episodes as possible at every turn, only to suddenly retreat back into a feel good slice of life vibe that carries it to the next dramatic event. These events are sometimes tame events blown horribly out of proportion and sometimes massively ridiculous affairs that actually come off as humorous. By the end of the series it feels as if they were simply proving to the world that they weren't done throwing drama into this sucker. I am still amazed how a series with such a languid pace overall can feel so rushed at the end. Final episodes in anime tend to be  jam-packed, but the entirety of the last six or seven episodes is like a triathlon of bullshit. I kept waiting for it to pull back into safe territory, but Strawberry Panic was content to plunge headfirst into mediocrity and keep digging for the very bottom. It didn't quite reach, but it was one hell of an effort.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Strawberry Panic is a series targeted at a very specific audience, to the detriment of any who watch who does not count themselves as a strong proponent of moe, not as a device but simply for the sake of itself. The series was built around moe, all aspects pointing centrally to accentuate it. The problem is, unlike some moe series which have other things to offer those less interested, Strawberry Panic has very little beyond the moe. The character design and art are good enough, so if moe is something you're really into, Strawberry Panic might very well be a good pick. All others, though, should stay away, as this series was not designed with the general viewer in mind.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10\\n",

            "content": "I watched this when I was 15 and had a completely wrong impression of how to go about a relationship with a girl. Now I find it to be one of the worst starters for girls who are lesbian or bisexual, it teaches you that manipulation and perversion is okay to push onto another, and that consent doesn't matter. At 15 I thought it was magical and incredible, but at 23, just seeing the first few episodes I already feel sickened by the portrayal of lesbians as creepy and abusive, and I think of all the young girls (like I was) watching this and thinkingthis is how lesbian relationships must work, that it's okay to kiss another girl without her consent, or use any excuse to touch her (measure her body parts), humiliate her, and just full on objectify and assault her, and all the while the excuse for these abuses is that the subject is 'too cute', and finding another cute and child-like is enough of an excuse to treat her like an object.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to this signs of embarrassment in another girl is cute and a green flag for more humiliation with sexual undertones. Not only this but any sign of a character being uncomfortable, or non consenting is 'kawaii-fied' and another green flag for disturbing behaviour. It lead me as a teen to the impression that this abusive and fetishizing behaviour is acceptable between girls. \\n\\n\r\nYes as a 15 year old I loved it, all of this I thought was Romantic, and I yearned for the kind of unequal relationship that Nagisa and Shizuma had, but looking back I can see how badly it affected me as a young and confused bisexual female, and I wish I had never watched it and given into the ideas that were put across in this anime. So I refuse to notice anything that might be good in this because it's impact is so destructive to a young girl's idea of a healthy lesbian relationships.",

Do you feel? Do you breath? are you or are you not a individual that can handle this masterpiece as pure as white snow on a enchanting December morning? This incredible adaptation of the famous light novel and manga series that changed a nation goes above and beyond the call of brilliance. On the surface it is just a stunningly animated showcase of vague feelings and a environment that evokes the senses. But as youdig deeper you see the true heart of these dames and what they really seek. The joy of a easy going life but the yearning for something more, something real. The pain and anguish that rattles through all of us when emotions clash, damaging our psyche and leaving us scarred. The trivial love that is not so easy to seize and drives us to stride for greatness. All of this along with medleys that will send you into a state of unprecedented tranquility and voice acting that will be remembered for decades to come. Strawberry Panic is perfection, a truly incredible entry in the history of Japanese Animation.",

            "content": "Warning:\r\n\"Strawberry Panic!\" is a Yuri anime. It follows the story of lesbian\r\ncouples and if you have an aversion to homosexuality, or things of\r\nthat nature, I would not recommend this anime to you.\r\nAnime: Strawberry Panic!\r\nFormat: DVD Video, Region Code 2  (Middle East,Iceland,Western Europe,Central Europe,Egypt,French overseas territories,Greenland,Japan,Lesotho,South Africa, and Swaziland only) Subtitles: None, Audio Track: Japanese: Dolby Digital\r\nStereo\r\nCreator: Sakurako KIMINO\r\nPublisher: Madhouse Studios/IMAGIN (Japan)\r\nRelease Date: 2006 (Japan)\r\nRating: TV-14-SD (May be inappropriate for childern under 14)\r\nGenre: Romance, Drama, Yuri\r\nFormat:\r\nStory:\r\nStrawberry Panic revolves around three all-girls schools: St.\r\nMiator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's\r\nGirls' School. In Miator, Nagisa Aoi is the main love interest of\r\nthree of thegirls in that school and they are Tamao Suzumi, Shizuma\\n\r\nHanazono and Chiyo Tsukidate. In Spica, Hikari Konohana is the main\\n\r\nlove interest of three of the girls in that school and they are Yaya\\n\r\nNanto, Amane Ohtori, and Tsubomi Okuwaka. In the third school, the\\n\r\ncharacters play a very small role in the anime, except for one named\\n\r\nChikaru Minamoto. The other characters there are important to the\\n\r\nstory, but not main characters.\\n\r\n        The story that &quot;Strawberry Panic&quot; weaves is like being on a\\n\r\nemotional roller-coaster. There will be times you feel happy, then\\n\r\nsad, then angry. You will almost certainly laugh and cry throughout\\n\r\nthe episodes.\\n\r\n       The Strawberry Dorms (Proper Name is Astrea Dormitory) is where the\\n\r\ncharacters interact the most. The dormitorys are on the campus of a\\n\r\nvery large catholic church near a lake, which are all located on\\n\r\nAstrea Hill.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n       The animation is amazing, crisp, and clean in my opinion. One of the\\n\r\nthings I have always loved about anime, is the characters eyes. The\\n\r\neyes are used to convey such emotion that you might not normally see\\n\r\nin an animation. When there are close ups, it is even better.\\n\r\n       It is refreshing to see an anime using the older style of animation.\\n\r\nNot making it flashy with bright colors, and CG animation. The colors\\n\r\nand the animation are some what dulled compared to what we are\\n\r\naccustomed to with newer anime. I'm not at all pointing this out as a\\n\r\nflaw in the anime, or saying it is a bad thing at all. It is really\\n\r\nwell done in Strawberry Panic, and it gives almost a feeling of\\n\r\nnostalgia for old school anime. I have been watching anime all of my\\n\r\nlife, and the art in this specific one brought back memories of animes\\n\r\nlike Vampire Hunter D, Iria - Zeiram The Animation, The Fantastic\\n\r\nAdventures of Unico, Sailor Moon, and Speed Racer. All of these animes\\n\r\nare less flashy, don't use bright colors, and don't use CG Animation\\n\r\nbut are still just amazing, great animes, and watching them makes me\\n\r\nfeel great too.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Opening Theme Songs are\\n\r\n#1: &quot;Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete&quot; by Aki Misato (EP's 1-13)\\n\r\n#2: &quot;Kuchibiru Daydream&quot; by Aki Misato (EP's 14-26)\\n\r\nboth opening songs really really good\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending Theme Songs are\\n\r\n#1: &quot;Himitsu Dolls&quot; by Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu (EP's 1-13)\\n\r\n#2: &quot;Ichigo Tsumi Monogatari&quot;  by Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu (EP's 14-25)\\n\r\n#3: &quot;Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete&quot; by Aki Misato (EP 26)\\n\r\nnow #1 and #3 are really good songs but #2 is not all that good, the\\n\r\nSoundscore is done by Composer Yoshihisa Hirano, (Hirano Yoshihisa ,\\n\r\nborn December 7. 1971 in Wakayama Prefecture) he studied composing at\\n\r\nJuilliard School in 1992, and later at Eastman School of Music, he has\\n\r\ncomposed music for concert,dance,film,radio and anime soundtracks. The\\n\r\nsound score for Strawberry Panic is mostly classical style and it is\\n\r\nreally good. Much like the anime itself, the sound score can be\\n\r\nhappy,lively, sad, mysterious, haunting, and overall is just very\\n\r\nbeautiful and really good music.\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\r\nThe Etoile System is a system in place to govern the Internal Politics\\n\r\nand operations of all three school , Etoile is a French word meaning\\n\r\nStar. The Etoile is a figurehead of Astrea Hill and the Etoile has\\n\r\nspecific duties like greeting new students to Astrea Hill,\\n\r\nparticipating in important school events, and acting as a mediator\\n\r\nbetween disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, and\\n\r\nother duties. They have a private greenhouse to grow flowers for using\\n\r\nin school events. The Etoile is a very important and respected person.\\n\r\nEtoile system is a big part of the story. There is a lot more to the\\n\r\nEtoile System but you will find this out when you watch the anime, I\\n\r\ndid not want to give away any more then I had to because this\\n\r\nsomething you have to find out on your own.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great story and well done characters.\\n\r\n-Amazing animation and great art work.\\n\r\n-Really good sound score and great songs.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nNone\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nNow I might go on too much about this so please bear with me. I have\\n\r\nread  a few forum's and reviews that suggest that Strawberry Panic is\\n\r\na ripoff of an anime called Maria-sama ga Miteru. This is something I\\n\r\ncompletely disagree with. I have watched all of Strawberry Panic and\\n\r\nMaria-sama ga Miteru they are nothing alike.\\n\r\n       Now as I said to start, if you are uncomfortable with homosexuality,\\n\r\nthis might not be the anime for you. However it was an amazing anime,\\n\r\nbasically in my eyes about romance, no matter who it occurs between.\\n\r\nIts about the ups and downs of love, and I thought it was great.\\n",

            "content": "I\\'m fair, and yet I have to give Strawberry Panic an overall 8, not only because it\\'s shojo ai and we get to see the goddess character almost get it on with the cute and often clueless main character, but it\\'s also because the painful feelings that the characters have for each other.\r\nStrawberry Panic is a shojo-ai show thorough and thorough. While all the elements in this show would suggest a old-time shojo show - classical music, beautiful senpai with classic shojo drawings of big hair and an elegant aura, a (not so secret) garden, Catholic school complete with a cathedral, a fountain and classrooms,sports that Japanese girls admire, and other classic shojo things, it\\'s clearly a show aimed at male Otakus because of all the yuri scenes going on, with some fanservice for males.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s kind of odd because in the early days of shojo anime, shows with only women or almost only women and very few men in there would never be aimed at males. Boys/young men/men had always watched shows with men fighting in mechas, with swords, on a sports field, fighting and beating each other bloody, and so on. But with the obsessiveness of the Otaku, whom are often terrible when dealing with women - wanting to be with women but severely uncomfortable in women\\'s presence, shows that discover what women do around each other and alone (real and imaginary) are created. \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, conflicts of love go on in this show, as various characters fall in love with different women (heehee), some of their love interests respond in kind, others fail to recipicate. A lot of conflicts and a dark past is revealed when love is being sparked. We follow Nagisa, our protagonist\\'s steps as she slowly discovers this campus, herself, her relationships with her roommate, who\\'s deep in love with her, her friends and surroundings, and her real love - the seemingly distant and playful Shizuma - the top of the top of the 3 campuses. Other characters also get developed.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s hard to definite this as a shojo show or not. I call it the &quot;shori&quot; show - shonen fan service with Yuri elements in it. I simply cannot classify it as a shojo show because too many lesbian love in there, I mean, sometimes there are almost no normal female relationships in this show. \\n\\n\r\nLove the design of the characters, they\\'re all beautiful,  or cute, and all distinctive enough. The music is OK for me. Mostly classical and light music with nothing standing out. The characters are nicely fleshed out, with some shojo and imaginary lesbian stereotypes - this is made for shy male otakus after all. The plots are shojoesque with infighting and competition over the top title of the 3 campuses but it isn\\'t terribly boring. Maybe it\\'s because I love seeing shojo-ai and I appreciate the seiyuu for their work in this show.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for all who love shojo-ai/yuri. This is a shining example of yuri done right.",

            "content": "(updated 9/20/18 for format and slight content revision)\r\nHi! Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! As always, the synopsis is your friend, as I'm going to deal in the broader strokes. MINOR SPOILERS may appear, though I do try to keep those to an absolute minimum. Strawberry Panic is loved by some, and hated by others, because it's really basically just an anime soap opera. It is over the top, often cheesy, and if you don't think too much, really, really fun. This was my first full blown yuri anime, and it's not nostalgia colored, this review. As always, the crew will not earn aspot on the RTLR wall for rose colored glasses either. I've seen so many more, so much more beautifully done (Aoi Hana comes to mind) but I still cannot back off the fact I had fun watching this anime!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe setup with Nagisa is a bit cliche if you ask me, though SP turns it up with Shizuma's sudden, intense interest in her. This anime lets you know right up front what it going to be going down. I found the story of cat fights, senpai worship, and unrequited love to start out mundane, but yet well enough done to hold my interest. There are several relationships, and hints of relationships that are interesting enough to watch and learn about. Love triangles, loving someone who loves someone else, and even the evil girls trying to use rape at worst to sexual assault at best to sway someone's heart is enough action to keep the mind from wandering. There is also more than one 'couple' that matter in the show, a trend most anime avoids. We have at least 3 pairings and a possibly of a few more by the end that all get fair amounts of screen time. And that ending! I'm American, and I prefer stories to go out on a bang, and boy does this one ever! No muted 'maybe' endings here! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI love the way the series is drawn. I love Shizuma's hair, I love the expressive eyes, I love the gothic lolita uniforms, and even the other two schools uniforms. The lines tend more to 'clean' than detailed, but the whole package comes together very nicely and in a very fitting way. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nMy only sound gripe: those birds! Often when opening a scene they show the outside of the building, with birds chirping as they are known to do. For some reason those chirps are 3 times louder than the dialog or even music in the show! I almost developed a Hitchcockian fear of birds! Otherwise though, the sound was really good. Shizuma's voice actress nailed it, as did Nagisa's. The ending song is good, but weird in being live action. The second ending song is also live action but a bit out of place. Otherwise, no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThis is where the drama comes in and the shine begins. We have a girl who begins basically as a total slut, and as the series progresses, we learn that she is in fact in great pain and acting out in a way we might find inappropriate but makes sense in the overall scheme of things. The only problem with her arc is that the writers didn't seem to think it through and tossed in a plot twist out of the blue just to facilitate the situation that leads to the trauma. There is also a mannish girl who is called a 'prince' of her school who falls for a beautiful girly girl, giving us a 'traditional' lesbian relationship. The evil girls have a twisted, manipulative lesbian relationship that is just utterly incomprehensible at times. The cast is quite large, with the 'club always looking for what club to be' and the younger children on the way up in the school, along with the stern Student Council president, and her contemporaries from the other two schools. There's a lot of people to keep up with, but it becomes fairly easy quickly, as you develop a favorite couple, and gasp and gawk as they turn the drama to 11. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really liked this because I did watch things like Days of Our Lives with my mom as a kid. I don't mind the overblown drama. If you can't see past that, then you should for sure take a pass on this anime. I loved seeing what event was on the verge of destroying the precious relationships, and cheering when they made it through against all odds. Is it cheap, cheesy, corny, silly, and over the top? Yes to all those things. Does that mean it isn't fun? Not in the least, long as you go in with your eyes open. It's high school lesbian drama, not Shakespeare! \\n\\n\r\nIn closing, if you want to just veg out and check out an anime that doesn't require much thought and don't mind the titillating nature of the show, this is one to watch. This is firmly yuri, with implied (and a few scenes of literally being between the sheets!) sexual scenes in places, and it makes no bones about who's with who as a couple. It's a ton of fun if you turn your brain off and just let the soap bubble. Strawberry Panic rates one pic of Shizuma and Nagisa intently staring in each others' eyes as well as one of Amane and Hikari in the same pose on the wide RTLR wall. Feel bad for Tamoe-chan though. This is one high school worth visiting!",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, but given this is my favorite anime I figured I'd give it a shot. I started watching this anime because I wanted a yurified yurifest with some yuri on top, which, to my great satisfaction, i got. However what I wasn't expecting is a touching(and at times heartbreaking) love story that most people who watch this anime seem to over-look. Basically, you have three girl schools, which means three harems, two of which have their own love story, and one of which is for hilarity, comic relief, and general epic-ness. During the more Slice-of-lifey parts of the series, the charactersof the three schools hang out and interact together, but as far as love goes, most romance stays inside it's own school harem.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. This is a very character driven story, and as such there are very few outside influences that actually drive the story forward themselves. Of course, this is a love story, so that hardly comes as a surprise. Many of the events come across as cliche' and sometimes down right cheesy. While there are many moments that are truly touching(I've been brought to tears on multiple occasions), there are others that just make you want to gag. Luckily, these points aren't nearly common enough to totally ruin the enjoyment of the series as a whole, and the rest of this series make that barf worth swallowing.(This being a character driven story, i'll cover that in the \"characters\" portion)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10. This isn't to say the art itself was poor, there are some truly spectacular scenes on Astraea. However, for the majority of a 26 episode series to take place in the same locations, the same forest, the same dormitories, the same everything, is just tedious. The lush hill-top Citadel and mansions, surrounded by forest and lake, are beautiful for the first half or so of the anime, but when you start noticing these backgrounds becoming used and reused through-out the series, they start to become old and tired. There are certain points every episode or two when new locations will be introduced and provide a refreshing change, but for the most part, you better get used to those trees and hallways.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Hands down, as far as openings go, this anime has two of the best I've ever heard. Both of them are amazing both in terms of music and accompanying animation, and serves the mood of this anime... dare I use the word... perfectly. Unfortunately, the music played during the anime itself lets this category down slightly. As if this wasn't a big enough problem, the \"orchestra-ish\" music, while in all honesty is somewhat enjoyable on it's own, only serves to add to the \"cheesy soap-opera\" feel this series has at times, especially when played during the already nearly unbearable corny moments. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10. This is where Strawberry Panic truly shines. One of the greatest casts I've seen in a yuri, and in anime in general. With three schools, each with their own unique \"onee-sama\" character, love interest, \"love interest's best friend\", loli, and a fair amount of other, equally awesome cast members, there is no shortage of characters to fall in love with. By the end of the series, you would have to be heart-less to not feel a sense of attachment to the majority of them. Most anime with large casts become annoying and tedious to follow, but the characters in Strawberry Panic are all so unique and interesting, that the large-cast-harem theme was handled, dare i say it again, perfectly. When this series ended, I was almost as sad about missing the characters themselves as I was that the anime was over. The only gripe I can come up with is that certain characters, such as Chiyo(resident loli of Miator) fall into generic anime arch-typesy, though this is hardly noticeable in the diverse cast SP offers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. What can I say? Anime that I enjoyed as much as this one are few and far between. I laughed , I cried, I am head-over-heels in love with 90% of the characters. There is one thing I would like to address that didn't belong anywhere else in my review... the fan-service. I think one of the biggest things that make me love this series so much is not the presence of fan-service, but the type of fanservice that it has. It has a fair amount of ecchi, bath scenes, shower scenes, \"waking-up-naked-together-after-a-night-of-sweet-passionate-love\" scenes and other \"convenient censoring\" moments. What this series doesn't contain, however, is just as important. You will not find panty-shot upskirts, you will not find boobs that seem to defy the laws of physics and anatomy, and you will not find \"Oops I tripped and my face is in your cleavage\", or anything to that effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. On my list, I gave it a 10 as well as a comfy spot on my favorites list, but I want this review to be as un-biased as possible, and i cannot ignore it's flaws. I leave you with this: If you want a realistic, true to life romance-drama that addresses the difficulties of life, angst and love, search else where. Search FAR FAR AWAY, because you're not even in the ballpark, kid. If you want a sweet, touching, heart-warming love story about an all-girls school, my friend, you've come to the right place.",

            "content": "Strawberry panic seemed to be a popular 'yuri-shipper' anime so i decided to give it a try..sadly i was a bit dissapointed.[i know there a few of my MaL friends who loved it ..so sorry and hear me out] I'll start with the story. \r\n Story left much to be desired. The pace of it for was felt so slow. im not sure if i was the constant --lets have a tea party-- or -- make some cookies-- fillers but for me, it felt as if the episode wouldnt end. [not good if im constantly looking at the timer to see if and ep isalmost done yet] Not to \\n\r\nsay there arnt shipper-arks that i wasnt curious about their ending but where\\n\r\ni was taken in the story was either typical or bland. Somthing that also bothered me was the lack of male characters...ANYWHERE!! no male teachers, vistors...brothers...umm..fathers! O.o someone has to have dad iright?! i understand this is a girls school and yuri..but come on! the setting of the story also bothered me they seemed to never leave their school area ..either to shop or do typical high school stuff [in im guessing japan] \\n\r\nwhen they did leave it was for romantic tryst in the country or priviate beach. the only thing these girls did for fun were tea parties,school politics,\\n\r\nand make up diff clubs everyday[where id be xD if i was stuck there] just not realistic..even for anime. \\n\r\nArt was pleasent to the eye. i did like their character design; Main\\n\r\ncharacter shizuma's eyes were very pretty. The design of the outfit design was great w/ the 3 schools having diff dress. i liked the layout of the school\\n\r\nand strawberry dorms w/ it heavy cathloic school feel. some charc seem to \\n\r\nhave huge craniums and somes the their legs look like flesh colored sticks,but\\n\r\nstill not many complaints.\\n\r\nMusic meh..not a strong point it seems not even for people \\n\r\nwho enjoy this series intro and endings were cutsy ,but not really catchy\\n\r\nor anything memorable..neither was backround music..so meh\\n\r\nCharacters i found to be a bit sterotypical either for their \\n\r\ncharacter type or for women in general. Good ex: is Amane: silent,but\\n\r\nkind prince type [she even rides a white horse..star bride..really *face palm*] and the shy sweet princess type:Hikari. is it suprising that she fell for Amane..nope!  even if she has perfectly nice,funny, smexy roomate \\n\r\nright next to who'madly in love with her Do they do anything unexpected with this story..they tried xP u wana see a good girl whos \\n\r\na prince w/ girl princess story watch Rev. Girl Utena..unless u love predictable story. The fact the complex feeling of love and desire wre either limited to one person or solved w/ tea parties or solved w/ tears[via end w/ hikari and her secrect admier] of hopful --i know you love me,but i wana be just friends\\n\r\nsooo can u help me put on this dress for the ultimate date w/ girl i choose over you..thanx ..friend!-- that irked me be/c no one would do that. it also \\n\r\nkinda botherd me that EVERYONE was girlxgirl..there was a mention of male fiance at one point but that was it. but i guess if i was stuck in strawberry dorms for 3-4years id sneak into my roomates bed too xD \\n\r\n  So overall This anime could have been much better but hasnt turned \\n\r\nme off of yuri ill just research better on the story next time. Wasnt all bad \\n\r\neven if it took forever for a kiss to happen [and it did!] It had it cute moments\\n\r\nand sexy-steamy moments [some still a let down] but still i cant say it was enjoyable to watch. more frustrating than anythign else. So if you like pridictable story, stereotypical main characters, constant tea parties spiced\\n\r\nw/ few steamy yuri-shipper scenes then this is one anime u shouldnt miss..otherwise wait for another more intracate yuri to come out. \\n\r\nwhich is what i should have did x3\\n\r\n--feel free comment to me/give feedback if you have some gripes/compliments--",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is a sort of difficult review to write. I remember initially watching the show as it first came out. I remember being well into the show's story and enjoying it enough to have a sort of urge to continue watching it and I was done before I knew it. \r\nStory:\r\nProbably the strongest aspect of the show is the story as it centers around an all girls school centered on a hierarchy similar to modern day democracy. It follows a girl who just transferred there and quickly draws the attention of the Etoile (similar to, say President of the Body) and from there itfollows her and she becomes custom to the life in this school. An interesting choice the Anime makes is that there are no males present, or even mentioned specifically in the entire series. The show explores same-sex relations very liberally and doesn't glorify it like most anime centered  on the topic.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the character designs and I thought the art designs of each of the scenes were beautifully done, but the animation is classic fare. The Music was above average and complimented the story but wasn't especially catching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how the plot doesn't really start unfolding towards the end, it's a very character driven show. Development is key and that's what Strawberry Panic is best at. You often see the characters change and strive for what they want. The strongest aspects is how the important characters are explored through their past so we, the viewers can have some introspect on what they've experienced and how they've grown.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf I could fault Strawberry Panic for anything, it'd be for the fact that it can be quite vanilla and predictable at times. It's strongest aspect, however, is how it's unique from other anime in the genre, and is most cases it's parts are all above average. The story and characters all come to together in the end and it has a very satisfying conclusion. If you're a fan of shoujo-ai or just romance in general this is definitely worth looking into.",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is one of the first yuri shows that I've seen that managed to hook me through the full 26 episodes. While the anime isn't something that I'd consider to be a masterpiece, it was enjoyable. \r\nThe MAL synopsis gives you a good idea of what the anime is about, so I'd recommend reading it.\r\nSTORY: 8. Overall, the story is pretty realistic in the sense that there aren't crazy plot twists or random events that shift the story of the anime. The pace of the anime is very drawn out for 26 episodes. I felt that the pace wasn't too slow, though others mightdisagree. Aoi Nagisa transfers to a new school, and drama stirs up over time around the characters because, girls liking girls. However, there wasn't any parts of the anime that really caught my attention, but the story is very solid and there wasn't any fillers in any of the 26 episodes, which is a huge plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8. For an anime that is in 2006, the art wasn't bad at all. Can't really comment too much because we're talking about an anime released 9 years back from the time this is written.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9. The music was on point. Can't really complain about that. I liked how they used a lot of instrumentals and piano, which matches each and every scene's mood. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8. There wasn't any character that stood out to me. Lots of nice girls here and there, and some standard personalities that you could find in many animes. On the flip side, there wasn't any character that I could say that I really hated, so I'd say an 8 is good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8. Somehow I managed to watch bursts of episodes. There wasn't fillers, which would be something that a 24-26 episode anime could have, so I'm happy about that. The characters were kawaii overall, and with the yuri aspect, it wasn't overdone.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8. If you are watching this for the yuri, just know that it isn't huge on girl on girl action compared to ecchi/hentai anime. If you are put off from this anime because it was released in 2006, I would reconsider... it's a pretty good watch. The romance was there, and so was the drama. Just don't expect a perfect anime out of this one.",

            "content": "Its been a while since I've written a review on this site so bear with me just a little bit..\r\nStrawberry Panic is a yuri anime~basically its a girl to girl love type story with a hint of lesbianism mixed together. Not that i have any complaints against that, since its my first time watching a yuri anime i was like WTF at first, but the anime was actually better than i thought it would turn out to be. Now on with the reviews:\r\nStory: The story was honestly not the best factor of the series, but it is an interesting one. It revolves around the mainprotagonist Nagisa Aoi, her transfer into Astraea Hill Girl's Academy, and the relationship she forges with her schoolmates inside the academy. There are 3 schools total: the Spica Academy, Le Rim, and finally Miator(the school Nagisa is in). Over the course of her time inside the school, Nagisa encounters many fellow students who she eventually develops good relationships with along with her fellow dorm roommate and friend Tamao. Because the story is not very solid, and doesn't really have a centralized plot it tends to waver and confuse the audience which explains why i won't give it higher than a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As expected of Madhouse, the art was actually very well-designed and developed. Although it wasn't the greatest artwork ever, its still really good for a yuri anime. The background sceneries, the characters, the Strawberry dorms, and the school itself were drawn well and had good use of coloring to top it off. For some reason the art reminds me of some classic paintings from the past with vibrant and rich textures to blend in altogether.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music i thought was pretty decent. I only liked the OP theme from episodes 1-13 and it was very catchy, i even have it on my Ipod. The ending themes were not very good and were just a turnoff for me. Although \\n\r\nsome of the piano music played by Nagisa and Shizuma were really good. Nothing too much to say here..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I do love the characters in this anime quite a bit, however i was somewhat disappointed by the fact that they didn't quite explain each of the characters in detail, so it was kinda vague in that sense. The only characters that had stories to them were Nagisa (our heroine) and Shizuma Hanazono. Shizuma I thought had the most emotional story out of all the characters, and i thought she was the most developed character in the series.. when you watch episodes 17-19 the real reason behind her emotional facade shows in detail and its really quite compelling. As for the other characters, like Tamao, Rokujou, etc..the characters weren't explained well and it left things hanging at times. Nevertheless, the characters expressed various emotions, feelings for each other, and might i add very kawaii in a good sense. Here you will see where the yuri fits in:\\n\\n\r\nNagisa and Shizuma \\n\\n\r\nAmano and Hikari (Great couple I might add!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed the series it was definitely a good series to watch. At first i was a bit skeptical about watching this but after reading the light novel, I just felt that i had to watch the anime and it didnt disappoint. I've enjoyed it maybe you might too. I'm actually not a big fan of yuri, but there wasn't that many sex scenes in the series which was actually good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: an 8/10 i give it. Strawberry Panic isn't for everyone..you will either like it or not like it that's all i can say, but my recommendation is read the light novel first to get an idea wut the story is like, then watch the anime or vice versa. But for me i've enjoyed it to the point where i might watch it again in a future date.\\n\\n",

In my though \" what the heck is that, you can be etoile even if you doesnt love her just do your job and graduate, you god wont angry with you even if you have lover beside your etoile partner\" hahaha\\n\\n\\n\r\nbasically i love the story, it give you a feeling of curiosity and wanted more and more , complex , compilcated, and enjoyable to watch",

Maria Sama on crack, or maybe a healthy dose of GHB.\r\nLesbian schoolgirl love story.\r\nThe story introduces everygirl, Nagisa, who gets sent to a private all girls' boarding school where she meets the mysterious, aloof (I hate that word, but it's fitting), and oft-worshipped silver-haired maiden Shizuma. Shizuma immediately wants to jump Nagisa's bones, but for no real good reason. Maybe becuse she's an Etoile, the elected focus of worship in the school. \r\nThe rest of the show focuseson Shizuma and Nagisa's budding relationship and I'm left scratching my head AS TO WHY, since the reason is delayed in presentation. Like, 14-15 episodes in.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other girls who do the nasty, and we're treated to their backstories and obvious denoument of their infatuation--but for some reason I don't seem to remember them all that well and they don't seem that important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo, um, back to Shizuma and Nagisa. Once Nagisa realizes that a creepy older woman wanting to sleep with her is alright, we're treated to why Shizuma is like the way she is. Guess what, there's a TRAGIC BACKSTORY TOLD IN FLASHBACKS, albeit this is when the show arguably becomes somewhat tasteful and takes itself seriously and tries to treat the characters with some actual depth, especially at the point where grief ridden Shizuma forces herself on Nagisa. This moment, shockingly, is very realistic and sad (and likely unintentionally so). That and the fact that unloading dark, unresolved emotional baggage on someone does not make them love you more, like most other anime seems to imply. \\n\\n\r\nThese few episodes really shone above and beyond the rest of the anime and showed an alarming insight that quickly was buried and abandoned for more filler. The problem is for every convincing chrarcter and plot development, we have a bunch of hormone-ridden fluff to distract us and kill the pacing. Add that with the inexplicable introduction of a Tamao, Nagisa's roommate, was clearly meant to create tension between Nagisa and Shizuma as she has no other role and the show falls apart again.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the entire series is totally redeemed by the incredibly absurd and entertaining ending which is the most bizarre parody of the Graduate wedding scene since Grampa Simpson ran off with Marge's mother. It almost makes me think different people wrote different arcs, and they all hated each other and finally settled on the most pointless resolution to their conflict.",

Girl goes to an all-girl school, meets one special person, discovers she's in love with her, etc. It sort of sounds like fanfiction that a 12-year-old could come up with, right? Not to mention the main character is a total Mary Sue. Everyone is in love with Nagisa, and the only times she messes up is when her seme Shizuma comes to rescue her. Character development is absolutely terrible. I mean, EVERY SINGLE GIRL in that school is a lesbian? That seems highly unrealistic to me... And of course, the short, shy girls areukes where the tall, robust girls are semes. And the girls of focus in this anime (Nagisa and Hikari, respectively) both of their roommates are in love with them, and they're in love with generic semes. It seems like the stories of the characters are copying off of each other, even though they're in the same anime... It just all seems so unoriginal, all the girls in the schools seem the same! We have the ~*kawaii*~ uke and main character that everyone loves: Nagisa, the silent semes that also everyone loves: Shizuma and Amane, the one-sided loving best friends: Tamao and Yaya, the chibi quiet girls: Hikari and Chiyo, the antagonists: Momomi and Kaname, and the tsundere: Tsubomi. It's all so unoriginal, but I guess if that's what you were looking for, then you'll enjoy this anime very well.",

Love is something strong that can't be understood with mere words. Picture yourself in a fateful encounter with a person that once you met you cannot get enough of. That is the smallest fraction of what love is and can be related to in words.\r\nFor our protagonist Aoi Nagisa lies ahead a school life filled with laughter,joy,cries and sorrow as she meets Hanazono Shizuma, a mysterious figure of little words and a great deal of feelings. Feelings that blossom like a beautifuland fragile flower bud when it is properly nurtured or withers when not properly cared for by her fateful encounters with the main heroine.\\n\\n\r\nI have been enthralled by the story so I do not have much to say about the artwork other than edgy character faces that i do not enjoy. What I really liked about the artwork are the background scenes of the Hill where the action takes place. Everything down to the last detail is like in a well made painting.\\n\\n\r\nI am not one to talk about intros and outros so I will go on and say that it is an understatement to say that the music is largely exquisite. Masterful piano plays emphasize the dramatic moments as well as the undisturbed sceneries as well as the happy moments. A well made repertoire.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are largely similar with small differences with a few exceptions. Most of them are happy smiling girls that get along just fine with nothing worrying them. It is later on during the series that the character reactions become interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI have really enjoyed the story that left me with a burning ache in my heart throughout the episodes. This is what the series left me with. Are you curious if that ache was extinguished or about what will the series leave you with... only one way to find out!",

            "content": "Spoilers present, but no spoiler on key details of the plot.\r\nABSTRACT: Among Yuri anime, Strawberry Panic is one of the most well-known titles, and is actually one of the better ones, though in no ways a masterpiece. While it appears that people's attitude towards it is mostly polarised, and that people's attitude largely depends on whether they like the canon pairings.\r\nWhen it comes to reviewing, this is one case where it's inappropriate to make a completely rational approach.\r\nFirst of all, is the anime Strawberry Panic a parody or overkill?\r\nMy opinion is that although it's likely meant to be a parody, it comes out as moreoverkill than parody. Thus, we're still going to view SP as more of a serious anime than a clichestorm parody.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-- Section 1: A Brief View of the Plot --\\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic takes place in 3 affiliated all-girls(lesbians??) Catholic schools. Since the main cast is full of lesbians, one could easily imagine love triangles going around.\\n\r\nOne of the main characters (Nagisa, the MC1) enters the school to be drawn to the 'goddess' of the school, while her roommate also develops a crush on her.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've said that...\\n\r\nThe main focus of the plot is the 2 love triangles in the anime, which are quite blatantly shown early on in the anime.\\n\r\nBoth have many similarities and can be described in the following formula: (Note: Some characters display improperly on MAL. {== means a pointed arrow i.e. unrequited love)\\n\r\nG == MC {== Rm (G for goddess, MC for main character, Rm for roommate)\\n\r\nAnd while in both cases, the relationships between MCs and the respective 'goddesses' are those of consensual love, both pairings have their own reasons for people to dislike them.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the 2 love triangles, there are quite a lot of slice-of-life elements in the plot, which are quite fun to watch, and the SoL parts even have some awesome moments which put other pure SoL anime to shame.\\n\r\nPersonally speaking though, some of the SoL parts are not as funny/awesome compared to other SoL parts, and if the story had better pacing, the drama part could have been done better.\\n\\n\r\nNow, since the focus of the anime are the love triangles, we will have to focus on...\\n\\n\\n\r\n-- Section 2: Characters, and Ship to Ship Combat --\\n\\n\r\nFirst let's talk about the 2 love triangles. Though they share similarities, they're not exactly identical.\\n\\n\r\nShip combat 1: Nagisa x Shizuma VS Nagisa x Tamao\\n\r\nThe 3 characters involved respectively have these traits:\\n\r\nAoi Nagisa: Innocent and kind-hearted, but sometimes simply too innocent(this trait becomes more annoying later on, particularly in the Drama Festival part).\\n\r\nSuzumi Tamao: One who is always willing to offer her love and kindness -- regardless of whether she gets rewarded.\\n\r\nHanazono Shizuma: I don't think in the inside she's bad, but still she's one emotionally hurt and in turn goes after many girls, very likely hurting them in the process. Shizuma is one who leans on pushing her own demands.\\n\\n\r\nThis ship combat is the harder one to review.\\n\r\nIf you view it from 'the process of falling in love', this part is very questionable. Sure, love isn't exactly a reasonable thing so we can't blame Nagisa for being drawn to Shizuma, but still, why is Nagisa drawn to Shizuma? Only because Shizuma is beautiful, and is idolised by other students. This qualifies as some bad scriptwriting.\\n\r\nWhat makes up for it though, is the backstory and the character development of Shizuma. Though some may question if Shizuma's character development is significant and/or thorough, 'the power of love makes people undergo character development' is one thing that's not so properly portrayed by most yuri anime, so plus on SP for this.\\n\r\nStill though, the reason that Shizuma undergoes all the character development is rather like Shizuma is, in fact, so... dependent underneath. So we can only hope that she doesn't get emotionally hurt once more. (Note: To keep the amount of spoilers low, I'm not going to further discuss about it)\\n\\n\r\nNow, is this love triangle forced? Personally speaking, it is not nearly as forced as the other love triangle, but still it seems as if a girl like Tamao can't get the love she desires ever since Nagisa is drawn to Shizuma. That's rather sad.\\n\\n\r\nShip combat 2: Hikari x Amane VS Hikari x Yaya\\n\r\nThe 3 characters involved respectively have these traits:\\n\r\nKonohana Hikari: She is drawn to Amane and that's mostly it, some of her traits are shown but come out as not memorable.\\n\r\nNanto Yaya: Like Tamao, she is always willing to offer her love and kindness, but she is not that satisfied with what she is rewarded with.\\n\r\nOhtori Amane: As unmemorable as Hikari: she appears indifferent towards many things in life, until the ending. Her appearance is that of a very masculine appearance.\\n\\n\r\nHave you heard of a fairy tale called Snow White and the Seven Dwarves? In the story, Prince Charming rides his horse to save Snow White, and that is called an act of true love.\\n\r\nThis is essentially the same thing that happens with this love triangle. Amane rides her horse to win Hikari's affection, while later she rides her horse to save Hikari. Can this be more cliche? It is so cliche that it's boring.\\n\r\nAnd plus, almost the ONLY depictions of love between Hikari and Amane are the 'Amane saves Hikari from the bad guys' events and a certain typical Korean soap opera event later on.\\n\r\nTo summarise it, this part is so forced and cliched that the only way to interpret it is some parody on the stereotypical masculine 'Prince Charming' type of female. But even then, it's not interesting to watch (subjective opinion).\\n\\n\r\nOther characters:\\n\r\nKaname & Momomi: Not the 'big bads' but still the villains in this anime. The main question about them, do they get more likable in the end? My answer is, they do to a lesser degree.\\n\r\nRokujou Miyuki: This is where I should make an explanation. Unlike Tamao's feelings for Nagisa, Miyuki's feelings for Shizuma is not really in the territory of unrequited love (probably borders on it but friendship dominates the relationship), and the relationship between Miyuki and Shizuma is that of close friends who know each other well. (For this part, it's a plus for the anime.)\\n\r\nSide characters: Aside from Chikaru, most side characters are your normal diabetes-inducing moe characters, which are commonplace in other anime, and come out as unmemorable. Chikaru though, stands out from all of them.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll end this section with some personal thoughts on one question: Why are opinions among the audience mostly polarised?\\n\r\nI suggest that it's partly because some people stop caring for a character when she has left a bad first impression on them, and thus the impressions the character leaves on them remain largely unchanged.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-- Section 3: What ideas does the story convey to us? --\\n\\n\r\nThe point that makes Strawberry Panic unique compared to other yuri anime, is that it's focused on the question:\\n\r\n>> What kind of relationship is more than friendship?\\n\r\nHowever unfortunately, the answer the anime gives to the question is not really satisfying.\\n\r\nAs already discussed, the Hikari & Amane arc is too cliched to be treated seriously. (The problems in this arc are still present, of course)\\n\r\nIn the Nagisa & Shizuma arc, although eventually Nagisa & Shizuma turns out to be an acceptable couple (personal opinion), what about Tamao's efforts then? Though we can't say love is a 100% reasonable thing, the anime seems to be deliberately trying to make Tamao act as kind and helpful as possible, while rewarding her with just 'I'm sorry, but let's just be friends.' Seriously, Strawberry Panic... What are you trying to tell us then?\\n\\n\r\nThis is basically the single unique point the story conveys to us. The point 'what it means to be an Etoile' is not dug into deeply.\\n\r\nLove development part is fairly good, but not the best it can offer.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5.5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nMinor aspects:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Art: 7.5/10\\n\r\nThe art style is somewhere between a distinct shounen/seinen and a distinct shoujo art style. It's closer to a seinen style as I see. Visually, the art is attractive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\r\nMost tracks are quite well done, but allow me to introduce you to the biggest exception: The 2nd ED.\\n\r\nThis ED is the ending theme for the latter half of the anime (except Ep26), which is when the story heads into a serious direction. ED02, however, is not just of mediocre quality: It's too happy and upbeat!

The generic animation, however, goes hand in hand with the god-awful Victorian music, which is played throughout the series.\r\nIf Strawberry Panic removed every scene where the characters are either staring into space while public domain Bach music plays, the series would be a good 12 episodes long. \r\nIf you're not a fan of Jane Eyre, Little Women, or Sense and Sensibility, don't waste your time onthis shoddy yuri.",

Second,i'll tell y'all first that this review isn't mainly about how the series goes because i think u can see how it goes clearly on the synopsis,this review is more likely how i enjoy the show and how i feel towards the story,characters and others aspect which built this anime up to the surface. Third,i'd like for everyone knows that i'm straight so i may can't bring up a good reviews as everyone has expected to read but don't worry,even though i'm straight i enjoythis anime quite a lot to the point where i want to do a review which i rarely do before\\n\r\nall of u may be wondering now , \"why a straight like her watched a yuri anime and even made a review of it ?? is she mocking us ?? is she making fun of us? is she demeaning us ??seriously wth is she thinking ?\" and ect\\n\r\ni'll tell u right before hand that i'm not here to mocking u nor making fun of u. actually,idk why am i watching this anime myself,maybe i'm just lost and want to know myself more whether i'm still straight or not..well,u can say i'm a straight that trying to peek on yuri's lion hole\\n\\n\r\nok then here we go reviewing~~~\\n\\n\r\n1.STORY & ART\\n\r\n~~i don't have any particular problems with both. Instead,i'd say that the art is nicely done and the story plot twists is quite interesting,so i'll give it both 7/10\\n\\n\r\n2.CHARACTERS\\n\r\n~~one elements which make me stick on to this anime until last episode is the characters which is quite interesting to be watched also,i can't help but to think shizuma as bishounen and amane as oji-sama(prince) and they made me realize that i'm still straight,so i'm quite grateful to them. With that in mind,i continue on to the last episode and i'm glad i did,it was totally worth it and so,i give it 8/10\\n\\n\r\nwell,overall,this is a great show,just watch it and u'll know wht are the good points of it later or sooner\\n\\n\r\nok now this is about my comments and complaints on the show so don't take it to heart,just take this as a sobbing from a lil child ;)  \\n\\n\r\ni don't reallly understand about the etoile things,at first it looks like a normal model-for-students-like election. but,if it is really like that then why is almost everyone make a fuss over it ?? then at some points,it turns out to be a wedding-like ceremonial and at last episode,shizuma looks as she is a guy who snatched the bride-chan away from a wedding..ughh,i really can't understand it well *sigh*\\n\r\nnow i've said it,i felt much better\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nagisa Aoi was just an ordinary girl.  She wasn\u2019t especially smart, she wasn\u2019t especially pretty, she wasn\u2019t especially noble...  There was really nothing special about her.  Then, one day, she transferred into Miator Academy, one of three all girl schools located at the top of Astraea hill, a sacred place where no males are allowed to enter.  The three schools are affiliated, and they only accept female students from proper, upstanding families...  Well, there\u2019s one other possible qualifier, but we\u2019ll talk more about that later.  Students are expected to live on campus in two person dorm rooms, and asa right of passage, first year students are expected to act as maids for their elders.  Luckily, Nagisa was able to avoid this fate, transferring to the school in her third year of education because of...  Reasons...  And it was at this school that the once ordinary Nagisa would become...  Well, still an ordinary girl.  There\u2019s no evidence that that part of her is ever going to change.  But somehow, despite this ugly duckling slowly growing into an average duck, there is one thing about her life that is about become extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nFor you see, at these three schools way up on Astraea Hill, they elect more than just a student council...  They also elect an Etoile, who represent the school in all of it\u2019s glamour and prestige.  For now, the Etoile is Shizuna, a tall mysterious girl with long white hair and a spirit that radiates with ennui and depression, and for seemingly no reason at all, she appears to have taken a very special interest in young Nagisa.  From long measuring glances to sudden, uninvited embraces that come within a hair\u2019s breadth of ending in a sultry kiss, the most beloved and respected student on campus has her empty eyes on Nagisa, and they\u2019re filling up fast.  Nagisa has no idea how she attracted this kind of romantic attention, but luckily for the older girl, she doesn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry to try to lose it, either.  As the two young ladies become closer, and the bond between them begins to form, they\u2019ll find that the Astraea Hill School System is both a political and social minefield, full of backstabbing, sabotage and political intrigue.  Will our perfectly ordinary heroine brave the dangers of Astraea Hill for the sake of a love that\u2019s truly extraordinary, or will her destiny fall short in the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe Strawberry Panic anime was produced by Studio Madhouse to capitalize on the successful magazine run of a series of short stories, all focusing on different all-female romances taking place at the Astraea Hill Schools.  Productions from Madhouse rarely ever have generous amounts of money poured into them, which can lead to even beloved classics like Trigun looking wonky half the time, but on the plus side, some shows can still flourish visually without a lot of financial backing, like the dialogue-heavy Death Note.  Well, Strawberry Panic may have a lot of dialogue in it, but the nicest thing I can probably say about it is that it\u2019s not the worst looking anime I\u2019ve ever seen.  They clearly tried their hardest with it, but there\u2019s only so much a bare bones budget can do when it\u2019s attached to a light, fluffy show that doesn\u2019t have the benefit of heavy shadows or obscure angles to hide it\u2019s flaws.  I\u2019m honestly not sure how good this show even COULD look, as it\u2019s clearly the kind of show that Kyoto animation was born for.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse tries to hide the limitations of this show\u2019s movements, and for the most part, it does manage to pull it off, relying on as many staticky conversations and panning shots as it possibly can, and it treads water at least well enough to...  well, not enough that the shoestring budget goes unnoticed, but well enough that you can ignore it and focus on the story.  Having said that, the very second the motion needs to pick up even the slightest bit, the returns can be flat out embarrassing.  Characters walking often look like profile images bouncing up and down as they move across the background, a tragic horse accident in the latter episodes is clumsy enough to bring inappropriate roars of laughter to what\u2019s supposed to be somber scene, and if you can tear yourself away from the beautiful piano melody in one particular scene, you\u2019ll feel duped when you realize that you\u2019re just looking at a panning shot where a couple of frozen characters just move their upper arms ever so slightly.  You can\u2019t even watch a character fall down the stairs on screen, no, there\u2019s a very intentional cutaway.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a nice looking show in terms of design, however, as every named character has a specific look that you probably won\u2019t forget, even if you haven\u2019t seen them or thought of them for extended stretches of episodes.  In fact, I got so used to having their looks inform their identities that towards the end, I briefly mistook one of the main characters for being two separate girls all because her hair was sometimes down.  Their designs are generic, but they\u2019re at least different enough to distinguish one girl from another, and the use of different uniforms for each school also helped this to happen.  Miator has black uniforms, Spica has white uniforms, and Lulim have yellow vests paired with checkered skirts, all three of these designs being popular ones from the history of high school anime.  Oh, and of course, there are also maid outfits present.  The backgrounds are serviceable enough, and although it doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the story, the architecture is also really pretty to look at.  There\u2019s also a lot of flowers...  Yeah, I know, it\u2019s a yuri, big surprise...  But they\u2019re not just border decoration, there\u2019s a greenhouse full of them, and a lot of care clearly went into their rendering.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, whatever beauty the visuals may lack is made up for tenfold with the soundtrack.  The instrumentation is mostly comprised of violin, piano and cello, and while the standard slice-of-life music that occurs while nothing\u2019s really going on can be a bit on the underwhelming side, there\u2019s a lot of melancholy and pain in this anime, and the music translates this beautifully.  There are a couple of classical songs that are played when Shizuna and Nagisa are bonding over the piano, the instantly recognizable but still very well-chosen Moonlight sonata and Maiden\u2019s Prayer.  As for the original music, Yoshihisa Hirano put together a powerful score that almost manages to lend gravity to the melodramatic nature of the series.  There are several emotionally gripping moments that work hand in hand with the score to rip your tear ducts out through your throat, But at the same time, honestly, there are several moments in this show that are so uncomfortable that the music will wind up being the only thing you WANT to remember them for.  Kaori\u2019s theme tends to be a popular favorite, but I strongly prefer the tension present in Unmei and Fui ni Semararete.\\n\\n\r\nThe aversion to movement is unfortunately carried through to the first opening, which appears to do the bare minimum on a visual scale, showing the different characters in leisurely glamour shots, reacting to the camera before the next character can get their spotlight.  The song, Shoujo Meiro de Tsukamaete by Aki Misato, is a fine song on it;s own, a little on the generic side but still well orchestrated and catchy.  It\u2019s a good enough op, but it;s also a really predictable one, so I\u2019m glad the second opening threw all of this convention out the window.  It\u2019s called Kuchibiru Daydream, once again by Aki Misato,  but it comes off as a lot more lively and inspired, with more force and flow behind the vocals.  The imagery in this opening is also a massive improvement, as it still kinda reeks of budget restrictions, but it\u2019s able to do a lot more with it on account of the fact that it TRIES to do a lot more with it.  This mirrors the level of effort present in the anime, which started off a little lackluster before picking up steam towards the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe endings, surprisingly enough are mostly live action.  You don\u2019t see that very often nowadays, and for good reason, but these ones actually do manage to skew past the awkwardness thanks to the chemistry of the two ladies on screen, Mai Nakahara and Ai Shimizu.  They also happen to be the singers of Secret Dolls, which has a distinctive goth-rock feel to it.  Makes sense, I guess, since they\u2019re both all dressed up in goth-loli costumes, which I would consider overkill if it didn\u2019t fit the doll theme so well.  They sell the yearning between them mostly through facial expressions and clever directing, and finish by sealing the song with a kiss.  The same two singers reprise their roles for the second ending song, Ichigo Tsumi monogatari, which is...  A thing.  A really weird thing.  It goes off in an entirely different direction with creepy singing paper cut-out CGI, and that\u2019s all fine compared to the fact that the energy and set design remind me of Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi, which is one of those things nothing should ever remind me of .  So yeah, the second opening and the first closing were really great.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since there\u2019s no English dub, I guess we should get right into the writing, huh?  Well, I do have a few comments about the Japanese sub, even though I\u2019m woefully underqualified to judge Japanese acting.  First of all, there are a lot of times where the lip flaps didn\u2019t match the voice of the people speaking, which is a mistake I thought only dubs could make, and it\u2019s a shame that I was only able to watch it with subtitles, because I had trouble keeping up with the dialogue whenever my eyes started to involuntarily close over how bored I was.  Oh yeah, we\u2019re starting on this note;  There are a few things Strawberry Panic is known for, and I\u2019m pretty sure one of them is just how much of a train wreck the story and plot are.  That is, when there\u2019s even story and plot present.  right off the bat, we\u2019re introduced to some meek little redhead with so special or distinguishable characteristics in a cast that\u2019s already bloated from the start, and while it feels like you\u2019re supposed to care about her, you\u2019re never told or shown why she\u2019s worth that kind of attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe only interesting thing we learn about her...  Possibly ever, now that I think about it...  Is that she has the ability to uncontrollably run through forests like she\u2019s a WWE wrestler waiting to encounter a rope to bounce off of.  Aside from Shizuna\u2019s abrupt attraction to her, nothing else of consequence happens for a very long time.  We\u2019re dropped into a story that has at least a dozen characters, little to no attempts at world-building, and a bunch of creepy non-consensual almost-kisses being our only clue as to what or who we\u2019re supposed to care about.  I would honestly recommend keeping a pillow handy during the first six episodes, and on and off after that, just in case you decide that a dream might be more interesting than what\u2019s going on onscreen.  It meanders through fields of inconsequential fluff before it ever approaches anything resembling a point, wastingtime on characters who wind up getting shoved to the side anyway, including almost everybody from the Lulim school, like a loli with a teddy bear, a pair of useless girls who I just wound up calling Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and one named Chikaru who I wish was important, because she feels really likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a point, of course, but it takes an inexcusably long time to get there, and even then, there are problems present.  The actual meat of the story is the romance between Shizuna and Nagisa, and while you\u2019re never really given a clear reason as to why Nagisa would develop feelings for the older girl, Shizuna\u2019s attraction to her is VERY well defined, and while I won\u2019t spoil it here, it carries an admittedly compelling layer of conflict and tragedy to the idea of the two of them being together.  Besides, while Nagisa\u2019s feelings may be undefined, they still feel more than real enough to make the audience genuinely care where their romance goes.  They\u2019re not the only major romance, though, as there\u2019s another sub-plot involving an equestrian and a young blonde student, and it starts out okay...  It\u2019s really sweet and heartwarming at first, then it dives into a bit more drama as it evolves into a love triangle, but it all goes south as the two villain characters standing in their way get drawn in, making it a love pentagon, with enough going on in it to make it feel beyond convoluted, and that\u2019s BEFORE the hokey-as-fuck amnesia plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, thinking back, I\u2019m tempted to say that Shizuna is the only character in the cast who really feels developed and fleshed out by the end.  We know what happened to her, why it happened, how it started, how it made her the person she is, and how it motivated her actions in the present, and there\u2019s a lot of room to interpret whether she\u2019s a selfish character, a sympathetic character, or both.  For the most part, everybody else has personalities that have been defined just enough to differentiate them from each other, but their personalities are almost entirely informed by their role in the story and their interactions with others.  With the exception of a few girls from Lulim, you won\u2019t have any trouble remembering who\u2019s who, but  you\u2019ll have a hard time caring for any of them, aside from the two main couples and maybe Nagisa\u2019s roommate, but that\u2019s a hard maybe.  You\u2019ll probably wind up hating the little girl with the teddy bear...  Well, a lot of people seem to, I personally just ignored her...  And there are a few characters who, after they\u2019ve disappeared for a while, might just coax a \u201cHey, I remember you!\u201d out of you when they appear again.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what?  There was one story arc where everyone generally came out looking good.  Yeah, some of the best moments in the series take place when Shizuna and Nagisa are alone(depending on your tolerance for questionable levels of consent), but the one arc that really worked as an ensemble was when the three schools decided to put on a play.  They pick the European classic Carmen, and just about everybody plays a fun role in this arc.  Egos are challenged in the cast listing, Nagisa gets a little extra depth, the villains get to be nasty for what feels like no real reason, there\u2019s intrigue and last minute improvisation, beautiful costumes...  The problem is that it only lasts two episodes, despite spanning a period of several weeks.  In a smarter anime, they\u2019d have expanded this arc to at least a quarter of the show, using it as a backdrop to other less consequential stories, tying them into it so that there\u2019d be something to look forward to through other boring or forgettable moments.\\n\\n\r\nBut they don\u2019t do that here...  Strawberry Panic never comes near the level of effort or inspiration that it would take to come up with a solution like that.  Well, fine, you wanna get lazy?  There\u2019s another solution they could have tried...  Cut the length of the series down to 13 episodes.  There\u2019s a ton of material they could have cut, and I\u2019m sorry to say, as pleasant as it was in the beginning, the entire Hikari/Amane/Yaya thing could have gone bye-bye along with it.  I mean, seriously, would anyone miss that sub-plot?  They could have cut the story down to just focusing on one school, Miator, and still had enough time to develop Nagisa and the few supporting characters around her more properly.    The problem is, and I can\u2019t believe more people haven\u2019t noticed this, is because this isn\u2019t a show you\u2019re supposed to think about.  You\u2019re supposed to be drawn into the emotion and the romantic and political intrigue, because if you stop to think about what you\u2019re watching for one second, you\u2019ll realize that very little of what you\u2019re seeing makes even a lick of sense.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, I can\u2019t be the only one who found the Etoile system to be confusing as fuck.  Let\u2019s see if I\u2019ve got this right...  It\u2019s an elected position where you\u2019re basically an ornament, meant to uphold the beauty and nobility ideals of the school, and you\u2019re not the Student council president, even though you have to sign a lot of undefined papers.  You apparently keep this position until you graduate, which can take up to six years...  If you follow the plot closely, Shizuna\u2019s been doing it about three years...  And it\u2019s vital that you have two of them, but if you lose one for whatever reason, they just carry on without making any attempt to replace her.  Oh, and you can be from different grades, so what happens when one graduates and the other hasn\u2019t yet?  And are you supposed to be a couple with your partner?  If not, why would you have to run away and abandon the election just to be with the person you love?  And why do the people in charge tell prospective candidates that they don\u2019t have a choice when they clearly do?  And why is it okay for one school to not submit any candidates?  Is any of this explained in the source material?\\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s one other thing I had trouble understanding, which hopefully won\u2019t get me into any trouble...  Why and how is everyone in this school a lesbian?  I\u2019m not trying to be homophobic here, but something\u2019s off about that ratio.  If I were to transfer into an all asexual school, for example, I\u2019d find that disturbingly off-putting.  I\u2019d be asking a lot of questions, such as if we\u2019re being segregated, or if they\u2019re quarantining us to protect the local birth rate.  I wouldn\u2019t want everyone in my environment to be like me, so why is everyone in this school a lesbian?  Is it like a Sorting Hat situation?  I\u2019ve heard that one of the best ways to make LGBT stories compelling is to include conflict revolving around dealing with ignorance and bigotry, but none of that exists here, it\u2019s just a sapphic paradise where love between girls is the unquestioned norm.  Nobody even brings up what their futures will be like once they graduate and reenter Japan\u2019s heavily patriarchal society, which almost makes the series feel vapid.  It has no stakes.\\n\\n\r\nNo, I know exactly what they were going for with this...  It\u2019s an escapist fantasy.  You know, the kind of story where the reader can experience a situation or lifestyle that would be impossible or really troublesome in real life.  It\u2019s unrealistic by design, and it\u2019s pure self-indulgence.  This series was written for the viewer to escape into a world where everyone\u2019s a beautiful lesbian, with no conflict outside of their romantic woes and social standings.  Now, is that a bad thing?  Maybe...  Honestly, it depends on who the fantasy is designed for.  A lot of lesbian media is intentionally designed to exploit queer people for the sake of fetishizing them for the enjoyment of straight males, and that was my initial impression of the series.  Of course, there was also the possibility that the lesbian fantasy in this show was created as an escape FOR lesbians, especially when you consider just how badly oppressed they are in Japan NOW, let alone in 2006 when this series was released.  It\u2019s an important distinction to make in cases like this...  Who\u2019s it for?\\n\\n\r\nTo answer this question, I took to social media, and asked for anybody who\u2019s seen the series to let me know what they thought of it, along with their gender and sexual preferences.  I didn\u2019t get a lot of responses, which isn\u2019t very surprising when you consider how personal a question that is, but what was surprising was that the few responses I did get were from queer women who had generally favorable opinions of it.  They were well aware that the show had issues, and that it\u2019s problematic in spots and a little dumb, but they all said that when they watched it as teenagers...  Remember, this show is now 11 years old...  It helped them come to terms with their sexualities, and even taught them that it was possible, even okay, for a woman to have romantic feelings for another woman. They even said that the material that was obviously meant for titillation was just as enjoyable for them as it was for presumed straight male viewers, barring the few non-consensual moments.   Admittedly, my sample size was small, but it was still very revealing in terms of what it means to the people I thought it was just exploiting.  It\u2019s not much, but it does earn the series a little redemption in my book.\\n\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic is available from Anime works, a division of Media blasters.  The 5 disk thin pack has unfortunately doubled in average price since it was released five years ago, but used copies on Ebay can be found at a reasonable price.  The original novels are available stateside from Seven Seas, and the original manga is available from the same company.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the process of reviewing this title has been enlightening, my opinion on it has remained largely unchanged.  I still consider it a train wreck, full of random fluff, way more characters than it could handle, and an ending that was entirely unsatisfying and wound up raising far more questions than it answered.  Having said all that, I do understand that it has an important place in LGBT anime.  It doesn\u2019t tackle the struggle to define ones\u2019 self, as Utena did, and it doesn\u2019t satirize the oppressive patriarchal society of Japan the way Yurikuma Arashi eventually would, but it does manage to present the idea of same sex romance in a somewhat progressive way, and I can\u2019t really fault it for that.  It presents an escapist fantasy where queer women both younger and older can set aside the idea of forbidden love and guilt so they can just feel normal in a world that\u2019s constantly telling them they\u2019re not.  I still can\u2019t justifiably call it a good show, but at the very least, I do now know that there are people out there that I can confidently recommend it to, even if that demographic is a small one.  I give Strawberry Panic a 4/10.",

            "content": "So. Strawberry Panic. I don't know exactly why I sat through this entire series... Maybe I felt that it was a yuri rite of passage, that I had to see the most cliche catholic school girl yuri. The first half of the series I gave my full attention to, meanwhile the second half I doodled to. However, the first half of the series seemed to drag by with lots of fillers and such, while the second half went by pretty quickly.\r\nSo first thing is things about this anime that I really love: Their outfits, and the architectural designs in the anime are really great. Theydid give some thought to the character development of Shizuka.\\n\r\nAaaaaand... That's about it... I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nI mean don't get me wrong... It wasn't unbearable to watch. I enjoyed certain parts, and I needed something cliche and bad to destress from my dumb life. But alas, this is a review, so I will now go ahead and say everything WRONG with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo first off, I do believe they derail completely from the plot of the actual manga (I own the first volume), which I know many anime do, so that's not the problem... But... WHY IS KAORI'S DESIGN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN THE ANIME THAN IN THE MANGA? It's weird, and there doesn't seem to be any reason for it. Did they just want to make her cuter? The anime is also completely missing a bunch of characters that the manga had, and I could be wrong, but I believe they also added characters to the anime that weren't in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay, this is going to sound crazily picky, but I can't stand how from the back of Nagisa's head all you can see is her pony tail... That's not how ponytails work!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation... Don't even get me started... That animation was SO BAD. SO. BAD. 'nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so this type of story (drama and romance) heavily relies on character depth and development, right? Well, guess what this story is lacking!\\n\\n\r\nNagisa's backstory story is unimportant, because her purpose is mainly for girls to be able to \"plug themselves in\" as the character. I did get invested in her and Shizuka's romance, but the passion was sometimes just not there, from both sides. Perhaps this was just a budgeting problem, and they couldn't animate the characters doing more than the minimal amount possible. (this anime definitely had a budgeting problem, no doubt) I often found myself saying in my head \"Why aren't you moving? Don't you feel anything?\"\\n\\n\r\nThey have a few supporting/main characters who lack character depth and any kind of personalty trait and in my opinion having characters who are important to the story be shallow is unacceptable. I'm not gonna get to into it, though. Just know I warned you.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was nice, but the opening and ending songs weren't good, especially the second ending song always ruined endings that were super dramatic or sad. Buzzkill.",

            "content": "Well, this was an....experience. And that's about it. Compared to newer titles like Sakura Trick and Bloom Into You, the flaws in Strawberry Panic really shine through. There's so much to go into so I'll try to break down my gripes with this anime.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe anime does have a clearly defined story and major plot points that make up this story but it meanders so much and is packed with filler that makes it a slog to get through. It does its best to build this world and flesh out the history behind the schools and how they're all connected and what their functions arebut it just leads to a bunch of melodramatic politics and painfully slow set ups for other plot points. Students are shown being chastised for sneaking around during lights out and never get caught again. There are a bunch of painful cliches and there are entire episodes I wanted to skip because the series made it hard to care. It's just oozing melodrama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen there is animation, it's kind of bad. The backgrounds are nice enough and I enjoyed the architecture. The one area that actually looks very nice is the greenhouse, but the flower art seems to have more thought and effort put into it than most of the art in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI might be alone on hating the soundtrack for this series. The background music can often be shrill and ear piercing, and because there are a lot of melodies that are so distinct that get reused often, I got tired of hearing them over and over again. The lip flaps are wonky and don't match in a few places as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this anime is the protagonists love interest. We are supposed to view her as a brooding, beautiful, tortured soul that is loved and respected by everyone. But what we're introduced to is a woman that refuses to do her most basic duties and plays with the emotions of those around her because she's brooding and lonely. She goes out of her way to hurt her friends and the main character due to her incredibly selfish nature. I could not stand this character and sadly she's given the most backstory. But for me, this past did not in any way excuse her actions. One of the other love interests for the main character that is far more caring and shown to have been far better in every aspect is shoved to the side in favor of this selfish character.\\n\r\nThe main character is plain and almost serves as a husk for the viewer to project themselves on. There are multiple romance plots but because the characters involved in them are so one dimensional and boring even the multi love interest love polygons are boring.\\n\r\nMost of the women portrayed have love interests in other women, and while not necessarily a bad thing (kind of the point of the show) there could have been a scene where characters caught in the act of such things are reprimanded and warned to not do it. Then at least there would be some stakes involved with where and when these people reciprocate their feelings. On top of that, they throw themselves at each other without consent and it isn't shown as a problem until much later on in the series. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to enjoy something when the plot keeps getting diverted and then you're given more melodrama from undeveloped characters that you can't possibly care for. I fell asleep watching this so many times and would restart an episode because it is filled with so much useless dialogue and is lacking in animation. I had to stop the series halfway through and then watched the entirety of Bloom Into You before going back to it. I needed to find a better romance anime and watch the whole thing in the middle of this one to keep watching it. That's how boring it is. It tries to paint itself as mature but lacks a likable cast and consists mostly of meaningless plot developments and painfully overblown melodrama.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this only to see where things can go horribly wrong in this genre. Then to compare that with some of the more modern titles that have come out that are more accurate, more romantic, and far more wholesome than Strawberry Panic. Otherwise I would not point anyone looking for a good romantic story to watch it.",

It's feel is unique and, although may appear old to some, possesses a style that's beautifully it's own. The characters are wonderful and I came to love each one, as each possessed a presence that is strong, with likable and interesting traits all in their own way. Also I found the issue that can be found within other romance anime, this being when the focus is drawn to other side romances, it can be rather frustrating, to not to be the case within Strawberry Panic. Each episode contained a wonderful innerstory as well as a powerful addition to the overall anime. If there was anything to put negatively however, it may perhaps be the end, which felt slightly rushed with the way the storyline is tied together. Nethertheless, this anime will definitely have you caring deeply for the characters and is likely to end with you wondering how you could possibly fulfill your life any further once it's complete. \\n\\n\r\nSo to you, my ponderous anime consumer, I say give it a chance and Enjoy! ^_^",

            "content": "I don't remember how I found out about Strawberry Panic, but I'm glad I did, because it was quite an enjoyable show. But enjoyable does not translate into genius.\r\nStory: The story is interesting, especially if you're into lesbians. And as a yuri genre anime, what else would you expect? The show is not episodic, but the episodes don't segue well to each other. The story is about a girl that's new to the school, and her first day there she meets the Etoile, kinda like the Queen (sorta) of the school and there is an immediate attraction between the two. One of the faults ofthis anime is that it was extremely predictable (at least i thought so). One of the guidelines to write a review is try not to reveal spoilers, and I won't have to, you'll probably figure it out as you watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The girls were drawn in a typical shoujo type of art, tall looking thin girls with large breasts, and huge eyes (but not too big...the eyes). The animation is consistent throughout, though not amazing. Even though the art was fine, one of the things that i noticed was that almost all of the girls' faces look alike, the only difference being the difference in eye shape (some of them). The only other way to really tell them apart without listening to them is by their hairstyle and uniform.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack of the anime was fine, but nothing impressed me. One of the biggest deciding factors for a good grade on sound for me is a good OP/ED, but neither caught my attention enough for me to look for the OST. The background music is okay, but i think they use the same one for many &quot;dramatic&quot; situations, making it old (unless i can't tell the difference, and they weren't the same)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pretty much what you see is what you get with your characters. They don't really progress, personality wise, but there are lots of changes in relationships. Again predictability plays a factor here, and what you expect the character to do, they'll most likely do. The characters are unique and don't have overlapping counterparts, but there are lots of the same character relationships, and example being... love triangle with one unrequited lover that loves the lower level characer, one upper level character that loves a lower level character, and that lower level character admires/loves the upper level character\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this show, not a lot, because i noticed some of its faults, but enough for me that i could watch it again and not consider it a waste of time. This is far from a masterpiece, but it might be good fun to watch, especially if you're in a &quot;i don't want to watch yaoi/shonen-ai anime dangit, let's watch some yuri/shojo-ai&quot; mood\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was a good anime, and it could've done better in my opinion if the story had been a bit more compelling, and not so predictable. And though this is personal opinion, i was kind of disappointed at the ending (though i expected it), with none of my characters matching up with who i wanted. :(",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that I had no preconception of what this series was about, or the genres that it would be labelled as.  This being said, once the initial episodes were over, I relised that I was watching my first yuri (is that the right word??)  What was the first thing that I did when I discovered what I had uncovered??  Looked at the DVD rating of course.  PG-13.  That to me meant 26 episodes of cutsy girls and no skin.  This made me sad.\r\nI wanted to dislike it.  I wanted to turn it off.But the series quickly grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was simple.  A transfer student starts her first day at St. Miator's All-Girl High School and goes through the trials and tribulations that accompany high school life.  She embraces love, friendship, heartbreak, and adventure with a virgin outlook towards it all.  If this was the entire plot however, it would have been near impossible to stretch it out to a full 26 episode series.  Inter-twining Nagisa's (our lead characters) story, are numerous (and dreadfully wonderful) sub plots involving dozens of secondary and tertiary characters.  I believe that its these plots and situations that keeps the audience craving more, even if they don't want to.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls get up to the usual young Japanese girl adventures: tea parties, school clubs, autumn walks through cherry blossom leaves.  Some excel through academics, others through athletics.  They fall in love.  Some find the girl of their dreams, others will have their hearts crushed.  It's high school.  It's elegently destructive.  It's horrendously addictive.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most appealing points to this series are the characters.  Comprised entirely of girls, (and I do mean ENTIRELY) they range from very cute to absolutely breathtaking.  Most have a completely unique look so the viewer has no hestitation in the recognition of their favorite girls.  Many of the main characters are dotted with colorful hair and often times, a costume other then the standard school uniform, both helping in differentiating betwwen the large cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe personalities vary as immensely as the girls themselves.  For the most part, all the girls have your standard giddy, naive, super cutsy, attitute.  But all have \"that one thing\" that makes that person stand out among the others; be it an obsession, a unique voice, they way they carry themselves.  On top of that, the entire lead cast is very different from the standard, high school drama.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd if the girls themselves are constructed with perfection in mind, so were the backdrops and scenery surrounding it all.  No detail is overlooked in the animation for this series, and it is vividly appearent throughout (incuding the OP and ED credits).  Exquisite shading and lighting truly brought every scene to an almost magical feel.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said however, there is still something about it (especially in the beginning) that I truely disliked.  Perhaps it was the strong use of dull shades, prominant primarily in the character design,  Perhaps it was the overused storyline.  Regardless, whatever the reason, the series needed some time to grow on me, I was not immediatly enthralled.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are into yuri, then this title is a must see.  If you are in to romance, this is a must see.  If you are into beautiful animation, this is a must see.  Honestly, if you willing to overlook a few minor defects and embrace what this series has to offer, you will embark on a worthwhile journey.",

            "content": "For my anime reviews I am going to review the anime on the order of which you would experience while watching an episode of the anime that is being reviewed.\r\n1.Art - The art for Strawberry Panic was very good.  Everything was hand-drawn and it kind of legitimacized itself with that.  The character models were all original and they were all fricken'\r\nkawaii.  The only flaw I could find in the art style was that the legs of the characters were ridiculously \r\nsmall; they were like tooth picks.  That being said, how the original artist draws their characters is totally up to themand it is completely my opinion that the legs were to thin other than that, bravo!  I absolutely loved the art style.  I will give art a 9.\\n\\n\r\n2.Sound - The soundtrack for this series was the best iv'e ever heard from an anime.... period.  I can't even explain what I went through with this soundtrack, but I will try.  I started out absolutely hating the soundtrack and I even thought it was the worst soundtrack I have ever heard but boy was I wrong.  The soundtrack round-housed me in the face and I was fully realizing that it was the best soundtrack I have ever heard.  It fitted in to the story PERFECTLY and at times I firmly believe that the music made the story even more awesome than it already was.  All I have to say is just listen to the OST, it's perfect 100/10.  GO LISTEN TO IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!   Please ; )\\n\\n\r\n3.Character - Now, I couldn't say that I liked the characters or didn't like them.  What I mean by that is this.  The characters all had unique personalities and the way they acted was very likable.  Some of the characters were super girly but then some of the characters were more mature.  On the other hand, almost none of the characters in the anime had NO backstory and I would not have minded if the backstory took up some more episodes.  Because of these factors, I can only give Strawberry Panic a 7 for character.\\n\\n\r\n4.Story -  Well, here goes for the story.  It was not that bad or good.  Of coarse the romance in this anime was top-notch but I wasn\u2019t surprised by that because it is known to be a good romance.  It was a very sad story and a lot of times e was very emotionally attached to this show, it had me saying \u201cdang this show is way to good\u201d.  That being said, The story did have a lot of holes in it\u2019s plot and it wasn\u2019t the best plot to start with but it is the best yuri I have ever seen.  I\u2019ll give the story a 7.\\n\\n\r\n5.Enjoyment - Well this anime was a roller coaster of emotions for me.  I\u2019ll have to tell you the truth, when I first watched this anime I dropped because I wasn\u2019t enjoying it.  A while ago I rediscovered it and it has now become one of my favorite animus.  It is definitely the best yuri anime I have watched and I loved it so much that I am bold enough to say it is one of the best romance anime of all time.  You need to go and watch it right now because it is like nothing else you will ever watch.  I couldn\u2019t quite call it a masterpiece but it is up there in my anime list of over 70 animes.  I enjoyed it at a resounding 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an overall 9.\\n\\n\r\n*I will also recommend that this anime is only watched by a matured audience.\\n\\n\r\nCaution:\\n\r\n!Keep in mind this anime has nudity.\\n",

            "content": "When people talk about Yuri anime, Strawberry Panic! is the name you mostly hear them refering. \r\nYou could say it is the Mainstream thing of Yuri, most people that watch Yuri anime, watched this anime, becaming the anime, almost like a rite of passage to the Yuri world.\r\nThe first yuri I seen was a OVA, so to a extent, I could also say Strawberry Panic is my first Yuri anime. Was it worth of my time? Definitly, but not without its flaws.\r\nThe story is very preditable (cliches), and while I managed to enjoy it (there were some highlights, like Shizuma past), the pacing was notalways the best with some episodes being boring, while others keep the viewer focused the whole time. \\n\r\nThe conclusion satisfied me, but ultimately it depends on the characters pairs you \"ship\". It also seemed a bit rushed, I would had prefered if they had given more time to showcase it, \"isntead of it happening so late\". A epilogue would also add value but well....\\n\r\nDecent story, just dont expect much from it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I m impressed, both OP's are great and catchy, I still want to go back and rewatch both, but both ED's really sucked for me, with the those japonese girls appearing and getting all lovey-dovey, it was just weird for me. The voice acting is great, and the song tracks felt in place with the scenes.\\n\r\nThe art is lovely, most characters can be extremely cute to watch, and those mushy mushy moments are some of the highlights of the anime, no doubt, nothing negative to report.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a light Yuri, there is non hentai content here. So for it to be enjoyable, the characters have to be so, the romance between is a key feature!\\n\r\nNagisa, Tamao and Shizuma(the main three) are the center stage, there are some episodes manly dedicated those some more secondary pairs/\"groups\", and those characters are decent, but they felt a bit too shallow in terms of development, when faced to these 3. And with some exceptions like the extremely enjoyable and energetic Chikaru (which should had have more screentime because she is really that likeable), the majority of the cast is merely there to support the rest, which means that the main three, have to be interesting enough for you to fully enjoy your time with the series. For me they are!\\n\r\nNagisa can be a bit shallow and too cheerful at times, but inside the genre, she felt natural for me, for the most part, I liked her alot. Her relation with Shizuma (that is at first a playboy feminine version, slowly developing her feelings for nagisa), it the spotlight of Strawberry, the reason I enjoy the anime so much, there were downtimes, but when those two got to the work, doing what a (light) yuri anime is supposed to do (leave it to your interpretation), I loved it, it was soo cozy and heart-warming. Tamao is also extremely likeable and IMO the best friend a girl could have.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the enjoyment I got from SP!, is because I liked the main characters alot, the way they related to each other. The OPs also fit the mood of the anime alot! They couldnt be better.\\n\r\nAnoter key factor to enjoy the anime is accepting girls to girls relationship, if you dont, it will be a major negative in play, since there is never a male soul, or voice in the anime, so the romance is all between girls. \\n\r\nThe romance was indeed slow paced, which also made the story have its downs and ups, but by the end I apreciated the development put on the characters. Maybe it wasnt a truly happy ending, not for everyone, but it is the happiest ending possible for me, and I can conclude that Yuri romance well done, is just great! \\n\r\nA dramatic and romantic anime, with some more light toned cheerful moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEverything added, if you are a Yuri fan, and didnt watch Strawberry Panic, you have, it is like a classic for its genre. Probably one of the best yuri conceived. I reccomend it!\\n\r\nIf it is your first time with Yuri content, just keep in mind, what a Yuri is about, be more free minded, give it a try, and like me you may came to see Yuri potential for romance at a new light. \\n\r\nPanic, dunno, but for the Strawberry part, it surely present me a sweet experience. :3\\n",

The characters are flat, the plot nonsensical, and it suffers from several tragic flaws.\r\nThe largest of these is that Shizuma comes off as very rapist like. Nagisa doesn't exactly resist her advances, but it's still really creepy.\r\nThe other really big flaw is that the show's beta couple is unbelievably dull. You don't care about them and want them to go away whenever they are on screen.\r\nNow, I did say it was not /objectively/ good, and this is because Strawberry Panic is one of my absolute favourites because it's unambiguously Yuri. Lots of kissing and a fair amountof sex, too.\\n\r\nStrawberry Panic's saving grace is actually it's best kept secret; It's SUPPOSED to be bad.\\n\r\nIt satirizes anime like Marimite by turning all of the tropes up to eleven and then playing them with a completely straight face. The show is set in a catholic school, but everyone is having premarital lesbian sex all over the place.\\n\r\nBottom line: This is another show that you either love or hate.",

The all have a background story but not everything will be told.\\n\r\n*Enjoyment: Easy to watch but emotional! Get a blanket, some sweets and make a comfy evening. Maybe actual a thing you should watch on your own\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this Anime and would recommend it for everyone who enjoys a beautiful romance and maybe even for those who usually don\u00b4t watch stuff like that! \\ (^-^) /",

            "content": "Nothing like watching a chick get a harem full of only other chicks !!!\r\nThis was a fun show. I had this show tabbed sense the beginning of October and had constantly put it off with finding new shows to watch. I finally forced myself to sit down and watch and i was not disappointed.\r\nI greatly love the atmosphere the show makes. With the school and the residents. The show takes place on an island witch helps just make it more interesting with the School being on a island in the middle of the ocean with just a town quite far away from the school. Ikind of wish the island was smaller and it showed some characters every now and then going into the small little town. \\n\\n\r\nI also very much enjoy the relationships between Shizuma and Nagisa. One of the more interesting couples. I kind of dislike how they had Tamao have a crush on Naigsa. Seems needless and leaves a sour taste in your mouth how they left. \\n\\n\r\nNaigsa having a harem of girls only is pretty funny and especially how she doesn't even seem to notice how many want her. In the end they really aren't trying to get with her but more just of being best friends.\\n\\n\r\nShizuma is defiantly one of the more interesting characters. You know right from the start that something happened with her to make her the way she is now. When you find out about her former lover it's actually kind of sad even though we never knew about her. Kind of makes you wish nothing bad happened to her. But having Shizuma slowly start opening up more and more too Naigsa is one of the entire highlights of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's worst part in my opinion is defiantly the side story and the relationship between Haraki and Amane. The show is constantly shoving their relationship down our throats when we just want to see Shizuma and Naigsa.  You don't really buy the relationship between Haraki and Amane and it feels artificial. Anyone would buy the relationship more between Haraki and her roommate Yaya. It makes no sense that Yaya and Haraki aren't the couple focus. Even Yaya had a crush on Haraki. I actually find the two people that are constantly harassing them more interesting even though one of those two constantly sexually assaults Haraki. I'd rather see those two over Haraki and Amane.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is also the entire thing where a Student council president wants Amane to be the next Etoile. No reason is given and it takes away more from the story. Having the Student council president be kind of a Bitch then have her be nice the 2nd half of the show was a weird change but welcomed. \\n\\n\r\nI love how the show is subtle too. We are shown that Naigsa is coming to terms with her feelings for Shizuma even though she is a girl. Naigsa not knowing how to feel is confused. The show doesn't just straight out tells us. It actually treats the audience with some respect and not assuming we can't figure it out ( Even though i did see some people in the comments totally oblivious as too what's happening) \\n\\n\r\nNaigsa is also kind of eh i guess from episode 17 to 20 ( Around those episodes) She knows that Shizuma is going through lots of pain from having to remember memories from the past two years with her former lover. Shizuma never talked to anyone about her feelings and has bottled them up. So when she finally breaks down on Naigsa and starts balling her eyes out and Naigsa doesn't comfort her but instead runs away. I find it weird and out of place.She is acting overly selfish. \\n\\n\r\nI'm also not a fan of the ending with Amane and Haraki winning. I don't even like the idea of Shizuma not being the Etoile anymore. I do enjoy that both Naigsa and Shizuma finally fall in love. I just wish this happened two or three episodes before so we can see them in their relationship afterwards. I'd even love seeing both Naigsa and Shizuma the next summer vacation actually going somewhere and spending time.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing i'd like to mention is that the animation can be kind of lazy at times especially with the lip movements. This is mostly a thing in the beginning. The animation itself is nice and you can forget at time that this has the 2006 type of animation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a great show.",

            "content": "Okay well recently I felt like doing some anime re-watches, and Strawberry Panic was one of the anime that came to mind that I wanted to watch again to see if my opinion (rating) of it changed any. Well, it turned out that the rating remained the same, but some thoughts resurfaced from the previous time I watched through this Yuri Romance Series. \r\nI will tie all that in though in the Story Details below:\r\nThe Plot in Strawberry Panic tells the story about a young pink-haired girl who finds herself upon the premises of three prestigious and ever so elegant Academies. Menator, Spica, and LaRim. This young girl, who goes by the name Nagisa Aoi, joins the Menator Sect of the Academies and undergoes training toward becoming a possible Elotile. \\n\\n\r\nNow the thing is, an Elotile must be in a pair of two! Not just one. The purpose of this is so that whichever mistake one of them makes, the other can be there to correct that mistake, and put that side of the Elotile on track again. Being in a pair allow them to bring both care and discipline to the students under their guidance. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story continues to center around the work and becoming an Elotile. In fact, there really isn't too much of a story in Strawberry Panic other than the prearrangement's that the students undergo toward being possible qualified candidates for this election of honor. Of course, not just anyone stands a chance, especially Tsubomi (:P) for Elotile Grace, like Nagisa or Tomoe obviously do! And especially not like First Class Stars like Amane do when it comes to being recommended ... elected... etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that gets me every time about the end is ... what was the point of Nagisa running off with Shuzumu only to wind up back with Tomoe. The one whom if she had of stuck with from the beginning, would have possibly became a Co-Elotile with her. Even though it would have seemed that Amane and Hikari were destined to win the Elotile-election.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that the Art was a 9. There were some poorly drawn background characters. But overall it was a Great Animation Style. Characters were a 10 because they were super adorable and cute, and Amane was just so  awesome! Enjoyment got a 9 because there was that whole running off with Shuzumu at the end which I think kind of felt out of place with how the story should have went. Even Amane admitted this by saying that she didn't feel like she actually won the Election. And, finally, the Overall got a 9 for being what was, for the second time around now, a Great Watch! \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a typical shoujo/yuri that explores different portrayals of love whether its jealous, superficial, friendly, or passionate in an emotional love docehedron at an all girls school. It's a classic and popular shoujo-ai/yuri type anime and please take note I don't recall a single male character in the series (Which is fine). It is not as deep as Mari-Mite as it maintains some school-age wit and a faster storyline. It follows a normal high school storyline routine however it does get quite slow in the second half of the series. It makes balance of color contrasts well and its accompanied with a coupleof violin and piano sonatas. The antagonists stand out and the characters are written so that you may feel enough sympathy so by the final episodes you wonder how the love triangles will conclude. Overall it was enjoyable to watch from beginning to end and it is best for those whom love to follow character's relationships. As a shoujo/yuri fan, the main reason I don't think it was perfect is that I figured it could have gone deeper or further in the storyline in the time that it used for the second half.",

            "content": "I'm no yuri expert by any means, but I am a sucker for romance and I will say that this show does romance fairly well. \r\nThe Story:  It's a rather complex plot which blends together several character arcs in what I would say is a more or less satisfying conclusion. I say complex because there is quite a bit of character development in the 26 episodes. There are many secrets. There are many romances. But there is a sense of progress and it rarely feels like filler. It's very character driven and for the most part, I felt myself caring about the characters. Theshow can get very dark at times, but at the same time, there is plenty of humour, romance, and lightheartedness. I've felt confused quite a few times while watching and some themes they brush upon are not very comfortable, but at the same time, there was a sense of comfort and hope. The show is earnest and quite seriously set on telling a decent romantic story if you let it. Character interactions and development were mostly well done, although some choices and situations were rather strange and did not penetrate my disbelief. Ultimately, it's a good romance story because the show convinced that me that the feelings were real and that I should care about these characters. Although it's a conclusive story, I do wish to see more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Score:  The art style is consistent and well done. It's an older show, but the style is pretty and doesn't distract. As far as the score, it's not quite up there with Clannad or Sakura Trick, but there are a couple memorable scores, and it's nice that they incorporated some music into the character development via playing the piano. We all know that pianos add +1 to romance.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nYuri/Ecchi/Lewd:  This is a bit of a mixed bag. The show isn't shy about sexual themes, but at times, it goes a little too far. There is no actual nudity, but there are definitely themes of sexual relationships between certain characters. The Yuri theme is present throughout pretty much the whole show, mostly in forms of romance. There are a few kisses, but it's not on level of Sakura Trick. Though I will say that there are a few much deserved kisses and moments of intimacy that feel like a real payoff. Simply because of the subject matter and fairly strong sexual themes, I would say that this is for mature audiences. I know it says PG13 and for the most part, it is, but those few moments make it quite questionable. I'm sure most teens can handle it, but I wouldn't be comfortable showing this to someone under 16. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for ecchi, this isn't really that great of a show for it because it's relatively scarce. If you're a fan of romance and yuri romance in particular, I think the story is compelling and ultimately worth watching. It's by no means a perfect show, but I think it's up there with Yuru Yuri and Sakura Trick in terms of Yuri because it provides something neither of those shows really do and that is deep romance.",

It is all about the drama and emotions and peoples' inability to communicate their feelings; there's very little actual kissing or nudity/implied sex.  Shizuma is supposed to be this dark, brooding heroine...but she came off to me as kind of a creepy bully who is a little fuzzy on the notion of consent.  It's still gross & rape-y, even among lesbians.  \r\nIt's not a bad show, it's just that there are two much better shows I can name that are so much betterthan this one, namely Sweet Blue Flowers and even Sakura Trick.  Sweet Blue Flowers actually delivers on everything Strawberry Panic aspires to but fails to reach.  The characters of Sakura Trick have the same innocent appeal as Nagisa of this show, but there's more genuine warmth and emotion and their love feels more real and genuine than any of the relationships in Strawberry Panic!.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, in Strawberry Panic! there's a plot driven use of temporary amnesia that's completely ridiculous, targeting a very specific set of memories from blunt force trauma to the head...which the character doesn't even go to the hospital for and which the show dialogue informs us that doctors have said the effects are only temporary (but the show doesn't show that character being examined by any doctor!); Minor nitpick but I found it to be laughably bad writing.  Another character suffers from what I jokingly call \"unspecified manga disease\" that is of course fatal.  Strawberry Panic! suffers from a number of such cliches.",

The bottom line is that this is a great anime. It's actually one of the few anime dramas I've seen, and it was quite sad at times. If you can muscle through the sad moments, you'll have a great time watching.\r\nThe only problem I had with some of the characters is that they seem more significant thenthey become while the series unfolds. For example, Chiyo, who adores Nagisa to death, seems to fall short of having any real impact on Nagisa despite the fact that Chiyo is a main character. A few other of the \"first year\" characters who are actively involved with Nagisa and Tamao also fall into this shortcoming.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a few flaws here and there, this anime builds up at a very tense pace developing relationships and characters with every single episode. Once you reach home stretch of the last 5 episodes, you'll sit there holding your breath anxiously awaiting the ending. It's worth every single episode, and in fact one of the most rewarding shows I've completed.",

You don't ever get bored. Not to mention the theme song is great too. Over all this is probably one of my favorite anime. I really have nothing bad to say.",

            "content": "Strawberry Panic is a 26 episode anime series directed by Masayuki Sakoi and from the studio madhouse who also made Claymore, Cowboy Bebob, Beck:The Mongolian Chop Squad, Chobits and Death Note. I find this series entertaining but sometimes a little dragging. The animation was ok and the art....you'll get use to it. This series may not be the one of the best that Madhouse made but still it's nice to watch. The BGM used are sometimes a bit off and you'll also get use to it. Even with some flaws strawberry panic is still fun to watch because you'll get attached to some characters. Ipity Tamao because she was the one always helping out Nagisa and she was always the one who supports her. In the end Nagisa was with Shizuma and I think Tamao was like broken hearted. Nevertheless, the ending is still good and a bit unexpected and I liked the pairing of the characters especially Shizuma and Nagisa. \\n\\n\r\nIt's my first time watching a yuri series. To those who don't know what is yuri then I'll explain it briefly. Yuri in japanese, is shojo ai or in english it's like lesbianism. Back to the series, good thing that this series doesn't have intense scenes and good thing this is not hentai or else my parents would kill me for watching it. For a yuri series it is surprising that strawberry panic doesn't have a R-15 rating like Full Metal Panic TSR. All in all this show was great I enjoyed it and &quot;kinilig&quot; ako sa story. At the end of this series it will make you crave for more maybe because i don't know what will happened afterwards especially to the characters who wasn't able to be with someone they really love and in the end has to give up. This series in neither good nor bad and it's up to you to judge it but for me I think the show is nice to watch when you have the time.\\n",

I will continue to watch this.\r\nI am however a bit disappointed in the ending. I'm not a very big fan of open endings, and even though the story's ending was very much complete, it still felt like an open ending leaving us with much unanswered questions which I would very much have liked to be answered. Also for the fact that it doesn't seem that a second season will be released or made.\r\nMy heart bleeds for Tamao who was 'left at the altar' ifI can put it in such a way. I think we all agree that Nagisa might have made a better choice staying with Tamao, BUT we also know that Shizuma and Nagisa was meant to be together. Even though Shizuma hurt Nagisa a lot of times. But we all get caught up in the past and struggle to let go of one or two things. So i don't blame Shizuma that much.\\n\\n\r\nI just found Shizuma's character very attractive, mysterious appealing (hope I am using the correct words). Makes you want to get in her mind at some stage.\\n\\n\r\nI also had a bit of a problem with the effortless victory Amane and Hikari had on becoming Etoiles. I do agree that the ending was a bit rushed and that an extra episode would have done the whole story much justice. Or at least they should have made it an extra long finale.\\n\\n\r\nIt bothers me that they left us with so many questions. I do not want to figure the rest out for myself as it would have been better to leave us with a decent ending like what will happen to Shizuma and Nagisa once Shizuma graduated, will Tamao and Nagisa still be friends in the end, will Yaya and Tsugoma get together, who will live happily ever after, will Tamao and Nagisa get a chance, what awaits Miyuki and Shizuma in the open world etc etc etc. I would have been happy with at least one or two more answers.\\n\\n\r\nI do think that Shizuma will make Nagisa very happy and they both will have a great and loving relationship even though Shizuma graduates the next year.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all I rate this 11 out of 10. It will stay my favorite anime series of all time. I do hope however that the creators eventually decide to continue with a second series and make all the fans happy.",

Even with the amount of fan service, it was really touching. Especially the ending.\r\nThe story was alright. There were a lot of parts where I just lost interest because it was quite boring. Usually the parts that don't revolve around Nagisa or Shizuma because those were in my opinion, the most favourable characters. There were many coupleswho had different problems and the plot drifted from one to another and a lot of random crap I didn't care about happened but it was still pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art work because all the characters looked gorge haha. You might think differ but that depends what your taste is but I'm so glad they didn't give the girls over larged breasts because that ruins it for me. I think the colors complimented each other and the uniforms were quite pleasurable as-well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were enjoyable. They all had different personalities and you could get attached to them easily. Not to mention they were easy to understand. They developed slowly and you could see easily who each person wanted as &quot; more then a friend &quot;, so there were no surprises.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a great series and it deserves 8/10. It was inspiring at some parts and at times it was sexual or romantic. Couldn't have asked for better.\\n",

It's also not ridiculously long, which I preferred. There are obviously a few unnecessary episodes, but they're funny enough that you probably won't mind.\r\nI like stories with large casts of likeable characters, and that's really what I remember about Strawberry Panic.Everything about it is just so sweet, I absolutely love it.

            "content": "This show has a nice story, but takes a long time to get to it. Most of this show is little funny things and going about the life of Nagisa. Once you get to the real plot you acually get excied, but then they leave it, and you wait again for more. This show has very nice characters though, and a saticfiing ending. You are very prone to like the characters and feel sorry for them when they are sad. What is a nice factar of this show is that you understand why each charater feels the way they do. The art was very goodin it's use, and the sound was nice as well. I think the best thing in this show was the use of the song the choir sings. It is used repeatedly throughout the show to give feeling. Over all this is a show worth at least one watch.",
