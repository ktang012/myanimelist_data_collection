            "content": "11eyes, in the beginning, showed potential to be a \"10\" or \"9\" grade anime. Some shows went on and grew the beard. This one, on the other hand, devolved into something else. However, this wasn't exactly a devolution into the worst of the worst.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nThe anime showed pretty strong potential to be a very good supernatural themed story. The concept was used before. This did not discourage me from watching it though. One can use mediocre concepts and turn it into gold. I first saw this aspect as gold. This view, however, devolved and the story slowly but surely turned into something else: Ascrewy and awkward one. An interesting story suddenly became VERY awkward and weird. Suddenly, it's like the other characters lost their competence and some even derailed into \"dreadful and annoying\" (I'm looking at you, Yuka.) And the rest just got... blah. I'll give it a 4 for managing to be really interesting early on.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes definitely has great art. Arts from other more complicated series cannot be compared to this one since its main focus was the \"moe\" aspect. Characters that have cute traits like big eyes and the like are found in it. Some battle scenes did look a bit awkward though. At one time, I was expecting an epic fight between two master swordsmen. It shifts to one scene. And then cue to a scene where one of them says \"She's too strong.\" and don't fight anyway. It's like they ran out of budget to make a big fight scene. That was fail. This gets 7 for being really good at what the art's supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Arrival of Tears\" by Ayane and \"Sequentia\" by Asriel are suberb themes and are actually VERY addicting. The BGM of the show, too, was great. Epic music was around. This gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are stereotypical, that's for sure. The characters were made to cater to your fetishes. This was ok, I understand. It was the point. And then IT happened. One of the main girls degraded into a sick little girl with her own sick little fantasies. And as I said earlier, suddenly most of the cast became incompetent in combat and the main guy just became central view of the show. What the heck happened? This gets a 6 for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not that good, I definitely enjoyed this show. Admittedly, it catered to me, being a moe anime after all. It's my type. Later on this interest disappeared due to... complications in story. This gets a 7 in enjoyment - it's quite entertaining to watch nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes, though deserving lots of the flak from our fellow watchers, is a pretty ok anime. It barely crosses \"5\" territory, which for me is a low score already. Overall, 11eyes cannot be considered a great or a superb anime. But undeniably the show is decent enough to stand. But if one looks for story and development in an anime, 11eyes is not for you.",

            "content": "What starts out as an interesting supernatural mystery/action romance quickly devolves into the \"I'm the main character and only useful one\" cliche with a such a feeble plot that anyone with critical thinking skills will be disgusted.  \r\nStory - 2/10\r\nThe plot is paper thin.  High school kids are randomly transported to the Red Night, a red mirror world of danger and isolation, where they must fight for survival against random threatening things and, of course, the Black Knights.  Although, it is explained later that these kids are \"special\", it is never explained why the kids, who'd lived lives of relative normalcy, aresuddenly whisked away on some random day to The Red Night.  (Must be the power of adolescence.)  \\n\\n\r\nThe big reveal of the story is as poorly implemented as it is predictable.  Instead of undermining the heroes' determination by causing confusion and guilt, there's merely a glaring dissonance between the bad guys' actions and their supposed motivations.  The bad guys' actions should have taken on new meaning and made the heroes make a choice that would forever define their characters and wrap up the themes of survival, self-sacrifice, and friendship.  However, it is handled so poorly that the Bad guys create the things they're supposedly trying to guard against.  This dissonance precludes any type of meaningful conclusion because the series has apparently run against simple logic since the very beginning, rendering the conflict irrelevant.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10 \\n\r\nThe art is fairly bland.  There's nothing particularly wrong with any of the art, but there is nothing distinctly memorable either.  The Red Night is unremarkable, merely a copy of the real world with a red tint, and the Black Knights' sanctum, if it can be called such, is never defined except for some red giant stalagmites.  The most interesting things art wise are Misuzu's swords, summoned by the power of nail-polished symbols.  (Hurray!)  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is good.  Usually unnoticeable, it does a good job setting up the atmosphere.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\r\nIn a rare stroke for the 'highschool kids save the world' genre, the main character isn't given an immediate power up.  Instead, he acts with a realistic mixture of fright, confusion, and desperation when he and his childhood friend/love interest are transported into a world that is serious about killing them.  In fact, for their first few encounters with the Red Night, they must be protected by a kick-ass female swordswoman, who's competence and prudence is the only thing that keeps them alive, as the main character trains to be able to protect himself and his girl.  \\n\\n\r\nThis characterization was the first thing that drew my attention and gave me hope that we'd see mature character development throughout the series as Kakeru worked under Misuzu's guidance to become independent and a protagonist worthy of protecting what he held dear.  Unfortunately, the main character becomes the most powerful of the heroes through a power up while the kickass female slowly loses her competence and independence for really no other reason than to make the main character look more manly and heroic be comparison.   (Did the creators want to keep the suck ratio of the group constant?)  Meanwhile, all the other characters who had their own strengths and quirks, regress to worthless, crazy, withering piles of fear and despair.  Still, this could have been salvageable, by sticking to the harsh realities of the main character's unrealistic goal of protecting innocence, but the ending made whatever tragedies happened to the characters null.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10 \\n\r\nAs someone who dislikes fanservice, this anime's constant use of panty-shots was an ever present annoyance.  The anime never missed an opportunity to take off clothes and even used the cop out of \"you must have sex to save the world\" excuse to maintain the main character's integrity even though he was getting some from a girl he obviously didn't love.  Although fanservice annoys me, I will tolerate it in anime where the plot and characters are genuinely interesting.  However, since that is not the case with 11eyes, the fanservice sticks out as another detraction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10 (Poor) \\n\r\nWhile the first episodes look promising, the anime loses all sense of itself by failing at drama and backing away from the harsh themes they set up by its poorly written plot.  You're better off looking for another supernatural series for entertainment as this one is a big disappointment.  There are plenty of better ones out there.",

            "content": "I hated this anime with a passion that can destroy cities. I am writing this review in hope to burn, char, and devour it in the forest of my mind and never have to remember it. The anime was based of an intuitive game by the creator \"feng\" of \"Akane-iro no somaru saka\" fame. If you know feng at all, you know that the anime adoptions of his games tend to suck. Suck hard. Let's begin.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story starts out typical shonen and for 10 out of 12 episodes follows a formulaic episode set-up. Walk around the real world, red night, fight scene, return toreal world, repeat. The red night is a parallel world the characters travel to and is essentially the same background with a red paint bucket and some crystals jutting out of the ground. The story is really just \"Fight the monsters\" in the red night for ten episodes until the main characters realize that the bad guys are actually the goods guys, they are the bad guys, the main girl is a retard, and that killing everyone off is a good way to end a show. It's so painful to watch this show. Then you add a sword master who wants to have sex with our \"hero\" to \"save the world.\" Just god damn it all. I literally stopped and walked around my room I was so frustrated. Why? BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE \"PLOT\" THIS SHOW SET UP.\\n\\n\r\nSorry. Let me gather myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nOkay good. The art is poor. Characters look ugly, move funny, and have weirdly disproportionate bodies. The background is lame and uninteresting. The black knights were probably the best looking things in this anime and as another reviewer said, they looked like crap. There isn't much to say. Everything looks so generic and repetitive it isn't even funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nBest part of the anime, right here. The opening was kind of cool. Not cool enough to want to listen to more than once a week but it was pretty high octane and really got you pumped to watch this show. Too bad the lead in was exactly what it was, just a lead in. The rest of the sound isn't mind-blowing. Voices are bland, nothing special. The background noises were okay, nothing stellar. The tentacle monsters sounded kind of cool though, but they were quickly hacked away or silenced by the whiny protagonist or one of his annoying friends.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nAHHHHHHHHHHHH.\\n\\n\r\nDammit. I want to meet anyone who even slightly liked any of these characters and I would like to punch them square in the face. The characters are so one-dimensional, so straight-forward, so very bad I couldn't possibly grow to like them. The lead is your usual \"profagonist\", he is a loner who is too cool for the lead girl to be with, because he lived life alone as an orphan because his sister died or something. He also wears an eye-patch because he has a yellow eye that somehow holds a 500 year old man inside of it. DUMB! The main girl suffers from severe mental retardation. I think she was supposed to be a yandere (girl who would kill others for her to be alone with her man) or so to speak but she really just comes across as a girl who gets half-naked a lot and walks around, stupidly activating all the bad guys traps, causing a shitload of drama for the main cast. The other characters include a multi-personality killer who when she takes her glasses off goes on a rampage, a loner (AGAIN?) who WAS an orphan and was taken in by the school nurse who is a biker and has amazing assets that shake when on screen to divert your attention from any kind of plot. No seriously. I think they purposely put her on screen to try and make up for plot. The best friend who is freaking annoying and has sideburns and never shuts up about making sexual innuendos that were never funny. The black knights are the saving grace, albeit they too are one-sided boring characters, the bad guys in a typical shonen are kind of supposed to be (I didn't expect very much of the bad guys and they gave me at least what I asked for). Overall freaking terrible characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI abhorred every moment I watched this show. This was not fun to watch. I kept looking at my clock hoping for it to end. The most fun I had with this show was writing this very review on it, out of the hope that someone might not watch and get their five hours of life on this planet back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI'm going to be generous and give it a four. On MAL a four means \"decent\" or \"bad\", but on my list of standards a four means \"Terrible and avoid like the plague,\" and that is exactly what you should do.\\n\\n\r\nDo not watch this anime. There is a world of better media out their to feast on, and if you will watch this, watch it out of jest with a few friends so you can throw popcorn at the screen when the characters do something stupid. You're gonna need a lot of popcorn.",

            "content": "11eyes could have been a not so bad anime if the plot was executed correctly. While it wasn't the most original, the premise wasn't half-bad either. Instead we get 12 episodes of pointless fan service, mediocre character development  and massive plot holes. \r\nStory:\r\nIt was actually hard to find a story within the first half of the show. In fact, it was nothing else than bunch of kids fighting the black knight for whatever reason. You didn't know why they were transported there and why the black knights were trying to kill them. Until you get to second half, it went down hill. I couldcomplain that the first half was confusing me more than ever since the story wasn't developing, but after the second half it was actually better to tell nothing at all. What lacks in the story is the fact that 11eyes made so many plot twists and not intelligent ones that it became embarrassing. A 12 years old could make a more interesting story than that. In the end, the story left many holes and the viewer is still as much confused, or even more, than he was at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fair to be honest. While most the characters lacked the ability to dress as something else than their school suit, they were actually distinctive. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation on the other end, was bad. What strikes me the most, is the terrible fighting choreography.While some expressions the made were plain dumb, they were at least walking correctly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIt is very sad when the sound is actually the only point that is decent for a show. No doubt about it, the opening and the ending theme song was enjoyable. There's just a few annoying voice acting, most notably the girls cast, but the viewer can easily get over it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin? Beside the fact that they were mostly cardboards, retards and that the protagonist is lame, there's nothing more to say. The characters were fair at the beginning of the show. While there are few complaints, they were at least interesting. Somehow, the producer thought it would have been a good idea to add a bit(or too much) dementia in the character development. This is where everything gets embarrassing and everything goes down hill. What I hate the most is that you can't say which is more retard between Yuka and Kakeru. Yuka is a lame yandere and a dumb blonde(even is she's not blonde) and Kakeru is just lame, retard and ignorant. The three other main characters aren't better either. Yukiko is just plainly annoying, Misuzu is a slut with no soul and Takahisa is your typical hot head guy. It is funny to see a stereotyped cast, but it's even funnier to see a stereotype cast trying to act in drama situations. I find it very very very sad the best characters were actually the ones that were just there for fillers. Yes I'm talking about Saiko.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this show, while it wasn't that painful, the story didn't make any sense and the characters are quite lame. Not to mention that they actually inserted fan service in scenes where it was supposed to be sad, or at least emotional. 11eyes is badly executed and is perhaps among the worst anime of 2009.",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations, in my experience, tend to range from very good to very bad. 11eyes has done the impossible and achieved both at once. \r\nHaving just finished the last episode, I have to say, it looks like the animators just ran out of time when they were trying to complete the show, but still had about 30% of the game's text to cover in a mere 22 minutes. \r\nSo, \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt's not a unique storyline. Boy and friends get pulled into parallel universe where they fight various monsters for an unknown objective. It's been done before, but was much better in Final Fantasy TacticsAdvance. Especially in the last few episodes, the show tends to mention things casually as though they were the most natural thing ever:\\n\r\n   'You can travel through space-time?'\\n\r\n   'Yes.'\\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, playing the game in order to get the 'full experience' of the storyline might be a better option than watching the show. That being said, there's no English patch for the game, so yeah...\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10 \\n\r\nAnimation-wise, 11eyes was consistently good. It looked clean and attractive, even on QUALITY 480p video. My one complaint about the art is that the hoard of 'Black Knights', while decent designs, had literally no detail. It was like watching flat-texture enemies. Which frankly sucked. Otherwise, it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nOne of the things that really caught me by surprise was the sound in this show. Quite often, there are dissonant ringing sounds or booming noises that just catch your attention, because they're loud and awesome sounding, much like watching a movie in a theater when the sound is loud enough to make the room shake. Lost a point because sometimes when it was that loud, the sound actually got distorted, which could just be the quality of the videos I was watching, but meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6/10\\n\r\nI never learned any characters names other than the two main characters. They're basically the same archetypes in every popular show but with different hair and eye color. There's the kuudere sword girl, dandere mysterious magician, token annoying perverted friend and the included random girl that beats him up, happy-lovey naive main girl, yandere girl with a scary dark past, main guy who is 'stupid and reckless but has a kind heart', etc etc. Same old. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10\\n\r\nThis show did catch me by surprise at some times. At those times, I said 'Hey, this is great'. Until the last episode, when everything was rushed, glossed over, and never properly concluded. There is going to be an OVA in the summer, but it seems like it will have different content, since apparently the main storyline is over. I'm hoping it takes some time to explain some of the 'casually mentioned in conversation' things such as time-space travel, Abraxas the spirit, and other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nGood but stale.",

First, let's start with the good. The character designs are pretty nice especially the \"black knights\" and the artwork and fighting scenes are done well. \r\nNow the bad. It's hard to like an anime when the main protagonists annoy you. It's also annoying when every sentence that comes out of the main character's mouth is \"protect Yuka, Yuka this, Yuka that\" or \"Where's Kakeru, Kakeru this Kakeru that.\" Kakeru and Yuka's relationship destroyseverything that's good about the series and by the end, you wish the whole world gets destroyed along with the writers of this story as well.",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nI at first enjoyed the storyline, about the first two to four episodes. I found the story to rather draw me in, because I wanted to know the secret of the ulter dimension. However, as details began to be revealed, I got to be rather disgruntled  with the whole thing. It seemed rather rushed, and something that should have been spread out to something much longer. I was also left with a sour feeling in my stomach, as I rather didn't like the ending.\r\nArt: 7\r\nThe art starts of phenominal. This wass something that had drawn me in, the beautiful details, the colors. Ifound that to be rather impressive. What I didn't find to be impressive was the fact that the animation really did begin to slack off as it got closer to the end of the anime. It seemed some sections got more time spent on them then others, and the movement that I had seen in the first few episodes, just wasn't there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED the sounds. This was one of the things that seemed to almost stick through to the very end of the whole anime, but not quite.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I rather didn't like Yuka. As her personality developed, she became more self centered about her relationship with Kakeru, and forgot her other friends, which has a rather negative effect in the end. She can really be blamed for a lot of the problems that happen later on. There was also the fact that my very favorite characters rather got sidelined towards the end, or completly cut out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI started of enjoying it, but then I started enjoying being mad at the story creators and the storyline, and what happened to the characters. Shure, it is a really good, twisted storyline, but it is one of those that I wasn't happy with the ending. There are others that end happy, with a sad note, but this one rather takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nWatch 11eyes with a precautinary note. As much as there was that I liked about the anime, there was equally as muh that drove me nuts about it.",

            "content": "Save yourself the time and don't bother with this one.  While I can't call it the worst anime I've seen, 11 Eyes certainly has to be up there on that list.  The idea behind it isn't actually bad at all, but the way it was done and really pretty much everything about this anime was just plain awful.\r\n11 Eyes is about a guy named Kakeru and a group of high schoolers that have powers and go into this parallel universe-type thing they call Red Night randomly every once in a while and while there are attacked by the Black Knights.  The waythe first episode or two goes, you think that this might be worth something eventually and keep watching.  Sure, they're moving this story at an impossible pace and I wonder if they can explain everything they need to by the time 12 episodes is up, but there really is some decent potential there.  That's a mistake.  It gets worse.  Generally in this one, you'll be sitting there going \"what the hell just happened and why,\" and ten minutes later when about a tenth of it is explained you go \"Oh, I see.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What about the other 900 questions I had?\"  And no, none of them will be answered.\\n\\n\r\nI call this the \"answer one question in a flashy way so hopefully the viewers forget about all the plotholes there are and enjoy the show\" plot.  It's rather ingenious really.  And it happens in a lot of anime, but there's a real showcase here.  Not of them succeeding in diverting your attention, but in that they really don't answer hardly any questions.  Sometimes a character will realize what's going on and you can see the lightbulb going off in their head, but no one actually says what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music is dark and ominous, but reminds me of a title track in a game that repeats itself over and over again.  It gets kind of annoying after a while as there is no variety at all and even what they give you is nothing to write home about.  I don't think the opening and endings were awful but I've already forgotten them, so they couldn't have been that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.  HA!  Where should I go with this.  The characters were pretty awful.  When you meet Kakeru at the beginning you probably feel a mixture of pity and annoyance.  He's obviously been shafted his entire life, and that really sucks.  But the way he just wants to avoid contact with anyone other than Yuka, who I guess would be considered the female lead, is pretty annoying.  And most of all, between the character design, the voice, and the way he acts most of the time, he really seems like a (very) bad copy of Lelouch Lamperouge.  Yuka is hard to deal with as well, as she is obviously in love with Kakeru and EVERYONE knows it.  And she pretty much knows everyone knows it, and just wants to spend all time forever with him.  She grew up with Kakeru and his sister, who killed herself when they were kids, in an orphanage.  She was adopted and Kakeru went to live by himself, but they stayed together.  Cute right?  Not so much in this case.  As the show goes on you can tell that she actually is pretty demented.  If anyone else comes close to Kakeru she snaps.  It would be disturbing, but they way they did it made it just seem laughable.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that play major parts.  But don't worry about them.  If you decide to try and watch this show they're all easy to understand.  And Kusakabe actually isn't that bad of a character.  A little to serious all the time, but overall I'd actually give her passing marks as a character.\\n\\n\r\nNext about the enjoyment.  Watching this show because it seems intriguing is kind of like sticking your head in a mulcher because you wonder what it would feel like.  It's just not a good idea.  After the first couple episodes there's actually enough excitement(because of the potential) that you want to watch a little more.  Even then there's not a whole lot of enjoyment.  It's still more like \"it might get better, it might get better.\"  But it just never does.  And even before the end of the show you're left with a vague feeling of disappointment that you watched this show so far and that it really didn't get better, but in fact continued to get worse.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I have forgotten to mention yet is the art.  The animation is actually not bad, and the action scenes are pretty decent.  The art style is also one that I usually enjoy as well.  I put art off until now so I could talk about the ecchi parts of the show.  Random winds that flip up girls skirts, Yuka wearing nothing but her underwear trying to come on to Kakeru, and clothes getting torn to shreads to reveal a little skin.  Yes, there is a fair amount of ecchi scenes in the anime.  But the way they were done were simply awful.  Most of these ecchi parts are completely unnecessary and in fact detract from the already painfully bad story.  They way they were done was always bad timing and in bad taste.  I usually like some ecchi here and there, but the way they did it here just made it seem inappropriate.  I'm sure they meant for you to think Yuka is losing it when she strips down on someone's front porch to try to get close to Kakeru, but it just seems wrong even for that.  Having said all that, in truth the art and animation of the show is one point that you can say gets a decent grade.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude all of this, I must say once again, don't bother with this show.  It takes a somewhat promising story and decent art and drives it into the ground.  11 Eyes is not a good anime.  I feel like I wasted time watching it, and it's bad enough that I almost feel like I'm wasting time writing this review.  But, maybe someone will read this and decide not to watch the show or at least stop after a couple episodes and not hope, like I did that it will get better.  Overall, I give this one a 4.",

Don't even watch episode 12, if you do that than this show is 10x better.\r\nReview: Show is based off a game so I didn't set my expectations too high going in. The beginning of the show starts off with typical anime high school drama and supernatural junk but half way through the show things start picking up and I was pleasantly surprised at some of the darker and more gruesome issues and incidents that get brought up. One of the scenes in theshow actually made me do a mental cringe at the gruesomeness of the scene(mostly because I didn't expect anything like that at all to happen in this show). Unfortunately the show leads you on in thinking that this is where the show is headed and I began to fall for this show thinking that the ending was going to be a dark and gruesome ending(which are the best endings in my opinion). Oh but how wrong I was to assume that. The last half of the 11th episode had me going like \"WTF? is this?\" and than the 12th episode proceeded to respond to that question with a bitch slap to my intellect... \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes you think that it's one of those rare gems you find in a bunch of cliche and typical anime, but than at the last second the writers polished off the gleam of the gem and all you find yourself left with is a dried up piece of bullshit...\\n\\n\r\nRant(Spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nI haven't played the game that this show is based off of but still, come on writers!! Unwrap those tentacles from around your brains, like literally the Misuzu and Kakeru fuck scene was an insult... Like here I am thinking to myself, did I just watch 10 episodes of an elaborate setup for a hentai... Heck at that point I would've actually appreciated the show more if it did become a hentai scene, but no the writers decided to be like well now that your turned on... Time travelling boner killing plot twist time!!!! GG no re...",

Yes she can be really annoying but there is a reason for it.And there are other character as well which are really well developed.Misuzu,Yukiko,Takahisa,Shiori and the rest of the cast are great characters!And I never understoud why everyone focuses only on Yuka.There are many more characters other than Kakeru and Yuka Bakas!\\n\\n\r\n    ENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\n   Every story ark,every blatle,every dialogue was never boring.And the development of the story was very strong especially the last spech!And even thoughthe ending was not really epic I didn't care,because I wanted those characters to get out of the red night!Een when it was fanservisy I didn't care because of the power of the story!!!\\n\\n\r\n    so OVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nAnd a word of andice,don't let Yuka destroy your reception about this anime and don't have any expectations before you watch ior else you will get disapointed.",

Also, as the monologues don\u2019t suit on the situation either on the story, this becomes an exchange of bland thoughts that gives either fluster or total denial on continuing this series. \\n\\n\r\nWith its failure due to its story, there might be a couple or few to be entertained on. One, it contains a fighting scenes that is quite interesting due that it composed of characters that have different abilities and artwork to polish each of its scenes, yet it might be as common for the others to say as it doesn\u2019t stands out to be different or unique. Second, with the help of the music and background sounds it emphasizes the movement and flow of each scene, characters, and effects throughout the show. Lastly, it\u2019s the only thing that this series greatly posses which brings different emotions, CHARACTERS! which is some of them are common, funny, silly, and a source of fan service (just being sarcastic on these, but it\u2019s quite true) that might be the asset of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, my first impression is\u2026 speechless. Cannot describe with just words but can conclude that it is a bunch of lame, stereotype, and somehow non-entertaining due to its foolish actions. I\u2019ll say that the other side (enemies) is much better than most of the leading/non-leading characters, but sadly to say, the series just contains a little amount of episodes that will focus more to the abilities of the enemies or maybe to improve the character development. On its way be glad to see some of the leading/non-leading character that puts effort on giving just a little up to big amount of excitement and thrill. Overall, it\u2019s not good neither bad but don\u2019t expect to see some amazingly different from the characters as they move throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nObviously I can\u2019t understand on what elements they\u2019re trying to focus on this series. It seems that because it contains few episodes they convey on and didn\u2019t manage to emphasize the story itself but rather they add some random scenes just to fill it out, However, these kind of scenes didn\u2019t manage to give anything significant to the show rather it\u2019s full of idiocy that brings disappointment as an overall.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s recommendable with all of its \u2018amazing crap\u2019 aspects. If you are curious about it, just try it out and enter the world of foolishness. As soon as you \u2018finish\u2019 the 12 episodes you may consider yourself lucky to be out to that world. As for me I\u2019m just curious on how the ending went but sadly to say it\u2019s still the same as where I started.",

            "content": "Before I watched 11 eyes I did my research and almost every review said that it  was a total let down. Well I stepped up to the challenge and started watching 11 eyes. At first I was like \"WHAT! why did everyone say this was bad\"? Then halfway through I realized what went wrong...the characters.\r\nStory 7\r\nIm rating it a 7 based on the actuall story and not how it was made. It was quite intersting I mean it revolves around Kakeru Satsuki the leading male and Yuka Minase, childhood friends who are dragged into a mysterious world named \"red night\". In this world thereare cratures and powerfull beings that wish to desroy these 'fragments'. Finding out they are not the only humans they forge alliances in red night and in the real wold. Each person has a secret power which is slowly discoverd through surviving red night. Now if a better company produced 11eyes and kept it on track then i believe it would deserve an 8 but allas...\\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nBeing released in 2009 the animation is still considered quite good. The backgrounds and the lighting used improve the visual experience. Characters look quite good also nothing you would think is 'old'.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nThe opeing song Arrival of Tears is one that I enjoyed it is a rock style with a sprinkle of mystery in the tune. It builds you up and gets you ready for the action in 11 eyes. The ending is one of my favourite ending songs \"sequetia\" is also a rock syled but is more energetic and is fitting for the end. The video for Sequetia is very good be sure to check it out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5\\n\r\nThis I believe is the biggest downfall for 11 eyes. Its not all the characters that are annoying but some change drastically from being loved to thinking \"just DIE already!!\" Youll know what im talking about if you watch the anime. The development was a tad bit slow and even at the end they all go back to normal as if nothing ever changed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5\\n\r\nI have to say once i started this anime i was convinced it was going to be a good action anime that i would remember. But now i just think of it as something my brother suggested to me when i was bored (not listening to him again lol). It just barely tweaked my interest and just when you think things are going good it all comes crashing down again. I might sound a bit too harsh but there are postives in 11 eyes such as the action. The fightings scenes were well done its fluid and moves link with one another, not the best I have seen but still good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\r\nNot one that i would suggeest to anyone unless I knew this was there thing. Be prepared to get annoyed, although I know people that have enjoyed it.\\n\r\n If you are into action, liked school days (you will know why ;P) and watch anime for the music then 11 eyes would suit you :D.\\n\r\nbtw this is my 2nd review (forgot to say it was my 1st on my 1st which was MM!) and I would appreciate and constructive critisims :D.",

            "content": "Well 11eyes was a big surprise. To be honest just before starting watching it i was critical. The storyline seemed so unorigional and i only watched it becuase i needed something to pass the time and for some unknown reason this kept bugging me for quite some time so i decided to finally watch it.\r\nIt was nothing like i thought. Firstly although the whole idea of another world with chosen warriors with special ability's to fight and defend their world has been majorly over used,i realised straight away this wasn't your regular \"other world\" story. The only unorigional thing i found about the anime wasthe characters, they were simple characters, stereotypes even of typical anime characters:\\n\\n\r\nKakeru- the wannabe knight, pushing himself to be better, fighting for the love of his life\\n\r\nYuka- Typical big breasted cute, naive girl, who lets her heart rule her (although she does have a very nice unexpected turn around later on)Lots of panty shots. (you know what i dont get anime girls never seem to change their undies)\\n\r\nMisuzu- Serious, mysterious, takes no crap from anybody, proud older girl\\n\r\nYukiko- (my favourite character; though that may be cause she looks like me and im cosplaying her :P) Petite, bubbly, happy-go-lucky, glass half full, and very into groping i might add (haha she acts like me too)\\n\r\nTakahisa- the bad man! tough guy, street wise with a sad backstory\\n\\n\r\nthe only unorigional character in this was Kukuri the mute girl\\n\\n\r\n11eyes grabs you at the first episode, the relationship between Yuka and Kakeru (if annoying) is endearing and the slow intorduction of different characters is easy going. I loved the fight scenes (and in my opinion Yukiko kicks serious a*s*e lol but i am slightly bias due to my love of her) and the way the relationship between the main characters gets so deep and close \"for friends and for tommorow\" and then is totally ripped apart mainly due to the jealousy due to a certain some one; i wont name names *cough* Yuka *Cough getting a love rival *cough*Misuzu*cough*\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing i hate about 11eyes is that it concentrated too much on Kakeru and Yuka's relationship. If you ask me (and anyone with sense) Yukiko and Takahisa seemed much more in love and their relationship was much more interesting and the spin on their story is so sad and origional it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I think the only improvement could have been to look more at the other characters in detail beside Kakeru, Yuka and Misuzu\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is somewhat confusing and might i mention not what anyone expected, if your planning on watching this my advice is expect the unexpected because this is not your typical bright and happy ending nonsense this is dark stuff dude that is masquerading as something cute and happy.\\n\\n\r\n11eyes is definately worth a try if your into surprises but i have a feeling its the anime version of marmite; you either love it or you hate it (i love it...though i hate marmite) But luckily you can tell whether you love or hate it within the first episode so its worth a try no matter what. \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah not for kids may seem innocent and sweet but later it gets a little bit more mature (scenes of a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slight sexual nature)\\n\\n\r\nPeace and love people \\n\\n\r\nPic-n-mix :)",

You watch thinking of something will be explorated in the plot, but this doesnt happen. The animeis summarized in the following, they enter the black moon after they leave, they enter again and then leave again, nothing makes sense, comes with the story that they are \"fragments\" but nothing is explained, at the beginning of the anime showing something cute but with the passing of the anime suddenly it comes down to killing and blood, containing even scenes of torture, and you actually think, WHAT FUCK IS THAT? The studio and the author had everything to make a story in the least reasonable but the anime is a crap, sometimes something cool happen but in general it's hard to watch, and more hard to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is actually the best of the anime, The art is very well made and pleasurable to see, besides the characters are beautiful, in fact they are half cliches and half generics but they are very beautiful at all\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, Contains some interesting soundtracks, actually this part of the anime i liked, leaves the anime less bad...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For me this is the worst part in the anime, The characters are all cliches, and almost all are very boring, I think only two characters can be considered good, Takahisa Tajima the gray-haired guy and the girl with glasses, the protagonist is very poorly done, it looks like it will get strong But it never stays, you watch the anime with the hope that it will be powerful with that story from his eye, but he never stays and in the anime you all feel very angry at him, and your friend yuka is the other bad character made for me The worst of the anime, she does not add the work to anything and only appears to cause disgrace, with scenes in which with her jealousy do bad things happen, it is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I do not like it at all and if you want to watch with high expectations, give up, just as I will frustrate you, but for being a short anime, I will not say, do not watch in any way, I say instead you can watch, because In the end you can add another anime to your account ...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Being very good with the anime, I will give a 4, believe it doesnt deserve even a 4, the anime is weak and how many animes that exist is more a work cliche and failed.   \\n",

            "content": "11eyes, in the beginning, showed potential to be a \"10\" or \"9\" grade anime. Some shows went on and grew the beard. This one, on the other hand, devolved into something else. However, this wasn't exactly a devolution into the worst of the worst.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nThe anime showed pretty strong potential to be a very good supernatural themed story. The concept was used before. This did not discourage me from watching it though. One can use mediocre concepts and turn it into gold. I first saw this aspect as gold. This view, however, devolved and the story slowly but surely turned into something else: Ascrewy and awkward one. An interesting story suddenly became VERY awkward and weird. Suddenly, it's like the other characters lost their competence and some even derailed into \"dreadful and annoying\" (I'm looking at you, Yuka.) And the rest just got... blah. I'll give it a 4 for managing to be really interesting early on.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes definitely has great art. Arts from other more complicated series cannot be compared to this one since its main focus was the \"moe\" aspect. Characters that have cute traits like big eyes and the like are found in it. Some battle scenes did look a bit awkward though. At one time, I was expecting an epic fight between two master swordsmen. It shifts to one scene. And then cue to a scene where one of them says \"She's too strong.\" and don't fight anyway. It's like they ran out of budget to make a big fight scene. That was fail. This gets 7 for being really good at what the art's supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Arrival of Tears\" by Ayane and \"Sequentia\" by Asriel are suberb themes and are actually VERY addicting. The BGM of the show, too, was great. Epic music was around. This gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are stereotypical, that's for sure. The characters were made to cater to your fetishes. This was ok, I understand. It was the point. And then IT happened. One of the main girls degraded into a sick little girl with her own sick little fantasies. And as I said earlier, suddenly most of the cast became incompetent in combat and the main guy just became central view of the show. What the heck happened? This gets a 6 for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not that good, I definitely enjoyed this show. Admittedly, it catered to me, being a moe anime after all. It's my type. Later on this interest disappeared due to... complications in story. This gets a 7 in enjoyment - it's quite entertaining to watch nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes, though deserving lots of the flak from our fellow watchers, is a pretty ok anime. It barely crosses \"5\" territory, which for me is a low score already. Overall, 11eyes cannot be considered a great or a superb anime. But undeniably the show is decent enough to stand. But if one looks for story and development in an anime, 11eyes is not for you.",

            "content": "What starts out as an interesting supernatural mystery/action romance quickly devolves into the \"I'm the main character and only useful one\" cliche with a such a feeble plot that anyone with critical thinking skills will be disgusted.  \r\nStory - 2/10\r\nThe plot is paper thin.  High school kids are randomly transported to the Red Night, a red mirror world of danger and isolation, where they must fight for survival against random threatening things and, of course, the Black Knights.  Although, it is explained later that these kids are \"special\", it is never explained why the kids, who'd lived lives of relative normalcy, aresuddenly whisked away on some random day to The Red Night.  (Must be the power of adolescence.)  \\n\\n\r\nThe big reveal of the story is as poorly implemented as it is predictable.  Instead of undermining the heroes' determination by causing confusion and guilt, there's merely a glaring dissonance between the bad guys' actions and their supposed motivations.  The bad guys' actions should have taken on new meaning and made the heroes make a choice that would forever define their characters and wrap up the themes of survival, self-sacrifice, and friendship.  However, it is handled so poorly that the Bad guys create the things they're supposedly trying to guard against.  This dissonance precludes any type of meaningful conclusion because the series has apparently run against simple logic since the very beginning, rendering the conflict irrelevant.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10 \\n\r\nThe art is fairly bland.  There's nothing particularly wrong with any of the art, but there is nothing distinctly memorable either.  The Red Night is unremarkable, merely a copy of the real world with a red tint, and the Black Knights' sanctum, if it can be called such, is never defined except for some red giant stalagmites.  The most interesting things art wise are Misuzu's swords, summoned by the power of nail-polished symbols.  (Hurray!)  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is good.  Usually unnoticeable, it does a good job setting up the atmosphere.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\r\nIn a rare stroke for the 'highschool kids save the world' genre, the main character isn't given an immediate power up.  Instead, he acts with a realistic mixture of fright, confusion, and desperation when he and his childhood friend/love interest are transported into a world that is serious about killing them.  In fact, for their first few encounters with the Red Night, they must be protected by a kick-ass female swordswoman, who's competence and prudence is the only thing that keeps them alive, as the main character trains to be able to protect himself and his girl.  \\n\\n\r\nThis characterization was the first thing that drew my attention and gave me hope that we'd see mature character development throughout the series as Kakeru worked under Misuzu's guidance to become independent and a protagonist worthy of protecting what he held dear.  Unfortunately, the main character becomes the most powerful of the heroes through a power up while the kickass female slowly loses her competence and independence for really no other reason than to make the main character look more manly and heroic be comparison.   (Did the creators want to keep the suck ratio of the group constant?)  Meanwhile, all the other characters who had their own strengths and quirks, regress to worthless, crazy, withering piles of fear and despair.  Still, this could have been salvageable, by sticking to the harsh realities of the main character's unrealistic goal of protecting innocence, but the ending made whatever tragedies happened to the characters null.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10 \\n\r\nAs someone who dislikes fanservice, this anime's constant use of panty-shots was an ever present annoyance.  The anime never missed an opportunity to take off clothes and even used the cop out of \"you must have sex to save the world\" excuse to maintain the main character's integrity even though he was getting some from a girl he obviously didn't love.  Although fanservice annoys me, I will tolerate it in anime where the plot and characters are genuinely interesting.  However, since that is not the case with 11eyes, the fanservice sticks out as another detraction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10 (Poor) \\n\r\nWhile the first episodes look promising, the anime loses all sense of itself by failing at drama and backing away from the harsh themes they set up by its poorly written plot.  You're better off looking for another supernatural series for entertainment as this one is a big disappointment.  There are plenty of better ones out there.",

            "content": "I hated this anime with a passion that can destroy cities. I am writing this review in hope to burn, char, and devour it in the forest of my mind and never have to remember it. The anime was based of an intuitive game by the creator \"feng\" of \"Akane-iro no somaru saka\" fame. If you know feng at all, you know that the anime adoptions of his games tend to suck. Suck hard. Let's begin.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story starts out typical shonen and for 10 out of 12 episodes follows a formulaic episode set-up. Walk around the real world, red night, fight scene, return toreal world, repeat. The red night is a parallel world the characters travel to and is essentially the same background with a red paint bucket and some crystals jutting out of the ground. The story is really just \"Fight the monsters\" in the red night for ten episodes until the main characters realize that the bad guys are actually the goods guys, they are the bad guys, the main girl is a retard, and that killing everyone off is a good way to end a show. It's so painful to watch this show. Then you add a sword master who wants to have sex with our \"hero\" to \"save the world.\" Just god damn it all. I literally stopped and walked around my room I was so frustrated. Why? BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE \"PLOT\" THIS SHOW SET UP.\\n\\n\r\nSorry. Let me gather myself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nOkay good. The art is poor. Characters look ugly, move funny, and have weirdly disproportionate bodies. The background is lame and uninteresting. The black knights were probably the best looking things in this anime and as another reviewer said, they looked like crap. There isn't much to say. Everything looks so generic and repetitive it isn't even funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nBest part of the anime, right here. The opening was kind of cool. Not cool enough to want to listen to more than once a week but it was pretty high octane and really got you pumped to watch this show. Too bad the lead in was exactly what it was, just a lead in. The rest of the sound isn't mind-blowing. Voices are bland, nothing special. The background noises were okay, nothing stellar. The tentacle monsters sounded kind of cool though, but they were quickly hacked away or silenced by the whiny protagonist or one of his annoying friends.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nAHHHHHHHHHHHH.\\n\\n\r\nDammit. I want to meet anyone who even slightly liked any of these characters and I would like to punch them square in the face. The characters are so one-dimensional, so straight-forward, so very bad I couldn't possibly grow to like them. The lead is your usual \"profagonist\", he is a loner who is too cool for the lead girl to be with, because he lived life alone as an orphan because his sister died or something. He also wears an eye-patch because he has a yellow eye that somehow holds a 500 year old man inside of it. DUMB! The main girl suffers from severe mental retardation. I think she was supposed to be a yandere (girl who would kill others for her to be alone with her man) or so to speak but she really just comes across as a girl who gets half-naked a lot and walks around, stupidly activating all the bad guys traps, causing a shitload of drama for the main cast. The other characters include a multi-personality killer who when she takes her glasses off goes on a rampage, a loner (AGAIN?) who WAS an orphan and was taken in by the school nurse who is a biker and has amazing assets that shake when on screen to divert your attention from any kind of plot. No seriously. I think they purposely put her on screen to try and make up for plot. The best friend who is freaking annoying and has sideburns and never shuts up about making sexual innuendos that were never funny. The black knights are the saving grace, albeit they too are one-sided boring characters, the bad guys in a typical shonen are kind of supposed to be (I didn't expect very much of the bad guys and they gave me at least what I asked for). Overall freaking terrible characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI abhorred every moment I watched this show. This was not fun to watch. I kept looking at my clock hoping for it to end. The most fun I had with this show was writing this very review on it, out of the hope that someone might not watch and get their five hours of life on this planet back.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI'm going to be generous and give it a four. On MAL a four means \"decent\" or \"bad\", but on my list of standards a four means \"Terrible and avoid like the plague,\" and that is exactly what you should do.\\n\\n\r\nDo not watch this anime. There is a world of better media out their to feast on, and if you will watch this, watch it out of jest with a few friends so you can throw popcorn at the screen when the characters do something stupid. You're gonna need a lot of popcorn.",

            "content": "11eyes could have been a not so bad anime if the plot was executed correctly. While it wasn't the most original, the premise wasn't half-bad either. Instead we get 12 episodes of pointless fan service, mediocre character development  and massive plot holes. \r\nStory:\r\nIt was actually hard to find a story within the first half of the show. In fact, it was nothing else than bunch of kids fighting the black knight for whatever reason. You didn't know why they were transported there and why the black knights were trying to kill them. Until you get to second half, it went down hill. I couldcomplain that the first half was confusing me more than ever since the story wasn't developing, but after the second half it was actually better to tell nothing at all. What lacks in the story is the fact that 11eyes made so many plot twists and not intelligent ones that it became embarrassing. A 12 years old could make a more interesting story than that. In the end, the story left many holes and the viewer is still as much confused, or even more, than he was at the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fair to be honest. While most the characters lacked the ability to dress as something else than their school suit, they were actually distinctive. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation on the other end, was bad. What strikes me the most, is the terrible fighting choreography.While some expressions the made were plain dumb, they were at least walking correctly.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nIt is very sad when the sound is actually the only point that is decent for a show. No doubt about it, the opening and the ending theme song was enjoyable. There's just a few annoying voice acting, most notably the girls cast, but the viewer can easily get over it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin? Beside the fact that they were mostly cardboards, retards and that the protagonist is lame, there's nothing more to say. The characters were fair at the beginning of the show. While there are few complaints, they were at least interesting. Somehow, the producer thought it would have been a good idea to add a bit(or too much) dementia in the character development. This is where everything gets embarrassing and everything goes down hill. What I hate the most is that you can't say which is more retard between Yuka and Kakeru. Yuka is a lame yandere and a dumb blonde(even is she's not blonde) and Kakeru is just lame, retard and ignorant. The three other main characters aren't better either. Yukiko is just plainly annoying, Misuzu is a slut with no soul and Takahisa is your typical hot head guy. It is funny to see a stereotyped cast, but it's even funnier to see a stereotype cast trying to act in drama situations. I find it very very very sad the best characters were actually the ones that were just there for fillers. Yes I'm talking about Saiko.\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this show, while it wasn't that painful, the story didn't make any sense and the characters are quite lame. Not to mention that they actually inserted fan service in scenes where it was supposed to be sad, or at least emotional. 11eyes is badly executed and is perhaps among the worst anime of 2009.",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations, in my experience, tend to range from very good to very bad. 11eyes has done the impossible and achieved both at once. \r\nHaving just finished the last episode, I have to say, it looks like the animators just ran out of time when they were trying to complete the show, but still had about 30% of the game's text to cover in a mere 22 minutes. \r\nSo, \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt's not a unique storyline. Boy and friends get pulled into parallel universe where they fight various monsters for an unknown objective. It's been done before, but was much better in Final Fantasy TacticsAdvance. Especially in the last few episodes, the show tends to mention things casually as though they were the most natural thing ever:\\n\r\n   'You can travel through space-time?'\\n\r\n   'Yes.'\\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, playing the game in order to get the 'full experience' of the storyline might be a better option than watching the show. That being said, there's no English patch for the game, so yeah...\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10 \\n\r\nAnimation-wise, 11eyes was consistently good. It looked clean and attractive, even on QUALITY 480p video. My one complaint about the art is that the hoard of 'Black Knights', while decent designs, had literally no detail. It was like watching flat-texture enemies. Which frankly sucked. Otherwise, it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nOne of the things that really caught me by surprise was the sound in this show. Quite often, there are dissonant ringing sounds or booming noises that just catch your attention, because they're loud and awesome sounding, much like watching a movie in a theater when the sound is loud enough to make the room shake. Lost a point because sometimes when it was that loud, the sound actually got distorted, which could just be the quality of the videos I was watching, but meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6/10\\n\r\nI never learned any characters names other than the two main characters. They're basically the same archetypes in every popular show but with different hair and eye color. There's the kuudere sword girl, dandere mysterious magician, token annoying perverted friend and the included random girl that beats him up, happy-lovey naive main girl, yandere girl with a scary dark past, main guy who is 'stupid and reckless but has a kind heart', etc etc. Same old. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10\\n\r\nThis show did catch me by surprise at some times. At those times, I said 'Hey, this is great'. Until the last episode, when everything was rushed, glossed over, and never properly concluded. There is going to be an OVA in the summer, but it seems like it will have different content, since apparently the main storyline is over. I'm hoping it takes some time to explain some of the 'casually mentioned in conversation' things such as time-space travel, Abraxas the spirit, and other things I won't mention to avoid spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nGood but stale.",

            "content": "Story: 6\r\nI at first enjoyed the storyline, about the first two to four episodes. I found the story to rather draw me in, because I wanted to know the secret of the ulter dimension. However, as details began to be revealed, I got to be rather disgruntled  with the whole thing. It seemed rather rushed, and something that should have been spread out to something much longer. I was also left with a sour feeling in my stomach, as I rather didn't like the ending.\r\nArt: 7\r\nThe art starts of phenominal. This wass something that had drawn me in, the beautiful details, the colors. Ifound that to be rather impressive. What I didn't find to be impressive was the fact that the animation really did begin to slack off as it got closer to the end of the anime. It seemed some sections got more time spent on them then others, and the movement that I had seen in the first few episodes, just wasn't there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED the sounds. This was one of the things that seemed to almost stick through to the very end of the whole anime, but not quite.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, I rather didn't like Yuka. As her personality developed, she became more self centered about her relationship with Kakeru, and forgot her other friends, which has a rather negative effect in the end. She can really be blamed for a lot of the problems that happen later on. There was also the fact that my very favorite characters rather got sidelined towards the end, or completly cut out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nI started of enjoying it, but then I started enjoying being mad at the story creators and the storyline, and what happened to the characters. Shure, it is a really good, twisted storyline, but it is one of those that I wasn't happy with the ending. There are others that end happy, with a sad note, but this one rather takes the cake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nWatch 11eyes with a precautinary note. As much as there was that I liked about the anime, there was equally as muh that drove me nuts about it.",

Is my first time when I saw a supernatural anime type...But if all anime's are like this one...I might love this type.\r\nStory.\r\nFor me is the first time when I see this type of plot so I can't say others anime had this or not....but one thing is for certain...It had a unique plot and a very interesting one If I may say....The thing with the \"red night\" sending some kids into a paralel world with monsters and of course black knights made me wonder if that could happen in real life too [yeahhh I'm crazy nyaa~ ^_^ -]...As the story advances the plot's gettingmore and more interesting...showing us the past of that witch \"Witch of Babilon was it? -] , and the past of Velad too...all was mixed smooth and nicely done...I was a bit puzzled with the \"different worlds\" thing and \"6 type of shards sealed in a world\" but happy me I managed to understand....\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nBeautifully well done and some outstanding landscapes...the part with the black moon coming to that big building was plain awesome!\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThis part kindda disapointed me....for such a nice anime it could add better OP and ED...I listened to both of these...I really tried...but I didn't like it very much...there are really bad anime's with awesome songs and OP/ED...why did this jewell had to have such a booring OP/ED ?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nNicely drawn character with unique traits.But to be honest I hate'd Yuka's development...she became at a point of the anime WAY  to obsesed with Kakeru...So from the admiration I got for her at the first episodes transformed into rage and hate for her stupidity and obsesion over Kakeru.My favourite was the red haired swordsman....Misuzu...in my opinion she is a better match for Kakeru than Yuka.I liked the episode with her and Kakeru getting laid lol :\"> *blush* .Wish all female characters from anime's were as cool as her and strong[not every girl have's 5 legendary swords at her dispoasal y'know nyaa~-]...she is cute...caring...and have's one great body nyaa~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the most of episodes...It kindda pissed me the episodes that shown me an obsessed Yuka beging for love...In that moment I was screaming at the screen \"you biatch what's the f*ck is wrong with you? If you really love Kakeru snap out of it\" ...That's when I was even more than convinced that Misuzu is the perfect match for Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\r\nIt's been awhile since I last gave a masterpiece rate[yep a 10 nyaa~] .I see in the reviews of others that gave low scores...I don't know why...even though is my first supernatural anime watched I think is well made and deserves the 10'th score, masterpiece.",

            "content": "Save yourself the time and don't bother with this one.  While I can't call it the worst anime I've seen, 11 Eyes certainly has to be up there on that list.  The idea behind it isn't actually bad at all, but the way it was done and really pretty much everything about this anime was just plain awful.\r\n11 Eyes is about a guy named Kakeru and a group of high schoolers that have powers and go into this parallel universe-type thing they call Red Night randomly every once in a while and while there are attacked by the Black Knights.  The waythe first episode or two goes, you think that this might be worth something eventually and keep watching.  Sure, they're moving this story at an impossible pace and I wonder if they can explain everything they need to by the time 12 episodes is up, but there really is some decent potential there.  That's a mistake.  It gets worse.  Generally in this one, you'll be sitting there going \"what the hell just happened and why,\" and ten minutes later when about a tenth of it is explained you go \"Oh, I see.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What about the other 900 questions I had?\"  And no, none of them will be answered.\\n\\n\r\nI call this the \"answer one question in a flashy way so hopefully the viewers forget about all the plotholes there are and enjoy the show\" plot.  It's rather ingenious really.  And it happens in a lot of anime, but there's a real showcase here.  Not of them succeeding in diverting your attention, but in that they really don't answer hardly any questions.  Sometimes a character will realize what's going on and you can see the lightbulb going off in their head, but no one actually says what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music is dark and ominous, but reminds me of a title track in a game that repeats itself over and over again.  It gets kind of annoying after a while as there is no variety at all and even what they give you is nothing to write home about.  I don't think the opening and endings were awful but I've already forgotten them, so they couldn't have been that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters.  HA!  Where should I go with this.  The characters were pretty awful.  When you meet Kakeru at the beginning you probably feel a mixture of pity and annoyance.  He's obviously been shafted his entire life, and that really sucks.  But the way he just wants to avoid contact with anyone other than Yuka, who I guess would be considered the female lead, is pretty annoying.  And most of all, between the character design, the voice, and the way he acts most of the time, he really seems like a (very) bad copy of Lelouch Lamperouge.  Yuka is hard to deal with as well, as she is obviously in love with Kakeru and EVERYONE knows it.  And she pretty much knows everyone knows it, and just wants to spend all time forever with him.  She grew up with Kakeru and his sister, who killed herself when they were kids, in an orphanage.  She was adopted and Kakeru went to live by himself, but they stayed together.  Cute right?  Not so much in this case.  As the show goes on you can tell that she actually is pretty demented.  If anyone else comes close to Kakeru she snaps.  It would be disturbing, but they way they did it made it just seem laughable.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters that play major parts.  But don't worry about them.  If you decide to try and watch this show they're all easy to understand.  And Kusakabe actually isn't that bad of a character.  A little to serious all the time, but overall I'd actually give her passing marks as a character.\\n\\n\r\nNext about the enjoyment.  Watching this show because it seems intriguing is kind of like sticking your head in a mulcher because you wonder what it would feel like.  It's just not a good idea.  After the first couple episodes there's actually enough excitement(because of the potential) that you want to watch a little more.  Even then there's not a whole lot of enjoyment.  It's still more like \"it might get better, it might get better.\"  But it just never does.  And even before the end of the show you're left with a vague feeling of disappointment that you watched this show so far and that it really didn't get better, but in fact continued to get worse.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I have forgotten to mention yet is the art.  The animation is actually not bad, and the action scenes are pretty decent.  The art style is also one that I usually enjoy as well.  I put art off until now so I could talk about the ecchi parts of the show.  Random winds that flip up girls skirts, Yuka wearing nothing but her underwear trying to come on to Kakeru, and clothes getting torn to shreads to reveal a little skin.  Yes, there is a fair amount of ecchi scenes in the anime.  But the way they were done were simply awful.  Most of these ecchi parts are completely unnecessary and in fact detract from the already painfully bad story.  They way they were done was always bad timing and in bad taste.  I usually like some ecchi here and there, but the way they did it here just made it seem inappropriate.  I'm sure they meant for you to think Yuka is losing it when she strips down on someone's front porch to try to get close to Kakeru, but it just seems wrong even for that.  Having said all that, in truth the art and animation of the show is one point that you can say gets a decent grade.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude all of this, I must say once again, don't bother with this show.  It takes a somewhat promising story and decent art and drives it into the ground.  11 Eyes is not a good anime.  I feel like I wasted time watching it, and it's bad enough that I almost feel like I'm wasting time writing this review.  But, maybe someone will read this and decide not to watch the show or at least stop after a couple episodes and not hope, like I did that it will get better.  Overall, I give this one a 4.",

Don't even watch episode 12, if you do that than this show is 10x better.\r\nReview: Show is based off a game so I didn't set my expectations too high going in. The beginning of the show starts off with typical anime high school drama and supernatural junk but half way through the show things start picking up and I was pleasantly surprised at some of the darker and more gruesome issues and incidents that get brought up. One of the scenes in theshow actually made me do a mental cringe at the gruesomeness of the scene(mostly because I didn't expect anything like that at all to happen in this show). Unfortunately the show leads you on in thinking that this is where the show is headed and I began to fall for this show thinking that the ending was going to be a dark and gruesome ending(which are the best endings in my opinion). Oh but how wrong I was to assume that. The last half of the 11th episode had me going like \"WTF? is this?\" and than the 12th episode proceeded to respond to that question with a bitch slap to my intellect... \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes you think that it's one of those rare gems you find in a bunch of cliche and typical anime, but than at the last second the writers polished off the gleam of the gem and all you find yourself left with is a dried up piece of bullshit...\\n\\n\r\nRant(Spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nI haven't played the game that this show is based off of but still, come on writers!! Unwrap those tentacles from around your brains, like literally the Misuzu and Kakeru fuck scene was an insult... Like here I am thinking to myself, did I just watch 10 episodes of an elaborate setup for a hentai... Heck at that point I would've actually appreciated the show more if it did become a hentai scene, but no the writers decided to be like well now that your turned on... Time travelling boner killing plot twist time!!!! GG no re...",

Yes she can be really annoying but there is a reason for it.And there are other character as well which are really well developed.Misuzu,Yukiko,Takahisa,Shiori and the rest of the cast are great characters!And I never understoud why everyone focuses only on Yuka.There are many more characters other than Kakeru and Yuka Bakas!\\n\\n\r\n    ENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\n   Every story ark,every blatle,every dialogue was never boring.And the development of the story was very strong especially the last spech!And even thoughthe ending was not really epic I didn't care,because I wanted those characters to get out of the red night!Een when it was fanservisy I didn't care because of the power of the story!!!\\n\\n\r\n    so OVERALL 10/10\\n\r\nAnd a word of andice,don't let Yuka destroy your reception about this anime and don't have any expectations before you watch ior else you will get disapointed.",

Begin to discover a world where there\u2019s a variety of monologues to be heard that has an uncertain point. Last but not the least, experience a non thrilling ride where usually some of its scenes is just being annoying. Upon watching it you may feel that it has some intriguing and exciting storyline to expect, but it turns out to be a dull story that doesn\u2019t have any unique or amazing element to be amazed on. It has a story that is composed with suchabsurdity which most of them brings a lot of headache to become seriously understandable. Also, as the monologues don\u2019t suit on the situation either on the story, this becomes an exchange of bland thoughts that gives either fluster or total denial on continuing this series. \\n\\n\r\nWith its failure due to its story, there might be a couple or few to be entertained on. One, it contains a fighting scenes that is quite interesting due that it composed of characters that have different abilities and artwork to polish each of its scenes, yet it might be as common for the others to say as it doesn\u2019t stands out to be different or unique. Second, with the help of the music and background sounds it emphasizes the movement and flow of each scene, characters, and effects throughout the show. Lastly, it\u2019s the only thing that this series greatly posses which brings different emotions, CHARACTERS! which is some of them are common, funny, silly, and a source of fan service (just being sarcastic on these, but it\u2019s quite true) that might be the asset of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, my first impression is\u2026 speechless. Cannot describe with just words but can conclude that it is a bunch of lame, stereotype, and somehow non-entertaining due to its foolish actions. I\u2019ll say that the other side (enemies) is much better than most of the leading/non-leading characters, but sadly to say, the series just contains a little amount of episodes that will focus more to the abilities of the enemies or maybe to improve the character development. On its way be glad to see some of the leading/non-leading character that puts effort on giving just a little up to big amount of excitement and thrill. Overall, it\u2019s not good neither bad but don\u2019t expect to see some amazingly different from the characters as they move throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nObviously I can\u2019t understand on what elements they\u2019re trying to focus on this series. It seems that because it contains few episodes they convey on and didn\u2019t manage to emphasize the story itself but rather they add some random scenes just to fill it out, However, these kind of scenes didn\u2019t manage to give anything significant to the show rather it\u2019s full of idiocy that brings disappointment as an overall.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s recommendable with all of its \u2018amazing crap\u2019 aspects. If you are curious about it, just try it out and enter the world of foolishness. As soon as you \u2018finish\u2019 the 12 episodes you may consider yourself lucky to be out to that world. As for me I\u2019m just curious on how the ending went but sadly to say it\u2019s still the same as where I started.",

            "content": "Before I watched 11 eyes I did my research and almost every review said that it  was a total let down. Well I stepped up to the challenge and started watching 11 eyes. At first I was like \"WHAT! why did everyone say this was bad\"? Then halfway through I realized what went wrong...the characters.\r\nStory 7\r\nIm rating it a 7 based on the actuall story and not how it was made. It was quite intersting I mean it revolves around Kakeru Satsuki the leading male and Yuka Minase, childhood friends who are dragged into a mysterious world named \"red night\". In this world thereare cratures and powerfull beings that wish to desroy these 'fragments'. Finding out they are not the only humans they forge alliances in red night and in the real wold. Each person has a secret power which is slowly discoverd through surviving red night. Now if a better company produced 11eyes and kept it on track then i believe it would deserve an 8 but allas...\\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nBeing released in 2009 the animation is still considered quite good. The backgrounds and the lighting used improve the visual experience. Characters look quite good also nothing you would think is 'old'.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nThe opeing song Arrival of Tears is one that I enjoyed it is a rock style with a sprinkle of mystery in the tune. It builds you up and gets you ready for the action in 11 eyes. The ending is one of my favourite ending songs \"sequetia\" is also a rock syled but is more energetic and is fitting for the end. The video for Sequetia is very good be sure to check it out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5\\n\r\nThis I believe is the biggest downfall for 11 eyes. Its not all the characters that are annoying but some change drastically from being loved to thinking \"just DIE already!!\" Youll know what im talking about if you watch the anime. The development was a tad bit slow and even at the end they all go back to normal as if nothing ever changed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5\\n\r\nI have to say once i started this anime i was convinced it was going to be a good action anime that i would remember. But now i just think of it as something my brother suggested to me when i was bored (not listening to him again lol). It just barely tweaked my interest and just when you think things are going good it all comes crashing down again. I might sound a bit too harsh but there are postives in 11 eyes such as the action. The fightings scenes were well done its fluid and moves link with one another, not the best I have seen but still good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\r\nNot one that i would suggeest to anyone unless I knew this was there thing. Be prepared to get annoyed, although I know people that have enjoyed it.\\n\r\n If you are into action, liked school days (you will know why ;P) and watch anime for the music then 11 eyes would suit you :D.\\n\r\nbtw this is my 2nd review (forgot to say it was my 1st on my 1st which was MM!) and I would appreciate and constructive critisims :D.",

            "content": "Well 11eyes was a big surprise. To be honest just before starting watching it i was critical. The storyline seemed so unorigional and i only watched it becuase i needed something to pass the time and for some unknown reason this kept bugging me for quite some time so i decided to finally watch it.\r\nIt was nothing like i thought. Firstly although the whole idea of another world with chosen warriors with special ability's to fight and defend their world has been majorly over used,i realised straight away this wasn't your regular \"other world\" story. The only unorigional thing i found about the anime wasthe characters, they were simple characters, stereotypes even of typical anime characters:\\n\\n\r\nKakeru- the wannabe knight, pushing himself to be better, fighting for the love of his life\\n\r\nYuka- Typical big breasted cute, naive girl, who lets her heart rule her (although she does have a very nice unexpected turn around later on)Lots of panty shots. (you know what i dont get anime girls never seem to change their undies)\\n\r\nMisuzu- Serious, mysterious, takes no crap from anybody, proud older girl\\n\r\nYukiko- (my favourite character; though that may be cause she looks like me and im cosplaying her :P) Petite, bubbly, happy-go-lucky, glass half full, and very into groping i might add (haha she acts like me too)\\n\r\nTakahisa- the bad man! tough guy, street wise with a sad backstory\\n\\n\r\nthe only unorigional character in this was Kukuri the mute girl\\n\\n\r\n11eyes grabs you at the first episode, the relationship between Yuka and Kakeru (if annoying) is endearing and the slow intorduction of different characters is easy going. I loved the fight scenes (and in my opinion Yukiko kicks serious a*s*e lol but i am slightly bias due to my love of her) and the way the relationship between the main characters gets so deep and close \"for friends and for tommorow\" and then is totally ripped apart mainly due to the jealousy due to a certain some one; i wont name names *cough* Yuka *Cough getting a love rival *cough*Misuzu*cough*\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing i hate about 11eyes is that it concentrated too much on Kakeru and Yuka's relationship. If you ask me (and anyone with sense) Yukiko and Takahisa seemed much more in love and their relationship was much more interesting and the spin on their story is so sad and origional it makes me want to cry just thinking about it. I think the only improvement could have been to look more at the other characters in detail beside Kakeru, Yuka and Misuzu\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is somewhat confusing and might i mention not what anyone expected, if your planning on watching this my advice is expect the unexpected because this is not your typical bright and happy ending nonsense this is dark stuff dude that is masquerading as something cute and happy.\\n\\n\r\n11eyes is definately worth a try if your into surprises but i have a feeling its the anime version of marmite; you either love it or you hate it (i love it...though i hate marmite) But luckily you can tell whether you love or hate it within the first episode so its worth a try no matter what. \\n\\n\r\nOh yeah not for kids may seem innocent and sweet but later it gets a little bit more mature (scenes of a veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy slight sexual nature)\\n\\n\r\nPeace and love people \\n\\n\r\nPic-n-mix :)",

You watch thinking of something will be explorated in the plot, but this doesnt happen. The animeis summarized in the following, they enter the black moon after they leave, they enter again and then leave again, nothing makes sense, comes with the story that they are \"fragments\" but nothing is explained, at the beginning of the anime showing something cute but with the passing of the anime suddenly it comes down to killing and blood, containing even scenes of torture, and you actually think, WHAT FUCK IS THAT? The studio and the author had everything to make a story in the least reasonable but the anime is a crap, sometimes something cool happen but in general it's hard to watch, and more hard to finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is actually the best of the anime, The art is very well made and pleasurable to see, besides the characters are beautiful, in fact they are half cliches and half generics but they are very beautiful at all\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, Contains some interesting soundtracks, actually this part of the anime i liked, leaves the anime less bad...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For me this is the worst part in the anime, The characters are all cliches, and almost all are very boring, I think only two characters can be considered good, Takahisa Tajima the gray-haired guy and the girl with glasses, the protagonist is very poorly done, it looks like it will get strong But it never stays, you watch the anime with the hope that it will be powerful with that story from his eye, but he never stays and in the anime you all feel very angry at him, and your friend yuka is the other bad character made for me The worst of the anime, she does not add the work to anything and only appears to cause disgrace, with scenes in which with her jealousy do bad things happen, it is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I do not like it at all and if you want to watch with high expectations, give up, just as I will frustrate you, but for being a short anime, I will not say, do not watch in any way, I say instead you can watch, because In the end you can add another anime to your account ...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Being very good with the anime, I will give a 4, believe it doesnt deserve even a 4, the anime is weak and how many animes that exist is more a work cliche and failed.   \\n",

This anime does have action, love (shown in odd, eerie ways), and a couple unexpected plot twists.  The only downer with this show (at least in my opinion) are tiny placements of fan service (yuka's panty shots, swimsuit scene ODDLY PLACED MAKING ZERO SENSE, yuka's hideous obsession with the protagonist, Kakeru).  The story itself doesn't have much of a connection with one of the main characters (I refuse to give any spoilers to those interested) and having watched 10 episodes of thisseries I'm still curious as to how this show will unravel in just the final 2 episodes.  After the series progresses there's a definite love triangle and the two female characters involved will definitely have to settle it out themselves from some previous scenes I noticed.  Overall, I find this series so far just average because the story isn't too compelling and the silly connection between modern-day Japan and some Eastern European/Russian ripoff nation called Dracsavania or something like that.  If you like witches, young children fighting Black Knights (which are supposedly the good guys in this story), and silly inserts of Dark-Aged wannabe history, then this anime franchise is up your alley (thankfully this show will be short-lived as it will only span 12 episodes long and will stop airing shortly)!",

            "content": "There is one question that people are constantly debating: Which is worse: movies based on video games, or video games based of movies? Judging by this show alone, I say that anime based off video games suck too. Yes, this was based of an Adult Visual Novel. But enough about that, lets dive right in to this failure and see why it... well.... failed.\r\nThe first problem itself is the actual plot. The red night, which I guess is a parallel dimension that comes and goes whenever the hell it feels like it (yeah it doesn't explain very well what it is. Get used to this.),traps a group of six teens inside of it and forces them to fight these black knights, and coincidentally, there happen to be six of them as well.  This plot was interesting at first, but it is killed by it's own uncreative nature later on. Everything was so predictable; their plot twists were so bland it makes you wander if they were really trying.  Like here's one of the genius plot devices they attempted to throw me on a loop with. We see our main protagonist Kakeru's sister die in the first episode, or at least that what they say what happened. I didn't know what was going on though, and if you see the way she supposedly \"died\", you'll be confused as hell too. Later on, a character that looks exactly like his sister joins the group, and Kakeru just sort of accepts it, and there's so many things wrong with that right there, but if I go over all the reasons you'll be reading this for about a day. Later on it turns out that she is his sister from yet another parallel dimension. Yeah, haven't seen that before. The lack of imagination here is truly a marvel of nature. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, well lets just say that it's very predicable too. I've seen these types of characters so many times in anime. Well actually, there is a difference. These characters are so much more lamer to the point that they're the bare minimum of \"characters.\" Main male protagonist with a tragic past trying to protect his childhood friend, Yuka, check. Childhood friend who is obviously in love with the protagonist and gets jealous if any other girl tries to approach him, check. But the biggest failure of all is probably Misuzu Kusakabe, who starts out as a strong, Independent woman who actually saves Kakeru and Yuka all the time during the first few episodes of the show. She starts out as an interesting character, but then later on, after losing a fight to one of the black knights (who turns out to be one of her ancestors. I know, just go with it), she gets insanely depressed and practically gives up fighting,all just to make the Kakeru pick up the torch and start looking awesome. And as for the other characters, well, they're either forgettable or annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about this series is the soundtrack, which is pretty awesome. Sadly though, most of them sound very insanely similar to each other, again, great creativity on their part. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay, nothing special really. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is just a money making product. In fact, the production of this anime probably went something like this:\\n\\n\r\n\"Hey, why don't we make an anime based off a game, thus making quick money? We don't have to try to make it good or put actual effort into it, cause people who liked the game will buy this crap reguardless.\"\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor, and just don't watch it.   \\n",

            "content": "Interesting and dark conception in eroge adaptation. It was suppose to be bloody and mysterious but was shabby and schematic. Anime with wasted potential. \r\nSatsuki Kakeru lost his sister five years ego. She was his only family. Up till then the stepparents of Yuki Minase, his childhood friend took care of him. And then one day, when Kakeru and Yuki were returning from school, the moon turned red. They arrived to unknown alternative world, full of monsters and no humans. Presently they returned to their own world but they were aware this trip can repeat. When they arrive to the world with red moon again,they meet beings called Black Knights, that want to kill everyone who can travel to other worlds. Yuki and Kakeru along with three other school friends tries to protect themselves from attacks of mysterious beings.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again we have an adaptation of eroge. The game \u201c11Eyes\u201d is a visual novel with some gore and sex scenes. The anime isn\u2019t that typical eroge adaptation. We don\u2019t have panties on half of screen. Sometimes pantyshots are shown in unsuitable moments, even in serious moments but it isn\u2019t obtrusive that much. Concerning underwear scenes, there are fanservice situations but they are also important to the whole plot. They develop characters in some way. \\n\\n\r\nFirst episodes are really schematic. Teenagers spend their free time in school, try to find some information about the other world. Then the red moon appears and they must fight some monsters and defeat Black Knights. This formula repeat over and over and may be boring for a lot of people. \\n\\n\r\nAll the time we have many uncertainties. This can attract some people. End includes some unexpected twists. Threads that were accepted at first sight are not that obvious. The puzzle which includes questions \u201cWho is the girl in the crystal and why teenagers must safe her?\u201d and \u201cWhy do Dark Knights wants to kill the children?\u201d  Only this threads are interesting. The rest is quite boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t well adapt. The conception is quite interesting: girl from mage family, who uses five legendary katanas; assassin with attractive skills. All this characters with supernatural powers, little girl trapped in the crystal, Dark Knights with quaint design. This could go well. But the authors went wrong somewhere. There are many logic errors and shabby dialogs. The interesting conception was wasted. Instead of that we have teenager who stray over the place with no reason.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone have some kind of supernatural skills, that helps them to fight the Dark Knights. Characters appears to be interesting at some point but the story doesn\u2019t gave them opportunity to develop. Everything goes so fast, that the advantages can\u2019t be notice. As if the authors want to accommodate everything that was in the game. Characters suddenly appears from nowhere, relocate to another place and we don\u2019t even know when it occur. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design are similar to that in the game. Pretty manga like faces doesn\u2019t disturb the dark and brutal scenes. The backgrounds are very simple, but the profiles looks detailed. Apparently the anime is more censored compared to game, with erotic scenes as well as bloody moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is well selected. When the red moon appears the chorus start to sing and when it\u2019s time for a fight we have faster piece. There are moments with horror like themes but their goal is not to scare but to emphasize the atmosphere . Opening and ending songs are also climatic.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless \u201c11Eyes\u201d is another wasted potential. It was suppose to be dark and bloody, with little bit mature erotic scenes. Somewhere the authors lost all ideas and it didn\u2019t go well. Well done action anime, too lofty treated, that lead to shabby show. Sometimes it were original and interesting, sometimes boring and trivial.\\n\\n",

            "content": "11 Eyes could have been really excellent. It had plenty of things going right for it in the first episode that I was completely pulled in. I ended up watching this whole anime straight, and as I progressed, the quality of what I was watching slowly dwindled. The first episode arose so many questions, and as the anime attempted to answer them, the plot really started to make less and less sense. \r\nArt: 10\r\nI really love the art of this anime, as this is what originally made me want to watch it. I found the main female protagonist (Yuka) very cute, especially in episode one.The villains are quite interesting, and everything looks really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound wasn't as appealing to me. The voice actors did a good job, as expected of Japan. Sound effects are fair as well. I didn't find any background music very memorable or powerful, and I wouldn't remember any of it if I heard some now. I also didn't care for the opening or ending theme songs.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 2\\n\r\nThis is the real problem with this anime. Its plot is good, it could easily be an excellent plot within the video game it came from. However, when told in the anime, it suffers from two issues: pace and script. this anime, like many others, is a twelve episoder. Most anime thats only twelve eps long suffer from the same issue of pacing. Twelve episodes honestly just isn't enough to tell a good story in. This anime, however, seemed to have been made with the idea that it was going to get more episodes, and then six episodes in the creators learned they only have six episodes left to finish the story. The first six or so episodes were good; they introduced new characters, developed current characters, blah blah. The last six episodes felt really rushed. This is a big problem too, as virtually all of the back plot is revealed in these episodes. Due to this, answers to certain questions made no sense sometimes, all contributing to a horrible ending. The script is the other issue. Besides just annoying script which dumbed down to'\"Yuka, I will protect you!\" and \"Kakeru-kun\" at least ten times per episode, the script is really stale. The characters feel really stereotypical and their words make it worse. Some major event could be going on in the story, and the character's script makes them sound like they have brain damage.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nThis is the other problem with the anime. The characters in this anime all feel stereotypical, one dimensional, and brain-damaged. However, this isn't the main problem. The bigger issue comes from how they develop over the episodes. The main girl protagonist Yuka, like I said above, is extremely cute in episode one. However, as the episodes pass, she begins to become extremely hysterical and extremely possessive over the main boy protagonist. Its a degradation that is completely uncalled for and basically ruins an originally great character. The main boy protagonist Kakeru, has a brick instead of a brain, and is as uninteresting as it gets. Misusu, a red haired swordsman, like Yuka, starts off extremely interesting, but slowly degrades into mu. Misusu basically starts off the strongest character of the team, and slowly gets weaker and weaker for no reason at all until by the closing episodes she is the weakest of the team.Other characters suffer the same fate, though I will say that I felt the pyrokineticist was interesting till the end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was bad. It did entertain me though, and I kept watching as I wanted to see what happened next. I theorize that had this anime been a healthy twenty six episode anime, it might have had more success pacing those later episodes, and developing the story better. However, those extra episodes wouldn't do any good unless a massive percent of the script had improvements. This anime was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't mind being disappointed.",

Great concept and starts off well but don't think the makers had a clue where to take the story and got too far ahead of themselves. It's hard to decide where the finish of this anime should've been. The last episode is overambitous and just plain confusing. The Episode before would've been too depressing. Great twist but just spoiled by the lack of direction it took after that. Also some quite funny fanservice/innuendo takes place too.\r\nArt ( 7 )\r\nOneof the best aspects of the anime. The colouring to show the difference between the two world is quite clever and the characters, including the 'villains' are well designed.\\n\\n\r\nSound ( 7 )\\n\\n\r\nThe other better attribute of this anime. Rocking Opening, catchy Ending and the background music during the shows themselves really sets the mood for what's on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ( 6 )\\n\\n\r\nSome backstories are great, some are no-existent, but it doesn't matter because it all goes to hell during the last finale anyway.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ( 6 )\\n\\n\r\nWould've been bit more if it wasn't for some of the points I mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ( 6 )\\n\\n\r\nSame as above.

            "content": "*Just a warning this WILL contain spoilers, but hey you couldn't spoil this anime anymore if you tried*\r\nIn the beginning of this anime I felt that it had potential and had a place to go so I was intrigued and kept watching. Little did I know that this anime, 11eyes, would leave me utterly disappointed.\r\nThe action scenes and the overall battles were probably the only thing I decently enjoyed in this entire show. But even during these parts all I could think about was how bad the storyline was getting. In all honesty I'm all for supernatural shows with drama or love triangles within thembut this was saddening.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that set me off during the show was that it turns out all the bad guys were actually good guys. Now I wouldn't have mind so much if they just executed it better rather than just saying \"Your existence is a sin\" to the main characters. Hell they tried to kill the main characters 1-1 though they could of teamed up against them to kill them or even ask them to join them in protecting the world (Or whatever they ended up protecting).\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing that set me off was the main character's power. Now I know having a power to see the future can be common in some magic shows and in all honesty it isn't always that bad, but they made his power go from just seeing attacks to just seeing the entire future!!! I mean c'mon they wasted a whole episode just on his vision and that alone ticked me off. What added to that was he got with my favorite character rather than the crazy girl he loves, which I'll get to in a min. In the end after seeing the vision he ended up moving slightly and changing it. However in the end the world still ended.\\n\\n\r\nYuka...is crazy. She tried to kill another \"good guy\", or were they bad guys...Any who she did that. And the main character still loves her which I can respect since I love Mirai Nikki, but she didn't do anything good the entire story either for their cause or for her love.\\n\\n\r\nMy last point is the ending. Oh this gosh darn ending. After killing off many of the characters and saying O well there is nothing more anyone can do they destroy the world. Great huh. But then the three that are left go to a different universe and everything is okay...What. The. Hell. So in the end the entire story is meaningless and all the deaths are meaningless because they went somewhere else...\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I basically have to say. Though I could talk about the different universes and the sister or angel that the writers threw in there but I would rather not. In the end this is just a rather disappointing show overall. All I could do is try to forget it ever happened, or hope it was all from a vision and it turns out I never actually watched it.",

They all have special powers, and in the Red Moon Night dimension they fight against the Black knights, this is the basic premise of the show.\r\n-> Later, while remaining kinda episodic with the Red Moon events, the plot gets some twists and gets deeper,involving more and more stuff and relating it with the premise with the purpose of having a strong, complex show. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall, the plot isn't really bad and the twists, although predictable, conserve some logic, but there are plotholes, and big ones.. In fact, when analyzing the plot you get absolutely no reason of why the students were forced to enter the \"Red Moon Night\" on the first place, therefore nullifying the premise, and of course, eventually all the story, it just doesn't make sense once you get all the pieces.\\n\\n\r\n-> The art and sound of 11eyes was pretty decent in my opinion and a strong quality of this show, both the art and sound helped to get  into the \"Dark\" environment that the Red Moon Night was supposed to be, with some graphic violence here and there to make the things more impressive. It works, and it works well, so no complaints here\\n\\n\r\n-> 11eyes also tries to have action and romance, but in both aspects failed miserably, on \"action\" there isn't much scenes worth of mentioning, and worse yet, what could have been the best scenes, are either cut to continue the story in another place, or never happen. To avoid the spoilers i will just say \"The ultimate battle is something you don't watch\"\\n\\n\r\n->The romance is basically a jealous driven love triangle between Yuka, Kakeru and Misuzu, the 3 main characters, but the problem here is Yuka becomes an extremely awkward character, ruining everything (and serving as a lame trigger to the situation of the final episodes). As for Misuzu, she spends more time dealing with her own feelings instead of competing for Kakuro, and worse, Kakuro was never doubtful.. So in the end you have an awkward character resulting from an imaginary, and ergo, no romance\\n\\n\r\n-> The last major problem of 11eyes resides on character development, because as soon as Kakeru \"awakens\" his power the rest of the cast slowly becomes less and less relevant.. The show also gets \"deus ex machina\" at times, maybe because the show wasn't clearly enough with the concept of \"dimensions\"...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, 11eyes left a bittersweet taste because it had the potential to become something awesome but it just doesn't, still as i said earlier, the plot doesn't fall into complete nonsense and you can actually get some enjoyment from it, i did, at least for the first half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nYou should see at least: Hmm, since in my opinion the \"Red Moon Night\" becomes episodic, then if you find it dreadful at the 4th episode you should stop, but if you don't, continue until the end, and enjoy the coherent with the plot but ridiculous final 2 episodes :D\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it, another review.. not much anime for me atm (exams week) but maybe i'll review a \"classic\" next..\\n\\n\r\nGood luck y'all and be happy, because Hikikomori is now an Oxford dictionary entry :D\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Where can I start? Well, it's been fun to analyze this show for my first review. So, let's get to it, even though i'm late by about 8 years, hopefully you guys go easy on me:\r\nArt/Animation- \r\nThere is not much to talk about here. Since this anime is from 2009 and I didn't see too much older anime, it surprised me that the art was pretty good. However I personally don't like the style of the female characters, where their face almost always looks the same, though I believe that is personal preference.\r\nSound- \r\nThis was actually pretty interesting. The OST itself is really good. However,I noticed (mostly at the beggining) that while the sound fits the location it did not always fit the situation and the characters. I think this would have been amazing on a video game for example, where sometimes the music only plays for the location you are at. Not many would notice that though, so I would still say that it is good. The voice acting is pretty normal as well, apart from some cringy parts; can't blame the voice actors though, it's not the sound.  \\n\r\nAs for the OP and ED, I always believe that whether or not you like the song and music is decided by your own preference. The animation is a pretty normal showcase of the characters for both OP and ED, though I did notice that there are some things some may consider spoilers in them, and it tries to get a bit too dramatic in the opening, to a level I would call cringy. It's not bad though, and I did like the songs. \\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\nAnd now we start going down. I must say, the story itself is not so bad as I expected it to be from reviews I read. While not the most original, it's base is very solid as you may notice in the first few episodes, and does what's is supposed to do quite well, and executing the genres it shows in a pretty good way. Though, as a drama lover, I noticed some forced drama (though not too much) and pretty bad one as well, some of it felt like it was ment for kids. Though this is not the worst, it did hurt the experience a bit. Thankfully fanservice did not interfere too much, something I was worried about. So what keeps this show from getting a higher score you may ask? That title goes to a part some may consider to be a part of the story, but I would say it needs it's own part here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- \\n\r\nIf you read what I said about the story itself, you will probably know- The characters are probably the worst part of this show. Oh, where to start; Probably my least favorite deuteragonist of all time, which means alot, since I usually hate them. Usually the quality of a character is shown by it's role in the story, and how well it does what it's supposed to do. In this case, not only is she a bad character, but only one who has a personality that makes you want to hate her. That would be fine if that was her role, but she is the one the main character fights to protect so much and every one of the characters love her. If you don't hate her at the beggining you will later. And hey, you know that character who is supposed to be the most annoying at first, as if he is ignorant of everything? He is actually the least annoying of all. On the first half I came prepared to tell you how bad the antagonists are, though that did change for good (A BIT) on the second half. Most characters execute their role poorly, some don't even have a clear one. There are many more things I want to say about this, but they contain spoilers, so if you are really curious you will need to watch the show for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nOVA- \\n\r\nI don't want to write a full review for the OVA which is usually considered episode 13. I would just say it is pretty funny after watching the show, though contains 100% more fanservice and is much more perverted then the main show, some may not like that. Still, if you did finish the show I would reccomend you check it out. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Personal Opinion- \\n\r\nI do not believe this show is deservant of more then 8/10 , but also not of less then 5/10. It was average in my opinion. I must say, it was pretty fun to watch, but the problems were made apparent. I think you should watch it if you don't have much to do, or if you want to analyze and think what are the negatives and positives are for yourself like I did, which I found really fun, though I don't want that to change the ratings I give for the show. Personally I think it deserved a 6/10, \"Fair\", but I would understand anyone who would give it 5 or 7.",

            "content": "This anime was a complete waste of time for me\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe story starts off promising. The concept is kinda cool and possesses some potential. There's the generic 'high school kids save the world' thing, which is fine. Then the plot just sort of throws itself off a cliff. The supposed 'plot twist' completely lacks any sort of impact. I felt confused and lost in the last few episodes until I looked it up because it completely fails to present itself in a coherent manner. The show was indulging in plot poison, killing off character after character for the sake of it until the end whereoh lolz jk everyone comes back to life cos why not!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nArt was fair. Not fantastic, but no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe opening song wasn't my cup of tea, but it looks like some people really enjoyed it. No ost stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nEvery damn character is irritating and a goddamn pain in the ass. The only character I liked was Misuzu. She's badass and seems to know what she's doing \u2013 but, as the story progresses, she gets completely sidelined and becomes dependent on Kakeru. Kakeru is meh, basically every generic, personality-less male lead ever. \\n\\n\r\nYuka is definitely the most irritating character I've seen in anime. She's actually dumb, endlessly walking into traps and at one point, straight-up tried to murder Misuzu?? I suppose cos the show was hopping on the yandere bandwagon. I'm surprised Misuzu didn't say shit about it and it was never brought up again\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast feel like they're there to fill up the space. There's the hothead archetype, the split personality archetype (who changes her personality by taking off her glasses?? k), etc. There's the school nurse too, who adds nothing to the story except for her boobs to make up for the lack of plot. All of them are shallow and one-note. The antagonists, similarly, are terribly written with crappy, unappealing designs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nwould've given it a 0/10 if I could. I haven't got the slightest clue why I managed to push through to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm having a hard time believing that the average rating even reaches a passing mark. \\n",

I mean showing underwear is fine, but this is just pathetic and tasteless. \r\nYuka is very plain, and is basically another version of Kazumi from Shakugan no Shana (even down to looks). She is overly obsessed with Kakeru, and it's annoying.I actually like it when she walks in during inopportune times with him and misuzu. She gets worse as the series progresses, her obsession gets to the point where she doesn't care about anyone else, and I just want to see her get rejected. I don't know how he can stand her!\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are enjoyable, and I enjoy all of the other characters. I look forward to seeing how it ends.",

Also, a certin character ( don't want to mention any names *cough* Yuka *cough*) just became beyond annoying. Also, can anyone say unwanted fan service? Right when the anime started for the worst, they changed most female characters to become more fan servicefriendly which just destroyed any chance to salvage the ending.

However, some of the action scenes were animated very poorly. One of the characters, who is supposedly very strong, seems slow and not very skilled in many of these scenes. The sword fighting is just people waving their swords a little and using the same blocks over and over again. Other than that, however, the animation was good.\r\nVoice Acting: 10/10\r\nI didn't think there was anything wrong with this. Their voices were not monotonous, and you could tell what theywere felling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThis was okay, but the characters were extremely cliche, and it seemed that sometimes the characters weren't needed, and then killed off later. Also, there was character development in some characters, but none at all in others.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThe story started out fine. However, there are many plot holes within this anime, and things weren't explained clearly, creating some confusion. It also seemed rushed. It goes at a steady pace until the last half of the last episode, where it seems like they didn't have any time, so they just killed off the bad guy with one shot. The entire resolution and epilogue is rushed into the last few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It kept me excited for each episode, and I didn't get bored at all.

Kakeru (played by the brilliant Daisuke Ono) is not your normal orphan.  He has the \"Eye of Aeon\" which helps him see moves before the enemy makes the move (theUS Government wishes they had a weapon like that)... Yuka is a girl who is his friend and was a orphan too until she was adopted... Misuzu is a awesome sword-fighting miko with healing powers...\\n\\n\r\nI have really enjoyed the battle scenes in this, they are stunning but can be bloody so this anime is not for the faint of heart.

The usual damsel in distress and the jealousy became annoying. I thought that if I continue to watch this anime, it might lead to something strong or good.

The characters were unique and there was something I liked about each character. It seemed like it was going to be a great series.with a mix of different genres. \r\nAfter watching about 6-7 episodes, I started to get pretty bored of it, but I carried on watching anyway because I wanted to know the end. It was all pretty simple and things/characters were easy to remember, but then loads of different things started to happen at the sametime that it was hard to keep track of everything. Then more characters were introduced which just made me want to stop watching as they were talking about things that I honestly could not remember even happening or been said before. Anything that happened wasn't really very exciting after that. Things just started to get weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good in my opinion but the fight scene's were pretty dull and I wish they were better. A lot of the time there were scenes were they just told you what happened and didn't actually show you it being done. \\n\r\nexample: someone goes and tells another that a certain someone has died in battle yet it never actually showed the battle in which they died, which was a big disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nI watched until the end as its fair to say that it was a terrible ending and it just seemed like they couldn't be bothered to think of a good end so they just put anything they could think of as an end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 6/10. because of the fact that it's been less than a week since I finished the series and I can't even remember the main characters name. Nothing stood out. However I liked the characters and the general storyline, plus the art was great. That's all.",

You can see how the studio tries to get their characters deeper, but they don't succeed.\r\nIt also explains why the plot occasinally became weak, but it never became unwatchable. Most visual novel adaptions (that I've seen) have had a happy and bright feel to it, but 11eyes is different because the theme is more darker.If you like dark animes and fighting scenes with gore, I think you will enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime might have been better if they had skipped the forced ecchi parts.

            "content": "11eyes\u2019 story centers around our main characters, \r\nKakeru Satsuki, and Yuka Minase, who are both just normal high school students. However, their realities fall apart when they are suddenly dragged into this strange world known as the \u201cRed Night.\u201d  Except for some red fog that covers the area this world looks almost identical to the world Kakeru and Yuka know. Our heroes are in for even more of a surprise when these grotesque monsters start to attack them. Right when it looks like it\u2019s all over, Kakeru and Yuka are suddenly transported back to their own world with their mental scars being the onlyproof that they had ever been there. Kakeru and Yuka, along with a few others, are dragged back in and out of the Red Night constantly without warning as these creatures called the \u201cBlack Knights\u201d mercilessly hunt our heroes down. Only those brought to the Red Night are aware of its existence, while everyone else is blissfully ignorant. Now some other stuff happens of course, but that\u2019s how the story unfolds for the most part. Now if you\u2019re like me this story may seem kind of familiar to you. It may remind you of  Persona 3 perhaps. The Red Night reminds me pretty heavily of the Midnight Hour. Not only that, but the monsters look like something straight out of P3. The whole anime also feels like it\u2019s going for that darker more serious tone of storytelling like P3 as well. I mean, even Kakeru looks like a somehow edgier version of the P3 protagonist that they decided to slap an eye patch on. None of this means I think it was inspired by P3 by any means, but as a giant Persona fan the similarities are definitely interesting and worth noting.\\n\r\nI think the premise of the story is actually pretty interesting. I really enjoy the idea that these characters can suddenly be dragged into this other world at any time without warning. It\u2019s just kind of a shame how the story unfolds for most of the anime. Our heroes are dragged into the Red Night, they are then hunted down by the Black Knights, our heroes often kill one of them, and then rinse and repeat. The second half of the anime is way more interesting, though. I will say that the pacing of the story can feel a little off at times. Episode 12 of the series is pretty rushed, and the episode before that had a neat concept, but I think they used it mainly for shock value and as such, was mostly unnecessary. There was an episode 13, but we won\u2019t talk about that. Episode 12 is the real ending. 13 was pretty funny to watch but was one of the oddest most unnecessary episodes of an anime I\u2019ve ever watched. Now I won\u2019t go into the ending for obvious reasons, but I will say I actually liked it more than most people seem to. Well, more accurately, I like the spiral of event that leads to the end. Episode 12 leaves a lot to be desired honestly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, boy, grab some popcorn everyone, It\u2019s time to talk about the characters. I prefer to call Kakeru \u201cEdgy McEdgelord,\u201d after his personality, or I\u2019m sorry, his lack of one. Kakeru is your typically \u201cLook at me, I have a tragic past that made me cold\u201d type of main character. He never shuts up about how he\u2019ll protect Yuka at any cost, which in all fairness, Yuka is such a useless character that she needs protecting. Yuka exists purely to grow Kakeru\u2019s own ego and help him fulfill his brave, strong, alpha male, main character role. Everything from Kakeru\u2019s character design, the way he talks, and his actions all bleed edginess. I could seriously slice bread on this man\u2019s edge. His edginess could definitely be annoying to some, but I find pretty funny more than anything else, which makes it impossible for me to take him, as well as this anime serious. As I mentioned about Yuka, she\u2019s useless. I wish I had more to comment about, but aside from the random out of place panty shots they use her for (which only makes it harder to take this anime seriously) she\u2019s completely useless, uninteresting and exists purely to be protected by our Edgelord. Now, for the most part, everything I just said about Yuka is true, however for reasons I can\u2019t go into without spoiling stuff Yuka gets infinitely more interesting towards the end of the anime, so keep that in mind. As for other characters, you have Yukiko Hirohara, a loud energetic girl that actually has a pretty interesting backstory, although the anime doesn\u2019t go into depth about it as much as I\u2019d like, which is a shame. I find her more annoying than anything else most of the time. She goes around randomly groping girls because they need to please the perverts, of course. You have Takahisa Tajima, he\u2019s your typical delinquent. Aside from the fact that he\u2019s eating food in almost every scene, which is a little humorous, he\u2019s pretty boring. Next is Misuzu Kusakabe, my personal favorite character, not that that\u2019s saying much. My reason for liking Misuzu is mainly because I think she\u2019s the coolest character in the series and, who like Yukiko, has a pretty interesting backstory that isn\u2019t fleshed out very much sadly. Next is Kukuri Tachibana, who seems to have lost her ability to speak, and communicates by writing on a notepad because of it. She seems to resemble Kakeru\u2019s sister who took her own life many years ago. Can\u2019t go into much without spoiling things, but I will add that I think Kukuri has a really cute smile. Not sure why that\u2019s the main thing that sticks out to me, but she does. There are other characters, but that covers the main cast for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the anime is pretty decent. It\u2019s not going to win any awards or anything, but it looks fine for its time and I\u2019ve never really noticed any drops in quality. The way the monsters are designed is again fine. The most common monsters in the Red Night may look like something straight out of an RPG, but they are actually pretty creepy. The way their jaws drop and let out this bloodcurdling whale like scream is actually slightly terrifying, so I give the anime major points for that. The sound and visual effects that happen when the Red Night begins is also pretty eerie and intense. The opening song for the series (Arrival of Tears) gives off that nostalgic vibe that I often get from older anime, and I really enjoy it. The song and visuals fit the themes in the show really well. Overall Arrival of Tears is catchy and fits the anime, which is all an opening really needs to do. Sequentia the ending song of 11eyes, like the opening, gets its job done. Once again the song itself is decently catchy and fits the show as it provides a nice wind down after the cliffhangers this anime loves to throw at the end of its episodes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n11eyes is an anime that really had the potential to be great, but unfortunately, it fell short in its generic underdeveloped characters as well as it\u2019s execution.\\n\r\nThat being said 11eyes isn\u2019t all bad. Regardless of what I\u2019ve said I actually enjoyed watching through it quite a bit and found it really exciting. I mean, I binged episodes 7-13 in one sitting. With all that being said, I always believe you should watch the anime yourself and build your own opinion. Everything I wrote here is just my own opinion after all and it isn\u2019t any more or less valid than anybody else\u2019s.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                                I give 11eyes \\n\r\n                   4 eyes out of 11- or 10 I suppose\\n",

The love triangle was out of the blue, the 11th episode was pointless, and overall it was crazy.  So if you have free time I recommend using it to find another anime to watch.\r\nTadgh: This thing was a roller coaster. I don't even know what to say. The art style was good, sound quality was good, all the technical stuff was top notch. The story just threw me for loop after loop. All that I'll say is thatit has a normal build-up for the first several episodes then it falls into a downward spiral that doesn't stop until it hits bottom. If you have some time with absolutely nothing good to do, give it a whirl, but I certainly won't be checking it out again.\\n\\n\r\nDr. R Dash: Okay well when we first started this anime from the beginning i knew I was not going to absolutely love this due to the amount of fan service i just don't get into that. But as the show continued and the ridiculous fan service scenes got worse and the story began to unfold i just kept dreading each episode. I was sad how everything ended because it was so blunt and awful I personally did not enjoy this i'm sure there is more info in the manga if there is one but this pony will not go read that manga. the main plot to this anime is don't cheat around on your mentally unstable girl friend... well that's what i got from it at least :/\\n\\n\r\nRasanaph- \"Umm...yeah...so...no.\" \\n\\n\r\nBrocky: ..........what they said.",

            "content": "This had a great potential, which was absolutely crashed by poor budget. No, seriously. Either the budget was miserable, or this anime had an idiot for a director. I can't help, but feel bitter about this, but I guess, it can't be helped.\r\nSo, about the story. As I said before, it had a pretty amazing potential indeed, but unfortunately, the story develops from a very wrong point. Yes, the concepts like this are pretty common, but that would be forgivable, if the events were set right. However, in this case, the development is pretty fragmented and corrupt. A lot of important moments were missing, alot of important moments weren't set right. Story development takes 6/10 points.\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was the thing that made me start watching this. Until today, the art of 11eyes remains one of my favorites. The characters were designed nicely, even though the concentration point was moe, there weren't much unnecessary details, like ridiculously big and bouncing boobs. There were pantyshots, but that's okay. Aside from the art itself, the animation wasn't so good and that disappointed me very much. art & animation get 8/10\\n\r\nSound was the best part about this anime. Starting from the SFX, onto the OST, OP-ED themes, everything was pretty much amazing. Opening and ending sequences were really good, soundtracks were lively, strong and just made you listen to them. I also liked the twisted Gothic feel of the music. SFX were just top notch, so Sound part gets 10/10. \\n\r\nCharacter design was pretty poor, almost all of them were standard personality types, like the cute yandere Yukiko and a tsundere - Tajima. Sometimes, some of them were utterly annoying and only a couple of characters saving the show. Character composure takes 6/10 points.\\n\r\nThe enjoyment part is the most interesting one, in fact. Even though the anime isn't that good, I, personally, enjoyed it very much. The storyline development was poor, the characters were annoying, animation was pretty rough, but I still liked it. Somehow, the atmosphere of the show itself makes it enjoyable and pleasant to watch. Enjoyment takes 8/10.\\n\r\nOverall, the show was not that special, but still outstanding from most of the others, with who knows what. I'll say it again - the atmosphere of the show was very captivating, thanks to the decent art and amazing music, with poor storyline and character composure opposing it. Overall, the show gets 6/10 points. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that in pleasant to WATCH and LISTEN to, then 11eyes is just for you. However, if you need some thinking material and are looking for a solid, composed plot with it's twists and what not, then stay away from this.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first actual review, and I'm sorry if I made a mistake somewhere ^^\" I may have been a bit soft on rating this, but I'm trying to kill off my subjective opinion.",

            "content": "11 Eyes... I started watching this anime on my iPod Touch without the slightest idea what it was; But the first episode drew me in with the art style and a promising story as well as romance (which i like). I was wrong. Terribly, Terribly wrong. Even as the series was moving on... I was wishing for a happy ending with the main character and the heroine living happily ever after with a kiss. Boy, was I wrong.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe first episode was great, it really was. And some of the elements in the whole anime was also something that was in my taste - thespecial abilities and the main character's eye, etc (shows why I like Code Geass so much o_o). \\n\r\nThen... it.... just... got... depressing.\\n\r\nThe main heroine... failed... I'm sorry. She turned from this cute, moe girl into this weird, hysterical maniac and the main character was oblivious the whole time;;\\n\r\nSERIOUSLY, WHAT WERE THE PRODUCERS THINKING??\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art, for one, was superb (which it should be or else the whole series gets like a 1). The anime I guess was meant to be one of those Moe animes - which I'm fine with (actually, I'm VERY happy with) - and there were some fan services (and I was served quite well). \\n\r\nThe art for both girls and boys are done quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED is also quite good and the scenes that go with it aren't the lowest grade either. The OP and ED was something I could listen to anytime.\\n\r\nAlso, the BGM used in the anime was quite amazing and matched the scenes (sort of). If you've watched it, you'd know it. That tune just gets stuck into your head (the tune that comes in when they move in the Crimson Night) - you know the Bam-Ba-Bam Bam-Ba-Bam Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bam x2. It sounds dramatic... idk O-O\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nNow if I'd only watched the first 1~3 episodes, I'd be like \"I'll give this a 8~9 anytime\" but NO. Sadly, I had to watch the whole thing including the parts where the cute little girl becomes School Day-ish (We all know who I'm talking about). \\n\r\nAlso, the main character can get really frustrating because of his stupid resolve which is just \"I want to protect Yuka\" - which Yuka becomes.... whoops no spoilers...\\n\r\nAll the other characters, too, were done poorly... though depending on how you look at it, you can like them (I liked them as well). BUT, the only reason why this whole character thing is a 4 is because of the execution of their role. Dead People. Get it? No? Maybe 'Crazy People' would also work. Hmm... still not enough? One word, 'Depressing' would sum it up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nNow this was one of those anime that no matter how bad it was done, you kind of are sucked into it (probably cuz of the art... idk). I found myself watching this anime without much (if any) moments of bored-ness. \\n\r\nHonestly, if this anime had an happy ending, without all the characters just dying here and there (which I should've seen coming considering the main character was stabbed in the stomach and his sister commited suicide), then it would've gotten at least an 8.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really regret watching this show... I just regret that I didn't realize this whole show was a troll show...",

            "content": "Story 6/10\r\nThe story was okay, but a little vague. They don't really tell you what's going on until the end. In the beginning it was pretty good but everything suddenly got VERY strange and shifted around a lot. In the beginning it started out with some high school kids who got taken to this alternate version of the world, fighting these black knights, with really no explanation whatsoever. The Black Knights don't even explain why they're trying to kill them. Then everything just got a little odd...and because I'm trying to not include any spoilers, I can't say anymore. So for it being good inthe beginning, I'll give it a 6 for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the art I think was pretty amazing. I love the way the hair and eyes were drawn, and I just think it was very good. The only problem I have is how they're only in their school uniforms the entire time. Nothing like kicking some Black Knight butt in my school uniform. So they pretty much didn't have any protection or anything. They could have gotten some battle outfits or something once they enter the Red Night. But for the animation and art being good most of the time I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I think the sound was pretty awesome. It's not really memorable, but it set up a good scene sometimes. I absolutely LOVE the opening song, \"Arrival of Tears\" and the ending song, \"Sequentia\". Opening by Ayane and ending by Asriel. The opening really pulled you into the show and the ending song closed it off very well. For the opening and ending songs being so awesome, I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty boring but some of them were pretty interesting. Lets go through the list of characters...\\n\\n\r\nYukiko Hirohara - A minor character that disappears easily. I kind of like how when she takes off her glasses she's suddenly all dark and pulls out daggers. That was pretty cool since she's normally the bubbly hyper type. But if she's immortal, then wouldn't she know a little more about the Red Night if she's been around all this time?! That's the only thing that makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nKusakabe Misuzu - She's your typical \"I accidentally fell in love with someone who can never be mine.\" person. She's also your typical shrine maiden who can use swords. Nothing really cool about her but I swear at the end when Kakeru and her do that thing to get stronger? Yeahh I kinda wonder if that was just an act so she can just have sex. Also she's the one that does most of the work I think.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki Kakeru - You're typical main character who's the \"What? I'm just a clueless normal teenage boy! I don't have anything to do with this!\" type. He barely knows how to fight, and the thing with seeing the future with the golden eye under his eye patch, I wonder if he's secretly Raven Simone from That's So Raven. He doesn't do a whole lot, he just wants to protect Yuka, whom I would've given up on because Yuka gets VERY annoying.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana Kukuri - Kakeru's sister who shows up for a while but writes down everything she says because she can't talk. She committed suicide when Kakeru was younger and then she comes back as a ghost and she just kinda chills there no real explanation and no one really seems to care either. She has a cool attack with the chains and stuff but she's pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nMinase Yuka - She was originally typical girl who was being protected by Kakeru but after Kakeru and Misuzu start becoming close friends Yuka becomes a total creeper and stalks Kakeru and comes outside in her underwear all \"Don't you love me?\" and becomes VERY creepy and stalkerish and not to mention a beyotch. And her attack? Stopping those around her from using their powers. So she's very annoying.\\n\\n\r\nTajima Takhisa - Your typical angry all the time, food loving, \"I'm stronger than you type.\" Not much to say cause all he does is light his hands on fire and destroy stuff. Very boring and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is pretty stereotypical but some of their attacks are cool so I give it a four.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were boring parts, there were WTF moments, this is very awkward and weird, and I found some parts to be interesting. So I'll give a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6/10. It got some points because of the art and sound and the story and enjoyment being somewhat good. The characters were decent but it was a fair show. Probably never watching it again, since the anime isn't very memorable.",

            "content": "Very much wasted potential with this anime. Started out decently, with an interesting premise then devolved into something it never should have become.\r\nSo without further ado, let's begin...\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nWhat was an interesting, though not original, concept soon turned sour. At first it comes across as quite intriguing - what is the Red Night? Why are these kids transported into it? Why are they different? All this is answered, though I had to watch the last couple of episodes more than once to make sense of what in the world just happened. After the original introduction of the story, things take a turn for theworse, story-wise. It becomes more of a \"look how useless these females are in comparison to the male lead\" type affair and seems to discard actual logic in favour of butchering the other characters to make the lead appear better.\\n\\n\r\nWat?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nNothing special, just slightly above average. Caters to people who like the \"moe\" style females (big eyes and whatnot). The mirror world is just the normal world but red-coloured. Missing potential here I feel - could have been taken further as it was a decent concept. The black knights' design is pretty good, but poorly done. I found the fighting scenes awkward to watch for the most part, they seem pretty mediocre, as if not much effort was expended to make them awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the OP and the ED of this series. The OP sets us up for what could be an epic, action-filled 20 minutes, however at some points I enjoyed the OP more than the actual episode. Use of sound outside the OP and ED was nothing special really, it was mostly unnoticed by myself but managed to set the scene. Probably the best thing about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nReally obvious cut-and-paste archetypal characters. I think there is one of most of the -deres here, which annoys me to no end. Character development went out of the window when they decided everyone was useless except the male lead.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress, let me give character a proper review. At first it had the potential to be interesting. Kakeru and Yuka react to the red night with realistic confusion and fright, and have to be protected by Misuzu, a feisty swordswoman. There was potential here for a great character development, as I hoped we would see Kakeru fight to become strong enough to protect Yuka, which was his aim in the first place, helped by Misuzu. But, sadly, my hopes were too high and instead he suddenly becomes the strongest of the group, whereas the other characters who started out sort of interesting become a pile of quivering jelly in comparison.\\n\r\nThe devolution of the characters was the most frustrating part for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\r\nThe first little bit of the series was interesting for me. It's a relatively new concept for me personally, although it isn't original, I enjoyed how the characters acted and interacted. Then the frustration began as the series seemed to let go of any logical sense. Enjoyment gets a 6 - it started well, but the latter half of the series was difficult to enjoy a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nA lot of wasted potential in this anime due to bad writing and a very thin plot. The only real saving grace, for me, was the sound, and the first couple of episodes were decent.",

However, the lack of movement, or development is heart breaking.  The Regression of all the characters as a whole is deffening.  \r\nEach character has potential to be great, but is eventually used to support out (also potentially great) main character. However, all characters fall flat, and a flat balls holding flat tires is just useless.  The animation was poor, but the art was decent.

It started as a harmless innocent love story and transitioned in to a horrific tragedy. It\u2019s very similiar to Ousama Game. So don\u2019t watch both because it can be emotionally disturbing watching bloody kill scenes. I will delete entry from my list soon. It\u2019s true that shounen anime has kill scenes but they usually don\u2019t makeit gore. This anime has tons of gore. I admit I hate gore so it made it horrible to watch.

The hentai is was seinen if I were to rank it by graphic, but it was amazing because the senpai's hair was amazing as life! The only thing I disliked about this story is the fact that the main character is not a well made, like for instance he claimed to not feel anything kind of like tigress from kung fu panda, which concluded with that being a lie because of his sister complex, with his little sister* thing, it is quite weird, like they seriously should of just killed off that plain little loli girl, nothing against lolis but brown haired lolis are very common, which is why I only go for the white haired girl ending in the game because white haired lolis with a good romance are very hard to find only angel beats had a decent one, however that one is a tragedy, so I find it truly rare to find a loli that has white hair that actually gets chosen and does not die, because lolis are honestly the most adorable things in this world. However sadly his senpai is not a loli she is quite hot though she has flaming red hair, that is extremely long with a nice behind, she is quite hot, which is probably why the anime creator decided on having a master/disciple hentai scene, and not a senpai that is a kawaii loli which is honestly what we all want, because seriously alot of people do not understand the lolita complex which I find very weird.",

Where all the other humans have disappeared and monsters roam the streets.\r\n11 eyes us two main Characters Kakeru And Yuki. The Red Night Comes randomly and has the These two worried and baffled to why it is happening to them. They Later on find more humans that get stuck in the red night. And they all try and find the reasoning of why they get sucking into the red night. All the characters have magic powers somedo not know there\u2019s straight away.\\n\\n\r\nBetween the two many characters there is a annoying kind of Romance relationship. I\u2019ll protect you blah blah blah but never really seeing deep feeling for each other. I think that was a poor part of the anime and made it slightly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nFor Magic Fans the magic is pretty decent and can be exciting as you learn the powers of some and the powers the characters learn how to use them. Which makes for some good battles and interesting fights.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some Ecchi in the anime which made the anime more boring for mine. The ecchi in all honesty is not very good if your an ecchi fan don\u2019t watch 11 eyes for the fan service otherwise you will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI think 11 eyes is a good story a bit hard to explain without giving away spoilers. The high school students find they have rivals. Black Knights I think they were called. And slowly realise why they\u2019re rivals and the purposes of why they are in the red night and how they can defeat there rivals but also save themselves. There are some good scenes that keep you guessing and keep you on the edge of your seat. The Story isn\u2019t written quite well although it probably could of been so much better especially without the ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nSo for me I give it a 7/10 but also understand why some people would rate it poorly because it definitely isn\u2019t for everyone. But it\u2019s very much worth checking out the first few episodes at least if your thinking about it.\\n\\n\r\nKane",

The anime that makes you cherish the genre and make you reflect on your actions. That however, is not the case with this anime. No, it is the exact opposite. \r\n________________________________________\r\nThe Opening Theme is more exciting than the actual Anime\r\n________________________________________\r\nStory: The story is completely unoriginal and the plot... well there really isn't a plot. The main character is someone who has faced a tragedy and has gone into generic anime depression (the unrealistic type ofdepression that itou fell into in school days when no girl wanted to have sex with him any more) is suddenly forced to fight for survival with a poorly written yandere. The eventual climax of the story feels botched and miss represented, and the final 2 episodes will ultimate go down as one of the worst endings I've ever seen. One thing I've realized is that good anime don't leave their endings open ended. There may be some questions that still need to be answered, but the writers are practically begging to producers to give them more money to fund a sequel.  \\n\\n\r\nFor the love of god, no thank you.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, we have a generic main character with a \"tragic\" back story involving suicide. The problem is the suicide and the effects of the suicide are not even explored, we are just told that he is depressed and needs someone to help him. There have been anime that have been exceptional when it comes to exploring the theme of depression and suicide (A Silent Voice comes to mind as done Serial Experiments Lain), and there have been garbage anime that have done a decent job with it in the past when I have least expected it (Charlotte is the best example of a bad anime that somehow handled depression accurately), 11eyes just ignores that. Instead they turn this premise into a generic action anime with underwhelming fights, a weak climax, and a fake out ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I don't want to spend to much time on the characters because I feel like I would be insulting the producers if I did so. Its clear that the goal was to make everyone one dimensional and completely unmemorable. The main character is more bland than Otonashi and the supporting characters are archetypes you would expect to see in an anime with this low of a score.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound: The animation is this shows saving grace. While it wasn't anything special, it was pleasant to look at and helped me breeze through the series so I could get it behind me. The Opening Theme is amazing and was something that I could listen to over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Impact: Honestly I should have given this anime up. But by the time I was ready to throw this anime away, I was on episode 7 and figured \"why not?\" For me it did require a little dedication to get through, which is incredibly bad for a moe anime. The impact is there, but not in the way that the producers had hoped. This anime annoyed me more than anything, and that is the worst kind of feeling an anime can give you.\\n\\n\r\n________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nWith that all being said, here is how 11eyes stands in my scoring system.\\n\r\nPlot, Sequence, and Flow: 0.5/3\\n\r\nCharacters and their development: 0.2/2\\n\r\nImpact and Enjoyment: 0.4/2\\n\r\nVisual Effects and Audio Effect: 1/2\\n\r\nMemorability: 0/1\\n\r\nOverall Score: 2.1/10\\n\\n\r\nI have finished around 200 anime, and 11eyes currently holds a spot in my bottom 10.\\n\\n",

I'll try with no spoilers!\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe story can be considered unique and not unique in a sense of \"people are sent to a different world to fight\" although it has that aspect the following progression in which what they have to do in that \"world\" is unique. Development in the story is present as every episode makes you want to do an all-nighter since you want to know whathappens next. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Character Design was better than I expected since it's an Anime from 2009. It would be a 10/10 but I'm just being a bit petty. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSounds/Music and Voices fitted very well with the characters and settings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEvery character's personality fit their design and voices. I'm giving this Anime a very high score because of one of the characters, I don't want to spoil anything but I'll just say a certain someone makes the whole story very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis score is so honest. Every episode got wanting more and more and more. I even sat an all-nighter in a College day. (Which is today. p.s I'll sleep in class) The story was very gripping!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat Story. Great Characters. Great Sound. Very Enjoyable. Rated highly because it exceeded my expectations by a ton, I expected a normal \"boy saves the world anime\" and I am happy with the results.\\n\\n\r\nThank you!",

            "content": "There's a certain type of anime I hate to rate on here, the ones that start off god but have a terrible ending or last few episodes. What do you do? Do you rate them based off of the terrible ending, or do you ignore the ending and give it the rating you were going to give it before the show got bad? 11 Eyes is definitely one of those shows. \r\n11 Eyes is based off of a visual novel and it is directed by Shimoda Masami, who also did Saber Marionette J and the original Someday's Dreamers. It tells the tale of Kakeru, yourtypical high school student with a slightly dark past who lives a normal life with his clingy childhood friend Yuka. One day him and Yuka get transported to another world called the Red Night, where monsters begin to attack them. A little while later, they get transported back to Earth, however, they soon get transported back to the Red Night, and then go back to Earth again. They can be transported there at any time. . In the Red Night, they meet other teenagers who are also transported there, and they try to figure out what's going on while staying alive. \\n\\n\r\n11 Eyes certainty has a good premise. The fact that you never know when they could go into the Red Night adds a layer of tension to the show, as you never know when they could go there. They even got transported there during a comedic scene once. However, especially in the beginning episodes, they spend more time in the real world than the Red Night. Actually, this show starts out really really slowed paced. It takes until episode 5 for the last main character to be finally introduced. However, this slow-paced was welcomed, as 11 Eyes is not an action show first, but a mystery show, as these kids try to find out what's going on. And it can do that good. The show takes its time fleshing out its characters and setting, taking tiem to show that these are ordinary high school students and not just tools for the plot. The comedic scenes also work too and don't feel out of place at all either. Sure they aren't that funny, but they aren't painful to watch either, and they're dropped around the halfway point. When the show gets bad.\\n\\n\r\nWell, okay, maybe it's more of the two-thirds point where the quality really begins to drop, but still. The thing is, 11 Eyes is a 12 episode show, okay? But the thing is, the first 6 episodes were paced with the speed of a 24 episode show. While I love slow-paced stuff, around episode 8, the writers realized this. Chances are that the way they ended it needed 8 episodes to end properly, but they only had 4, so everything gets compressed and it is a mess. Multiple parts happens in one episode which each character doing something, which I typically love, but they don't know how to direct 4 plots going at once, making it tough to tell what's going on. Also, due to the fact they don't explain anything for a while, episode 10 is more or less one of the characters explaining all of the plot. Which is done badly and opens up so many holes in this show. Episode 11 doesn't really even have a point and can almost be considered filler when looking back. And episode 12, Oh my god. 4 minutes from the end I thought I was wrong about this show having 12 episodes and thought it had to be 13 the climax was that bad. Actually, this ending is my fifth least favorite anime ending, and I've seen a whole lot of shows with endings I hate. These final episodes were just so sloppily put together it's almost an insult.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the characters remain good throughout. Kakeru is your normal protagonist who just wants to protect his childhood friend Yuka. Yuka is well, the childhood friend of the clingy type, so clingy she turns yandere later on in the show which actually makes a little sense. There's also Kusabake Misuzu, your sword-wielding badass girl.  While they are 3 other main characters, they all appear rather late in the show that going over them would almost be spoilers. While most of the characters are built on your typical harem stereotypes, they are fleshed out well enough and grow out of their roles into multi-layered characters. They all develop nicely enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation. Well, it looks good for sure. The character designs are very cute and moe looking and look very pretty. However, it doesn't really move that fluidly. Characters typically stand in one place when they talk, the waving hair animation is looped and they just animate the mouth, typical techniques like that this anime is filled with. It's not distracting though as the character designs are really good, but still.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does have an awesome soundtrack backing it. The opening theme is rather catchy if a little generic sounding, and the ending theme is awesome with an unique sound to it. The backing tracks are also of a high quality and add to whatever atmosphere the show wants. The voice acting is very average too and I think Misuzu's looks don't exactly fit her voice, but it's still decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nStory- Great start, terrible last four episodes with a few noticeable plot holes- 6. \\n\r\nCharacters- Well-fleshed out for a 13 episode show and manage to stray away from their archetypes-8.\\n\r\nArt- Great character designs without much fluid movement- 7. \\n\r\nSound- Good opening and ending themes, good backing track, average voice acting- 8.\\n\r\n11 Eyes is a tough show to recommend simply due to the fact it really falls apart in the end. I give it a 7, and say watch it if you can handle the fact this show really derails in the end, as the rest of it is rather good. \\n",

            "content": "Story 7:  An anime with a story that involves mysteriously being transported to a another world and surrounded by monsters, while it does sounds like a well used initial premise, I found that in 11 Eyes it was necessary.  Comments on cliche's aside, I found the overall story to this anime to be good.  In a standard 12 episode anime, you would hope that the story is decent and not rushed and that's generally what 11 Eyes does.  This anime was my first real dive into a supernatural anime and the concept of the Red Night was one of my favoriteparts of this show.  The idea that you could be made to survive in a dangerous parallel universe at any moment in time was appealing and fun to watch.  The story's direction though was something I am split on.  On the one hand you had a brilliant set up that could've very easily made sense until completion but it was the sheer changes in direction towards the end that confused me.  I won't comment on what happened per se to avoid spoiling but let's just say the ending though it was explained, left me a little confused and perhaps wishing for just a bit more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm not the biggest art critic in the world when it comes to Anime but I will say the art in this show was great.  The thing that sticks out most for me was that awesome glass breaking scene that came up every time they went in the Red Night.  The cityscape, background characters and the entirety of the Red Night were pretty and served to make the sense of darkness/twilight greater when it was necessary.  The characters were all well done as well, my favorites being Misuzu and Kakeru.  Misuzu because of her eyes and expressions, Kakeru for his Aeon eye.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOk the sound in this anime is just fantastic.  Everything from the intro, to the ending music is just awesome.  I'm sure the other reviews list the names of the soundtracks but what I'd like to draw attention to is the amazing levels of contrast the sound selection offers to the feel and theme of this anime.  The juxtaposition of soundtracks with that almost aggressive feel using that electric guitar sounds so much better when it plays after the ending scenes in every episode.  It helped the show carry a tone of seriousness and kept me in anticipation for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs one who has mainly watched longer animes up until now, I will say the character development in this show was good given that it had only 12 episodes.  Granted a lot of animes have this standard of 12 episodes the characters in this show were all very unique with a few exceptions (YUKA).  I won't go over all the characters but the following three are highlights for me:\\n\\n\r\nKakeru:  Ok so he is the MC, he is the protagonist, etc.  That aside initially I hated his character for how cliche the whole orphan/alone in the world thing is.  As the series wound on I started tolerating him and eventually like his character.  While i wholeheartedly understand his unconditional care/concern for Yuka being a result of how much she was there for him as a kid, I always hated that no matter what crazy thing Yuka did, Kakeru still insisted on being with her.  What's more infuriating about this guy was how many times he had to repeat that he'd protect her and all that bravery crap.  6/10 for Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nYuka:  Alright so I hated this character.  If i had a delete button I'd use it on Yuka.  \"Why would you delete one of the main characters DisarmingStar?\"  Well ordinarily I wouldn't but Yuka went from clingy, weak and annoying to Clingy, strong, and crazy in a matter of two episodes!  Like i found her annoying at best prior to her becoming an obsessed maniac but my god that shift in character does absolutely nothing for me I still hate her!  \"So then why is Yuka a highlight?\"  That's because she does something very refreshing and that is stop being the damsel in distress and start being the crazy chick who gets her way!  In so many animes I've seen female characters start well and end up all weak, in others I've seen them just stay weak but not Yuka!  As much i hated her character the fact that she became a crazy chick and not some who gets weak around the MC was really nice to see 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu:  Ah yes my favorite character.  Here is a female character I like to see, well drawn, well conceived, a great backstory, wonderful voice acting, strong character (in design and in power) and she remains relevant throughout the entire anime.  Even though the show is called 11 Eyes I had no idea they'd do such a great job drawing the eyes for her and kakeru.  Her expressions combined with those deep eyes were very expressive and she just ends up being a really good character.  Granted eventually she too does fall for the MC, this is by far my favorite character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Maybe my rating for this is a bit high but this is my first supernatural themed anime and I liked it.  Granted im no expert on animes of this genre I say the plot was engaging and the characters' stories interesting enough to where I had a fun time watching it.  It had slight comic relief in the form of those two side characters which was very nice as some animes take comic relief way too far.  At the very least I was interested in seeing the next episode everytime i finished one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Look its an anime that's generally enjoyable and has awesome sound.  Some of the characters drive me nuts, others I think are awesome.  If you wanted a new anime to watch and didn't have a genre preference then I'd totally recommend this anime, its not that bad.",

            "content": "When I first decided to watch 11eyes, I tried to keep my expectations limited. However, the opening was incredible to watch and to listen to and the first episode definitely drew me in.  My high hopes for the anime soon faded by the last couple of episodes. They had a lot of potential, a great and fairly unique story and the characters were quite enjoyable, I felt as if the anime was cut short of a great story.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story also had the potential of a 9 or even a 10. The thought of an alternate dimension that was the demonic version of ourworld sounded like it was about survival mystery and could have been very complex. However, the story was not fleshed out enough and the development of the story went relatively slow. All except the end where there was suddenly some historical background information thrown at us at the last second. The plot was somewhat disappointing and predictable, as I was very disappointed in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say about the artwork but the fact that you could tell the animators undoubtedly put work in it. The graphics were great and the effects were well done as well but nothing overly spectacular. The colors matched the mood of the anime well and art was definitely one of the highlights to 11eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing I say will do the music justice in this anime. Watch the openings and endings and the amazing soundtracks and see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the plot, the characters had so much potential. However, their back-stories were simply thrown at it as we couldn't adjust to it long enough to understand these characters. Instead, at the end they unfortunately\\n\r\nbecame cliche and forgettable characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven to my disappointment at the end, the anime itself was good and was fun to watch. In the beginning and middle of the anime, the characters were fun and I nonetheless enjoyed it. The scenario they were in made the characters very interesting. However, of course, an ending could either make or break an anime, and this one not the worst but is very lacking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had great potential, but lacked a lot. My main problem was that it was too short and at least 24 episodes would be good. I hope for another season, but I really doubt it since it has been so long. Even through all my criticizing, this is in no way a terrible, let alone bad anime. It was enjoyable and the characters were fun. The soundtrack and graphics were unforgettable you'll definitely be humming it some time in the future. This is still an okay anime, and if you like supernatural anime, you may consider watching this. I make no promises though.",

            "content": "11eyes starts off as a stereotypical visual novel adaption. You have your male protagonist who has his own personal issues, the best friend who (not-so-secretly) loves him, and your secondary characters that introduce themselves several moments after the first climax. You also hear the \u201cI will protect you\u201d line played almost every episode in between the \u201cmake the useless male protagonist into a hero\u201d training scenes. In a nutshell, aside from the unique set up of the story, everything else is simply predictable and average. All of the characters, save for one or two, could have been generated from a cookie-cutter, but even that isnot a huge issue. What turned this average series into a disappointing one was Satsuki Kakeru and Minase Yuka\u2019s performance as the main leads. It made me cringe every time they stepped into the spotlight and it is difficult to enjoy a series when you despise the protagonists that much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself starts off with a fair number of questions. What is the Red Night? Who are the Dark Knights? What makes these kids so special? However, these questions are answered later rather than sooner. And when they are answered, you\u2019re left with more questions than when you started because of the \u201cunexpected\u201d twist they throw at you near the end. The ending can come across as either unique and satisfying or random and unexpected depending on how well you can accept the facts at face value. Unfortunately, I could not appreciate the ending because I felt its plot was poorly executed. It had a lot of potential in the beginning and even in the middle, but I could not get past the plot holes they left unfilled along the way.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the series as a whole seemed like a let-down, there are a lot of promising areas that kept my attention. Aside from the main love triangle, which was super awkward, I found myself focusing my attention more towards the other characters\u2019 relationships. The secondary characters all have interesting histories and stories that get revealed little by little each episode. The antagonists also have interesting backgrounds, though it is revealed way too late to mean much, but it does help show that their intentions are not just to be bad for the sake of being bad.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I am not giving 11eyes enough credit because in all honesty, it probably deserves more. However, I would not advise you to go watch it just to go looking for its good points since there is very little to find. As much as I tried to enjoy 11eyes, in the end I found myself watching the last few episodes for a sense of closure more than anything else. I watched it as a way to pass the time in between other shows\u2026 and trust me, it did not make time go by any faster.",

Well, this is intresting. Also, 11eyes have a lot of irony inside, while sometimes too obvious that it's a pain to watch. I personally don't like people who only doesnt' care about others unless they have what they want, and would do ANYTHING to get what they want. Also, the story had a very rushed ending (more on overall review).\r\nArt (8: Very Good): The Characters (including the male main character, Satsuki Kakeru)look hot and schmexy(ignore the \"chm\"). Although the Red Night may be just a color alternation of the original city, I believe that it took a lot of creativity to make the moon black and the night skies dark red. Also, Kusakabe Misuzu's swords are awesome. This isn't being sarcastic. those swords look about as good as Cloud Strife's Fusion Sword. They all have unique shapes and abilities, which kept me intrested in this anime (I am a sword freak)\\n\\n\r\nSound (10:Outstanding): The music is used very well, and it's really good too. Did you hear the opening theme (aka OP) of the anime? It has a christian (or not) choir theme, electric guitars (they are awesome.), and a japanese woman singing. Just like a fusion. The sound in 11eyes raise the suspense, and it fits really well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4: Decent): Although the characters may have been thought entirely by the character without any outside impact, this has a really similar character structure just like Clannad and Rozen Maiden.\\n\r\nSatsuki Kakeru     --> Okazaki Tomoya (looks, hair color, hero personality)\\n\r\nMinase Yuka        -->  Furukawa Nagisa (looks, hair color, personality (kind of, in a way that she only loves one person forever)\\n\r\nKusakabe Misuzu --> Sakagami Tomoyo (personality, the ability to fight well)\\n\r\nHirohara Yukiko    --> Ibuki Fuko (looks, height)\\n\r\nTajima Takahisa   --> Furukawa Akio (personality)\\n\r\nMomono Shiori     --> Ichinose Kotomi (looks, personality, item (books))\\n\r\nLisette Veltoll       --> Suigintou (looks, destruction personality) (Rozen Maiden)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8: Very Good): Since this anime is based off an 18+ Game, it had a lot of perverted scenes, which kind of shocked me, since this was actually the first H anime I ever saw without noticing. But now I'm fine, and used to the perverted scenes (yes I think I am a perv, woot!)\\n\r\nBut if this is not your first time watching a H anime, It would be much easier to enjoy at a faster rate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5+8+10+4+8)/5=7.4 (7:Good): Overall, I personally think this was a good anime, with all these problems, but I think it had a rushed ending, and the last boss (Lisette) was too easily defeated, since before she was first sealed, it took more than 60 black knights, but the second time, it took one girl, a boy with an Eye of the Aeon, and one Black Knight. At first, I thought that it would be hopeless when the two (Kakeru and Misuzu) fought Lisette, and when Kakeru was at the verge of death, Yuka would use her powers to break out of the crystal and nullify all violence, and when the two see a chance, they would capture her and send her to another dimension. but it was much more simpler than that. If there was just one more episode of the Good (The \"nice\" fragments and the black knights) fighting the bad (Lisette), this anime would have been much better. but other than that, everything was practically awesome. I can't sleep!!!",

            "content": "I started 11 eyes with the good feeling, it sounded interesting and looked like something I would enjoy. But I was also warned about how much of a trainreck some find it to be. I'm not the type to let other's opinions bother me so I kept a positive view. It's not the worst anime I ever watched, but I must say it didn't live up to my expectations.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThis was the worst part of the series. It showed strong potential in the beginning. But with most visual novels turned anime, it didn't live up to it's original work. The first half of the serieshas pretty much next to no development and the second half is awkward at best. You have to ask yourself the question \"What even happened?\" way too many times. In the end there were too many plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this is what bothered me the most. Normally I can watch any anime as long as it's somewhat interesting and makes sense. This didn't and I literally had to force myself through the episodes, watching 1 or 2 episodes and then putting it on hold. I hate dropping series and that's the reason I wrestled myself through this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't great, but not bad either. There wasn't much that really caught my eye. I did like how the characters sprung out, even when they were wearing their high school uniforms like all the time. Some battles scenes did look pretty awkward, the choreography was just terrible. Misuzu's sword summoning was the most interesting in this department.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda sad that this is the only department that's really good. I found the OP and ED really enjoyable and addicting. The BGM was great and does a good job at setting the atmosphere. There were some annoying voice actors under the girls, but hey which anime doesn't have at least one annoying VA.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nStereotypes, stereotypes everywhere. But that was still alright, until Yuka came around. She could crush this score singlehandedly. Even though she was clingy, she was still likable in the beginning. At the end of the series she was my most hated character. She just became way to annoying and I actually hoped she would get killed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the way how suddenly everyone regresses into powerless piles of fear. Even though they were sterotypes, the were still likeable. They had their own quirks until suddenly the Kakeru had to become the main point of focus and no one else counted anymore. What. The. Hell. Happened.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis gets a 6 at best. There were some parts that were interesting and the characters were still awesome till the second half. But as I said before, I really had to force myself to finish this. And that's not a good sign.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show had so much potential and it's sad to see how that turned out. The show is decent, but there are many better series out there. I really want to give the visual novel a try to see how the real experience would be. Please tell me the original work is better than this?",

            "content": "This. Anime. Is. Absolutely. SHIT. \r\nIt sucks. What can I say? IT FUCKING SUCKS! It has virtually no depth to the story, no character development aside from that bitch Yuka and the MC, and absolutely EVERYTHING seemed to revolve around the MC. At one point it was like he was the only relevant character; and yes, it is nice to have an interesting MC at times, but the side characters have to be of equal standing! And as interesting as they were, the show completely abandoned them for the shitty MC. \r\nWell, here goes. Keep in mind that this is most certainly a spoiler-free review,although it may hint at some things. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 3\\n\r\nTo be honest, I had to skim over the last few episodes because it was so bad, but from what I got of the story, it was a cliche mess. I mean, where have I heard this idea before? Even though I haven't even watched that much anime, I've heard of this concept many, many times before. While I do admit that the supernatural aspect added a nice flair to it, it was overall done in the wrong way. It just felt messy and forced, which is a horrible trait to have in an anime. I will say that I did fine the story of the MC and his sister to be somewhat interesting, but the anime revolved too highly around that lone aspect. I wanted to see some real depth and not forced depth, but I never got that. I'm pretty disheartened, to be frank. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 5 \\n\r\nThe art was alright- but quite frankly, it did look quite cheap. While it doesn't have to be anything fantastic like the animation from Shaft or Ghibli, I would appreciate if there was a little more effort put into it. Nevertheless, it looked alright; the character designs were pretty mediocre, but pretty and thus the art is no higher than a 5. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7 \\n\r\nI admit, the sound was good. The theme song wasn't the best but quite catchy, and while I never really listened to the ending song, it seemed alright from the first couple beats. The background music featured in this show was also quite nice and WOULD help to set the mood if the rest of the show didn't fail to do so. I do quite like some of the soundtracks here, and I'd like to see them put into other anime, although they weren't too special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\r\nOh my, the characters. Absolutely dreadful- I can't think of a word better-fitting, and thus I score this section a 2. While I won't give any spoilers, the characters were awfully cliche and bland. Most of them had little development and selling points, failing to capture the viewer's interest. This being said, the MC seems to highly stray from this category to the point where it's too much, and he becomes the only relevant character. At one point, everything seemed to revolve around him and the side characters became increasingly weak. The thing is, the MC wasn't even that interesting since the layers of his character were so messy, cliche and cheap. Really, absolutely awful work done on the characters here. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\r\nSNOOOOOORREEEEE. I had to speed up some of the episodes 4x and skim over the last few because it was just so utterly boring. It didn't have a nice tone to it, and it left a bad flavour in my mouth- even though I didn't exactly watch the whole series, it was a total waste of time. It lacked the suspense and drama that it attempted to bring, and that was where this anime really fell for me. I couldn't engage in it no matter how much I wanted to, and thus I rule it as complete shit. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3 \\n\r\nPLEASE, for your own sake, do not watch this anime. Perhaps newcomers might enjoy it as everything may seem fresh, but if you are experienced with anime and especially this genre, do NOT decide to give it a go.",

            "content": "What started off as something with a lot of potential quickly devolved into pointless amounts of ecchi - particularly underwear shots - and unneeded fanservice. The plot, which held by far the most premise, forgot itself a little past the halfway mark, and turned into complete cop-outs before the show was up.\r\nThe main character was fairly dull, and fell into the typical protagonist trope of 'I'm the main character. I'll have all the good shit!'. Though I'll give him his dues, he actually does start off shit, and then improves. Even if he did ruin everything for everyone.\r\nThere are good things though. The story islacklustre, but the art style is very fun, a couple of the characters are memorable and well designed, and the opening soundtrack ('Arrival of Tears' by Ayane) is a marvel. It tells you what the story's about, what to expect, and sets the mood, complete with a lot of energy and passion. Everything an anime intro needs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though... worth a watch at least. If you can overlook the many problems, and absorb the ONE GOOD PLOT TWIST, then you might even find it enjoyable. A solid 7, as far as I'm concerned.",

There are obvious signs that 11eyes is a visual novel adaptation like the cute female characters, butthat didn't seem to get in the way of the darker scenes that the anime tried to pull off. And the contrast between cute characters and the \"red night\" is actually quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for 11eyes doesn't necessarily stand out much, however they are not entirely forgettable and fit each scene nicely. The opening and ending songs are very addicting in my opinion, and I am proud to say that I am addicted to them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely where 11eyes falls flat. There is not enough time in 12 episodes to develop these characters that have obviously long and complicated backgrounds and the anime truly shows that. The character personalities are also painfully generic and they don't show much emotion despite the situation they are put in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes is fairly enjoyable, and to be honest I am being very generous in giving this series and overall 6/10, but it is not entirely horrendous. The show does not fail in at least creating some complications and exciting to watch scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\n11eyes is definitely deserving of harsh criticism and it shows the many problems that can occur during a light novel adaption, but it does not fall completely on its back. There are worse series out there. If anything 11eyes can be enjoyed as a short series to pass the time.",

            "content": "I have just finished watching the entire anime series of 11 eyes. This is how my experience with this anime ended up being.\r\nI started it up episode one and right off the bat i could tell that our MC in this show is going to have some kind of power with his eye. The creator of this made it obvious. Now the reason he has this eye and why it is important in the story I could not tell you. The reason I say this is I got bored/got lost in this anime. I was so intrigued at first but by episode 9 I waseither dozing off, looking at other anime I could be watching, or just fast forwarding the anime to find out either what's going on or trying to get to a part that is actually interesting. The character aspect of this anime wasn't bad except the lead girl. This girl is the love of our MC and started off as the cliche lovable anime girl. In about episode 10 i'd say this character's personality takes a complete 180 and for some reason becomes a yandere girl. The scenes when she is a yandere girl are so cringe worthy that it made it hard to watch. The final thing this anime pissed me off about was that in the end I had no clue what happened expect something cool apparently happened that made zero sense to me and then ontop of this the MC makes the worst decision of his little anime life.",

            "content": "11 Eyes (never really figured out the title), is a confusing story about a group of special characters (known as fragments) and their struggle to survive an alternate dimension that is triggered seemingly randomly (think like a fuzetsu in Shakugan no Shana with the randomness trigger of day dreams in Yumekui Merry).\r\nThe plot progression is very much like in Chaos; Head and Fate Stay Night where the main protagonist is thrown into a foreign, dangerous situation and is forced to adapt; and with the viewer being somewhat confused as the mysteries are slowly unraveled. The downside to this series is that it fails to pullin the viewer's interest in the early episodes (compared to Chaos; Head) and fails to deliver any semblance of a decent conclusion (compared to FSN).\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fairly serious series (not too much heavy fan service) with an emphasis on the sharp contrast between normal school slice-of-life and the unreal Red night. While the setting is eventually explicated enough, it is accompanied by a plot line that seems random at times and finishes off with a very annoying ending that isn't even worth spoiling.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a series, the review by roriconfan already contains lots of related anime, and all the ones I have seen on that review are better. If you must learn why this is utter fail, continue reading.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAnimation is probably the series' only saving grace. While not gorgeous, the animation is nicely done with decent character designs and average battles (there is significant blood in certain scenes). There is a large focus on dark colors (blood red) to complement the tone of the series. One annoyance is the hordes of very strange-looking creatures in the Red night (obviously deriving from the hentai...) that don't really serve much of a purpose, I found them distracting and utterly not worth the screen time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is fairly average stuff. OP starts rather interestingly but then becomes somewhat bland while the EP features a girl with crazy vibrato, but the melody just fails. Both fit well enough with the action-base of the series. The BGM is mostly forgettable with a techno-based theme during battles. VAs are average in this series (Daisuke Ono's usual humor potential is wasted on the boring main protagonist) but I blame the characters more than their respective VAs.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is where things start going really down hill. At least the premise is decent. You find a guy with one eye (other one is supposedly blind) and a typical girl next door that he likes, and suddenly they're transported to an alternate dimension and he wants to do everything to protect her yay.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately that's pretty much the end of the good news. The series then goes through many plot developments based off of way too many crazy explanations (completely unbelievable) to try to help the viewer make sense of what is happening (while still leaving huge plot holes unexplained). This is just way too much combined with characters that start behaving erratically (see next section) and just making a whole mess of something that originally had decent potential.\\n\\n\r\nExample: Person A dies at end of episode x, at beginning of episode x + 1 aha I tricked you A didn't die he/she was transported through a vortex that you didn't see just in the nick of time!).\\n\\n\r\nAnd like the previous reviewer I also greatly lament the pointless ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis series has greatly underdeveloped characters. A lot of times, the characters are unpredictable, as in they act in a way that isn't consistent with what you know about them at the time. The majority of the character development focuses on the guy (Kakeru) and the two girls interested in him (Misuzu and Yuka). As you can probably guess there is a bit of a love triangle and eventually one of the girls starts going coocoo. This seriously undermines any attachment a viewer might have with the character and leads to very unpredictable wtf moments in the plot line. Yeah they also decided to throw in a bit of an implied sex scene (though nothing to the extent of Yosuga no Sora) though it has absolutely no impact really on the plot line and makes a girl seem like a whore.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis pretty much takes the cake for being totally not worth your time. There are better girls with sword series, better action-thrillers, better cute-girl-in-distress, etc. While the series does play with a multitude of elements, they are just not integrated in a uniform, consistent package. Save your bandwidth and eyesight for something else.",

So I am going to review this anime on sections.\r\nStory: The story was really intresting, makes you eager to learn what is going on and what is going to happen next, but to speak truly, it wasn't that impressive.\r\nArt: The art style of the anime is a kind of exhausting, the colors make your eyes feel a kind of sick, but is totally fitting the anime. Probably there can't be any better art style choice for this anime.\r\nSound: Sounds were not that impressive, they were normal for an anime like this.\r\nCharacter: Thecharacters are not that interestig but with the story progress, you come to hate some of them, start to like the others. You start to care them about what will happen to them, so end up keep watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I want to make this clear, the anime is an ecchi and have erotic scenes, but I am not going to review these parts. Instead, the anime somehow stucks to it's topic and characters, make you curious about the future events in the story process. So it deserves to get a good compliment on this point, however it wasn't perfect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The anime is Very Good in my oppinion if I take a general look at it. You wouldn't say \"Ah, what an end.\" or \"Oh, this is what I call a perfect series.\" but also you can't say \"It sucks\", it has qualifications that every average good anime has, giving you a satisfaction that prevents you from thinking \"I just wasted my time watching this.\"\\n\\n\r\nI said to cut it short but seems like I failed. This review become far away from being short... I am putting the end by stating the anime was good and totally watchable, you won't have any regrets for watching it.",

Please do not misunderstand, the art style was what originally attracted me to the anime in the first place however, when I saw a yundere character was the second main character I was all the more excited.\r\nWhen I had researched the anime better, I noticed the reviews were not too awful so I gave it a shot but when I did, it felt like the story drained all the playfulness of anime and brought out too much seriousness. Even in the dark, twisted anime,the deranged character would at most enjoy his criminal behavior but this anime involved too many serious characters that were pretty hard to like. \\n\\n\r\nHere is a break down of what I could not get into:\\n\\n\r\n*Weak damsel in distress character= if only she actually embraced her psychotic nature\\n\\n\r\n*The main character agrees to ANYTHING= if only he was more decided\\n\\n\r\n*Love stories incredibly under developed= good luck.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall, I think what I was expecting was mediocrity but was still disappointed in the end.",

            "content": "This is an anime where the sum of it's parts isn't nearly as good as it should be. It was far from perfect, but I will say that I overall enjoyed it and think my time was well spent, even if there were missing pieces.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThis is really where the anime falls apart. This anime is produced from a fairly long visual novel (only available in Japanese currently) so it has a fairly long and robust story. Unfortunately, the anime doesn't do a great job of bringing over all of the details. I think with 2 seasons they could have made this anime great(as the VN is very highly rated) but due to the short and sometimes wasted time they didn't go into enough detail and often left the watched confused as to what/why/how. This lead to the story sometimes being a jumbled mess. Also, I HAVE to point this out... the huge retcon in the story... they should have just not done that and instead used that time to better explain elements and write a better conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt looks good. I like the character designs, the Crimson Night was badass and overall I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe overall soundtrack was good. The intro was badass, the music set the tone well. The emotional moments were heightened, the fighting scenes were enhances. A very good, even if slightly generic, soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the best and worst moments were held. The flashbacks from MC were meaningful and heartbreaking. The  development and emotional connection between Yukiko and Takahisa make you feel bad for them and make their fates very real. I haven't seen another anime since Mia-Hime that really made me feel bad for the characters and their fates. All of this is very good... then there is Yuka. Yeesh... yandere much? Totally out of the blue and doesn't fit all that well in the story. Then, of course, everything seems to work itself out and she is OK by the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime. I spent a fair amount of time thinking about how these things could happen, and why they were happening. Fortunately, there were enough emotional moments, nice artwork and interesting events to distract me from the random nonsense in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI went into this knowing it had bad reviews, but overall I think it was a \"fair\" anime. There is enjoyment to get out of it. Hopefully the VN will be translated to English some day, because the story is definitely worth a read in its entirety. If you're impressed with high quality art and music, and don't care to think too hard about the story, you will definitely find this enjoyable.\\n",

            "content": "11eyes is a fantasy action anime with minimal ecchi elements, in the usual done-to-death highschool setting. I hate ecchi, so I prepared myself with some booze expecting the worst. Despite my low expectations, this anime actually appeared to have a proper plot and a therefore reason to watch it. The start is slow and lacking but it picks up, so don't drop it early. Give this a try if you like this genre/type of story and don't mind a little ecchi. And even if you don't, then at least try the soundtrack which is the best bit. It really isn't half bad.\r\nAnimation\r\nWhen I started towatch this anime I thought it was made within the last few years, the animation quality is actually pretty good. The style isn't too unique, but one of the characters reminded me of a character from my favourite anime of all time. Very smooth and effective ation sequences. It seems to have a bit of a magic/horror style and reminded me of Shakugan no Shana at times. That's gotta be a good thing. This anime is tagged as ecchi and I'll be honest, I barely noticed much in the first half, besides a lot of tasteless unnecessary panty shots from Yuka. I swear that girl has a rip in the back of her skirt. The anime itself doesn't seem to have much of actual ecchi theme, though there has been the cliche 'girl groping other girls,' busty nurse and misunderstandings. No token beach or hot spring scenes either. A pleasant reduction in ecchi (besides those panty shots) and that's coming from someone who despises ecchi and hates out-of-context fanservice. Do keep in mind that I wasn't paying too much attention, the first half due to my inebriation however. I might have missed something like a bath scene or some potential bullshit, but there was barely any in the second half. The blood/gore is fine too, though nothing too extreme. May be a bad thing, but it could just be the look they were going for with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nDefinintely the best bit of 11eyes. I usually skip the intro/outro sequences after the first time, due to time constraints. But this time I really wanted to watch them due to the awesome music. Heck I ended up getting the soundtrack for this anime. This anime also utilises background music well and has great sound design. Sometimes there were scenes with creepy music, to suit the madness and other times there was beautiful instrumental for serious scenes. If the anime was a tad different, it could have been a horror anime, I swear. So, not being reliant on one genre of music and optimising the use of soundtrack is where this anime shines and it does it better than other anime that I've enjoyed more. This anime is only available in Japanese and the voice acting isn't too bad. So subtitles are required, since I assume we don't speak Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Kakeru Satsuki, of course a high school student and a bit of a badass. Especially with his eyepatch covering his heterochromic yellow eye, he appears more of a badass than the designated badass character. When he was younger, his younger sister was killed by some sort of demon. He appears to be romantically involved with Yuka Minase, who is his childhood friend. I should mention that this anime has the trope of having no parents or relative adult characters. He has a hidden power that he has not yet awakened and he wants to train and try his best to use his power to defeat the villianous demons who threaten him and his friends. Revenge could be a hidden motive. He also seems to be a tad unaware of how clingy Yuka is. Maybe needed a bit more development to define his personality better.\\n\\n\r\nYuka Minase is Kakeru's childhood friend and is infatuated with him. She is an orphan, taken in and raised by the non-existent but mentioned Minase parents. This girl is very clingy and obsessive over Kakeru, it appears she wants his dick so damn bad. I've heard complaints about this character and I'm not sure why. Maybe it was something I wasn't paying attention to in the first half or the thing that happens at the start of episode 11? Occasionally she peeks in on him, leading to misunderstandings over certain things. She is very worried that Kakeru would leave her. This character is also almost the sole source of ecchi in this anime, it really seems as if her skirt is ripped at the back or something. She is often oblivious to dangers due to her concern with everything Kakeru. She appears to dislike Minase as she is worried that she might steal Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nMisuzu Kusakabe is a swordfighter magic-user who is the latest in the line of the Kusakabe family. She has become solitary, due to extreme dislike from the other Kusakabe's for owning all of 4 legendary swords held by the family, having defeated and killed her own father for the last one and using the forbidden magic. She admires a magic-user that left 70 years ago, who was similarly hated. Similar to Kakeru, she has a concern for to righteousness. She also holds certain feelings... watch it to find out.\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment, I can't be bothered to talk about the less important characters. There is the girl/witch trapped in the crystal. The slutty nurse who appears to have a relationship with a student but turns out to be the guys adopted mother.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very much there and is fleshed out relatively well, with twists turns and unexpected developments too. By the way, episode 11 and 12 can be considered as two different endings, otherwise the story progression is bullshit. Behind it all, it is actually a romance story, with all sorts going on. Things actually happen and the story is relatively unpredictable. It is quite unique, with the exception of one other anime which is quite similar. There is an alternate reality called the Crimson Night in the city where the main characters live. Within this realm is a girl trapped in a crystal, the black knights who demonic beings that guard her and prevent her from being freed and other monsters. To free this prisoner and to protect the real world is the goal of the protagonists. It feels a bit complex and complicated at times. Overall the story starts off a bit slow, though that could just be the booze and as good as it is, it doesn't stand out enough and it isn't absolutely amazing. The ending is debatable and kinda disregards all of the plot events in a way. There isn't much to read into, so no social commentary/subtext here.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo, it ain't so bad after all. If you like the whole action/demons/magic idea, especially one where the story is great and things actually happen. I was getting very bored and distracted during the first half, though that was likely due to my drinking. If you hate ecchi like me, try this out since the ecchi is both frontloaded and rather minimal, so you should be fine with the overall anime. Not bad, not bad at all. I was wrong to get drunk for this one.\\n\\n\r\nFamily-friendliness Rating: 4/5 The panty shots are a tad extreme and there's a bit where she's wearing only kinky lingerie (lower is better)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10",

But, oh god was I wrong, this was terrible, 10 mins into the first episode and they throw all this random story at you with no explanation. Most good anime will throw random stuff in at the end of the first episode to draw in their viewers. But this anime just took off way too fast, and not in a good way. Maybe the plot get's better but I wontbe around to finish it.",

It didn't have to be so terrible, it really, really, really had the potential (as everyone has already said) to become a great anime! \r\nI honestly didn't mind the fanservice; But two things REALLY, REALLY hit this anime hard.  The Mood, and the Characters.  Few animes with the 'hopeless' or 'Ending' mood go mainstream. My Hime is one of them (My Hime or Mia Hime is in no way similair to 11E, except mood wise). \r\n (SPOILER)  If when they found out they were ACTUALLYthe good guys, they had become positive, instead of increasinly negitive, then the mood would have been much better (SPOILER END)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty good, good devel/ betwean each other, but eventually, they just faded into cries, and empty shells.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have time to burn, watch this, otherwise.

This lasted but a short time the more i watched the more i felt disappointed with the direction it was heading. The story was rather generic and pieced together jumping from one obscure plot to the next trying to follow a main story a few points though but had a new spin on which i particularly enjoyed. 11eyes  had a lot  potential i particularly liked the use of the title (nice touch) but that's about it. Each character felt flat and just pieced together persona that are similar to otheranime characters of this genre. There were a few plot twists that were straight up begging to happen from the fist episode which inevitably did. I had some enjoyment with the anime but overall it seemed rushed and never went in detail about anything just tried to tie the bits and pieces together. In reality the anime tried to cover too large of a story in too few episodes andi understand that it would require more time money ect.. as well as a fan base to try to make an anime longer but in terms of this it just cut out everything that could have made it wonderful and just released an incomplete mess",

            "content": "When I decided to watch 11eyes, I was really excited about the idea of several teenagers, each with awesome powers, joining forces to fight evil. And I was right to be excited about that. But there were other aspects that impeded my enjoyment and tested my patience with the series.\r\n11eyes turns out to be an awful, mushy and painful-to-watch love story between two of the protagonists. Basically, every episode, the two will say the exact same line, over and over again: Kakeru says \"I will protect Yuka,\" while Yuka just repeats Kakeru's name over and over...and over.......and over......................and over again. I suppose that this fallsin line with the plot, but I was hoping for something a little more original. The reason for almost all of the point deductions on the overall score were because of this.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I was still impressed by and thoroughly enjoyed their journeys to the Crimson Night, and the ways that their powers manifested and grew throughout the series. I wished that there would be more fighting and less talking, as this anime had very poor writing, and each of the attempted jokes fell flat on its face and then proceeded to writhe around, and wouldn't die no matter how many times you screamed at the screen (I'm pretty sure that works with other animes :P). \\n\\n\r\nIt is of my opinion that this anime is not a waste of time, but rather, not a productive way to spend time. Something along the likes of purgatory: not good, not bad. Certainly, the fighting is classic and pretty cool, but if you're more of a dialogue-oriented watched and hoping for some good humor or romance (as I presume most of us are) then 11eyes is a huge disappointment. \\n",

It intrigued me, and I was excited to see where it would lead. However, as the episodes progressed, it was getting more and more ridiculous by the second. Most of my beef is with the characters, which I will address later, but overall, the series just sped downhill after it's launch. \r\nArt: 7\r\nThe art was appealing to look at, definitely adorable with good looking characters. But there was little action. Nothing that really took my breath away with fight scenes,which by the way were sparse, or any other scenes. In fact, sometimes they looked downright awkward. I overlook this with the overall appeal of the scenes and characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nDecent. Actually, the opening theme was pretty good, I definitely enjoyed that. But nothing else that really particularly stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nOKAY. Now I loved the characters at first, I still do some of them. I loved Misuzu. I still do. But I couldn't stand the heroine Yuka, and later Kakeru, the lead male role. The other supporting roles had really interesting traits, characteristics, and talents which made me really enjoy watching this series. However, some of these characters and their total lack of judgement made me go totally insane. I greatly disliked Yuka. And I really don't like hating the lead female role. It irritates the hell out of me but I wanted to reach through my computer screen and pull her out of that series. It ruined the series for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThere were some really weird things going on in this series. Certainly not conventional. It was a littler eerie and kind of weird. Really tok away from the enjoyment of it. I didn't like the ending, had to force myself to bear with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI stuck around long enough to finish it so I can't say it was totally horrible. It still had interesting potential that was intriguing to watch. I'd recommend it if you don't mind weird twists that's a little dark. It's just not the series for me.",

            "content": "The studio in charge of 11-Eyes (Say, Marvelous Entertainment) is commonly known for its stories who can surprise at the same time that give you goose bumps, either it is for its involving plot (Mushishi, AKB0048), easy to hate characters (Ichiban Ushiro no Daimao, School Days) or just for poor execution of the plot, characters\u2026 and everything else. Unfortunately, that\u2019s exactly the case we have in hands today.\r\nMeet Kakeru and Yuka, two childhood friends who without knowing why, end up in a world where the sky is red, and the moon is black, the streets are filled with rampaging monsters and the danger awaits inevery corner.\\n\\n\r\nNot knowing what to do know, they start they quest to get out of this dimension, but, as fast as it came the \u201cRed Night\u201d ends up again and, SURPRISE! There are 4 other people who also where there, little did they know that this red night gats them powers, such as legendary sword casting, killer instinct, and pyromancy.\\n\\n\r\n4 episodes into the series, knowing close to nothing about the characters, they start to fall in battle with the Black Knights, who as the antagonist of the series, start to kill the main characters, one by one, always with time to yell to our heroes to hand over the fragments, but never with time to explain what they are, or why they want it\u2026 or even why they are attacking.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this there is little room to character development, leading to forced relationships, decent action scenes who, though entertaining, doesn\u2019t add anything to the overall plot (most of the times), and feel like time fillers.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art, and soundtrack there\u2019s nothing outstanding, thought the music is well related to what\u2019s happening in the scene, with all the nonsense yelling, you can barely notice the music. And when you realize there is music, is in scenes so boring and out of context that is just distracting.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 4\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound Track: 6\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n",

            "content": "I myself didn't enjoy this anime particularly. I felt like while they were doing it they were running out of ideas. The only good thing about this anime is the ova episode because it is so overtly sexual that is hilarious. The show goes through its paces as any other would, but the twist at the end, the pivotal point of the show could have been solved in the very beginning with an admission of details that had been kept to oneself. Just at the least go ahead and watch the ova, its hilarious.",
