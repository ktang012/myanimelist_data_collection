            "content": "For many of us who watch anime, the medium can become something more than simply animated entertainment. Sometimes, we will find ourselves connecting on a deep emotional level with a character or characters in a show. Sometimes, the story will seem less like a fanciful escape and more like a reflection upon society or our individual lives. These are the kind of shows stick with us. They'll make us laugh, they'll make us cry, and sometimes they'll make us realize something new about ourselves. Honey and Clover is one of those kind of anime.\r\nBased on the manga by Chika Umino, Honey and Clover follows thelives of five fledgling artists and their journey through the exciting and simultaneously terrifying world that we know as college. Through the eyes of these five students and observe them them growing, affected by the years of challenging experiences through which they have gained many cherished friendships and also come to know the agonies of unrequited love.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of the series is the animation. The bold, hard lined style you see in most anime will not be found here. Instead, animation studio J.C. Staff takes a wholly different approach by using a faded watercolor palette and soft sketched character designs. The style may not appeal to everyone, but it best reflects the true nature of the characters and their setting. Aside from the color palette, the animation goes through various perspective changes so subtly that it can even make the simple shot of a single character interesting. In essence, it is like art in motion.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the audio needs to work hand in hand with the visuals and Honey and Clover has quite a robust soundtrack. Many of the insert selections worked well to heighten and sharpen the on-screen emotions. However, not all of the songs fit each scene like a glove and at times it felt like maybe there might even be too many songs they had tried to fit in. Despite that complaint, the songs themselves were all very good, even the instrumental tracks, and &ldquo;Waltz&rdquo; may hands-down be one of the best ending themes of any anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that may be universally agreed upon about this series is that the characters definitely make the show. Honey and Clover, like many other slice-of-life series, falls back on the characters to help carry the series and all five of the main characters do so phenomenally. Throughout the series, the perspective changes so that we see, hear, think, and occasionally feel what any given character is going through at that time. Depending on a viewer&rsquo;s past experiences in college or even just life in general, certain characters will become more appealing and easier to relate to than others. Someone who has never been torn between someone they love and a close friend who loves them will have a hard time relating to a character like Mayama. Also, while a character like Takemoto may be more accessible to the male audience, Ayumi may be a better focal point for women.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing to realize is that just about anyone who watches this show will find a character who they can directly relate to in some way or another. From Takemoto&rsquo;s indecisiveness about his own life, Morita&rsquo;s slacker appeal and almost unfair success, Hagumi&rsquo;s torn desire between being a success she&rsquo;s not proud of or a failure she can live with. These are not just character struggles, these are struggles we all go through and we begin to see these characters as our friends and companions as we make our way through our own ordeals.\\n\\n\r\nAs said already, Honey and Clover is a slice-of-life series, which means it could take place anywhere at anytime with anyone inside the world as already is. It is a balanced and yet lively blend of romance, drama, and comedy without going too overboard on any single element, much like life itself. The story moves forward very quickly, skipping weeks, even months at a time between episodes. This could be viewed as slightly unrealistic as viewers may believe the characters should change faster than they do. Regardless, the character development is there, and does proceed at a realistic pace relative to the length of the series. Though the ending is inconclusive, those who enjoyed it to the end can take solace in knowing a conclusive second season awaits them to tie up all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like how Azumanga Daioh is called &ldquo;the anime you should watch if you&rsquo;ve been through high school&rdquo;, Honey and Clover is the anime to watch if you&rsquo;ve been through college. Graduates who watch this will probably feel a good amount of nostalgia. At the same time, those of us who haven&rsquo;t been through college or are still going through it will enjoy a realistic simulation of where we might be going and how we might deal with it. By empathizing with the characters and relating to them, you&rsquo;ll come to see Honey and Clover as more than an anime; It's a life experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&quot; club.

            "content": "Ever get that nice feeling after you finished watching a really good series? That&rsquo;s how I felt when I finished watching Honey and Clover.\r\nWhat a wonderful story. It&rsquo;s a good mix of bittersweet growing pains, salty teardrops, and huge doses of soul searching, all brought about by Love. Ah yes, Love. That is what defines the plot of Honey and Clover. Through this anime, we see how love can go both ways &ndash; it can send you flying in the sky, or it can leave you with a knife in the back.\r\nI can relate to mostly everyone in the story, and this is also whyit was so easy to understand for me. Yamada&rsquo;s frustration over unrequited love, Takemoto&rsquo;s fear of the future and time quickly passing by (believe me, time in this anime is fast-paced), Hagu&rsquo;s feelings of pressure from everyone around her, and of course, the loneliness that everyone felt from time to time. The ability to relate to each and every one of the characters made Honey and Clover such a good watch for me, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be the same for everyone who will watch this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite the serious tones, there are still moments that are quite funny. Most of the comedic relief comes from Morita, who is actually one of my favorite characters. His idiosyncrasies are what made him great to watch. I love that scene where he accepted the Mochademy Award (A nod to the Academy awards) for best CG. There was also this great episode where Morita and Takemoto played some sort of twister game until their limbs were intertwined. Of course, you can&rsquo;t forget chapters L and F which were both funny as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters because they were all so relatable and they were all managed effectively. At the end of the series, you know everything that goes/went on behind their facades. They all had well thought of histories and wonderful unique personalities that go so well together. It&rsquo;s almost like an anime version of FRIENDS. I already mentioned that I like Morita, but my other favorite is Mayama. I kinda developed a crush on him too; I actually see what Yamada sees in him. I was kind of annoyed that he picked that old hag Rika over Yamada. I really hate that woman; she&rsquo;s only out to hurt Mayama. I&rsquo;m definitely on team Ayumi &ldquo;Tetsujin&rdquo; Yamada (Even though she tends to ramble on a lot)!\\n\\n\\n\r\nDrawing style was something new. It reminded me of old school anime with a new twist. It had the same look and feel of 80s anime with except it was updated and fresh. It was probably because of the coloring technique - the colors were just lovely, they weren&rsquo;t vibrant, like how I usually would like colors to be, but they were done well and the colors didn&rsquo;t clash, so I actually liked it. It reminded me of water color paintings, a trend I noticed from watching JC Staff series. Usually the illustrations are done well, they barely change or if there are any changes it goes unnoticed. Although I did notice a huge shift in Hagu&rsquo;s appearance &ndash; She was a lot prettier in the first episode compared to the rest of the series. Her look was done well though &ndash; she had beautiful eyes and hair (same thing with Yamada).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were different animation techniques that were used. I like the use of stop motion, I&rsquo;m guessing the first opening theme sequence was made using stop motion and clay figures. There was also the use of live action, which was for the second opening theme sequence (The poodle was just adorable). Some scenes had a more weathered look, and there was even an instance were vector art was used. Of course, there was the use of CG. CG is always good if it&rsquo;s used to give depth to animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was actually pretty good. My favorite seiyu for this series is Tomokazu Sugita, Mayama&rsquo;s seiyu, who was also the seiyu for Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, another favorite of mine. I also like Morita&rsquo;s seiyu, Yuji Ueda. I think it&rsquo;s funny when his voice turns soft. The other seiyus, such as Keiji Fujiwara and Mikako Takahashi were already familiar to me, since I&rsquo;ve watched/currently series they worked for before, and what they did for Honey and Clover were splendid as well, but as for Hagu&rsquo;s seiyu, I&rsquo;m a bit indifferent. Based on the information I saw about her, she seems to be a newbie (I think she&rsquo;s only 18) and Hagu Hanamoto is probably her most notable role. Anyway, everyone did a good job because they brought out their character&rsquo;s personalities really well, and the dialogues were easy to follow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m surprised that most of Yuzo Hayashi&rsquo;s work was for Sailormoon. I actually thought the music for this anime was done well &ndash; everything was modern and contemporary. I like the wide variety of insert songs that were used as BGM, and of course, the opening and ending themes weren&rsquo;t bad either. At the end of the series I found myself humming and bopping my head to the catchy music of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness for the second season, plus the extra two episodes. If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I Probably would be close to tears by now. This is undeniably one of the best series (Thank God to no fan service!) I&rsquo;ve ever watched, and will watch again.",

            "content": "Almost everything about Honey and Clover is unprecedented and perfected. From the unnerving OP to the moving ending narration, each episode is a dramatic and romantic take on the special lives of the six main characters. There is no action and there is no fanservice so the stereotyped teenage male audiences will avoid this series, however, the intelligent humor and very intricate intricate character development which dominates the show is sure to satisfy most mature fans who are sick of slapstick, perverted anime. At times it does get very similar to American soapies but I believe that Honey and Clover outdoes any love triangle stories.Each character goes through their frustrating situations, which don't seem to conclude detailed enough. The angelic Hagumi tackles her self-esteem issues, Mayama chases after Rika who is still mourning over her late boyfriend, Ayumi fights her depression after being repetitively rejected by Mayama, Morita (who provides for some of the best comedy I've seen in anime) tries to deal with his own expectations of life, Shuuji devotes himself religiously to the welfare of Hagu, and Takemoto attempts to escape out of the banal life ahead of him. These complex characters see the most impressive explorations of life, romance and personal fears. At times there is some repetition in the plot and it may seem a bit predictable, but there really is no competition for the best josei anime around. Recommended to anyone who wants to experience the reality of love or to be inspired and have a little cry at the end. Top notch anime 5 stars.",

            "content": "Title: Honey and Clover\r\nManga, Live-Action Adaptations, Anime: Honey and Clover was originally a manga created by Chika Umino.  It began its run in Sueisha's CUTiEcomic maganize in June of 2000, and swithced over to Young YOU in July of 2001, and ran there until the magazine's demise in 2005, and finished up its run in Chorus in July 2006.  The manga stands at ten collected volumes, and has been licensed Stateside by Viz's Shoujo Beat label; the first volume will be released on March 8th of this year.  Honey and Clover also won the Kodansha Manga Award for best shoujo manga in2003.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover also has two live-action adaptations to its name.  The first is a live-action movie adaptation that was released on July 22nd, 2006 in Japanese theatres.  The second is a live-action TV drama that started airing on January 8th of this year.  Neither has been licensed Stateside, and neither will be covered in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation was 24 episodes long, and was produced by JC Staff (famous for their work on Revolutionary Girl Utena and Excel Saga) and directed by Kenichi Kasai (famous for his work on Nodame Canabile).  It ran on Japanese TV from April 14th to September 25th, 2005.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Honey and Clover follows the lives and relationships of five college students -- Mayama, Takemoto, Morita, Hagu, and Ayu over a period of about five years.\\n\\n\r\nIt was really hard for me to get into this at first.  For the first four episodes, I liked what I was watching, but I didn't really feel the pressing need to see what happened next.  However, this changed in the next few episodes, mainly because everything had been more or less established, and they started developing things.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who are in college and watching this are going to be stunned at the realism of this.  It feels like these characters could very well be people around you, and the situations they're in could be things you or your friends are going through at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, there's no overlying plot.  However, unlike KamiChu, this isn't a problem, mainly because the characters and their relationships are developed well and are the actual center of the story, not driven by some cardboard cutouts and a crappy problem-of-the-week plot.  Also, there's a lot of fairly obvious metaphors and some crazy-ass humor that make the show even better.  ^^\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are going to be some who are depressed at the rather open ending.  However, there is the second season (Honey and Clover II), which I'm going to be starting shortly and will eventually review.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Absofuckinglutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe background is done in what looks like watercolors, so it's kind of hazy and washed-out, similar to what you see in Potemayo's backgrounds.  The character designs are a blend between the typical anime design and a more manga-esque look.  They also have the budget to change clothes at least once every episode.  SD is very common when tied in with the crazy-ass humor, which is just made of WIN.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this combined serves to make an absolutely beautiful series.  It's up there with Gankutsuou's visuals, but not quite that extreme.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is w/r/t Hagu's character design.  Yes, I know that you want to emphasize that she's a bit sheltered and innocent, but really, she looks like my youngest sister, and you're trying to pass her off as 20?  Work on that for next season, plz.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Honey and Clover's background music is a little odd, but it's amazing at the same time, because they use vocals in a way that I've only heard Bobby McFerrin attempt up till now.  There's also a piano version of either the OP or ED that plays a lot in the series, and is just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover also uses a lot of insert songs; there's at least one every episode, and they're perfectly fitted to the moments that they're played in.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is just annoying.  I mean, the animation for the first version was absolutely amazing (food + claymation = AWESOME), but the vocalist is kind of shrill, and makes me cringe.   The EDs didn't particularly stand out, but they were nice.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Morita's seiyuu played Takeshi (Brock, for us Americans) in all the seasons of Pokemon, and Hakim in Victorian Romance Emma and Shuuji's seiyu was in Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ and in FFVII: Advent Children as Reno, which was fairly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all the other seiyuu did an excellent job, as ever.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Twenty-four episodes was a good length; the manga material does go further, and I guarantee that by the time you're finished, you will want more, but the second season should cover that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A beautiful, realistic slice of college life with excellent music and some fairly good seiyuu.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of my top picks.  See this.  NOW.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 46/50; 92% (A)",

            "content": "Honey and Clover is a romance series created by manga artist Umino Chica. In 2005 it was adapted into an anime in 2005 by J.C. Staff. The same studio responsible for Nodame Cantabile and Aoi Hana, which is somewhat promising. As well as Shakugan no Shana, which is pretty discouraging. The only way to see whether this stands with their good romances or their creepily codependent rubbish one is to watch it. So let's check it out. \r\nThe story opens with our protagonist, Izaya (yes, I do know that's not his name, but the characters in this were so dull I never learned their actualnames, even over the course of 24 episodes, so I'm going to refer to them by the names of more interesting characters played by the same actors) anyway, Izaya is spending some time at his apartment with a couple seniors from the same art University, the studious Chrono and the held back slacker, Jean Havoc. Reno, their teacher, brings in a young relative of his, Sayu. The story from their focuses on their everyday lives with particular emphasis on the love triangle involving Izaya, Havoc and Sayu or Chrono's unrequited love for the older Ridget while he tries to deal kindly with Amy's unrequited feelings for him. The biggest problem with the series is just that it's mind numbingly dull. It relies on you caring about the mundane lives of the characters, more on why that doesn't work in the next paragraph, although I'm sure you can figure it out. Most of the story focuses on soap operaesque romance elements and not the entertainingly cheesy type of soap opera in which the main character's evil twin has an affair with his mother-in-law and she thinks it was him or some such absurdity. This is the more mundane variety in which the situation is ordinary but over-blown. In addition to that, everything drags. There's a long scene about the characters looking for the interesting plot ideas... I mean a four leaf clover. The scene ultimately has no impact on anything else that happens either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are bland and one-dimensional. You'd think that a series with a clear character focus would take some time to flesh its characters out and develop them, but Honey and Clover has no time for such things. Instead, it picks a focus trait for each character, whether they're childish, uncertain, slackers or whatever and it never lets them grow or deviate from that. The biggest example is Havoc who gets an easy opening towards the end for some mild development only to elect to remain within the status quo because... developing slightly would interfere with his one character trait. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is... okay. The  faces are drawn kind of oddly. They always look like their mouths are open. The scenery is fine. One thing that is odd is that Sayu's supposedly brilliant art is just incredibly mediocre. It could be a deliberate statement on how mediocrity frequently does get praised as \u201cbrilliant\u201d for inexplicable reasons, but its more likely that they were trying to make art that looked brilliant and that's what they came up with. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is passable. The actors certainly don't give their best performances, but they also don't have much to work with. They still all manage to do their jobs adequately. The music tends toward the soft and peaceful. It functions for the show's aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 2/10. Havoc gets some homo-erotic scenes and there's one rather disturbing scene involving two brothers. The strangest part of that scene is that it has absolutely no purpose nor is it mentioned again. They could've left it out and lost nothing. So... they deliberately hinted at incest for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover is not a bad anime. It's just boring and, mostly, inoffensive. It feels like a creative writing project from a student who's about to graduate and doesn't care anymore. I can really only recommend it if you really like watching dull people go about their lives or you're suffering from insomnia. It may very well bore you to sleep. Final rating, 5/10. Next week, Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro Chan. I know, it's not the first thing in the queue, but everything else is too long to finish in one week.",

            "content": "Note: This review pertains to both Honey and Clover and Honey and Clover II, since II is a direct continuation of the first series.\r\nWhat do you want to do with your life? Where do you want to go? How will you get there? What brought you here in the first place? Honey and Clover, a slice of life josei anime, addresses these types of questions. It tells the story of five friends in an art college and their lives and relationships throughout college (and some of them beyond that) as they face various obstacles. The show does a masterful job at exploring the lives andpersonalities of these five students and the people around them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I used to prefer shows with super captivating plots where there are distinguishable heroes and villains, Honey and Clover changed my views on that. There isn\u2019t a grand overlaying plot to this series, and yet somehow, I was just as enamored with it as those other shows, if not more. The characters are just regular college students trying to make the most out of those precious years while searching for direction in their lives. They don\u2019t have incredibly bleak pasts, though they\u2019re not without their troubles. Each character has various predicaments that most people would face in that stage of their lives. Takemoto, the protagonist and narrator, is surrounded by highly capable, successful peers, while he seems to be the  most \u201caverage\u201d of his friends. He is the most directionless of the group, unsure of how to proceed after college. He quickly falls in love with Hagumi, an extremely talented painter who has body of a child. Despite her abilities, she is shy and suffers from childlike social anxiety. Then there\u2019s Morita, the most eccentric one. Though he appears to be manipulative, greedy, lazy, and just plain odd, he is surprisingly one of the wiser ones of the friends. His life outside of school is mysterious, and he often has long periods of absences where he inexplicably wanders off and comes back with only a large wad of money and extreme fatigue. We also have Mayama, the first to graduate and get a job, who harbors feelings for a disabled woman who\u2019s had a dark past in regards to relationships. Finally, there\u2019s Yamada, who is in love with Mayama. Even though he constantly rejects her, for some reason, she continues to try.\\n\\n\r\nLike in real life, these aren\u2019t static characters. They\u2019re dynamic. They learn through experience and their mindsets slowly change, for better or for worse. It\u2019s interesting to see them develop this way, as we learn about their pasts and their predicaments.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, although the plot may seem simple enough, this isn\u2019t a straightforward anime. Through its storytelling, it poses several questions and concepts for the viewers to mull over. It teaches us to reflect on our lives and see what brought us to where we currently are. We must cherish the memories with our friends, but eventually, we will have to move on to the next phases of our lives, in which, often times, we will have to depart from our comfortable lifestyles. This is depicted by the constant image of a wheel turning, symbolizing that we must continue forward and adapt. Time is continuous, and thus so is life, and while we should definitely reminisce, we have to live in the ever-changing present instead of in the past.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you\u2019re not into shows that really examine human emotions and relationships, don\u2019t be turned off by Honey and Clover. The show does an excellent job of mixing comedy and drama. On a mere superficial level, this show is hilarious, filled with memorable scenes, most of them brought upon by Morita. You don\u2019t have to indulge in the deeper scenes to enjoy the show. Even if you don\u2019t like the drama, the comedy is more than satisfying enough to be a reason to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, it has a softer feel to it than most other animes due to its watercolor palette. It\u2019s very soothing and natural, and definitely an enjoyable departure from modern conventional animation styles. The music fits the moments well, and while I don\u2019t usually pay attention to OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s, I\u2019ll admit there were a few ED\u2019s I liked that really added to the ending scenes of various episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a realistic depiction of life. It tells a story of unrequited love, overcoming obstacles, acceptance, and ultimately moving forward. We\u2019re able to connect emotionally with the characters, empathizing with them, because most of us have been in situations similar to theirs. It\u2019s not quite tear jerking, but there are definitely many touching scenes that will make your heart feel heavy. Honey and Clover truly is one of the most beautiful and introspective series I\u2019ve seen. It is a simple, yet profound, story about life.",

            "content": "Honestly I only came here because I have only written positive reviews so I felt like ranting about an anime that I thought sucked that apparently every other person on the planet loved. \r\nHoney to goddamn Clover...fuck. Just typing the name irritates me. This review will be short and contain LOADS OF SPOILERS, so stop reading if you do not want that.\r\nAnyway, this whole anime for me was one giant what the fuck. \r\nSo I love romance anime, but I kind of only want the romance anime to go well, which may not be a great trait to have but oh well I'm a sapfor happy endings. OF WHICH THIS ANIME HAS NONE!\\n\\n\r\nSo you got this guy Takemoto, immediately falls for this 8 year old girl who, surprise is actually like 20-something and an art prodigy attending his college. My dude Takemoto is the nicest guy in the fuckin world! And he gets NOTHING. NOTHING I TELL YOU!\\n\\n\r\nSo he is just being his chill self, helping Hagu, or whatever tf her name is, get accustomed to life and the school and everything and she's like \"oh thank you I really appreciate it.\" And here I am thinking \"Okay my boy gettin that 8-year-old-lookin puuuussssss\" \\n\\n\r\nBut then she sees this guy Shinobu's sculpture or some shit like that and meets him for the first time and BAM, she's in love with him. Shinobu falls in love with her too like instantly and thus the love triangle is established. So what happens next? Shinobu disappears for like 2 months (pretty sure I'm being over dramatic here but it was a long time).THE WHOLE TIME, my bro Takemoto is still being the best fuckin' friend to Hagu, doin' everything for her. Helpin' her when she's down. AND SHE GIVES NO FUCKS ABOUT HIM!\\n\\n\r\nThen Shinbou comes back and Hagu is all about him and they kiss and it's bullshit. Then at the end Takemoto is like \"I'm moving because I'm super depressed thanks to you guys, fuck all yall\" and they are just like \"Who tf is Takemoto again?\"\\n\\n\r\nSeriously this dude was so poorly treated. I have never seen someone go from Goku to fuckin' Krillin so quick. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is this other love story between AGAIN this really supportive, amazing girl, and this dude who's in love with his terminally ill boss or something. EVEN THE BOSS IS LIKE \"Dude, this chick is amazing and wants you so bad and supports you so much.\" And he's like eh, fuck her. \\n\\n\r\nI said this would be a rant and I got pretty into it by the end there. Anyway, TL:DR,\\n\\n\r\nThe characters treat each other so fuckin shittily and in the end it's one of those \"Everyone was happy because they realized how important friendship is and they all got closure\" Oh bull-fucking-shit. Takemoto probably offd himself a week later, and everyone else was still probably depressed because nobody ended up with the person that they were in love with. \\n\\n\r\nOh, except the chick who moved on from the dude in love with the terminally ill chick. THAT GIRL WAS THE ONLY SANE ONE! And she was the only reason I kept watching. Fuckin; hated Hagu man...hated that bitch.",

            "content": "Honey and Clover is one of the few slice of life series that deals with matters such as love and friendship very maturely, the everyday life quite realistically and the resolution with a better perspective. \r\nIt is hard for me to decide to give this show a number. With little bias in mind, with the satisfaction I received, with the delightful sound tracks, it is easy for me to give this show a 10. And my advice is, don't look at the numbers, but actually understand the wonderful story the show has to offer, the beautiful story where the little things in life are highlightedas we glance through the life of these college students, mainly Yuuta Takemoto. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses gradually as we move further, with blurry episodic start followed by some more deeply curved story and something much more seriousness. Life as student can be difficult for many, due dates and demanding qualities, things are much more complicated for art college students. However, even with their hardships, poverty as students, and love that is almost dream, the protagonists enjoys their little time they have, the time they have together. Teasing and praising, the protagonists are very likable, and for many, relatable. The triangles of love, the unrequited feelings, and the painful evenings are all that the story includes. Within the funny atmosphere, the story is heart-warming and sometimes very aspiring. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, they develops through the series. Their collaboration, their silent feelings, their goals and emotions, their dreams, the story explores them all. Friendship to put over love, considerng the other end, and the honesty the characters give makes it impossible for me not to praise them. It is a wonder how smoothly the characters blend together. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound are one of the stronger parts of the show. Almost every episode contains one song to accent the emotion along with the superior soundtracks. The strum of the guitar, the soft piano sound along with the calm melodies, the music does a excellent job at uplifting the mood. The opening is decent, but becomes more meaningful the further the story goes. The first ending, Waltz, is probably one of the best ending music I've heard in anime, and by best, I mean how perfectly it fits and portrays the show. The second ending is quite mediocre, but fitting near the end. Voice acting for the show was likable, calm voices, good laughs. But at some point, one may find the emotional scenes are quite exaggerated. \\n\\n\r\nArt. The art is not heavily detailed, not exaggerated, not eye-candy. The art is simple, soft, and intended for a softer approach. The serious scenes are drawn with care, and given finer details whereas the comical scenes are less detailed, with rounder faces and sketchy eyes. J.C. staff does a fine job at relating the art with the story, and the animation is quite reputable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Honey and Clover is a wonderful show. It will uplift the audience, makes them laugh or cry or feel the characters, which is done by an excellent show, one which the audience welcomes and enjoys. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some may say I like every anime that I watch but something about Honey and Clover really made me smile. Its about a group of students who attend an Art University, trying to become something related to art and creativity. Within this storyline you have love triangles, strange characters (Morita mostly *laughs*), and lots of character plots which allow you to become more enveloped with them on an almost personal level.\r\nYou could say the main character is Takemoto, a striving artist who is still struggling to find out what type of future he\\'ll have. He moves into a dorm-like apartment not far from the campusand meets several other students; Morita, who is a super-artist though when you see him, you wouldn\\'t know it due to how he reacts to things. He\\'s very motivitated by money and stardom. Mayama, an older student who has a love for a woman named Rika, who\\'s husband had passed away in a car accident, and she was badly hurt. Hagu who\\'s a tiny little woman, almost elf-like but full of amazing art skills and innocence, striving to just happily draw. Yamada, a pottery student, who volunteers at the university and in turn is allowed to use the kiln to create her works. The love triangles are between Hagu, Takemoto, and Morita, then Rika, Yamada, and Mayama. It seems that both Takemoto, and Morita fell in love with Hagu and the story goes from there, and Yamada despretely loves Mayama, but Mayama doesn\\'t want anything to do with it, and instead follows Rika, who fears hurting him (or claims she already has).\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the storyline you learn of their lives, meet other characters that help with the story and how everyone lives have become to what they have. For anyone looking to have a somewhat serious anime, but still with laughs and stories to make you cry, I really recommend this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first of two seasons (unless there\\'s 3 and I just haven\\'t found out about it yet).",

            "content": "It is not uncommon to worry about the future. What is my purpose in life? How will I change as a person and affect both my loved ones and those around me? Questions like these are thought about frequently and many begin to come to terms with the answers to these questions in their university years. Hachimitsu to Clover, or Honey and Clover, explores this idea, mixing in romance and relationships for a nice slow paced slice of life; it tells the tale of a group of college friends and colleagues as they spend their days growing close to each other, dealing with the outsideworld and work, and coming to terms with what they want out of life and their own desires. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Honey and Clover stand out from the typical high school rom-com slice of life is the fact that it takes on a much more serene and mature tone compared to the often crazy, silly, and awkwardness you might in other slice of life anime. Honey and Clover does an excellent job of drawing and evoking a variety of emotions out of the watcher. From laughing at Shinobu drive Takemoto and Mayama up a wall, to smiling at the genuine and caring Professor as he watches over Hagu, to frustration over Yamada and Mayama's relationship; there is never a dull moment. For anyone who's watched their fair share of slice of life, Honey and Clover pulls the genre off in a refreshing and unique matter and offers something new.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover does an excellent job of utilizing the characters' unique personalities and habits to create a realistic portrayal of everyday college life. From the crazy genius Shinobu who seems to be talented at many things but doesn't really care about utilizing it to the fullest to Takemoto, who on a whim chose to major in architecture because he liked making things with his hands, each character has their own set of problems that the series explores. The clash between desires and expectations is the overlying theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama and romance aspect of the show can be frustrating at times, but is a more accurate representation of relationships in real life. Often times in anime one can predict the flow of romance and relationships, such as who will end up with who, and the feelings and emotions come in a nice superficial box with a neat bow tie on top. However, relationships in real life are often different. Unlike in most romance and drama shows, love in real life does not always go the way you want it. It is more bitter, more mature. It can be extremely frustrating. It can be confusing and hectic. Honey and Clover does a very nice job of representing this through a solid cast of characters and exploring each individual's feelings for one another.\\n\\n\r\nOne last theme this show explores is natural talent and feelings of inferiority. In our world, there will always be an insurmountable gap between those of us who are truly talented and gifted, and those who are on the more ordinary side of things. Hard work and dedication can only close that gap so much. Honey and Clover shows how individuals both talented and ordinary think about this fact, and the problems that come with being on either side of the spectrum. Through the relationships of Takemoto, Hagu, Professor, and Shinobu, aspects such as expectations, guidance, free will, and desires are all laid out and explored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very simple and easygoing on the eyes. There is no flashy animation, just very basic yet powerful scenes and warm colors. The music complemented the mood being presented in each scene and was never out of place. There were lively pieces to accompany merry times and happy days, and somber tones to accentuate tension and dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover gives us a fresh perspective of the slice of life genre. Through mellow and slow-paced storytelling, the tale of this group of college students comes to life, and will make you feel as if you're living right alongside them. For those who tire of conventional slice of life romantic comedies with little to no substance, Honey and Clover might just be right for you.\\n",

I dont think this anime will ever pull me inif Hagu is the main love interest..Maybe it gets better if you are into children. lol i'm not. *shrug* Maybe if i'm that bored i'll decide if i want to watch a bit further since only two of the characters amused me at the beginning.",

            "content": "Wow. Honey and Clover is a somewhat long series (considering it has two series), and watching all of it is definitely time-consuming, but I guarantee that it will be worth it. \r\nStory: 9/10.  I can definitely say, without a doubt, that this is the most inspirational and moving anime I've ever seen. At times, there is that typical shoujo-romance thing going on, but other than that, everything else is just too amazing for words. Also, the story is a bit plain at times, but I loved it nonetheless. It's very unique in its own ways -- the way it creates dramas, the way therelationships work all fit perfectly well into the storyline.  It had a very calm atmosphere, yet there was enough drama to keep you watching. I love it. I couldn't ask for it any other way. :)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. I thought the OP and ED were done well, the characters were drawn cutely, and the animation was good. :) No complaints here. I love the very soft atmosphere the animation gave me. It was soft and warm feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. I listened to the soundtrack and I have to say I am IN LOVE with it! The music is probably one of the best features of this show. The calm relaxing acoustic music blended very well with the relaxing scenes. Suga Shikao's music felt right at home.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10.  I thought each character in the story was unique in their own way and were all well-developed. I loved Hagu's shyness, Shuuji's parent-like personality, Takumi's maturity and understanding, Morita's crazy self, etc. I thought every personality was great and fit the characters in the story amazingly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. The story was great, everything was beautifully done, and this anime was definitely awe-inspiring for me. There were a lot of scenes that, after watching it, made me think about life. Definitely recommended for everyone to watch. I gave it a 9/10 because at parts, it was a bit slow, and I thought there were some parts that could have been more fast-paced.",

            "content": "Spurred by good reviews to watch this anime, I picked it up and continued to watch hoping that the reviews would be justified. Towards the end, I toughed it out, but was ultimately greatly disappointed.\r\nIn a nutshell, this anime is a bore to watch. Unless you count graduating from college and getting a job as exciting and significant developments, every character is almost in the exact same spot they were in at the beginning of the series.\r\nWatch one episode and you basically get the gist: A bunch of friends in art school talk,  eat (a lot), get drunk (a lot), pine after this oneor that one, cry (one character seems to cry every episode, almost every 5 minutes), fervently work on art pieces, go to festivals, take field trips, have inner monologues, and don't address what is really on their minds to the ones who need to hear it. Their failures to communicate prevents them from making breakthroughs which serve to slow any development to a snail's pace artificially.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to watch adults fall in love with a character that looks and acts like a child, do not waste your time with this series. I expected the show to address why the character is this way and show every other character be conflicted about the attraction to her, but that didn't happen. Even if they did address the attraction, it is akin to mentally mature adults pursuing a mentally challenged adult. No bueno.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the show intended to continue after the 36th episode, but, as of now,  it didn't sufficiently tie up some of the threads that I was concerned about in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI liked how this anime looks, but the first 24 episodes seemed to have looked better than the last 12. The cartoonish expressions the characters often make gets to be too much for me though. The voice acting and sound design are the best things about this anime for me by far.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I didn't enjoy this series, I obviously won't re-watch it, and I strongly do not recommend it.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nFrom an early age, people often have their own dreams and aspirations. Kids may want to grow up to be astronauts or they may want to be super famous in the world of sports. But as they mature, reality sets in and they begin to worry less about their future and more about the present. With this shift in mentality comes an important question: what is truly, in my heart of hearts, important to me? Honey and Clover sets up as a nice slice-of-life show in order to answer this ever-lingering thought.\r\nSTORY\r\nHC stars a main cast of five:Takemoto, Morita, Hagu, Yamada, and Mayama. Starting off in Takemoto's early years of college, the show progresses over many months and years to show the characters dealing with everyday events.\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far one of the most slice-of-life shows I have ever witnessed. There is absolutely no overall arc to be had within the story. Even more so is the distinct lack of connection between the stories per episode. Things happen in a chronological order, but nothing in one episode truly affects what happens in the next. For this reason, much of the season is simply the characters hanging at festivals, drinking at parties, or conversing at work. Meaning, they literally showcase the characters doing their everyday activities. There's no intense action or heavy drama, it's just the whole gang getting by, day by day.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, the show is very character driven. It likes to explore the characters and how they are feeling with the consistent use of narration by a variety of the cast. In this way, we not only get to see how they are really feeling but also how they interact with one another while hiding their true selves. Speaking of selves, an important aspect of the show is this idea of \"self-realization.\" Each of the main cast struggle with their real identity. They have these ideas and emotions that they want to convey properly, but due to their lack of understanding or inability to succinctly express their feelings, they tend to wall themselves off more than they would like to. This is something that the show does very nicely and for each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the show is just how slow everything is. Despite jumping ahead in time on numerous occasions, you never really feel as if any progress is actually made. Besides the ending, once everything starts it stays almost exactly the same for the entirety of the season. And being such a character-driven show, this lack of realization on almost everyone's part feels quite tedious in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nHC is now roughly ten years old, but it still holds up quite well even when compared to today's standards.\\n\\n\r\nPart of HC's appeal is its art style. The best word to describe it is that everything looks \"soft.\" The colors that are there are not loud, the locations are standard, and the details are neither sharp nor dull. It gives off this mellow vibe that works pretty well with the actual tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual animation, I found this one to be a bit harder to describe. For the most part, the animation is average. With lots of dialogue and characters sitting around, there isn't much of a chance for the show to showcase anything spectacular. However, it can do reasonably well when it is showing character movements or when it is going through one of its comedy bits.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character designs, I found them to be quite likable. They all look \"appropriate\" for not only their age but for who they are as people. Mayama is mature and kind, Yamada is beautiful and emotional, Morita is handsome and outgoing, etc. The show does a nice job of making these characters feel \"real\" enough so that we as an audience could potentially believe that such characters could exist somewhere out there in the world.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSticking to just the big five, I enjoyed all of the characters minus one.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the least of the best, Takemoto is somewhat the MC for the show; he's often the one who narrates what is going on. He's determined, selfless, and generally unsure of himself. For almost the entire season, he acts as an almost \"fifth-wheel.\" Rather than acting he merely observes everyone else. So for the majority of the show, I honestly did not care for him. However, by the show's end, he managed to make a lasting impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nMayama represents the leader of the group. More mature in both personality and age when compared to the rest, he generally avoids trouble by hiding his emotions. This creates a lot of the issues he has with the characters around him, but what's unique is that he knows (from himself and from those that tell him) that he is like this.\\n\\n\r\nMorita is undoubtedly the most interesting character in the group. Unintentionally direct and completely carefree, he is more often than not the one who reveals the gang's true feelings, all the while suppressing his own. He easily makes you laugh throughout the show due to his crazy antics, and provided much needed breaks in the overall slowness.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character from season one was Yamada. Smart, beautiful, and caring, she is the epitome of the perfect woman. And yet, her feelings of love have a difficult time reaching who they are meant for. Her struggle is hard to watch at times, simply because its a battle that she is constantly losing but always getting back into. When she isn't feeling down, she too provides a great amount of comedy and variety to the show that I greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe character I found to be the worst was actually Hagu. Besides just not really liking her personality and character interactions, she doesn't really do anything of importance. While she may be the focus of some of the characters at certain points in the season, her actions never have any meaning or consequence. To put it simply, she's rather boring and uninteresting when competing with the other four characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nHC is strange in that it has one OP but two EDs. The OP has a great amount of singing in its range, but I never found the OP to be to my liking. Furthermore, it doesn't even really fit with the show, its just too \"grandiose\" in its vocal ability. As in, it's not mellow enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe first and second ED are somewhat similar. I found them to be okay, but they were more aligned with how the show felt. The singing and beats themselves are rather plain but in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was quite nice, especially the piano piece that the show liked to use a lot. I actually found the soundtrack to be of better quality than what the OP and EDs had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, there was no stand-out performances. Instead, I actually did not enjoy Haruka Kudou's voice for Hagu. Something about it just didn't really seem to fit with her character.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest and say that this one was somewhat hard to get through. I enjoy a good slice-of-life, but HC can be really hard to like since there is almost nothing going on at any given time. And even when something happens, neither the story nor the characters progress in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy at times was hit or miss. One of my favorite scenes was the Twister game simply due to how over-the-top Morita made it. I also enjoyed seeing Yamada beat up Mayama every single time for just being him.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is one of the show's selling points, and here as well it was hit or miss. The Yamada, Mayama, and Rika love triangle was executed nicely while the Hagu, Morita, and Takemoto love triangle was not. The former was interesting in its direction but the latter lacked anything tangible to even consider. In other words, the first triangle was fleshed out while the second triangle felt tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Honey and Clover focuses on two things: oneself and nothing at all. As a slice-of-life it does its job, but the lack of anything significant occurring, besides the ending, makes the whole experience a tough one to get all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, super slice-of-life at a snail's pace\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, soft art style with decent animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, all but Hagu are nice characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OP and ED are okay, soundtrack is good, VAs are average\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, romance and comedy are hit or miss making it tough to get through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Minor spoilers for honey and clover, so be warned.\r\nAfter the personal turmoil of an experience that was watching 3-gatsu no lion, I found myself needing more. As I have stated on another review, that you can look for, if you are interest for more in-depth thoughts, 3-gatsu has managed to become one of my favorite pieces of fictions. So it is only natural, that after that I would be looking for the authors other works, at worst to see how she has evolved as writer, at best to get a close experience. On that note, there was another highly regarded work from author umino chika,and the purpose of this review is to discuss it, honey and clover, and to make some assessments on her general writing style, by comparing it with her later work. Does it hold up to the lofty expectations I created for her, is it able to fulfill my dose of her endless sentimental style of storytelling, at least until her other work, becomes my favorite anime from 2018?\\n\\n\r\nYouth, the age of the rose colored spring of life. That magic time where everything seemed possible and achievable. I am sure you have heard all this idealistic bullshit about the period, but maybe it sounds like that, when you are way older. This is show is basically a very earnest and heartfelt representation of this age. In here we see the coming of age of our 5 main characters, all offering their own unique spin and personal perspective on the topic. One aspect that helps to sell this portrayal is the setting where this takes in, not some high school but a freaking college. Yes, you heard it right, this does not take place in a generic high school as every school comedy ever, but instead in an art college to be more specific. This is important not only because this is the time period I am current living in, so the image of a bunch of broken young adults living together, and doing their best with limited money is immensely relatable to me, believe me it is. But it also adds so much to the story. There is the sense of urgency and importance to the characters conflicts you can only find it in this setting, acts like choosing a career and joining the workforce are right around the corner for this characters, which are life changing moments and decisions. It is a time of change, you can have to go to another town to get the college, find yourself living with completely new people, maybe even sustaining yourself, having lots of different and more serious concerns. It is no wonder that change is such a big issue for the characters themselves. And the show really commits to this representation of the period, there is such an immense degree of situations and emotions being presented, the search for meaning and direction in life, the friendships, the romance, the rejections, the insecurity, the separations, reencounters. And guess what they sell it hard on every emotion, the character\u2019s interactions are so honest and endearing that the viewer itself starts seeing them as their friends and loves just to see them hang out together, it evokes the same feeling of having this unique and special group of friends. It may be melodramatic and annoying but those sure are valid and important feeling, we all felt at the time, we all though what we were going through, was the most important and serious thing ever. The variety in situations is also important, there is something for everyone to relate here, be it Takemoto aimlessness and search for a path in life, morita inability to let go of his past and connect with others, yamada failings in here romantic connections, Hagu trauma for her abuse as a child and how that affects her. There is something for everyone to grab that can relate and resonates deeply with their own experiences (which is kind of one of my main negative points). Not only our main characters add a lot to this, seeing the secondary character\u2019s perspective can also be very enlightening. There is a duo of old teachers that observe Takemoto, to him the work he was making was a pointless and worthless representation of his lack of purpose in life. They themselves recognize it as such, and they love it for that, it leads them to the memories of their own younger selves, as they were dealing with the time, it might seem like though worthless period at the time but it is very precious to them as they grow older, they feel very nostalgic about it. Another aspect is how most older characters\u2019 act, like nomiya and hanamoto, it is their older age and experience that leads them to be better at dealing with their issues and emotions that weight our mains, to the point they usually act for emotional support to them.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, many would think I am being facetious when saying that clover takes place at a time of grandiose changes in our characters\u2019 lives, because pretty much nothing really changes that much since the start of this anime. The passage of time is acknowledging sure, days, months seasons and even years pass by, this story takes places during several years of our character\u2019s lives. But the main core and dynamic of our main characters, their struggles and most of the background characters, still remains relatively unchanged by this story course. I have two ideas of why that is the case, one is that this is just laziness of the author, trying to keep the status quo, just to keep the story going as much as possible. But I still believe those are methodically planned and used to portray what I really believe is the main idea brought forward in this story. The main motifs this show used are the Ferris wheel, the main oppressive imaginery that seems to inhabit a lot of our characters imagenery, and the bicycle, (also that spinning cuck marker that I have no idea what it is) that is not only Takemoto means of escape, it is also an object that dominates his thoughts. Both of those show circular imagenery that points out to the cyclic nature of life, this show is portraying. No matter how much our characters struggle they also end up at approximately the same place, all in a never ending cycle, with only the feeling of regret for not accomplishing what they desire, at the end of the line. Takemoto is probably the biggest case for this, his literal journey is not only of searching for his true self as the characters in the show point out, by seeing how far he can go he wants to break this cycle, what path and decision in life he can do to actually make the change he want to make in the world, (his confession, finding a job) actually happen and getting rid of the uncertainty, his future has. Changing yourself in clover is not impossible though, both Takemoto and mayama have remarkable aspects of that, and this ties back to the topic of growing up. Mayama\u2019s case is also really interesting, the guy at the start of the series is obsessed with the appearance of maturity, smoking, drinking being kind of reliable to his friends, just looking cool. He believes this is a sign of growing up, he will impress rika, the more mature woman he is in love with that, his insecurity holding him back to actually get closer to her. When he acknowledges the flaws in himself, and starts doing the best he can for her, regardless of any appearances, regardless of how pathetic he may end up looking in her eyes, Mayama finally gets it, he matures a little and finally starts breaking the cycle he is in. Takemoto also grows as a person, he finally stops worrying about grandiose questions like the meaning of life, no one is able to give him answers, he found the value of those around him, and can support the uncertainty of his future by sharing it with others. Not really related, but I wanted to say I love the idea of how hollow he feels being represented by this monotone noise he hears at his home, I swear I have felt the exact same thing, in regards to the noise my refrigerator makes. Facing change is frightening, you never know where it can lead, or how you will end in the process, it is something difficult to put forward, maybe as much as growing up, but finally acknowledging and making those things you so dearly desired happen is definitely worth it. Takemoto still got a sense of satisfaction out of his acts, despite the fact he really got rejected in the end, he made something great, and was proud of it regardless. This a stance and idea, I would love to be able to do myself, in my own life.\\n\\n\r\nI do intend to use umino Chika (thanks for being alive and working btw) newer product, 3-gatsu, to shed some light into my bigger issues with this anime. While both were very similar in tone, the signatures of heavy handed sentimentality, the abrupt tone shifts, she is probably the only author, that blends so perfectly moments where I am close to tears, and moments where I am laughing my ass of, in a single episode. Like really both in 3-gatsu and in clover, chika is great at writing comedy. Never the comedy feels out of place, intrusive to the drama, or even downright insulting, like in shows like shitgatsu. And I just love how not mean spirited it is always, this sensation of this loveable characters teasing each other is just so heartwarming and perfect, I was sad to see this aspect take a back seat latter in the show. The variety in tones, and how perfectly she captures each one them is one of her greatest strengths as a writer, she is just so great at creating pathos and making it feel earned out of the most mundane situations. This is also complemented in clover by the usage of music, which was crucial for this anime. Half of what made most of the better moments in the anime work so well, was the complement of an atmospheric, and compelling soundtrack, some of the tracks in this conveyed the feeling of scenes, with the music alone. The decision of having dialogue and plot take a backset, for more atmospheric scenes, where the tracks would be the focus really paid off, making for some of the memorable and intense moments in this anime. Clover has one of my favorite soundtracks in anime, heck I could keep listening to it all day. But 3-gatsu no lion has a way narrower focus, it is first and foremost rei\u2019s story, while clover shifts perspective between our 5 different main characters. And really the scope of themes clover has going for it is also way larger, there is an infinitude of themes with lots of characters adding their own little perspective to the mix, excluding sexuality, that is taboo in this show. But you know what, that variety usually does not work to the shows advantage, most of the themes and ideas being thrown around are not being explored in meaningful ways. Like for example, there is a segment when they go about, the feelings of loneness Takemoto is having, what comes out of it? A poetic monologue about how this is something everyone feels at certain moments in their lives, always coming and going, that is it. No insight or exploration of such a serious and important aspect of life. Ideas like these are being thrown around constantly, and not much of them gets the attention they deserve. This theme exploration is not entirely bad on itself, if anyone that is passing through those periods of life, can get one or two little insights about a personally important topic, but it still pales in comparison to 3-gatsu, which has a way more focused storyline and fully develops most themes it brings forward. Compared to 3-gatsu shows rei loneness, and how much it adds to the story and is explored, it also helps that 3-gatsu is way subtler about its set of themes, clover sometimes has those mentor older characters, explain the whole point the author is trying to make in length, which makes me think I am watching oregairu again. And that is never a good thing. Also this taking place in an art project, but rarely ever focusing on the creative process, value of art, or the mindset of artists is really a missed opportunity. Yes, I in general prefer 3-gatsu to clover, and maybe it all comes to me being kind of similar to rei as a person, only once before have I seen such a relatable character, that was a haunting and beautiful representation of what I was feeling at the moment, but I do find it have greater value and storytelling overall.\\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this show? Absolutely yes. If you are looking for a more mundane and heartwarming take on teenage life, especially if you are going through this period yourself, this is the anime for you. I am surprised this is in fact not loved for more people, it manages to portray so beautifully this turmoil of emotions, that make up a big part of our lives, with good character writing, and lots of important and resonating life lessons. I would really expect this to be even life changing for some. It may not be the perfect masterpiece, I found Umino Chika younger work to be, and this season may only conclude one-character arc, so not sure if the next season finishes the story, but I hardly found it to be unsatisfying as an ending. Clover is a wonderful journey; I will remember fondly for a long time. Also God bless Umino Chika now officially my new favorite mangaka. May she keep blessing us, with those amazing manga (which I have not seen any, just watched anime adaptations), that make me feel so happy, fulfilled and motivated, which will always be a safe heaven, and stop point, when I feel reality becomes a little too hard to handle. Thank you so much.\\n",

            "content": "In life, there\u2019s always moments of happiness. Happiness, in general, can be achieved quite easily; receiving an unexpected gift, having great success in your career, and most especially, falling in love. But have we once thought that every time happiness comes our way, there will always be someone around us that will be on the opposite side of the coin? Failure comes with success, bitterness come with love. These are bundled facts in life that no human being is immune to. In my first review, I\u2019ll be talking about Hachimitsu to Clover or Honey and Clover. A series that tells the story about a groupof people that tasted both success and failure in life. Honey and Clover. What an ironic title for a show that gives off both happiness and bitterness.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTalking about the \u201cmain\u201d story is hard because every main character have different goals and aspirations. Takemoto and his continuous journey to find himself, Morita and his path to revenge, Hagu and her desire in becoming a great artist, & Mayama and Yamada in their pursuit for the love of the ones they love *smirk*. These stories are all really interesting because they are so realistic. It tells the viewers throughout the series that not all things in life go how they want it to be. The sad reality that there will always be someone better than you, and that love can sometimes be one-sided. However, in spite of the \u201cnegative\u201d side of the show, there\u2019s this mysterious magic that appears almost after each depressing scenes. It feels like a figurative pinch in the heart. As I\u2019ve said, a beautiful tale of happiness and sadness. You will feel happy and sad at the same time while holding back tears of... I don\u2019t even know. There\u2019s one time I felt sad and happy at the same time so it\u2019s really difficult to describe the right feeling. A really good show if you want to feed birds at a park while feeling empty inside. Not a bad price to pay for an amazingly good show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n\tBecause there are many main characters in the series, I will avoid talking about a specific character in general. So, yeah, I\u2019ll start. \\n\r\nIn spite of my continuous bitching about the show\u2019s sometimes depressing atmosphere, it might be hard to believe that every character in this series also have a fun and fluffy side to them as well.  Every character might (and WILL) send tears running down your cheeks, but always remember that these tears are not limited to only the emotional moments, they can also make you cry out tears of joy (A little bit of an overstatement, but you know what I mean) with all the really funny comedy. Some might love them, some may not, but you will surely get attached to them in just a couple of episodes throughout their long journey.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\n\tThe animation for both series of Honey and Clover was done by J.C. Staff, famous for works such as Ano Natsu de Matteru, Golden Time, Nodame Cantabile, and my all time favorite anime: Eiken. The animation for this show is pretty standard compared to most of their show but that\u2019s understandable because not much special effect is used. It\u2019s a simple slife (slice of life) romance show. It doesn\u2019t have bombastic scenes like Shana\u2019s flames (Random tangent. J.C. Staff\u2019s fire is probably the sexiest fire in current time. If KyoAni made water look sexy, J.C.\u2019s selling point is fire. *points to Shana, Index, and Witch Craft Works*) or Nodame\u2019s 3D orchestration so it\u2019s pretty simple, though, not bad. I kinda hated the character designs but that\u2019s a personal thing. It feels a little too shoujo/jousei-ish for my taste but its fine. As my policy goes, Even if the animation/character designs are bad, if the story is good, I\u2019ll watch it. So, yeah, cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t think I should be reviewing this section because personally, I don\u2019t have confidence in my taste in music. I like music, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good judge in this field. So, don\u2019t hold it against me if my opinion in music is that bad. Now that\u2019s out of the way, maestro, music! \\n\r\nSince I rarely listen to whole anime soundtrack, I\u2019ll bring this down on the actual music that was used in the show. I\u2019ll start with the OPs. OP 1 was really amazing. Nakushita yakusoku wa hoshi\u2026. Enough on my weeabo karaoke. lol. Anyway, that OP was really good not only because of the music but also because of the visuals. What a really fun foodporn. I never once skipped that OP which made me sad once it got replaced. I wish the OP stayed the same throughout the whole series. You know, like what they did with Log Horizon 2\u2019s OP; new foodporn but same music. In regards to the music used on the show, I can\u2019t quite remember it except the mellow piano version of the OP during emotional moments, then that wacky party like tune used during funny moments. Those ones were really well used. Though repetitive, it fits the moment perfectly and adds to the overall feel of the show. And allow me to make a confession, I rarely watch EDs (I watch a show\u2019s ED once then that\u2019s it). With that said, I don\u2019t really have anything to say with the ED since I don\u2019t remember it, I just remember a Ferris wheel and that\u2019s it. lol. In regards to the dub in both sides, I haven\u2019t seen the English dub yet so I\u2019ll limit this in the japo dub side. Since I can\u2019t understand much Japanese, I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s a good dub. Hiroshi Kamiya, one of my favorite seiyuu played as Takemoto. Kamiya always has this weird accent but in Honey and Clover he used the dialect from Osaka and it was just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\n\tNow, after pulling random numbers out of my ass (8.6 for story, 8.4 for characters, 7.3 for animation, 8.2 for music, and 9 for overall enjoyment), I\u2019ll gladly give Honey and Clover with an overall score of [b]8.3[/b]. Honey and Clover is a show that really excels in making you feel like crap in the rain, but tells you that once the rain stopped, you\u2019ll be mixed in the water, evaporate, become rain, fall in a river, then be made as a drinkable water (What the fuck did I just made up?). Uhhhh, If I somewhat gave you a trauma because of that scenario, feel free to kill me in my sleep. Anyway, back on topic. Yeah, Honey and Clover is an amazing show, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, you have my full-blown recommendation. Go on, watch it, but just be warned of the void in your heart that will come once you finish it.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation, why don\u2019t you try Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo? Both shows are pretty similar in the \u201cYou\u2019re shit. You have no talent. Go die in a fire.\u201d section. Though, slight spoiler, Sakurasou has too many depressing moment. If Honey and Clover pinches your heart, Sakurasou will stab your heart. Both have pretty decent comedy too. The romance in both series is really unsatisfying but cute. And they\u2019re both made by J.C. Staff too.\\n\\n\r\nYou can also try Nagi no Asukara if you want too. Though not as depressing as Honey and Clover, Nagi no Asukara have some rather sad moments as well that might make you shed a tear. Another important thing to point out is that both series have love n-gons (not just triangles. Not just squares. They have too many to even count) that went completely nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n\tWell, that\u2019s it for me, thanks if you read all of that. I might do this again if I have the chance to. If you like it, feel free to send me a PM if you want me to review other shows. I\u2019ll see you (whoever\u2019s reading this) around. Bye-nara!",

            "content": "I first picked up Honey and Clover one school break during my college days, during the days when all I can think about is friendship/love/pressure to succeed/family woes, and then I found an image of myself in the story. This is how Honey and Clover succeeds to become a heart-warming slice of life series, I think it gave me a glimmer of hope despite the fleeting nature of youth, HnC assures me that you can make wonderful memories even when youth is long gone.\r\nThe pace of HnC is slow, but relaxing. It is animation in poetry form, the details and soft colours paint a character'smood or scenario and the feelings slowly flood your senses. Then there is the calming voice of Takemoto speaking in the background and his narration becomes the frame of the painting, piecing everything together. Beautiful and carefully hand-picked soundtracks by the mangaka herself are laced into the anime and I believe the songs were chosen for their lyrics which never fail to reflect the innermost emotions the featured characters are going through that moment in time. Just with these few elements, I'm constantly amazed and blown away by the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut the story is what keeps you on your toes, despite the slower pacing, the twists and circumstances of every character captures you and sometimes what they experience is an incident I can relate to and I find myself cheering/crying for the character. Humour is often used to balance the mood, just the way we would in real life, and some the characters will send you in tears, while laughing. Because...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are so diverse and well-developed you will love them all, if not you'd love at least a few of them. There is the timid but talented Hagu-chan who conquers her lack of courage through her emotive paintings, nice guy Takemoto is a good friend to all but lonely at times when his willpower is shaken, Morita is a crazy blitz you can't help laughing at but his mysterious nature also pulls you in, Mayama the big brother torn between woes of loving and being loved, Yamada the naive girl who is crazy for Mayama and constantly has her heart broken, and of course Shu-chan the caretaker who watches over the group and sometimes nostalgia creeps up to him and he find himself missing his good friends from college. These are the primary characters, but revolving each of them are many more characters so different and colourful, you may just feel something familiar with any one of them too.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie, Honey and Clover remains one of my favourite series in print and motion form, and I've lost count of the number of times I re-watched the series so I may sound like one of those fans who will protect the series at all cost. However, while some may love the action-packed theme anime series out there, I believe some of us are also searching for that one anime that speaks to our inner emotions. When I re-watch HnC now, long past those youthful college days, whatever I have felt years ago while watching the series I can still feel them strongly if not even more strongly than before. It is a timeless art piece in the anime genre and as it sums up in one of my favourite quote from the series - \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAs time passes, the day will come when everything will fade to memories. But those miraculous days, when you and I, along with everyone else, searched together for just that one thing, will continue revolving forever somewhere deep in my heart, as my bittersweet memory.\u201d",

            "content": "The key to happiness is something we humans long to find in our short time in this earth. It's something that can't be seen nor touched, but we want to find it. A way we find this key is to go through our lives searching it, but like a four-leaved clover, it takes some fumbling around the grass to find it. In Honey and Clover, our main characters do just that, fumbling around life to find that key to happiness while life keeps going forward, no matter if they find it or not. \r\nWhile this is a story of not battles to save the world,nor about a meaningless crush on the transfer student, but a story about a battle, the battle we all have inside of us to find our what is truly our own unique meaning here in life and the love that while bittersweet, it taught us about love.  This story is relateble to all of us as we follow a group of art college students going to life looking for their key to happiness and the battle that ranges inside us as we go through our lives looking for that key.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is very compatible to the story in more ways than your usual anime. While most anime has the normal bold look, this anime uses a watercolor look to it that makes it soft looking, which really goes with the flow of the anime, which is slow paced.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music, it uses mostly slow rock or some pop that really fits with the theme and flow of the story. It uses a lot of music, that ranges in types, from rock to jazz, but while it seems to be a lot, they all go with the story's flow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a really important thing for any story, anime or manga. They are what projects the story's feeling and flow. If the characters don't show anything, it's just a boring book that doesn't capture our attention.Our main characters show a lot of significance to the story, because without them, Honey and Clover would not made any sense without their feelings to the story.\\n\r\nMayama; playing the role of the cool, intelligent type. He\u2019s always shown smoking and looking off into the distance, giving advice to the other characters,taking care of himself finacially. Of course he's not perfect, jokes are made throughout the anime about his stalker-like admiration for Rika. He\u2019s a bit of both: on one hand, a calm and collected upperclassman, but on the other hand, obsessive and overprotective. \\n\r\nAyumi; In the group, she's the motherly character, helping and caring for her friends. While she may look like a beautiful young woman, on the inside she's like a baby. Completely innocent, she continues to strive for a love that would never work out, but because she's hesitant to cut off that stem, she continues to hurt and not move on. \\n\r\nHagu; while her character's look and act is interesting, her character begins to make a bit more sense when you think how she was brought up, and, more importantly, her love for art. Raised in a enclosed environment,  she was always a distant child, it\u2019s as if she lived in a completely different world, and didn't bother learning the basics of socializing. As a result of that, she looks like a child when compared to her classmates, and she needs someone like Shuu to take care of her like a father. \\n\r\nMorita; My god... this guy can bring comic relief in any situation. However, he also serves as an important part of the group, he's the glue to hold them all together. While he's the \"idiot\u201d type, he's surprisingly very mature and perspective. He\u2019s a bit like Mayama, he helps the other characters out by giving advice and giving them the harsh reality at times. \\n\r\nTakemoto; the everyman character. An interesting guy because he was normal, but it was his ordinary, relatable personality that let his story made what Honey and Clover is. Even though he has no unique traits or abilities to drive him forward, he entered art school, but has no clue as to what he wants to do after he graduates. Because of this and other stress in his life, he built a massive tower, broke it down, and then ride half way across Japan and back.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of \u201cmoving forward\u201d;the flow of time, moving forward always. And the four leafed clover, representing the one \u201cthing\u201d that they were all searching for. In this case, that thing was something more important than a clover, like love, or happiness, but hard to find. Because we are all battling that battle and finding our clovers, it just a matter of falling on the grass and looking for our happiness.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, it made me think about myself but also made me smile as I watched. I suggest this for all who want to enjoy themselves but also reflect on their lives. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n",

            "content": "For many of us who watch anime, the medium can become something more than simply animated entertainment. Sometimes, we will find ourselves connecting on a deep emotional level with a character or characters in a show. Sometimes, the story will seem less like a fanciful escape and more like a reflection upon society or our individual lives. These are the kind of shows stick with us. They'll make us laugh, they'll make us cry, and sometimes they'll make us realize something new about ourselves. Honey and Clover is one of those kind of anime.\r\nBased on the manga by Chika Umino, Honey and Clover follows thelives of five fledgling artists and their journey through the exciting and simultaneously terrifying world that we know as college. Through the eyes of these five students and observe them them growing, affected by the years of challenging experiences through which they have gained many cherished friendships and also come to know the agonies of unrequited love.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of the series is the animation. The bold, hard lined style you see in most anime will not be found here. Instead, animation studio J.C. Staff takes a wholly different approach by using a faded watercolor palette and soft sketched character designs. The style may not appeal to everyone, but it best reflects the true nature of the characters and their setting. Aside from the color palette, the animation goes through various perspective changes so subtly that it can even make the simple shot of a single character interesting. In essence, it is like art in motion.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the audio needs to work hand in hand with the visuals and Honey and Clover has quite a robust soundtrack. Many of the insert selections worked well to heighten and sharpen the on-screen emotions. However, not all of the songs fit each scene like a glove and at times it felt like maybe there might even be too many songs they had tried to fit in. Despite that complaint, the songs themselves were all very good, even the instrumental tracks, and &ldquo;Waltz&rdquo; may hands-down be one of the best ending themes of any anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect that may be universally agreed upon about this series is that the characters definitely make the show. Honey and Clover, like many other slice-of-life series, falls back on the characters to help carry the series and all five of the main characters do so phenomenally. Throughout the series, the perspective changes so that we see, hear, think, and occasionally feel what any given character is going through at that time. Depending on a viewer&rsquo;s past experiences in college or even just life in general, certain characters will become more appealing and easier to relate to than others. Someone who has never been torn between someone they love and a close friend who loves them will have a hard time relating to a character like Mayama. Also, while a character like Takemoto may be more accessible to the male audience, Ayumi may be a better focal point for women.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important thing to realize is that just about anyone who watches this show will find a character who they can directly relate to in some way or another. From Takemoto&rsquo;s indecisiveness about his own life, Morita&rsquo;s slacker appeal and almost unfair success, Hagumi&rsquo;s torn desire between being a success she&rsquo;s not proud of or a failure she can live with. These are not just character struggles, these are struggles we all go through and we begin to see these characters as our friends and companions as we make our way through our own ordeals.\\n\\n\r\nAs said already, Honey and Clover is a slice-of-life series, which means it could take place anywhere at anytime with anyone inside the world as already is. It is a balanced and yet lively blend of romance, drama, and comedy without going too overboard on any single element, much like life itself. The story moves forward very quickly, skipping weeks, even months at a time between episodes. This could be viewed as slightly unrealistic as viewers may believe the characters should change faster than they do. Regardless, the character development is there, and does proceed at a realistic pace relative to the length of the series. Though the ending is inconclusive, those who enjoyed it to the end can take solace in knowing a conclusive second season awaits them to tie up all the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like how Azumanga Daioh is called &ldquo;the anime you should watch if you&rsquo;ve been through high school&rdquo;, Honey and Clover is the anime to watch if you&rsquo;ve been through college. Graduates who watch this will probably feel a good amount of nostalgia. At the same time, those of us who haven&rsquo;t been through college or are still going through it will enjoy a realistic simulation of where we might be going and how we might deal with it. By empathizing with the characters and relating to them, you&rsquo;ll come to see Honey and Clover as more than an anime; It's a life experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis review is the final result of a review team composed of members from the &quot;Critics and Connoisseurs&quot; club.

            "content": "Ever get that nice feeling after you finished watching a really good series? That&rsquo;s how I felt when I finished watching Honey and Clover.\r\nWhat a wonderful story. It&rsquo;s a good mix of bittersweet growing pains, salty teardrops, and huge doses of soul searching, all brought about by Love. Ah yes, Love. That is what defines the plot of Honey and Clover. Through this anime, we see how love can go both ways &ndash; it can send you flying in the sky, or it can leave you with a knife in the back.\r\nI can relate to mostly everyone in the story, and this is also whyit was so easy to understand for me. Yamada&rsquo;s frustration over unrequited love, Takemoto&rsquo;s fear of the future and time quickly passing by (believe me, time in this anime is fast-paced), Hagu&rsquo;s feelings of pressure from everyone around her, and of course, the loneliness that everyone felt from time to time. The ability to relate to each and every one of the characters made Honey and Clover such a good watch for me, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be the same for everyone who will watch this series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite the serious tones, there are still moments that are quite funny. Most of the comedic relief comes from Morita, who is actually one of my favorite characters. His idiosyncrasies are what made him great to watch. I love that scene where he accepted the Mochademy Award (A nod to the Academy awards) for best CG. There was also this great episode where Morita and Takemoto played some sort of twister game until their limbs were intertwined. Of course, you can&rsquo;t forget chapters L and F which were both funny as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters because they were all so relatable and they were all managed effectively. At the end of the series, you know everything that goes/went on behind their facades. They all had well thought of histories and wonderful unique personalities that go so well together. It&rsquo;s almost like an anime version of FRIENDS. I already mentioned that I like Morita, but my other favorite is Mayama. I kinda developed a crush on him too; I actually see what Yamada sees in him. I was kind of annoyed that he picked that old hag Rika over Yamada. I really hate that woman; she&rsquo;s only out to hurt Mayama. I&rsquo;m definitely on team Ayumi &ldquo;Tetsujin&rdquo; Yamada (Even though she tends to ramble on a lot)!\\n\\n\\n\r\nDrawing style was something new. It reminded me of old school anime with a new twist. It had the same look and feel of 80s anime with except it was updated and fresh. It was probably because of the coloring technique - the colors were just lovely, they weren&rsquo;t vibrant, like how I usually would like colors to be, but they were done well and the colors didn&rsquo;t clash, so I actually liked it. It reminded me of water color paintings, a trend I noticed from watching JC Staff series. Usually the illustrations are done well, they barely change or if there are any changes it goes unnoticed. Although I did notice a huge shift in Hagu&rsquo;s appearance &ndash; She was a lot prettier in the first episode compared to the rest of the series. Her look was done well though &ndash; she had beautiful eyes and hair (same thing with Yamada).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were different animation techniques that were used. I like the use of stop motion, I&rsquo;m guessing the first opening theme sequence was made using stop motion and clay figures. There was also the use of live action, which was for the second opening theme sequence (The poodle was just adorable). Some scenes had a more weathered look, and there was even an instance were vector art was used. Of course, there was the use of CG. CG is always good if it&rsquo;s used to give depth to animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was actually pretty good. My favorite seiyu for this series is Tomokazu Sugita, Mayama&rsquo;s seiyu, who was also the seiyu for Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, another favorite of mine. I also like Morita&rsquo;s seiyu, Yuji Ueda. I think it&rsquo;s funny when his voice turns soft. The other seiyus, such as Keiji Fujiwara and Mikako Takahashi were already familiar to me, since I&rsquo;ve watched/currently series they worked for before, and what they did for Honey and Clover were splendid as well, but as for Hagu&rsquo;s seiyu, I&rsquo;m a bit indifferent. Based on the information I saw about her, she seems to be a newbie (I think she&rsquo;s only 18) and Hagu Hanamoto is probably her most notable role. Anyway, everyone did a good job because they brought out their character&rsquo;s personalities really well, and the dialogues were easy to follow.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m surprised that most of Yuzo Hayashi&rsquo;s work was for Sailormoon. I actually thought the music for this anime was done well &ndash; everything was modern and contemporary. I like the wide variety of insert songs that were used as BGM, and of course, the opening and ending themes weren&rsquo;t bad either. At the end of the series I found myself humming and bopping my head to the catchy music of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank goodness for the second season, plus the extra two episodes. If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I Probably would be close to tears by now. This is undeniably one of the best series (Thank God to no fan service!) I&rsquo;ve ever watched, and will watch again.",

            "content": "Almost everything about Honey and Clover is unprecedented and perfected. From the unnerving OP to the moving ending narration, each episode is a dramatic and romantic take on the special lives of the six main characters. There is no action and there is no fanservice so the stereotyped teenage male audiences will avoid this series, however, the intelligent humor and very intricate intricate character development which dominates the show is sure to satisfy most mature fans who are sick of slapstick, perverted anime. At times it does get very similar to American soapies but I believe that Honey and Clover outdoes any love triangle stories.Each character goes through their frustrating situations, which don't seem to conclude detailed enough. The angelic Hagumi tackles her self-esteem issues, Mayama chases after Rika who is still mourning over her late boyfriend, Ayumi fights her depression after being repetitively rejected by Mayama, Morita (who provides for some of the best comedy I've seen in anime) tries to deal with his own expectations of life, Shuuji devotes himself religiously to the welfare of Hagu, and Takemoto attempts to escape out of the banal life ahead of him. These complex characters see the most impressive explorations of life, romance and personal fears. At times there is some repetition in the plot and it may seem a bit predictable, but there really is no competition for the best josei anime around. Recommended to anyone who wants to experience the reality of love or to be inspired and have a little cry at the end. Top notch anime 5 stars.",

            "content": "Title: Honey and Clover\r\nManga, Live-Action Adaptations, Anime: Honey and Clover was originally a manga created by Chika Umino.  It began its run in Sueisha's CUTiEcomic maganize in June of 2000, and swithced over to Young YOU in July of 2001, and ran there until the magazine's demise in 2005, and finished up its run in Chorus in July 2006.  The manga stands at ten collected volumes, and has been licensed Stateside by Viz's Shoujo Beat label; the first volume will be released on March 8th of this year.  Honey and Clover also won the Kodansha Manga Award for best shoujo manga in2003.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover also has two live-action adaptations to its name.  The first is a live-action movie adaptation that was released on July 22nd, 2006 in Japanese theatres.  The second is a live-action TV drama that started airing on January 8th of this year.  Neither has been licensed Stateside, and neither will be covered in this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adaptation was 24 episodes long, and was produced by JC Staff (famous for their work on Revolutionary Girl Utena and Excel Saga) and directed by Kenichi Kasai (famous for his work on Nodame Canabile).  It ran on Japanese TV from April 14th to September 25th, 2005.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Honey and Clover follows the lives and relationships of five college students -- Mayama, Takemoto, Morita, Hagu, and Ayu over a period of about five years.\\n\\n\r\nIt was really hard for me to get into this at first.  For the first four episodes, I liked what I was watching, but I didn't really feel the pressing need to see what happened next.  However, this changed in the next few episodes, mainly because everything had been more or less established, and they started developing things.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who are in college and watching this are going to be stunned at the realism of this.  It feels like these characters could very well be people around you, and the situations they're in could be things you or your friends are going through at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, there's no overlying plot.  However, unlike KamiChu, this isn't a problem, mainly because the characters and their relationships are developed well and are the actual center of the story, not driven by some cardboard cutouts and a crappy problem-of-the-week plot.  Also, there's a lot of fairly obvious metaphors and some crazy-ass humor that make the show even better.  ^^\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are going to be some who are depressed at the rather open ending.  However, there is the second season (Honey and Clover II), which I'm going to be starting shortly and will eventually review.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Absofuckinglutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe background is done in what looks like watercolors, so it's kind of hazy and washed-out, similar to what you see in Potemayo's backgrounds.  The character designs are a blend between the typical anime design and a more manga-esque look.  They also have the budget to change clothes at least once every episode.  SD is very common when tied in with the crazy-ass humor, which is just made of WIN.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this combined serves to make an absolutely beautiful series.  It's up there with Gankutsuou's visuals, but not quite that extreme.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is w/r/t Hagu's character design.  Yes, I know that you want to emphasize that she's a bit sheltered and innocent, but really, she looks like my youngest sister, and you're trying to pass her off as 20?  Work on that for next season, plz.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Honey and Clover's background music is a little odd, but it's amazing at the same time, because they use vocals in a way that I've only heard Bobby McFerrin attempt up till now.  There's also a piano version of either the OP or ED that plays a lot in the series, and is just beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover also uses a lot of insert songs; there's at least one every episode, and they're perfectly fitted to the moments that they're played in.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is just annoying.  I mean, the animation for the first version was absolutely amazing (food + claymation = AWESOME), but the vocalist is kind of shrill, and makes me cringe.   The EDs didn't particularly stand out, but they were nice.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Morita's seiyuu played Takeshi (Brock, for us Americans) in all the seasons of Pokemon, and Hakim in Victorian Romance Emma and Shuuji's seiyu was in Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ and in FFVII: Advent Children as Reno, which was fairly awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all the other seiyuu did an excellent job, as ever.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Twenty-four episodes was a good length; the manga material does go further, and I guarantee that by the time you're finished, you will want more, but the second season should cover that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A beautiful, realistic slice of college life with excellent music and some fairly good seiyuu.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of my top picks.  See this.  NOW.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 46/50; 92% (A)",

            "content": "Honey and Clover is a romance series created by manga artist Umino Chica. In 2005 it was adapted into an anime in 2005 by J.C. Staff. The same studio responsible for Nodame Cantabile and Aoi Hana, which is somewhat promising. As well as Shakugan no Shana, which is pretty discouraging. The only way to see whether this stands with their good romances or their creepily codependent rubbish one is to watch it. So let's check it out. \r\nThe story opens with our protagonist, Izaya (yes, I do know that's not his name, but the characters in this were so dull I never learned their actualnames, even over the course of 24 episodes, so I'm going to refer to them by the names of more interesting characters played by the same actors) anyway, Izaya is spending some time at his apartment with a couple seniors from the same art University, the studious Chrono and the held back slacker, Jean Havoc. Reno, their teacher, brings in a young relative of his, Sayu. The story from their focuses on their everyday lives with particular emphasis on the love triangle involving Izaya, Havoc and Sayu or Chrono's unrequited love for the older Ridget while he tries to deal kindly with Amy's unrequited feelings for him. The biggest problem with the series is just that it's mind numbingly dull. It relies on you caring about the mundane lives of the characters, more on why that doesn't work in the next paragraph, although I'm sure you can figure it out. Most of the story focuses on soap operaesque romance elements and not the entertainingly cheesy type of soap opera in which the main character's evil twin has an affair with his mother-in-law and she thinks it was him or some such absurdity. This is the more mundane variety in which the situation is ordinary but over-blown. In addition to that, everything drags. There's a long scene about the characters looking for the interesting plot ideas... I mean a four leaf clover. The scene ultimately has no impact on anything else that happens either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are bland and one-dimensional. You'd think that a series with a clear character focus would take some time to flesh its characters out and develop them, but Honey and Clover has no time for such things. Instead, it picks a focus trait for each character, whether they're childish, uncertain, slackers or whatever and it never lets them grow or deviate from that. The biggest example is Havoc who gets an easy opening towards the end for some mild development only to elect to remain within the status quo because... developing slightly would interfere with his one character trait. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is... okay. The  faces are drawn kind of oddly. They always look like their mouths are open. The scenery is fine. One thing that is odd is that Sayu's supposedly brilliant art is just incredibly mediocre. It could be a deliberate statement on how mediocrity frequently does get praised as \u201cbrilliant\u201d for inexplicable reasons, but its more likely that they were trying to make art that looked brilliant and that's what they came up with. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is passable. The actors certainly don't give their best performances, but they also don't have much to work with. They still all manage to do their jobs adequately. The music tends toward the soft and peaceful. It functions for the show's aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 2/10. Havoc gets some homo-erotic scenes and there's one rather disturbing scene involving two brothers. The strangest part of that scene is that it has absolutely no purpose nor is it mentioned again. They could've left it out and lost nothing. So... they deliberately hinted at incest for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover is not a bad anime. It's just boring and, mostly, inoffensive. It feels like a creative writing project from a student who's about to graduate and doesn't care anymore. I can really only recommend it if you really like watching dull people go about their lives or you're suffering from insomnia. It may very well bore you to sleep. Final rating, 5/10. Next week, Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro Chan. I know, it's not the first thing in the queue, but everything else is too long to finish in one week.",

            "content": "Note: This review pertains to both Honey and Clover and Honey and Clover II, since II is a direct continuation of the first series.\r\nWhat do you want to do with your life? Where do you want to go? How will you get there? What brought you here in the first place? Honey and Clover, a slice of life josei anime, addresses these types of questions. It tells the story of five friends in an art college and their lives and relationships throughout college (and some of them beyond that) as they face various obstacles. The show does a masterful job at exploring the lives andpersonalities of these five students and the people around them.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I used to prefer shows with super captivating plots where there are distinguishable heroes and villains, Honey and Clover changed my views on that. There isn\u2019t a grand overlaying plot to this series, and yet somehow, I was just as enamored with it as those other shows, if not more. The characters are just regular college students trying to make the most out of those precious years while searching for direction in their lives. They don\u2019t have incredibly bleak pasts, though they\u2019re not without their troubles. Each character has various predicaments that most people would face in that stage of their lives. Takemoto, the protagonist and narrator, is surrounded by highly capable, successful peers, while he seems to be the  most \u201caverage\u201d of his friends. He is the most directionless of the group, unsure of how to proceed after college. He quickly falls in love with Hagumi, an extremely talented painter who has body of a child. Despite her abilities, she is shy and suffers from childlike social anxiety. Then there\u2019s Morita, the most eccentric one. Though he appears to be manipulative, greedy, lazy, and just plain odd, he is surprisingly one of the wiser ones of the friends. His life outside of school is mysterious, and he often has long periods of absences where he inexplicably wanders off and comes back with only a large wad of money and extreme fatigue. We also have Mayama, the first to graduate and get a job, who harbors feelings for a disabled woman who\u2019s had a dark past in regards to relationships. Finally, there\u2019s Yamada, who is in love with Mayama. Even though he constantly rejects her, for some reason, she continues to try.\\n\\n\r\nLike in real life, these aren\u2019t static characters. They\u2019re dynamic. They learn through experience and their mindsets slowly change, for better or for worse. It\u2019s interesting to see them develop this way, as we learn about their pasts and their predicaments.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, although the plot may seem simple enough, this isn\u2019t a straightforward anime. Through its storytelling, it poses several questions and concepts for the viewers to mull over. It teaches us to reflect on our lives and see what brought us to where we currently are. We must cherish the memories with our friends, but eventually, we will have to move on to the next phases of our lives, in which, often times, we will have to depart from our comfortable lifestyles. This is depicted by the constant image of a wheel turning, symbolizing that we must continue forward and adapt. Time is continuous, and thus so is life, and while we should definitely reminisce, we have to live in the ever-changing present instead of in the past.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you\u2019re not into shows that really examine human emotions and relationships, don\u2019t be turned off by Honey and Clover. The show does an excellent job of mixing comedy and drama. On a mere superficial level, this show is hilarious, filled with memorable scenes, most of them brought upon by Morita. You don\u2019t have to indulge in the deeper scenes to enjoy the show. Even if you don\u2019t like the drama, the comedy is more than satisfying enough to be a reason to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, it has a softer feel to it than most other animes due to its watercolor palette. It\u2019s very soothing and natural, and definitely an enjoyable departure from modern conventional animation styles. The music fits the moments well, and while I don\u2019t usually pay attention to OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s, I\u2019ll admit there were a few ED\u2019s I liked that really added to the ending scenes of various episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a realistic depiction of life. It tells a story of unrequited love, overcoming obstacles, acceptance, and ultimately moving forward. We\u2019re able to connect emotionally with the characters, empathizing with them, because most of us have been in situations similar to theirs. It\u2019s not quite tear jerking, but there are definitely many touching scenes that will make your heart feel heavy. Honey and Clover truly is one of the most beautiful and introspective series I\u2019ve seen. It is a simple, yet profound, story about life.",

            "content": "Honestly I only came here because I have only written positive reviews so I felt like ranting about an anime that I thought sucked that apparently every other person on the planet loved. \r\nHoney to goddamn Clover...fuck. Just typing the name irritates me. This review will be short and contain LOADS OF SPOILERS, so stop reading if you do not want that.\r\nAnyway, this whole anime for me was one giant what the fuck. \r\nSo I love romance anime, but I kind of only want the romance anime to go well, which may not be a great trait to have but oh well I'm a sapfor happy endings. OF WHICH THIS ANIME HAS NONE!\\n\\n\r\nSo you got this guy Takemoto, immediately falls for this 8 year old girl who, surprise is actually like 20-something and an art prodigy attending his college. My dude Takemoto is the nicest guy in the fuckin world! And he gets NOTHING. NOTHING I TELL YOU!\\n\\n\r\nSo he is just being his chill self, helping Hagu, or whatever tf her name is, get accustomed to life and the school and everything and she's like \"oh thank you I really appreciate it.\" And here I am thinking \"Okay my boy gettin that 8-year-old-lookin puuuussssss\" \\n\\n\r\nBut then she sees this guy Shinobu's sculpture or some shit like that and meets him for the first time and BAM, she's in love with him. Shinobu falls in love with her too like instantly and thus the love triangle is established. So what happens next? Shinobu disappears for like 2 months (pretty sure I'm being over dramatic here but it was a long time).THE WHOLE TIME, my bro Takemoto is still being the best fuckin' friend to Hagu, doin' everything for her. Helpin' her when she's down. AND SHE GIVES NO FUCKS ABOUT HIM!\\n\\n\r\nThen Shinbou comes back and Hagu is all about him and they kiss and it's bullshit. Then at the end Takemoto is like \"I'm moving because I'm super depressed thanks to you guys, fuck all yall\" and they are just like \"Who tf is Takemoto again?\"\\n\\n\r\nSeriously this dude was so poorly treated. I have never seen someone go from Goku to fuckin' Krillin so quick. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is this other love story between AGAIN this really supportive, amazing girl, and this dude who's in love with his terminally ill boss or something. EVEN THE BOSS IS LIKE \"Dude, this chick is amazing and wants you so bad and supports you so much.\" And he's like eh, fuck her. \\n\\n\r\nI said this would be a rant and I got pretty into it by the end there. Anyway, TL:DR,\\n\\n\r\nThe characters treat each other so fuckin shittily and in the end it's one of those \"Everyone was happy because they realized how important friendship is and they all got closure\" Oh bull-fucking-shit. Takemoto probably offd himself a week later, and everyone else was still probably depressed because nobody ended up with the person that they were in love with. \\n\\n\r\nOh, except the chick who moved on from the dude in love with the terminally ill chick. THAT GIRL WAS THE ONLY SANE ONE! And she was the only reason I kept watching. Fuckin; hated Hagu man...hated that bitch.",

            "content": "Honey and Clover is one of the few slice of life series that deals with matters such as love and friendship very maturely, the everyday life quite realistically and the resolution with a better perspective. \r\nIt is hard for me to decide to give this show a number. With little bias in mind, with the satisfaction I received, with the delightful sound tracks, it is easy for me to give this show a 10. And my advice is, don't look at the numbers, but actually understand the wonderful story the show has to offer, the beautiful story where the little things in life are highlightedas we glance through the life of these college students, mainly Yuuta Takemoto. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses gradually as we move further, with blurry episodic start followed by some more deeply curved story and something much more seriousness. Life as student can be difficult for many, due dates and demanding qualities, things are much more complicated for art college students. However, even with their hardships, poverty as students, and love that is almost dream, the protagonists enjoys their little time they have, the time they have together. Teasing and praising, the protagonists are very likable, and for many, relatable. The triangles of love, the unrequited feelings, and the painful evenings are all that the story includes. Within the funny atmosphere, the story is heart-warming and sometimes very aspiring. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, they develops through the series. Their collaboration, their silent feelings, their goals and emotions, their dreams, the story explores them all. Friendship to put over love, considerng the other end, and the honesty the characters give makes it impossible for me not to praise them. It is a wonder how smoothly the characters blend together. \\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound are one of the stronger parts of the show. Almost every episode contains one song to accent the emotion along with the superior soundtracks. The strum of the guitar, the soft piano sound along with the calm melodies, the music does a excellent job at uplifting the mood. The opening is decent, but becomes more meaningful the further the story goes. The first ending, Waltz, is probably one of the best ending music I've heard in anime, and by best, I mean how perfectly it fits and portrays the show. The second ending is quite mediocre, but fitting near the end. Voice acting for the show was likable, calm voices, good laughs. But at some point, one may find the emotional scenes are quite exaggerated. \\n\\n\r\nArt. The art is not heavily detailed, not exaggerated, not eye-candy. The art is simple, soft, and intended for a softer approach. The serious scenes are drawn with care, and given finer details whereas the comical scenes are less detailed, with rounder faces and sketchy eyes. J.C. staff does a fine job at relating the art with the story, and the animation is quite reputable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Honey and Clover is a wonderful show. It will uplift the audience, makes them laugh or cry or feel the characters, which is done by an excellent show, one which the audience welcomes and enjoys. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some may say I like every anime that I watch but something about Honey and Clover really made me smile. Its about a group of students who attend an Art University, trying to become something related to art and creativity. Within this storyline you have love triangles, strange characters (Morita mostly *laughs*), and lots of character plots which allow you to become more enveloped with them on an almost personal level.\r\nYou could say the main character is Takemoto, a striving artist who is still struggling to find out what type of future he\\'ll have. He moves into a dorm-like apartment not far from the campusand meets several other students; Morita, who is a super-artist though when you see him, you wouldn\\'t know it due to how he reacts to things. He\\'s very motivitated by money and stardom. Mayama, an older student who has a love for a woman named Rika, who\\'s husband had passed away in a car accident, and she was badly hurt. Hagu who\\'s a tiny little woman, almost elf-like but full of amazing art skills and innocence, striving to just happily draw. Yamada, a pottery student, who volunteers at the university and in turn is allowed to use the kiln to create her works. The love triangles are between Hagu, Takemoto, and Morita, then Rika, Yamada, and Mayama. It seems that both Takemoto, and Morita fell in love with Hagu and the story goes from there, and Yamada despretely loves Mayama, but Mayama doesn\\'t want anything to do with it, and instead follows Rika, who fears hurting him (or claims she already has).\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the storyline you learn of their lives, meet other characters that help with the story and how everyone lives have become to what they have. For anyone looking to have a somewhat serious anime, but still with laughs and stories to make you cry, I really recommend this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the first of two seasons (unless there\\'s 3 and I just haven\\'t found out about it yet).",

            "content": "It is not uncommon to worry about the future. What is my purpose in life? How will I change as a person and affect both my loved ones and those around me? Questions like these are thought about frequently and many begin to come to terms with the answers to these questions in their university years. Hachimitsu to Clover, or Honey and Clover, explores this idea, mixing in romance and relationships for a nice slow paced slice of life; it tells the tale of a group of college friends and colleagues as they spend their days growing close to each other, dealing with the outsideworld and work, and coming to terms with what they want out of life and their own desires. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Honey and Clover stand out from the typical high school rom-com slice of life is the fact that it takes on a much more serene and mature tone compared to the often crazy, silly, and awkwardness you might in other slice of life anime. Honey and Clover does an excellent job of drawing and evoking a variety of emotions out of the watcher. From laughing at Shinobu drive Takemoto and Mayama up a wall, to smiling at the genuine and caring Professor as he watches over Hagu, to frustration over Yamada and Mayama's relationship; there is never a dull moment. For anyone who's watched their fair share of slice of life, Honey and Clover pulls the genre off in a refreshing and unique matter and offers something new.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover does an excellent job of utilizing the characters' unique personalities and habits to create a realistic portrayal of everyday college life. From the crazy genius Shinobu who seems to be talented at many things but doesn't really care about utilizing it to the fullest to Takemoto, who on a whim chose to major in architecture because he liked making things with his hands, each character has their own set of problems that the series explores. The clash between desires and expectations is the overlying theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama and romance aspect of the show can be frustrating at times, but is a more accurate representation of relationships in real life. Often times in anime one can predict the flow of romance and relationships, such as who will end up with who, and the feelings and emotions come in a nice superficial box with a neat bow tie on top. However, relationships in real life are often different. Unlike in most romance and drama shows, love in real life does not always go the way you want it. It is more bitter, more mature. It can be extremely frustrating. It can be confusing and hectic. Honey and Clover does a very nice job of representing this through a solid cast of characters and exploring each individual's feelings for one another.\\n\\n\r\nOne last theme this show explores is natural talent and feelings of inferiority. In our world, there will always be an insurmountable gap between those of us who are truly talented and gifted, and those who are on the more ordinary side of things. Hard work and dedication can only close that gap so much. Honey and Clover shows how individuals both talented and ordinary think about this fact, and the problems that come with being on either side of the spectrum. Through the relationships of Takemoto, Hagu, Professor, and Shinobu, aspects such as expectations, guidance, free will, and desires are all laid out and explored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very simple and easygoing on the eyes. There is no flashy animation, just very basic yet powerful scenes and warm colors. The music complemented the mood being presented in each scene and was never out of place. There were lively pieces to accompany merry times and happy days, and somber tones to accentuate tension and dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover gives us a fresh perspective of the slice of life genre. Through mellow and slow-paced storytelling, the tale of this group of college students comes to life, and will make you feel as if you're living right alongside them. For those who tire of conventional slice of life romantic comedies with little to no substance, Honey and Clover might just be right for you.\\n",

I dont think this anime will ever pull me inif Hagu is the main love interest..Maybe it gets better if you are into children. lol i'm not. *shrug* Maybe if i'm that bored i'll decide if i want to watch a bit further since only two of the characters amused me at the beginning.",

            "content": "Wow. Honey and Clover is a somewhat long series (considering it has two series), and watching all of it is definitely time-consuming, but I guarantee that it will be worth it. \r\nStory: 9/10.  I can definitely say, without a doubt, that this is the most inspirational and moving anime I've ever seen. At times, there is that typical shoujo-romance thing going on, but other than that, everything else is just too amazing for words. Also, the story is a bit plain at times, but I loved it nonetheless. It's very unique in its own ways -- the way it creates dramas, the way therelationships work all fit perfectly well into the storyline.  It had a very calm atmosphere, yet there was enough drama to keep you watching. I love it. I couldn't ask for it any other way. :)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. I thought the OP and ED were done well, the characters were drawn cutely, and the animation was good. :) No complaints here. I love the very soft atmosphere the animation gave me. It was soft and warm feeling.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. I listened to the soundtrack and I have to say I am IN LOVE with it! The music is probably one of the best features of this show. The calm relaxing acoustic music blended very well with the relaxing scenes. Suga Shikao's music felt right at home.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10.  I thought each character in the story was unique in their own way and were all well-developed. I loved Hagu's shyness, Shuuji's parent-like personality, Takumi's maturity and understanding, Morita's crazy self, etc. I thought every personality was great and fit the characters in the story amazingly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. The story was great, everything was beautifully done, and this anime was definitely awe-inspiring for me. There were a lot of scenes that, after watching it, made me think about life. Definitely recommended for everyone to watch. I gave it a 9/10 because at parts, it was a bit slow, and I thought there were some parts that could have been more fast-paced.",

            "content": "Spurred by good reviews to watch this anime, I picked it up and continued to watch hoping that the reviews would be justified. Towards the end, I toughed it out, but was ultimately greatly disappointed.\r\nIn a nutshell, this anime is a bore to watch. Unless you count graduating from college and getting a job as exciting and significant developments, every character is almost in the exact same spot they were in at the beginning of the series.\r\nWatch one episode and you basically get the gist: A bunch of friends in art school talk,  eat (a lot), get drunk (a lot), pine after this oneor that one, cry (one character seems to cry every episode, almost every 5 minutes), fervently work on art pieces, go to festivals, take field trips, have inner monologues, and don't address what is really on their minds to the ones who need to hear it. Their failures to communicate prevents them from making breakthroughs which serve to slow any development to a snail's pace artificially.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to watch adults fall in love with a character that looks and acts like a child, do not waste your time with this series. I expected the show to address why the character is this way and show every other character be conflicted about the attraction to her, but that didn't happen. Even if they did address the attraction, it is akin to mentally mature adults pursuing a mentally challenged adult. No bueno.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the show intended to continue after the 36th episode, but, as of now,  it didn't sufficiently tie up some of the threads that I was concerned about in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI liked how this anime looks, but the first 24 episodes seemed to have looked better than the last 12. The cartoonish expressions the characters often make gets to be too much for me though. The voice acting and sound design are the best things about this anime for me by far.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, I didn't enjoy this series, I obviously won't re-watch it, and I strongly do not recommend it.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nFrom an early age, people often have their own dreams and aspirations. Kids may want to grow up to be astronauts or they may want to be super famous in the world of sports. But as they mature, reality sets in and they begin to worry less about their future and more about the present. With this shift in mentality comes an important question: what is truly, in my heart of hearts, important to me? Honey and Clover sets up as a nice slice-of-life show in order to answer this ever-lingering thought.\r\nSTORY\r\nHC stars a main cast of five:Takemoto, Morita, Hagu, Yamada, and Mayama. Starting off in Takemoto's early years of college, the show progresses over many months and years to show the characters dealing with everyday events.\\n\\n\r\nThis is by far one of the most slice-of-life shows I have ever witnessed. There is absolutely no overall arc to be had within the story. Even more so is the distinct lack of connection between the stories per episode. Things happen in a chronological order, but nothing in one episode truly affects what happens in the next. For this reason, much of the season is simply the characters hanging at festivals, drinking at parties, or conversing at work. Meaning, they literally showcase the characters doing their everyday activities. There's no intense action or heavy drama, it's just the whole gang getting by, day by day.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, the show is very character driven. It likes to explore the characters and how they are feeling with the consistent use of narration by a variety of the cast. In this way, we not only get to see how they are really feeling but also how they interact with one another while hiding their true selves. Speaking of selves, an important aspect of the show is this idea of \"self-realization.\" Each of the main cast struggle with their real identity. They have these ideas and emotions that they want to convey properly, but due to their lack of understanding or inability to succinctly express their feelings, they tend to wall themselves off more than they would like to. This is something that the show does very nicely and for each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems with the show is just how slow everything is. Despite jumping ahead in time on numerous occasions, you never really feel as if any progress is actually made. Besides the ending, once everything starts it stays almost exactly the same for the entirety of the season. And being such a character-driven show, this lack of realization on almost everyone's part feels quite tedious in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nHC is now roughly ten years old, but it still holds up quite well even when compared to today's standards.\\n\\n\r\nPart of HC's appeal is its art style. The best word to describe it is that everything looks \"soft.\" The colors that are there are not loud, the locations are standard, and the details are neither sharp nor dull. It gives off this mellow vibe that works pretty well with the actual tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual animation, I found this one to be a bit harder to describe. For the most part, the animation is average. With lots of dialogue and characters sitting around, there isn't much of a chance for the show to showcase anything spectacular. However, it can do reasonably well when it is showing character movements or when it is going through one of its comedy bits.\\n\\n\r\nAs for character designs, I found them to be quite likable. They all look \"appropriate\" for not only their age but for who they are as people. Mayama is mature and kind, Yamada is beautiful and emotional, Morita is handsome and outgoing, etc. The show does a nice job of making these characters feel \"real\" enough so that we as an audience could potentially believe that such characters could exist somewhere out there in the world.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nSticking to just the big five, I enjoyed all of the characters minus one.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the least of the best, Takemoto is somewhat the MC for the show; he's often the one who narrates what is going on. He's determined, selfless, and generally unsure of himself. For almost the entire season, he acts as an almost \"fifth-wheel.\" Rather than acting he merely observes everyone else. So for the majority of the show, I honestly did not care for him. However, by the show's end, he managed to make a lasting impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nMayama represents the leader of the group. More mature in both personality and age when compared to the rest, he generally avoids trouble by hiding his emotions. This creates a lot of the issues he has with the characters around him, but what's unique is that he knows (from himself and from those that tell him) that he is like this.\\n\\n\r\nMorita is undoubtedly the most interesting character in the group. Unintentionally direct and completely carefree, he is more often than not the one who reveals the gang's true feelings, all the while suppressing his own. He easily makes you laugh throughout the show due to his crazy antics, and provided much needed breaks in the overall slowness.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character from season one was Yamada. Smart, beautiful, and caring, she is the epitome of the perfect woman. And yet, her feelings of love have a difficult time reaching who they are meant for. Her struggle is hard to watch at times, simply because its a battle that she is constantly losing but always getting back into. When she isn't feeling down, she too provides a great amount of comedy and variety to the show that I greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe character I found to be the worst was actually Hagu. Besides just not really liking her personality and character interactions, she doesn't really do anything of importance. While she may be the focus of some of the characters at certain points in the season, her actions never have any meaning or consequence. To put it simply, she's rather boring and uninteresting when competing with the other four characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nHC is strange in that it has one OP but two EDs. The OP has a great amount of singing in its range, but I never found the OP to be to my liking. Furthermore, it doesn't even really fit with the show, its just too \"grandiose\" in its vocal ability. As in, it's not mellow enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe first and second ED are somewhat similar. I found them to be okay, but they were more aligned with how the show felt. The singing and beats themselves are rather plain but in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was quite nice, especially the piano piece that the show liked to use a lot. I actually found the soundtrack to be of better quality than what the OP and EDs had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, there was no stand-out performances. Instead, I actually did not enjoy Haruka Kudou's voice for Hagu. Something about it just didn't really seem to fit with her character.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest and say that this one was somewhat hard to get through. I enjoy a good slice-of-life, but HC can be really hard to like since there is almost nothing going on at any given time. And even when something happens, neither the story nor the characters progress in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy at times was hit or miss. One of my favorite scenes was the Twister game simply due to how over-the-top Morita made it. I also enjoyed seeing Yamada beat up Mayama every single time for just being him.\\n\\n\r\nRomance is one of the show's selling points, and here as well it was hit or miss. The Yamada, Mayama, and Rika love triangle was executed nicely while the Hagu, Morita, and Takemoto love triangle was not. The former was interesting in its direction but the latter lacked anything tangible to even consider. In other words, the first triangle was fleshed out while the second triangle felt tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Honey and Clover focuses on two things: oneself and nothing at all. As a slice-of-life it does its job, but the lack of anything significant occurring, besides the ending, makes the whole experience a tough one to get all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, super slice-of-life at a snail's pace\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, soft art style with decent animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, all but Hagu are nice characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OP and ED are okay, soundtrack is good, VAs are average\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, romance and comedy are hit or miss making it tough to get through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "Minor spoilers for honey and clover, so be warned.\r\nAfter the personal turmoil of an experience that was watching 3-gatsu no lion, I found myself needing more. As I have stated on another review, that you can look for, if you are interest for more in-depth thoughts, 3-gatsu has managed to become one of my favorite pieces of fictions. So it is only natural, that after that I would be looking for the authors other works, at worst to see how she has evolved as writer, at best to get a close experience. On that note, there was another highly regarded work from author umino chika,and the purpose of this review is to discuss it, honey and clover, and to make some assessments on her general writing style, by comparing it with her later work. Does it hold up to the lofty expectations I created for her, is it able to fulfill my dose of her endless sentimental style of storytelling, at least until her other work, becomes my favorite anime from 2018?\\n\\n\r\nYouth, the age of the rose colored spring of life. That magic time where everything seemed possible and achievable. I am sure you have heard all this idealistic bullshit about the period, but maybe it sounds like that, when you are way older. This is show is basically a very earnest and heartfelt representation of this age. In here we see the coming of age of our 5 main characters, all offering their own unique spin and personal perspective on the topic. One aspect that helps to sell this portrayal is the setting where this takes in, not some high school but a freaking college. Yes, you heard it right, this does not take place in a generic high school as every school comedy ever, but instead in an art college to be more specific. This is important not only because this is the time period I am current living in, so the image of a bunch of broken young adults living together, and doing their best with limited money is immensely relatable to me, believe me it is. But it also adds so much to the story. There is the sense of urgency and importance to the characters conflicts you can only find it in this setting, acts like choosing a career and joining the workforce are right around the corner for this characters, which are life changing moments and decisions. It is a time of change, you can have to go to another town to get the college, find yourself living with completely new people, maybe even sustaining yourself, having lots of different and more serious concerns. It is no wonder that change is such a big issue for the characters themselves. And the show really commits to this representation of the period, there is such an immense degree of situations and emotions being presented, the search for meaning and direction in life, the friendships, the romance, the rejections, the insecurity, the separations, reencounters. And guess what they sell it hard on every emotion, the character\u2019s interactions are so honest and endearing that the viewer itself starts seeing them as their friends and loves just to see them hang out together, it evokes the same feeling of having this unique and special group of friends. It may be melodramatic and annoying but those sure are valid and important feeling, we all felt at the time, we all though what we were going through, was the most important and serious thing ever. The variety in situations is also important, there is something for everyone to relate here, be it Takemoto aimlessness and search for a path in life, morita inability to let go of his past and connect with others, yamada failings in here romantic connections, Hagu trauma for her abuse as a child and how that affects her. There is something for everyone to grab that can relate and resonates deeply with their own experiences (which is kind of one of my main negative points). Not only our main characters add a lot to this, seeing the secondary character\u2019s perspective can also be very enlightening. There is a duo of old teachers that observe Takemoto, to him the work he was making was a pointless and worthless representation of his lack of purpose in life. They themselves recognize it as such, and they love it for that, it leads them to the memories of their own younger selves, as they were dealing with the time, it might seem like though worthless period at the time but it is very precious to them as they grow older, they feel very nostalgic about it. Another aspect is how most older characters\u2019 act, like nomiya and hanamoto, it is their older age and experience that leads them to be better at dealing with their issues and emotions that weight our mains, to the point they usually act for emotional support to them.\\n\\n\r\nYou know, many would think I am being facetious when saying that clover takes place at a time of grandiose changes in our characters\u2019 lives, because pretty much nothing really changes that much since the start of this anime. The passage of time is acknowledging sure, days, months seasons and even years pass by, this story takes places during several years of our character\u2019s lives. But the main core and dynamic of our main characters, their struggles and most of the background characters, still remains relatively unchanged by this story course. I have two ideas of why that is the case, one is that this is just laziness of the author, trying to keep the status quo, just to keep the story going as much as possible. But I still believe those are methodically planned and used to portray what I really believe is the main idea brought forward in this story. The main motifs this show used are the Ferris wheel, the main oppressive imaginery that seems to inhabit a lot of our characters imagenery, and the bicycle, (also that spinning cuck marker that I have no idea what it is) that is not only Takemoto means of escape, it is also an object that dominates his thoughts. Both of those show circular imagenery that points out to the cyclic nature of life, this show is portraying. No matter how much our characters struggle they also end up at approximately the same place, all in a never ending cycle, with only the feeling of regret for not accomplishing what they desire, at the end of the line. Takemoto is probably the biggest case for this, his literal journey is not only of searching for his true self as the characters in the show point out, by seeing how far he can go he wants to break this cycle, what path and decision in life he can do to actually make the change he want to make in the world, (his confession, finding a job) actually happen and getting rid of the uncertainty, his future has. Changing yourself in clover is not impossible though, both Takemoto and mayama have remarkable aspects of that, and this ties back to the topic of growing up. Mayama\u2019s case is also really interesting, the guy at the start of the series is obsessed with the appearance of maturity, smoking, drinking being kind of reliable to his friends, just looking cool. He believes this is a sign of growing up, he will impress rika, the more mature woman he is in love with that, his insecurity holding him back to actually get closer to her. When he acknowledges the flaws in himself, and starts doing the best he can for her, regardless of any appearances, regardless of how pathetic he may end up looking in her eyes, Mayama finally gets it, he matures a little and finally starts breaking the cycle he is in. Takemoto also grows as a person, he finally stops worrying about grandiose questions like the meaning of life, no one is able to give him answers, he found the value of those around him, and can support the uncertainty of his future by sharing it with others. Not really related, but I wanted to say I love the idea of how hollow he feels being represented by this monotone noise he hears at his home, I swear I have felt the exact same thing, in regards to the noise my refrigerator makes. Facing change is frightening, you never know where it can lead, or how you will end in the process, it is something difficult to put forward, maybe as much as growing up, but finally acknowledging and making those things you so dearly desired happen is definitely worth it. Takemoto still got a sense of satisfaction out of his acts, despite the fact he really got rejected in the end, he made something great, and was proud of it regardless. This a stance and idea, I would love to be able to do myself, in my own life.\\n\\n\r\nI do intend to use umino Chika (thanks for being alive and working btw) newer product, 3-gatsu, to shed some light into my bigger issues with this anime. While both were very similar in tone, the signatures of heavy handed sentimentality, the abrupt tone shifts, she is probably the only author, that blends so perfectly moments where I am close to tears, and moments where I am laughing my ass of, in a single episode. Like really both in 3-gatsu and in clover, chika is great at writing comedy. Never the comedy feels out of place, intrusive to the drama, or even downright insulting, like in shows like shitgatsu. And I just love how not mean spirited it is always, this sensation of this loveable characters teasing each other is just so heartwarming and perfect, I was sad to see this aspect take a back seat latter in the show. The variety in tones, and how perfectly she captures each one them is one of her greatest strengths as a writer, she is just so great at creating pathos and making it feel earned out of the most mundane situations. This is also complemented in clover by the usage of music, which was crucial for this anime. Half of what made most of the better moments in the anime work so well, was the complement of an atmospheric, and compelling soundtrack, some of the tracks in this conveyed the feeling of scenes, with the music alone. The decision of having dialogue and plot take a backset, for more atmospheric scenes, where the tracks would be the focus really paid off, making for some of the memorable and intense moments in this anime. Clover has one of my favorite soundtracks in anime, heck I could keep listening to it all day. But 3-gatsu no lion has a way narrower focus, it is first and foremost rei\u2019s story, while clover shifts perspective between our 5 different main characters. And really the scope of themes clover has going for it is also way larger, there is an infinitude of themes with lots of characters adding their own little perspective to the mix, excluding sexuality, that is taboo in this show. But you know what, that variety usually does not work to the shows advantage, most of the themes and ideas being thrown around are not being explored in meaningful ways. Like for example, there is a segment when they go about, the feelings of loneness Takemoto is having, what comes out of it? A poetic monologue about how this is something everyone feels at certain moments in their lives, always coming and going, that is it. No insight or exploration of such a serious and important aspect of life. Ideas like these are being thrown around constantly, and not much of them gets the attention they deserve. This theme exploration is not entirely bad on itself, if anyone that is passing through those periods of life, can get one or two little insights about a personally important topic, but it still pales in comparison to 3-gatsu, which has a way more focused storyline and fully develops most themes it brings forward. Compared to 3-gatsu shows rei loneness, and how much it adds to the story and is explored, it also helps that 3-gatsu is way subtler about its set of themes, clover sometimes has those mentor older characters, explain the whole point the author is trying to make in length, which makes me think I am watching oregairu again. And that is never a good thing. Also this taking place in an art project, but rarely ever focusing on the creative process, value of art, or the mindset of artists is really a missed opportunity. Yes, I in general prefer 3-gatsu to clover, and maybe it all comes to me being kind of similar to rei as a person, only once before have I seen such a relatable character, that was a haunting and beautiful representation of what I was feeling at the moment, but I do find it have greater value and storytelling overall.\\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend this show? Absolutely yes. If you are looking for a more mundane and heartwarming take on teenage life, especially if you are going through this period yourself, this is the anime for you. I am surprised this is in fact not loved for more people, it manages to portray so beautifully this turmoil of emotions, that make up a big part of our lives, with good character writing, and lots of important and resonating life lessons. I would really expect this to be even life changing for some. It may not be the perfect masterpiece, I found Umino Chika younger work to be, and this season may only conclude one-character arc, so not sure if the next season finishes the story, but I hardly found it to be unsatisfying as an ending. Clover is a wonderful journey; I will remember fondly for a long time. Also God bless Umino Chika now officially my new favorite mangaka. May she keep blessing us, with those amazing manga (which I have not seen any, just watched anime adaptations), that make me feel so happy, fulfilled and motivated, which will always be a safe heaven, and stop point, when I feel reality becomes a little too hard to handle. Thank you so much.\\n",

Happiness, in general, can be achieved quite easily; receiving an unexpected gift, having great success in your career, and most especially, falling in love.

Failure comes with success, bitterness come with love. These are bundled facts in life that no human being is immune to.

Takemoto and his continuous journey to find himself, Morita and his path to revenge, Hagu and her desire in becoming a great artist, & Mayama and Yamada in their pursuit for the love of the ones they love *smirk*. These stories are all really interesting because they are so realistic. It tells the viewers throughout the series that not all things in life go how they want it to be. The sad reality that there will always be someone better than you, and that love can sometimes be one-sided. However, in spite of the \u201cnegative\u201d side of the show, there\u2019s this mysterious magic that appears almost after each depressing scenes. It feels like a figurative pinch in the heart. As I\u2019ve said, a beautiful tale of happiness and sadness. You will feel happy and sad at the same time while holding back tears of... I don\u2019t even know. There\u2019s one time I felt sad and happy at the same time so it\u2019s really difficult to describe the right feeling. A really good show if you want to feed birds at a park while feeling empty inside. Not a bad price to pay for an amazingly good show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n\tBecause there are many main characters in the series, I will avoid talking about a specific character in general. So, yeah, I\u2019ll start. \\n\r\nIn spite of my continuous bitching about the show\u2019s sometimes depressing atmosphere, it might be hard to believe that every character in this series also have a fun and fluffy side to them as well.  Every character might (and WILL) send tears running down your cheeks, but always remember that these tears are not limited to only the emotional moments, they can also make you cry out tears of joy (A little bit of an overstatement, but you know what I mean) with all the really funny comedy. Some might love them, some may not, but you will surely get attached to them in just a couple of episodes throughout their long journey.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\n\tThe animation for both series of Honey and Clover was done by J.C. Staff, famous for works such as Ano Natsu de Matteru, Golden Time, Nodame Cantabile, and my all time favorite anime: Eiken. The animation for this show is pretty standard compared to most of their show but that\u2019s understandable because not much special effect is used. It\u2019s a simple slife (slice of life) romance show. It doesn\u2019t have bombastic scenes like Shana\u2019s flames (Random tangent. J.C. Staff\u2019s fire is probably the sexiest fire in current time. If KyoAni made water look sexy, J.C.\u2019s selling point is fire. *points to Shana, Index, and Witch Craft Works*) or Nodame\u2019s 3D orchestration so it\u2019s pretty simple, though, not bad. I kinda hated the character designs but that\u2019s a personal thing. It feels a little too shoujo/jousei-ish for my taste but its fine. As my policy goes, Even if the animation/character designs are bad, if the story is good, I\u2019ll watch it. So, yeah, cool.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t think I should be reviewing this section because personally, I don\u2019t have confidence in my taste in music. I like music, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good judge in this field. So, don\u2019t hold it against me if my opinion in music is that bad. Now that\u2019s out of the way, maestro, music! \\n\r\nSince I rarely listen to whole anime soundtrack, I\u2019ll bring this down on the actual music that was used in the show. I\u2019ll start with the OPs. OP 1 was really amazing. Nakushita yakusoku wa hoshi\u2026. Enough on my weeabo karaoke. lol. Anyway, that OP was really good not only because of the music but also because of the visuals. What a really fun foodporn. I never once skipped that OP which made me sad once it got replaced. I wish the OP stayed the same throughout the whole series. You know, like what they did with Log Horizon 2\u2019s OP; new foodporn but same music. In regards to the music used on the show, I can\u2019t quite remember it except the mellow piano version of the OP during emotional moments, then that wacky party like tune used during funny moments. Those ones were really well used. Though repetitive, it fits the moment perfectly and adds to the overall feel of the show. And allow me to make a confession, I rarely watch EDs (I watch a show\u2019s ED once then that\u2019s it). With that said, I don\u2019t really have anything to say with the ED since I don\u2019t remember it, I just remember a Ferris wheel and that\u2019s it. lol. In regards to the dub in both sides, I haven\u2019t seen the English dub yet so I\u2019ll limit this in the japo dub side. Since I can\u2019t understand much Japanese, I\u2019d probably say it\u2019s a good dub. Hiroshi Kamiya, one of my favorite seiyuu played as Takemoto. Kamiya always has this weird accent but in Honey and Clover he used the dialect from Osaka and it was just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\n\tNow, after pulling random numbers out of my ass (8.6 for story, 8.4 for characters, 7.3 for animation, 8.2 for music, and 9 for overall enjoyment), I\u2019ll gladly give Honey and Clover with an overall score of [b]8.3[/b]. Honey and Clover is a show that really excels in making you feel like crap in the rain, but tells you that once the rain stopped, you\u2019ll be mixed in the water, evaporate, become rain, fall in a river, then be made as a drinkable water (What the fuck did I just made up?). Uhhhh, If I somewhat gave you a trauma because of that scenario, feel free to kill me in my sleep. Anyway, back on topic. Yeah, Honey and Clover is an amazing show, if you haven\u2019t seen it yet, you have my full-blown recommendation. Go on, watch it, but just be warned of the void in your heart that will come once you finish it.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation, why don\u2019t you try Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo? Both shows are pretty similar in the \u201cYou\u2019re shit. You have no talent. Go die in a fire.\u201d section. Though, slight spoiler, Sakurasou has too many depressing moment. If Honey and Clover pinches your heart, Sakurasou will stab your heart. Both have pretty decent comedy too. The romance in both series is really unsatisfying but cute. And they\u2019re both made by J.C. Staff too.\\n\\n\r\nYou can also try Nagi no Asukara if you want too. Though not as depressing as Honey and Clover, Nagi no Asukara have some rather sad moments as well that might make you shed a tear. Another important thing to point out is that both series have love n-gons (not just triangles. Not just squares. They have too many to even count) that went completely nowhere.\\n\\n\r\n\tWell, that\u2019s it for me, thanks if you read all of that. I might do this again if I have the chance to. If you like it, feel free to send me a PM if you want me to review other shows. I\u2019ll see you (whoever\u2019s reading this) around. Bye-nara!",

            "content": "I first picked up Honey and Clover one school break during my college days, during the days when all I can think about is friendship/love/pressure to succeed/family woes, and then I found an image of myself in the story. This is how Honey and Clover succeeds to become a heart-warming slice of life series, I think it gave me a glimmer of hope despite the fleeting nature of youth, HnC assures me that you can make wonderful memories even when youth is long gone.\r\nThe pace of HnC is slow, but relaxing. It is animation in poetry form, the details and soft colours paint a character'smood or scenario and the feelings slowly flood your senses. Then there is the calming voice of Takemoto speaking in the background and his narration becomes the frame of the painting, piecing everything together. Beautiful and carefully hand-picked soundtracks by the mangaka herself are laced into the anime and I believe the songs were chosen for their lyrics which never fail to reflect the innermost emotions the featured characters are going through that moment in time. Just with these few elements, I'm constantly amazed and blown away by the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut the story is what keeps you on your toes, despite the slower pacing, the twists and circumstances of every character captures you and sometimes what they experience is an incident I can relate to and I find myself cheering/crying for the character. Humour is often used to balance the mood, just the way we would in real life, and some the characters will send you in tears, while laughing. Because...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the story are so diverse and well-developed you will love them all, if not you'd love at least a few of them. There is the timid but talented Hagu-chan who conquers her lack of courage through her emotive paintings, nice guy Takemoto is a good friend to all but lonely at times when his willpower is shaken, Morita is a crazy blitz you can't help laughing at but his mysterious nature also pulls you in, Mayama the big brother torn between woes of loving and being loved, Yamada the naive girl who is crazy for Mayama and constantly has her heart broken, and of course Shu-chan the caretaker who watches over the group and sometimes nostalgia creeps up to him and he find himself missing his good friends from college. These are the primary characters, but revolving each of them are many more characters so different and colourful, you may just feel something familiar with any one of them too.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie, Honey and Clover remains one of my favourite series in print and motion form, and I've lost count of the number of times I re-watched the series so I may sound like one of those fans who will protect the series at all cost. However, while some may love the action-packed theme anime series out there, I believe some of us are also searching for that one anime that speaks to our inner emotions. When I re-watch HnC now, long past those youthful college days, whatever I have felt years ago while watching the series I can still feel them strongly if not even more strongly than before. It is a timeless art piece in the anime genre and as it sums up in one of my favourite quote from the series - \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAs time passes, the day will come when everything will fade to memories. But those miraculous days, when you and I, along with everyone else, searched together for just that one thing, will continue revolving forever somewhere deep in my heart, as my bittersweet memory.\u201d",

            "content": "The key to happiness is something we humans long to find in our short time in this earth. It's something that can't be seen nor touched, but we want to find it. A way we find this key is to go through our lives searching it, but like a four-leaved clover, it takes some fumbling around the grass to find it. In Honey and Clover, our main characters do just that, fumbling around life to find that key to happiness while life keeps going forward, no matter if they find it or not. \r\nWhile this is a story of not battles to save the world,nor about a meaningless crush on the transfer student, but a story about a battle, the battle we all have inside of us to find our what is truly our own unique meaning here in life and the love that while bittersweet, it taught us about love.  This story is relateble to all of us as we follow a group of art college students going to life looking for their key to happiness and the battle that ranges inside us as we go through our lives looking for that key.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is very compatible to the story in more ways than your usual anime. While most anime has the normal bold look, this anime uses a watercolor look to it that makes it soft looking, which really goes with the flow of the anime, which is slow paced.\\n\\n\r\nFor the music, it uses mostly slow rock or some pop that really fits with the theme and flow of the story. It uses a lot of music, that ranges in types, from rock to jazz, but while it seems to be a lot, they all go with the story's flow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a really important thing for any story, anime or manga. They are what projects the story's feeling and flow. If the characters don't show anything, it's just a boring book that doesn't capture our attention.Our main characters show a lot of significance to the story, because without them, Honey and Clover would not made any sense without their feelings to the story.\\n\r\nMayama; playing the role of the cool, intelligent type. He\u2019s always shown smoking and looking off into the distance, giving advice to the other characters,taking care of himself finacially. Of course he's not perfect, jokes are made throughout the anime about his stalker-like admiration for Rika. He\u2019s a bit of both: on one hand, a calm and collected upperclassman, but on the other hand, obsessive and overprotective. \\n\r\nAyumi; In the group, she's the motherly character, helping and caring for her friends. While she may look like a beautiful young woman, on the inside she's like a baby. Completely innocent, she continues to strive for a love that would never work out, but because she's hesitant to cut off that stem, she continues to hurt and not move on. \\n\r\nHagu; while her character's look and act is interesting, her character begins to make a bit more sense when you think how she was brought up, and, more importantly, her love for art. Raised in a enclosed environment,  she was always a distant child, it\u2019s as if she lived in a completely different world, and didn't bother learning the basics of socializing. As a result of that, she looks like a child when compared to her classmates, and she needs someone like Shuu to take care of her like a father. \\n\r\nMorita; My god... this guy can bring comic relief in any situation. However, he also serves as an important part of the group, he's the glue to hold them all together. While he's the \"idiot\u201d type, he's surprisingly very mature and perspective. He\u2019s a bit like Mayama, he helps the other characters out by giving advice and giving them the harsh reality at times. \\n\r\nTakemoto; the everyman character. An interesting guy because he was normal, but it was his ordinary, relatable personality that let his story made what Honey and Clover is. Even though he has no unique traits or abilities to drive him forward, he entered art school, but has no clue as to what he wants to do after he graduates. Because of this and other stress in his life, he built a massive tower, broke it down, and then ride half way across Japan and back.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of \u201cmoving forward\u201d;the flow of time, moving forward always. And the four leafed clover, representing the one \u201cthing\u201d that they were all searching for. In this case, that thing was something more important than a clover, like love, or happiness, but hard to find. Because we are all battling that battle and finding our clovers, it just a matter of falling on the grass and looking for our happiness.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much, it made me think about myself but also made me smile as I watched. I suggest this for all who want to enjoy themselves but also reflect on their lives. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n",

            "content": "My favorite genre of anime has usually been either slice-of-life or romance. This is no exception. It is one of the best romance anime you\u2019ll probably ever see. What makes it so good, is that all the human emotions in it\u2026 they seem so real.\r\nStory\r\nLove is the main part of the story. Any type, you name it: confused love, selfish love, unrequited love, and just plain love. This is such a dramatic anime, but what happens to the characters makes it very realistic. Frustrations of feeling alone, the pressure of everyone around you, the anxieties of where you\u2019ll be in life, are all things thecharacters have to deal with as the progress through the story. It\u2019s one of the sweetest romance stories I\u2019ve come across, actually. There\u2019s no fanservice, rarely a peverted thought. Only the heart-wrenching and bittersweet notion of love.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art, I thought was gorgeous. The animation went long so smoothly, and I loved the color choices, everything looked like watercolors. I also really liked the way the eyes looked, especially of Hagu. They were very pretty an dmade her look doll-like.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great. The ending and opening themes were nice, even though I liked the first ending better than the second ending. I still liked both. The background music was sweet-sounding, a lot of piano music was used of the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all believable.  I ended up disliking some and rooting for others (which is partly why the ending left me dissatisfied though it was predicable). Yamada\u2019s unrequited love for Mayama was understandable, but irritating that he didn\u2019t love her back. I realize you can\u2019t force yourself to love someone. But maybe this is one of the realistic aspects; there are not always happy endings. Anyway, I liked most of the characters. Morita and Yamada were my favorites, I think. Morita is just so unique. It makes me wonder what goes on in his mind. As for Yamada, I felt sorry for her and I kept wanting her to end up with Mayama throughout the series, even though it was easy to see early on that it was sort of hopeless. Takemoto is basically the protagonist, since he narrates the most, even though the story doesn\u2019t focus entirely on him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this took me a while to get through. I started it around in December and I\u2019m just now finishing it in May. Still, just because I took it slowly doesn\u2019t mean it was boring for me. I really did want to finish it, and I\u2019m glad I did because it was a thoroughly  enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very great series, portraying realistic relationships between ultimately believable and likeable characters. I loved it.",

            "content": "Ill try to make this review short and straight to the point.\r\nThe story is simple, yet it allows for amazing develop. It has a great balance between comedy and drama, i found myself laughing at one moment then crying the next. As for the characters, they are some of the most memorable characters in the anime. It is almost impossible not to relate or sympathize with the characters. They each have their own flaws, their own motives and a very realistic personality. In short the characters were three-dimensional. As for the art, it was calming and serene and fit the mood and atmosphere of theshow perfectly. The OST was good, but sadly nothing stood out. Though the opening video is one of the most unique and creative opening I've ever seen.  Overall, i didn't enjoy this show, i loved it-i fell heads over heels for it. Only a few animes left me begging for more, the characters and their interactions, truly unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow time to talk about why u may not like it, AT FIRST.\\n\r\nAs stated previously the plot is simple, don't expect much. Some people may find it extremely boring at first, but bare with it, as the characters will soon draw u into the show and completely immerse you into their world. Finally, Hagu. Yes shes ludicrously short, but aren't there short people in the real world too, so why can't there be one in anime? Also, whats wrong with her being the main character's love interest. She's still a human, and a very cute and talented one. Her looks, first drew Takemoto in. She was unlike anything he'd ever seen and every human to some degree is interested in something new. Finally, her talent was revealed and bam Takemoto fell in love. Takemoto, as shown later in the show, is someone lost, unable to determine what to do in the future, but as for Hagu she already knows. It is because of Hagu's talent and preparedness, that caused Takemoto and Morita to become infatuated and enamored with her (morita's side story is told during the second season). She was Takemoto's inspiration and in Takemoto's eyes a person to look up to and thus Hagu was someone he had to hold close in his life. As for Hagu's behavior early in the show, simply put she's awkward around people. Luckily she begins to feel more comfortable around the rest of the characters and, and becomes a \"normal\" character. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Honey and clover is definitely a 10/10. with flaws too small to notice and a cast as memorable as your first anime. \\n",

            "content": "(This is a review on the entire Honey and Clover franchise, including the OVAs)\r\nWhy is love so bittersweet?\r\nLove, friendship, and jealousy: a simple love story that focuses on the growth and development of an individual from adolescence to adulthood. That is Honey and Clover in a nutshell. Honey and Clover revolves around the daily lives of five college students whose lives are changed when love gets in the way of their affairs. The story starts off, rather slow, with spontaneous comedic outbursts and a nonexistent plot. It is at this point where I wanted to drop it; however, once the fourth episode come around, thethemes of this show become much more apparent, and toward the thirteenth episode of the first season, the comedy aspect of the show starts to fade, eventually taking a backseat in season two.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover truly is a slice of life show. It depicts the many hardships every person goes through as they grow up--lighthearted, funny, sentimental moments we want to treasure in our hearts forever, and the bitterness of unrequited love, jealousy, and betrayal, that we try so hard to forget. These conflicts give a sharp, yet pragmatic tone that resonates deep in the viewers' hearts. \\n\\n\r\nIn today's industry, shows usually rely on useless plot devices to move along the story. This is not the case in Honey and Clover. During each episode, the writer effortlessly tells a tale that is loosely held together by the romance each character wants in their lives. We see each character grapple with love, dreams, and friendship. We see their internal struggles presented to us through raw emotion, which in turn invokes nostalgic memories from the viewer of their childhood days when things were considered brighter and more colorful. The characters in Honey and Clover in one word can be best described as diverse. Honey and Clover decided to do away with the common character archetypes and instead deliver a cast that is realistically simple and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and animation productions in this show is top notch, which is to be expected for a show that revolves around the arts. My favorite soundtracks from this show included a few of the insert songs found through the course of the show, Yamanai Ame, and the opening and ending tracks from both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a down-to-earth slice of life show, look no further. Honey and Clover is one of the best shows in its genre. It is a show that brilliantly captures human emotion and adversity. It is, without a doubt, one of the best you will ever find.",

In this series we&rsquo;ll see the character&rsquo;s struggle to express their feeling, to find what they&rsquo;re really want, to accept a bitter defeat, and face the ugly side of love. \r\nWhile the common Shoujou animes are quietly predictable - the female leading star will get her dream, going out with the leading man, Hachikuro give a hard cold fact that you can&rsquo;t always get what you want. Hachikuro&rsquo;s target audience is the young female adults. The story itself makes us reflects on the life we lead in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing story line, great characterization, beautiful visual and awesome awesome theme songs. Unpredictable ending. Even though the flow of story is rather constant and simple, but it didn&rsquo;t make the audience bored. Hachikuro is the best shoujo anime I&rsquo;ve ever seen.\\n",

I was even excited watching every episodes of it! until... hagu and the slight lovetriangle ruined it for me. Alright believe me I beared with it for a few episodes and continued watching because hell this was a fun anime to watch but as the romance tension is slightly rising up, I couldnt stomach it anymore! I can't imagine two young adults falling inlove with an 18yr old girl who looks and acts like a child! Sorry but Hagu and the romance killed me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Im still giving this a 7 if not for hagu looking like a child this could've been a great anime watch for me, If I had the courage to bear with it more then I would definitely give this series another chance. \\n\\n\r\n(I apologize for the rant) I just can't",

            "content": "I recently decided to rewatch Honey and Clover after having experienced unrequited love, heartbreak, and uncertainties about the immediate future. I felt also that I should rewatch and watch some anime dealing with college, while I\u2019m still in it myself. \r\nI will skip over a synopsis since there already is one. As for talking about the story itself, it is slice of life to its core. Rarely, even in the same genre, can you find a story so mature, realistic, and moving. Few anime deal so much and so heavily with unrequited love, college, and the uncertainties of life. The story is able to showit all and more, as it takes along on its journey, that feels all too real and relatable. Now I will not lie, especially the first few episodes are slow, and it takes a while to really get into the show. But, if you keep with it, you\u2019ll slowly start finding yourself enjoying it, and loving it\u2014relating to it. We must realize that this show is at its core is slice of life, and it does just that showing us the realities of life and all that comes with it. It many ways it is slow, but it\u2019s also fast.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that you must realize, and probably will, is that the show is very philosophical. While I am always writing down quotes from anime, and other media that I watch or read (because I do love quotes) I always find myself writing down much more on a second viewing, and boy did I write a lot of them out. They\u2019re very nice, but you do notice every once in a while how many times the characters dig in and think deeply about life, among other issues. It\u2019s kind of like the show is talking to itself and also talking to us. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the characters make up some of the best parts of the anime. Their connections to each other, their feelings, their lives\u2014it all goes to make them feel real and relatable, but distinct and unique. There is character development, and lots of it\u2014as they move along trying to find themselves, their feelings, and thinking about everything that\u2019s gone on. The characters are really well done. Now I notice many people disliking Hagu, and how she\u2019s small and everything, it got me at first as well, but you get used to it, or should. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique, but not rare. If you\u2019ve seen similar jousei anime/manga like Nodame Cantabile they seem to share a similar feel and style, but it\u2019s also different from it. I ended up enjoying the art style, and felt that overall it had good quality to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is very well done. The first OP is startling and stays with you. I liked almost the entire soundtrack, and the music is distinct enough that it sounds out and you can recognize it and feel connected, without it being overpowering. Though maybe they use a few of the same tracks a lot, but it\u2019s not overpowering\u2014mainly when you recognize it you realize what the anime is trying to convey at that moment, and the song become more memorable since it is distinct and is used more than once. \\n\\n\r\nMy first viewing I watched it dubbed, my second subbed. I can\u2019t say if I prefer one over the other. They\u2019re both good in my opinion, and you can\u2019t go wrong with either one. I felt that for the most part the voices on both dub and sub matched up well with the characters. \\n\r\nThe ending to the first season was well done. While a bit perhaps a bit of a cliffhanger, I can forgive it completely since there is a second season. But it also was a satisfying close to the first seasons as well, had it ended here I would have been a bit disappointed, but also strangely ok. I felt the same way at the end to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment of this anime, I really did enjoy it. I was able to relate to the characters, feel their struggles, and more. If anything I\u2019ve enjoyed it more my second viewing since I\u2019m older now and basically the same age as many of the characters in the anime, at least those in college anyways. In many ways I\u2019ve watched it again at just the right point in my life. Did I find all the answers to my life? No, but to quote the anime \u201cwho cares about an answer? There\u2019s nothing like that to begin with.\u201d I have to say I loved the quotes, and was able to get many of them. It was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite genres is slice of life, and I hold this up as one of the towering standards of the genre that everyone should watch. Sure many other anime in the genre might be \u201cbetter\u201d \u2013 Nodame Cantabile, Natsume Yuujinchou, but I think that Honey and Clover deserves a spot in the must watch category for slice of anime, or just anyone who has experienced unrequited love, uncertainty, college, or life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I like honey and clover, and recommend watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOf note, I typically don\u2019t rate anime\u2014which you will see if you look at my list, but it forces me to rate it to post this review, so I have thought about it what rating I should and have thus accordingly given it. But scores aren\u2019t always everything, though. I say that\u2026\\n",

This is easiest one of my favorite series of all time. \r\nThis review is about the two series (Honey and Clover I & II) and it's one of those stories where you get an overdrama around things, everything that could go wrong happens and enloved people never get reciprocal feelings. But at the same time there is lots of commedy, as people tend to laugh at their disgrace and others. It is not one of that shows that will bore you, it's rewatch value is very high, the plot has lots oftwists, character development is superb, it is not just  your cheap romance you're used to have ! It is that deep ! And it takes you to many situations where you can trace a parallel in your life, identify yourself with characters and/or situations , think about life itself and so on...\\n\\n\r\nSometimes you can get mad by characters decisions , but as the plot develops you'll understand/accept their decisions and by the end...you'll notice that there really wasn't any other better way to reach that result...it's just like in real life... there're no such things as fairy tales... you can't really force someone that you love, to love you, if that person loves someone else... it's hopeless no matter how hard you try, because when people love, people get blind, and it is no use for you to try to dismiss that spell. That people alone has to open its own eyes and realize the painfull truth.\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover has a priceless charm as it is more dramatic than romantic and it is full of commedy, but as i stated before, it is not boring, it keeps your attention in an interesting way full of plot twists and surprises... and the grand finale... i bet it will make you love this series forever.\\n\\n",

It kind of had a realistic touch which reflected the story rather well, which I find to be important in an anime. It also had its comical art of snooze bubbles and little souls escaping from the mouth which gave the artwork character.\r\nI can still sit here and play the song in my head whensomething funny is about to happen in the anime. It kind of makes me giggle sitting here thinking about it. Once the tune starts up, you know you're going to be laughing in the matter of seconds\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty well rounded. There were many characters to relate to, a workaholic, crazy characters, characters graduating from college, even characters struggling to find their identity. Because of these characters I have been able to say I'm not alone, true, they aren't real, but things could always be worse and some times I take their thoughts and approaches on life and work off of that. So this series is very easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very enjoyable anime, VERY funny when Morita-senpai is in the picture. Very realistic in the way people think and strive to make it in this world.",

            "content": "With this being my first review, so please go easy on me, and this will be covering both season one and two of Honey and Clover. Being a college student, it\u2019s a nice change of pace watching an anime about college kids as opposed to the usual, yet enjoyable, high school stories. At some point everyone will reach the point where they sit down and ask themselves, \u201cJust what do I want to do with my life.\u201d Honey and Clover follows the life of 6 college students and 1 university professor. This anime deals with a lot of realistic issues such as graduation, finding ajob, path to adulthood, integration into society, relationships, and money.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the story; the story can be a little slow at time but it\u2019s all about character development. As stated before it deals with more of realism as opposed to happy anime fun time, not that that\u2019s a bad thing. The story of college students dealing with graduation, making friends for life, dealing with their families, venturing off into the world of adulthood, and the ongoing shenanigans of a genius pretty much sums up what to expect from the story. I can\u2019t really type much else without giving major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters; I can go on and on about the characters but I\u2019ll try to keep it brief. If there is one thing everyone can agree on is that, but first and foremost MORITA is currently one of my favorite characters ever. All of the characters complement each other well and help in the development of the story. My current rating for characters is an 8; it would be a 10 except for the fact that there is one little girl whom I completely detested. A certain 7 year old looking college student was the only character who didn\u2019t make any progress in developing as a human being. Granted her presence contributed to the story, but as a character herself she showed little to no development. She is an 18 year old in a 7 year old body with the mind of a shy 5 year old. I can tolerate a loli here and there, but Hagu is just too much. Everyone else really evolved over the course of the story, and Morita-san was hilarious, loveable, and just plain awesome. I wish I could meet some like Morita san in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this anime was so so, but I will say this, the background was really well done and the character design was above average. The sound can get a little annoying at times since they have a lot of scenes where the characters just walk around doing something while some sad Japanese song plays in the background. Actually if memory serves it happens in almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Honey and Clover was a very enjoyable anime, and it really made me think about my future. At one point or another we all are going to have to make the decisions these fine young men and woman and hagu half to make regarding our futures. Hopefully for us it won\u2019t have to deal with most of the drama though.\\n\\n\r\nEnding thoughts:  Morita-san = awesome, Hagu = horrible character, and real world = sucks\\n\\n\r\nMEEP\\n",

I didn't really care for the opening song, but the ending songs by Suneohair... I loved.

Many of those who saw it, might think that it lacks plot twist or tension.At first I rated Hachimistu 8. The reason why I changed it to 10/10 is: \r\nThis anime is real. It differs from many others, because it does not feel fake.Its about real world, feeling are real, characters lives are real.\r\nAfter watching Honey to Clover I watched other mainstreamseries and everything looked so fake and surreal. So I realised that I had to change the rating.\\n\\n\r\n The adults in this anime controversially are a little bit childish(while in all series usually teens have the mind of 25 years old) at first it might put you off, but later you will realise, that many of us adults still behave like silly kids.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Readers beware:Excessive use of mature language.If you are allergic to different opinions to yours then sod off or i'm bringing out the hammer.\r\nWith that outta the way let's see what's what.If you have eyes,which i pressume you have since you're here,the synopsis is somewhere here on MAL so i won't bother with that at all.I've wasted enough of my time watching the damn anime,i refuse to waste some more.\r\nAnd we begin,rather confusingly,with the opening song.That's the first thing that hits your screen after all so let's go with that.It's rubbish.Plain and simple rubbish.This is the opening of an anime and what they show you issome food either dancing or humping or whateva..I've seen many shit in my life but this trumps it all easily.As for the song being used?That's like listening to the mumblings of a child who got hold of a bottle of scotch and drank it all in one sitting and then telling you all about it's kindergarden adventures and how nobody loves him/her and is all alone and life is terrible and my ice cream melted and SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY..Dear mf lord!\\n\\n\r\nAnd when you go past the first boss that is the opening song you are presented with one of the most ridiculous and horrific animations ever.If we were talking about DMC or even Ebichu it would be ok.That's supposed to be a somewhat serious down to earth anime and it looks like a fucking joke.It's not DMC bad but for a 2005 anime this looks like a washed out corpse.And don't think that as eps go by the animation gets any better cause it doesn't.In fact there are times where the animation is falling down a cliff.But hey this is heartwarming so the animation doesn't nee............Wait...What?What did you say?The animation what?Again if it's something like DMC made for fun then yes.If you're going for an anime that is all about a deep story then the animation HAS to be top notch.Did you ever go to a fancy restaurant and they served you a dish that looks like someone's ear infection?I guess not unless you count food from a canteen top of the pops.I can understand low budget issues but the only time it looked good was when you were shown stills but the motion itself is rigid and limited.\\n\\n\r\nAnd onto the story.It\u2019s about a group of college students,mostly in arts,and how they deal with romance,friendship and misfortune.On paper this sounds interesting..But it so isn't!\\n\\n\r\nFirst off the way you present the story or stories in this case is the A and the \u03a9.Cause on paper things sound ok but on screen not so much.It tries to tell many stories at once and fails miserably,much like Greece's economy.The end result is that this feels like 2 animes botched together in a hurry by someone who doesn't like anime or botching that much.The stories or these 2 animes don't fit,they don't match and they certainly don't have any effect whatsoever to each other.Let me give you a perfect example of what i'm on about.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta lives the simple life of an art student,struggling to make ends meet all the while dealing with his weird as fuck roommate,Shinobu..But then out of the blue comes a surprise in his life when his art teacher brings his cousin\u2019s daughter and talented young woman named Hagumi to class.....What?Sorry i got that wrong..It's not that,it's the story of Ayumi a pottery student who has the hots for a man who stalks a widow......What the fuck is wrong with me today..This is about Shinobu and his brother getting back their father\u2019s company..Basically what happened here was that many people gathered with ideas and because they were bored and wanted to be done with it they threw the whole lot in the pot and made a green potato mush garnished with sausages and crepes...And if my description doesn't sound much,you should watch it and see for yerselves what a big mess they made of the storytelling.I cannot put it into words just how bad it is.But i'll give it a go nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go for them characters now and dive deep into the sea of misery that is this cast.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Hagu,an 8-year-old girl who is actually 18 as we're told.Now i should stress that not only she looks like a child,but the thing is that she also acts like a child with plus the social issues of a grown up and the social insecurity.It would have been so much better and would make so much more sense if they had just said she was a child,except for the minor detail that one of the protagonists,Takemoto,is in love with her and that would spoil the story they already had.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Takemoto,he has to be the most boring character in the anime.Apart from the said romance with the 8yr old he has nothing going for him.He feels like an extra in his own freaking story.Let me run this past you.Someone who goes to school and graduates IS NOT a story.It's betime story at best.Someone who fails because of his unwillingness but somehow gets his shit together and then graduates to become something is a story..And an interesting one at that.There's no character growth to be found here.Yuuta\u2019s story is your basic trip to graduation promised land.And even his supposed feelings for the midget don't make it better,cause Hagu is by no means an interesting character.And as for their \"relationship\"?That makes no blind bit of difference cause....Spoilers so i won't get into that.Let's say it ends up with some huge hints of pedophilia..Some like this sort of stuff you know.That's why some people thought it was cute and life changing and down to earth...Pedophilia..Makes for some interesting anime.This should be the slogan for most of the reviews actually.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ayumi and her love conquests which include half the men in Japan.That is to hide here love for the man who is friendzoned by a widow.But her story is the most interesting one in the whole anime weirdly but it falls flat because they make such a heavy use of melodrama it ends up being reduced to a ridiculous story of i can't get past my crush i shall ruin my life and commit suicide.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are poorly developed.This is just a story of emotionally immature people made for emotionally immature people who can't handle life and always cry and moan about how life is unfair and cruel cause their love interest doesn't give a single fuck...\u039fh boohoo..Romantic comedy my hairy ass.Yes it does have some hilarity spread here and there,but it only serves as a shortcut to depression and suicidal avenue crossing the lovesickjunkies street.I've never seen such an example of people going out of their way to stay depressed.Unless we're talking about kids,but even kids grow out of it and go on.This lot doesn't do moving on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not just the characters.It's the way we're told about the story of these characters.It's also the use of music.Music if used right can convey and enhance the emotion in a scene or a dialogue.It's not something you use in massive doses otherwise you end up on the wrong side of the track.And that's the case here.Almost every dialogue or monologue is accompanied by sentimental music.This makes the scenes overdramatic when they don't need to be.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the way the story is fed to us the viewers.Here we stumble upon the biggest issue of all.If you happen to read any review you'll find that everyone says the same thing like a broken cassete player.That the greatest qualities are found in the form of inner monologues that tell us everything about what a character is thinking and feeling.Yeah...If used correctly again yes..But notice now the key to this sentence...TELLING.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are telling us how they feel,not showing us.Now picture this in your head.If you take the sound down all the way to 0 in the monologues,would the characters convey the same feelings?Would it show in their expressions how they feel that given moment?The answer to that is no.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is called lazy writing.It completely renders any scene devoid of meaning.In other words it's how powerful visually and intense a scene can be even if there is no dialogue at all.Anyone can draw a scene by telling us about the scene.But showing us?That's the shit right there.\\n\\n\r\nNow i won't reccomend it to anyone.But if you want to watch it and draw your own conclusions that's fine by me.",

At the time, I was in the last semester of my graduate school and the uncertainty of the future that Takemoto was going through towards the end really spoke to me. \r\nSome issues: the comedic segues were at times rocky and the men chasing after an adolescent-looking girl is a little troubling.\r\nHowever, the series is at it's strongest when it focuses on the internal life of Takemoto, the earthy protagonist we can relate to in contrast to Hagu's ethereal nature.\r\nThe metaphor of the bicycle turning and (SPOILER ALERT AHEAD) the ending scene with Takemoto professing his love to Hagu is justbeautiful.\\n\\n\r\nHe expresses his love from a place of such strength. Having just completed his spiritual journey (bike riding to the top of Japan), he knows himself better and knows that regardless of the outcome, he has worth and he has to express his love for Hagu. This is an incredibly mature character study. When he says I love you and she says thank you, it leaves me breathless. If the show ended here, it would still be a great ending. However, I REALLY LIKE part two.\\n\\n\r\n(See my review for Honey and Clover II after you've finished).",

It does not have a fancy story or overly complex characters, but still, it charms you in a way I cant properly explain. \r\nThe story basically revolves around the typical love polygon we usually see in those types of anime, its characters not deeply developed and their background remaining mysterious until the end. Pretty plain, uh? No. The development of the story, the relations between its characters and the narrations, oh the narrations, almost all the times poetical, all of these factors contributing to an impressive experience watching ananime that had not caught my attention until reading some reviews. This anime is about youth, about college, about doubts on the future in a moment of our lives when we are usually lost and thinking about what are we going to do with our lives: our adolescence. I would definitely recommend this to anyone between the ages of 17 to 25, the story will surely touch your heart in an interesting way. This is a must!",

            "content": "...yourself... unable to leave everything behind...\r\nStory (9.5): This anime is one of a few that have a great equilibrium between lighthearted laughs and a very deep and thuoghtful atmosphere. It's not just a drama, but a real approach to life, to it's questions, it's fear, it's pains and confusions. From the youth uncertainities of your own path and reasons to be, to the deeper ghosts of life like, attachments and fears that keep you from walking, learning the true meaning of love and facing an imperfect world. The only reason I didn't give it a 10, I'll admit is personal; at some point only oneof the character's story took too much importance, leaving me wanting to have more from the others.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): The art is very original and different from the stereotype, which is nice, althought, in the attempt to make Hagu extremely \"kawai\", she looked to me a bit Candy Candyish..., considering their good humor, I wouldn't doubt that's what they were trying to achieve. I specially loved how well the facial expressions conveyed each character's temperament and emotions.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10): Ahh, it's been a while since i've enjoyed an ending so much, both endings have just the perfect lyrics and feeling. And, hear this, you get to have an amazing plus because there are many episodes that include well thought songs to go with important moments, it reminded me of Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora's style. I actually looked up for the OST, sad enough, the OST doesn't include all this songs D: (random comment, I know).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): What I enjoy the most about slice-of-life, is the way characters really tend to be from flesh and bones, and H&C really achieved this well, we not only have a nice variety of characters, but each one of them has a very unique personality and ghost to deal with, you really get to feel empathy, at least with one of them. Even Morita-san, that could have simply be the random guy in other animes, was perfectly well executed, as the socially awkward loner, that loves deeply, but deals with the world in the most quirk of ways, I'll admit, I was just waiting to finish this anime to add him to my favorite characters list, there should be more free spirits in anime like him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): If it took me a while to finish it, it was only because I restrained myself to watch it all at once, because I didn't wanted it to end. So, this is one of those stories that you'll laugh, cry, get angry and happy with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): If you like to think about life itself, this anime is for you, if you like a nice slice-of-life, or enjoy to have a mixture between drama and comedy/randomness, you really should check it out, this anime really leaves you thinking after each episode is done and perhaps, lets you experience that fuzzy warm feeling inside, when you discover something new or that perhaps, you had fogotten. If you're looking simply to sit back and relax though, well, H&C might not be the right anime for that mood, as it gets pretty tense and serious at some episodes.",

            "content": "This review is for the both shows. \r\nHachimitsu to Clover or Honey and Clover is at least for me, the anime that gets closest to the reality. Literally there will be here one character that you will identify with .. personally i think i'm like the main character of this show .. and this is why this show can be so interesting. \r\nI mean .. in the normal romance we see the main characters getting in love and everything seems so easy, so unreal .. that doesn\u00b4t make them bad, but you know .. it does not fit with the reality. \r\nThis show in theother hand, represents pretty well those things. The action feels real, everything runs so natural, so smooth and at the same time it is inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nBUT... there is a huge fucking problem ... it's boring as hell. Yeah .. i took 2 weeks to watch 36 episodes.. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. It is just a slice life, but as i said, it looks so natural that i can\u00b4t give less than 8/10. The pace is kinda slow, since the evolution of the characters takes a while even though the actual time in the anime moves pretty fast, the entire action if i'm not in mistake takes 4 years, instead of the classical 1 year. But this is a josei, so it's more like a comedy/romance for adults. I felt while i was watching this show, that some of the themes talked about there were just to complicated for me, because i'm just 17 years old and i didn\u00b4t even started my life yet, so if you are in the same position, get ready because some parts may be confusing(i mean we can\u00b4t understand well what is going on, or i'm just dumb..) I believe, for those who seek mature themes, this is the ONE ! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. WHAT A PAIN ! The characters look extremely bad... like really bad. Usually i always find a character that draws my attention.. like Akame in Akame Ga Kill .. here i did not find such thing. The characters look rough and their own design for me, it\u00b4s not well made. I've seen a lot better from older animes. So there is no excuse. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the background saves the day, it is not detailed, but when it comes to represent the feelings of the characters, or to make a nice mood, does it extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. The openings are okay. What really calls my attention is the musics that they use in the episodes .. yes musics not OST(OST for who doesn\u00b4t know, is the music to fill the silence..) here we actually have like endings in the middle of the shows .. some of them are brilliant, makes the end of the scene much more better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. One thing my friends .. DEPTH .. like the depth of the ocean , it goes even further. I mean, there are 5 main characters here. Each one gets a nice development, and we get to know everything about them. Usually i only see this kind of thing in 2 characters at top.. here there are 5. But the payment is extremely high, i will explain later on. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the characters, like i said at the beginning, i almost grant you that you will find one character that fits with your personality.. all of them are great characters and it's nice seeing their \"evolution\" throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe supportive characters also get a nice development.. the one that works with our main character at his job? Well she gets development .. technically, everyone that gets with one of our main characters has some kind of development... really impressive seeing how far this anime goes in terms of development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. The first season is really slow because of the development. I mean the development is good but at the same time it makes the anime really boring at some times.. the rest is nice. The romance is good, it sounds natural you know .. and that is really a important thing. The drama is also great so as the inspiring lessons about life that this anime gives to us. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : For the first season: 6.5/10. For the second season : 8/10. For who likes romances, give this one a try. For who likes romances, but only those cute romances like toradora or so .. well this one is not the right for you. I would say that while toradora is too childish, this one is too mature so it may not be of your satisfaction.",

            "content": "-Story: 9\r\n  Well, this anime is about the life of a group of young people who all have a passion for Art and try not only to win the heart of the people they love but also to \"find\" themselves. Very realistic and meaningful, I have to say, because they cannot get what they want although they've tried really hard, which I think is right in our life, but still, they don't give up and learn even more about love and life. Life is not always pink,  we all have to face a lot of difficult challenges and sometimes we have to giveup our love and farewell is inevitable, which makes me kinda sad, after all. (Some sayings are extremely beautiful <3 <3)\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 10\\n\r\n  Even though the way that the artists draw their characters can't be called exquisite or flawless down to the smallest detail, it works perfectly in this kind of anime. I'm totally love the background, from the cherry blossom is falling or the moment the Takemoto is in love with Hagu at first sight, everything is amazing and wonderful (I'm not lying). I think since the plot is simple (not wars, no robot, no magic,...), the colors they use, therefore, is, too.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10\\n\r\n  To be honest, most of the songs in this series are in my MP3. The soundtrack suits well. Every song seems quite classic ( no rock n roll, guys ) and the lyrics are totally full of meaning and match with the situations. Some of them have no lyrics, which to me is even more beautiful, make me get emotional very fast. The director really knows how to make us cry. Thanks a lot!\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 10 (wow, this is going to take a lot of time and there will be spoilers T_T, I'm sorry)\\n\\n\r\n  First is Takemoto (my favorite one). He is a freshmen (as I remember) and according to me. he is the most normal person in this anime. He's in love with Hagu at first sight (I've already mentioned that :) ) and though he knows that Hagu doesn't feel the same way, he still loves and tries his best to help her whenever he can. His childhood doesn't have as many beautiful memories as other when his dad died and later he've had a stepfather but still he doesn't give a grudge to him because he knows that this guy truly loves his mom ( Therefore I think he's mature and realistic). Takemoto cares for every one and he's also a brave man when going on  a journey to find himself, alone.\\n\\n\r\n  Next is Hagu. Even though she studies at university but she looks like a primary student. She's small, has long blond hair, big and gorgeous eyes and a very innocent mind. She's a far relative of Shuuji but the two have got along very well since Hagu was just a secondary student so they're like father and daughter :). Hagu has a big big big passion for painting and sculpture and in her mind, it seems to be the only thing that keeps her living, of course her works can be called \" Masterpiece\". She's warm-hearted and shy in the beginning but gradually when she's used to the people in the city, we can also see that Hagu is easy to cry and sometimes acts very childish ( when she see Yamada's body). She's in love with Morita (when she saw his work, I guess) and doesn't realize it and in the end, this chibi girl surprises us somehow...\\n\\n\r\n  Moritaaaaaa. He's definitely the craziest of all the characters. He's talented, for sure, but never serious about his studies so he's studied at university for nearly 8 years and makes a record about this (su-ge-na). He's very \"naughty\" and always find ways to tease his friend or sometimes gives his senseis a heart attack. He's good at making money and smart. His brother gives a grudge to someone because this guy harmed their father but Morita seems not to really care about that and forgives him somehow (as I remember). He's like such a crazy man but he understands his friends' feeling and is willing to give them a hand or some advice. so we can see he's a good guy, after all. Oh way and yeah, he falls for Hagu, by the way.\\n\\n\r\n  Yamada is the next person. She's the daughter of a wine shop owner. She's good at making pottery and usually praised by old-senseis. She can fight, too (I meaning kicking, punching,... I just can't find the word, sorry) and this girl is absolutely a beautiful girl. She really really loves Mayama but she's scared to show her feeling and a lot time, we see her crying because she knows that Mayama loves someone else ( kinda strong in the outside but weak in the inside)\\n\\n\r\n  Finally is Mayama. This young man is a good man too. He cares for everyone, hard-working, blah blah blah, and acts... quite mature, I guess. He puts love in the first place and always devotes himself for \"her\". He knows how Yamada feels about him and tries to reject her (because he doesn't want to hurt her) but I can't remember if he does this or not.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\n  Watching these guys living their lives simply brings me joy and sadness, I truly put myself in this anime. And for those whose favorite kind of anime is slice of life, you've got to watch this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is one more thing: I'm still an Enlish learner so of course there're mistakes somewhere about grammar and this review may not give you what you want to know and it's not good, for sure. BUT anyway, THANKS FOR READING :))))))\\n",

            "content": "Was it ever supposed to get this good? Honey and Clover began life as the debut series for Fuji TV's \"Noitamina\" (read it backwards) lineup, a new anime block aimed at older female audiences. The simple but daring plan worked\u2014young women who would never normally watch anime got into it, and the manga now breaks the Top 10 sales list regularly, sitting alongside blockbuster titles like Prince of Tennis or Bleach. But even viewers outside the target demographic attest to its greatness, pointing out its heartfelt storytelling and unique visual style. It was supposed to be just good enough for sophisticated female viewers\u2014and it endedup being good enough for everyone. Funnier than most comedies and more touching than most dramas (even the live-action ones), Honey and Clover has emerged as one of the best shows of 2005.\\n\\n\r\nLike a true slice-of-life series, it begins right in the middle of things\u2014Takemoto in his second year of college, Mayama nearing graduation, and Morita stuck in seventh-year hell. When Hagu-chan shows up, there's hardly any \"please welcome the new student\" pomp; she simply joins the cast, and the drama-go-round begins. There is no epic quest to fulfill, no convoluted conspiracy to unlock, no childhood friend to win over\u2014it's just a bunch of college kids figuring out what to do with their lives, and it is fascinating. Every character gets a moment in the spotlight, with story arcs transiting flawlessly between each other. Even Takemoto, who spends most of the series as a neutral observer, closes things out with an inspiring personal triumph. The mood of the show switches effortlessly from madcap comedy to utter heartbreak and everything in between, yet nothing feels out of place. Within a single episode, a game of Art School Twister takes humor to new heights, and yet minutes later, Takemoto muses upon the meaning of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nLike all good shoujo, Honey and Clover succeeds because of its characters' complex personalities. Morita emerges as a quick fan favorite with his bizarre antics and affinity for money, but to focus on him is to miss out on the intricate relationships between everyone else. In particular, Ayumi's unrequited attachment to Mayama is sure to arouse plenty of indignation about the portrayal of women in Japanese entertainment. But maybe that anger is because Ayumi openly reveals everything we hate about themselves: weakness, insecurity, and the tendency to do really stupid things in the name of love. She is the most human character in a cast of incredibly human characters.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this realism on the emotional level, however, the artwork in the show is decidedly surreal and dreamlike. The character designs match the manga almost perfectly with big, expressive eyes, ultrathin lines, and characteristic hatch marks. Even the coloring style adheres to the comic; you may never again see an anime that looks like it was watercolored (there are a few exceptions, like SaiKano). The animation is equally adept, with moments of broad physical comedy being rendered just as smoothly as subtle scenes of close-up dialogue. And of course, no discussion of Honey and Clover is complete without the infamous \"food\" opening, where spinning plates of food behave in very un-foodlike ways. This 90-second homage to stop-motion auteur Jan Svankmajer is just the first of many artistic touches, proving that the animators\u2014like the art students depicted in the series\u2014treasure creativity above all else.\\n\\n\r\nIf music is the language of emotion, then few shows speak it as eloquently as this one. With just a few studio instruments, the soundtrack is able to express the gamut of emotions that each character runs through. The energetic opening theme by YUKI converts into a gentle piano solo, and even Morita's bouts of insanity are accented by charming comedic themes. The most effective emotional tools, however, are the insert songs by singer-songwriter Suga Shikao and rock group SPITZ. Playing a poignant song over internal monologue is hardly a new thing, especially in angsty teen dramas, but to hear it used in an anime makes the technique fresh once more.\\n\\n\r\nIf Honey and Clover has any faults, it's that you want it to keep going after it's over. It ends just like it begins\u2014right in the middle of things, with so much more yet to be experienced. Without realizing it, you've become part of that circle of friends: you've shared their heartbreaks and triumphs, walked alongside them as they poured out their feelings, and watched each one of them learn a little bit more about themselves. Whether in school or not, who hasn't asked themselves at some point: \"What do I want to do? Who do I want to be?\" Honey and Clover may not have the answers, but it's all about trying to find them.",

            "content": "I can easily tell you that Honey and Clover is and will remain my most favorite anime of all time. \r\nStory\r\nHoney and Clover's story is so simple. It's a story about some friends who are attending the same art college....and pretty much what they go through in their everyday college student lives. At first glance, oh it's bland. Where's the action? Where's the crazy plot twists? Where's the fan service?? Where's the blatant mushy romance?!?!?\r\n*cough* I see why this anime is a tad underrated.*cough*\r\nThis anime is SUBTLE,  SO subtle, in its storytelling. It doesn't lay everything out for you in plain writing. It unfoldsgradually, maturing slowly. It gives you hints--glimpses, snippets, of a character's true feelings, strivings, yearnings-- a glimmer of what's really there underneath the plots' seemingly simplistic surface. The development of the story is pretty unique as well. This story is essentially about love. Painful love. Giddy love. Unrequited love. Life changing love. But mostly about the care and devotion that we feel towards our friends. And so the plot isn't developed with unexpected happenings or crazy tragedy or predictable romance. It's developed as the relationships between the characters develop. Which is incredible.What I LOVE about the story is that it isn't plastered with those cheap devices one finds in a lot of anime to keep the viewers' attention (fanservice, cutesy romance, melodrama, fast plot with zillions of littles arcs).\\n\r\n It is SO honest with the story it's trying to tell. So genuine. So straight forward yet deeply moving and suggestive of things so much bigger than what it shows you. In the end, you're left breathless.\\n\r\n It's just...so beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art matches the tone and style of this series PERFECTLY. It's muted and pastelly and soft and seems to glow a bit. It might seem boring to some. It isn't jam-packed with CGI and bold colors and crisp backgrounds. But it's beautiful all the same. I loved the unique sugary softness of the character designs especially.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music for this series was another home run. Like the art (and everything else) it fit the series perfectly. I also really liked the opening and ending songs :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters of Honey and Clover are what make this anime a masterpiece. Like any story, character development is key. What I liked so much about this anime was how realistic the characters were. The emotions they feel and they way they react to the situations they go through were just so believable. I could relate to so much of it. And as the anime progresses and you get to see more and more of who these characters are, you grow to understand the way they feel and why they act they way they do....you get to see what makes them tick is a way. Watching the characters of this series grow and develop and mature and relate to one another, the connections they build, and the love that they share, is an incredible experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\r\nHoney and Clover, to me, is an incredible anime because it's unique, the character development is... incredible, it's very touching and heart warming...but mostly because it's so sincere with the story it's trying to tell. It sticks to the integrity of the storytelling and its central themes of love and friendship in a way that's so genuine and lovely and passionate...I don't see how it couldn't be my favorite anime.",

Kind of a love drama with some comedy, but instead of focussing on the love and relationships, it explores human thoughts and behaviour that stands in the way of those things. And I like that twist on this classic thteme.\r\nThis anime makes you reflect about your own life, which it an impressive feat. But the story itself is fractured and pretty hard to keep track of. It probably should have been compressed into 13 episodes. There is not THAT much going on.\r\nCute, funny and philosophical on a first-person level. Not bad at all.\r\nThe OVA's episode 25 and 26 (\"F\"& \"L\") are just four irrelevant comedy scetches, and not really worth watching if you have a life.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\t\\n\r\nLooking pretty neat. Great character design yadda yadda. I think I have said this about like 90% of the animes I've watched. But still, neat.\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are not my cup of tea, and the background music is very, veery repetetive. The voice acting is good, though, but as usual in anime there is one voice you just can't stand (Hagu in this case).\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nThere are several storylines going on at the same time, and it gets hard to keep track of them all. Often it just feels very fractured, when the directors try to jam as much stuff into each episode as possible. But still the story moves at a very slow pace. And do we get closure? Not really. It all moves on in the 2nd season though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nThe main cast is a diverse lot, and most are involved in at least one love triangle and a couple of other plotlines. Not many of these get very evolved, and I guess you could say character development on a linear time scale is pretty nonexistant. But you still get to know most of the cast pretty deep somehow. And they are all brilliant!",

            "content": "Based on both seasons of H&C\r\nThis anime is definitely NOT for everyone. I was drawn to this anime simply because of the overwhelming craze/awards/hype it was getting. A friend told me this anime had a girl in it that went beyond the Lolita look and was fancied by the male characters in the series and even though they where all 18+ of age it made him (and me at times) feel awkward.\r\nAt the end of the day I (unfortunately) have to agree with the majourity and say this is a very good anime show overall.\r\nAnimation \r\nAnimation was decent, character animation was different than casual animewith face shapes and stuff but the scenery was drawn beautifully, one of the major strong points of this anime. Ending scene was nice as well especially in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nAnother shining point for the anime, Opening for 1st season was a bit Up-tempo but nice. Character voices were perfect, everyone seemed to fit well even if it was annoying at times (Hagu). Generally the sound just fit very well with the flow of things.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis is the difficult part. I said earlier this anime isn\u2019t for everyone that\u2019s because with these \u201cReal Life\u201d type stories it comes down to what part of real life us the viewers want to see. Now this is definitely a drama/romance anime but I personally wouldn\u2019t class this as girly because it wasn\u2019t girly at all. Yes I will say there is a soap-opera feel which can annoy at times but it is balanced out quite well never going too \u201csunset beach\u201d if you will. Every character had their own personal issues as well as love problems which mixed well with their college life, work and ambitions. The most surprising part of this story is that it is spanned over a number of years so you see just how fast or slow life can change around you. In retrospect looking at this as a story it is well written and very realistic but some people might find this slow paced and eventless\u2026.well sometimes life can seem that way I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are excellent. When I first watched this anime I was really pessimistic in thinking all these other reviewers where just being too nice or something. By the time I got half way through season one I noticed that the characters where quite mature and interesting. I felt a \u201cSchool Rumble\u201d type vibe from some of the characters especially Morita. These characters make the story what it is and I must say while some might annoy you with their problems (Ayumi) others will gain your respect (Takemoto).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nUhm I felt a higher sense of intrigue then enjoyment foe this title.\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime to a point and im glad I watched it overall as it reminded me of the main reason I love anime, which is to enjoy a great story that will get me thinking. So i guess I can understand now why this got such high praise.\\n\\n\r\nValue \\n\\n\r\nValue is probably the lowest point. Although this anime is a great story in itself I do admit I found it hard to watch most of the time. Maybe it\u2019s because after a certain point I was more focused on some characters rather than others or maybe at times the love issues annoyed me. Either way, now I\u2019ve watched it I can say it was a good story overall about people and the lives and choices they made but watching it again would definitely not happen.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way it just like real life once its gone there\u2019s no going back.\\n\\n\r\nPlanet Tyro Rating: First Class\\n\\n\r\nPlanettyro.com",

Overall, the storyline is very detailed and includes many emotional scenes . It's extremely different from your typical moe anime with a fairy tale ending . It's realistic ; it shows the effects of actual human relationships that don't end the way we all hope . I ended up dropping the series because it didn't go how I wanted it to , and the protagonist(s) sometimes annoyed me . However it is a perfect fit for those who love to ponder andgo beyond the norm .

Well this anime, at least to me, was that scenery, that song, and that smell. \r\nI watched this anime when I was in Uni back in 2009. At that time I didn't think too much of it, just another slice of life anime. But something compelled me to watch it again and boy am I glad I did. After a few jobs and that one relationship this show reallyfeels completely different. I can really see the suitableness and nuance of being a young adult. You know, the time in your life when you come to a grinding stop after years of school because you always \"knew\" that you had to get a good education or years of living someone else's dreams and ambitions, what commonly is known as a quarter life crisis. This show, simultaneously makes you rethink the choices you have made in life and gives you hope for the future. Because no one is  perfect and you don't always get what you want or what you think is fair in life. Maybe I am reading to much into the story or I am forcing my own experience on the narrative. Whatever it is, this show reminded me that you have to continue with life and enjoy everything that it throws at you. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme 'Waltz' will always have a place in my heart as the song that reminds me of this beautiful anime and that not all mistakes are bad.\\n\\n",

And a big part of the show is how others deal with their attraction towards her, and how she deals with her own romantic feelings.\r\nIt's just asking me to believe too much.

This isn't an anime about romance/drama, is mostly about life and growing up. A coming of age story if you will.\\n\\n\r\nFor individual aspects:\\n\\n\r\nStory 10: Simple but deep, the story altough has a pretty basic formula gets complex when you analyze each and every character and the relationships with each other, allowing you to be surprised. This is where Honey and Clover shines.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great, clean animation and beautiful sceneries. Has a dream-like feel to it, as well as breath-taking when it comes to country-side Japan.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The insert songs by Spitz, Suneohair, and the Opening by Yuki bring out the emotion from scenes and moments, turning them into heartwrenching moments that will be burned into your head. The music in H&C is down-right amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Another strong point, every character has it's own personality and doesn't fall to clich\u00e9s. At the start one may classify some characters, but as the series progress so the characters. There isn't one unlovable character in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: From smart and laugh out funny moments, to gut-wrenching drama, to heart warming love this series has it all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 The only reason I don't give this anime a 10 is because of the pace. The anime has a good pace but sometimes it's broken with some slice-of-life episodes that make the pacing go awkward for a bit.",

The animation was kind of different, and I was not used to such a setting. The characters were not introduced in the usual manner. It felt random. But after watching a few episodes, it started getting interesting. If you are a slice of life lover, this one is a must.\r\nThe anime was quite mature in handling relationships. After watching a hundred romance anime in school setting, it was definitely worth watching and gave me a good change.\r\nThe humorwas pretty good. I never expected to have a good laugh in between quite serious scenes. There were sad moments, moments which made you think about your own life, moments when you would try to understand love and a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nAs in the description, even though you may not be poor, any college student living on his/her own has a lot to relate to. The confusion about what to do in life, friends, love, talent, work are portrayed beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hachimitsu to Clover is anime worth watching and enjoyable. I went through both the seasons in a single go, though I was hesitant in the beginning. So, give it a try and you will love it.  \\n\\n",

Just like how Fist of North Star have over-the-top violent, \"slice of life\" tend to suffer from over-the-top peace and happiness. \r\nHachimitsu to Clover have none of those problem. The characters in the show faced a lot of realistic problem. Young people have endless opportunity in front of them, but at the same time it bring the same amount of doubt and anxiety.\r\nThe main character (MC), being not specially talented at anything, is surrounded by a cast of super talented friend with brightfuture ahead of them. Setting the standard of \"satisfying career\" even harder for the MC. Now mix in some romance, love triangle, drama, job-hunter, and graduation closer and closer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is presented with a great dose of comedy, with beautify graphic style that resemble oil painting, a perfect match for a show that set in a art college. \\n\\n\r\nHachimitsu to Clover is one awesome bittersweet journey, something that only happened once in anyone's life time. The show doesn't have any tear-jerking moment, but I know I shed some tears at the end.",

            "content": "The Sweet aspect of Love\r\nHoney and Clover is a Romantic Dramatic Comedy were emotions run high, comedy hits hard and watchers may be reduced to tears (Including Me Many Times).\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story seems familiar at the beginning, the main character meets a girl, who looks older than she actually looks and is coincidentally amazing at art. But everything beyond that is fresh and new including every situation within the show; you\u2019ll never know what will happen next. The Romance has enough fuzzy feelings to carbonate the ocean 3 times over.  It may progress slowly and you may feel like you have it mapped outbut than it takes a completely different turn. The drama is in abundance, many main characters suffer when things don\u2019t go their way. When The Comedy does appear it is quite well \\n\r\nneeded and flat out, gut bustingly hilarious (THANK YOU MORITA-SAN!).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHoney and Clover produces some of the most memorable and lovable characters of all time. Every character progresses GREATLY within the show.\\n\\n\r\nTakemoto is a 19 year old college student living in the some house as his best friends Morita and Mayama. He is very mellow and is quite the likable dude. He soon acts as a big-brother figure to Hagumi, always being there for her and always ready to help her.\\n\\n\r\nHagumi is a cute 18 year old girl with the appearance of a small child. She is very skilled in art but is shy and very nervous when conversing with those she does not know.\\n\\n\r\nMorita is a happy go lucky 24 year old 6 time student. He is very comedic and mysterious, randomly showing up and leaving the household. 75% of all the comedy comes from Morita\u2019s insanity or crazy situations which are very swell\\n\\n\r\nMayama is the \u201cnormal\u201d one. Being nice and always helpful is this man\u2019s strong suit. He is very caring towards his friends\\n\\n\r\nAyumi is a well-known ceramic artist, making fast friends with Hagumi because of her kind nature\\n\\n\r\nMany more side characters come into play but all of them are well handled and lovable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is AMAZING; everything appears with a water color like hue, the character design is cute and all are reminiscent of the characters personality. The Openings especially is beyond beautiful, one being done with stop motion food and the other being animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is lively and captures characters perfectly. The Opening and background music is a well-made treat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt may start out slowly but gains speed. If you like to Laugh, Cry, and Wonder what the Hell is coming next; HONEY AND CLOVER is the show for you. \\n",

            "content": "This review is based off of both season 1 and season 2 of honey and clover. (I have bad grammar, but review will be spoiler free)\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is about a group of art college students who become friends and live there lives. That is the story in simple terms. The story also has some twist. For example there are a couple of love triangles, and a few other small annoying factors in the story that are not a huge deals, but they still plays a toll on the story.\r\nART:\r\nAs I am sure the majority of us are well aware, but for those who are notthe art is very well done considering the anime was only aired in 2005. Even if the art is actually considered \"bad\" in my opinion it is perfect. It matches the story to a T, and for some reason makes the story feel.as if it were on a more emotional level. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nI didn't notice the sound much throughout the anime, however when there was a scene that was supposed to be emotional or dramatic the sound was for the most part on point, and really emphasized the emotional aspect of whatever scene it was in the anime. (Dramatic scenes for the most part )\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n If ir weren't for the main fact that my favorite character was rejected by a.certain someone in the anime in the second last episode I would probably gave a higher rating, but I waited for the very moment when she would NOT reject him, but she decided to reject him even though she \"loved him\" and holy moly I wish it were different. Anyway enough with the rambling. The characted development was consistent throughout the anime, and each character had  something to overcome,  and I feel no characters was left out. I will admit some characters should have been focused on more than others, but in the end they managed to make most of the characters instady thoughts come to a stable point where they could end the anime. I realize that may not make much sense but basically the characters thoughts and feelings came to a point at the end where they could be happy simply put. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed the anime. Especially the romance aspects of it. Even though there was more drama than romance.  My favorite character was also at the very least recognized and loves my the one girl I wanted him to end up with, however they did not end up together so that made me enjoy the anime a little less. I recommend anyone who likes romance. Of drama to give it a go. Again this review is based on both seasons. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nodame Cantabile is one of the most popular shows ever. It's a manga that got turned into an anime, TV show, and movie. In my mind it's quite similar to HachiKuro, which is a manga that got turned into an anime, TV show, and movie. I'd bet NodaCan is the more popular of the two but did you know Yoko Kanno did the music for the HachiKuro movie?\r\nIn order to write this review, I watched the first two episodes just now. I last saw the entire show nearly ten years ago. @_@ All I remembered was that it was very emotional, most of the characters\u2019names, certain plot points, that it was beautiful, and that they liked to put songs into the episodes. I\u2019m waiting to find someone who might be interested in this show before I re-watch the whole thing, so this will have to suffice. Why did I decide to write a review of HachiKuro? Firstly, I promised Karlstein I would (before I got sidetracked). Secondly, I wanted to put a positive review in my reviews.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll tell you a secret. I love art. What struck me when I first saw the show was just how good it looked. It seemed less of an anime and more of a watercolor manga come to life, with its soft colors and detailed lines. Watching it today, I noticed it was more than that. The way shots are framed is also quite impressive, with varied angles and distances appropriate for the mood.\\n\\n\r\nMorita-sempai! He\u2019s awesome. One thing that bugged me about the Viz subs is that even though they put -sempai and stuff on names and have a glossary of cultural terms, some weirdo decided to always put characters\u2019 first names. Shinobu? I totally forgot he had a first name.\\n\\n\r\nHachiKuro is about art students making art, and some of the pieces they come up with are really neat. At the same time, they have to deal with growing up and relationships, hence it being very emotional. The characters act believably towards each other, although certain things are exaggerated, like when Hagu cries, her eyes become squiggles or Morita-sempai zooms around at high speed. There\u2019s a certain light mood through the show, which helps to you become attached to the characters and ratchets up the drama higher than an entirely serious show would be able to. This is a delicate balance to maintain. Too much humor can devalue the serious parts but they pull it off magnificently.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I can recall, there aren\u2019t many sword fights, giant mech races, or space ship battles, so if you\u2019re looking for action, I\u2019m afraid you may be in for some disappointment. What you have is beautiful art, and stories of friendship and love. I once showed someone \u201cWhisper of the Heart\u201d and she thought it was incredibly boring because it seemed like all very normal, everyday stuff. This is rather along those lines.\\n\\n\r\nI remember the first time I saw this show. I accidentally walked in on episode three or four and thought it looked really dumb. However, I eventually went back, started from the top, and let it draw me in. Ack, that pun was not intended.\\n\\n\r\nA few months ago, I borrowed the movie version from the library and watched a little bit. However, since they only had 116 minutes to cover (presumably) season one, everything got jumbled and they had to slot famous lines in wherever they could. Also, Hagu was too tall.",

            "content": "Honey and Clover has an extremely unique art style. Studio J.C. Staff from works like Revolutionary Girl Utena and Slayers at this point never tackled an anime of such maturity before. This show was directed by the amazing Kenichi Kasia (Major), so hope were scattered going in. Could a studio that has never really handled this kind of show before pull out a winner? Could a good director save the show and make the audience fall in love with each character?\r\nYuuta Takemoto is an art major trying to find his motivation in life, but seems to go about his daily routine in a lull. Helives a simple life and joins with: a serious guy by the name of Takumi, a dude that is like a living energy drink called Shinobu, a small petite 18 years art talent named Hagumi, and Hagumi\u2019s friend Ayu. All of these characters go through important and interesting trials in their college lives ranging from falling in love, moving on from tough times, and discovering one\u2019s self.\\n\\n\r\nTo make this show into something great it is very clear how important the direction of specific voice acting, aesthetics, following a tight script, and making it all believable simultaneously. Honey and Clover\u2019s best success comes from the characters. The chemistry between each of the main cast never over exaggerates, but instead creates an environment that the audience can relate to. Due to the fact there is not a distinct plot, these same characters must push the show through each and every episode. Never is there a trope or clich\u00e9 to detach from reality, but each person is intelligent, has their own individuality, their own emotions never to be wasted at any point or in any scene. Speaking of emotions, when there is a heart wrenching moment or fear be it longing for love or acceptance, the audience can\u2019t help but feel the same emotions as that particular character which creates real personalities. It is like we, the audience, can hear those character\u2019s screams for love they will never have returned to them. Honey and Clover is very powerful in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nLight piano music with various J-pop molds well within the drama unfolding. The music even creates a nice transition between events and scenes never feeling forced. Animation is in a pastel art which can deter some from the show along with a slower pace, but this actually helps the show. Slower movement of scenes creates active tension for the characters, and gives the audience time to slowly realize that single emotion a characters is feeling. Along with that soft piano, a sense of calmness after all of the emotional trials comes over the atmosphere that isn\u2019t really experienced in many anime. Almost everything about Honey and Clover is unique.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does a fantastic job making what could seem like a generic college romance story on the surface turn into something more with unforgettable characters going about their daily lives without being dull. Unfortunately, this leads to an ending without a real conclusion much like real life. Very few events are totally resolved, but by the end of Honey and Clover, it would be hard to not relate to at least one character.",

The characters themselves are what make this anime such a success, and Honey and Clover does an excellent job of fluidly giving each individual enough screen time to shine.  The themes and conflicts are very easy to relate to, and the story moves along in a soft, but surprisingly slippery pace-- as does life at that age.\r\nIt's touching, heartfelt, at times bittersweet, with just the right amountof comedy.  The animation style is a little bit different, but works very well considering the subject matter IMO.\\n\\n\r\nBONUS:  If you're an artist, writer, or have a creative mind, the running theme concerning struggles with inspiration and creativity in general will really hit home.  Highly recommended.",

It's hard no to see yourself in a lot of situations.\r\nHow these people get along during the challenges that appear during college days and some love triangles take the most part of the show. An odd thing is that to me the lead character (Takemoto)was rather uninteresting until the end of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also stands out in Honey & Clover. Right in the first episode there is a remarkable scene with the OST. The OP-ED are unusually good, with some references of the anime itself (as usual) and other movies/series, like Beetlejuice, which is very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recomend it to anyone, one of my favorite animes.",

However, I'm glad to have experienced Hachimitsu to Clover. I experienced all kinds of emotions while watching this anime. \r\n(Side note: I've read reviews claiming how this anime is so \"boring\" and slow paced. WHAT THE HECK DID YOU EXPECT? ACTION??? Don't come bashing this anime when you don't like watching slice of life, drama, andcomedy.This anime isn't for little kids with premature brains.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay, its different from those generic drawing/animations. \\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND REALLY MAKES THIS ANIME FANTASTIC! Oh man I love the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are incredibly lovable. I've laughed and felt depressed with them.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime and I'm sure you will too.

            "content": "This review is for both of the seasons of Honey & Clover.\r\nOverall, I think that this story is a masterpiece. I don't like \"slice-of-life\" genre AT ALL, but this story certainly captured me... even though I thought I would hate it. \r\nThe characters are not cardboard at all. They come to life, they have their own problems & in the end, it seems like there isn't just one \"main character\", but there are many. Their personal lives really suck you in. Every character develops into a new person it seems by the end of the series.\r\nThe drama is good, but it seems to take severalepisodes sometimes for one character to get over a certain problem. This was probably the only thing that bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good. Sometimes backgrounds can seem generic & overused, but other times, the animation can take your breath away.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for romance, an anime with a reality check, sadness, happiness & definitely a lot of comedy, this anime is for you & is definitely worth a shot!",

Each person has their own hidden secrets and tendencies, their own feelings. I loved the way the characters grew before my eyes throughout the series and I want to keep following their journeys after this series and the next had finished.\r\nAnother thing I found very amazing was how they realistically portrayed feelings, loveand unrequited love. In most shows these are not portrayed as realistically as you would like, and, even it is romantic, it doesn't grasp how you would feel if you were in there shoes. However, for me, Honey and Clover does an excellent job of this, I really felt like I had gone through what they were going through, and I would sit there and go, 'that is exactly how I would feel.'\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really captures you and allows you to follow and wish to be part of this story, but it also allows to not want to be part of the story and instead, just watch.\\n",

            "content": "_Honey and Clover_ was odd. I *wanted* to like it, but for some reason it just struck me as mediocre. I was going to leave it at 7, but I thought the final episodes developed Takemoto's character at least a little, and I was deeply amused by the comedy interlude episodes ('Ham-senpai!'); as well, I have a lingering fondness for the visual elegance & music of the first ED. I'd like to see where the characters go, so I'll watch season 2.",
