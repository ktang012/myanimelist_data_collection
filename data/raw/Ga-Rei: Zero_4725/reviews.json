            "content": "*Powerful opening episode plus a strong ending makes Ga-Rei Zero a definite must see for action fans.*\r\n\u201cWill you kill someone you love because of love?\u201d\r\nThose who have already seen Ga-Rei Zero (GRZ) are probably sick of reading the quote above, but it is nonetheless an effective quote to advertise for GRZ. I still remember what initially caught my interest in GRZ, it was the amazing trailer. Boy, how misleading it was \u2026 \r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Ga-Rei Zero is quite fabulous indeed. The synopsis may sound generic, but the technique used to present the story that will eventually lead into Ga-Rei (manga) is what makesthis gem a success in this recessional era. The excitement level of GRZ can be described by a simple parabolic function (think of the letter \u201cU\u201d), though the initial point stands out a lot more than the ending. This is analogous to say you drop a ball from great height and watch it fall down and slowly climb back up. But no matter how hard it tries, in the end it cannot go back to the initial height.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of GRZ is extremely well thought out and well executed to say the least. Given the length of the series it is a very enthralling little show. Demon hunting may be the first thing come to mind after reading the simple summary of the anime. But what lies beneath that outer layer is the fragile little thing known as friendship and what happens to it when that treasure betrays oneself; that is the true moral of the story. Please keep in mind that GRZ is simply the prequel to the actual story in Ga-Rei (manga) thus you may find some unsatisfactory conclusion with regards to certain people or certain things.\\n\\n\r\nGiant CG rolling dinosaurs on fire seem unnecessary but they served their purpose. The way some of the dramatic scenes were animated could have used a little more work. For instance it is possible to create a more nauseating scene by using a more unique camera angle/position rather than attempting to semi censor the scene with dull lifeless angles. On a more positive note, the animation quality is pretty consistent throughout the series and the characters themselves look great, especially when compared to the drawings in the manga. The battle animations are perhaps the most notable positive feature to the show. Fluid dynamic animation plus smooth scene to scene transitions also helped make GRZ one of the better animated shows of the season. It is evident that a lot of effort has been put into the show by the animation crew, even the backgrounds in each scene is very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nAs should be expected from an action oriented anime, the music is very outstanding. From the OP to battle BGM to ED, they all suit their theme well. The OP was nominated by fans as one of the top ten 2008 anime OP. Voicing-wise, Minori Chinhara was great playing as Kagura, and the unrecognizable voice change for the OP just makes it all the better. While there are not many superstar level seiyu (ie. award winners), it seems all characters received a suitable voice for themselves thus you will unlikely to have to clean your ears after watching each episode.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most single season anime, GRZ is not one where you should marathon through in a day. It is as if Ei Aoki (director of GRZ) just had an uncontrollable diarrhea. He literally dumps all the nasty stuff at you right from the start. You are bound to be confused after the first two episodes. Take it easy, we have all been through that stage. It will be tempting to keep on watching, but take my advice if you want to retain some sanity; stop there and think about what happened so far as things will go downhill from here.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t quite enjoy watching flying limbs or spurting blood, I suggest you stick to the TV release as they censored the \u201cugly\u201d stuff in most cases. I also don\u2019t recommend fans of Natsuki Kuga from Mai-HiME (or Natsuki Kruger in Mai Otome) to watch this as there is a certain someone here by the name of Natsuki Kasuga who also happens to be a motorbike chick with strong connection to dual wielding pistols. Though the difference here is how minor a role she plays and the cruel fate that awaits her.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I didn\u2019t enjoy about GRZ is the sudden appearance of cheesy RPG-like weapons after episode one. Bullet shooting suitcase? Metal drill knuckle? Outrageous combat wheelchair? None of that were in the trailer! And none of those were anywhere near as exciting as the hot motorbike or the dual pistols. Now that I think about it, I feel like I got trolled by the trailer. Anyway, aside from the opening episode I wouldn\u2019t call GRZ particular \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, but it is unquestionably one of the best (if not THE best) action anime for the fall season of 2008.",

            "content": "This review is technically spoiler free, but if the names, Yomi or Kagura, are unfamiliar to you, I would suggest watching the first two episodes before reading any of the reviews.\r\nAdmittedly, when I first read the show's description (which purposely reads generic), I didn't think the show was going to be that good. So when I gave it a shot, the first episode certainly drew my attention, but I expected once the shocking cliffhangers wore off it&rsquo;d be a pretty generic, demon-hunting, hero-coming-of-age shounen. \r\nMan, I was dead wrong. GRZ turned out to be biggest surprise of the fall season, and one of the bestdamn shows I&rsquo;ve seen, hands down.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters: GRZ has a simple story at its heart. The whole demon hunting setting is really just a conveniently action/guro-friendly wrapper for the real story: The making and the breakdown of a strong friendship. What makes the show so powerful is the great job the writers did in exploring and developing the relationship between Kagura and Yomi &ndash; that&rsquo;s when the show really starts to become something special. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the short 12 episode season doesn&rsquo;t allow them to provide much background on the other characters and also leaves some loose plot ends hanging (which is probably to be expected, since it&rsquo;s a prequel to the Ga-rei manga). \\n\\n\r\nBut all that&rsquo;s forgivable, because everything is really all just a foil to Kagura and Yomi in the end. The dynamic between the two drives the whole show. The comedy, the action, the drama and ultimately, the tragedy &ndash; everything &ndash; hinges on how much you come to like their characters and relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The battle scenes were well-animated and ranged from stylistic to quick and brutal, which despite the fantastic setting, made the show feel more realistic. The character designs were streamlined and attractive, with particular attention paid to Kagura and Yomi's cuteness/hotness. The monster designs were pretty generic, but they make up for it by making the mythical creatures, Ranguren and Byakuei, look appropriately fierce and majestic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The producers of GRZ took some bold sound design chances - such as forgoing the OP/ED in the initial episode - that helped to amp up the show's atmosphere. The music also stood out throughout the series, especially during the battle scenes: ranging from a rock/techno mix during the exciting, stylistic battles, to the haunting and emotional, vocal-driven arrangement during the final battle. It always seemed to hit the right chord. Voice work was very good with  special kudos due to Kaoru Mizuhara (Misao in Lucky Star) and Minori Chihara (Yuki Nagato in TMoHS), as Yomi and Kagura, doing excellent jobs in roles that I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected from them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: If you're looking for a well-written, action-oriented show (admittedly, not for the squeamish) with really strong character development, I highly recommend GRZ.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this review was helpful to you. (Positive/negative) feedback is always appreciated. Thanks!",

            "content": "Ga-Rei -Zero- is set as the prequel to Ga-Rei the manga. The manga, itself, is a supernatural action shounen so Ga-Rei -Zero- is set in the same way. While knowing the setting of the manga helps to understand the anime better, it is definitely not required to read the manga beforehand to enjoy Ga-Rei -Zero-. This viewer had never heard of Ga-Rei before the anime, yet was still able to enjoy the Ga-Rei -Zero-.\r\nFor those not familiar with the Ga-Rei setting, it is essentially about an agency that hunts rogue spirits using exorcists. A Ga-Rei is a spirit beast that exorcists use in addition toother exotic weapons and traditional swords to fight supernatural enemies.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The storytelling for Ga-Rei was nothing short of amazing. The first two episodes occur chronologically towards the end of the series, but set up a conflict during which the rest of the series tries to explain how events lead up to such a conflict. This leaves the viewer constantly guessing throughout the series, giving enjoyment through suspense. At the same time, the viewer is greeted with several humorous scenes through the show that help lighten the mood and make you enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation for Ga-Rei isn't extraordinary or anything. It gets the job done. The supernatural enemies look disgusting and allow you to develop a hatred for them. The characters are drawn in a way that you develop interest in them. The action looks fluid and is pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: What really stood out to me in Ga-Rei was the sound. The background music really fit the mood well and after every episode, it left me questioning when the OST would come out. Furthermore, the Ga-Rei anime comes out with an amazing image and insert song CD, many of the songs which are used in fitting moments throughout Ga-Rei. Both the OP and ED fit the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ga-Rei really focuses on developing the two main characters, Kagura and Yomi. While I feel that the other characters weren't developed as much as I would have liked, the story is really focused on Kagura and Yomi and only their development is crucial to the story. The way Kagura and Yomi interact together and towards other characters seems appropriate for their age and their past experiences and because of their interaction with each other, they change and part of the story is watching their growth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The combination of a great storyline as well as well-done action sequences put to an outstanding soundtrack makes this anime incredibly enjoyable for me. Once you start the anime, at least for the first couple of episodes, it's almost impossible to stop. The first few episodes demand the viewer to watch them one after another. Combined with the humorous yuri moments and other cute moments, Ga-Rei does its best to tell a story that can both standalone, but at the same time, persuade the viewer to continue the series into the manga.",

            "content": "~Note~\r\n- This will be my first anime review.\r\n- Might contain spoilers.\r\nGa-Rei: Zero, is one of those anime that blew my expectations away; truly an anime I wished I discovered sooner. This anime is so underrated, I hope this review does some good. \r\n\"Will you kill someone you love, because of love?\"\r\nThat quote was what got me interested, and I watched to find the answer.\r\n-Story:  Basically two girls, Yomi and Kagura, that has experienced deaths of loved ones by demons. They both belong to families that are destined to be exorcists. They do their best to live up to their family names. One day theymet and began to live together as \"sisters\". They then go and hunt and exorcise demons, which no ordinary human can see, under an agency that specializes in fighting demons. \\n\\n\r\n-Art:  I thought the animations were good for an anime that aired in 2008. Byakuei and Ranguren looked awesome. The fighting scenes are well executed. I also really enjoyed the final fight scene.  I have to say that the first episode's animation could of been more appealing.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound:  I don't pay attention to the sound effects as much, but I said they were good. I really liked the opening song, probably one of the few I don't skip. \\n\\n\r\n-Character: I say this is one of the good aspect of Ga-Rei: Zero. Within the flashbacks, you really get the chance to know more about Yomi and Kagura. You get to find out what their families expect from them, what they been through, and you get to see the change from when they first met to the last scene. Yomi and Kagura were well developed, but supporting characters were not as much. Maybe due to the fact that a bunch of characters got killed in one episode. There was also this white haired kid (forgot his name or wasn't even mentioned) which did some evil stuff and then disappeared 2-3 times.  Also got to mention Yomi is my favorite character!\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. Enjoyed the fight scenes, the sisters moments, and the family drama. This anime did its job of the demon-exorcist story, but also added overpowered \"spiritual beasts\" that wrecked stuff up, which was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: This anime is a without a doubt, a must see anime. You will definitely enjoy this anime if you watch it with an open mind, and don't pay attention on the small things. This anime started from an anime that I missed out on to being one of my all time favorites.  What's even better is this is a prequel so it only contains a small amount of the whole story since it continues in the manga. So some things such as character development might be resolved there.",

            "content": "After rewatching this series for the third time, I thought it was only fair to give Ga rei zero a proper review. Note that I\u2019ll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. \r\nGa rei zero was a pleasant surprise, defying my expectations of it based on its generic trailer and description. The first episode, in particular, was a \u201cwtfwhathappenediwanttowatchmore!\u201d attention grabber.\r\nOne of the better shows that aired in fall of 2008, Ga rei zero tells a tale of two young girls, Kagura and Yomi, their lives as they grow older, and the resulting tragedy that ensues.\r\nGa rei zero stands out for it\u2019s wellwritten plot, strong character development, and exorcism action. Ga rei zero can be depressing, somewhat disturbing, and very violent, yet overall has a very compelling story that keeps you going.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is the prequel to the manga Ga rei. It provides an extensive backstory between Isayama Yomi and Tsuchimiya Kagura, who appear in the manga Ga rei.  The true strength of this show is most definitely the story and characters.  This anime plays out as a epic human drama, exploring how family obligations, social norms, revenge, friendship, betrayal, love, hate, and intrigue all intertwine, with sometimes tragic results.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this story so powerful is how the writers deeply explore the heart warming (and heart wrenching) development of the relationship between Kagura and Yomi in painstaking detail; This fundamental relationship, and the conflicts that emerge from it, drives the entirety of the show. The story explores the making and breaking of a strong friendship, in this case the relationship between Yomi and Kagura. The sheer normalcy of the character\u2019s personalities shines through, creating genuinely great characters. This makes it all the more heartwrenching when the relationships in this series slowly, yet surely, are torn asunder.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is a simple, yet powerfully human tale at heart.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero proves  that it can define characters that go beyond simple good or evil. Instead, it shows us characters with multi-dimensional, complex characters, somewhat similar to how Miyazaki portrays his antagonists; as being a mix of both good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, Ga rei zero  has quite a bit of flashy fight scenes and battles; This series is almost certainly an action series in that regard. Ga rei zero is filled with battles between majestic mystical beasts, exceptional swordwielders, and \u2026 a fighter who uses a clothes iron as a weapon?\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, some of the weapons used in this show are the most unique weapons (such as a suitcase) I\u2019ve ever seen. As dubious as some of these weapons are, the action sequences are solid. The quick, and brutal, action packed scenes will almost definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was somewhat generic, although quite fitting for the scenes in the anime. It always seems to hit the right sound when needed, contributing to the exciting, and sometimes haunting, scenes littered throughout the show. Soundtracks are always a crucial part of any anime, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that the music definitely outdid itself in Ga rei zero.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.5/10 (rounded up to a 9 on myanimelist)\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is by no means a perfect show, but it delivers where it counts; a solid plot that is unusual enough to catch your attention, but not so complicated that you get confused or bored of the series. If you\u2019re looking for an action oriented series with a powerful, well developed story with excellent character development, Ga Rei zero could potentially fit the bill.\\n\\n\r\nMy expectations with this show went from little expectation, to curiosity, to awe as the plot culminated into a delightfully lovable, yet tragic story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those who do watch, I leave you a quote oft found in this series to think about:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWill you kill someone you love because of love?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is a copy of my original review, which can be found (somewhere ^.^;) at:\\n\r\nhttps://blogs.emory.edu/animec/\\n\\n\r\ncomments/feedback are welcome :]\\n",

Demon hunting, poorly done CG monster of the week, zombie like creatures, guro blood splatter and flying limbs, crazy fan-boy weapons, comedy. yuri girls in school uniforms, and run of the mill music.  Meh.  Seen it all a zillion times.  Watched a few eps, discovered nothing new and engaging and dropped it. \r\nPicked it up again in dub for something to have on in the background while I multi-tasked and was totally unimpressed until somewhere around episode 6 or 7.  THEN IT GOT GOOD.  Makethat Good with a capital G.  Character depth, relationships, motivations, it all worked and engaged me and ultimately surprised me with the ending . . . . which is actually the prequel for the manga and yet the anime manages to stand on its own merits.  Frankly, I found many of the supporting characters more interesting than the two lead girls but, given the fact that it was only a 12 ep series, there was no time to explore them further.  As usual, many of them ended up cannon fodder.  \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of the awkward CG monsters (they really put me off), the show has a very good look - nice character designs, and a color palate that hints at foreboding events yet to unfold.  \\n\\n\r\nI wish they had given me enough of the sophistication shown in the latter half of the show a little earlier on.  I would have enjoyed it in its entirety and not in fits and starts before I got to the tasty surprise inside.  For me, the first half was little better than average.  The last half an 8+.  I'll average it out as a 7 which really isn't a bad score.  7 = Good and ultimately GRZ was indeed good.",

It's not a perfect show, it's sometimes lacking in proper context, but it manages to work in such a way to keep me engaged to say \"yeah, I had a great time and felt immense satisfaction for something I wasn't the most hopeful for\".\r\nThroughout my time watching anime, I've begun toknow certain series aren't neccessarily good or bad in just a straightforward sense of accomplishing its goals well or not. Sometimes shows can be good at everything it does, sometimes they can do perfectly well at everything and not feel unexceptional anywhere, and sometimes  they can do one thing really really well to the extent where its issues can feel more obsolete in comparison. Ga-Rei Zero falls into this category.\\n\\n\r\nIn a future society where spirits can exist in the human world for the intended purpose of wiping them out, task forces are formed for the purpose of keeping the world safe from not only these spirits, but any humans allied with them for any reason, whether under control or by choice. We follow a particular task force unit in their job to keep the world safe, and then moves itself onto the story of how two sisters grew together, grew apart, found understanding and saw their passion until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who ever talks about this series will be quick to note the utter whiplash of the first episode, having the vibe of an action cop show, has with everything that follows it. However, it is my belief that the show's startling start not only gives a taste of what's the come following the end, in a similar vein to Berserk if it was properly followed up on in anime form, but it shows how even a team who seemed to have a strong bond with each other through thick and thin could be taken down with no remorse despite the killer never being wronged by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual main plot shown through the promotional image, is the story of two girls named Yomi and Kagura, raised like sisters after the latter lost her mother, as they work for a spirit hunting agency their parents were a part of while also bonding and protecting each other in the process, even if it does to their detriment or to everyone else. In a way, it reminds me not just of Berserk but also Star Wars Episode III, something those who have seen both will be able to attest to.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show focuses on Yomi and Kagura's relationship, and in my eyes, that aspect is the show's greatest strength. You see them originally as unfamiliar to each other, but they start to really appreciate each other's company through anything from sharing a house, to playing games with each other, to sharing pocky, to starting playful little strings of teasing, to wanting to push romantic relations for each other's sake, to helping to reassure each other despite how tough their job could be and what they might sacrifice, and finally what differences between them could tear them apart. Most of the scenes of them together are often pretty heartwarming, to make this sisterly relationship feel genuine, and the amount of time devoted to this aspect makes events that start to occur later seem a lot more personal than they might've been otherwise. You grow to want these two to stay together through everything that happens to them, thinking about the future could be heartbreaking. Other elements about family, hierarchy, protection, trust and deceit slowly follow forward as different characters are faced with choices limited to their raw emotions. Without spoilers, the ending feels like the perfect way to finish off THIS particular story. There's more to do with the world at large, however the core tale, the one that makes up the main focus of this prequel, reaches a satisfying conclusion. The bonding element of the story, showing hearts torn and limits pushed, is really what made the show for me, even in spite of some issues that could otherwise hold it back. \\n\\n\r\nOne particular issue is the ambiguity. Because this anime is a prequel to a pre-existing manga series, certain elements aren't very well explained. Most of it revolves around the spirit world. What are all of the varieties of monsters? Why do specific spirits show up at certain places? How do, basically the Head Crabs from Half-Life, make their way from place to place and why do they have more humanity than the other spirits? And most importantly, what is there to the main antagonist's plan/motivation and why he uses butterflies as assistance? The majority of these questions could be important, and it does feel a loss for this, however as far as the main story goes, they aren't entirely deal breakers. The main villain has a specific goal in the story however ambiguous, but the reaction from our heroines is what ends up being the most important. Second is the use of an early episode and a later episode. The latter episode has more context going into it and a handful of new scenes, but for the most part, the episode is basically shot for shot of the early episode. Not the worst thing in the world, but it can seem tiring to see the same episode twice on rewatch. Thirdly, the school setting. It's the type of thing that really feels like a crutch for writers when they don't have another idea to go further with their story. This works, once, at one point when Kagura experiences something, but otherwise isn't the most needed.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise though, the story is handled pretty efficiently. There's thrills, bonding, action, shocking plot twists, and even a bit of mystery here or there. The plot prioritized its most important element, and in the long run, that was a benefit.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the world of Ga-Rei Zero itself is not the most original, I do appreciate how well they mix the modern elements of detective agencies with the more traditional Japanese uniforms and outfits. We see elements such as the burden of carrying on tradition, how far your work can take you over the edge, and the difference between hierarchy and family, mixed with Men in Black style episodic missions to show off the form of work/how a rookie learns to accept their role on the job with all burdens associated even with what happens to their mentor. This dichotomy gives the show a good sense of identity, moreso than something like Blue Exorcist where there's just an ordinary school in a world populated with demons, or Mahouka where it has nothing more than a future city area the whole run. It does what it is necessary in Ga-Rei Zero to have something of an identity without being too ambitious in a 12 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, if I could describe the animation in one word, it would be \"efficient\". Although the production values are not the greatest, especially around the time when shows like Soul Eater and Code Geass R2 were airing, they get the job done wherever they need to.  Fight animation directed by Ei Aoki of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai fame is made out to feel kinetic without feeling overly flashy, and the lighting in certain scenes helps to set the tone, whether it be mysterious,heartwarming, melancholic, or action packed intensity. The amount of different weapons from Katanas to briefcase guns, as well as the variety of spirits definitely help the series, and even the one CGI spirit blends quite well, surprising for a studio that animated one of anime's most jarring CGI creatures in Deus Ex Machina from Mirai Nikki. The production values do everything they need to do in order to help the show's delivery and the tone of whatever scene its placed in, even if they aren't exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound though, I feel does a great job consistently. The OP itself has a fairly good melody that helps to convey the action packed scenes, in addition to the parts where the show could be hopeful or melancholic, with some of its visual content being standard fair, but other parts feeling like more than that. That's Mother's Basement department. The ED similarly has an idea of melancholy to it despite the rocking start, but in addition, has a small detail at the end that changes after a little bit, to make something seem all the more tragic. The OST itself was low key for most of the show but well utilized in the battle scenes, especially the more personal ones near the end of the show, which were definitely elevated by their music choices.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters in the series go, the main focus is on the two girls who treat themselves like sisters, Yomi and Kagura, and the trials and tribulations that their jobs and their outlooks put them through at the hands of the main villain. Others are there, but mainly serve as supplements for that particular purpose.\\n\\n\r\nKagura, the show's main protagonist, is the type who goes from being curious to optimistic to nervous shattered to eventually achieving a result. This type of protagonist would be seen later with characters such as Madoka in Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Akane from Psycho Pass, but I feel Kagura's change of feelings seems more natural. We follow her very early on, in an unfamiliar environment with only her sister to guide her. That is her strongest bond, but she does not allow it to overwhelm her. That comes from the burden her new job as a spirit hunter contains, and her reaction to the job, and what came after felt exceptionally natural. She has a sense of potential that continues to grow, and by the end of the show, she comes out with more confidence for her future despite what she was driven to do. \\n\\n\r\nYomi, who appears like an older sister to her, finds herself torn between her bond towards her sister, and her job as a spirit hunter to train her and represent the needs to her family. She's put in scenarios where she can have hopes, yet at the same time see the possibility of them crashing, driving her further and further over the edge to the point where her intense affection for Kagura becomes a weakness, one that sets her apart from everyone besides her, and one that in addition to the circumstances the villain's plan keeps putting on her, overwhelms her logic. There's a point where she's broken too far beyond repair and it was a cruel mix of satisfying and worrying. There was certainly some unneeded pushing into achieving her position she occupies at the start of the series, but not enough to completely undermine her fall. I felt for her more in 12 episodes than I did for Anakin Skywalker in three movies.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are basically supplemental but passable. From the girl's fathers, to the head of the Environmental Area of the Spirit Agency, to the school friends, to Yomi's fianc\u00e9 to even the main villain as an apparent afterthought, despite his manipulations at work to arrange the current plot events and nice design. As well, the character of Master Michael felt like a jarring tone shift entirely, and not in a fun way.\\n\\n\r\nThe one possible exception is Mei Isayama, a character driven with similar ambitions to Yomi, but one who lacked the mental fortitude to continue along her goal beyond a simple use. She also has a role in helping Kagura advance on in Kagura's own development, but in a way that, unlike Yomi, doesn't let her hide her frustration, and be brought too easily at the ends of power. Her character's role does a nice job of assisting the story to its current stage, through influence on the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough most of the show's cast puts itself around Yomi and Kagura, they still do their jobs efficiently, and convey everything the show attempted to accomplish in its 12 episode run. In many ways, I can understand where there was a strong central focus. With only so little time, creating a sense of empathy for a large cast would be difficult, so the centralized approach works in the show's favor.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Ga-Rei Zero, despite being too ambiguous for its own good, manages to pull through with a well told story of bonding, connections, revelations and heartbreak, some nice animation sequences, a well utilized soundtrack and a strong leading focus. I was surprised that I ended up liking the show this much despite its not great score and its status as a prequel material, but it was an interesting and heart rending ride despite that, one that proves that something doesn't have to be the best at everything in order to be a well done series.",

Well never have i seen a show that was of to such a bad start.  The first episode is just horrible, it looks like a mediocre demon hunting show with absolutely no depth in it at all.  Watching the second episode won`t even change your mind about that...  But if you for some reason keep watching a true gem of a show starts to unfold.  What really ruined thefirst few episodes for me was the HORRIBLE CGI they used...my god, prepare for something amateurism like you hardly saw in your life...the person responsible for this should never get a job again in Anime.  Even the design of the monsters/demons is not something that will blow you away...  So yes, this show has a difficult start, BUT time for the good news, watching the entire series, i must say i enjoyed it a lot, This is actually a show with good action, some good emotion, nice characters and it just seems to get better episode after episode.  The story is indeed a demon hunting story, were we follow a team of exorcists.  The rest you will have to see for yourself, but it has some nice surprises waiting for you.  Don`t be put of by the beginning of this show, watch it, and know for a fact that patience will be rewarded.  Ga-Rei: Zero  was an awesome show to me : )",

Makes sense, since it is titled Ga-Rei \"-Zero-.\"\r\nGa-Rei -Zero- is a series with many surprises. The first two episodes misled me into thinking that this was an action-packed anime with little drama or deep themes. But the entire series as a whole was deeply touching, focusing more on the friendship and love between two protagonists, Tsuchimiya Kagura and Isayama Yomi, as they go through thick and thin down a path that eventually splits into two.\r\nI was deeply impressed with the presentation of Ga-Rei -Zero-. Thefirst two episodes are almost unrelated to the entire story, but helps viewers to get a better understanding of the situation. Afterward, Ga-Rei -Zero- focuses on the central plot of the story with little to no episodic plots. There are some comedic parts to lighten the mood here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were skillfully designed and came alive in Ga-Rei -Zero-. Through various interactions, each character, even minor ones, developed and changed throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were good. Many of the fast-pace battle scenes were very smooth and exciting to watch as the characters and their surroundings changed constantly and smoothly. The many different background music fitted many scenes, whether they were comedic or serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ga-Rei -Zero- was very impressive, and I suggest those who enjoy well thought out anime should definitely watch it. However, it is a bit melancholic and serious, so for those who enjoy a lighthearted anime, look elsewhere.",

But that was mad up for in how cool they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Though there wasnt much of an intro or ending theme to speak of in the first episode, the background music was phenominal and well placed. As well as all of the sound effects, every thing about the sound fit perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- again this is the first episode so they couldnt get too much characterization done, but what they did to was very enjoyable. the main character Touru is torchered by &quot;that man&quot; and wants revenge for the death of his girlfriend. Ill stop there so I dont give away too much but as far as the first episode goes the characters are very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- this is a fantastically done show and look forward to the coming episodes, although there was a huge twist at the end that makes me wonder what will happen... so yeah stop reading this and go watch it!!",

            "content": "Ga-Rei Zero (directed by Ei Aoki of Kara no Kyoukai and Girls Bravo fame), is a prequel to Hajime Segawa's Ga-Rei, a manga in which two teenagers fight evil, may or may not fall in love, and mostly have a good time. Zero was obviously made to introduce more people to the series and get them to read the run-off-the-mill source material, but in the end, it entirely outclasses the manga itself.\r\nThose are my thoughts on the entire Ga-Rei franchise in a nutshell. Like most viewers, I had never heard of the series before this animated prequel aired, but I tried reading some manga chaptersafterwards to be able to put it all into perspective. Ga-Rei Zero starts off with two oddball episodes, designed to get the viewer hooked by means of suspense and gore. Those two didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the show&rsquo;s strongest points however. In the end, it was the for anime unusually convincing drama which makes it jump from the crowd. But let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves and start with&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nThe story (Please note the story only starts come episode 3)\\n\r\nZero takes place two years before the events of the manga. Here, Kagura Tsuchimiya is the heir to a powerful family of exorcists, who do battle with evil spirits and other such nasty supernatural things you don&rsquo;t want to meet in a dark alley, or can&rsquo;t because they wouldn&rsquo;t fit in said alley. Why do they do this? Because it&rsquo;s their duty! Moving on, Kagura moves in with another family of exorcists because her own father doesn&rsquo;t have time to take care of his daughter and there she continues to grow as an exorcist (read: magical girl) with new-found sister Yomi by her side. But, evil has many forms! Dun-dun-duuun.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it&rsquo;s thin, it&rsquo;s standard, it&rsquo;s not Jules Verne (in fact, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like Shakespeare). But what Ga-Rei Zero does well is taking a simple premise which doesn&rsquo;t need explaining (because it&rsquo;s featured in at least 80% of the stories in this little industry) and run from there by covering subjects which the show&rsquo;s biggest inspiration, Sailor Moon, leaves untouched. Zero is, besides a coming-of-age story, really about the bond between two specific characters, placed in an all too familiar (anime-)situation. The twist this show offers includes a lot of doubt, self-resentment and crying. Think of it as Evangelion if you will, though that might be a bit too extreme of an example.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nMain cast &ndash; Kagura and Yomi, that&rsquo;s what Ga-Rei Zero is about. I cannot stretch this enough. So, as one would expect, much time (of 12 episodes) is spent on the development of both main characters and it really, really pays off towards the end. Kagura fulfills the role of the empty shell (the Shinji) who has to deal with all sorts of stuff girls her age shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with, and though she finally makes some decisions near the end, she lets most of the show&rsquo;s events wash over her completely. Which worked rather well, for me at least. One of the most vital aspects to Kagura&rsquo;s personality is actually the extent to which she loves Yomi, and luckily, this is one of the things the creators got absolutely right. You will love Yomi, possibly more than Kagura herself. There&rsquo;s just not a whole lot to hate about her; she&rsquo;s a caring, endearing and beautiful older sister, who is strong in any conceivable way and will always think of her friends first without being a pushover. She&rsquo;s the type of person the viewer can look up to, and that, again, is exactly how Kagura views her. As you can tell, it all comes together neatly. And because of that, it&rsquo;s all the more painful when, well, certain things happen to our beloved duo near the end. Overall, character development on the two main characters is exceptionally well done and many key scenes are very well written. This is definitely the one part which carries the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast &ndash;  Good thing the focus is on Yomi and Kagura throughout the series then, because the supporting cast is absolutely laughable. There&rsquo;s a half-naked guy here, with a white afro on his head &aacute;nd on his breast (think village elder from Hare + Guu) who speaks with an American accent and makes weapons out of teapots and refridgerators. There are twins here who both share the same name (Nabuu), have the vocabulary of a caveman, usually finish eachother&rsquo;s sentences and present themselves in third person. It&rsquo;s probably just me, but these are exactly the kind of characters I can&rsquo;t stand, even if they&rsquo;re voiced by Norio Wakamoto himself (the Nabuu brothers are, by the way). Other characters also seem to have been ripped entirely from a show with similar themes, Mai-HiME; a biker girl named Kasuga Natsuki and a certain mysterious, cynical, evil white-haired boy come to mind, but let&rsquo;s not forget the magical girl squad team leader in a wheelchair and her female cohort either. It should be clear that this show doesn&rsquo;t develop its minor characters, simply because it has only 12 episodes to fill. They&rsquo;re a colourful bunch, I&rsquo;ll give them that, but they&rsquo;re absolutely not believable and I literally screamed in agony when the naked guy appeared in one of the most dramatic moments near the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound\\n\r\nAnimation &ndash; Definitely above average. The overall style is a little dark, but so is the story, so no problem there. The scenery is average, some CG won&rsquo;t blend with the surroundings completely and stillscreens are being used a lot near the end, but the animation is almost flawless and everything looks consistent. As for character designs there&rsquo;s once again a huge gap between the main cast and supporting cast; Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s appearances fit their characters spot-on while some other characters could&rsquo;ve looked a little less silly. Then again, because of that, this is definitely not the sort of show where you have trouble telling the characters apart. Monster designs are a little uninspired at times, but the show doesn&rsquo;t go into great depth as to what drives these enemies and where they come from anyway; they&rsquo;re exorcist fodder and their appearance tells us the same thing. Overall though, Ga-Rei Zero is certainly pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound &ndash; Not really omnipresent, but the show definitely contains some carefully constructed tunes to amplify the many moments of both action and drama. Especially in the first two episodes the creators had some fun playing with sound effects and so these are also well done. I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to the OP and ED songs on my iPod, but they&rsquo;re definitely solid and go well with the show, not only because they&rsquo;re sung by Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s voice actors. As mentioned before, Emperor Wakamoto is in this show and so I will have to give &ldquo;sound&rdquo; at least an 8, but the voice-acting overall is pretty solid. The only gripe I have with this aspect of the show may be Kagura&rsquo;s voice, but then again there&rsquo;s not a lot of teenage girls in anime whose voice I do like. Yomi on the other hand is really well done and so is her boyfriend, Noriyuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nPure, old-fashioned enjoyment in this show comes from battle choreography. The fighting in Ga-Rei Zero looks absolutely spectacular; it&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s clever, but also a little&hellip; underdeveloped. Most action anime spend a lot of time talking about strategies, specific moves, they discuss their enemies&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses, they get new moves, etcetera. Zero doesn&rsquo;t have all that. Fights never take too long, either, as opposed to in many a shounen title (let me remind you again Zero only runs for 12 episodes). While some may be glad to hear this, it really has its downsides in that you never know what a character is thinking or trying to do. There are no rules. You just wait until one of two sides has been beaten to a bloody pulp, because before that, nothing is certain. If certain characters from this show would play Counter-Strike, they&rsquo;d be kicked for hacking all the damn time.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up\\n\r\nGa-Rei Zero suffers of two things. Firstly, it&rsquo;s made as an advertising prequel to a pretty underwhelming manga series. Why that is a problem will be made painfully obvious to the viewer in episode 12, but I can already you that you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to get satisfactory closure, as the producers want you to read the manga sequel as well. Second, the show only has time to fully develop two characters, which it does a great job at, but there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to the Ga-Rei universe than Zero has a chance of presenting to the viewer (I mentioned the 12 episode limit several times before). The creators shouldn&rsquo;t have had any problem filling up 26 episodes with Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s tale and in case they did, it probably would&rsquo;ve have been one of my favourites of all time. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, tough luck. Even if its drawbacks scare you, Ga-Rei Zero is still one of the best anime all year (2008) and I think despite its heavy focus on human drama, there&rsquo;s still plenty to like here for viewers with varying tastes. Of course, there&rsquo;s only one way to find out if the show suits your tastes and that&rsquo;s just watching it yourself. I hope this wall of text has informed you well, I&rsquo;m giving Zero a rare 9 out of 10 because I&rsquo;m sure these 12 episodes of animation will stay with me for far longer than most.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything you did not like about this review, anything you did like, or anything that just caught your attention for no particular reason, I welcome all feedback on my profile.",

            "content": "One of the better animes I've ever seen. Top notch stuff. Everything about this anime was just really well done. I loved the characters, (even if most of them were portrayed differently from the manga). There was action, there was comedy, and there was sorrow. Everything really was put together beautifully.\r\nStory- Very interesting story. I didn't read the manga so even when I started watching it, it wasn't outrageously hard to understand. I actually didn't know this was a prequel till later, so that's a good sign at how easy the story was to follow.What I have to say about it thought was about howmisleading the first episode was. Not gonna spoil too much, but there's a hot chick on a motorcycle wearing a tight orange jump suit. Mmmmm sexy.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Art was A+ in my book. I've never been big on the realistic look. I've always enjoyed the slightly cartooney and colorful art style, and Ga-Rei -Zero- had that. The fight scenes were great. They were easy to follow, and featured some really bad ass moves. Definitely the type of shounen somebody might like if they enjoyed giant monsters fighting each other and ridiculous fight scenes pulled off by little girls. Gotta see it to believe it, but once again, A+ grade stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Sound was good. Loved the voice actors, they worked really well to pull off the characters emotions.  Sound track fitted the situations nicely and I liked it alot. I'm never to picky with sound, but Ga-Rei -Zero- was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Awesome character development. I really felt for them in their times of peril, anger, and joy. They each fitted into the story nicely, and all played their parts. They had some love going on in their (which I adored cause pairings are what make animes worth watching when people aren't hacking each others heads off), and some slight yuri if you could call it that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Enjoyed this to put it simply. It was fun to watch, I rarely got bored (it had it's slow moments) but they were able to pull through with some gut busting fights. Still nice for those who enjoy the mystery and suspension of wondering what's gonna happen next. It had it's drama, and all in all, it was a really well rounded anime that I think a lot of people could easily enjoy, even if they don't like the whole shounen idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Definitely one of the best animes I've ever seen, like I've said before. It had everything I liked. A little love, drama, action, fanservice. It was awesome. I recommend it for anyone to watch.",

            "content": "My first review so ... here it goes :\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Ga-Rei -Zero- is focused around Tsuchimiya Kagura , Isayama Yomi and a little on the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where they work as exorcists who \" exterminate those who spread the taint of death to the human world \" . You get to see during this anime some interesting and good fights, a slice of Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s sisters-like life their having with a little touch of shoujo-ai here and there and the conflicts that lead to how the manga&rsquo;s story started ( from what I heard since I have yet to read Ga-Rei) .\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good in my opinion and it&rsquo;s pleasant to watch. The fights are good and very interestingly animated with weapons you don&rsquo;t usually get to see, but here are used as exorcist weapons. Everything looks well in place (even if sometimes the quality is not top notch) fit together to make a good show: characters, creatures, background &hellip; everything. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound &hellip; to be honest I can&rsquo;t really talk a lot here besides the OP that is totally awesome and the ED is good also, and besides this the sound is well fit together with the scenes so I don&rsquo;t recall anything sounding annoying.  So I&rsquo;ll just leave the sound to a good after this being said.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good part of Ga-Rei &ndash;Zero- . There are a lot of interesting supporting characters that fill your episodes with joy and excitement (especially in the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where most of them are from). The main characters are also interesting and develop well during this anime, you learn a lot about their past and you see them grow emotionally and in terms of fighting power also. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment I can say that I really liked this anime &hellip; interesting fights, weapons, creatures, characters and a catchy opening. Didn&rsquo;t get bored during this anime at all and that&rsquo;s good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a good anime that packs some good action, enjoyable slice of life with a little touch of shoujo-ai and comedy &hellip; and its good for a large variety of viewers and does not disappoint the audience after they finished it.\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers Ahoy!\r\nGa-rei&hellip; where to begin&hellip; Apparently this is based of a manga with the same (or similar title). I have to admit that I was fairly confused by the first episode, which almost never happens to me&hellip; this might be because I never read the original source material. I think, for this one, I&rsquo;ll start with the production value. Overall, the PV was amazing. The animation was fluid and precise, the artwork never suffered many flaws, and the few tiny flaws that it did suffer from are really of no concern. The characters have a decent range of emotional expression, which one really doesn&rsquo;t seemuch these days. The music was good too. It had a bit of a Ghost in the Shell vibe to it, without Yoko Kanno&rsquo;s musical genius. The show did have the tendency to rely on CG a bit heavily, but it was decent CG, and I think it made the Ghost in the Shell vibe even stronger (though production IG wasn&rsquo;t even involved with this.) Ladies and gentlemen, activate the spoiler tags, because here comes the first episode. We learn that the show focuses around a combat squadron that fights against the supernatural. The strongest of these squads is Squad 4, who the story revolves around. We get introduced to the squad, including the bespectacled, fringed commander, his young squeaky girl assistant, Masaki (who I like because he is weird and has glasses, much like myself), this big guy with a scar who said a Buddhist prayer, a girl with a motorcycle that she can kill things with, and the male lead who&rsquo;s name escapes me at the moment. The first scene is our male lead in front of a tombstone in a cemetery, and he has the first of many fucked-up flashbacks for the episode. From here on out, I&rsquo;ll call them FUFB. He see&rsquo;s this creepy kid with white hair, and he is standing over a body and surrounded in flames, then a gunshot is seen, and the male lead snaps back to reality. The motorcycle girl, Natsuki, picks up the male lead to bring him to the scene of a supernatural incident in progress. We first get to see a bunch of invisible zombie things, and they scare me a bit, called Category C, which I guess is low class. Then the main baddy for the show comes in. A Category B&hellip; A ROLLING, FLAMING CG DINOSAUR THAT SHOOTS FLAMING INVISIBLE ZOMBIES! I shit you not, this actually happens. Well, cut a long story short, the incident is solved after some bad-assery in a water plant&hellip; this is where stuff gets kind of fucked up. The lights flicker, and our friends from Squad 4 begin to die&hellip; which kind of weirded me out. Why introduce a bunch of characters if they all die? Well, a girl with a sword kills Masaki, and the other squad four members, pretty violently. The male lead desperately calls base for assistance, and we see that Mami-chan, the assistant to the director, has killed him, and has a face-hugger brain-sucker alien thing on her head&hellip; She speaks as two minds, and says &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be going ahead&rdquo; then shoots herself in the head&hellip; this show seems fucked up, eh? Male lead has another FUFB and sees the white haired child and the body again. The male lead is screaming &ldquo;Aoi&rdquo; which I guess is her name, and the girl with the sword (the one killing everybody) tries to convince him that she is no longer Aoi. Aoi stands up and walks toward male lead. Male lead pleads, Aoi presses against his gun, and he fires. As Aoi falls, a swarm of crystalline blue butterflies (which will most likely be recurring in this show) fly away. We snap back to reality, where the sword girl says &ldquo;I told you to give it up.&rdquo; She then proceeds to slay the male lead. As the credits role, there is no ED, just the almost surprisingly haunting environment noise of falling water. Overall, the show is pretty good, but I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s going on until the next episode. I give this in total an 8/10. The beginning makes it seem like it might be generic, but it was fucked up and confusing enough to hook me in for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by AIC spirits, airs Saturdays.

            "content": "I wasn't going to watch this, I can't remember why, but then one day I did...for some reason...and I'm so glad I did! \r\nI don't think there really is much story...I mean it's like a generic friend story and one friend goes to the dark side and then the light side has to bite the bullet and defeat the dark side and defeat their friend, ya know, Naruto like crap. Queue a shit load of build up trying to make the relationship between the two characters seem more believable and to try and make their final showdown more epic. Not that this series needs itsfights to be anymore epic, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is incredible, it drops a little but never greatly or enough to ruin the show. And the art in the manga is VERY bad so it was nice to see how nice looking this was, with fluid fights (something else the manga lacked). Everything just looked plain awesome. Plus it was nice to see such random weapons, Irons and Suitcases for example (both of which were surprisingly badass).  Plus Yomi is just plain beautiful, I think I'm in love.  \\n\\n\r\nI never really know what to say for sound, yeah the soundtracks great, yeah the voice work is great. Pretty much sums it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite bland, you have a pervert, a gay pervert, a coward, twins, sisters etc etc nothing really pushes the boundaries but all the characters are likeable or funny or hot or use a technique or weapon that makes them badass. You forget how bland they are when they're kicking ass and taking names.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, someway I feel that 12 episodes was too many, the way they did the intro and outro had  way to much overlap (one episode was basically one of the episodes from the beginning with new bits pushed in the gaps), it could have been broken down into half the episodes, same with the flashback within the flashback that took up most of the series and moved way to slowly, I think their could have been other ways to build up the relationship between Kagura and Yomi and it be enjoyable for us at the same time. This could have easily been 3 - 4 episodes shorter in my book and it woulda made it more enjoyable, you got long, slow boring flashback episodes that didn't really seem to fight juxtaposed with incredible action sequences which did fit. I just wish they wouldn't keep taking their foot off the gas pedal. I feel almost that my time was wasted, there seems to be no plans for a sequel and instead of creating a sorta tied up prequel it was more like an intro into the manga, like a really long advert, I think they coulda done more with the episodes, had their own side story that started at episode one and ended at episode twelve.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall there needs to be more anime like this, the action was incredible, the story was nothing new but it was the Ga-Rei quirks which made it more than just a generic shounen. Sacred Beasts, Irons, Suitcases, twists and turns and characters that actually get their asses handed to them or died. Storywise it followed all the generic shounen patterns but it completely turned it on its head and it should be remembered for that. \\n\\n\r\nIf Bleach was seinen it'd be kinda like this...\\n\\n\r\nI have to make something clear for someone who didn't understand this review. What I liked about this series wasn't so much the content but what the series....stood for. \\n\\n\r\nIt took a rather generic shounen story and turned it on it's head. It was dark and bloody and crazy and shounen is aimed for boys whose balls ain't dropped yet. So for that I take my hat off. Too many shounens limit themselves because of what they're but every now and then a series goes \"FUCK YOU JUMP!\" and does whatever the hell it wants. So yeah the inner flashback was pretty shit. But sometimes it's not just about the content.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ga Rei: Zero\u2019s high octane first episode introduces us to a troupe of interesting characters, filled with spirited action, a dark storyline and\u2026 death. Within twenty-two minutes, it offers a plot twist to shock the viewer.  As a result, the quick pacing is disorienting, foreshadowing a show in love with combat and slacking on story.\r\nGa Rei: Zero is anything but that. From episode two, the narrative takes a decidedly steady stride after forcing our heads underwater. Letting us come up for air, its easy to take in the world. Set in an alternate version of Japan, the government is engaged in a secret warwith the paranormal enlisting the help of exorcists. Being from a family of exorcists herself, Kagura is pulled into the struggle of \u2018good vs. evil\u2019. Now in any other anime this set up would be an excuse for large-scale battles between spirits and their hunters. But Ga Rei: Zero uses it as a frame to focus on the associations of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nCentering on the relationship of the dark-haired Yomi and the younger Kagura, the story seems more slice of life than science fiction, as the two grow to love one another as sisters. At times it appears like the plot is having an identity crisis, focusing on the playful exchanges of the pair before shifting gears into a supernatural skirmish. While jarring at first blush, the writers took effort to weave the two strands together, carefully paving the heroine\u2019s path to a momentous climax.  \\n\\n\r\nMidnight hues evoke a gloom that haunts over the cast. Colors are appropriately muted during moments of tension. These scenes feel almost like watercolors at moments, fluorescent lighting casting a thin haze over the crisp drawings. Serving as the perfect stage, these set pieces host seamless animation, though the action can seem a bit stiff at times when slow motion is used. The only major detractor is the obtrusive CGI, a blending of cell shading and realistic textures, which feels out of place. A glaring example is the gargantuan Kasha beast in the first episode. Its flames look plastic and the edges of grey skin are jagged from poor aliasing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe brisk opening \"Paradise Lost\" by Minori Chihara has a tinge of pessimism while reflecting on the ties of love. It\u2019s pleasant to the ear while tied to the motifs of the Ga Rei: Zero, which is what every OP should do. The ending theme \"Yume no Ashioto ga Kikoeru\" by Mizuhara Kaoru is filled with melancholy, sober when compared to the Chihara\u2019s offering. Both pieces are excellent and are accompanied by an appropriate soundtrack that has a similar sound. The voice acting is done well, Kagura\u2019s innocence perfectly captured while Yomi\u2019s expressions are handled expertly from teasing to tender. Nothing really stands out from the supporting cast except for Mitogawa, the villain, whose innocent tone is both vacant and eerie.\\n\\n\r\nGa Rei: Zero offers the typical shounen tango of heroes and baddies as a young heroine comes to term with the assertive grip of \u2018destiny\u2019. Kagura questions if it\u2019s acceptable to kill the possessed corpses who still look human. The protagonist\u2019s vacillation is the girl\u2019s tragic flaw that inevitably leads her to the footsteps of the stunning conclusion. Admirably maturing Kagura through the twelve episodes from vulnerability to independence, Ga Rei: Zero executes an effective coming of age tale.\\n\\n\r\nYomi acts as a foil to Kagura\u2019s growth. As the story progresses, she becomes less and less grounded in reality. It\u2019s disheartening to watch her mentally unravel, her transformation is perversely beautiful as the once a supportive guide becomes the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the supporting characters are an expendable commodity in this production. The audience is introduced to a whole platoon of faces, from those in the Minstry of Defense, to those in the Agency. The program has no shame, liberally murdering likable persona throughout the installments.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a simple formula of mixing Ghostbusters, Men In Black, and a bit of high school drama, Ga Rei became a wildly popular manga in Japan. Ga Rei: Zero serves as a prequel to the drawn word, focusing on the relationship of Kagura and her adoptive sister Yomi. Narratives of this nature raise a few questions: Is it accessible to those who are not familiar with franchise? If so, does the program offer anything to those foreign to the series?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to both is an emphatic yes. Ga Rei: Zero serves a powerful story, wrought with impact, memorable characters and excellent production value. Not only does it reinforce the happenings of the main storyline, it seduces you into the dark embrace of Kagura\u2019s world, imploring that you give the manga at least a passing glance.",

Ga Rei Zero exceeded my expectations, and I definitelyyy am going to be reading the manga for it too after watching this anime.\r\nIt's been awhile since I felt like I found an anime I enjoyed an anime this much. Ga Rei Zero's description here on Myanimelist is quite brief, and it really doesn't tell you very much about the show, so you have to watch it to really find out what it's about. And it's actually quite fitting for this particular anime, because this anime tells has such anamazing storyline that you really have to give it a watch because simplifying this anime into a short summary would just make it sound much more bland than it really is. This anime is definitelyyyy worth giving it a shot. I was intrigued after episode 1, interested enough by episode 2 to want to continue to episode 3, and by episode 3 I was thoroughly captivated in Ga Rei Zero.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ga-Rei:Zero\r\n\"Will you kill someone you love, because of love?\" just seeing the tagline used in the anime, Ga-Rei definitely caught my attention, and it REALLY suit the anime. I was like WOW. Just from the tagline you can know what the main conflict will be. Despite that you will still feel eager to watch each episode.\r\nI gave this anime a 10 cause basically, I loved everything about it. From the pilot episode until the ending episode, I had my eyes glued on the screen, sitting at the edge of my chair, anxious about the what will happen in the next episode. I actually watched thisin one sitting cause I can't wait as to what will happen next. I even finished watching it at like 2 in the morning even though I have class that day ^^\\n\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, Ga:Rei's plot is its strongest point. It is something you don't see too often. Amongst few animes I have watched, Ga:Rei does not have any similarities in comparison to their plot.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked how they developed the way the anime starts and end. The pilot episode is something that really caught my interest. For me, the pilot and ending episode are the most important factor of the anime. This is for the reason that the first and last episodes are the episodes that leaves impression to the viewers. And Ga:Rei did not fail in both. Ga:Rei started the episode introducing the main and major conflict in the story (which, did I mention, is REALLY interesting, and did not really introduce the main characters 'till midway) and then flashes back on how the conflict started. The ending episode covers some of the scenes of the pilot episode, and it was an epic ending (though bittersweet). Action scenes are quite good too. I especially liked the scenes where Nori and Yomi are all love-love and L.Q. ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also great. I liked how the characters' personality changed because something inevitable happened. Any way I like their personality. I can't really point out what I liked about them. I just do^^\\n\\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\n*I really recommend this anime. You won't regret watching it. At first you might be saying to yourself \"oh, another supernatural anime, etc\" it does not actually quiet focus on it but focuses more on the bonds the characters have to the people surrounding them. Really nice anime, I even bought a DVD after watching it for free at some anime site ^^",

            "content": "When I started watchin Ga-Rei Zero, I never thought I would enjoy it so much. If in the beggining of the first episode I was surprised to see how full of action it was, at the end of the same episode I was like \"what the hell.. everybody dies. anime ends. go home\". (If you watched it you know what I'm taking about). And then in the second episode other characters die so I was kind of confused and said to myself \"No, no. Something is wrong here\". Well, the actual story starts with episode 3 so basically, the first 2 episodes have nothing todo with the rest of the series. I know it is weird but in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the storyline, I have to say it's pretty amazing. The two main characters, Yomi and Kagura, show us that the most important thing in the world is not family itself, but the persons who are not blood-related to you and still love you like they truly are. It's a sad story indeed, about friendship, family bonds, love and loyalty. Like many other animes, this one theaches us that with great power comes great sacrifice and unless you are emotionally strong you can't live the way Yomi and Kagura did.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is awesome! Those sad and peaceful melodies which play in the background of the most heartbreaking scenes are completely wonderful. I haven't seen an anime with such an appropriate music since a while. Moreover, given the powerful beginning with countinuous action I would've never thought the anime could be so sensitive.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character was Yomi. Although she turned into a villain, she died as hero, as a good person who only wished to protect the ones she loved. Yomi was (in my opinion) the most complex character of the series. She loved Kagura like her little sister, she loved her adoptive father like her real one and nevertheless, she loved noriyuki so much that she couldn't kill him. In spite of the fact that she was such a hearty person, the rest of the family hated her for not being blood-related to them (which I find incredibly hard to live with). I don't blame her for wanting revenge or for holding hatred against May and her uncle (whom she killed) and I definately don't blame her for wanting power after she ended up crippled. You know that saying: \"You weren't born evil. Life made you this way\". I think this pretty much sums up Yomi's life. Anyway, I was glad to see that in the end she let go of the hatred and realised there were still persons who cared about her. Too bad it was too late.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was full of unexpected but the fact that so many people had to die really saddened me. Their deaths were sooo sorrowful, they really got to my feels. What I liked most was how this uninterrupted action was combined in such a fine way with a remarkable life story and of course, unfulfilled love. There are 3 different things wrapped into a singel package. And this package is surprisingly good.",

            "content": "*Powerful opening episode plus a strong ending makes Ga-Rei Zero a definite must see for action fans.*\r\n\u201cWill you kill someone you love because of love?\u201d\r\nThose who have already seen Ga-Rei Zero (GRZ) are probably sick of reading the quote above, but it is nonetheless an effective quote to advertise for GRZ. I still remember what initially caught my interest in GRZ, it was the amazing trailer. Boy, how misleading it was \u2026 \r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Ga-Rei Zero is quite fabulous indeed. The synopsis may sound generic, but the technique used to present the story that will eventually lead into Ga-Rei (manga) is what makesthis gem a success in this recessional era. The excitement level of GRZ can be described by a simple parabolic function (think of the letter \u201cU\u201d), though the initial point stands out a lot more than the ending. This is analogous to say you drop a ball from great height and watch it fall down and slowly climb back up. But no matter how hard it tries, in the end it cannot go back to the initial height.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of GRZ is extremely well thought out and well executed to say the least. Given the length of the series it is a very enthralling little show. Demon hunting may be the first thing come to mind after reading the simple summary of the anime. But what lies beneath that outer layer is the fragile little thing known as friendship and what happens to it when that treasure betrays oneself; that is the true moral of the story. Please keep in mind that GRZ is simply the prequel to the actual story in Ga-Rei (manga) thus you may find some unsatisfactory conclusion with regards to certain people or certain things.\\n\\n\r\nGiant CG rolling dinosaurs on fire seem unnecessary but they served their purpose. The way some of the dramatic scenes were animated could have used a little more work. For instance it is possible to create a more nauseating scene by using a more unique camera angle/position rather than attempting to semi censor the scene with dull lifeless angles. On a more positive note, the animation quality is pretty consistent throughout the series and the characters themselves look great, especially when compared to the drawings in the manga. The battle animations are perhaps the most notable positive feature to the show. Fluid dynamic animation plus smooth scene to scene transitions also helped make GRZ one of the better animated shows of the season. It is evident that a lot of effort has been put into the show by the animation crew, even the backgrounds in each scene is very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nAs should be expected from an action oriented anime, the music is very outstanding. From the OP to battle BGM to ED, they all suit their theme well. The OP was nominated by fans as one of the top ten 2008 anime OP. Voicing-wise, Minori Chinhara was great playing as Kagura, and the unrecognizable voice change for the OP just makes it all the better. While there are not many superstar level seiyu (ie. award winners), it seems all characters received a suitable voice for themselves thus you will unlikely to have to clean your ears after watching each episode.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most single season anime, GRZ is not one where you should marathon through in a day. It is as if Ei Aoki (director of GRZ) just had an uncontrollable diarrhea. He literally dumps all the nasty stuff at you right from the start. You are bound to be confused after the first two episodes. Take it easy, we have all been through that stage. It will be tempting to keep on watching, but take my advice if you want to retain some sanity; stop there and think about what happened so far as things will go downhill from here.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t quite enjoy watching flying limbs or spurting blood, I suggest you stick to the TV release as they censored the \u201cugly\u201d stuff in most cases. I also don\u2019t recommend fans of Natsuki Kuga from Mai-HiME (or Natsuki Kruger in Mai Otome) to watch this as there is a certain someone here by the name of Natsuki Kasuga who also happens to be a motorbike chick with strong connection to dual wielding pistols. Though the difference here is how minor a role she plays and the cruel fate that awaits her.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I didn\u2019t enjoy about GRZ is the sudden appearance of cheesy RPG-like weapons after episode one. Bullet shooting suitcase? Metal drill knuckle? Outrageous combat wheelchair? None of that were in the trailer! And none of those were anywhere near as exciting as the hot motorbike or the dual pistols. Now that I think about it, I feel like I got trolled by the trailer. Anyway, aside from the opening episode I wouldn\u2019t call GRZ particular \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, but it is unquestionably one of the best (if not THE best) action anime for the fall season of 2008.",

            "content": "This review is technically spoiler free, but if the names, Yomi or Kagura, are unfamiliar to you, I would suggest watching the first two episodes before reading any of the reviews.\r\nAdmittedly, when I first read the show's description (which purposely reads generic), I didn't think the show was going to be that good. So when I gave it a shot, the first episode certainly drew my attention, but I expected once the shocking cliffhangers wore off it&rsquo;d be a pretty generic, demon-hunting, hero-coming-of-age shounen. \r\nMan, I was dead wrong. GRZ turned out to be biggest surprise of the fall season, and one of the bestdamn shows I&rsquo;ve seen, hands down.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters: GRZ has a simple story at its heart. The whole demon hunting setting is really just a conveniently action/guro-friendly wrapper for the real story: The making and the breakdown of a strong friendship. What makes the show so powerful is the great job the writers did in exploring and developing the relationship between Kagura and Yomi &ndash; that&rsquo;s when the show really starts to become something special. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the short 12 episode season doesn&rsquo;t allow them to provide much background on the other characters and also leaves some loose plot ends hanging (which is probably to be expected, since it&rsquo;s a prequel to the Ga-rei manga). \\n\\n\r\nBut all that&rsquo;s forgivable, because everything is really all just a foil to Kagura and Yomi in the end. The dynamic between the two drives the whole show. The comedy, the action, the drama and ultimately, the tragedy &ndash; everything &ndash; hinges on how much you come to like their characters and relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The battle scenes were well-animated and ranged from stylistic to quick and brutal, which despite the fantastic setting, made the show feel more realistic. The character designs were streamlined and attractive, with particular attention paid to Kagura and Yomi's cuteness/hotness. The monster designs were pretty generic, but they make up for it by making the mythical creatures, Ranguren and Byakuei, look appropriately fierce and majestic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The producers of GRZ took some bold sound design chances - such as forgoing the OP/ED in the initial episode - that helped to amp up the show's atmosphere. The music also stood out throughout the series, especially during the battle scenes: ranging from a rock/techno mix during the exciting, stylistic battles, to the haunting and emotional, vocal-driven arrangement during the final battle. It always seemed to hit the right chord. Voice work was very good with  special kudos due to Kaoru Mizuhara (Misao in Lucky Star) and Minori Chihara (Yuki Nagato in TMoHS), as Yomi and Kagura, doing excellent jobs in roles that I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected from them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: If you're looking for a well-written, action-oriented show (admittedly, not for the squeamish) with really strong character development, I highly recommend GRZ.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this review was helpful to you. (Positive/negative) feedback is always appreciated. Thanks!",

            "content": "Ga-Rei -Zero- is set as the prequel to Ga-Rei the manga. The manga, itself, is a supernatural action shounen so Ga-Rei -Zero- is set in the same way. While knowing the setting of the manga helps to understand the anime better, it is definitely not required to read the manga beforehand to enjoy Ga-Rei -Zero-. This viewer had never heard of Ga-Rei before the anime, yet was still able to enjoy the Ga-Rei -Zero-.\r\nFor those not familiar with the Ga-Rei setting, it is essentially about an agency that hunts rogue spirits using exorcists. A Ga-Rei is a spirit beast that exorcists use in addition toother exotic weapons and traditional swords to fight supernatural enemies.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The storytelling for Ga-Rei was nothing short of amazing. The first two episodes occur chronologically towards the end of the series, but set up a conflict during which the rest of the series tries to explain how events lead up to such a conflict. This leaves the viewer constantly guessing throughout the series, giving enjoyment through suspense. At the same time, the viewer is greeted with several humorous scenes through the show that help lighten the mood and make you enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation for Ga-Rei isn't extraordinary or anything. It gets the job done. The supernatural enemies look disgusting and allow you to develop a hatred for them. The characters are drawn in a way that you develop interest in them. The action looks fluid and is pleasing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: What really stood out to me in Ga-Rei was the sound. The background music really fit the mood well and after every episode, it left me questioning when the OST would come out. Furthermore, the Ga-Rei anime comes out with an amazing image and insert song CD, many of the songs which are used in fitting moments throughout Ga-Rei. Both the OP and ED fit the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Ga-Rei really focuses on developing the two main characters, Kagura and Yomi. While I feel that the other characters weren't developed as much as I would have liked, the story is really focused on Kagura and Yomi and only their development is crucial to the story. The way Kagura and Yomi interact together and towards other characters seems appropriate for their age and their past experiences and because of their interaction with each other, they change and part of the story is watching their growth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The combination of a great storyline as well as well-done action sequences put to an outstanding soundtrack makes this anime incredibly enjoyable for me. Once you start the anime, at least for the first couple of episodes, it's almost impossible to stop. The first few episodes demand the viewer to watch them one after another. Combined with the humorous yuri moments and other cute moments, Ga-Rei does its best to tell a story that can both standalone, but at the same time, persuade the viewer to continue the series into the manga.",

I have to say that the first episode's animation could of been more appealing.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound:  I don't pay attention to the sound effects as much, but I said they were good. I really liked the opening song, probably one of the few I don't skip. \\n\\n\r\n-Character: I say this is one of the good aspect of Ga-Rei: Zero. Within the flashbacks, you really get the chance to know more about Yomi and Kagura. You get to find out what their families expect from them, what they been through, and you get to see the change from when they first met to the last scene. Yomi and Kagura were well developed, but supporting characters were not as much. Maybe due to the fact that a bunch of characters got killed in one episode. There was also this white haired kid (forgot his name or wasn't even mentioned) which did some evil stuff and then disappeared 2-3 times.  Also got to mention Yomi is my favorite character!\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. Enjoyed the fight scenes, the sisters moments, and the family drama. This anime did its job of the demon-exorcist story, but also added overpowered \"spiritual beasts\" that wrecked stuff up, which was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: This anime is a without a doubt, a must see anime. You will definitely enjoy this anime if you watch it with an open mind, and don't pay attention on the small things. This anime started from an anime that I missed out on to being one of my all time favorites.  What's even better is this is a prequel so it only contains a small amount of the whole story since it continues in the manga. So some things such as character development might be resolved there.",

            "content": "After rewatching this series for the third time, I thought it was only fair to give Ga rei zero a proper review. Note that I\u2019ll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. \r\nGa rei zero was a pleasant surprise, defying my expectations of it based on its generic trailer and description. The first episode, in particular, was a \u201cwtfwhathappenediwanttowatchmore!\u201d attention grabber.\r\nOne of the better shows that aired in fall of 2008, Ga rei zero tells a tale of two young girls, Kagura and Yomi, their lives as they grow older, and the resulting tragedy that ensues.\r\nGa rei zero stands out for it\u2019s wellwritten plot, strong character development, and exorcism action. Ga rei zero can be depressing, somewhat disturbing, and very violent, yet overall has a very compelling story that keeps you going.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is the prequel to the manga Ga rei. It provides an extensive backstory between Isayama Yomi and Tsuchimiya Kagura, who appear in the manga Ga rei.  The true strength of this show is most definitely the story and characters.  This anime plays out as a epic human drama, exploring how family obligations, social norms, revenge, friendship, betrayal, love, hate, and intrigue all intertwine, with sometimes tragic results.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this story so powerful is how the writers deeply explore the heart warming (and heart wrenching) development of the relationship between Kagura and Yomi in painstaking detail; This fundamental relationship, and the conflicts that emerge from it, drives the entirety of the show. The story explores the making and breaking of a strong friendship, in this case the relationship between Yomi and Kagura. The sheer normalcy of the character\u2019s personalities shines through, creating genuinely great characters. This makes it all the more heartwrenching when the relationships in this series slowly, yet surely, are torn asunder.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is a simple, yet powerfully human tale at heart.\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero proves  that it can define characters that go beyond simple good or evil. Instead, it shows us characters with multi-dimensional, complex characters, somewhat similar to how Miyazaki portrays his antagonists; as being a mix of both good and bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, Ga rei zero  has quite a bit of flashy fight scenes and battles; This series is almost certainly an action series in that regard. Ga rei zero is filled with battles between majestic mystical beasts, exceptional swordwielders, and \u2026 a fighter who uses a clothes iron as a weapon?\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, some of the weapons used in this show are the most unique weapons (such as a suitcase) I\u2019ve ever seen. As dubious as some of these weapons are, the action sequences are solid. The quick, and brutal, action packed scenes will almost definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was somewhat generic, although quite fitting for the scenes in the anime. It always seems to hit the right sound when needed, contributing to the exciting, and sometimes haunting, scenes littered throughout the show. Soundtracks are always a crucial part of any anime, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that the music definitely outdid itself in Ga rei zero.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.5/10 (rounded up to a 9 on myanimelist)\\n\\n\r\nGa rei zero is by no means a perfect show, but it delivers where it counts; a solid plot that is unusual enough to catch your attention, but not so complicated that you get confused or bored of the series. If you\u2019re looking for an action oriented series with a powerful, well developed story with excellent character development, Ga Rei zero could potentially fit the bill.\\n\\n\r\nMy expectations with this show went from little expectation, to curiosity, to awe as the plot culminated into a delightfully lovable, yet tragic story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those who do watch, I leave you a quote oft found in this series to think about:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWill you kill someone you love because of love?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis is a copy of my original review, which can be found (somewhere ^.^;) at:\\n\r\nhttps://blogs.emory.edu/animec/\\n\\n\r\ncomments/feedback are welcome :]\\n",

Demon hunting, poorly done CG monster of the week, zombie like creatures, guro blood splatter and flying limbs, crazy fan-boy weapons, comedy. yuri girls in school uniforms, and run of the mill music.  Meh.  Seen it all a zillion times.  Watched a few eps, discovered nothing new and engaging and dropped it. \r\nPicked it up again in dub for something to have on in the background while I multi-tasked and was totally unimpressed until somewhere around episode 6 or 7.  THEN IT GOT GOOD.  Makethat Good with a capital G.  Character depth, relationships, motivations, it all worked and engaged me and ultimately surprised me with the ending . . . . which is actually the prequel for the manga and yet the anime manages to stand on its own merits.  Frankly, I found many of the supporting characters more interesting than the two lead girls but, given the fact that it was only a 12 ep series, there was no time to explore them further.  As usual, many of them ended up cannon fodder.  \\n\\n\r\nWith the exception of the awkward CG monsters (they really put me off), the show has a very good look - nice character designs, and a color palate that hints at foreboding events yet to unfold.  \\n\\n\r\nI wish they had given me enough of the sophistication shown in the latter half of the show a little earlier on.  I would have enjoyed it in its entirety and not in fits and starts before I got to the tasty surprise inside.  For me, the first half was little better than average.  The last half an 8+.  I'll average it out as a 7 which really isn't a bad score.  7 = Good and ultimately GRZ was indeed good.",

            "content": "What changes you? How does it change you? Who is the one to bring you to your breaking point? How attached can you be to make such a change necessary?\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE FIRST EPISODE\r\nGa-Rei Zero is a story of change, bonds, corruption, and in the end, finding your place amongst class and expectations. It's not a perfect show, it's sometimes lacking in proper context, but it manages to work in such a way to keep me engaged to say \"yeah, I had a great time and felt immense satisfaction for something I wasn't the most hopeful for\".\r\nThroughout my time watching anime, I've begun toknow certain series aren't neccessarily good or bad in just a straightforward sense of accomplishing its goals well or not. Sometimes shows can be good at everything it does, sometimes they can do perfectly well at everything and not feel unexceptional anywhere, and sometimes  they can do one thing really really well to the extent where its issues can feel more obsolete in comparison. Ga-Rei Zero falls into this category.\\n\\n\r\nIn a future society where spirits can exist in the human world for the intended purpose of wiping them out, task forces are formed for the purpose of keeping the world safe from not only these spirits, but any humans allied with them for any reason, whether under control or by choice. We follow a particular task force unit in their job to keep the world safe, and then moves itself onto the story of how two sisters grew together, grew apart, found understanding and saw their passion until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who ever talks about this series will be quick to note the utter whiplash of the first episode, having the vibe of an action cop show, has with everything that follows it. However, it is my belief that the show's startling start not only gives a taste of what's the come following the end, in a similar vein to Berserk if it was properly followed up on in anime form, but it shows how even a team who seemed to have a strong bond with each other through thick and thin could be taken down with no remorse despite the killer never being wronged by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual main plot shown through the promotional image, is the story of two girls named Yomi and Kagura, raised like sisters after the latter lost her mother, as they work for a spirit hunting agency their parents were a part of while also bonding and protecting each other in the process, even if it does to their detriment or to everyone else. In a way, it reminds me not just of Berserk but also Star Wars Episode III, something those who have seen both will be able to attest to.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the show focuses on Yomi and Kagura's relationship, and in my eyes, that aspect is the show's greatest strength. You see them originally as unfamiliar to each other, but they start to really appreciate each other's company through anything from sharing a house, to playing games with each other, to sharing pocky, to starting playful little strings of teasing, to wanting to push romantic relations for each other's sake, to helping to reassure each other despite how tough their job could be and what they might sacrifice, and finally what differences between them could tear them apart. Most of the scenes of them together are often pretty heartwarming, to make this sisterly relationship feel genuine, and the amount of time devoted to this aspect makes events that start to occur later seem a lot more personal than they might've been otherwise. You grow to want these two to stay together through everything that happens to them, thinking about the future could be heartbreaking. Other elements about family, hierarchy, protection, trust and deceit slowly follow forward as different characters are faced with choices limited to their raw emotions. Without spoilers, the ending feels like the perfect way to finish off THIS particular story. There's more to do with the world at large, however the core tale, the one that makes up the main focus of this prequel, reaches a satisfying conclusion. The bonding element of the story, showing hearts torn and limits pushed, is really what made the show for me, even in spite of some issues that could otherwise hold it back. \\n\\n\r\nOne particular issue is the ambiguity. Because this anime is a prequel to a pre-existing manga series, certain elements aren't very well explained. Most of it revolves around the spirit world. What are all of the varieties of monsters? Why do specific spirits show up at certain places? How do, basically the Head Crabs from Half-Life, make their way from place to place and why do they have more humanity than the other spirits? And most importantly, what is there to the main antagonist's plan/motivation and why he uses butterflies as assistance? The majority of these questions could be important, and it does feel a loss for this, however as far as the main story goes, they aren't entirely deal breakers. The main villain has a specific goal in the story however ambiguous, but the reaction from our heroines is what ends up being the most important. Second is the use of an early episode and a later episode. The latter episode has more context going into it and a handful of new scenes, but for the most part, the episode is basically shot for shot of the early episode. Not the worst thing in the world, but it can seem tiring to see the same episode twice on rewatch. Thirdly, the school setting. It's the type of thing that really feels like a crutch for writers when they don't have another idea to go further with their story. This works, once, at one point when Kagura experiences something, but otherwise isn't the most needed.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise though, the story is handled pretty efficiently. There's thrills, bonding, action, shocking plot twists, and even a bit of mystery here or there. The plot prioritized its most important element, and in the long run, that was a benefit.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the world of Ga-Rei Zero itself is not the most original, I do appreciate how well they mix the modern elements of detective agencies with the more traditional Japanese uniforms and outfits. We see elements such as the burden of carrying on tradition, how far your work can take you over the edge, and the difference between hierarchy and family, mixed with Men in Black style episodic missions to show off the form of work/how a rookie learns to accept their role on the job with all burdens associated even with what happens to their mentor. This dichotomy gives the show a good sense of identity, moreso than something like Blue Exorcist where there's just an ordinary school in a world populated with demons, or Mahouka where it has nothing more than a future city area the whole run. It does what it is necessary in Ga-Rei Zero to have something of an identity without being too ambitious in a 12 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, if I could describe the animation in one word, it would be \"efficient\". Although the production values are not the greatest, especially around the time when shows like Soul Eater and Code Geass R2 were airing, they get the job done wherever they need to.  Fight animation directed by Ei Aoki of Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai fame is made out to feel kinetic without feeling overly flashy, and the lighting in certain scenes helps to set the tone, whether it be mysterious,heartwarming, melancholic, or action packed intensity. The amount of different weapons from Katanas to briefcase guns, as well as the variety of spirits definitely help the series, and even the one CGI spirit blends quite well, surprising for a studio that animated one of anime's most jarring CGI creatures in Deus Ex Machina from Mirai Nikki. The production values do everything they need to do in order to help the show's delivery and the tone of whatever scene its placed in, even if they aren't exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound though, I feel does a great job consistently. The OP itself has a fairly good melody that helps to convey the action packed scenes, in addition to the parts where the show could be hopeful or melancholic, with some of its visual content being standard fair, but other parts feeling like more than that. That's Mother's Basement department. The ED similarly has an idea of melancholy to it despite the rocking start, but in addition, has a small detail at the end that changes after a little bit, to make something seem all the more tragic. The OST itself was low key for most of the show but well utilized in the battle scenes, especially the more personal ones near the end of the show, which were definitely elevated by their music choices.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters in the series go, the main focus is on the two girls who treat themselves like sisters, Yomi and Kagura, and the trials and tribulations that their jobs and their outlooks put them through at the hands of the main villain. Others are there, but mainly serve as supplements for that particular purpose.\\n\\n\r\nKagura, the show's main protagonist, is the type who goes from being curious to optimistic to nervous shattered to eventually achieving a result. This type of protagonist would be seen later with characters such as Madoka in Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Akane from Psycho Pass, but I feel Kagura's change of feelings seems more natural. We follow her very early on, in an unfamiliar environment with only her sister to guide her. That is her strongest bond, but she does not allow it to overwhelm her. That comes from the burden her new job as a spirit hunter contains, and her reaction to the job, and what came after felt exceptionally natural. She has a sense of potential that continues to grow, and by the end of the show, she comes out with more confidence for her future despite what she was driven to do. \\n\\n\r\nYomi, who appears like an older sister to her, finds herself torn between her bond towards her sister, and her job as a spirit hunter to train her and represent the needs to her family. She's put in scenarios where she can have hopes, yet at the same time see the possibility of them crashing, driving her further and further over the edge to the point where her intense affection for Kagura becomes a weakness, one that sets her apart from everyone besides her, and one that in addition to the circumstances the villain's plan keeps putting on her, overwhelms her logic. There's a point where she's broken too far beyond repair and it was a cruel mix of satisfying and worrying. There was certainly some unneeded pushing into achieving her position she occupies at the start of the series, but not enough to completely undermine her fall. I felt for her more in 12 episodes than I did for Anakin Skywalker in three movies.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are basically supplemental but passable. From the girl's fathers, to the head of the Environmental Area of the Spirit Agency, to the school friends, to Yomi's fianc\u00e9 to even the main villain as an apparent afterthought, despite his manipulations at work to arrange the current plot events and nice design. As well, the character of Master Michael felt like a jarring tone shift entirely, and not in a fun way.\\n\\n\r\nThe one possible exception is Mei Isayama, a character driven with similar ambitions to Yomi, but one who lacked the mental fortitude to continue along her goal beyond a simple use. She also has a role in helping Kagura advance on in Kagura's own development, but in a way that, unlike Yomi, doesn't let her hide her frustration, and be brought too easily at the ends of power. Her character's role does a nice job of assisting the story to its current stage, through influence on the relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough most of the show's cast puts itself around Yomi and Kagura, they still do their jobs efficiently, and convey everything the show attempted to accomplish in its 12 episode run. In many ways, I can understand where there was a strong central focus. With only so little time, creating a sense of empathy for a large cast would be difficult, so the centralized approach works in the show's favor.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Ga-Rei Zero, despite being too ambiguous for its own good, manages to pull through with a well told story of bonding, connections, revelations and heartbreak, some nice animation sequences, a well utilized soundtrack and a strong leading focus. I was surprised that I ended up liking the show this much despite its not great score and its status as a prequel material, but it was an interesting and heart rending ride despite that, one that proves that something doesn't have to be the best at everything in order to be a well done series.",

Well never have i seen a show that was of to such a bad start.  The first episode is just horrible, it looks like a mediocre demon hunting show with absolutely no depth in it at all.  Watching the second episode won`t even change your mind about that...  But if you for some reason keep watching a true gem of a show starts to unfold.  What really ruined thefirst few episodes for me was the HORRIBLE CGI they used...my god, prepare for something amateurism like you hardly saw in your life...the person responsible for this should never get a job again in Anime.  Even the design of the monsters/demons is not something that will blow you away...  So yes, this show has a difficult start, BUT time for the good news, watching the entire series, i must say i enjoyed it a lot, This is actually a show with good action, some good emotion, nice characters and it just seems to get better episode after episode.  The story is indeed a demon hunting story, were we follow a team of exorcists.  The rest you will have to see for yourself, but it has some nice surprises waiting for you.  Don`t be put of by the beginning of this show, watch it, and know for a fact that patience will be rewarded.  Ga-Rei: Zero  was an awesome show to me : )",

            "content": "First of all, I have not read the manga, but I am told that this is a prequel to it. Makes sense, since it is titled Ga-Rei \"-Zero-.\"\r\nGa-Rei -Zero- is a series with many surprises. The first two episodes misled me into thinking that this was an action-packed anime with little drama or deep themes. But the entire series as a whole was deeply touching, focusing more on the friendship and love between two protagonists, Tsuchimiya Kagura and Isayama Yomi, as they go through thick and thin down a path that eventually splits into two.\r\nI was deeply impressed with the presentation of Ga-Rei -Zero-. Thefirst two episodes are almost unrelated to the entire story, but helps viewers to get a better understanding of the situation. Afterward, Ga-Rei -Zero- focuses on the central plot of the story with little to no episodic plots. There are some comedic parts to lighten the mood here and there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were skillfully designed and came alive in Ga-Rei -Zero-. Through various interactions, each character, even minor ones, developed and changed throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were good. Many of the fast-pace battle scenes were very smooth and exciting to watch as the characters and their surroundings changed constantly and smoothly. The many different background music fitted many scenes, whether they were comedic or serious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ga-Rei -Zero- was very impressive, and I suggest those who enjoy well thought out anime should definitely watch it. However, it is a bit melancholic and serious, so for those who enjoy a lighthearted anime, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "I dont usually write reviews for brand new shows, but this one blew my mind. though keep in mind that I have only seen the first episode. but as far as I could tell this is an action packed show that I had to force my self to blink because I didnt want to miss a second of the action.\r\nstory- from the first episode, it follows a group of super natural hunters that go and stop the apparitions from reaking havoc on the town. like I said before this show is almost non stop action that keeps you on the edge of your seat. \r\nArt-the art style was top notch, from the character designs to the backgrounds to the apparitions. the only thing that keeps it from being a ten is that the larger apparitions (B Class) didnt have the best cgi on them, they lacked a bit of detail. But that was mad up for in how cool they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Though there wasnt much of an intro or ending theme to speak of in the first episode, the background music was phenominal and well placed. As well as all of the sound effects, every thing about the sound fit perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- again this is the first episode so they couldnt get too much characterization done, but what they did to was very enjoyable. the main character Touru is torchered by &quot;that man&quot; and wants revenge for the death of his girlfriend. Ill stop there so I dont give away too much but as far as the first episode goes the characters are very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- this is a fantastically done show and look forward to the coming episodes, although there was a huge twist at the end that makes me wonder what will happen... so yeah stop reading this and go watch it!!",

            "content": "Ga-Rei Zero (directed by Ei Aoki of Kara no Kyoukai and Girls Bravo fame), is a prequel to Hajime Segawa's Ga-Rei, a manga in which two teenagers fight evil, may or may not fall in love, and mostly have a good time. Zero was obviously made to introduce more people to the series and get them to read the run-off-the-mill source material, but in the end, it entirely outclasses the manga itself.\r\nThose are my thoughts on the entire Ga-Rei franchise in a nutshell. Like most viewers, I had never heard of the series before this animated prequel aired, but I tried reading some manga chaptersafterwards to be able to put it all into perspective. Ga-Rei Zero starts off with two oddball episodes, designed to get the viewer hooked by means of suspense and gore. Those two didn&rsquo;t turn out to be the show&rsquo;s strongest points however. In the end, it was the for anime unusually convincing drama which makes it jump from the crowd. But let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves and start with&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nThe story (Please note the story only starts come episode 3)\\n\r\nZero takes place two years before the events of the manga. Here, Kagura Tsuchimiya is the heir to a powerful family of exorcists, who do battle with evil spirits and other such nasty supernatural things you don&rsquo;t want to meet in a dark alley, or can&rsquo;t because they wouldn&rsquo;t fit in said alley. Why do they do this? Because it&rsquo;s their duty! Moving on, Kagura moves in with another family of exorcists because her own father doesn&rsquo;t have time to take care of his daughter and there she continues to grow as an exorcist (read: magical girl) with new-found sister Yomi by her side. But, evil has many forms! Dun-dun-duuun.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it&rsquo;s thin, it&rsquo;s standard, it&rsquo;s not Jules Verne (in fact, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like Shakespeare). But what Ga-Rei Zero does well is taking a simple premise which doesn&rsquo;t need explaining (because it&rsquo;s featured in at least 80% of the stories in this little industry) and run from there by covering subjects which the show&rsquo;s biggest inspiration, Sailor Moon, leaves untouched. Zero is, besides a coming-of-age story, really about the bond between two specific characters, placed in an all too familiar (anime-)situation. The twist this show offers includes a lot of doubt, self-resentment and crying. Think of it as Evangelion if you will, though that might be a bit too extreme of an example.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nMain cast &ndash; Kagura and Yomi, that&rsquo;s what Ga-Rei Zero is about. I cannot stretch this enough. So, as one would expect, much time (of 12 episodes) is spent on the development of both main characters and it really, really pays off towards the end. Kagura fulfills the role of the empty shell (the Shinji) who has to deal with all sorts of stuff girls her age shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with, and though she finally makes some decisions near the end, she lets most of the show&rsquo;s events wash over her completely. Which worked rather well, for me at least. One of the most vital aspects to Kagura&rsquo;s personality is actually the extent to which she loves Yomi, and luckily, this is one of the things the creators got absolutely right. You will love Yomi, possibly more than Kagura herself. There&rsquo;s just not a whole lot to hate about her; she&rsquo;s a caring, endearing and beautiful older sister, who is strong in any conceivable way and will always think of her friends first without being a pushover. She&rsquo;s the type of person the viewer can look up to, and that, again, is exactly how Kagura views her. As you can tell, it all comes together neatly. And because of that, it&rsquo;s all the more painful when, well, certain things happen to our beloved duo near the end. Overall, character development on the two main characters is exceptionally well done and many key scenes are very well written. This is definitely the one part which carries the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting cast &ndash;  Good thing the focus is on Yomi and Kagura throughout the series then, because the supporting cast is absolutely laughable. There&rsquo;s a half-naked guy here, with a white afro on his head &aacute;nd on his breast (think village elder from Hare + Guu) who speaks with an American accent and makes weapons out of teapots and refridgerators. There are twins here who both share the same name (Nabuu), have the vocabulary of a caveman, usually finish eachother&rsquo;s sentences and present themselves in third person. It&rsquo;s probably just me, but these are exactly the kind of characters I can&rsquo;t stand, even if they&rsquo;re voiced by Norio Wakamoto himself (the Nabuu brothers are, by the way). Other characters also seem to have been ripped entirely from a show with similar themes, Mai-HiME; a biker girl named Kasuga Natsuki and a certain mysterious, cynical, evil white-haired boy come to mind, but let&rsquo;s not forget the magical girl squad team leader in a wheelchair and her female cohort either. It should be clear that this show doesn&rsquo;t develop its minor characters, simply because it has only 12 episodes to fill. They&rsquo;re a colourful bunch, I&rsquo;ll give them that, but they&rsquo;re absolutely not believable and I literally screamed in agony when the naked guy appeared in one of the most dramatic moments near the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound\\n\r\nAnimation &ndash; Definitely above average. The overall style is a little dark, but so is the story, so no problem there. The scenery is average, some CG won&rsquo;t blend with the surroundings completely and stillscreens are being used a lot near the end, but the animation is almost flawless and everything looks consistent. As for character designs there&rsquo;s once again a huge gap between the main cast and supporting cast; Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s appearances fit their characters spot-on while some other characters could&rsquo;ve looked a little less silly. Then again, because of that, this is definitely not the sort of show where you have trouble telling the characters apart. Monster designs are a little uninspired at times, but the show doesn&rsquo;t go into great depth as to what drives these enemies and where they come from anyway; they&rsquo;re exorcist fodder and their appearance tells us the same thing. Overall though, Ga-Rei Zero is certainly pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound &ndash; Not really omnipresent, but the show definitely contains some carefully constructed tunes to amplify the many moments of both action and drama. Especially in the first two episodes the creators had some fun playing with sound effects and so these are also well done. I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to the OP and ED songs on my iPod, but they&rsquo;re definitely solid and go well with the show, not only because they&rsquo;re sung by Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s voice actors. As mentioned before, Emperor Wakamoto is in this show and so I will have to give &ldquo;sound&rdquo; at least an 8, but the voice-acting overall is pretty solid. The only gripe I have with this aspect of the show may be Kagura&rsquo;s voice, but then again there&rsquo;s not a lot of teenage girls in anime whose voice I do like. Yomi on the other hand is really well done and so is her boyfriend, Noriyuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nPure, old-fashioned enjoyment in this show comes from battle choreography. The fighting in Ga-Rei Zero looks absolutely spectacular; it&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s clever, but also a little&hellip; underdeveloped. Most action anime spend a lot of time talking about strategies, specific moves, they discuss their enemies&rsquo; strengths and weaknesses, they get new moves, etcetera. Zero doesn&rsquo;t have all that. Fights never take too long, either, as opposed to in many a shounen title (let me remind you again Zero only runs for 12 episodes). While some may be glad to hear this, it really has its downsides in that you never know what a character is thinking or trying to do. There are no rules. You just wait until one of two sides has been beaten to a bloody pulp, because before that, nothing is certain. If certain characters from this show would play Counter-Strike, they&rsquo;d be kicked for hacking all the damn time.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it all up\\n\r\nGa-Rei Zero suffers of two things. Firstly, it&rsquo;s made as an advertising prequel to a pretty underwhelming manga series. Why that is a problem will be made painfully obvious to the viewer in episode 12, but I can already you that you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to get satisfactory closure, as the producers want you to read the manga sequel as well. Second, the show only has time to fully develop two characters, which it does a great job at, but there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to the Ga-Rei universe than Zero has a chance of presenting to the viewer (I mentioned the 12 episode limit several times before). The creators shouldn&rsquo;t have had any problem filling up 26 episodes with Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s tale and in case they did, it probably would&rsquo;ve have been one of my favourites of all time. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, tough luck. Even if its drawbacks scare you, Ga-Rei Zero is still one of the best anime all year (2008) and I think despite its heavy focus on human drama, there&rsquo;s still plenty to like here for viewers with varying tastes. Of course, there&rsquo;s only one way to find out if the show suits your tastes and that&rsquo;s just watching it yourself. I hope this wall of text has informed you well, I&rsquo;m giving Zero a rare 9 out of 10 because I&rsquo;m sure these 12 episodes of animation will stay with me for far longer than most.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything you did not like about this review, anything you did like, or anything that just caught your attention for no particular reason, I welcome all feedback on my profile.",

            "content": "One of the better animes I've ever seen. Top notch stuff. Everything about this anime was just really well done. I loved the characters, (even if most of them were portrayed differently from the manga). There was action, there was comedy, and there was sorrow. Everything really was put together beautifully.\r\nStory- Very interesting story. I didn't read the manga so even when I started watching it, it wasn't outrageously hard to understand. I actually didn't know this was a prequel till later, so that's a good sign at how easy the story was to follow.What I have to say about it thought was about howmisleading the first episode was. Not gonna spoil too much, but there's a hot chick on a motorcycle wearing a tight orange jump suit. Mmmmm sexy.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Art was A+ in my book. I've never been big on the realistic look. I've always enjoyed the slightly cartooney and colorful art style, and Ga-Rei -Zero- had that. The fight scenes were great. They were easy to follow, and featured some really bad ass moves. Definitely the type of shounen somebody might like if they enjoyed giant monsters fighting each other and ridiculous fight scenes pulled off by little girls. Gotta see it to believe it, but once again, A+ grade stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Sound was good. Loved the voice actors, they worked really well to pull off the characters emotions.  Sound track fitted the situations nicely and I liked it alot. I'm never to picky with sound, but Ga-Rei -Zero- was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Awesome character development. I really felt for them in their times of peril, anger, and joy. They each fitted into the story nicely, and all played their parts. They had some love going on in their (which I adored cause pairings are what make animes worth watching when people aren't hacking each others heads off), and some slight yuri if you could call it that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Enjoyed this to put it simply. It was fun to watch, I rarely got bored (it had it's slow moments) but they were able to pull through with some gut busting fights. Still nice for those who enjoy the mystery and suspension of wondering what's gonna happen next. It had it's drama, and all in all, it was a really well rounded anime that I think a lot of people could easily enjoy, even if they don't like the whole shounen idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Definitely one of the best animes I've ever seen, like I've said before. It had everything I liked. A little love, drama, action, fanservice. It was awesome. I recommend it for anyone to watch.",

            "content": "My first review so ... here it goes :\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Ga-Rei -Zero- is focused around Tsuchimiya Kagura , Isayama Yomi and a little on the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where they work as exorcists who \" exterminate those who spread the taint of death to the human world \" . You get to see during this anime some interesting and good fights, a slice of Kagura and Yomi&rsquo;s sisters-like life their having with a little touch of shoujo-ai here and there and the conflicts that lead to how the manga&rsquo;s story started ( from what I heard since I have yet to read Ga-Rei) .\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good in my opinion and it&rsquo;s pleasant to watch. The fights are good and very interestingly animated with weapons you don&rsquo;t usually get to see, but here are used as exorcist weapons. Everything looks well in place (even if sometimes the quality is not top notch) fit together to make a good show: characters, creatures, background &hellip; everything. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound &hellip; to be honest I can&rsquo;t really talk a lot here besides the OP that is totally awesome and the ED is good also, and besides this the sound is well fit together with the scenes so I don&rsquo;t recall anything sounding annoying.  So I&rsquo;ll just leave the sound to a good after this being said.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good part of Ga-Rei &ndash;Zero- . There are a lot of interesting supporting characters that fill your episodes with joy and excitement (especially in the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office where most of them are from). The main characters are also interesting and develop well during this anime, you learn a lot about their past and you see them grow emotionally and in terms of fighting power also. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment I can say that I really liked this anime &hellip; interesting fights, weapons, creatures, characters and a catchy opening. Didn&rsquo;t get bored during this anime at all and that&rsquo;s good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a good anime that packs some good action, enjoyable slice of life with a little touch of shoujo-ai and comedy &hellip; and its good for a large variety of viewers and does not disappoint the audience after they finished it.\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers Ahoy!\r\nGa-rei&hellip; where to begin&hellip; Apparently this is based of a manga with the same (or similar title). I have to admit that I was fairly confused by the first episode, which almost never happens to me&hellip; this might be because I never read the original source material. I think, for this one, I&rsquo;ll start with the production value. Overall, the PV was amazing. The animation was fluid and precise, the artwork never suffered many flaws, and the few tiny flaws that it did suffer from are really of no concern. The characters have a decent range of emotional expression, which one really doesn&rsquo;t seemuch these days. The music was good too. It had a bit of a Ghost in the Shell vibe to it, without Yoko Kanno&rsquo;s musical genius. The show did have the tendency to rely on CG a bit heavily, but it was decent CG, and I think it made the Ghost in the Shell vibe even stronger (though production IG wasn&rsquo;t even involved with this.) Ladies and gentlemen, activate the spoiler tags, because here comes the first episode. We learn that the show focuses around a combat squadron that fights against the supernatural. The strongest of these squads is Squad 4, who the story revolves around. We get introduced to the squad, including the bespectacled, fringed commander, his young squeaky girl assistant, Masaki (who I like because he is weird and has glasses, much like myself), this big guy with a scar who said a Buddhist prayer, a girl with a motorcycle that she can kill things with, and the male lead who&rsquo;s name escapes me at the moment. The first scene is our male lead in front of a tombstone in a cemetery, and he has the first of many fucked-up flashbacks for the episode. From here on out, I&rsquo;ll call them FUFB. He see&rsquo;s this creepy kid with white hair, and he is standing over a body and surrounded in flames, then a gunshot is seen, and the male lead snaps back to reality. The motorcycle girl, Natsuki, picks up the male lead to bring him to the scene of a supernatural incident in progress. We first get to see a bunch of invisible zombie things, and they scare me a bit, called Category C, which I guess is low class. Then the main baddy for the show comes in. A Category B&hellip; A ROLLING, FLAMING CG DINOSAUR THAT SHOOTS FLAMING INVISIBLE ZOMBIES! I shit you not, this actually happens. Well, cut a long story short, the incident is solved after some bad-assery in a water plant&hellip; this is where stuff gets kind of fucked up. The lights flicker, and our friends from Squad 4 begin to die&hellip; which kind of weirded me out. Why introduce a bunch of characters if they all die? Well, a girl with a sword kills Masaki, and the other squad four members, pretty violently. The male lead desperately calls base for assistance, and we see that Mami-chan, the assistant to the director, has killed him, and has a face-hugger brain-sucker alien thing on her head&hellip; She speaks as two minds, and says &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be going ahead&rdquo; then shoots herself in the head&hellip; this show seems fucked up, eh? Male lead has another FUFB and sees the white haired child and the body again. The male lead is screaming &ldquo;Aoi&rdquo; which I guess is her name, and the girl with the sword (the one killing everybody) tries to convince him that she is no longer Aoi. Aoi stands up and walks toward male lead. Male lead pleads, Aoi presses against his gun, and he fires. As Aoi falls, a swarm of crystalline blue butterflies (which will most likely be recurring in this show) fly away. We snap back to reality, where the sword girl says &ldquo;I told you to give it up.&rdquo; She then proceeds to slay the male lead. As the credits role, there is no ED, just the almost surprisingly haunting environment noise of falling water. Overall, the show is pretty good, but I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s going on until the next episode. I give this in total an 8/10. The beginning makes it seem like it might be generic, but it was fucked up and confusing enough to hook me in for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by AIC spirits, airs Saturdays.

            "content": "I wasn't going to watch this, I can't remember why, but then one day I did...for some reason...and I'm so glad I did! \r\nI don't think there really is much story...I mean it's like a generic friend story and one friend goes to the dark side and then the light side has to bite the bullet and defeat the dark side and defeat their friend, ya know, Naruto like crap. Queue a shit load of build up trying to make the relationship between the two characters seem more believable and to try and make their final showdown more epic. Not that this series needs itsfights to be anymore epic, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is incredible, it drops a little but never greatly or enough to ruin the show. And the art in the manga is VERY bad so it was nice to see how nice looking this was, with fluid fights (something else the manga lacked). Everything just looked plain awesome. Plus it was nice to see such random weapons, Irons and Suitcases for example (both of which were surprisingly badass).  Plus Yomi is just plain beautiful, I think I'm in love.  \\n\\n\r\nI never really know what to say for sound, yeah the soundtracks great, yeah the voice work is great. Pretty much sums it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite bland, you have a pervert, a gay pervert, a coward, twins, sisters etc etc nothing really pushes the boundaries but all the characters are likeable or funny or hot or use a technique or weapon that makes them badass. You forget how bland they are when they're kicking ass and taking names.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow, someway I feel that 12 episodes was too many, the way they did the intro and outro had  way to much overlap (one episode was basically one of the episodes from the beginning with new bits pushed in the gaps), it could have been broken down into half the episodes, same with the flashback within the flashback that took up most of the series and moved way to slowly, I think their could have been other ways to build up the relationship between Kagura and Yomi and it be enjoyable for us at the same time. This could have easily been 3 - 4 episodes shorter in my book and it woulda made it more enjoyable, you got long, slow boring flashback episodes that didn't really seem to fight juxtaposed with incredible action sequences which did fit. I just wish they wouldn't keep taking their foot off the gas pedal. I feel almost that my time was wasted, there seems to be no plans for a sequel and instead of creating a sorta tied up prequel it was more like an intro into the manga, like a really long advert, I think they coulda done more with the episodes, had their own side story that started at episode one and ended at episode twelve.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall there needs to be more anime like this, the action was incredible, the story was nothing new but it was the Ga-Rei quirks which made it more than just a generic shounen. Sacred Beasts, Irons, Suitcases, twists and turns and characters that actually get their asses handed to them or died. Storywise it followed all the generic shounen patterns but it completely turned it on its head and it should be remembered for that. \\n\\n\r\nIf Bleach was seinen it'd be kinda like this...\\n\\n\r\nI have to make something clear for someone who didn't understand this review. What I liked about this series wasn't so much the content but what the series....stood for. \\n\\n\r\nIt took a rather generic shounen story and turned it on it's head. It was dark and bloody and crazy and shounen is aimed for boys whose balls ain't dropped yet. So for that I take my hat off. Too many shounens limit themselves because of what they're but every now and then a series goes \"FUCK YOU JUMP!\" and does whatever the hell it wants. So yeah the inner flashback was pretty shit. But sometimes it's not just about the content.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ga Rei: Zero\u2019s high octane first episode introduces us to a troupe of interesting characters, filled with spirited action, a dark storyline and\u2026 death. Within twenty-two minutes, it offers a plot twist to shock the viewer.  As a result, the quick pacing is disorienting, foreshadowing a show in love with combat and slacking on story.\r\nGa Rei: Zero is anything but that. From episode two, the narrative takes a decidedly steady stride after forcing our heads underwater. Letting us come up for air, its easy to take in the world. Set in an alternate version of Japan, the government is engaged in a secret warwith the paranormal enlisting the help of exorcists. Being from a family of exorcists herself, Kagura is pulled into the struggle of \u2018good vs. evil\u2019. Now in any other anime this set up would be an excuse for large-scale battles between spirits and their hunters. But Ga Rei: Zero uses it as a frame to focus on the associations of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nCentering on the relationship of the dark-haired Yomi and the younger Kagura, the story seems more slice of life than science fiction, as the two grow to love one another as sisters. At times it appears like the plot is having an identity crisis, focusing on the playful exchanges of the pair before shifting gears into a supernatural skirmish. While jarring at first blush, the writers took effort to weave the two strands together, carefully paving the heroine\u2019s path to a momentous climax.  \\n\\n\r\nMidnight hues evoke a gloom that haunts over the cast. Colors are appropriately muted during moments of tension. These scenes feel almost like watercolors at moments, fluorescent lighting casting a thin haze over the crisp drawings. Serving as the perfect stage, these set pieces host seamless animation, though the action can seem a bit stiff at times when slow motion is used. The only major detractor is the obtrusive CGI, a blending of cell shading and realistic textures, which feels out of place. A glaring example is the gargantuan Kasha beast in the first episode. Its flames look plastic and the edges of grey skin are jagged from poor aliasing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe brisk opening \"Paradise Lost\" by Minori Chihara has a tinge of pessimism while reflecting on the ties of love. It\u2019s pleasant to the ear while tied to the motifs of the Ga Rei: Zero, which is what every OP should do. The ending theme \"Yume no Ashioto ga Kikoeru\" by Mizuhara Kaoru is filled with melancholy, sober when compared to the Chihara\u2019s offering. Both pieces are excellent and are accompanied by an appropriate soundtrack that has a similar sound. The voice acting is done well, Kagura\u2019s innocence perfectly captured while Yomi\u2019s expressions are handled expertly from teasing to tender. Nothing really stands out from the supporting cast except for Mitogawa, the villain, whose innocent tone is both vacant and eerie.\\n\\n\r\nGa Rei: Zero offers the typical shounen tango of heroes and baddies as a young heroine comes to term with the assertive grip of \u2018destiny\u2019. Kagura questions if it\u2019s acceptable to kill the possessed corpses who still look human. The protagonist\u2019s vacillation is the girl\u2019s tragic flaw that inevitably leads her to the footsteps of the stunning conclusion. Admirably maturing Kagura through the twelve episodes from vulnerability to independence, Ga Rei: Zero executes an effective coming of age tale.\\n\\n\r\nYomi acts as a foil to Kagura\u2019s growth. As the story progresses, she becomes less and less grounded in reality. It\u2019s disheartening to watch her mentally unravel, her transformation is perversely beautiful as the once a supportive guide becomes the antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the supporting characters are an expendable commodity in this production. The audience is introduced to a whole platoon of faces, from those in the Minstry of Defense, to those in the Agency. The program has no shame, liberally murdering likable persona throughout the installments.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a simple formula of mixing Ghostbusters, Men In Black, and a bit of high school drama, Ga Rei became a wildly popular manga in Japan. Ga Rei: Zero serves as a prequel to the drawn word, focusing on the relationship of Kagura and her adoptive sister Yomi. Narratives of this nature raise a few questions: Is it accessible to those who are not familiar with franchise? If so, does the program offer anything to those foreign to the series?\\n\\n\r\nThe answer to both is an emphatic yes. Ga Rei: Zero serves a powerful story, wrought with impact, memorable characters and excellent production value. Not only does it reinforce the happenings of the main storyline, it seduces you into the dark embrace of Kagura\u2019s world, imploring that you give the manga at least a passing glance.",

Ga Rei Zero exceeded my expectations, and I definitelyyy am going to be reading the manga for it too after watching this anime.\r\nIt's been awhile since I felt like I found an anime I enjoyed an anime this much. Ga Rei Zero's description here on Myanimelist is quite brief, and it really doesn't tell you very much about the show, so you have to watch it to really find out what it's about. And it's actually quite fitting for this particular anime, because this anime tells has such anamazing storyline that you really have to give it a watch because simplifying this anime into a short summary would just make it sound much more bland than it really is. This anime is definitelyyyy worth giving it a shot. I was intrigued after episode 1, interested enough by episode 2 to want to continue to episode 3, and by episode 3 I was thoroughly captivated in Ga Rei Zero.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ga-Rei:Zero\r\n\"Will you kill someone you love, because of love?\" just seeing the tagline used in the anime, Ga-Rei definitely caught my attention, and it REALLY suit the anime. I was like WOW. Just from the tagline you can know what the main conflict will be. Despite that you will still feel eager to watch each episode.\r\nI gave this anime a 10 cause basically, I loved everything about it. From the pilot episode until the ending episode, I had my eyes glued on the screen, sitting at the edge of my chair, anxious about the what will happen in the next episode. I actually watched thisin one sitting cause I can't wait as to what will happen next. I even finished watching it at like 2 in the morning even though I have class that day ^^\\n\\n\r\nFrom my perspective, Ga:Rei's plot is its strongest point. It is something you don't see too often. Amongst few animes I have watched, Ga:Rei does not have any similarities in comparison to their plot.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked how they developed the way the anime starts and end. The pilot episode is something that really caught my interest. For me, the pilot and ending episode are the most important factor of the anime. This is for the reason that the first and last episodes are the episodes that leaves impression to the viewers. And Ga:Rei did not fail in both. Ga:Rei started the episode introducing the main and major conflict in the story (which, did I mention, is REALLY interesting, and did not really introduce the main characters 'till midway) and then flashes back on how the conflict started. The ending episode covers some of the scenes of the pilot episode, and it was an epic ending (though bittersweet). Action scenes are quite good too. I especially liked the scenes where Nori and Yomi are all love-love and L.Q. ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also great. I liked how the characters' personality changed because something inevitable happened. Any way I like their personality. I can't really point out what I liked about them. I just do^^\\n\\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\n*I really recommend this anime. You won't regret watching it. At first you might be saying to yourself \"oh, another supernatural anime, etc\" it does not actually quiet focus on it but focuses more on the bonds the characters have to the people surrounding them. Really nice anime, I even bought a DVD after watching it for free at some anime site ^^",

            "content": "When I started watchin Ga-Rei Zero, I never thought I would enjoy it so much. If in the beggining of the first episode I was surprised to see how full of action it was, at the end of the same episode I was like \"what the hell.. everybody dies. anime ends. go home\". (If you watched it you know what I'm taking about). And then in the second episode other characters die so I was kind of confused and said to myself \"No, no. Something is wrong here\". Well, the actual story starts with episode 3 so basically, the first 2 episodes have nothing todo with the rest of the series. I know it is weird but in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the storyline, I have to say it's pretty amazing. The two main characters, Yomi and Kagura, show us that the most important thing in the world is not family itself, but the persons who are not blood-related to you and still love you like they truly are. It's a sad story indeed, about friendship, family bonds, love and loyalty. Like many other animes, this one theaches us that with great power comes great sacrifice and unless you are emotionally strong you can't live the way Yomi and Kagura did.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is awesome! Those sad and peaceful melodies which play in the background of the most heartbreaking scenes are completely wonderful. I haven't seen an anime with such an appropriate music since a while. Moreover, given the powerful beginning with countinuous action I would've never thought the anime could be so sensitive.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character was Yomi. Although she turned into a villain, she died as hero, as a good person who only wished to protect the ones she loved. Yomi was (in my opinion) the most complex character of the series. She loved Kagura like her little sister, she loved her adoptive father like her real one and nevertheless, she loved noriyuki so much that she couldn't kill him. In spite of the fact that she was such a hearty person, the rest of the family hated her for not being blood-related to them (which I find incredibly hard to live with). I don't blame her for wanting revenge or for holding hatred against May and her uncle (whom she killed) and I definately don't blame her for wanting power after she ended up crippled. You know that saying: \"You weren't born evil. Life made you this way\". I think this pretty much sums up Yomi's life. Anyway, I was glad to see that in the end she let go of the hatred and realised there were still persons who cared about her. Too bad it was too late.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was full of unexpected but the fact that so many people had to die really saddened me. Their deaths were sooo sorrowful, they really got to my feels. What I liked most was how this uninterrupted action was combined in such a fine way with a remarkable life story and of course, unfulfilled love. There are 3 different things wrapped into a singel package. And this package is surprisingly good.",

            "content": "~~~~~~~~SPOILERS~~~~~~~\r\n***first \"review\" I've ever done.\r\nAs I write this review I have currently just finished that last episode aired for this anime which would be episode 12 and I have some things I'd like to say about Ga-Rei Zero, both how I felt about the journey through it and how I think it fairs as an anime as a whole (they are different).\r\nDo you enjoy action?\r\nDo you enjoy light romance?\r\nDo you enjoy a tear jerking experience?\r\nIf you said yes to any of the above this is a MUST watch!\r\nMAIN CONTENT (LESS GIBBERISH) SPOILER FREE!\r\nGa-Rei Zero is about two girls who work for a organization that fightsagainst the supernatural/ghosts, monsters and all the sorts is what you can guess from reading the synopsis, is that all it has to offer? if you think surely not then you would be correct, Ga-Rei Zero is not so much about monster fighting at all its much more about the relationships between two girls Yomi and Kagura who both find each other by fate and connect because of there experiences and the past, it helps them to understand each other in which  they become unofficial sisters and go through life working for this organization, but if you read the synopsis something goes horribly wrong in one of there missions, I can't go much more into detail unless I want to spoil things important so if you wish to read more and don't care about spoilers read more below! \\n\\n\r\nSCORES\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 - The story as I'm sure you already know isn't very unique in the idea of main characters killing monsters and the supernatural but I'm giving it a 8/10 because it was done fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 - To me personally the art was great, it was dark yet colourful enough for the watcher to understand how the creators wanted you to portray the setting and atmosphere, the characters were well done so I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - Nothing to special, the sound did it's job in instilling emotions and giving you an idea of situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 -  I scored enjoyment fairly low because the ending wasn't what I was hoping for (it felt like something was missing) which REALLY bummed me out if you want to read the ending feel free to read my comments below.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 - If you are looking for a tear jerking experience with tonnes of action and well fleshed out main characters then look no further then Ga-Rei Zero which offers that and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL THOUGHTS OF GA-REI ZERO (GIBBERISH) SPOILERS!\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to cover how I personally felt about my experience with Ga-Rei Zero first, this anime to me is fantastic on so many levels. just everything about it seems like it clicks in my mind as something I would watch from animations to plot/story to character development, for example how Kagura is taken in from Yomi's family and how they connect and become as close as you can get to blood related sisters, I feel not to many animes any more focus on relationships but Ga-Rei Zero nails it. ~SPOILER~ BUT on a personal enjoyment level the ending where Kagura kills Yomi to stop her suffering from a bane stone she was tricked into using almost causing her to turn into a phantom,~SPOILER~  it just feels empty like the anime is missing something, to be honest I doubt any of this will make any sense since I am still in shock to what I have witnessed, I really wish there was a season 2 of this anime because at the end it time skips 2 years after Kagura kills Yomi and we see Kagura with a boy named Ken whom we can only assume is her boyfriend or colleague fighting off more spirits which hints at a season 2 but to this day it hasn't been made, another thing that hints at a season 2 is it never really shows us Yomi is dead for sure, ya she got stabbed but since she has a bane stone a single stab wouldn't do her in so it makes me think Yomi is alive somewhere, this anime SCREAMS season 2 but it's not yet here hopefully it is one day.\\n",

            "content": "After I saw the overall score, and red some of the reviews at the end of the anime my soul was screamin \"and this is it?\", no like seriously that was it? So to summarize story, Kagura (a girl who shouts only \"Yomi/demo/sonna\") is a best friend and a sister wannabe off Yomi(a mediocre orphan written character) and because Yomi is in her teen age (probably that is the only thinkable reason) she will get brainwashed into thinking that it's NOT ok to feel hatred against someone who killed her father manipulated everybody to hate and abandon her by using a some stone which turnyou into evil person, and because she is an exorcist she will kill her(which is ok, but nobody gets it), and so Yomi will feel abandoned because nobody but her close frends believes her and she will do exactly the same as the person she killed.... AND THATS IT, yes thats it, and not to mention that 70% of the story is a flashback so you know right at the start how the story will progress. So you are just waiting for something to hapen..but it wont. I feel really dissapointed. Not because the story was promising at the start, or because of unique storytelling or character design...oh hell no. I am dissapointed because my expectations were set much higher then usualy would be and that is because of ridiculously overrated score this anime has.\\n\\n\r\nOh I am so angry, I wont even read my rewiew again for typos!\\n\r\nHave a good night!!!",

            "content": "Ga-Rei Zero caught my attention while browsing a forum. To be more accurate it was a character named Yomi. The motto of the show \u201cWill you kill someone you love because of love?\u201d seemed interesting and makes you wonder about the series.\r\nThe show starts basically with the ending. We don't get any introductions we just arrive in the middle of the action. The whole first episode is raced through the events, and it got a sudden and suprising end. At the beginning of the second episode the whole pace changes, and we return to the events that happened years before the first episode. After thisthe show basically turns into a slice of life show with few bits of drama and pretty much cominc relief elements.\\n\\n\r\nWe get see the main characters relationships to each other and their motives explained. There are some action scenes in-between, but they don't become important to the main story until the end. The last few episodesw pick the pace up again and show us the events that eventually led to episode one. \\n\\n\r\nNow few words about the ending. After all this build-up, you wait for a a climatic, atcion-packed conclusion and you might think everything gets explained and resolved. Wrong. You get the action and you understand the motives of the main characters, but it is so rushed and meaningless, that barely feels like an ending. The anime was a prequel to the manga series, so it is a bit understandable, that not everything is wrapped up, but there are so many unexplained elements to the story, that I had to look after the answers to my questions at more places.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episodes introduces dramatic changes in the story that felt rushed and they came basically out of the blue. I think they are supposed to have a dramatic effect on the viewer, however they only raise more questions instead. While the ending is dramatic, the monologues of the side characters ruin the mood and while these scenes are supposed to show the inner thoughts of the main characters, while they are explained through the viewpoint of the supporting cast. This distances the viewer from the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are colorful we can see many types of people appearing in the first episode. Too bad, that the supporting cast takes too much focus from the main characters, Kagura and Yomi. This wouldn't be bad if they played important part in the events. Sadly in the end the majority of the supporting characters only serve as cannon fodder to the demons and don't even play any role to the development of the story, save for a few exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nYomi is the one character who bears the whole show on her shoulders. She sets events in motion, her character is pretty unique and she has the most focus throughout the story, while the other characters are static. Her development is the only worth mentioning altough her actions may seem inconsequent due to the poor storytelling. But if there is one character you might get attached to during the that is undoubtly Yomi. Kagura, the other main character of the show is young girl who joins Yomi in her job as an exorcist at a very young age. She has a naive and kind nature, and this remains so during the events. She faces many hardships despite her young age, but the sad thing is, it doesn't even change a bit of her personality. At the end of the show, the flash-forward shows, that her personality hasn't gone through any changes at all, rendering the previous events almost meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nI personally feel, that the show could have been much better if the story would only be about Kagura and Yomi. While they get much screentime, too much of it goes by without any meaningful events, and this gives back the feeling of a slice-of-life show. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the action scenes are the major strong-points of the show. The fights are well animated, the motions are fluid, the scenery is also nice. The sound effects and the music is pretty mediocre, it is not really worth mentioning. The opening song is very catchy, it goes well with the action scenes of the show and the slow ending matches the mood of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show totally ruins the mood of the anime. I only can recommend the series to people who like action shows and are prone to tear-jerkers. For those, who look for a more time, Ga-Rei is certainly not their choice.",

            "content": "While reading the manga, I found out that there was going to be an anime called Ga-Rei Zero. They said it had nothing to do with the manga except the settings. I'm like \"I love the manga, How about I give this show a try\". I watched all of it and this is one of the best anime shows I've ever seen.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI never knew this show was going to be a prequel of Ga-Rei. The creators of the show never said this was going to be a prequel. After I watched Episode 1, I was shocked at what they did with the main characters.They immediately killed all of the characters. I'm liked \"Are these guys digging their own grave? What are they going to do now\". I was planning to give up on the show but I decided to watch Episode 2 to see what they're doing now. Thank God, I never left the show. After watching Episode 2-12, I was amazed at the story of this show. It was somewhat more superior than the manga itself. I also never felt like Episode 2-12 was a filler. I felt they were significant to the story. Story synopsis is there for you so I'm not going to summarize the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation was awesome. It didn't get a perfect score because it had it's few flaws but those flaws aren't really that significant. Even the design of the Spirit Beasts was awesome\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack was amazing.. Especially the opening soundtrack. Whoever composed the soundtrack, prop to you. Soundtrack gave me goosebumps on some episodes. Again, it has flaws but not that significant. The soundtrack between Kagura and Yomi's final fight scene was also emotional. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters were well designed and well developed. Each character had their own likable personality. You have Kagura, the protagonist of the show and a girl who always smiles. She's Yomi's step sister. You have Yomi, also the protagonist of the show and later becomes the antagonist of the show. She adopted Kagura after Kagura's mother died. These girls are step-sisters but their sister bond relationship make it look like they're actually real sisters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show. I never got bored of a single episode and I managed to watch the whole season in a day. The fighting scenes were awesome and it felt like I wanted more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show is truly a masterpiece... Great story, great character development, Great soundtrack and it made you want more after watching the Final episode. Note that this is a prequel to the manga series Ga-Rei. Unless you've read the manga, you won't understand part of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great story\\n\r\n-Great character development\\n\r\n-Lovable characters\\n\r\n-Great soundtrack\\n\r\n-Makes you want more episodes\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I LOVE this show. LOVE. this show. For the past couple of weeks I have been watching a bunch of anime, looking for one that would be as good as my past favorites, but after watching about four different, and highly rated, anime series, I was left feeling dissapointed and unsatisfied. I felt like I was losing my faith in anime. But then, I stumbled upon this anime while scrolling down the homepage of this site, and two episodes in I was captivated. \r\nI tend to have very high expectations when watching anime, and I am proud to say that Ga-Rei Zero has fulfilled manyof them. \\n\\n\r\nThe story's interesting. I haven't seen many shows about exorcizing demons so others might feel differently. The plot's nothing new, but I think they succeeded in doing the best they could with what they had.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, art is one of the most critical aspect of a good anime. and I'm proud to say that Ga-Rei Zero blew me away. Their style of art is just the way I like it. The characters were attractive and detailed. The special effects were stunning, especially the epic battle sequences. The only irk I had was that the characters have this extra line at the bottle of their lip. I'm just not used to seeing that, but otherwise everything else was perfect. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was excellent, very suiting. The opening and ending songs kick ass, really put you in the mood, if you know what I mean. Also, the songs they played during the show are perfectly timed and really enhanced some sequences. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in Ga-Rei Zero is flawless, especially between the two main characters. Although I would've liked to see more between yomi and another certain man :) hehehe...Anyways, I think one of the strongest points in Ga-Rei Zero is their characters. I did harbor a deep, deep and real hatred for a certain character, but that only shows how good the characterization is. \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I  really, really enjoyed this series. The ending, although heart wrenching, is fully satisfying. This anime is action packed, dramatic, thrilling, funny at times, and UNPREDICTABLE, and SUSPENSEFUL. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point is how it leads viewers to assume things. All I have to say is...wait for it. I promise you will be as shocked as I was. Those brilliant and impeccably timed plot twists really did it for me. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is merely 12 episodes long and won't be having a second season. But for the first time ever, I'm actually okay with it. The ending was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThank you, Ga-Rei Zero, for rekindling my love for anime. This isn't good bye, though, because I will be rewatching you over and over again.",

            "content": "Ga Rei Zero?\r\nHmmmm.....\r\nI found it accidentally while searching for best anime titles of 2008. Animecrazy.net included it into their list. Hmmm....Kinda intriguing coz the poster seemed so interesting...time to see some shounen moves again...it's blazing!!!\r\n(Well, you could easily find this poster that I'm talking about. The one, with many characters surrounded with fire, you'll find it)\r\nUnfortunately, the people in the poster doesn't have anything to do with the whooooooooooooooleeeeeeeeeeeeeeee anime.....Hmmm...well, not really. You see, I thought I would be facing them longer and have to deal with some 10 maybe 20 lousy minutes and more to come, but I was soooooooooooooooo surprised that they wereeasily BUTCHERED!!! MY gosh! This ANIME boasts in B-L-O-O-D! And to think that these people in the poster were the main characters,,,HUH? What would happen now in the story????? AHEMMMM.... I was confused for a while. I paused while seeing the credits at the end, waiting for the ed song to play..but nothing showed up? What's wrong with this anime????\\n\\n\r\nEHERM>....Now we're faced with another set of characters. They possess powers like what- I-thought-to-be-the main-characters also have, like they can see beasts or dark spirits what an ordinary person cannot do. As you see, these characters work under the government to destroy these malevolent spirits and help to maintain peace on earth. These were chosen people who have certain gifts and abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them. See, nothing extra- ordinary right? Well, it's the re-usable plot of any action anime.\\n\\n\r\nDe mo.....Don't lose hope...\\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned earlier, the what- I-thought-to-be-the main-characters were BUTCHERED right from the very beginning. So, this may seem something new and intriguing, right?.....BWAGAGAGAGA!!!\\n\\n\r\nWill you kill someone you love, because of love? Ahemmm....Kinda soft and romantic right? It doesn't seem right for a bloody anime like this, I thought. You see, This anime is lead by a female named Kagura Tsuchimiya who idolized her Yomi-oneechan. And Yomi-oneechan, true enough, is a very skilled swordsman and a prodigy in the making. She was set to be a heir to her fostered-clan and had a very cute love-hate relationship with her fiancee, Nori-chan. Romantic, it is! They even had a filler episode just for the two, Yay!! If you're into this kind of genre, action with romance inside, then this one is really for you!! Hek hek ^_^\\n\\n\r\nAll seems right and fine, until, of course, the dark side made his entrance. This source-of-trouble which made the goody-goody relationship of everyone turned to its worst situation and gave a 360 degree rotation to all the lives of our dear characters..HUHUHUHUHUHUHU!! ^~^\\n\\n\r\nBecause, you know there's a lot of things that were really regrettable and as a viewer you could not help to feel so remorsed for the things that could have saved: relationships with your co-workers, relatives, friends, love life (huhuhuhu, so much regret ^~^) and with your treasured one. Huhuhuhu :(\\n\\n\r\nAnd to think, that this whole thing is just a prequel to the original story.....MY GOLLY!! Although, I'm gonna say that the 12 episodes kinda satisfied me, and I feel fine even if there wont be any continuation to the story, the thought of the real plot keeps me more interested. Real main characters will be revealed. Wushu!!! I haven't searched for any season 2 yet, if their on the making already. But, Whatevah!! Sure they will, it's not like they kinda use the setting of the manga only and wont deliver the real fruit. 'Couse, they wont. Bring it on!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\\n\r\nI like the Paradise Lost (OP song)\\n\r\nNori-chan! Yomi-chan!! Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuuuh\\n\r\n:",

This was one of the highlights of the show, and definitely was a solid good plot backing it up. It engages the viewer not to drop the show and it was sure to please even the viewers who are not a fan of the genre. I know this since I am definitely not a huge fan of action shows, and I absolutely loved GRZ. The twists and turns of the plot was exceptional, and was entertaining but definitely kept you at the edge of your seat until the very end of theshow. However, the ending for me was not very good, but I\u2019ll let you judge that yourself ;)\\n\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\r\n\u201cSolid and good plot that was very entertaining and would keep viewers from watching. A deep storyline with lots of twists in it. If it wasn\u2019t for the ending, I would have given it a full 10.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nWow. Very exceptional designs. I absolutely adored the character designs. Not to mention the kick-ass animation that the producers did. I have no comments for this one, all I can say is that it is brilliant. Heck, even a Mio (K-On) lookalike is there!\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\r\n\u201cNothing else to say but brilliant. Not just the character designs, but the smooth and awesome animations.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed GRZ. The characters were loveable, I truly loved all of them! :3 Nabuu FTW! The first 2 episodes definitely were the most memorable for me and was the reason I kept watching. GRZ has a little bit something for everyone, definitely.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\r\n\u201cAn enjoyable show to watch. Definitely won\u2019t get bored of it, that\u2019s for sure ^^\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 29/30\\n\r\nGRZ is definitely a must watch anime. Trust me, YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT. At first, I hated Ga-Rei Zero before even watching it! You know why? Cause I thought that the name was horrible XD. But little did I know that this show was exceptional and I know that I would have regretted not watching it. That just goes to show that you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by it\u2019s cover (in this case, not to judge an anime by its name XD). Definitely recommended for everyone, even those who aren\u2019t fans of the genre.\\n\r\n\u201cSolid and good plot that was very entertaining and would keep viewers from watching. A deep storyline with lots of twists in it. If it wasn\u2019t for the ending, I would have given it a full 10.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "I saw some pics of Ga-Rei Zero tonight and rember what a good anime it is. I heard about it in a forum and my firts thouts were \"Oh, well I run out of any good animes with little episodes, why not to watch this one, it is not much of an deal anyway\". But then I didn't know that that's not another lazy, boring anime with fights here and there. At start I was a bit confused with the story and the first 1-3 eps but when the main story take place I was shocked. This fascinating, complex and still interesting story revolving aroundtwo friends and the human soul which can not overcome some things.\\n\r\nI think the 12 episodes where too little for a story like this. \t\\n\r\nBut this can certainly be forgiven because all the attention may finally be concentrated in Kagura and Yomi. Dynamics around them, comedy, action, the bond between them that would strengthened with each passing episode and then simply merge with nothing and only the memory remains. The whole anime is a good example of what can be done only by one or even innocent-looking, human mistake and how fragile is the relationship between two people.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Art all that I didn't like were the \"invisable\" demons. However the main characters were beatiful and the battles - very well made.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a good thing that the OP and ED had comed around 3 ep and didn't show right from the begining the main characters. The music during the battles wasn't bad too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ga-Rei Zero is a nice anime, with good sense and insight into human life and emotions, with not that little action and comedy too. Definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "I think the first episode ending was a wonderful hook.  The second episode drew you in more.  But Ga-Rei Zero, despite strong action scenes, and great leads fails, and really, fails utterly because it doesn't remain true to it's characters.  \r\nAs the back story develops after episode 2 the bond between Yomi and Kagura receives a full accounting, and it is the rather well developed main characters and wonderful interaction between them and also the members of their team that made these several episodes captivating.  I was less impressed throughout the story with the monster designs and I found all theClan family heads less than believable - they were there for the plot`s sake.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens to Yomi, to make her change?  The drastic change, I assumed, was akin to being turned into a vampire - that is, the evil Yomi was possessed, so she was not responsible for her actions.  When the Bane stone, a rather poorly defined object of `pure supernatural energy`makes it appearance I guessed it had something to do with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo Yomi, the adopted, loved, in love, daughter of a powerful clan head, a loyal, honored member of an organization that battles those who would release the `foulness of death`upon the world then has a very bad day. And before she is turned to the dark side, she commits an act completely out of character, she kills someone.  (This scene has another thing wrong with it - the person she kills, had just escaped the thralls of the Bane stone, but seemingly lost all memory of it, yet earlier when this had happened to her she was in shock because of her actions.)  Yomi would not have done this act.  \\n\\n\r\nSigh, but she did, and then the primary antagonist (PA) shows up and the next thing you know she`s in a coma for 2 months, suspected of heinous crimes, and when she wakes up, probably permanently physically disabled, seemingly doubted by her (ex)-fiancee and Kagura (who both commit actions I found highly unlikely that upset Yomi).  So she`s alone and lo and behold, the PA agains shows up, heals her ailing body with the bane stone offers it to her and sigh, she takes it.  The Yomi I had come to know would have been filled with remorse at her killing someone, she would have used some very nasty Japanese words, the PA would have left her, a broken proud warrior.  \\n\\n\r\nBut the screenwriter probably had the ending in mine when he started writing this series, but fell in love with Yomi while creating the character, and made her much more.  \\n\\n\r\nBut if the Bane stone can take possession of your soul, and force you to commit evil acts, which it seemingly does, when sigh Yomi has become evil, there are really only 2 possible choices for the story.  Either Yomi has the ability to overcome the lurid presence of the Bane Stone, and the focus should be on her internal conflict using her powerful will to at least have a chance at redemption (which still might have included her sacrificing herself).  Both drama and tragedy can come out of this - it is a good choice but melodrama won out.  Additionally, this could have been Kagura battling the `banality of evil`` that Yomi had become but also, you know, trying to get that glowing stone out of her and maybe big sis would come back!  But melodrama won out.",

            "content": "\u201cWould you kill someone you love, because of love?\u201d\r\nThe allure of psychological tragedy is undeniable. From the moment I read taglines, the rational side of my mind calls a bluff. Moral challengers are a rare godsend, but something about morally-challenging, interesting taglines triggers skepticism, like they exist to compensate for said moral challenge to be little more than a brief tangent to the circle called the plot. So, with the above skepticism in hand, Ga Rei \u2013Zero- became my next target, hoping that it would exceed my (admittedly unjustly low) expectations. \r\nWhat I did not expect was the single most emotional, beautiful pieces of tragedyI have happened across in an anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBeing a relative novice with the supernatural genre, I approached \u201cGa Rei \u2013Zero-\u201c with an open mind, expecting something akin to \u201cElfen Lied\u201d in its exploration of the concept of love, and indeed, my assessment ultimately proved correct. Not knowing the original Ga Rei continuity, my first impressions of \u2013Zero- were those of apprehension: series driven by squad dynamics rely heavily on interaction rather than depth of character, and given the psychological appeal of this series and the highly personal nature of the series\u2019 driving value, I wondered if I should resign this series to a mere pass-time. It was at that pivotal moment where the real story arrived on the scene in a katana-fuelled frenzy, instilling me with such profound shock that my impressions of the series instantly turned about.\\n\\n\r\nHaving been fed the ways of Aristotlean theatre for the better part of a year, my interest was piqued by an apparent subversion of the ways of tragedy. Yet in this exploration of the tragic heroine corrupted by something so noble as love, I found something in this series which invoked the same catharsis one is meant to find. This is, perhaps, the triumph of this production: many a series fails because their main character is impossible to sympathize with, or is so derivative that sympathy becomes impossible. Yet as I held the naive belief that the tragic heroine could be saved, salvaged by the eternal bonds of sisterly love, I realized just how profound an effect the series had on me: just how well the series endeared me to its characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs one need not guess at the ending to a prequel, it falls to the director to end the series in a fashion that does the viewer justice, yet engage those who are oblivious to the nature of the bitter end with a sense of apprehension, the \u201cwhat next\u201d sense one ought to feel. But as the tragically beautiful music swelled to a climax and falls with the hero\u2019s last words, despite the part of my mind suited to analyse form from a cool distance, the part which knew this was inevitable for this tragic heroine fell silent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, despite the silent beauty of the scene, somehow I felt unsatisfied. In spite of the beauty, the music, the raw emotion, and its undeniably profound effect on me, something about that scene felt inconclusive, something nagging at my mind. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be it. There has to be something more.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the downfall of this series is that is a prequel, and, while as a stand-alone text its mastery is evident, its effect cannot be felt segregated from its parent material. While in its own, Ga Rei \u2013Zero- is more than beautiful, easily able to take the highest mantle for tragedy and, perhaps, the mantle for anime in general, my final conclusion is that for the profound catharsis effect demanded of tragedy, one simply cannot approach this like a casual observer.\\n\r\nAnd hence, the onus is on the audience to do the series justice. While even the most callous of us cannot deny they feel for the plight of the characters, in the end, the series\u2019 ability to make one care for the characters is undeniable. But it\u2019s the difference between greeting a new acquaintance and an old friend. It\u2019s obvious which has the better effect.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say Ga Rei \u2013Zero- is worthless alone. Far from it, as an exploration of love, loss and hate, it\u2019s nothing less than brilliant. To pick up this ball and run with it is a definite worthwhile experience, but if you\u2019re serious about playing the game, invest the time and read the manga first.\\n",

Emotions wereespecially strong towards the end. My favourite piece of music was the insert song, \"Reincarnation\" by Yozuca and Faylan, played during the last episode which drawn me close to tears(i don't cry easily) when paired with the ending scenes of the final fight. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a short anime of 12-13 episodes to watch, i will strongly recommend Ga Rei:Zero, one of the best short anime i watched.",

I enjoy seeing animes that try to change it up and try something different.\\n\\n\r\nSound-It has a really soothing and appropriate opening to it and the music always seems to match the intensity.Not really much to say the soundtrack was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-The 2 main characters are alot alike in most ways, they are sisters afterall.Yet there extremely diverse.You also got the nabuu brothers which are you typical block head muscle types, but they feel different that the rest because they are brothers and there smarter than they appear.The sort of secondary characters even have small backstories to them so you might even remember some of them which isnt all that common in animes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-At first i was a little bit annoyed with this anime because it seemed to go all over the place, but it was actually giving a really in depth back story that led to a tragic ending which after finishing the anime made me realize how well written this anime was. This anime is filled with tons of awesome fighting, comedy here and there which one scene in particular makes me laugh everytime i think of it, and of course the intense moments and sad parts that seem to stick with you. They still do and its been a month or so since ive seen this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-Overall this anime can be confusing at first like some animes can, but you realize that its just cleverly written. Once i figured that out i really got to enjoy it. It has tons of action, funny scenes and intense scenes which seem to balance out in my opinion. If you like tragic, intense fighting animes then i think you would enjoy this.",

            "content": "After watching the first couple of episodes of Ga-Rei -Zero-, I came an inch away from just dropping it altogether, but since the fall season didn't have much else that interested me I stuck with it.  About 4 episodes later I was really glad that I did stick with it.  By the end of the season, this actually made my favorites list.\r\nGa-Rei -Zero- does an excellent job of character development for Yomi and Kagura.  In fact, it does such a good job it almost completely ignores most of the other characters, which was the one thing I wish was better.\r\nThe artwork inthe show is very clean, though dark (which was in line with the story so I have no complaints).  The fights were dynamic and very well done, though some of the weapons and fighting were kind of &quot;out there.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was nothing amazing to me, but it did well enough at setting the feeling from what I recall feeling while watching each episode.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the story.  There isn't a whole lot to say about it, because this is simply a precursor to the main storyline that exists in the manga.  That being said, I thought that it was really very well done, giving us a background on the characters that we would need to know and setting up the general premise for the content.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in a nutshell, I really, really liked this series.  It had some cool action, some great character development, and didn't try to stretch the content.  Ga-Rei -Zero- is possibly the best pre-cursor to an existing storyline that I have seen, and one that I would easily recommend to anyone that enjoys this genre of show.",

I know there was a manga before this and Ga-Rei: Zero is the prequel for it, but you do not need the basic knowledge of the manga to understand this prequel. It could definitely stand on its own. If you are not into bloody and gruesome animes, I suggest you stay from this unless you are willing to take the risk. There is subtle nudity, but it's nothing bad.\r\nThe story is about the bond betweentwo school girls (Yomi Isayama and Kagura Tsuchimiya) who are destined to become vanquishers, people who eliminate phantoms who disturb the balance in the living world. Ga-Rei: Zero has exciting, thrilling fighting scenes; The animation looks amazing. The English dub is pretty excellent; one of the best I've heard. This series is fast-paced and head-boggling. The characters are believable and their motives are not questionable. When the past of the main characters are explained, the characters become almost real and deep. I enjoyed Ga-Rei: Zero the whole way through. If you love strong female leads and you don't mind a little gruesome fighting, you'll love it. This anime truly expresses what it means to love somebody.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I believe this is one anime you can't put on hold. It's a great way to spend a lonely Saturday night.",

            "content": "Going into Ga-Rei-Zero I didn't really know what to expect. All I had really heard about it was that it was an urban fantasy action series directed by a Mr. Ei Aoki, whom previous to this, had only directed...Girls Bravo? However, after Ga-Rei-Zero he went on to direct Wandering Son (which I think is brilliant), the first Kara no Kyoukai film, Fate/Zero, and most recently, a show I recommend everyone go check out called Aldnoah.Zero. I consider Ga-Rei-Zero as Ei Aoki's first attempt at Fate/Zero. Ga-Rei-Zero is a good show. But it's obviously not on any level close to Fate/Zero. It has many good qualitiesabout it, and now, I'm gonna go over those good qualities! \u00a0 \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe story is about vanquishers who are essentially spirit detectives who try to keep these ghosts from terrorizing their city. The story holds up, but comes off as pretty confusing at times. This series is a prequel to the manga that it was adapted from.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10 \\n\r\nI thought the characters were portrayed very well. A few character motivations weren't entirely made clear but that's alright. Yomi and Kagura's relationship is one of the best that I've seen from two female characters. A sisterly bond unique to this show that separates it from many other anime.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is above average for its time (2009). Action scenes looked really good, and the character designs were good. Ga-Rei-Zero was animated in part by Asread and AIC Spirits. Asread has recently worked on the Corpse Party adaptation and the ever polarizing Mirai Nikki.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nI thought the soundtrack was fantastic. Each track played throughout the show is just great. Whether it's during an action scene or not, the music just fits perfectly. The opening and ending themes were great. They both really pump you up and make you want to continue watching. In terms of voice acting, I'll recommend the Japanese Dub over the English Dub for this one. It's one of \"those\" FUNimation dubs where they use those same 10 people that they always used to use to voice each character. Nothing really wrong with the English dub but it's average at best. \u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/FINAL THOUGHTS: 7/10\\n\r\nGa-Rei-Zero is a good show. It has many good action sequences, great character interactions, and a fantastic soundtrack. Some confusing plot lines but they can be overlooked. I was told that this show had a really good first episode, and I was not disappointed. It's really intense, and it'll really grab your attention. I will say that I really dislike how they ended this series. You can't end a show like that if your not gonna make a second season. It seems unlikely that another season will be made, as it was made 5 years ago, and we've heard nothing since. I recommend this show to you if your in the mood for a good action series with a great soundtrack and a great bond between female characters. I will also recommend the currently airing Tokyo ESP, which was written by the same mangeka and takes place in the same universe as Ga-Rei-Zero.\\n\r\nSee ya !\\n\\n",

I won't recommend this to people who know that they are not very smart either, because the message behind the story is quite deep.\r\n\"Will You Kill Someone You Love, Because Of Love?\"\r\nThis is quite an intelligent anime with two stunningly exciting opening episodes.  It explores guilt and love; goodness and evil in human heart.  Its emotions are genuine and are multi-textual.  If you understand the tag-line(the question) above, you would probably understand what I mean.  This anime greatly portrays the complication of mixed human emotions.  Does love triumph over hate?   Does doubt show even in the strongest-willed person when he is placed in despair?\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is one of my favorite songs all time.  The opening animation also fits the song's lyrics very well.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I have enjoyed the anime so much that I couldn't wait for the good quality one to download and had to watch the blurry one on YouTube. \\n\\n\r\nGa-Rei -Zero- is currently my favorite anime.",

Its cool because you really see the development between the two.   \r\nArt: The art is great. Its pretty and colorful. The fight scenes are executed nicely and done in a manner that you won't feel a blow to the cranium. The character designs are nice as well.

            "content": "\"A good prequel and a fairly good promotional adaptation.\"\r\nOrigin :\r\nI came across an AMV with this Anime (last episode at that) and felt fairly attracted to it. The catching phrase \"Will you kill someone you love because of love?\" even more. But in my case....if I can't deny qualitywise it was overall good....I felt rather bored overall. ....Or maybe not that bored....after all, it was enough to make me wanna read the manga.\r\nStory :\r\nFirst of all, we start with a chaotic double episodes which aim is to throw you in the middle of the action. Literaly. Meaning there will be close to no presentation ofanything going on. I have nothing against unconventional approaches, but spending 50 minutes with such a mentality is a dangerous path as it could be more prompt at turning people away than dragging them in. It tries misleading you concerning the main protagonists and I assume this \"trap\" is more or less effective depending of the personal experience of the watcher (well..aside the summary and the poster, of course)\\n\\n\r\nPart of this double episodes will also reveal itself a tad troublesome later on. I specifically think of Kagura's expostion that, put in context, is incoherent with her emotional state. Yes, \"badass\" is a classic when it comes to expositions, but if it's to the price of coherence, I personally prefer to have a less \"cool\" one. \\n\\n\r\nOnce those two episodes passed, you go back in time to learn what led to this, with the real protagonists. These episodes, until episodes 8-9 are rather disconnected from each other and fairly light hearted despite a few darker elements ; what's good about the lightheartedness is that it doesn't commit the mistake to break the show's overall tone, even when it comes to the classical types of fanservices (you know....two close females have to be touchy touchy over each other in all \"sisterlyhood\" ; or the more comedical prone episode where they try making two charas get closer ; which....retrospectively didn't make much sense unless you go with the \"ellipse\"/disconnection theory). You could say it has a fast pace, if you take into consideration how Yomi's father quickly pass from \"I intend to blabla\" to, the next episode already, \"make it sooner\"...because the plot needs to go forward ! They could have just put that scene earlier to give from breath to the watcher, but that's my nitpicking side.\\n\\n\r\nThe last portion of episodes focus on the events directly connected with the first episodes and how it ends. There's one thing that bugged me in that part are the few \"captain obvious\" comments some characters will make upon watching two other charas fight each other and how useless the presence of another one is as he basically comes, saves and then leaves in all but five minutes. They could have just come up with a less artificial moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the writing is good. And that's taking the context of this adaptation of course.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't know yet, this \"adaptation\" is actually a promotional Anime for the manga, a prequel to enlighten some charas and expand their background. I have no idea how well it does on that aspect, as I haven't read the manga yet, however, when watching this prequel, it seems they took a decision : focus on those who know the manga without making it too hermetical for newbies. This balance was achieved quite well. Sure, the universe isn't really out-built - because the readers should know it anyway - but, even if newbies wouldn't understand every references or details, they can still appreciate the Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\\n\r\nI've spent several paragraphs on the story already, so I will keep this part short, as there isn't much to say anything. Overall, there's no blatant issue. The writing is good. You could feel there's a lack of development of some and it could be the case, but my ignorance of the manga couldn't make me say if there's indeed a lack or if it is part of the decision to focus on a restricted number of charas as the manga should be compensating said issue.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one thing to complain is that sometimes their introduction could have been put earlier for a better flow and make some episodes less predictable as you end up knowing what a new introuction will lead to. It can also give of a feeling of having a pacing not entirely mastered, too fast in this case.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound :\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and drawings are really good most of the time. From time to time there's a slight drop in backgrounds, including the last episode, but overall there's nothing to sneeze on. Except maybe the 3D monsters. To be honest, at first I wouldn't have complained about it, as it could have been done for contrast purpose, but upon seeing some monsters in 2D, I changed my mind and think they should have melt their 3D better with the 2D.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, sound design and voice acting are doing their job properly without it being particularly groundbreaking or anything. ...No...I really don't have anything to say about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you know the manga, this Anime remains grandly watchable. I would say, as it is a promotional Anime, to start with the manga first, but I am aware many Anime watchers barely read any mangas, so for those, they could still go with the Anime, even if, naturally, it will remain an incomplete experience. As for me, I shall go read the manga now.",

There have been numerous animes that go about wasting episodes on pointless drama that does not add to the story but this does not happen in Ga-rei: Zero. I always think this when watching an anime: What is your point? Ga-rei:Zero doesn't disappoint; its short and bitter(because of the sadness in the story). \r\nMy only gripe with this anime is that the first episode had me confused on what the show was about. It seemed to me that it was someone else, not Kagura and Yomi, who was the maincharacter. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, depsite it being all supernatural, Ga-rei: Zero felt realistic. Sadness, indecision, greed, envy and ,of course, love and sacrifice.\\n\r\nIt was not simply about killing evil spirits through the routine gain power when in a crisis format but how the spiritual premise of the anime added to the story. \\n\\n\r\nAa a prequel it was very good in my opinion. It gave enough room for the characters to grow further and left us a little teaser for the sequel. Personally though, i didn't like that they aired Ga-rei: Zero first. The juicy little details about Kagura's and Yomi's relationship that was scaattered across the manga made it all the more better. I felt that showing the lead up to the start of the manga would dampened the excitement of watching the sequel. After all, I wouldn't want to go \"oh i knew that already because they told me that in the prequel\"",

I just think it's a great series with interesting twists and a fun plot that gives you a range of emotions. The relationship between Yomi & Kagura and what they have to go through is beautifully developed. \r\nIt's a fantastic show foranyone who enjoys sci-fi, action &/or sentimentality. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening and ending titles are awesome! :3 Great music takes a series a long way in my book!",

            "content": "Powerful. This is the one word I would use to describe this show. Being honest though, I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy something like this. The theme was pictured to me as a buffed up ghost-buster team for japan, which seemed silly and over done. I realized that you have to go past the 1 paragraph summary for an anime and overlook the cover art. This show was a successful piece of work.\r\nNo spoilers (Not even a little). Quick review of what my eyes witnessed.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is a little hard to wrap around if your not in the supernatural state of mind. In otherwords, pay a little attention to where the story jumps in time. The story itself was very thrilling and really pulls on emotions. You can find yourself begging for the next episode immediately. I really cant say there was any issue other than its over before you know it and there's no more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe only reason this gets a 7 is because the scenery was bland, albeit pretty. I'm not talking claymore (anime) bland, just an atmospheric dark tone. This is 100% intentional to match the story that unfolds, so it's just something I wanted to point out. Very nice regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI usually don't have much to say when the show's soundtrack is questioned for review. This time, however, it was superb. Mixed with the story and art, the music was very much on par. You should be able to pick up on it instantly and enjoy it while you watch. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThis was hard to understand at first, no spoilers so bare with me. Once a little time passes by, the curtains rise and you'll notice who the shows about and whats going on. The characters all have special features and you'll want to watch each one develop. As for the \"main\" characters, they will really give you something to watch and love. Great relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI'll make this area quick because what I said above should shout how much I enjoyed myself. It was fun and worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall, this was something unexpected. Like I mentioned in the beginning about this being a weird ghost cop show, it wasn't really that way. Its a story you need to experience and let unfold on your own time. It has all the right ingredients to make an anime shine even in it's small time span of 12 episodes.I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone that wants something to remember.",

You can expect cute girls fighting monsters, heartwarming sister-sister moments between said cute girls, amazing sound and ost, gritty visuals and amazing action animation. (CG is scarce throughout the show) If you'd like a more in-depth analysis continue reading.\r\nI don't know if it happens to everyone or if it's just me but every once in a while you'll stumble across a show that, despite seeing and understanding all of its flaws, you still love to pieces.\r\nWhile I couldn't point my finger at what was wrong qhile I was watching it, I'm fairly certain that Ga-Rei zero is a good exampleof what happens when the pre-production team is not in sync. Let me explain. The feeling I had when watching was that the characters' realism in their acting was all over the place; at times cliche and completely unrealistic, at times really human and interesting;which is also what bugged me at times when it was coupled with the amazing animation of some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of animation, the visuals are amazing. The action scenes are breath taking (which excuses the visually bland dialogue scenes), not afraid of showing blood while not overdoing it and the character designs are charming (my remembering secondary characters' names is proof of that); too bad their development is just outright bad. \\n\r\nThe only secondary characters we are given some background of are Kagura's father and thatone line about the Nabus; heck, we even know more about Kagura's mother,who doesn't even appear, then the agents.\\n\r\nMy only other complaint is about fan service that, while it's not extreme or overly present, it's still way too blatant for its own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music are amazing, they really set the mood. They even feature the singer from Mirai Nikki op (it was one of the best \"ah-ha!\" moments in a while).",

I've never seen such beautiful yet sad battles.\r\nthe story revolves around families with the duty to exorcise all evil. they inherited each of the families' techinques. the strongest of them is the family who controls the great beast byako (yeah, i dont know how to spell it sorry), wherein kagura, our protagonist belongs. after having her mother killed during one of their battles the Isayama family took care of her while her father is very busy fullfilling his duty. that is the timewhen kagura met yomi, the isayama's adopted daughter who is said to be soon to inherit the position as the family's head. from then on they start their lives as sisters and as agents for the Supernatural Disaster Prevention Office. everything was normal (well fighting monsters from time to time is considered normal to them though) until a very strong and very evil opponent made their lives pretty much difficult. i should stop here.hehe i find the story very exciting. there was no dull scene or anything and it even has romance in it.\\n\\n\r\nthe art is splendid. the fight scenes were executed beautifully. even their swords and other weapons were amazing.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters were made to compliment each other. even those with shorter existence will make you curious.each character has their own story to be told but unfortunately this season only showed kagura and yomi's. so i'm sure there will be a 2nd season. there has to be a 2nd season. kagura has to beat that little kid's evil ass!\\n\\n\r\ni do recommend this anime. its not just one of those kill time animes  but something that when you start watching it'll be hard for you to stop.",

I was hooked within the first 10 minutes. This anime got my attention in the first few minutes, I had barely gotten into the show when it suddenly throws an action scene in my face and it was good! \r\nThe first 2 episodes are a bit confusing but after that is a series of flashback episodes which introduces and gives you the background of the characters and of course the relationship between the 2 main characters-Yomi Isayama and Kagura Tsuchimiya.\\n\r\nAs the story progresses you see the development in the relation of Yomi and Kagura and i got really attached to both of them. While focusing on the relation of the main characters the show also has a lot of action which gives an additional layer to the story. I felt that it did lack a bit in the art department as i felt that some of the backgrounds were a bit lacking as well as some of the character expressions were a bit lacking in a few scenes. one can make out that there was a lot of work put into the action sequences as they are very well made.\\n\r\nOverall it is a fun anime to watch and i would recommend it. Ga-Rei:Zero is an anime that not only has the action part covered but also develops the emotional aspect and attachment to the main as well as the supporting characters within the viewer.",

Good anime to watch if you got time and need some action.\r\nIs your destiny decided from the second you were born? Is it possible to change your fate? What if someone you love tried to kill you?\r\nStory - 8\r\nA typical story that was going fluently, and was then distorted by some evil, extraordinary event. A story where this happy life cannot last for ever and things had to change. Struggles of friendship and sacrifices; dilemmas. \r\nHow the episodes startedwas nice from the anime. An unusual start.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nArt? it's art would be art of action anime.\\n\r\nFights are made by gun, heavier shooters for the lower characters, and sword fights and use of familiar called \"Sacred Beast\" for the stronger, main characters.\\n\r\nThose beasts may come from some old legend, maybe not. There was very little background information of the weapons, Sacred Beasts, techniques. \\n\r\nI disliked the drawing of the main characters, preferred them to have some more unique image. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nOther than a normal, plausible OP and ED that goes well with the anime, there was no other music that attracted me. The voices, sound effects do not have defects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are differentiated from the rest in a way. Shows their internal thoughts, main characteristics and attributes supported by past facts.\\n\r\nHowever they lack something epic, and attractive. \\n\r\nThe character development was good. It showed the character form its childhood moment until the show is ended, and how she reacted to all the most important events in her life; how her daily life changed; why she decided what.\\n\r\nSupportive characters are very common... almost like fillers just for the sake of making a system in order to make the story make sense. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nWell yeah, I watched this anime just to list it out, find possible knowledge, and for enjoyment.  The fighting scenes however were 7-8/10, not that exiting. What was enjoying was more the storyline, and seeing how each character made their own decision. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nI was giving this an 8 at first, but somehow while writing the stuff above... it became a 7.\\n\r\nThis anime will serve as a good a joyful time killer. \\n\r\nOverall view: a typical action anime.\\n",

Turns out it was great!\r\nThis anime is about two girls (Kagura) and (Yomi) who refer to themselves as sisters and purify the world they live in of evil and supernatural beings. They train together, live together, eat together, and spend their nights disemboweling demons with sacred blades together. Through the story progression you will understand their backstories and get a lot of character development. I don\u2019t want to spoil too much aboutthe story but Kagura a vanquisher will endure hardships and progress to become strong to take her father\u2019s place one day. I don\u2019t know why but this series reminds me a lot of Blood + from the perspective of the protagonist taking down monsters with her sword so if you liked that series I would recommend Ga-Rei:Zero. \\n",

It gives somehow off feeling I have an issue to name it - at times you feel like every character is a main protagonist, or simply an importantpersona. There is clear lack of truely background characters - or in other terms, background characters have to distinctive art which catches way too much attention than its supposed to.\\n\r\nAs you see I struggle to define exact feeling, but theres something truely OFF. Monsters are kinda cool but too few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\r\nNaive little story. Well, we're not skilled enough to show actual mind break of character so were gonna add an mind controlling item to explain stuff. They kinda tell too much obvious stuff. There's some completely unnecessary fan service - and i kinda got no issue when its funny, i got no issue with casual nudity, but full bare ass shot of 14yr or something girl followed by tits later kinda threw me off while eating.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2/10\\n\r\nCliches in character design and art.

This anime looks like an attempt at making it psychological but instead of making you think it just gives everything on a plate.\\n\r\nI kinda believe they tried to give somehow Berserkish vibe (that how the fuck it got to this point feeling + some tragedy [more emphasis on emotional level tho]) but fell way short.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nSeriously been tempted to rate it way lower. Would be unfair tho.",

            "content": "This is a non spoiler review of Ga-Rei: Zero. \r\nThis anime is a prequel to the Manga and sets the stage for it. The first episode is confusing and I found no place for it in the series. The second episode sets the stage for most of the entire show delving into the lives of the main characters. Main characters fall or grow (albeit at a slower pace for some). \r\nThe story is nice and some episodes do end in cliffhangers which make you want to see the next one, and the next one to see how the story unfolds. Don't do that, enjoy whatyou've seen, make a brake and see the next episodes the next day to fully enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of fan service here, nudity scenes, simulated sex scenes, all containing girls, also the skirts are way too short. \\n\\n\r\nThere is decent amount of gore and deaths especially in the last few episodes. The art and animation are done nicely and look really well. There are scenes where corners have been cut though, facial expressions could be better, instead some look a bit bland without details.\\n\\n\r\nThe saddest part of this series is that it does not continue in anime form and it's a pity since the idea behind the series and the animation is good. This anime being 2011 and with no news of any anime form 6 years later I think there is no hope for a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is to watch this series even if it's a bit old and with no continuation for it, the ending is satisfying enough, if you are not satisfied enough, read the manga afterwards but not before, it will ruin the story.",

            "content": "This is a really enjoyable anime. It starts with a really fast paced full action packed episode that leave you with a mild smile, and a face of what the heck??? And for the action junkies (like myself) the third episode will leave you yet again with a face of 'what the heck?' but this time, becuase you may be expecting even more action. But you won't get it, not for several episodes, just don't drop the anime after a few episodes without action, you'll regreat it.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story is solid, well developed, but sometimes rushed, while others rather slow. It develops around agirl named Kagura, and how she gets to control a spirit eater demon.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art most of the time is good, but it fails when it comes to a spirit which is computer generated which seems out of place. It make it feel like a cheap anime, the action sequences are great, but yet again that monster leaves you with a feeling of why thet even bothered to make such a lame monster.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe sound is good, not impressive, but not bad. You get to feel the action through the sound, and the music set a great mood in every sequence when needed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThis anime is all about character development. In the first episode you get to see so much characters that you don't have the slightest idea of what's going on, it gets even worst when the episode finish, since you stay with a doubt about every single thing. The confusion is self explained when the story develops, but just in part, since there are left some characters undeveloped, but it works since they doesn't matter in the main story. In the end, you get to know very well all the characters, and the reason of their actions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nIt's really enjoyable, even tho it switches from action to slice of life really fast (I will explain it later on), it still is good. When you finish the anime, you may be even want to watch it more than once because of the details that are really amazing, and that may go unnoticed in the first watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nAs I stated before it starts with a full action episode which is really amazing, but then it switches to a very slow paced, character development episode, and it keeps that way for at least 5 episodes. While some action junkies may be disapointed of the switch from full action to slice of life in such an abrupt way, don't get hasty, you will get action later on, and in the end you'll get to watch the first and second episode several times, just because it will be great.",

            "content": "Ok this is my first review so here goes. I will try to make a review that works without spoilers.\r\nI watched all of Ga-Rei Zero (GRZ) in one sitting mainly because I couldn\u2019t get enough. The plot was gripping and the action was very good and well placed. \r\nThe overall animation was smooth and well drawn and the voices were top notch.\r\nSo where to start? The first two episodes are used to great effect, hooking you into the story and leaving you on a cliff hanger that isn\u2019t reviled until later in the anime. This gives you the viewer a new perspective on the restof the anime, always wondering how it all fits together and wanting to know more. \\n\\n\r\nThe over arcing plot of Ga-Rei Zero is very good and fits perfectly into the 12 episodes. Any longer and things could possibly have become drawn out and tired and any smaller the plot would have felt cramped into too small a space. The story itself is fantastically multi layered telling a the story of a young girl thrust into the world of exorcising demons but also of the love between Yomi and Kagura. The plot drives well up until the climactic finish but also leaves itself wide open for the manga sequel Ga-Rei (something which I now must read).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I found the action in GRZ very good. The sword fights were well made and interesting use the weapons and environment gave some fights an extra level.  Some people didn\u2019t like the array of somewhat ridiculous weapons the supporting members of the cast had but I found they added a little comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nThe music as to be expected of an action anime really adds another level of depth to the anime. Agematsu, Noriyasu really does a good job with each piece of music complimenting the action.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion if you are an action anime fan then this is defiantly worth a watch. I rarely give out 9\u2019s or 10\u2019s out of 10 and this is no exception, it certainly deserves the \u201cvery good\u201d that denotes an 8 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can\u2019t get my head round is why they haven\u2019t made Ga-Rei an anime yet!!?\\n\\n\r\nI hope this has been helpful to you all.\\n",

If you pay close attention you can see that it is slightly flawed but aside from that it looks great and combat when it is around, is entertaining and pretty legit.\r\nThe sound and music is solid. The characters get along really well and are pretty well thought out. The story starts out confusing because it starts near the end and then backtracks which is really the best way to handle what happens. It is done well.\r\nThere are a few moments that make no sense. At one point a character comments onthe unnecessary movements they had in battle even though they were fighting something that was mimicing them, which is really the only  situation where this statement could be flawed. Another example is it is mentioned that one of the characters has advanced techniques with battle however these techniques are never mentioned before or after this converstation and are never seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is actually really good. The characters all get along in differnet ways and feel very lifelike and are consistany throughout the whole show. They are actually just as interestaining as the combat and action, which really gets the viewer pumped.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Solid stuff!",

            "content": "-\r\nThis review was written as a script for a video-review, so it may be a bit weird to read for some people. You can either ignore that and read it, or watch it and listen to me:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxFm3S640zA\r\n-\r\nGa-Rei: Zero,having aired in 2008's fall season, is a 12 episode prequel to Hajime Segawa's manga \u201eGa-Rei\u201c. It's an action-drama with a bit splatter,\r\nthough giving of a SoL-like atmosphere at times, was directed by Ei Aoki and animated by studios AIC Spirits and Asread.\r\nGa-Rei: Zero is a story about two girls, Isayama Yomi and Tsuchimiya Kagura, in a world, in which so called vanquishers fight against phantoms,\r\nmonsters invisible tothe normal human eye. After Kagura's mother dies in a fight against those phantoms, and with her father not having much time to bring her up, she is sent to live with one of his close friends and his daughter Yomi. Over the course of 3 years, these two girls become not only best friends, but sisters, sharing a deep and seemingly unbreakable bond.\\n\r\nBut, due to the structure of the show, which starts at the end of these 3 years and then goes back to when the girls first meet, we know that Yomi turns evil at some point, and the show is full on set on explaining why that happens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't know, for me personally, characters and their relationships are important. Like really, really important. And Ga-Rei does that really well.\\n\r\nIn itself, the characters aren't that special. To be honest, the only two worth mentioning may as well be Yomi and Noriyuki, her fianc\u00e9e, but Yomi and Kagura together are just one of my favorite teams in all anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nYomi is great. She's a fun older sister, giving her best to crack open Kagura, who's timid in the beginning, but is also a really hard worker and has her fair share of problems. All in all, I'd say she feels the most like an actual person, and not just a character.\\n\\n\r\nKagura on the other hand, she's nowhere near Yomi's level.\\n\r\nShe's sad about her mothers death, she had a very strict upbringing by her father, and is incredibly talented, but there isn't really anything genuine in these features. What feels genuine though, is her admiration of Yomi.\\n\r\nShe idolizes her big sister, which makes Kagura's shock of her going rouge on their team of vanquishers that more understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are one-dimensional and bland, Izuna Noriyuki being the only one with more importance, as he's got a bond over the ordinary \u201ebeing colleagues\u201c with Yomi, being her fianc\u00e9e, but still, there's not that much more.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this is just about everything hugely positive I can squeeze out of the show, but I want you to understand, that if you value character relations as highly as I do, this is amazing. The posed question of  \u201eWould you kill someone you love, because you love them?\u201c made me really invested in Yomi's and Kagura's bond.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it also handles the task of \u201ebeing a prequel\u201c pretty well, with most of the show taking place in the past of the first two episodes. We basically know that Yomi's got something going on before we really know her or Kagura at all. This is great, as readers of the manga already know of their relationship, putting both returning fans and new watchers on about the same level of knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is on a level just above average. There weren't any panning shots over still images I could notice, but often, only mouths would move during dialogues. Something is always in motion, but there's not too often a lot of it.\\n\\n\r\nNext, I have to mention monster and weapon design, as this is one of Ga-Rei's weaknesses. Except for the metroid-like latchers and Byakuei, the spirit beast of the Tsuchimiya-family, I didn't like any of the phantoms. Many of them seemed off, or just boring. Same goes for the weapons, there's a character fighting with suitcases or one with a drill, which annoyed me whenever I saw them. Kaguya's pressure-powered sword and the naginata that can turn into an umbrella were pretty cool though.\\n\\n\r\nIn the OST, we have a pretty decent selection of different soundtracks. From action-rich to sentimental, I think there's something for everyone to like. Personally, the best one were #3 -\u201cMegalocytic shadow\u201c  and #5 - \u201eExecution\u201c, because they reminded me a bit of \u201eTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann\u201c, and #8 - \u201eReincarnation\u201c, just because I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all this talk may have seem a bit messy, but as always, the final question posed: Is \u201eGa-Rei: Zero\u201c worth watching?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm really sad that I can't recommend this show to everyone. I'd like to say yes, but only if you really care about characters, and if you find yourself not liking Yomi after a few episodes, it's fully understandable if you'd drop the show. That said though, the first 2 and final 3 episodes were really cool and with its decent fill of action, I can see people enjoying those, if not the rest. Also, it's one of my favorite shows and too few people have seen it, but I don't want it get forgotten over the years, making me really thankful for every person deciding to watch it.",

Is it right to hide who we really are from the ones we love? To protect them? Important questions like those are answered in here...\r\nTwo first episodes got me hooked by showing an advanced stage of its story. I want to know what came earlier, what happened, and they showed it... Nice way to keep my attention, as story goes on and reveals everything.\r\nSo Kagura and Yomi are both from exorcist families and, upon meeting eachother, a strong relationship is born. It seemed like this bound would last forever, but hate is able to corrupt our souls, as we let our darkest feelings take control... But, as many say, \"love always wins\", on a different way this time...\\n\\n\r\nKagura was an innocent girl, dragged to this demon fighting stuff because of her ancestrals, but Yomi changes everything, as she considers Kagura as her little sister. Close to the end, a final test begins, proving that compassion may get you killed, even if your opponent was someone once dear to you...\\n\\n\r\nBattle scenes were very well made and art was... Mature... It's pretty violent, but I like that... Characters were nicely developed and the ending was great! And there's a gunblade on it! It's a katana, but works the same way as Squall's one! A surprise and a really impressive choice, points for that!\\n\\n\r\nAnd why should watch this one? Obviously that this anime is one of those underrated ones, that only a few people outside Japan get to know... I had my reasons, none related to the plot tough... But I enjoyed it, surely an amazing one and really worthy, as we can learn a lot from it... Give it a shot, you won't regret it!",

The plot just give the whole show its justice, I for instantly never read the manga before I watched it. but I did enjoy it without looking for the background of each character because they already describe at its full length. \r\nIt gives  me different emotion while watching this anime, first curiosity, especiallyin the first two episode followed by confusion like \"the hell they killed all the character\" the why question will definitely pop in your brain.  then second the excitement in every action in each episode is keep me watching right after the next, then sadness, yeah I cried at episode 9 and at the end.\\n\\n\r\nthough I did enjoy it, it still have some flows like loose end, or the anime itself was cut short but its understanding cause its a prequel but it still a bit dissapointing.",

            "content": "Just finished Ga Rei -Zero- today! It has spurred me to write yet again. Here's my non-spoiler review:\r\nI'm not too familiar with the anime that came out in recent years, and Ga Rei Zero was one of them. I suppose it had a pretty low profile, and I didn't bother to read any synopsis of it either. I picked it up after viewing one of the threads in this forum about \"The Best First Episode\". It seemed that unanimously, it was chosen as -the- anime that had the best first episode. Being rebellious in nature, I decided to check it out for myself.\r\nThe first thingthat surprised me was the Art of Ga Rei -Zero-. Somehow it looked like cel-rendered anime for a moment when I started it. A theatric cel work at it, meaning it's really beautiful. I loved the cel-anime era, so yeh it's personal bias. But really, it's CG and the style it is done in really blew me away. The environment is pretty colourful but not overdone such that it appears really flowery. It just felt really original and new.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that pumped up the mood was the insert music, or some will call it the soundtrack. I'm not sure if the O.S.T. will sound great standalone, but it's inserted at really appropriate moments, especially the first half of the series. It plays a really important role for the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I think the success of this composition is attributed to the brilliance of the direction. The sequencing, screenplay, and harmony of all the animation elements fall nicely in place. The screenplays were notably excellent.\\n\\n\r\nI'd definitely recommend this anime. It deserves a high 7/10 for overall.",

Some of the character interactions also feel undeveloped relative to the the two main heroines of the show and although the actual progression of the story as a whole is lacking, there are some interesting sonorities - How arrangedmarriages affect two people\u2019s relationships, what it may say about the parent(s), how deep does blood go and how deep does adopting a familial relationship go, how does hate, pride, and shame affect you when you\u2019re in a state of powerlessness  - but it\u2019s ruined by hasty development and a main heroine that feels very tiring to watch, like every single movement by her feels exasperated. What effect this has on viewing the show is like reading a book that on the whole you don\u2019t really like but you continue to read regardless because there are some interesting paragraphs sprinkled around that give off glimmers of promise. I often felt something when it came to the other heroine, probably because of the relative rarity of her crying, and her genuine moments of tragedy. In the end, however, the good of this show didn\u2019t really overlap the bad or at least not to the point where I could justify a higher score.\\n",

If you've read even a bit of the manga, you know exactly who will live and who will die, and the first two episodes basically show what happens in the end. So the point of the anime is not the epic plot twists or anything like that. It's the RIDE of showing how the characters have become the way they are by the time the Ga-Rei manga begins. But man, it is a GOOD ride. I'm not even a fan of shoujo-ai, and I enjoyed the series, most likely because it's debatable whether thetwo girls like each other more than just sisters or not.The fights are especially fun to watch, if you don't mind a lot of blood. The animation is great, too. Really, I'd give it a 9 or 10, except those are reserved for anime I'd watch more than once. Ga-rei was very good, but once was more than enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10. The story of Yomi and Kagura is both sweet and heartbreaking. And, I mean, it's gotta be pretty damn good if it starts off leaving pretty much no surprises but is still badass, tear-jerking, and interesting. I also think it's one of the better school girls with magic powers anime I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10. Nothing super original, but the art is clear and crisp and the animation is well-done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10. I wasn't in love with any of the characters, but I was sympathetic to all of them. Some of the characters are a little too ridiculous, though.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment - 8/10. It was very entertaining, but I wasn't glued to my seat like I would be for a 9 or a 10. Still, an 8 from me is pretty darn good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10. Like I said earlier, I wouldn't watch it again, but doing so one was an excellent use of my time.",

The best thing about this one is probably going to be the graphics.\r\nTo be completely frank, the anime starts off amazingly, cool fight, cool characters, the whole introduction was done really well. You get a good view into the universe and what to expect. \r\nAnd if you haven't even watched the first episode i suggest you do so, cause *spoiler* that entier view ofyours is butchered up into fine pieces, along with what you thought where the main characters. Brilliant, this one starts on episode 2 and not episode 1...\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, yeah, i get where they are going with it. Killing the main characters is generally a jawbreaking and intriguing thing to do. But they need to be just that, main characters for it to really take effect. It's like dropping a fully made cake you made on the floor versus dropping just the bowl of ingredients.\\n\\n\r\nGa-Rei: Zero, is just this bowl of perfectly fine ingredients with potential to make an incredibly good cake, but which someone has just spilt on the floor.\\n\\n\r\nDon't take me wrong, it's not a terrible anim\u00e9 and you'll probably like it alot more than i did.

Watch Elfen Lied.\\n\r\nDo you like psychology? Watch another or Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you think you'll like this one, go ahead i'm not hear to stop you. BUT if you ask me there are plenty good anim\u00e9s who have covered similar stories in ways that are far superior to this.\\n\\n\r\nGa-Rei: Zero, could have been a masterpiece. Id had A LOT of potential which just, didn't come out quite as good as it could have.\\n\\n\r\nNow i've spent far too much time writing this, and not doing things im supposed to.

            "content": "Wow. Well, what can I say? I fell in love with the style, action, and mythology of this series from the start, and the characters are those whom I wanted to know more of and cared about. The first episode for me is what drew me in, wanting to know what exactly was going on, and I am a fan of reversed or out of sequence chronology. However, I agree with many others that the overall story arc is, well, saddening. The ending in particular may leave you feeling a bit empty inside and wishing things could have stayed the way they were 'round aboutepisode six. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those rare series that I would like to watch again but don't dare to at the same time. It is beautiful and haunting but depressing as well. It felt a lot like reading a Ken Follett novel. Bad things continue to happen to good people, and you keep thinking and hoping that things will get better, but they don't. Still I'd certainly recommend this series, just so long as you can offset the tragedy with a healthy dosing of something a bit more upbeat.",

            "content": "A tragic story of two sisters. Ga-Rei Zero is exactly that. I will try not to spoil the anime for anyone reading this review, but no promises. Read this at your own risk. \r\nStory: The plot was very original, I don't think I've seen an anime that could start so well, and end with such a great not in just 12 episodes. This anime is truly one of a kind, and it is ridiculously underrated. The first 2 episodes are actually somewhere around the end of the story. And episodes 3-11 are flashbacks, telling what happened before the first 2 episodes. And finally episode 12finishes it. This was quite effective, the first 2 episodes hook you, and make you wonder what's going on, then they play flashback episodes which fill you in, then they kill it with the final episode which was indeed very epic. \\n\\n\r\nArt: All I can say here is that the action scenes are beautiful. The only reason this is not a 10 is because it's an old anime, but very good for its time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm not one for Japanese opening and ending scenes, but the soundtrack Ga-Rei Zero was not bad at all. But the music did seem very techno-like and I didn't really enjoy that. Though for some of the scenes, the music did seem to fit the mood. I think there was only one song that I liked, and it was played around *SPOILER* the end of Episode 7, for Yomi's fathers death. The music for battles needed to be more epic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development was extremely well done, it showed how both of the sisters grew to love each other, and how they had gone through similar experiences. I just wish that Yomi had shown more emotion, she seemed to happy even though all that had happened to her. And then she went evil which was to much of a drastic change. But overall it had great characters. Also another side note, I wish that they had added a bit more with Yomi and Nori, showing how they're relationship developed, it just seemed that one day they hated each other and the other day they fell in love. Just didn't seem to make sense, but I guess they just went with the flow. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy this anime and I will have to rate it a solid 9/10",

            "content": "I'll say this about Ga-Rei Zero: the show certainly is engaging. It was on my backlog for a while, but when I finally brought myself to watch the first episode, I found myself marathoning the whole show that same day. The show will surprise you into continuing to watch, and unlike other shows (Elfen Lied comes to mind) the element of surprising the audience is used tastefully enough that it doesn't become repetitive and cheesy. The themes Ga-Rei: Zero contain are thought-provoking without being heavy-handed. Be ready to finish the show when you start, if you decide to start.\r\nPlot: It's hard to describe the plotof Ga-Rei: Zero without spoiling the show (something I vow never to do on MAL) but it centers around themes of betrayal, and shows a convincing picture of how a villain is created. It's concise but not rushed, and fits into the series length perfectly. While overall it's well-done, the plot contains some confusing elements. Admittedly, since Ga-Rei: Zero is a prequel series to Ga-Rei (the manga), Zero leaves some questions to be answered in the manga, but still would benefit from a little more explanation. 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where Ga-Rei: Zero really shines. The relationship of the two main heroines, Kagura and Yomi, is what drives most of the events of the plot and showcase the themes. Both are exceedingly human and relatable, and react appropriately when driven apart. Most of the supporting characters are expectedly flat, but a few others, such as Yomi's fiancee and Kagura's father, contain a pleasant amount of depth-enough to really \"support\" the protagonists, while not stealing the spotlight. 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: I wish I could rate this section higher, I really do. There's a lot I like about the visuals. The backgrounds were colorful but not over-saturated. The character design is not strikingly impressive, but each drawn person fits well with his or her personality. The fights are fluid and dramatic, but not overly so (Bleach anyone?). But the visuals take a big hit from the horrible use of CG alongside Cel-shading. This doesn't always make a bad show, but it did here. The CG's framerate is different from the cel-shading, and the different textures make a jarring contrast. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The voice actors were generally for both the English and the Japanese dub. Yomi in particular is very well-voiced in both. The music is nothing special, but fits the each scene pretty well, so no complaints there. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Ga-Rei: Zero is a show that will get you hooked for sure. Almost every episode ends in a cliffhanger, and each one really works. It's certainly no Ghibli or Kyoani (Kyoto animation) work as far as a sensory experience, but still works well enough to tell the great storyline, and show the really awesome characters. It's a little content-heavy (a good amount of blood, brief nudity, and enough foul language to disturb those who are bothered by it) but not enough to distract from those two elements that make it so engaging to watch. If you have a free afternoon, give it a chance. 8.3/10",

Characters I thought would play significant roles, got totally discarded. Nonetheless, the anime is a good watch",
