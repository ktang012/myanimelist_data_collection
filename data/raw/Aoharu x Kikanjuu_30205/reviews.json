            "content": "I don't think I've ever seen an anime with as many blatant plot holes and as much inconsistent writing as Aoharu x Kikanjuu. Now that doesn't mean it's the worst anime ever made (it definitely isn't), but it has a huge amount of wasted potential due to its weak story, horrendous characterization, and the fact that the author is seemingly completely clueless about how airsoft works.\r\nInitially the anime feels like something quite similar to Ouran Koukou Host Club as the protagonist is a girl (Tachibana Hotaru) crossdressing as a boy who ends up becoming indebted to a popular guy (Matsuoka Masamune) who works as ahost in the city. This notion is then quickly proven highly inaccurate as Matsuoka forces Tachibana to come join his \"survival game\" team and participate alongside him in an upcoming tournament. I say survival game, but that in and of itself is completely wrong; it's actually just competitive airsoft that we're talking about here. I don't know if it's a mistranslation or whatnot but either way if you're expecting some sort of thrilling life-or-death drama here you're going to be sorely disappointed because there is absolutely nothing lethal in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is it that makes Aoharu x Kikanjuu such a trainwreck then? Well there are many reasons but they can be roughly divided into three categories:\\n\\n\r\n1. The plot\\n\r\nThe writing for this anime is bad. Terribly bad. The games themselves make no sense whatsoever (more on that later), but even ignoring that part the overall plot progression is simply all over the place. Initially, Tachibana thinks the airsoft games are childish and stupid. Then after playing *one* game she suddenly thinks they're the greatest thing ever and has become a full-blown addict. Sounds believable, right? Oh and you know how she originally joined the team because of a debt? Yeah that plot element is just handwaved away in a split second as if it never existed to begin with, completely ruining the entire premise of the story, yet it just keeps on going as if nothing ever happened.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also all kinds of forced drama which feel completely unnecessary, totally out of place, and oftentimes insanely predictable. Time skips are pulled haphazardly which renders the pacing very inconsistent, and above all, there seems to be no semblance of coherence in the writing whatsoever. Let me just describe a certain scene from episode two here in order to make an example (minor spoilers I guess, but certainly nothing important): there is a segment where Tachibana is surrounded by her three opponents at only a few meters range. Then in the next second they're suddenly all standing on the same side of her, yelling \"corner her!\", as if implying that they hadn't already cornered her a second ago? Immediately thereafter, Tachibana's teammate suddenly appears next to her and they have a loud conversation for about two minutes. What happened to their opponents? They were standing right next to her just a moment ago! How could they possibly have lost track of her, let alone be outside hearing range? I mean seriously just what happened here, did the producers accidentally put the scenes in the wrong order or something? These kinds of elementary mistakes should be impossible to make. It's so blatantly illogical it feels like it was written by a 12-year-old.\\n\\n\r\n2. The characters\\n\r\nAoharu x Kikanjuu is pretty blatant fujoshi bait; that much is obvious from the get-go, but even so the character cast is still a disaster. First of all, we have our main character Tachibana Hotaru. Mother of god is she annoying. About once per minute she has to remind the audience that despite her appearance she's actually a girl, she's always referring to herself in third-person and her sole personality trait is seemingly that she firmly believes in \"justice\". Yeah justice; hence why she goes completely berserk when playing airsoft and behaves like an uncontrollable animal; sounds just like a knight in shining armor, doesn't she? In the first place what does justice have to do with playing games? Are your opponents supposed to be \"evil\" just because they're playing or something? In that case Tachibana is obviously equally guilty of that crime. There's also the obnoxious truth that despite being a really bad player, Tachibana always ends up spontaneously gaining super powers whenever the plot feels like it, solely for the sake of convenience. The anime never shuts up about her so-called \"bloodlust\" which is the ability she uses to magically paralyze her opponents just by looking at them and make them cower in fear, as well as enable her to run faster than a speeding bullet. But there's nothing supernatural about this or anything, it's just her \"talent\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the rest of the characters in this show goes (essentially all male), they're basically all cardboard cutouts as well. Matsuoka is the typical noble bishounen with a \"dark past\", Yukimura (the third team member) is quiet, depressive and honestly kind of creepy, and then there's the overly-generic villain Midori who's just an all-round douchebag that enjoys hurting people. They all feel like they're solely there for the sake of being there, but without much thought put into it whatsoever. And the way they behave towards each other is completely unnatural. At one moment Matsuoka is almost pissing himself with fear just by looking at Midori, and in the next he's being super cocky and confident. Again, consistency please. There are also quite a lot of soft Yaoi vibes every here and there throughout the show, which I guess is to be expected given the fujoshi pandering but it still feels very out of place story-wise.\\n\\n\r\n3. The \"survival games\"\\n\r\nEverything I've stated above is certainly problematic, but without a doubt the nail in the coffin is the execution of the so-called \"survival games\" themselves. Honestly I don't think the author has ever played airsoft before, or even studied up on how it works properly. I'm going to be very direct here: airsoft is primarily a game of tactics, stealth and precision. It's a game where you attempt to predict the opposing team's moves ahead of time, try to hide and ambush them by sniping them from the shadows, etcetera. I don't even think you need to have played the game before to understand that much. So what does Aoharu x Kikanjuu do then? Well... it basically treats airsoft like a battle shounen.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know what you do with guns? You shoot each other with them. Yeah right, not in this anime; here you avoid using them, charge straight down the barrel of your opponent's rifle, *paralyze* him with fear just by looking at him and thus render him incapable of pulling the trigger, then run into melee range and finally bludgeon the guy by using your submachine gun as a club. Excellent work Tachibana; you were even able to outplay the guy using a freaking minigun by using this incredible strategy! Truly a job well done. While we're at it we should start teaching the military that there's no need for guerilla warfare any longer; simply running up to your enemies and punching them in the face sounds like a much more humane way of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that's far from the only problem when it comes to how these games play out. People refusing to shoot when they have their opponents in their sights for no apparent reason, people having to hold clich\u00e9 speeches and punchlines before pulling the trigger, people revealing their positions completely needlessly in order to have a \"fair fight\" with their opponent instead of just shooting them from cover, etcetera. The list goes on. Even more disturbing though, these games are seemingly completely unmonitored. Despite playing in a high stakes tournament, there are no cameras or anything inside the woodland battlefield. In other words there's barely even any point of having rules for this game; you could basically cheat as much as you'd like and no one will ever know. But I guess that's just another plot hole which we shouldn't think too much about and instead just pretend it isn't there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that said, is there anything good thing about this show? Well if there's one thing it'd be that despite everything it at least isn't boring. Incredibly annoying yes, but twenty minutes of Aoharu x Kikanjuu per week was not really a problem. It's kind of like watching a very low level football game; even if the content itself is lackluster, you can still probably find some enjoyment in it just by being a football fan to begin with. In the same way, despite the cringeworthy execution, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is so far the only anime I've ever seen about airsoft, so it gets some plus points for originality and for having a fun concept at least. But even with that taken into account it doesn't change the fact that it is still a very sub-par anime at best, and not one I would particularly recommend to very many people.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is a action, comedy, shounen genre anime about a girl named Tachibana Hotaru mistaken for a boy. This anime has personally exceeded my original expectations since the first episode. Just a quick warning this is my first review. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story mainly follows Tachibana Hotaru's point of view. The episodes have a smooth flow in them, it always kept me on my toes(engaged) and loves making me scream at the screen for another episode. As everyone might know this anime is being compared to 'Ouran High School Host Club\u2019 and I have to say I agree. Aoharu x Kikanjuu really does havethat Ouran feel but since there two complete different anime\u2019s don\u2019t expect the same storyline. The storyline is very easy to understand because as the story begins to unravel you can tell where the story will be headed, it was very predictable at times but even so it was still very enjoyable to watch. There is a bit of a rush in some episodes but the story really recovers from those rushes. As you all know this anime is also a comedy anime, this scenes always seemed to make me laugh a lot and it really made my day a whole better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is very not that realistic but it very good to the extent that you can see everything clearly. The animation is unique because it really achieve certain moods throughout the series. I personally think this is the animation that would be the best for Aoharu x Kikanjuu i wouldn\u2019t ask for a better animator. The character designs are very fitting, for example Matsuoka, Masamune is a host they have deliberity made him really hot and his friend Yukimura a very indoors looking character. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the characters were really good they all matched up perfectly. Tachibana Hotaru\u2019s voice actor was really amazing personally because her voice really did sound a lot like a boy\u2019s voice at some points and it really made the character fit in to her role perfectly. The opening to Aoharu x Kikanjuu is great especially how the actual characters are actually singing the opening which makes the voice actors and opening in this anime the more better. If this were to be dubbed I think it wouldn\u2019t be to the standard of the original voice actors. During the scenes that unfolded during the anime, OST\u2019s were played and they all absolutely fitted into the scene and mood and the soundtracks was also one the aspects the exceeded my expectations for this anime, I would love to list to the OST\u2019s if they are released soon. I loved both opening and ending because I just liked the songs that played especially the opening because the voice actors actually sang it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs every anime has are characters. The characters in Aoharu x Kikanjuu were really well-rounded they all had their strengths and weakness. The characters had the right reaction to every problem that popped up in a realistic way. I can really relate some characters from this anime to other anime\u2019s as well and I have to say they really had some character development, you won\u2019t notice it at first but you will. I would remember all the main characters in this anime because they all had their different personality\u2019s and it was very enjoyable to see them slowly change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already recommended this anime to many of my friends and it\u2019s been positive feedback from them, how can you not enjoy a anime like this? It keeps you engaged, it makes you laugh and even makes you scream at the screen sometimes. Non-anime fans would probably enjoy this anime and as well as manga fans, anyone any age would. In future I am going to re-watch this anime again because it really makes my day watching it I would skip certain parts but not all of it. It was unique I don\u2019t get this engaged with some anime\u2019s most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 9. To summarise the story is very engaging it keeps you on your toes. The animation really fits in with this anime because it pictures the characters with their personalities really well. The voice actors are just perfect they even sang the opening theme to the anime and you don\u2019t see that much with most anime. The characters really develop during the series at first its not clear but at the end you can see they definitely changed a bit. I enjoyed this very much my friends did too so I think everyone in the whole world basically would too. \\n",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is those stories that may be hit or miss, for some it might be annoying, for others it may be the start of something good.\r\nI fall in the later category.\r\nIt may be annoying because there's no development of characters, for me Tachibana Hotaru is a promising main character, but there is a lack of background story, or intentions, that make her character quite annoying or plain. For example her sense of justice would be enjoyable if there would be a reason behind it, a story to tell us why this character think that way, but, as the story progress, it tell usthat her sense of justice is not what we all think of, hence the lack of explanation. But, Tachibana is also someone who stick to her ideals, values friendship and inspires others to go on; which makes her someone to admire, in some kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nBut, not every character lack a past of some kind, Yukimura is an example, you can watch him grow as a person and actually be fond of him as he helps each of the main characters to do what is right for the team, he has a background that explains his insecurities. Though sometimes his character might be annoying because of the unnecessary ero-anime love he has.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it needs a second season, definitely. There's some parts of it left open that needed explanations. But, for twelve episodes, there's a rush in the story that kills it a bit, Tachibana's love for survival game is an example of it, since it grows from \"I hate this, I just want to pay my debt\" to \"I need to play this game forever, I'm never going to stop\" from one episode to another; also, there's quite the plot hole going on with the antagonists, since there's no reason behind their behaviour. However it also has points to love, for example the friendship between the protagonists that grows with every episode and, also, it kind of surprise that some characters are not what they seem, there's more than meet the eye!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, the colors from certain scenes left me breathless! there's nothing to complain there; also the OST is quite nice, I'm loving the opening song!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend watching it because you may enjoy it, is not an anime for everyone, that's for sure, but you need to be patient with it, also the whole idea of survival game is really refreshing and unique, the art is well done, and the story is not so bad, so why not give it a try? \\n\\n\\n\r\n(ps. sorry for my english)\\n",

            "content": "I first started watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu simply because I thought the art was beautiful. I had no idea what it was about at all.\r\nAnd thus, I can easily say that the art is one of the best points of the series (in my opinion), along with the soundtrack. \r\nAfter the first (few) episodes, I was surprised to see that I actually enjoy a series with 'survival games' as its theme/plot/however to call it.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nIn my opinion, the story itself could be much better if the pace were slower. If the actions, games and such were more detailed, with more depth. \r\nStill, I liked thegeneral idea of the survival games and tournaments and such.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nLike I've mentioned above, the art is the reason I actually started the series and of course, there are many animes with outstanding art, but in my opinion, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of them.\\n\r\nThere were a few scenes where I just sit there, stare at the screen and think 'wow, that's drawn so beautifully'.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI liked the soundtrack - whether we talk about the opening/ending or in-between. It matched whatever was happening and yeah, I simply enjoyed the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nIt would have easily gotten a '10/10' from me if one actually got to know more about all the protagonist (and of course, the other characters as well). I am pretty sure that the characters could have an interesting past, relationship to each other and who-knows-what, but apparently, it's not shown.\\n\r\nThere are many interesting ones and, in my opinion, also quite a few really likable/lovely ones. \\n\r\nSome might turn out weird or the 'development' is kind of... unnatural/too fast, but overall if I thought about 'why did they do that?' the answer/reasoning usually comes to me rather quickly.\\n\r\nAlthough I am sure if one doesn't give much thought about the 'why', the characters might just appear as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that I would have marathoned the series if all episodes were out already when I started watching the anime.\\n\r\nThere were still times where it was kind of 'normal'/'slow' compared to the usual pace of the series and some episodes were full of excitement.\\n\r\nIt was funny, sometimes you might even get goosebumps or just excited/anticipating to see what would happen next.\\n\r\nMost of the time, I thought that it was amusing and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThe part which I'm disappointed about is the fact that there was not enough 'character development' and 'story depth'. \\n\r\nAlso, if the series had a few more episodes to spare, I think it would have gotten a lot better (more time for the events, games, characters etc.).\\n\r\nBut apart from that, I still adore most of the characters shown, even the antagonist(s) are fascinating and the mixture of different personalities is interesting.",

            "content": "Blah blah, Ouran High School Host Club, blah blah. I haven't even seen that one, so I don't care and went in expecting nothing. That aside, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of the worst anime I've seen in a long time. I cannot say anything good about this one.\r\nThe story follows main character Hotaru Tachibana, a reverse trap with a strong sense of justice. Hotaru is put under the impression that her friend Kanae was treated badly at this host club she visited. She goes to investigate and gets into a survival game (airsoft gun fight) with the place's owner, Masamune Matsuoka. The place getsdamaged in the process, and Hotaru is forced to join his survival games team, Toy Gun Gun (a really dumb name that they even point out as being dumb), in order to pay off the damages. This ends up just being an excuse to bring Hotaru into survival games as the paying off the damages part is hand waved pretty shortly afterward. Hotaru soon meets Toy Gun Gun's other member Tooru Yukimura. He initially hates her for no reason other than the fact that she's getting between him and \"Mattsun\" (his nickname for Matsuoka). However, he gets over it really quickly, within the course of one episode. After the team is together, they make it their goal to be the best in Japan. At this point, everything is relatively inoffensive, but the one-dimensional cast of characters and relatively unintersting story aren't earning it any points.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes downhill very quickly. There are two main conflicts in the show, one of them is incredibly pointless, and the other doesn't really go anywhere. First is the issue of Hotaru's gender. Her teammates (and pretty much everyone who doesn't know her) are under the impression that she's a guy. Not too much of an issue at first glance, but it turns out the Matsuoka doesn't allow girls on his team for reasons that you eventually find out, but it ends up not being something you can more or less figure out way before they actually tell it to you near the end of the series. Ultimately, this does nothing but stir up pointless drama. My issue with this is that they could have easily made Hotaru a boy, and the series would have been exactly the same. The issue of her gender is rarely addressed in a meaningful way. They almost came close in one particularly annoying episode somewhat centered around Kanae in which Hotaru is urged to be more feminine and avoid survival games, but what could have been something to address gender stereotypes in a thought provoking way ends up being nothing more than an episode where Hotaru strengthens her resolve through her friend. It's annoying enough that the point of the episode could have gotten across in a much better way if this was done through Hotaru interacting with her teammates, but it's even more infuriating that Kanae's character was clearly written just so this episode could happen. Her only character trait is that she's a girl with pink hair, and she acts as somewhat of a foil to Hotaru's masculine side. But a foils aren't nearly as effective if you almost never have the two of them interact. Without spoiling anything, the issue of Hotaru's gender never goes anywhere. She says she's going to tell her teammates, then you never see her tell them, so it feels like an annoying tease. To make things more insulting, there's even a scene near the end where Hotaru is grabbing Matsuoka's hand and he starts blushing (after doing no such thing the entire series). The groan I let out at the moment was beyond comprehension. It's almost like they're insulting you. Feels like somekind of really lame yaoi fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe other conflict in the story revolves around Matsuoka and another survival game player named Midori. There's apparently some sort of history between the two of them. But ultimately it boils down to Matsuoka really wants to beat his team in a survival game. Outside of the games, when Midori interacts with Hotaru, he's almost creepily friendly. But during the games he's a terrifying sadist, or at least that's what they make him out to be. There's pretty much nothing interesting about Midori's character other than the fact that the story needed some sort of antagonist, so it's really hard to care about him. He's extremely one dimensional. There's not much else to say about this part of the story without spoiling it, but it ends up involving Matsuoka being tormented by his inferiority to Midori and the results of every big tournament his team lost. This doesn't go anywhere particularly interesting, but it ends up making for some really lame drama.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story's pretty bad. The characters are pretty awful as well. On top of being a reverse trap for no reason other than to create some really stupid drama, Hotaru is an extremely frustrating character to have as the main character. She's one of the most annoying leads I've seen in a long time. She has that aforementioned sense of justice, but it's only brought up every once in a while when convenient. She grows to love survival games very quickly, and that almost becomes a point of contention and room for deeper characterization, but they do almost nothing with it. For whatever reason, she has some sort of intense bloodlust when she gets really into a game, but it ends up being nothing other than her eyes are drawn differently and she sort of moves faster. She's actually really bad with a gun, as you find out very quickly. Other than that, I want to slap her every time she opens her mouth. Just imagine an obnoxiously gung ho shounen protagonist with the emotional maturity of a 12 year old girl that gets really excited over everything.\\n\\n\r\nMatsuoka is the closest thing to an intersting character as part of the story revolves around him getting over his issues, but it's extremely hard to care about him when he has so little screen time. It's almost like dedicating the plot to a side character. \\n\\n\r\nYukimura is extremely forgettable. He's a creepy shut-in, pervert that has no friends except Mattsun (and now Hotaru). He was bullied a lot back in the day, and Matsuoka was the one who stood up for him. So now he just has a creepy attachment to him. You could say he's the pervert who's incredibly clingly to Matsuoka and that'd be about the entirety of his character.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character is garbage. I already talked about Midori, so I should mention the side characters... there's like three and I'd be lying if I said they were even fleshed out enough to be one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the two components that matter most, story and characters, are absolute garbage. There's nothing to be said about the music since I can't even recall a single track from the soundtrack, shows how memorable it is, and the art style is kinda bland. The animation is kind of acceptable, but nothing to write home about. So I can't even give it a point or two for that.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I need to talk about the action scenes. This could have been the anime's saving grace, but it was a total let down. All of the choreography of the surival games is out of whack. It's pretty clear that there was little to no spatial awareness in the planning of the action scenes. The best example I could cite: Hotaru is facing down an enemy. The shot implies that there's about 20-30 feet between them. Then when she runs at him, it looks like she's running the distance of a football field. Given that they were in a forest at the time, it's even worse since you could use trees as markers. There were only a few trees near them, yet Hotaru runs by a bunch of them. This sounds nitpicky, but it's really infuriating and totally immersion breaking when given that there's tons of room for realism in the game they're playing. Even stuff like that aside, none of these survival game scenes are particularly fancy. In fact, it often feels like they go out of their way not to show them to you. The first couple of episodes involved Hotaru getting totally hyped to get out and shoot people up, but instead of the viewer getting to see her try, it cuts to her instantly failing and leaving the battlefield. Even when we do see her in action, it's either totally lame or something stupid and immersion breaking like what I described earlier. And at this point I haven't even mentioned how everyone plays this game like they don't even want to win. They're not using real guns, it's not a life or death situation, yet everyone seems to rather talk menacingly to each other instead of just shooting each other. The number of times where someone totally would have gotten shot if the person holding the gun to them just shut up and pulled the trigger is way higher than it should be. How is anyone expected to feel any tension in this already incredibly low stakes (in the grandest scheme of things) game when people are practically refusing to do the only thing you do in it? It's like watching a really bad stereotypical shounen where a fight that could have taken ten minutes last three episodes because no one would shut up and do what they're supposed to be doing. So, the entire show falls apart even on a conceptual level. You're given a realistic game, why not let everyone play it realistically instead of like a really bad fighting shounen? \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is bottom of the barrel. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, but it's pretty close, and I wouldn't feel bad about lumping it together with the only other title I've given a 1 to. The characters are mindnumbingly bad, the story surrounding them gives you no real reason to care about it, and everything else is flat out unimpressive. Also, did I mention that it even manages to have an infuriating flashback filter? It even messes up in that department.\\n\\n\r\n1/10 - I'd have more fun pounding my head against a wall",

            "content": "Meet Hotaru Tachibana, a girl with a strong sense of justice. She is easily mistaken for a boy, because of her broad shoulders, short hair, and confrontational attitude. She has an altercation with a host named Masamune Matsuoka, who mistakes her for a boy. In order to pay for the damage she caused, she joins his survival game group, Toy Gun Gun. The only problem? Girls aren't allowed!\r\nI believe the best way to describe Aoharu's issues in a word is: disorganized. There's comedy, but this isn't a comedy anime. There's some drama, but this isn't drama or tragedy anime. There's a cross-dressing female, but thisisn't a gender bender. And there's some action, but this is by no means an action anime. Like anime such as Kekkai Sensen, Aoharu x Kikanjuu spreads itself too thin over too many genres, and that is what leads to its downfall.\\n\r\nWhile Aoharu has survival games in it, it doesn't have enough action scenes, nor is the animation good enough to distinguish Aoharu as a good action anime. The art isn't amazing enough to be spellbound by it. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS in this paragraph*\\n\r\nLikewise, the anime's plot is weak. What is the goal of the anime? Is it for Hotaru to improve her skills? Considering she doesn't improve much, no. Is it for her to admit she's a girl? Considering that doesn't happen, no. Is it for Toy Gun Gun to win TGC or beat Hoshishiro? Neither of those happens, so no. Is it for Masamune to overcome his vendetta against Midori? While this does happen, it only surfaces as a huge repetitive issue in episode 11 and is solved in episode 12. So no.\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nWithout strong action or plot, characters need to fill that void. Let's look at the characters--are they complex? Hotaru as a black and white view of the world; she sees everything in terms of justice. Masamune has an abandonment complex, but it literally only surfaces in the last two episodes. Yukimura, despite being the most entertaining character of the show, is flat. All we know about him is he is extremely attached to Masamune and is a perv. Midori is a sadist, which is fine, but we don't ever see why he wants to torment Masamune so. Fujimon is cute, but that's about it. And so on, and so forth. The characters, while entertaining enough at a superficial level, aren't three-dimensional. They're shallow, so they're hard to relate to. And I'm saying this despite my attraction to Masamune and Midori.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake; this anime is not bad. I dragged my feet almost every week, but I was mildly entertained by every episode. Having two eye candy characters helped. But the flat characters, lack of depth, and disorganized storyline really detracted from my experience. (And yes, the fujobait bothered me, but not as much as those other issues.) I don't feel like this anime has changed me or taught me anything. Not to mention, the only thing I looked forward to all season--Hotaru confessing she's a girl--never happened. It's not a bad anime, but it's not very good either, by my standards. It's just average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 5/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Not really. But it's entertaining, if you have some time to kill.",

            "content": "I've seen a pretty mixed bag with reviews of this show, and I thought I'd give it my two cents as well.\r\nStory 8/10- It initially drew me in because of the whole Ouran-esque premise of the cross dressing, the host club, etc. However, that really only is in the first few episodes. After that, the story revolves around the three main characters forming and team and playing survival games. I don't really have an issue with this, other than the fact that the ending was pretty bad, and didn't match the quality of the rest of the show. It left me with a lot ofunanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- The reason I picked up this show was because I saw it on MAL and thought Tachibana looked cool. The art really appealed to me, and scenes in forests and stuff are really beautiful. Character designs were also well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 - I finished watching this a while ago, so I can't really remember the sound. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that memorable. There was some spunky music thrown in at the action scenes, and it got the job done. The voice acting was pretty good, I especially liked Yukimura's monotone and slightly creepy voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10- The actual characters were good. Tachibana tends to talk about herself in the third person, but it wasn't annoying, and some people even think it's cute. Yukimura was my personal favourite. Masamune was the typical cool guy, and the other characters like Midori and his team were fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that we get a bit of a backstory from Yukimura and also (kind of ) Masamune and Midori. Tachibana doesn't really get a backstory, and they never explain why she is so obsessed with justice. While watching the series, it didn't bother me, but after finishing it and thinking it about it, it kind of did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It was super hilarious, and made me binge watch the short 12 episodes one ofter the other. Give this a chance even if you don't really like the premise of survival games. At first, I didn't really think I would like it, but I loved it! And this is coming from someone who doesn't even like sports anime that much. This was probably my personal favourite from Summer 2015.",

            "content": "When I watched this show I was actually expecting to be the generic action series but with  a gender bend character or lets say a trap as the main character. A trap is nowadays common in the anime industry, but does that mean they're bad? Not exactly. But then again Im talking about the show not the trap itself. We're talking about the show. Anyway Aoharu x Kikanjuu might be one of those series that people would either drop because of its generic synopsis or watch because of the story and progression.\r\nLet's begin. Before I start I might spoil somethings out in the anime,so if you're not watching the series I would suggest to look at another review. Leaving you guys with that warning for the series, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To Start off, the story is quite simple to even understand and makes you set in the mind that this is going to be a survival game series, where people shoot with guns. But. They don't die. At first yes it was to actually pay the stuff, but then it turns into something else. The series consists into progression and building up the tension, which for me was a very good idea considering before going towards the big guns you need to add some build up and training. This is what the show was doing at the first half. Then later on the big guns came, but to be honest for me at some points in the fights it felt a bit underwhelming but at the same time at some areas it feels and looks very hyped. Don't get me wrong I love hyped stuff, but at some points it feels a bit moreso disappointing. For me my big issue with the anime is that they went to this cliche kind of ending. What cliche ending? Friendship. You see, this type of ending is not terrible, its just that its moreso disappointing for me as a follower of the series this season, and I was expecting something more from it. Unfortunately that happens a some points for me. Is the story bad? Not exactly. Its not terrible but its not as a OMG series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well the series has some sort of good characters. To be precise the characters for me were okay characterized and a bit developed, for the main cast at the very least. They have very nice personalities that makes me love them a lot. Especially Yukimura (the guy's VA is Yoshitsugu Matsuoka aka Kirito and Sora) which he's like a pervert type of character and mangaka artist. \\n\\n\r\nMattsun also is a good character, at least to an extension. I was curious about his backstory no doubt, and also about his personality and development made me love him more. However at some points I have to get a bit of a see saw. In other words his right and wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFinally Hotarou, the main protagonist. She's one of those couple of characters that do not go to damsel in distress treatment at least. Usually in anime, female characters are treated as a weak character trope. Thats not a bad thing to my eyes depending on how they're used. In here Hotarou can defend herself at points where I want to cheer for her, she also has this bloodlust which makes her sadistic, which is why it makes me love her more. She's well skilled and such ends. But my issue with her was, remember when I said about the ending being disappointing a bit? well... she didn't told them that she was a girl at the end. Which makes me feel desperated. But does that mean she's a bad character? No. She's a good female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters took a role for a couple of episodes or at least most of the entire series, a few were left thrown aside to my perspective which was a damn shame to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: This show is made by Brain Base, the studio that made shows such as Mawaru Penguindrum and my favorite OVA series Mazinkaiser. Of course, this series has a lot of bright colors and nice way to blend with scenarios. Its not like the best art I've seen like Mawaru where you see a lot of artistic ways, but it looks enough to get at least a 7. Animation as well is the big part of this. It feels at times fluid and mobility, it also gives the viewer a sense of hype as well. At bit of points yes, there were some choppy scenes, but not to the point of a ground breaking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:  Now this is the strongest point of the anime series. This series consists into three phrases: Very good sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack. When it comes to these scenarios I will say they nailed everything right on this one, especially with the sound effects. It just gives you chills at your spine and a lot of tension can be heard around here and there. The Voice acting fits perfectly to their character traits and they match so much that it makes me applaud them more. The soundtrack would be either ominous and at some points rock style. Some have different ways of course, but to me they sound and match well with the scenarios. For the Opening and Ending they're catchy as a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with bits of its faults I personally think that you can actually enjoy this show, heck if I enjoyed it, why can't you? it has a lot to offer but a few that leaves like a sad faces.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is one of the few series that I personally would recommend, even if you are not a fan of these, give it a shot at least. Who knows you might like it.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu proves yet again how easy it is to take an interesting idea and stuff it full of unnecessary complications.\r\nStory and Characters:\r\nThe story starts as Tachibana (actually a girl) mistakenly accuses a guy of seducing his, I mean her, friend. As compensation he has her join his airsoft team. Other than the strange fact that Tachibana never cares to correct people as to her gender, everything starts out okay. But this later becomes an unnecessarily large conflict when it's state the team MC join doesn't take girls. \r\nUnfortunately the show becomes less about airsoft and more about the ridiculous drama and conflict betweenMC's team, Toy Gun Gun, and another team Hoshishiro. The airsoft battles are okay, but you'd expect more in the way of strategy. The show draws little actual interest towards airsoft, which is surprising given that it's the main reason most people would pick up the show\\n\\n\r\nEveryone takes their games seriously. Way too seriously actually. It's stated in episode 1. No training or skill is shown and it actually makes the viewers take it less seriously. As You'll find that the characters are simply a fujo's wet dream, with a neet homo manga writer, a guy who works at a host club, a sadist, and finally a boy who's not really a boy who ties it all together. \\n\\n\r\nThe strangest thing is Tachibana's sense of \"justice\". It's never really explained where this comes from though he mentions it frequently, and it's outright thrown out the window and turns into simply being her self-admitted selfishness later on. So it's just his own little meaningless character trait. The characters aren't good, and neither is the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBrain's Base put a lot into this and you can tell. Unfortunately for them it doesn't look like they'll get much out of it as preorder sales are abysmal. It would be more appropriate if they threw their money at making season 2s for their actual successes, even if they may not sell as well a the first, rather than throwing all their money into such a poor story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed this series for around the first 6 episodes. It was a bit silly but it was fun to watch. But towards the latter half too much dumbly written drama and poorly attempted characterization came into play and it was hardly about the airsoft. I just wanted it to end.\\n\\n\r\nIt wish I would've been able to end the season saying this is a show I didn't regret watching because it seemed that way when I started. It proved that you can't pander to multiple crowds at different ends of the spectrum and get positive recognition. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully I never again have to write a review in which I spend more time correcting \"his/he\" to \"her/she\" again.  If you want a show about actual airsoft, this isn't it.",

            "content": "I'm Japanese so I noticed but, uhhhh, I hate to break this to you all but the title of the anime is subbed wrong. It's actually called Seishunn X Kikanjuu, Say-Shun. Seishunn (\u9752\u6625\uff09means adolescence. The direct/Khun Yomi pronunciation of seishunn (\u9752\u6625) is Ao Haru because ao--> \u9752 means blue and \u6625\u30fc\uff1e means spring as in the season. BTW aoHaru don't make sense in Japanese and it's not a word. So the translators did a bad job subbing the title. Makes sense right? because Tachibana(the MC) is still like around 16~17 meaning She's still in her adolescent age. And throughout the story she is introduced withthe survival games which involves machine guns and all that stuff, which directly connects to a part of the title of this anime which is \"Kikanjuu\" (machine gun).  The plot was decent 8/10, characters were fine7/10, the cliffhanger in the end was disappointing but you're gonna get over it if you read the rest of it in the manga. Where at one point she reveals her secret. (trust me, it's the most satisfying thing ever) I typically fine anime that involves guns fun to watch so this one's in my good list. But I can't say that it's in one of my favorites list. At one point in the anime the MC showed some personality that doesn't belong to her. Like as if she has 2 personalities. But I guess thats what makes the anime a bit spicy.",

            "content": "There comes a time in every anime viewers life when they come across something seemingly unique and are compelled to watch it. Either through stunning visuals, or an interesting synopsis, we dive into an anime world knowing full well it might just end up being 'meh.' Right, so here I arrive with this anime, Aoharu x Kikanjuu.\r\nStory: It was a 'good' story. The whole premise of them becoming the best in Japan at survival games was interesting, and kept me in it for the long run. What I didn't like is how they kept speeding things up further than they'd need to, they squished alot into one 12 episode anime leaving me somewhat unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Possibly the strongest point this anime had. The action scenes were what kept me watching this, and the creepy close up shots on many of the characters faces made the show have stunning visuals (like I said above). The designs of characters and more specifically the secondary characters uniforms were really cool. I mean, it wasn't gurren lagann level of fantastic art, but it was really SHINY.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound felt out of place to be honest, there was too much elevator music. It's literally what you would of listened to waiting to get to the floor of your hotel room. It seemed too jazzy for the show, as no one really had a jazzy personality. Not even Mattsun had that spunky of a personality. The music didn't match the story. Regarding the intro song, it was fun to listen to. So the whole soundtrack wasn't a whole miss. And it wasn't making my ears fall off or anything. The voices were just okay. I thought midori's voice did a good job highlighting him being very sadistic and Yukki's voice matching him as being pretty dull/interested in perverted things.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nI kind of wish this was a shounen-ai so instead of deliberately hiding that the main character is a girl most of the show, they'd of just had her as a him. The main 'girl' is pretty unfeminine and looks more like a uke to me. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like that the main character is a justice freak, well, you'll have a ball, but she falls a little flat in development. Not just physical (budum bum).\\n\r\nI liked the dynamics between the secondary character team and the first, but the characters really weren't developed  any further than just being a tool to the action of the story and humor. It was ALL about the survival games and the friendship that made no sense to of been made (besides sharing an interest) and the loss of friendship. If you're okay with characters having no individuality past being 'sadistic' 'masochistic' 'bloodthirsty,' or 'mundane' then I guess you can watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't a BAD show by any means. It had great action, the art was spectacular, and it COULD be interesting at times. So it's a good action story that doesn't take up much time, and it's about a game that some of us play, and the passion that comes with it. I guess don't knock it till you try it?\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW:\r\nIf you are looking for a short, funny and enjoyable anime, with simple art and nice backgrounds, you should consider watching this anime. \r\nStory (6 out of 10): The beginning may seem like Ouran Host Club, but that's really just the first episode. The story revolves about a high school girl Tachibana Hotaru, who got drawn into the world of survival games by her two neighbours to repay a debt - the twist is that her two team-mates don't know that she's a girl (girls are forbidden in their team). \r\nIf you want an anime with a deep and spectacular story, this mightnot be the anime. Don't get me wrong, I loved the story and it's quite simple and enjoyable. It was funny and the ending was great (somehow, the endings in anime always disappoint me, but this wasn't really the case). Although I would have liked to see a few more action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) and sound (9): The art was great and simple (just as I like it). The characters were nicely drawn and I loved the backgrounds. The sound effects weren't overused, as they are in many anime and the music was also great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7 out od 10): Each character was different and had it's own personality. They were enjoyable and funny and I can't decide on my favourite one. As the series progresses, you find out more about them. But they didn't really develop, this is where the anime lacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10 out of 10): Why did I give it such a score? It's funny, it's simple and perfect for a short casual watching. It certainly didn't dissapoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As I said, it's one of my favourites anime. It's simple, short and interesting, with likable characters and great music. You find yourself laughing every episode. I really hope for a second season. While the anime isn't deep, or spectacular, it's really really  enjoyable, so I'm giving it a 9.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is a fantastic anime. It is an awesome gender bender, an awesome sports anime, and an awesome friendship story. I feel like a lot of people ended up not liking this anime because they based their opinions off of the first two episodes and then were shocked with the turn it made once it really started in the 3rd ep. I want to clarify-- this is not Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns. There IS a host club in the beginning, there IS a girl who wears pants instead of a skirt, she DOES break something and initially is forcedto play on a team to repay her debts, and yes they mistake her as a dude. But this doesn't matter. After the 3rd ep, none of that matters because the beginning was just a quick means to introduce the main character to survival games (aka paintball with beebee guns). I'm not happy with how they did this or how they rushed it, but couldn't be bothered to care too much about it after I got to the amazing main plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy dramatic sports animes with a slightly darker overtone, hilarious moments, and an emphasis on friendship, then this is for you. I was surprisingly entertained and excited about an anime about survival games. If you like paintball like I do, you'll probably be pretty thrilled since you never thought there'd be a paintball anime. But like any sports anime, it's dramatic. Sometimes it's hilariously dramatic, sometimes it's seriously, heart-string pulling dramatic, either way it's dramatic in a good way. What I really enjoyed about this story is that it progresses basically like it would if it were a male protagonist. She trains to get better, she sucks at first, but has great potential, and is determined to get better for herself and for her team. I really enjoyed this aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice, it's new style, it's smooth. Nothing really stood out to me regarding the animation, besides an occasional really sweet angle. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is fantastic. The song gets you pumped up, the animation really suits the song and gives it a darker feel, and it's sung by the voice actors of the three main characters which is always a good +1. I thought the soundtrack of the whole anime was pretty good. They're really good at pumping you up during battle scenes and at important moments, but I felt that their weakest link here was during the softer moments in the anime. They're really good at battle sequences, but during downtimes and more heart-felt moments, the music was either a little bland or just plain forgettable. I felt like they could have done better during these moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the characters. Without trying to spoil anything:\\n\\n\r\nMatsuoka is a host in all the best ways. He's attentive, a good listener, and also caring to a fault. As a captain of the survival team Toy Gun Gun, he successfully utilizes these skills to bring out the potential of his teammates. As a character, he's very well-done. The more you watch, the more layers you see of him, the more you find out why he acts the way he does, and the more you find out just how much they thought about his underlying personality. He's a great example of a well-developed and well-written character that can be both strong and sensitive. \\n\\n\r\nYukimura is hilarious. Yukimura is a hentai mangaka with racy tastes, and isn't afraid to show it. He's the type who would creepily sit in a corner reading porn magazines. He's also a first class survival gamer. Pretty early on you find out that he has a dark past that's led him to only trusting and relying on Matsuoka (Matsuoka also has a dark past that's been touched on in the anime but hasn't fully been disclosed yet). He brings this obsession with Matsuoka into the survival games, playing as a sniper who always has his back. Yukimura undergoes some amazing character development throughout the show. I won't go into details, but I'll just say it was nice seeing him become more trusting and also more independent as the show went on.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to take a moment to say that the side and supporting characters were also interesting and nicely developed. For example, the \"evil\" team Toy Gun Gun is fighting against has striking characters who will quickly become either your favorites or your most hated. And then they'll be developed a bit more, and your view will quickly change from black and white to grey. I can't wait to see how these side and supporting characters will continue to develop in season 2 (really hoping for a second season).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the main character. I could write a whole research paper on why Tachibana, Hotaru is such a good and necessary character. It's so refreshing to see a sports anime with a female lead who's actually treated like a proper main character. Tachibana is like a classic shounen lead: she's all about justice, likes to battle people who go against her sense of justice, and is athletically talented. She's also extremely naive at first and a little oblivious. But through a misunderstanding and a journey of self-discovery and friendship, she learns what and who she's fighting for. In the end, she matures into an even more amazing, and hilarious, lead who I hope to see develop even more in the future. For a shounen, this is a standard character setup. But for a female protagonist, this is anything but. Like \"Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit\", she is a physically strong protagonist who isn't afraid to show both her femininity and masculinity, holds her own against her male teammates, and is proud of being herself in all that that entails. She doesn't consider females weak, and she doesn't consider males strong. She believes in herself and her strength as Tachibana, Hotaru, just as she believes in Matsuoka and Yukimura's strength as her teammates. She is a valuable member of Toy Gun Gun and is, eventually, treated like a valuable member. Knowing both her strengths and her weaknesses, Matsuoka recognizes just how amazing Tachibana is, and just how amazing she could become. It is so exciting to see a female lead like Tachibana in a medium so devoid of well-written female protagonists (without a story solely focused on a love interest). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this anime. It was hilarious, it was thrilling, it was heart-warming, it was refreshing-- I can't say enough good things about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved this anime to death, there were some shortcomings regarding the first 2 episodes. Despite that, the anime was still a fantastic watch. \\n\r\nI would not recommend this to people expecting Ouran High School Host Club, people who're just in it for action and guns, people who want Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns, or people who're expecting a weak, moe female lead holding a large gun. \\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to people who enjoy sports animes, well-done gender bends, comedies, and heart-felt friendships.",

            "content": "Overall rating: 8.2/10 \r\nA lot of people might compare this series to Ouran High School Host Club, for the reason that one of the main characters is a host. However, the focus of AoHaru x Kikanjuu is on survival games--not on a host club. Instead, it focus on three characters and how survival games contributes to their progress throughout the series (and beyond): Hotaru Tachibana, Masamune Matsuoka and Tooru Yukimura--the members of a survival game team, Toy Gun Gun. (Yes, I know what you might be thinking: their naming sense can definitely improve...) \r\n***Just a warning: What I mention in my review can be consideredas potential spoilers (as I talked about what happened in certain episodes, mostly the beginning, for this section), so please keep that in mind. Of course, I'll try to limit the spoilers, when I can. Also, just to note, my review is more or so formatted as such: some explained events mixed with the points that stood out to me.***\\n\\n\r\nThe story of AoHaru x Kikanjuu starts off with Hotaru, a girl who looks and dresses like a boy, meeting her neighbor, Masamune Matsuoka, while he's talking on the phone outside of her apartment. Hotaru couldn't think of another way to make him move, so she slammed her fist on the door, causing Matsuoka-san to stop what he's doing. Just before Hotaru went into her apartment, there was a gun lying on the ground, and to her surprise, it's Matsuoka-san's. The next day, after talking to her friend, who was greeted by Matsuoka-san earlier, she found out that he worked at a host club and that the gun that she saw is actually a toy gun. Matsuoka-san then challenged Hotaru to a survival game, and having confidence in hers skills, she accepted. While her physical abilities is something to watch out for, she ended up losing to Matsuoka-san's experience and skill in survival game fighting. The condition that Matsuoka-san have for her loss was: to join his survival game team for paying off her debt of the damage she caused in the host club (while playing the game). Matsuoka-san is indeed a sly one... \\n\\n\r\nDespite not wanting to play survival games at first, Hotaru grew to really like them--to the point where she was at a loss for having to even consider not playing them at all. It was Yukimura, the other member of Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined (who writes a specific genre of manga) made her realize this, by pointing out to her: \"...now you've tasted the air of the battlefield. You can't go back to an ordinary life.\" What drew Hotaru towards survival games was the sense of fighting that the players engage in. Hotaru have a strong sense of justice, and with that justice, it can turn to having an unyielding (and sometimes, even bloodthirsty) desire to take down whoever she's going up against, and it shows in how she plays during survival games. Although Hotaru does not have the best survival game sense, she does withhold a strong fighting spirit; on top of that, she's armed with her (almost superhuman-like) strength. During a battle, her opponents could even sense her aura of bloodthirst in the atmosphere surrounding her, and that's why she's someone to watch out for during a survival game. \\n\\n\r\nHotaru is a character that I found easy to like, and wanting to cheer for. She's strong and can fight for herself, but at the same time, since she doesn't have as much life experiences as the other two main characters (who have their dark pasts that can weigh them down), she's not one that is quick to understand why certain characters act the way they do, and why certain events turn out the way it does. Although, that's understandable, because for most instances, if you don't know much about something, it's difficult for you to comprehend just what is going on. It's refreshing, yet awesome to see a female, especially lead character, who can hold her own and is willing to fight on her own--even though she might not do it very well at particular times. \\n\\n\r\nThrough each experience Hotaru came across, primarily as being involved with survival games and the members of Toy Gun Gun, she came to better understand not only herself, but also those around her. The development between characters occurred mostly through the conversations they have with each other, and what they learn and come to think because of them. First of all: Yukimura. Yukimura, upon first meeting him, seems to be an introverted, distant and unwelcoming person; however, that's due to the fact that he knows firsthand just how it's like to be betrayed by those he thought were his friends. After getting to know Hotaru, he found it not as difficult to be less closed up, and more willing to adjust how he approaches matters. As the series went on, with the more development Yukimura had, the more likable I found him to be. Yukimura can be serious, when trying to help with the situation at hand--or to just simply trying help out, but at the same time, he can also be undeniably adorable, in what he says, in the way that he talks, and in what he does. Onto Kanae: whenever she sees Hotaru not as herself, she would ask if she's okay, and that if anything's bothering her. In an instance where Hotaru seemed so obviously unmotivated, Kanae did something to help her pick herself up. She even recalled something that Hotaru told her a while ago, when her team was about to give up before they even play a match during physical education class: \"I never thought about winning making me cool, or losing making me uncool. ... If anything... Giving up before you even try is kind of uncool. That's why I want to be someone who'll fight as many times as it takes, and never give up. That's got to be way cooler.\" Remembering such specific words just shows how much she values Hotaru as a friend, how much she cares for her friends' wellbeing and overall, how great of a friend she truly is. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art of the show certain adds to the intensity of particular scenes, and it's what makes the show so exciting to watch. During the fight scenes, to compliment the expressions, a darker shade of color palate would be used to present the characters' faces and certain music would be played to enhance the tension in the air. As a result, all the fight scenes captured my attention, as somehow, I always found myself wanting to see how the characters engage each other in all different sorts of battle scenarios, whether it's: close-range, far-range, near the flag area, one on one, snipping from afar, and so on.  It's also very fascinating to watch how others react and act to the vibe that Hotaru gives off, as well as her quick movements that catches them off-guard.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an outstanding job in voice acting their characters. I especially like the voice of Hotaru; the voice that Mikako Komatsu (aka Neko from K Project, Ginger from Gangsta, etc) used for Hotaru is boyish, so it helps in convincing the other characters that she's a boy. It doesn't sound forced, in fact, it comes off as quite natural and clear. The voice that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (who also voiced many other characters, such as Kirito from SAO, Souma from SnS, Kanemaru from DnA, etc), Yukimura's voice actor, used for Yukimura was really fitting for his character. His low and quiet way of speaking represents Yukimura as a character well. The voice actors also did a great job in singing the Opening and Ending songs; I personally like the Ending songs more (both Tic Tac and Gunjou Survival), as I find Mikako Komatsu's voice to be very fitting with the songs that she was given to sing. \\n\\n\r\n***(This section leads to more major spoilers, so read on only if you've finished watching the series!)***\\n\r\nMatsuoka-san said something to Hotaru before they began the first game they played with each other, and that is: \"Let's start this deathless death march.\" Now looking back and thinking about all of the games that they played, this line definitely held significance all throughout the series. When watching the episodes, where the characters takes the games so seriously, you might be thinking: ...but it's just a game. While that's true, it does shine light on many aspects in life. Yes, getting shot by a toy gun does not secure your death outside of the survival games, although it's possible for you to get injured from participating in them. Here's the thing: All the events that took place were, in one way or another, in relation to the survival games. The games reflected the possible outcomes of what can happen in real life-and-death situations, where people's lives can actually be at stake. An example of this could be: the opponent's got you cornered and the only options are: to 1. be shot, or 2. surrender. The line emphasize just how survival games with toy guns can shine light on real survival fights, with real guns, or even: invisible--not detectable by the eyes--kind of guns. For each person, the gun(s) that can \"shoot\" through them differs. With that said, most of the \"guns\" that leaves wounds and unforgettable scars are ones that are able to \"shoot\" into people's minds, and eventually, into their hearts. And with this series, it's clear that it's the invisible, not easily detected ones--at least not at first glance--that leaves impactful impressions on characters. You could infer so with the unraveling of how each character think and act because of the past experiences (and for some, traumas) that they've endured--especially for Matsuoka-san. \\n\\n\r\n\"There are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. I've always been the latter.\" The \"shot\" that have been fired deep within Matsuoka-san was this: all the people that let go of him so far in his life. He never reached out towards any of them, even though he could've; instead, he just watch them leave, because he thinks that if he tries to reach out, he might really push them away for good. So, before Hotaru could take her leave, Matsuoka-san pushed her away by kicking her off the team, after Toy Gun Gun lost to Midori and his team. He didn't want her to hate survival games, and eventually, hate him for making her hate the games in the first place. For once, Yukimura didn't agree with what Matsun decided, and chose to not follow him on this decision. So, to help clear up the misunderstandings, he told Hotaru about the members that left Toy Gun Gun because of Matsuoka and his baggage with survival games--which led them to turn their backs on him. \\n\\n\r\nAs a response to Matsuoka's decision, Hotaru challenged him to a survival game, and that if she wins, he'll have to say something that she wants him to say. Hotaru kept losing, but her determination propelled her to keep trying. It eventually led him to ask the real question to himself: \"Why won't you abandon me?\"--as all those that left him did. Seeing Hotaru's persistency and earnestness on trying to win, made Matsuoka-san see just how much she is trying to reach out to him--the way that he didn't, the way that he was afraid to, the way that he wanted to--for others. It also opened his eyes: that she wants him to take and accept her hand and that Hotaru isn't someone that he can shake off that easily. There are people who just can't bring themselves to let go, even if they were told to do so and even if they think they should--especially if they see the other person in pain, suffering, unable to move forward; Hotaru is absolutely one of them. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps Hotaru's determination and earnestness made Matsun start to see more of how others feel around him too, not just how he feels about them (as he can really get too wrapped inside his own head). To express his thoughts on Yukimura opposing him, he smiled, while telling him: \"Thanks for getting mad at me.\" \\n\\n\r\nBoth Yukimura and Hotaru managed to knock some sense into Matsuoka-san in the end; that's what they set out to do--and from the looks of it, they are getting better at doing so too. (Keep it up, because there's no others that can keep him in check...) \\n\r\n***(Spoilers section over.)***\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu very much; it's one of the shows that got me the most hyped for the next episodes--and during the summers season as a whole. ^.^ \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to fans of: Bishounens, Friendships, Action, Comedy, Shounen, and a show that have a strong female lead--along with great supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n***",

            "content": "A surprisingly enjoyable series that is less plot driven and more character driven. The story wasn't terrible but it also wouldn't have been as engaging had it not been for its wonderfully interesting cast of characters. While I found Hotaru extremely off-putting initially, especially her use of illeism, eventually I grew to tolerate her and even found her somewhat endearing by the finale. Others I loved right off the bat: Yukki and Fujimon are hands down my favorites. One I can relate to so well, the other is basically a giant puppy. \r\nYou pick up early on that AxK thrives on being extreme. At times,it's almost ridiculous how much weight they give the survival games and it teeters at the edge of being overly dramatic. The characters as well, while lovable, are also very predictable in terms of personality-types. What I wasn't expecting was how greatly exaggerated the character personalities were going to be. \\n\\n\r\nI consider the art a fitting style for AxK. The animation, coloring, lighting, everything looks gorgeous and is definitely one of the best I've seen recently. I'm especially a fan of the scenes when Hotaru lets out bloodlust - again, an example of how this series takes everything over the top, but I say this with an amused fondness. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a heartwarming, very emotional season finale that made me go \"d'awwww\" for several minutes. I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed for as season 2 as there were still several plot points that were briefly touched upon but never fully explored.",

            "content": "Eleventh Review....Aoharu x Kikanjuu! \r\nThis series was introduced to me by a good friend of mine, she knew the type of anime that I am into so she suggested I watch this one. About a Girl pretending to be a Boy in order to be on a Shooting Team - Toy Gun Gun. \r\nAt first I was a bit iffy in the idea that the girl pretends to be a boy, however I watched the first episode together with my friend and I absolutely loved it. I loved the fact that Hotaru (The Main Character) still has her friend and it shows us a bitof her everyday life before getting straight into the main event. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was well designed, about a tournament between Gun Shooting (Pretty much BB Pellets) and this team that Hotaru finds herself in. I really got into the story and enjoyed the series a lot, once I had watched a few more episodes I was really finding myself amused. The more the story picks up the more you are wanting to understand what had happened with Team Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined. It has it's serious elements but the series also has it's funny elements to keep you awake and not bored. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was a favourite of mine, it was well developed and well put together, especially within the fights. The way that they produced the battlegrounds was also a nice sight and it shown a lot of detail that had went in to the story board of the scenes. Sound was also a good element, they had a nice range of instrumental music throughout and the opening was very well played. The sound made more of the battles come to life and gets you really into it and picks your interests up as the fight carries on, puttign you on edge. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was very well introduced into this show, for Hotaru being the main character she was introduced straight away as one of these Tom Boys that like to protect the 'Princesses' and this made the main character even more enjoyable to watch. The next two main characters were Masamune and Tooru, these characters to me looked like a very nice pair that worked well together, they were a combined team of specialist tactics and this made them perform together a well developed character point. There is much unknown about these characters but as the story goes on the truth is unraveled and it slowly reveals their past and how it all ties together with the tournament. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I have and I am proud to say that now having completed this it is one of my favourites. It was very enjoyable to watch and it was also at some points emotional. It keeps you hooked into the series in order to find out what happens and what the end outcome is. I actually was quite happy with how the anime turned out and how well it was put together, I loved the idea and concept of a Gun Battle and the character developments made this even more interesting to carry on watching. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. This could totally be turned into a Yuri/Yaoi haha! \\n\\n\r\n~ Canaan\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler* \\n\r\nWas upset that at the end of the series she still never mentioned that she is a she and not actually a he, so hoping for a second season at least for a follow up.",

            "content": "I don't think I've ever seen an anime with as many blatant plot holes and as much inconsistent writing as Aoharu x Kikanjuu. Now that doesn't mean it's the worst anime ever made (it definitely isn't), but it has a huge amount of wasted potential due to its weak story, horrendous characterization, and the fact that the author is seemingly completely clueless about how airsoft works.\r\nInitially the anime feels like something quite similar to Ouran Koukou Host Club as the protagonist is a girl (Tachibana Hotaru) crossdressing as a boy who ends up becoming indebted to a popular guy (Matsuoka Masamune) who works as ahost in the city. This notion is then quickly proven highly inaccurate as Matsuoka forces Tachibana to come join his \"survival game\" team and participate alongside him in an upcoming tournament. I say survival game, but that in and of itself is completely wrong; it's actually just competitive airsoft that we're talking about here. I don't know if it's a mistranslation or whatnot but either way if you're expecting some sort of thrilling life-or-death drama here you're going to be sorely disappointed because there is absolutely nothing lethal in this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what exactly is it that makes Aoharu x Kikanjuu such a trainwreck then? Well there are many reasons but they can be roughly divided into three categories:\\n\\n\r\n1. The plot\\n\r\nThe writing for this anime is bad. Terribly bad. The games themselves make no sense whatsoever (more on that later), but even ignoring that part the overall plot progression is simply all over the place. Initially, Tachibana thinks the airsoft games are childish and stupid. Then after playing *one* game she suddenly thinks they're the greatest thing ever and has become a full-blown addict. Sounds believable, right? Oh and you know how she originally joined the team because of a debt? Yeah that plot element is just handwaved away in a split second as if it never existed to begin with, completely ruining the entire premise of the story, yet it just keeps on going as if nothing ever happened.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also all kinds of forced drama which feel completely unnecessary, totally out of place, and oftentimes insanely predictable. Time skips are pulled haphazardly which renders the pacing very inconsistent, and above all, there seems to be no semblance of coherence in the writing whatsoever. Let me just describe a certain scene from episode two here in order to make an example (minor spoilers I guess, but certainly nothing important): there is a segment where Tachibana is surrounded by her three opponents at only a few meters range. Then in the next second they're suddenly all standing on the same side of her, yelling \"corner her!\", as if implying that they hadn't already cornered her a second ago? Immediately thereafter, Tachibana's teammate suddenly appears next to her and they have a loud conversation for about two minutes. What happened to their opponents? They were standing right next to her just a moment ago! How could they possibly have lost track of her, let alone be outside hearing range? I mean seriously just what happened here, did the producers accidentally put the scenes in the wrong order or something? These kinds of elementary mistakes should be impossible to make. It's so blatantly illogical it feels like it was written by a 12-year-old.\\n\\n\r\n2. The characters\\n\r\nAoharu x Kikanjuu is pretty blatant fujoshi bait; that much is obvious from the get-go, but even so the character cast is still a disaster. First of all, we have our main character Tachibana Hotaru. Mother of god is she annoying. About once per minute she has to remind the audience that despite her appearance she's actually a girl, she's always referring to herself in third-person and her sole personality trait is seemingly that she firmly believes in \"justice\". Yeah justice; hence why she goes completely berserk when playing airsoft and behaves like an uncontrollable animal; sounds just like a knight in shining armor, doesn't she? In the first place what does justice have to do with playing games? Are your opponents supposed to be \"evil\" just because they're playing or something? In that case Tachibana is obviously equally guilty of that crime. There's also the obnoxious truth that despite being a really bad player, Tachibana always ends up spontaneously gaining super powers whenever the plot feels like it, solely for the sake of convenience. The anime never shuts up about her so-called \"bloodlust\" which is the ability she uses to magically paralyze her opponents just by looking at them and make them cower in fear, as well as enable her to run faster than a speeding bullet. But there's nothing supernatural about this or anything, it's just her \"talent\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the rest of the characters in this show goes (essentially all male), they're basically all cardboard cutouts as well. Matsuoka is the typical noble bishounen with a \"dark past\", Yukimura (the third team member) is quiet, depressive and honestly kind of creepy, and then there's the overly-generic villain Midori who's just an all-round douchebag that enjoys hurting people. They all feel like they're solely there for the sake of being there, but without much thought put into it whatsoever. And the way they behave towards each other is completely unnatural. At one moment Matsuoka is almost pissing himself with fear just by looking at Midori, and in the next he's being super cocky and confident. Again, consistency please. There are also quite a lot of soft Yaoi vibes every here and there throughout the show, which I guess is to be expected given the fujoshi pandering but it still feels very out of place story-wise.\\n\\n\r\n3. The \"survival games\"\\n\r\nEverything I've stated above is certainly problematic, but without a doubt the nail in the coffin is the execution of the so-called \"survival games\" themselves. Honestly I don't think the author has ever played airsoft before, or even studied up on how it works properly. I'm going to be very direct here: airsoft is primarily a game of tactics, stealth and precision. It's a game where you attempt to predict the opposing team's moves ahead of time, try to hide and ambush them by sniping them from the shadows, etcetera. I don't even think you need to have played the game before to understand that much. So what does Aoharu x Kikanjuu do then? Well... it basically treats airsoft like a battle shounen.\\n\\n\r\nDo you know what you do with guns? You shoot each other with them. Yeah right, not in this anime; here you avoid using them, charge straight down the barrel of your opponent's rifle, *paralyze* him with fear just by looking at him and thus render him incapable of pulling the trigger, then run into melee range and finally bludgeon the guy by using your submachine gun as a club. Excellent work Tachibana; you were even able to outplay the guy using a freaking minigun by using this incredible strategy! Truly a job well done. While we're at it we should start teaching the military that there's no need for guerilla warfare any longer; simply running up to your enemies and punching them in the face sounds like a much more humane way of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that's far from the only problem when it comes to how these games play out. People refusing to shoot when they have their opponents in their sights for no apparent reason, people having to hold clich\u00e9 speeches and punchlines before pulling the trigger, people revealing their positions completely needlessly in order to have a \"fair fight\" with their opponent instead of just shooting them from cover, etcetera. The list goes on. Even more disturbing though, these games are seemingly completely unmonitored. Despite playing in a high stakes tournament, there are no cameras or anything inside the woodland battlefield. In other words there's barely even any point of having rules for this game; you could basically cheat as much as you'd like and no one will ever know. But I guess that's just another plot hole which we shouldn't think too much about and instead just pretend it isn't there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo with all that said, is there anything good thing about this show? Well if there's one thing it'd be that despite everything it at least isn't boring. Incredibly annoying yes, but twenty minutes of Aoharu x Kikanjuu per week was not really a problem. It's kind of like watching a very low level football game; even if the content itself is lackluster, you can still probably find some enjoyment in it just by being a football fan to begin with. In the same way, despite the cringeworthy execution, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is so far the only anime I've ever seen about airsoft, so it gets some plus points for originality and for having a fun concept at least. But even with that taken into account it doesn't change the fact that it is still a very sub-par anime at best, and not one I would particularly recommend to very many people.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is a action, comedy, shounen genre anime about a girl named Tachibana Hotaru mistaken for a boy. This anime has personally exceeded my original expectations since the first episode. Just a quick warning this is my first review. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story mainly follows Tachibana Hotaru's point of view. The episodes have a smooth flow in them, it always kept me on my toes(engaged) and loves making me scream at the screen for another episode. As everyone might know this anime is being compared to 'Ouran High School Host Club\u2019 and I have to say I agree. Aoharu x Kikanjuu really does havethat Ouran feel but since there two complete different anime\u2019s don\u2019t expect the same storyline. The storyline is very easy to understand because as the story begins to unravel you can tell where the story will be headed, it was very predictable at times but even so it was still very enjoyable to watch. There is a bit of a rush in some episodes but the story really recovers from those rushes. As you all know this anime is also a comedy anime, this scenes always seemed to make me laugh a lot and it really made my day a whole better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is very not that realistic but it very good to the extent that you can see everything clearly. The animation is unique because it really achieve certain moods throughout the series. I personally think this is the animation that would be the best for Aoharu x Kikanjuu i wouldn\u2019t ask for a better animator. The character designs are very fitting, for example Matsuoka, Masamune is a host they have deliberity made him really hot and his friend Yukimura a very indoors looking character. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the characters were really good they all matched up perfectly. Tachibana Hotaru\u2019s voice actor was really amazing personally because her voice really did sound a lot like a boy\u2019s voice at some points and it really made the character fit in to her role perfectly. The opening to Aoharu x Kikanjuu is great especially how the actual characters are actually singing the opening which makes the voice actors and opening in this anime the more better. If this were to be dubbed I think it wouldn\u2019t be to the standard of the original voice actors. During the scenes that unfolded during the anime, OST\u2019s were played and they all absolutely fitted into the scene and mood and the soundtracks was also one the aspects the exceeded my expectations for this anime, I would love to list to the OST\u2019s if they are released soon. I loved both opening and ending because I just liked the songs that played especially the opening because the voice actors actually sang it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAs every anime has are characters. The characters in Aoharu x Kikanjuu were really well-rounded they all had their strengths and weakness. The characters had the right reaction to every problem that popped up in a realistic way. I can really relate some characters from this anime to other anime\u2019s as well and I have to say they really had some character development, you won\u2019t notice it at first but you will. I would remember all the main characters in this anime because they all had their different personality\u2019s and it was very enjoyable to see them slowly change.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already recommended this anime to many of my friends and it\u2019s been positive feedback from them, how can you not enjoy a anime like this? It keeps you engaged, it makes you laugh and even makes you scream at the screen sometimes. Non-anime fans would probably enjoy this anime and as well as manga fans, anyone any age would. In future I am going to re-watch this anime again because it really makes my day watching it I would skip certain parts but not all of it. It was unique I don\u2019t get this engaged with some anime\u2019s most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 9. To summarise the story is very engaging it keeps you on your toes. The animation really fits in with this anime because it pictures the characters with their personalities really well. The voice actors are just perfect they even sang the opening theme to the anime and you don\u2019t see that much with most anime. The characters really develop during the series at first its not clear but at the end you can see they definitely changed a bit. I enjoyed this very much my friends did too so I think everyone in the whole world basically would too. \\n",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is those stories that may be hit or miss, for some it might be annoying, for others it may be the start of something good.\r\nI fall in the later category.\r\nIt may be annoying because there's no development of characters, for me Tachibana Hotaru is a promising main character, but there is a lack of background story, or intentions, that make her character quite annoying or plain. For example her sense of justice would be enjoyable if there would be a reason behind it, a story to tell us why this character think that way, but, as the story progress, it tell usthat her sense of justice is not what we all think of, hence the lack of explanation. But, Tachibana is also someone who stick to her ideals, values friendship and inspires others to go on; which makes her someone to admire, in some kind of way.\\n\\n\r\nBut, not every character lack a past of some kind, Yukimura is an example, you can watch him grow as a person and actually be fond of him as he helps each of the main characters to do what is right for the team, he has a background that explains his insecurities. Though sometimes his character might be annoying because of the unnecessary ero-anime love he has.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it needs a second season, definitely. There's some parts of it left open that needed explanations. But, for twelve episodes, there's a rush in the story that kills it a bit, Tachibana's love for survival game is an example of it, since it grows from \"I hate this, I just want to pay my debt\" to \"I need to play this game forever, I'm never going to stop\" from one episode to another; also, there's quite the plot hole going on with the antagonists, since there's no reason behind their behaviour. However it also has points to love, for example the friendship between the protagonists that grows with every episode and, also, it kind of surprise that some characters are not what they seem, there's more than meet the eye!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, the colors from certain scenes left me breathless! there's nothing to complain there; also the OST is quite nice, I'm loving the opening song!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend watching it because you may enjoy it, is not an anime for everyone, that's for sure, but you need to be patient with it, also the whole idea of survival game is really refreshing and unique, the art is well done, and the story is not so bad, so why not give it a try? \\n\\n\\n\r\n(ps. sorry for my english)\\n",

            "content": "I first started watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu simply because I thought the art was beautiful. I had no idea what it was about at all.\r\nAnd thus, I can easily say that the art is one of the best points of the series (in my opinion), along with the soundtrack. \r\nAfter the first (few) episodes, I was surprised to see that I actually enjoy a series with 'survival games' as its theme/plot/however to call it.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nIn my opinion, the story itself could be much better if the pace were slower. If the actions, games and such were more detailed, with more depth. \r\nStill, I liked thegeneral idea of the survival games and tournaments and such.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nLike I've mentioned above, the art is the reason I actually started the series and of course, there are many animes with outstanding art, but in my opinion, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of them.\\n\r\nThere were a few scenes where I just sit there, stare at the screen and think 'wow, that's drawn so beautifully'.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI liked the soundtrack - whether we talk about the opening/ending or in-between. It matched whatever was happening and yeah, I simply enjoyed the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nIt would have easily gotten a '10/10' from me if one actually got to know more about all the protagonist (and of course, the other characters as well). I am pretty sure that the characters could have an interesting past, relationship to each other and who-knows-what, but apparently, it's not shown.\\n\r\nThere are many interesting ones and, in my opinion, also quite a few really likable/lovely ones. \\n\r\nSome might turn out weird or the 'development' is kind of... unnatural/too fast, but overall if I thought about 'why did they do that?' the answer/reasoning usually comes to me rather quickly.\\n\r\nAlthough I am sure if one doesn't give much thought about the 'why', the characters might just appear as 'ridiculous'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that I would have marathoned the series if all episodes were out already when I started watching the anime.\\n\r\nThere were still times where it was kind of 'normal'/'slow' compared to the usual pace of the series and some episodes were full of excitement.\\n\r\nIt was funny, sometimes you might even get goosebumps or just excited/anticipating to see what would happen next.\\n\r\nMost of the time, I thought that it was amusing and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThe part which I'm disappointed about is the fact that there was not enough 'character development' and 'story depth'. \\n\r\nAlso, if the series had a few more episodes to spare, I think it would have gotten a lot better (more time for the events, games, characters etc.).\\n\r\nBut apart from that, I still adore most of the characters shown, even the antagonist(s) are fascinating and the mixture of different personalities is interesting.",

            "content": "Blah blah, Ouran High School Host Club, blah blah. I haven't even seen that one, so I don't care and went in expecting nothing. That aside, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of the worst anime I've seen in a long time. I cannot say anything good about this one.\r\nThe story follows main character Hotaru Tachibana, a reverse trap with a strong sense of justice. Hotaru is put under the impression that her friend Kanae was treated badly at this host club she visited. She goes to investigate and gets into a survival game (airsoft gun fight) with the place's owner, Masamune Matsuoka. The place getsdamaged in the process, and Hotaru is forced to join his survival games team, Toy Gun Gun (a really dumb name that they even point out as being dumb), in order to pay off the damages. This ends up just being an excuse to bring Hotaru into survival games as the paying off the damages part is hand waved pretty shortly afterward. Hotaru soon meets Toy Gun Gun's other member Tooru Yukimura. He initially hates her for no reason other than the fact that she's getting between him and \"Mattsun\" (his nickname for Matsuoka). However, he gets over it really quickly, within the course of one episode. After the team is together, they make it their goal to be the best in Japan. At this point, everything is relatively inoffensive, but the one-dimensional cast of characters and relatively unintersting story aren't earning it any points.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime goes downhill very quickly. There are two main conflicts in the show, one of them is incredibly pointless, and the other doesn't really go anywhere. First is the issue of Hotaru's gender. Her teammates (and pretty much everyone who doesn't know her) are under the impression that she's a guy. Not too much of an issue at first glance, but it turns out the Matsuoka doesn't allow girls on his team for reasons that you eventually find out, but it ends up not being something you can more or less figure out way before they actually tell it to you near the end of the series. Ultimately, this does nothing but stir up pointless drama. My issue with this is that they could have easily made Hotaru a boy, and the series would have been exactly the same. The issue of her gender is rarely addressed in a meaningful way. They almost came close in one particularly annoying episode somewhat centered around Kanae in which Hotaru is urged to be more feminine and avoid survival games, but what could have been something to address gender stereotypes in a thought provoking way ends up being nothing more than an episode where Hotaru strengthens her resolve through her friend. It's annoying enough that the point of the episode could have gotten across in a much better way if this was done through Hotaru interacting with her teammates, but it's even more infuriating that Kanae's character was clearly written just so this episode could happen. Her only character trait is that she's a girl with pink hair, and she acts as somewhat of a foil to Hotaru's masculine side. But a foils aren't nearly as effective if you almost never have the two of them interact. Without spoiling anything, the issue of Hotaru's gender never goes anywhere. She says she's going to tell her teammates, then you never see her tell them, so it feels like an annoying tease. To make things more insulting, there's even a scene near the end where Hotaru is grabbing Matsuoka's hand and he starts blushing (after doing no such thing the entire series). The groan I let out at the moment was beyond comprehension. It's almost like they're insulting you. Feels like somekind of really lame yaoi fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe other conflict in the story revolves around Matsuoka and another survival game player named Midori. There's apparently some sort of history between the two of them. But ultimately it boils down to Matsuoka really wants to beat his team in a survival game. Outside of the games, when Midori interacts with Hotaru, he's almost creepily friendly. But during the games he's a terrifying sadist, or at least that's what they make him out to be. There's pretty much nothing interesting about Midori's character other than the fact that the story needed some sort of antagonist, so it's really hard to care about him. He's extremely one dimensional. There's not much else to say about this part of the story without spoiling it, but it ends up involving Matsuoka being tormented by his inferiority to Midori and the results of every big tournament his team lost. This doesn't go anywhere particularly interesting, but it ends up making for some really lame drama.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story's pretty bad. The characters are pretty awful as well. On top of being a reverse trap for no reason other than to create some really stupid drama, Hotaru is an extremely frustrating character to have as the main character. She's one of the most annoying leads I've seen in a long time. She has that aforementioned sense of justice, but it's only brought up every once in a while when convenient. She grows to love survival games very quickly, and that almost becomes a point of contention and room for deeper characterization, but they do almost nothing with it. For whatever reason, she has some sort of intense bloodlust when she gets really into a game, but it ends up being nothing other than her eyes are drawn differently and she sort of moves faster. She's actually really bad with a gun, as you find out very quickly. Other than that, I want to slap her every time she opens her mouth. Just imagine an obnoxiously gung ho shounen protagonist with the emotional maturity of a 12 year old girl that gets really excited over everything.\\n\\n\r\nMatsuoka is the closest thing to an intersting character as part of the story revolves around him getting over his issues, but it's extremely hard to care about him when he has so little screen time. It's almost like dedicating the plot to a side character. \\n\\n\r\nYukimura is extremely forgettable. He's a creepy shut-in, pervert that has no friends except Mattsun (and now Hotaru). He was bullied a lot back in the day, and Matsuoka was the one who stood up for him. So now he just has a creepy attachment to him. You could say he's the pervert who's incredibly clingly to Matsuoka and that'd be about the entirety of his character.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other character is garbage. I already talked about Midori, so I should mention the side characters... there's like three and I'd be lying if I said they were even fleshed out enough to be one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the two components that matter most, story and characters, are absolute garbage. There's nothing to be said about the music since I can't even recall a single track from the soundtrack, shows how memorable it is, and the art style is kinda bland. The animation is kind of acceptable, but nothing to write home about. So I can't even give it a point or two for that.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I need to talk about the action scenes. This could have been the anime's saving grace, but it was a total let down. All of the choreography of the surival games is out of whack. It's pretty clear that there was little to no spatial awareness in the planning of the action scenes. The best example I could cite: Hotaru is facing down an enemy. The shot implies that there's about 20-30 feet between them. Then when she runs at him, it looks like she's running the distance of a football field. Given that they were in a forest at the time, it's even worse since you could use trees as markers. There were only a few trees near them, yet Hotaru runs by a bunch of them. This sounds nitpicky, but it's really infuriating and totally immersion breaking when given that there's tons of room for realism in the game they're playing. Even stuff like that aside, none of these survival game scenes are particularly fancy. In fact, it often feels like they go out of their way not to show them to you. The first couple of episodes involved Hotaru getting totally hyped to get out and shoot people up, but instead of the viewer getting to see her try, it cuts to her instantly failing and leaving the battlefield. Even when we do see her in action, it's either totally lame or something stupid and immersion breaking like what I described earlier. And at this point I haven't even mentioned how everyone plays this game like they don't even want to win. They're not using real guns, it's not a life or death situation, yet everyone seems to rather talk menacingly to each other instead of just shooting each other. The number of times where someone totally would have gotten shot if the person holding the gun to them just shut up and pulled the trigger is way higher than it should be. How is anyone expected to feel any tension in this already incredibly low stakes (in the grandest scheme of things) game when people are practically refusing to do the only thing you do in it? It's like watching a really bad stereotypical shounen where a fight that could have taken ten minutes last three episodes because no one would shut up and do what they're supposed to be doing. So, the entire show falls apart even on a conceptual level. You're given a realistic game, why not let everyone play it realistically instead of like a really bad fighting shounen? \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is bottom of the barrel. It's certainly not the worst I've seen, but it's pretty close, and I wouldn't feel bad about lumping it together with the only other title I've given a 1 to. The characters are mindnumbingly bad, the story surrounding them gives you no real reason to care about it, and everything else is flat out unimpressive. Also, did I mention that it even manages to have an infuriating flashback filter? It even messes up in that department.\\n\\n\r\n1/10 - I'd have more fun pounding my head against a wall",

            "content": "Meet Hotaru Tachibana, a girl with a strong sense of justice. She is easily mistaken for a boy, because of her broad shoulders, short hair, and confrontational attitude. She has an altercation with a host named Masamune Matsuoka, who mistakes her for a boy. In order to pay for the damage she caused, she joins his survival game group, Toy Gun Gun. The only problem? Girls aren't allowed!\r\nI believe the best way to describe Aoharu's issues in a word is: disorganized. There's comedy, but this isn't a comedy anime. There's some drama, but this isn't drama or tragedy anime. There's a cross-dressing female, but thisisn't a gender bender. And there's some action, but this is by no means an action anime. Like anime such as Kekkai Sensen, Aoharu x Kikanjuu spreads itself too thin over too many genres, and that is what leads to its downfall.\\n\r\nWhile Aoharu has survival games in it, it doesn't have enough action scenes, nor is the animation good enough to distinguish Aoharu as a good action anime. The art isn't amazing enough to be spellbound by it. \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS in this paragraph*\\n\r\nLikewise, the anime's plot is weak. What is the goal of the anime? Is it for Hotaru to improve her skills? Considering she doesn't improve much, no. Is it for her to admit she's a girl? Considering that doesn't happen, no. Is it for Toy Gun Gun to win TGC or beat Hoshishiro? Neither of those happens, so no. Is it for Masamune to overcome his vendetta against Midori? While this does happen, it only surfaces as a huge repetitive issue in episode 11 and is solved in episode 12. So no.\\n\r\n*END SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nWithout strong action or plot, characters need to fill that void. Let's look at the characters--are they complex? Hotaru as a black and white view of the world; she sees everything in terms of justice. Masamune has an abandonment complex, but it literally only surfaces in the last two episodes. Yukimura, despite being the most entertaining character of the show, is flat. All we know about him is he is extremely attached to Masamune and is a perv. Midori is a sadist, which is fine, but we don't ever see why he wants to torment Masamune so. Fujimon is cute, but that's about it. And so on, and so forth. The characters, while entertaining enough at a superficial level, aren't three-dimensional. They're shallow, so they're hard to relate to. And I'm saying this despite my attraction to Masamune and Midori.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake; this anime is not bad. I dragged my feet almost every week, but I was mildly entertained by every episode. Having two eye candy characters helped. But the flat characters, lack of depth, and disorganized storyline really detracted from my experience. (And yes, the fujobait bothered me, but not as much as those other issues.) I don't feel like this anime has changed me or taught me anything. Not to mention, the only thing I looked forward to all season--Hotaru confessing she's a girl--never happened. It's not a bad anime, but it's not very good either, by my standards. It's just average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 5/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? Not really. But it's entertaining, if you have some time to kill.",

            "content": "I've seen a pretty mixed bag with reviews of this show, and I thought I'd give it my two cents as well.\r\nStory 8/10- It initially drew me in because of the whole Ouran-esque premise of the cross dressing, the host club, etc. However, that really only is in the first few episodes. After that, the story revolves around the three main characters forming and team and playing survival games. I don't really have an issue with this, other than the fact that the ending was pretty bad, and didn't match the quality of the rest of the show. It left me with a lot ofunanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- The reason I picked up this show was because I saw it on MAL and thought Tachibana looked cool. The art really appealed to me, and scenes in forests and stuff are really beautiful. Character designs were also well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 - I finished watching this a while ago, so I can't really remember the sound. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that memorable. There was some spunky music thrown in at the action scenes, and it got the job done. The voice acting was pretty good, I especially liked Yukimura's monotone and slightly creepy voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10- The actual characters were good. Tachibana tends to talk about herself in the third person, but it wasn't annoying, and some people even think it's cute. Yukimura was my personal favourite. Masamune was the typical cool guy, and the other characters like Midori and his team were fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that we get a bit of a backstory from Yukimura and also (kind of ) Masamune and Midori. Tachibana doesn't really get a backstory, and they never explain why she is so obsessed with justice. While watching the series, it didn't bother me, but after finishing it and thinking it about it, it kind of did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It was super hilarious, and made me binge watch the short 12 episodes one ofter the other. Give this a chance even if you don't really like the premise of survival games. At first, I didn't really think I would like it, but I loved it! And this is coming from someone who doesn't even like sports anime that much. This was probably my personal favourite from Summer 2015.",

            "content": "When I watched this show I was actually expecting to be the generic action series but with  a gender bend character or lets say a trap as the main character. A trap is nowadays common in the anime industry, but does that mean they're bad? Not exactly. But then again Im talking about the show not the trap itself. We're talking about the show. Anyway Aoharu x Kikanjuu might be one of those series that people would either drop because of its generic synopsis or watch because of the story and progression.\r\nLet's begin. Before I start I might spoil somethings out in the anime,so if you're not watching the series I would suggest to look at another review. Leaving you guys with that warning for the series, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To Start off, the story is quite simple to even understand and makes you set in the mind that this is going to be a survival game series, where people shoot with guns. But. They don't die. At first yes it was to actually pay the stuff, but then it turns into something else. The series consists into progression and building up the tension, which for me was a very good idea considering before going towards the big guns you need to add some build up and training. This is what the show was doing at the first half. Then later on the big guns came, but to be honest for me at some points in the fights it felt a bit underwhelming but at the same time at some areas it feels and looks very hyped. Don't get me wrong I love hyped stuff, but at some points it feels a bit moreso disappointing. For me my big issue with the anime is that they went to this cliche kind of ending. What cliche ending? Friendship. You see, this type of ending is not terrible, its just that its moreso disappointing for me as a follower of the series this season, and I was expecting something more from it. Unfortunately that happens a some points for me. Is the story bad? Not exactly. Its not terrible but its not as a OMG series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well the series has some sort of good characters. To be precise the characters for me were okay characterized and a bit developed, for the main cast at the very least. They have very nice personalities that makes me love them a lot. Especially Yukimura (the guy's VA is Yoshitsugu Matsuoka aka Kirito and Sora) which he's like a pervert type of character and mangaka artist. \\n\\n\r\nMattsun also is a good character, at least to an extension. I was curious about his backstory no doubt, and also about his personality and development made me love him more. However at some points I have to get a bit of a see saw. In other words his right and wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFinally Hotarou, the main protagonist. She's one of those couple of characters that do not go to damsel in distress treatment at least. Usually in anime, female characters are treated as a weak character trope. Thats not a bad thing to my eyes depending on how they're used. In here Hotarou can defend herself at points where I want to cheer for her, she also has this bloodlust which makes her sadistic, which is why it makes me love her more. She's well skilled and such ends. But my issue with her was, remember when I said about the ending being disappointing a bit? well... she didn't told them that she was a girl at the end. Which makes me feel desperated. But does that mean she's a bad character? No. She's a good female protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters took a role for a couple of episodes or at least most of the entire series, a few were left thrown aside to my perspective which was a damn shame to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: This show is made by Brain Base, the studio that made shows such as Mawaru Penguindrum and my favorite OVA series Mazinkaiser. Of course, this series has a lot of bright colors and nice way to blend with scenarios. Its not like the best art I've seen like Mawaru where you see a lot of artistic ways, but it looks enough to get at least a 7. Animation as well is the big part of this. It feels at times fluid and mobility, it also gives the viewer a sense of hype as well. At bit of points yes, there were some choppy scenes, but not to the point of a ground breaking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound:  Now this is the strongest point of the anime series. This series consists into three phrases: Very good sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack. When it comes to these scenarios I will say they nailed everything right on this one, especially with the sound effects. It just gives you chills at your spine and a lot of tension can be heard around here and there. The Voice acting fits perfectly to their character traits and they match so much that it makes me applaud them more. The soundtrack would be either ominous and at some points rock style. Some have different ways of course, but to me they sound and match well with the scenarios. For the Opening and Ending they're catchy as a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with bits of its faults I personally think that you can actually enjoy this show, heck if I enjoyed it, why can't you? it has a lot to offer but a few that leaves like a sad faces.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is one of the few series that I personally would recommend, even if you are not a fan of these, give it a shot at least. Who knows you might like it.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu proves yet again how easy it is to take an interesting idea and stuff it full of unnecessary complications.\r\nStory and Characters:\r\nThe story starts as Tachibana (actually a girl) mistakenly accuses a guy of seducing his, I mean her, friend. As compensation he has her join his airsoft team. Other than the strange fact that Tachibana never cares to correct people as to her gender, everything starts out okay. But this later becomes an unnecessarily large conflict when it's state the team MC join doesn't take girls. \r\nUnfortunately the show becomes less about airsoft and more about the ridiculous drama and conflict betweenMC's team, Toy Gun Gun, and another team Hoshishiro. The airsoft battles are okay, but you'd expect more in the way of strategy. The show draws little actual interest towards airsoft, which is surprising given that it's the main reason most people would pick up the show\\n\\n\r\nEveryone takes their games seriously. Way too seriously actually. It's stated in episode 1. No training or skill is shown and it actually makes the viewers take it less seriously. As You'll find that the characters are simply a fujo's wet dream, with a neet homo manga writer, a guy who works at a host club, a sadist, and finally a boy who's not really a boy who ties it all together. \\n\\n\r\nThe strangest thing is Tachibana's sense of \"justice\". It's never really explained where this comes from though he mentions it frequently, and it's outright thrown out the window and turns into simply being her self-admitted selfishness later on. So it's just his own little meaningless character trait. The characters aren't good, and neither is the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBrain's Base put a lot into this and you can tell. Unfortunately for them it doesn't look like they'll get much out of it as preorder sales are abysmal. It would be more appropriate if they threw their money at making season 2s for their actual successes, even if they may not sell as well a the first, rather than throwing all their money into such a poor story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed this series for around the first 6 episodes. It was a bit silly but it was fun to watch. But towards the latter half too much dumbly written drama and poorly attempted characterization came into play and it was hardly about the airsoft. I just wanted it to end.\\n\\n\r\nIt wish I would've been able to end the season saying this is a show I didn't regret watching because it seemed that way when I started. It proved that you can't pander to multiple crowds at different ends of the spectrum and get positive recognition. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully I never again have to write a review in which I spend more time correcting \"his/he\" to \"her/she\" again.  If you want a show about actual airsoft, this isn't it.",

            "content": "I'm Japanese so I noticed but, uhhhh, I hate to break this to you all but the title of the anime is subbed wrong. It's actually called Seishunn X Kikanjuu, Say-Shun. Seishunn (\u9752\u6625\uff09means adolescence. The direct/Khun Yomi pronunciation of seishunn (\u9752\u6625) is Ao Haru because ao--> \u9752 means blue and \u6625\u30fc\uff1e means spring as in the season. BTW aoHaru don't make sense in Japanese and it's not a word. So the translators did a bad job subbing the title. Makes sense right? because Tachibana(the MC) is still like around 16~17 meaning She's still in her adolescent age. And throughout the story she is introduced withthe survival games which involves machine guns and all that stuff, which directly connects to a part of the title of this anime which is \"Kikanjuu\" (machine gun).  The plot was decent 8/10, characters were fine7/10, the cliffhanger in the end was disappointing but you're gonna get over it if you read the rest of it in the manga. Where at one point she reveals her secret. (trust me, it's the most satisfying thing ever) I typically fine anime that involves guns fun to watch so this one's in my good list. But I can't say that it's in one of my favorites list. At one point in the anime the MC showed some personality that doesn't belong to her. Like as if she has 2 personalities. But I guess thats what makes the anime a bit spicy.",

            "content": "There comes a time in every anime viewers life when they come across something seemingly unique and are compelled to watch it. Either through stunning visuals, or an interesting synopsis, we dive into an anime world knowing full well it might just end up being 'meh.' Right, so here I arrive with this anime, Aoharu x Kikanjuu.\r\nStory: It was a 'good' story. The whole premise of them becoming the best in Japan at survival games was interesting, and kept me in it for the long run. What I didn't like is how they kept speeding things up further than they'd need to, they squished alot into one 12 episode anime leaving me somewhat unsatisfied. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Possibly the strongest point this anime had. The action scenes were what kept me watching this, and the creepy close up shots on many of the characters faces made the show have stunning visuals (like I said above). The designs of characters and more specifically the secondary characters uniforms were really cool. I mean, it wasn't gurren lagann level of fantastic art, but it was really SHINY.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound felt out of place to be honest, there was too much elevator music. It's literally what you would of listened to waiting to get to the floor of your hotel room. It seemed too jazzy for the show, as no one really had a jazzy personality. Not even Mattsun had that spunky of a personality. The music didn't match the story. Regarding the intro song, it was fun to listen to. So the whole soundtrack wasn't a whole miss. And it wasn't making my ears fall off or anything. The voices were just okay. I thought midori's voice did a good job highlighting him being very sadistic and Yukki's voice matching him as being pretty dull/interested in perverted things.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nI kind of wish this was a shounen-ai so instead of deliberately hiding that the main character is a girl most of the show, they'd of just had her as a him. The main 'girl' is pretty unfeminine and looks more like a uke to me. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like that the main character is a justice freak, well, you'll have a ball, but she falls a little flat in development. Not just physical (budum bum).\\n\r\nI liked the dynamics between the secondary character team and the first, but the characters really weren't developed  any further than just being a tool to the action of the story and humor. It was ALL about the survival games and the friendship that made no sense to of been made (besides sharing an interest) and the loss of friendship. If you're okay with characters having no individuality past being 'sadistic' 'masochistic' 'bloodthirsty,' or 'mundane' then I guess you can watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't a BAD show by any means. It had great action, the art was spectacular, and it COULD be interesting at times. So it's a good action story that doesn't take up much time, and it's about a game that some of us play, and the passion that comes with it. I guess don't knock it till you try it?\\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW:\r\nIf you are looking for a short, funny and enjoyable anime, with simple art and nice backgrounds, you should consider watching this anime. \r\nStory (6 out of 10): The beginning may seem like Ouran Host Club, but that's really just the first episode. The story revolves about a high school girl Tachibana Hotaru, who got drawn into the world of survival games by her two neighbours to repay a debt - the twist is that her two team-mates don't know that she's a girl (girls are forbidden in their team). \r\nIf you want an anime with a deep and spectacular story, this mightnot be the anime. Don't get me wrong, I loved the story and it's quite simple and enjoyable. It was funny and the ending was great (somehow, the endings in anime always disappoint me, but this wasn't really the case). Although I would have liked to see a few more action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) and sound (9): The art was great and simple (just as I like it). The characters were nicely drawn and I loved the backgrounds. The sound effects weren't overused, as they are in many anime and the music was also great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7 out od 10): Each character was different and had it's own personality. They were enjoyable and funny and I can't decide on my favourite one. As the series progresses, you find out more about them. But they didn't really develop, this is where the anime lacks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10 out of 10): Why did I give it such a score? It's funny, it's simple and perfect for a short casual watching. It certainly didn't dissapoint.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As I said, it's one of my favourites anime. It's simple, short and interesting, with likable characters and great music. You find yourself laughing every episode. I really hope for a second season. While the anime isn't deep, or spectacular, it's really really  enjoyable, so I'm giving it a 9.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is a fantastic anime. It is an awesome gender bender, an awesome sports anime, and an awesome friendship story. I feel like a lot of people ended up not liking this anime because they based their opinions off of the first two episodes and then were shocked with the turn it made once it really started in the 3rd ep. I want to clarify-- this is not Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns. There IS a host club in the beginning, there IS a girl who wears pants instead of a skirt, she DOES break something and initially is forcedto play on a team to repay her debts, and yes they mistake her as a dude. But this doesn't matter. After the 3rd ep, none of that matters because the beginning was just a quick means to introduce the main character to survival games (aka paintball with beebee guns). I'm not happy with how they did this or how they rushed it, but couldn't be bothered to care too much about it after I got to the amazing main plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy dramatic sports animes with a slightly darker overtone, hilarious moments, and an emphasis on friendship, then this is for you. I was surprisingly entertained and excited about an anime about survival games. If you like paintball like I do, you'll probably be pretty thrilled since you never thought there'd be a paintball anime. But like any sports anime, it's dramatic. Sometimes it's hilariously dramatic, sometimes it's seriously, heart-string pulling dramatic, either way it's dramatic in a good way. What I really enjoyed about this story is that it progresses basically like it would if it were a male protagonist. She trains to get better, she sucks at first, but has great potential, and is determined to get better for herself and for her team. I really enjoyed this aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice, it's new style, it's smooth. Nothing really stood out to me regarding the animation, besides an occasional really sweet angle. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is fantastic. The song gets you pumped up, the animation really suits the song and gives it a darker feel, and it's sung by the voice actors of the three main characters which is always a good +1. I thought the soundtrack of the whole anime was pretty good. They're really good at pumping you up during battle scenes and at important moments, but I felt that their weakest link here was during the softer moments in the anime. They're really good at battle sequences, but during downtimes and more heart-felt moments, the music was either a little bland or just plain forgettable. I felt like they could have done better during these moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the characters. Without trying to spoil anything:\\n\\n\r\nMatsuoka is a host in all the best ways. He's attentive, a good listener, and also caring to a fault. As a captain of the survival team Toy Gun Gun, he successfully utilizes these skills to bring out the potential of his teammates. As a character, he's very well-done. The more you watch, the more layers you see of him, the more you find out why he acts the way he does, and the more you find out just how much they thought about his underlying personality. He's a great example of a well-developed and well-written character that can be both strong and sensitive. \\n\\n\r\nYukimura is hilarious. Yukimura is a hentai mangaka with racy tastes, and isn't afraid to show it. He's the type who would creepily sit in a corner reading porn magazines. He's also a first class survival gamer. Pretty early on you find out that he has a dark past that's led him to only trusting and relying on Matsuoka (Matsuoka also has a dark past that's been touched on in the anime but hasn't fully been disclosed yet). He brings this obsession with Matsuoka into the survival games, playing as a sniper who always has his back. Yukimura undergoes some amazing character development throughout the show. I won't go into details, but I'll just say it was nice seeing him become more trusting and also more independent as the show went on.\\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to take a moment to say that the side and supporting characters were also interesting and nicely developed. For example, the \"evil\" team Toy Gun Gun is fighting against has striking characters who will quickly become either your favorites or your most hated. And then they'll be developed a bit more, and your view will quickly change from black and white to grey. I can't wait to see how these side and supporting characters will continue to develop in season 2 (really hoping for a second season).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the main character. I could write a whole research paper on why Tachibana, Hotaru is such a good and necessary character. It's so refreshing to see a sports anime with a female lead who's actually treated like a proper main character. Tachibana is like a classic shounen lead: she's all about justice, likes to battle people who go against her sense of justice, and is athletically talented. She's also extremely naive at first and a little oblivious. But through a misunderstanding and a journey of self-discovery and friendship, she learns what and who she's fighting for. In the end, she matures into an even more amazing, and hilarious, lead who I hope to see develop even more in the future. For a shounen, this is a standard character setup. But for a female protagonist, this is anything but. Like \"Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit\", she is a physically strong protagonist who isn't afraid to show both her femininity and masculinity, holds her own against her male teammates, and is proud of being herself in all that that entails. She doesn't consider females weak, and she doesn't consider males strong. She believes in herself and her strength as Tachibana, Hotaru, just as she believes in Matsuoka and Yukimura's strength as her teammates. She is a valuable member of Toy Gun Gun and is, eventually, treated like a valuable member. Knowing both her strengths and her weaknesses, Matsuoka recognizes just how amazing Tachibana is, and just how amazing she could become. It is so exciting to see a female lead like Tachibana in a medium so devoid of well-written female protagonists (without a story solely focused on a love interest). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this anime. It was hilarious, it was thrilling, it was heart-warming, it was refreshing-- I can't say enough good things about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved this anime to death, there were some shortcomings regarding the first 2 episodes. Despite that, the anime was still a fantastic watch. \\n\r\nI would not recommend this to people expecting Ouran High School Host Club, people who're just in it for action and guns, people who want Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns, or people who're expecting a weak, moe female lead holding a large gun. \\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to people who enjoy sports animes, well-done gender bends, comedies, and heart-felt friendships.",

            "content": "Overall rating: 8.2/10 \r\nA lot of people might compare this series to Ouran High School Host Club, for the reason that one of the main characters is a host. However, the focus of AoHaru x Kikanjuu is on survival games--not on a host club. Instead, it focus on three characters and how survival games contributes to their progress throughout the series (and beyond): Hotaru Tachibana, Masamune Matsuoka and Tooru Yukimura--the members of a survival game team, Toy Gun Gun. (Yes, I know what you might be thinking: their naming sense can definitely improve...) \r\n***Just a warning: What I mention in my review can be consideredas potential spoilers (as I talked about what happened in certain episodes, mostly the beginning, for this section), so please keep that in mind. Of course, I'll try to limit the spoilers, when I can. Also, just to note, my review is more or so formatted as such: some explained events mixed with the points that stood out to me.***\\n\\n\r\nThe story of AoHaru x Kikanjuu starts off with Hotaru, a girl who looks and dresses like a boy, meeting her neighbor, Masamune Matsuoka, while he's talking on the phone outside of her apartment. Hotaru couldn't think of another way to make him move, so she slammed her fist on the door, causing Matsuoka-san to stop what he's doing. Just before Hotaru went into her apartment, there was a gun lying on the ground, and to her surprise, it's Matsuoka-san's. The next day, after talking to her friend, who was greeted by Matsuoka-san earlier, she found out that he worked at a host club and that the gun that she saw is actually a toy gun. Matsuoka-san then challenged Hotaru to a survival game, and having confidence in hers skills, she accepted. While her physical abilities is something to watch out for, she ended up losing to Matsuoka-san's experience and skill in survival game fighting. The condition that Matsuoka-san have for her loss was: to join his survival game team for paying off her debt of the damage she caused in the host club (while playing the game). Matsuoka-san is indeed a sly one... \\n\\n\r\nDespite not wanting to play survival games at first, Hotaru grew to really like them--to the point where she was at a loss for having to even consider not playing them at all. It was Yukimura, the other member of Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined (who writes a specific genre of manga) made her realize this, by pointing out to her: \"...now you've tasted the air of the battlefield. You can't go back to an ordinary life.\" What drew Hotaru towards survival games was the sense of fighting that the players engage in. Hotaru have a strong sense of justice, and with that justice, it can turn to having an unyielding (and sometimes, even bloodthirsty) desire to take down whoever she's going up against, and it shows in how she plays during survival games. Although Hotaru does not have the best survival game sense, she does withhold a strong fighting spirit; on top of that, she's armed with her (almost superhuman-like) strength. During a battle, her opponents could even sense her aura of bloodthirst in the atmosphere surrounding her, and that's why she's someone to watch out for during a survival game. \\n\\n\r\nHotaru is a character that I found easy to like, and wanting to cheer for. She's strong and can fight for herself, but at the same time, since she doesn't have as much life experiences as the other two main characters (who have their dark pasts that can weigh them down), she's not one that is quick to understand why certain characters act the way they do, and why certain events turn out the way it does. Although, that's understandable, because for most instances, if you don't know much about something, it's difficult for you to comprehend just what is going on. It's refreshing, yet awesome to see a female, especially lead character, who can hold her own and is willing to fight on her own--even though she might not do it very well at particular times. \\n\\n\r\nThrough each experience Hotaru came across, primarily as being involved with survival games and the members of Toy Gun Gun, she came to better understand not only herself, but also those around her. The development between characters occurred mostly through the conversations they have with each other, and what they learn and come to think because of them. First of all: Yukimura. Yukimura, upon first meeting him, seems to be an introverted, distant and unwelcoming person; however, that's due to the fact that he knows firsthand just how it's like to be betrayed by those he thought were his friends. After getting to know Hotaru, he found it not as difficult to be less closed up, and more willing to adjust how he approaches matters. As the series went on, with the more development Yukimura had, the more likable I found him to be. Yukimura can be serious, when trying to help with the situation at hand--or to just simply trying help out, but at the same time, he can also be undeniably adorable, in what he says, in the way that he talks, and in what he does. Onto Kanae: whenever she sees Hotaru not as herself, she would ask if she's okay, and that if anything's bothering her. In an instance where Hotaru seemed so obviously unmotivated, Kanae did something to help her pick herself up. She even recalled something that Hotaru told her a while ago, when her team was about to give up before they even play a match during physical education class: \"I never thought about winning making me cool, or losing making me uncool. ... If anything... Giving up before you even try is kind of uncool. That's why I want to be someone who'll fight as many times as it takes, and never give up. That's got to be way cooler.\" Remembering such specific words just shows how much she values Hotaru as a friend, how much she cares for her friends' wellbeing and overall, how great of a friend she truly is. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art of the show certain adds to the intensity of particular scenes, and it's what makes the show so exciting to watch. During the fight scenes, to compliment the expressions, a darker shade of color palate would be used to present the characters' faces and certain music would be played to enhance the tension in the air. As a result, all the fight scenes captured my attention, as somehow, I always found myself wanting to see how the characters engage each other in all different sorts of battle scenarios, whether it's: close-range, far-range, near the flag area, one on one, snipping from afar, and so on.  It's also very fascinating to watch how others react and act to the vibe that Hotaru gives off, as well as her quick movements that catches them off-guard.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an outstanding job in voice acting their characters. I especially like the voice of Hotaru; the voice that Mikako Komatsu (aka Neko from K Project, Ginger from Gangsta, etc) used for Hotaru is boyish, so it helps in convincing the other characters that she's a boy. It doesn't sound forced, in fact, it comes off as quite natural and clear. The voice that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (who also voiced many other characters, such as Kirito from SAO, Souma from SnS, Kanemaru from DnA, etc), Yukimura's voice actor, used for Yukimura was really fitting for his character. His low and quiet way of speaking represents Yukimura as a character well. The voice actors also did a great job in singing the Opening and Ending songs; I personally like the Ending songs more (both Tic Tac and Gunjou Survival), as I find Mikako Komatsu's voice to be very fitting with the songs that she was given to sing. \\n\\n\r\n***(This section leads to more major spoilers, so read on only if you've finished watching the series!)***\\n\r\nMatsuoka-san said something to Hotaru before they began the first game they played with each other, and that is: \"Let's start this deathless death march.\" Now looking back and thinking about all of the games that they played, this line definitely held significance all throughout the series. When watching the episodes, where the characters takes the games so seriously, you might be thinking: ...but it's just a game. While that's true, it does shine light on many aspects in life. Yes, getting shot by a toy gun does not secure your death outside of the survival games, although it's possible for you to get injured from participating in them. Here's the thing: All the events that took place were, in one way or another, in relation to the survival games. The games reflected the possible outcomes of what can happen in real life-and-death situations, where people's lives can actually be at stake. An example of this could be: the opponent's got you cornered and the only options are: to 1. be shot, or 2. surrender. The line emphasize just how survival games with toy guns can shine light on real survival fights, with real guns, or even: invisible--not detectable by the eyes--kind of guns. For each person, the gun(s) that can \"shoot\" through them differs. With that said, most of the \"guns\" that leaves wounds and unforgettable scars are ones that are able to \"shoot\" into people's minds, and eventually, into their hearts. And with this series, it's clear that it's the invisible, not easily detected ones--at least not at first glance--that leaves impactful impressions on characters. You could infer so with the unraveling of how each character think and act because of the past experiences (and for some, traumas) that they've endured--especially for Matsuoka-san. \\n\\n\r\n\"There are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. I've always been the latter.\" The \"shot\" that have been fired deep within Matsuoka-san was this: all the people that let go of him so far in his life. He never reached out towards any of them, even though he could've; instead, he just watch them leave, because he thinks that if he tries to reach out, he might really push them away for good. So, before Hotaru could take her leave, Matsuoka-san pushed her away by kicking her off the team, after Toy Gun Gun lost to Midori and his team. He didn't want her to hate survival games, and eventually, hate him for making her hate the games in the first place. For once, Yukimura didn't agree with what Matsun decided, and chose to not follow him on this decision. So, to help clear up the misunderstandings, he told Hotaru about the members that left Toy Gun Gun because of Matsuoka and his baggage with survival games--which led them to turn their backs on him. \\n\\n\r\nAs a response to Matsuoka's decision, Hotaru challenged him to a survival game, and that if she wins, he'll have to say something that she wants him to say. Hotaru kept losing, but her determination propelled her to keep trying. It eventually led him to ask the real question to himself: \"Why won't you abandon me?\"--as all those that left him did. Seeing Hotaru's persistency and earnestness on trying to win, made Matsuoka-san see just how much she is trying to reach out to him--the way that he didn't, the way that he was afraid to, the way that he wanted to--for others. It also opened his eyes: that she wants him to take and accept her hand and that Hotaru isn't someone that he can shake off that easily. There are people who just can't bring themselves to let go, even if they were told to do so and even if they think they should--especially if they see the other person in pain, suffering, unable to move forward; Hotaru is absolutely one of them. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps Hotaru's determination and earnestness made Matsun start to see more of how others feel around him too, not just how he feels about them (as he can really get too wrapped inside his own head). To express his thoughts on Yukimura opposing him, he smiled, while telling him: \"Thanks for getting mad at me.\" \\n\\n\r\nBoth Yukimura and Hotaru managed to knock some sense into Matsuoka-san in the end; that's what they set out to do--and from the looks of it, they are getting better at doing so too. (Keep it up, because there's no others that can keep him in check...) \\n\r\n***(Spoilers section over.)***\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu very much; it's one of the shows that got me the most hyped for the next episodes--and during the summers season as a whole. ^.^ \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to fans of: Bishounens, Friendships, Action, Comedy, Shounen, and a show that have a strong female lead--along with great supporting characters\\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n***",

            "content": "A surprisingly enjoyable series that is less plot driven and more character driven. The story wasn't terrible but it also wouldn't have been as engaging had it not been for its wonderfully interesting cast of characters. While I found Hotaru extremely off-putting initially, especially her use of illeism, eventually I grew to tolerate her and even found her somewhat endearing by the finale. Others I loved right off the bat: Yukki and Fujimon are hands down my favorites. One I can relate to so well, the other is basically a giant puppy. \r\nYou pick up early on that AxK thrives on being extreme. At times,it's almost ridiculous how much weight they give the survival games and it teeters at the edge of being overly dramatic. The characters as well, while lovable, are also very predictable in terms of personality-types. What I wasn't expecting was how greatly exaggerated the character personalities were going to be. \\n\\n\r\nI consider the art a fitting style for AxK. The animation, coloring, lighting, everything looks gorgeous and is definitely one of the best I've seen recently. I'm especially a fan of the scenes when Hotaru lets out bloodlust - again, an example of how this series takes everything over the top, but I say this with an amused fondness. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a heartwarming, very emotional season finale that made me go \"d'awwww\" for several minutes. I'm definitely keeping my fingers crossed for as season 2 as there were still several plot points that were briefly touched upon but never fully explored.",

            "content": "Eleventh Review....Aoharu x Kikanjuu! \r\nThis series was introduced to me by a good friend of mine, she knew the type of anime that I am into so she suggested I watch this one. About a Girl pretending to be a Boy in order to be on a Shooting Team - Toy Gun Gun. \r\nAt first I was a bit iffy in the idea that the girl pretends to be a boy, however I watched the first episode together with my friend and I absolutely loved it. I loved the fact that Hotaru (The Main Character) still has her friend and it shows us a bitof her everyday life before getting straight into the main event. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was well designed, about a tournament between Gun Shooting (Pretty much BB Pellets) and this team that Hotaru finds herself in. I really got into the story and enjoyed the series a lot, once I had watched a few more episodes I was really finding myself amused. The more the story picks up the more you are wanting to understand what had happened with Team Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined. It has it's serious elements but the series also has it's funny elements to keep you awake and not bored. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was a favourite of mine, it was well developed and well put together, especially within the fights. The way that they produced the battlegrounds was also a nice sight and it shown a lot of detail that had went in to the story board of the scenes. Sound was also a good element, they had a nice range of instrumental music throughout and the opening was very well played. The sound made more of the battles come to life and gets you really into it and picks your interests up as the fight carries on, puttign you on edge. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was very well introduced into this show, for Hotaru being the main character she was introduced straight away as one of these Tom Boys that like to protect the 'Princesses' and this made the main character even more enjoyable to watch. The next two main characters were Masamune and Tooru, these characters to me looked like a very nice pair that worked well together, they were a combined team of specialist tactics and this made them perform together a well developed character point. There is much unknown about these characters but as the story goes on the truth is unraveled and it slowly reveals their past and how it all ties together with the tournament. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I have and I am proud to say that now having completed this it is one of my favourites. It was very enjoyable to watch and it was also at some points emotional. It keeps you hooked into the series in order to find out what happens and what the end outcome is. I actually was quite happy with how the anime turned out and how well it was put together, I loved the idea and concept of a Gun Battle and the character developments made this even more interesting to carry on watching. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. This could totally be turned into a Yuri/Yaoi haha! \\n\\n\r\n~ Canaan\\n\\n\r\n*Spoiler* \\n\r\nWas upset that at the end of the series she still never mentioned that she is a she and not actually a he, so hoping for a second season at least for a follow up.",

            "content": "Boy, Aoharu x Kikanjuu was one weird anime. It's seriously either a hit or miss with it; if you expect something similar to Ouran, walk away, you won't get it. Even if it could be, somehow, categorized as a reverse harem (depends how you look at it; at the core it's stil about one girl surrounded by bishies that get some kind of liking to her, romantic or just simply interest), the point and story of the show is something else entirely.\r\nStory  - 5\r\nIt's plain mediocre. Nothing really happens and nothing really gets concluded, besides Mattsun's self-victimizing perception of himself and others, maybe andTachibana and Yukimura's developed friendship. The sketchy thing going around is the survival game part of it. Half of the show feels like some sort of Kuroko no basket; inventing skills that sound like magical powers and look extraordinarily awesome, but when you come down to it, there's nothing magical about it, it's just \"talent\" and \"force of will\". That looks awesome, yes, and the atmosphere at some points was unbearable and very tension-directed, but keeping it in context, however, that's a different issue entirely. The epic tense atmospheres were a lie; they were tense, but the reasons for the tension are mostly laughable because of how seriously they are taken and too trivial to take seriously overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe genderbend part is also an issue; while I do appreciate that the main girl doesn't just happen to genderbent for some specific trouble she had, but she's just simply \"boyish\" and that's really fresh, I hoped for that to cause a bit more of an issue and not be a \"detail\" that she was going to forget to mention for the whole show only to make a semi-issue out of it later, which in the end it won't matter in the slightest anyway. I do give it points for dragging it so far that some characters might question their sexuality though...XD\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\\n\r\nThere's this type of over the top emotional exageration prevailing through the main cast and, differenty from other people, I don't feel like completely bashing on it. I found it more than once to be laughable and exagerated, but there are stuff that to some people matter more than to the rest and I feel like that was made obvious when the contrast between Toy Gun Gun and other players was made. This made me believe that it was only Toy Gun Gun and Hoshishiro that took this game so seriously and personal, both of them because of personal reasons and needs that they couldn't get in their everyday lives. However, that was portrayed pretty badly. Mattsun's connection and relationship with Midori was only scratched down upon, as well as their relationships with the rest of the world too. There's not much development going on; it's more like \"take it and believe it\" type of situation. While I liked Mattsun's internal struggle in the last episode, I didn't feel like it completely justified the events before that. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of likeability, Yukimura was the one that made me go \"aww\" for the most part of the show. He's totally creepy sometimes, but he accepted that creepiness despite not being commonly socially accepted for it. Development-wise, he also overall lacks, but it was sweet how in the end he found something to believe in, even if it was different from what Mattsun believed, putting a stop to his blind loyalty; seriously the most that you can get in terms of development in this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7 \\n\\n\r\nI think that the animation had a very important role when it came to the over the top exageration of the characters' reactions, and to be able to send shivers on my spine with an overall trivial reason, there's some skill to be praised here. Unfortunately, animation got quite bad during the last few episodes which were made of very simplistic backgrounds and flashbacks to which the characters simply spoke \"upon\".\\n\\n\r\nSound -6\\n\r\nNothing deem of worth but I liked the opening song. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nDespite realizing the laughable exageration of it all, I couldnt help but fairly enjoy it. I don't know if it was some sort of guilty pleasure or if I looked for something beyond what I actually got, but it would be a lie if I said I didn't wait impatiently for each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 6 \\n\\n\r\nIt could have been way better. After episode 12 I expected there to be an episode 13 to wrap something up, instead I feel like I was left hanging with only half story done. I hope it gets a second season or if it doesn't at least some sort OVA finale.",

            "content": "ok so first off, I personally think a LOT of people do not give this Anime the credit it deserves. True there are some similarities between AoharuxKikanjuu and OHSHC so yeah. But really, with out all of the comparisons, I do believe this show has a pretty good plot line. I think people were hoping for a gory ripped limb from limb kind of anime. well they were sad Pandas once they realized that it was AirSoft wars... which were pretty well represented... Like seriously... have you ever been shot at point blank by a  high powered battery operated air soft gun with hardplastic pellets? No? than you have NO idea how serious these \"death battles\" can be. Trust me you do everything in your power to avoid being shot at point blank.... OUCH!!!! X0 and yes I have participated in Airsoft war games. they are just like that... :) So the story line, although incomplete, people need to see that you can only fit so much into 12 episodes... this is clearly a call back anime.. which means there NEEDS to be a season 2 to close up the quote on quote \"Plot holes\" which I believe are on purpose in order to grip the viewer into wanting to know more. The art was top notch. As expected of Funanmation, and the sound and voice acting was incredible. although a little over the top  with the Air Soft sound effects. the characters were very lovable except for the whole \"all boys are idiots\" theme that seems to be the rage nowadays. overall, I really did enjoy the anime. It was definately satisfying and I'm looking forward to a second season. So haters, go watch Cowboy Bebop... that seems to be a little more up your alley.. (a.k.a. TOTAL TRASH!!!)",

Although those who have watched Ouran High will primarily notice so many similarities between these two shows that it kinda creeps you out.\r\nBut don't worry, as the story progresses the similarities will fade out.\r\nSTORY-6 \r\nThe one thing I noticed about the story is the pacing. The pacing is inconsistent; some things that could be resolved quickly were dragged and things that are supposed to be given more screen time is cut short.\r\nFor example, Tachibana the MC was almost immediately free of his debt, afterwe witnessed them playing like once or twice. The same goes for the biggest event;TGC, after Toy Gun Gun's (the MC'S group) match with Hoshishiro, there wasn't even a glimpse of the other teams' fight! It ended just like that. Huh.\\n\r\nHowever, things like Tachibana's insecurity or excitement could be short and sweet, but they made it long and it felt draggy. They just looove flashbacks...As a result, the action scenes were cut short.\\n\r\nMany things were also left unanswered, like what really happened between Matsuoka and Midori?? There is also one more thing that bothers me. The MC's gender is repeated too many times that it feels redundant. Like yeah, yeah, we know you're a girl already!\\n\\n\r\nART-7 \\n\r\nThe art is quite pretty, but  it was not outstanding either. We'll get to see pretty sceneries sometimes, the character designs are also cute.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-7\\n\r\nThe OP helped to set the mood, the soundtracks were relatively okay, but it wasn't really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-7 \\n\r\nThe characters are  quite lovable, but they lack a solid background. That's why the characters felt kinda superficial. We don't know Tachibana's or Midori's background, and background building is very essential so that the characters don't seem superficial.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-8\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws, I enjoyed watching this series, paticularly the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL-7\\n\r\nI gave a 7 mainly because of the inconsistent pacing and the lack of character-building. However, once you overlook those things, you can sit back and enjoy.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI have never shot a gun. I have held my uncle\u2019s small pistol, though. He carries it around for self-defense purposes. He let me hold the weapon during a birthday party for one of my relatives, and I, rather stupidly, raised the gun up instead of aiming it downwards. Everyone was quick to yell at me and for good reason. Guns are dangerous. We watch action flicks, we play first-person shooters, and we read jokes about weapons, desensitizing us to their power. It is not until one is wielded that someone truly understands what it isthat he or she is holding.\\n\\n\r\nBefore real guns, there are the imitations, usually called BB guns. They shoot pellets, not bullets, but they are still dangerous and, for some, as fun as the real thing. Aoharu x Kikanjuu is filled to the brim with guns of this type and the survival games that incorporate their use. Although the guns are not actually the focus. They are the setting for the anime but not what the anime wants to talk about. Instead, the show concerns itself with heavier dilemmas. Deceit, rejection, and perseverance which, coincidentally enough, each occur in the very games the show shows.\\n\\n\r\nMy earlier recollection was sort of misleading. I have used a paintball gun before, during a friend\u2019s birthday. I was there with a bunch of other friends. I had on the goggles, the camo gear, and the big boots. Running around the obstacles and pretending as if I was in a real warzone was fun. Then I got hit with a paintball. And it hurt. A lot. I remember the stinging, despite the layers of clothes I had on, and the welt afterwards. Though if I had a choice between getting hit with another paintball and watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu again, I would brace myself for the stinging.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nWhere to even begin?\\n\\n\r\nAoharu x Kikanjuu is a drama. Ironically, that is one of the anime\u2019s biggest problems. The setting and subject matter, while filled with adrenaline, is not an intense pastime. It is not supposed to be taken extremely seriously. But the anime refuses to follow this sentiment. Instead, the show takes this fun and nonlethal activity and turns it into the most over-the-top and overly dramatized piece. The show always showcases the events, such as the main competition or a duel in the woods, as life-or-death scenarios, contrasting too heavily with the fun hobby that the characters partake in. The anime tries so hard to be dramatic but because the subject matter is not as emotionally-driven as it believes itself to be, the result is the feeling that something is off. That something is just not working.\\n\\n\r\nThis feeling persists throughout the entire season because Aoharu x Kikanjuu almost exclusively focuses on drama. Said drama permeates everything; whether it is Matsuoka pushing Tachibana out of a door or Yukimura arguing with Matsuoka, the anime always grossly dramatizes whatever happens to exist on screen. Comedic bits exist, but these moments are quick interjections rather than a focal point. The comedy works better than the drama, but since the drama comes off as awkward, the comedy is unable to act as the buffer it was designed to be. Thus, instead of resting alongside the drama, the comedy is jarring, breaking what was already hurting.\\n\\n\r\nBut the drama being as ineffective as it is does not explain why the drama itself turns out that way. So, what is causing the show to, figuratively speaking, shoot itself in the foot? This leads into the second problem: the monologues. The plurality is slightly misleading; there are more monologues in Aoharu x Kikanjuu than there are guns in the anime. That is a lot of time spent on monologues. Yet, again, monologues on their own are not inherently negative. In fact, monologues are often nice ways of conveying the inner thoughts of a character that might normally be impossible to hear. Aoharu x Kikanjuu, however, does not use monologues of this kind regularly. Instead, the anime opts for the messiest options. Tachibana will commentate on the most obvious of happenings. She might raise questions that the audience is already pondering. Or she may recount, word for word, what she is about to do or what someone else has done or felt. In short, the anime does the complete opposite of the \u201cshow; don\u2019t tell\u201d philosophy by constantly telling everything that is going on, at all times. This stream of monologues is not only relegated to Tachibana. Matsuoka, Yukimura, and even some of the unimportant side characters frequently describe exactly what is going on around them, to the point that the audience would not even have to be watching the anime in order to understand what is occurring on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe third problem also explains why the heavy drama never seems to act as intended. Flashbacks are rampant throughout the season. Much like the monologues, flashbacks on their own are not an issue. They are used to reveal the pasts of characters to develop said characters or to present events outside of a chronological order. That is to say, flashbacks, when used correctly, serve a wonderful purpose. Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not use flashbacks correctly. Instead, almost every single flashback is used to recount a specific moment from the season. A character said that one thing? Flashback. Someone is trying to remember what happened during the match? Flashback. Currently in a battle? Flashback. There are some nice uses of flashbacks within the anime \u2013 Tachibana\u2019s best friend has a flashback that encourages Tachibana to move forward and Matsuoka\u2019s character is largely developed through flashback. But the vast majority of the flashbacks exist as nothing more than unnecessary interjections that chop up the events portrayed and, subsequently, prevents the drama from being as emotional as it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nArguably one of the most important plot points \u2013 the reason for the disbandment of \u201cToy Gun Gun\u201d \u2013 is based on a flashback. More specifically, it is initially given as a false flashback. Lying is a staple theme in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, evidenced by Tachibana\u2019s gender-hiding ruse. Her lie shapes the way the plot progresses. She is let onto the team because she lied, she is motivated by the original lie, and she loses the main tournament because of her lie. Her lie is a white lie but it permeates the anime from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, it is not inconceivable to assume that the show handles this theme appropriately, but the fourth problem is encountered instead. Aoharu x Kikanjuu strangely concludes without Tachibana coming clean. A lot of fuss about her predicament is brought up as the show nears its end. It seems as if the anime is going to reach the type of resolution befitting the show\u2019s own ideas. But no. The anime elects to keep the lying. Despite Yukimura explaining what really went down years ago. Despite the enemy not revealing her secret so that she could tell them herself. Despite the countless opportunities she had to tell her comrades and friends the truth. The anime ends with the group determined and closer than ever, yet Tachibana\u2019s lie still persists, making the whole lying concept more of an aside rather than the important motif it was meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is it that Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not bring closure to its theme? The main reason is to leave it up in the air as a possible point of contention in a continuation. This, quite frankly, is cheap. Her lie is a major plot point that is leaned on constantly throughout the season but is ultimately quasi-closed \u2013 Tachibana is hopeful that a future chance will arrive for her to finally reveal who she really is, but the audience never sees said chance. This highlights the fifth and final problem of Aoharu x Kikanjuu\u2019s narrative: the inept handling of specific scenes. The ending is only the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnother weird moment is when the anime emphasizes a seemingly important character at the caf\u00e9 Tachibana, Midori, and Fujimon visit. His face glowers at the mention of \u201cToy Gun Gun\u201d because he is, presumably, the second member to have voluntarily left the group (before Tachibana and after the first girl). But nothing ever happens with this man. He does not show up again let alone has a role in the narrative. Another example is the main tournament, TGC. There is a ton of build-up to the tournament, such as its purpose, its meaning, and so on. Furthermore, most shows would have the two rivals square off at or near the end in order to build even more tension. But in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the battle happens in the very first round. The audience does not get to the see the TGC event at all, reducing the overall amount of gunplay shown and the overall amount of tension. Then, when Tachibana, Matsuoka, and Yukimura lose, the anime skips ahead, ruining the pacing that had already been established. These two examples are the most egregious in terms of breaking the narrative, but there are other examples. The ridiculous gun duel at Matsuoka\u2019s place of work and Tachibana walking into a hospital with a large black bag that contained her (fake) gun are more instances where the anime simply does not make sense.\\n\\n\r\nFive major problems in total for Aoharu x Kikanjuu\u2019s narrative. As they say, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me five times\u2026that is just unacceptable.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Aoharu x Kikanjuu\u2019s strongest facet is the art and the animation that it contains.\\n\\n\r\nThe art especially has an elevated amount of quality. Forested areas are rife with detail, as are the apartments of the characters and the city areas they visit \u2013 the gun shop, a caf\u00e9, and so on. Contrary to the drama\u2019s execution in the narrative, the drama further boosts the art. Sinister depictions of elite gun wielders, shifted camera placements for demented shots, and fluffy edges for the flashback sequences are varied ways in which the anime diversifies its artistic direction. Other examples, such as special particle effects for pellets hitting targets and the menacing eyes and smiles of the characters, further demonstrate how dedicated Aoharu x Kikanjuu is to making its art as dramatic as possible.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation can be hit or miss, but for the most part the anime manages to, once again, use a lot of tricks that make its animation more involved than it otherwise should be. One of the more intricate scenes is when Midori outs Tachibana to confuse her temporarily. When Tachibana gets shot in the head, the anime goes into slow-motion. While slow-motion animation is common, the environment was currently in a thunderstorm, meaning the rain droplets slowed down as well. The rain helps to accentuate the slow-motion, even more so when this effect is used for only a few seconds \u2013 everything is normally animated, the slow-motion is used, then the show snaps back to its normal animation. A sequence like this is rarer, though. Tachibana jumping off of a mini-gun or her flying through the air while shooting her own weapon are nice to see but the anime, due to the constant stream of monologues, has a lot of characters standing around and talking, either to themselves or to the person next to them.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the extent of the actual animation is nothing to scoff at. Despite the more animation-intensive moments being the exception, the anime has its cast running around shooting their guns quite a bit. Not every episode has them taking part in a battle, but enough are present to make the anime feel as if it is focusing on the gunplay. Besides the running and the shooting, characters also have hair, limb, eye, and mouth movements during the season that equate to a higher amount of actual animation and subsequently better overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are the only section of the art and animation that are not as grand. Tachibana, while androgynous in her depiction, is a bit too plain. Beige hair, green eyes, and constant school uniform make her out to have quite the dull design. Matsuoka is handsome, with his spiky blonde hair and pretty face, but this side of him only really comes out when he is on the job. If anyone, though, has an argument for their design, it would be Yukimura. His glasses, black and frazzled hair, and long-sleeved sweater paint him as the recluse that he is. To be fair, when the characters are participating in their survival games, their designs change. Jackets, scarves, and hats replace their regular attire to help the audience understand the transition from normal to game life. These, at the very least, demonstrate that the anime put some thought into the designs of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is technically a realistic setting, so having wacky character designs would go against said realism. However, the lack of aesthetic appeal in the designs does little to improve the impact of the cast, consequently reducing the effectiveness of the drama and therefore the execution of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFor Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the cast once again misses the target so much one would not be mistaken in thinking that this was not an anime about shooting guns.\\n\\n\r\nThe first oddity is the anime\u2019s fixation on obsession. Not with the guns but with the people. Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi each have an unhealthy obsession with the leader of their group, Matsuoka for the former and Midori for the latter two. Fujimon\u2019s is based on a masochistic fetish and Ichi has romantic feelings for Midori. Characterizations, but they are unfounded. Both Fujimon and Ichi never have their backgrounds explored, their infatuation with Midori less a cute connection and more a weird relationship. Yukimura fares slightly better; in the past, he was betrayed by people he thought he could call friends. The only person to stand up for Yukimura was none other than Matsuoka. Yukimura still turns into the loner he is, though. He secludes himself, focusing on his (perverted) work, himself, and, most important to him, Matsuoka, the only friend he could truly call his friend. Thus, his obsession with Matsuoka, while still a bit strange, has some sort of reasoning behind it.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is the extent of Yukimura\u2019s character. Outside of this beginning revelation, he contributes little else besides the occasional perverted joke or plea for help. This affects all of the characters \u2013 nobody seems to have \u201cenough\u201d about them. Matsuoka is known as a swinger of sorts. It is not until the final episode that the audience learns of his fear of rejection. That is why he works as a swinger; surrounding himself with other people compensates for the hole he has in his heart. That is quite the nice character trait in terms of writing. Yet, similar and opposite to Yukimura, this trait is revealed once at the conclusion. Having his last few lines about his person at the end are fine, it is Aoharu x Kikanjuu never hinting at such a deeply troubling issue \u2013 at all \u2013 throughout the season that comes off as sloppy. As if the anime had forgotten to make his character relevant during the season until it was too little, too late.\\n\\n\r\nMidori, unlike both Yukimura and Matsuoka, has a bit more going for him. By day, Midori is a doctor, saving the lives of the people who visit him. By night, Midori reveals his true personality, that of a deranged and psychotic sadist who relishes in the pain of the enemies he \u201ckills\u201d during the survival game matches. He is two-faced, but he understands how to separate his one life from the other. Midori is arrogant, cocky, and manipulative, all of the makings of an evil villain. Though he is not all evil; he guides Tachibana towards fixing her relationship with Matsuoka and, while his crazy actions are in fact insane, his feud with Matsuoka is not entirely his fault. In this way, he is to some degree a complex character.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana is somewhat similar in the sense that she, too, is two-faced. This obviously applies to her gender reversal. She is a girl who acts and looks like a boy, but she is not so much acting as she is just extremely tomboyish. But this also applies to her main characteristic: a passion for justice. Tachibana has an immense sense of duty. She feels it is her responsibility to quell the bad in the world and to let the good rise to the top. Or so it appears. The \u201cjustice\u201d she often invokes is a negative force that consumes her completely to the point that she becomes the very evil she seeks to quash. That is, it is revenge, not justice, that she pursues. Her lying about herself is also not the most justice-esque move one can do, meaning no matter how much good she fights for, her hypocritical nature contrasts harshly with her known behavior.\\n\\n\r\nFor both Midori and Tachibana, there is \u201cmore than meets the eye\u201d, but there is simultaneously nothing else for the eye to meet. The development they receive, especially in Tachibana\u2019s case, is nonexistent. Midori remains more or less the same, conniving man as when he is first introduced, and Tachibana, due to the story\u2019s stalling, never goes through her full arc. She stumbles along the way with the guns and her own determination, but those are dips in the growth graph as opposed to recognizable turning points. Matsuoka and Yukimura already have shown their own incompetence as characters. Adding Midori and Tachibana, the main antagonist and the main protagonist, respectively, into the same category only serves to make the whole of the cast an underwhelming offering.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the separate pairings more closely, a pattern of parallelism begins to emerge. The composition of their groups mirror one another \u2013 two guys and one girl \u2013 as do the personalities of the people that make up said group \u2013 someone obsessed with the leader, a situational lunatic, etcetera. And most important of all, they all share the same passion: survival games. The two groups share a lot of similarities, yet there is a clear distinction between them: one is more successful over the other. Midori and his group have continually won the main survival game event for the past few years, indicating the closeness of their group and the power of their collective abilities. Matsuoka and his group, in contrast, have continually lost each year. Worse still, each time they lose they lose a member. It is three-fold: Yukimura\u2019s abrasiveness towards others, Matsuoka\u2019s own insecurities, and Matsuoka\u2019s rivalry with Midori drive the third teammate away. Matsuoka\u2019s group is never cohesive and always broken. The bonds they share with each other are not taut in the slightest. This is why he and his team fail whereas Midori and his team manage to win. Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi trust one another completely. \u201cToy Gun Gun\u201d does not. Yukimura did not trust Tachibana with their storied past. Tachibana did not trust in Matsuoka\u2019s leadership. And Matsuoka did not trust himself to keep both Yukimura and Tachibana loving the game that he himself had come to love so much.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this all sounds nice on paper, but the execution is a different matter. Even disregarding the lack of depth for Fujimon\u2019s and Ichi\u2019s characters, Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not make this comparison explicit. Individually the cast is placed side-by-side at times, but without the anime increasing the scope of its comparisons, the parallelism it was seemingly shooting for is lost. Furthermore, while the exploration of the relationships between Matsuoka, Yukimura, and Tachibana exist, the same cannot be said for Midori and his friends. Despite how much Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi succeed together, the anime rarely shows how close they are to one another. In fact, Midori takes advantage of Fujimon\u2019s kindness and Ichi treats Fujimon with disrespect, as if their \u201cfriendship\u201d is anything but. Meaning, the parallelism is not lost because it never existed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the cast of Aoharu x Kikanjuu is difficult to justify. Yukimura, Ichi, and Fujimon are clearly lacking strength, Matsuoka\u2019s character is poorly handled, and both Midori and Tachibana, while characterized well, needed more throughout the season. And even though parallelism can be found, it definitely is not working as intended.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for Aoharu x Kikanjuu is rather upbeat, contrasting harshly with the anime\u2019s dramatic mood. Surprisingly, the song is not overbearing due to the mellowness of the singing, once again going against the show\u2019s usual overbearing drama. Still, the song can instill that feeling of longing, coinciding with Matsuoka\u2019s, Yukimura\u2019s, and Tachibana\u2019s own longing for one another. A nice touch is the combination of vocalists that get all three involved in the piece which works well with the guitar and drum beats. Catchiness does not find a home in the first half but it does find one in the second half, making the OP an overall solid offering.\\n\\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for the main ending theme. The ED is a smattering of noise, caused by the erratic lyrics, the tonal shifts, and the likeness in instruments to the OP. Vocal-wise, there is not enough power to match the piece\u2019s sense of regret and eventual triumph, resulting in a dissonance between what is heard and what is felt by the audience. At the minimum, the ED at least contrasts nicely with the OP, providing a wider range of feelings \u2013 regardless of how expertly they were incorporated \u2013 for the audience to experience.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is by far the best part of the sound-work within Aoharu x Kikanjuu, although not everyone gives a grand performance. Mikako Komatsu as Tachibana uses a voice that walks the line between male and female, a perfect fit for the tomboy. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Yukimura demonstrates his chops once more with a reserved and higher-pitched voice to match the recluse and slightly effeminate dude. Tomoaki Maeno as Matsuoka has his moments, such as when Midori confronts him at TGC or is ashamed of his decision-making skills, but otherwise he provides an average performance. The same can be said for Kazuyuki Okitsu as Midori; he has the \u201cholier than thou\u201d way of speaking but does not particularly stick out from the crowd, lessening his role as the main bad guy. Finally, Ryouhei Kimura as Fujimon also deserves a shout-out for his subservient way of speaking when referring to Midori.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the remainder of the soundtrack, the OST is another step down. Jazzy ensembles with blaring trumpets are used for the explanatory moments. Acoustic strings for the uplifting ones. Eerie tones that make the sadder scenes that much more painful. Standard fare for many an anime. Aoharu x Kikanjuu also includes an extra ED \u2013 played precisely once, at the end of the eighth episode \u2013 that is decidedly darker than both the OP and the main ED, fitting snuggly within Aoharu x Kikanjuu\u2019s plotline at that time. And there are, of course, more emotional pieces, such as laidback piano tracks and reminiscing violin ones, all of which aim to achieve the same kind of emotion that the anime sought.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these more emotional pieces follow the show\u2019s execution of its drama, being incapable of invoking the kinds of responses necessary for the scenarios they surround. And no matter which track is listened to, they are highly forgettable. This, combined with the fact that the most important tracks are not as impactful as they need to be, makes the OST lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere was exactly one \u2013 one \u2013 instance in the anime where I derived satisfaction: the scene following Tachibana and Kanae\u2019s \u201crace.\u201d She acts like an awesome friend, a heartfelt message is given, and, best of all, a romance-oriented joke is had. Before and after this scene, I dreaded watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nI hated Tachibana\u2019s persona. I did not much care for her sense of justice and her constant whining. I especially loathed her when she went psycho. It was a combination of the animation, art, and lame way she acted while going berserk. I could not take her seriously when she acted normally, so when she turned into somebody that was even more annoying than she was, I could not stand having or listening to her on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual survival game sequences were boring. I did not find it fun to watch Tachibana or anyone else run around walls, a few metal barrels, and a heaping of foliage just so they could shoot a few BBs that sometimes found their target and sometimes not. For me, watching gun duels is just not exciting. It is a lot of sitting, stalking, and waiting, as opposed to sword duels where swiftness and deftness are valued more. Plus, every move in a sword duel counts. Each move has (literally) more weight. With guns, spraying-and-praying is a way to approach the enemy, one that the anime uses more than a handful of times, and in only a select few instances is hand-to-hand combat relied on. If I was the one doing the firing, then the feeling would most certainly change. But as much as the show tried, I simply could not find entertainment in the survival games they showcased.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not the end of the torment for me, though. Midori\u2019s impeccable behavior \u2013 where he does everything right and can never do any wrong, no matter what happens \u2013 is a character trait that immediately gets on my nerves. All of the monologues were grating quite early on, mostly because the anime simply could did not have the right type and amount of emotion throughout. The ending, where Matsuoka suddenly has feelings for Tachibana but he (understandably) has no idea why, is such a cheap way to try to inject some romance into the anime where none was previously present. These nuances range from minor to major, but since they all occurred within the same anime, they compounded to the point that I could almost not care any less about this show.\\n\\n\r\nAoharu x Kikanjuu is survival game drama incarnate. Other than the nice animation and art pieces, the story is awful, the characters are a mess, their designs are usually boring, the music is hard on the ears, and the entertainment is nearly nonexistent. On second thought, make that two paintball hits.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, heavy drama feels unnatural, too many nonsensical internal monologues, misused flashbacks, theme on lying is poorly handled, and specific, inept scenes destroy the narrative\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, artistic direction follows the drama, above average actual animation, and a mix of detailed and boring character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi are very weak, Matsuoka is handled poorly, Midori and Tachibana are okay, and the parallelism between them all needs more attention\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, okay OP, bad ED, bad OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, annoying characters, boring action, and other nuances quickly added up to a miserable experience\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "FIRST OFF: IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU TO WATCH THIS BECAUSE IT'S LIKE OURAN HIGH SCHOOL HOST CLUB, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! \r\nThe show starts off okay. There\u2019s a hot guy, a girl who dresses more or less like a guy, and a cute female friend that the main character is content with protecting. It\u2019s all nice and dandy and the plot gets set up in a way that\u2019s eerily like Ouran High School Host Club. \r\nHowever, by the second episode, the show already takes a downturn. Some behavior just doesn\u2019t make sense, a game is dramaticized, the \u2018being alone with three enemies during agame and they all have fake guns\u2019 scenario is described as somehow \u2018traumatizing\u2019 (come guys, if you\u2019ve ever played even lazer tag y\u2019all know that it\u2019s not scarring in any way, shape, or form). On top of this, characters stop in the middle of fights to have long conversations and the common cliche of trusting people for no reason is overused. And this is only by the second episode! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also very inconsistent and sporadic. By the beginning of the first episode, all of the character development is skipped to make it easy for the writers to not slowly change characters and personalities. Without even showing anything, Hotaru is suddenly obsessed with survival games though we\u2019d only seen her play one. In addition to this, she has a \u2018flashback\u2019 of her teammates congratulating her for her first shot when she already shot the redhead at the end of her first game, after which there was certainly no celebration. \\n\r\nThere\u2019s also some weird fetishs going on that seem to distract from the \u2018plot\u2019 (whatever sorry \u2018plot\u2019 the writer was trying to make here), not to mention the fact that the main character acts like she\u2019s really close with the other boys but still wants them to know she\u2019s a girl, which doesn\u2019t really seem to connect. Just a few minutes after these revelations, Yuki goes bipolar again, Hotaru is trying to hide her gender, and she claims she doesn\u2019t know anything about guns though she just admitted she was obsessed with them. By the end of the third episode, the introduction of the newest character saved the show slightly, but the main character develops new and frankly annoying character traits where she decides that the others are being overpowering and dictators though she is, in truth, the untalented one who has been screwing up the game for them. At this point in the series, I could barely remember anyone\u2019s names, the plot was drab and didn\u2019t make me want to keep watching, and everything was way too overdramaticized. \\n\\n\r\nI understand others are comparing this to Ouran, but I would like to point out that at this point, they were nothing alike. To begin with, I saw someone mention that Tamaki\u2019s dramatic obsession with his club and these characters obsession with the game is similar. However, I beg to differ. While they are both obsessions, Tamaki obsesses over the club because of the fact that he never had a proper family and these friends became so close to him that they were like another family. He never learned how to love someone who he wasn\u2019t related to, so he needs to but some kind of labels on these relationships so that they can\u2019t leave him. However, in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, instead of obsessing over it for a good reason, at this point, all the characters are simply just overreacting for no reason and depending on the game with a creepy need that honestly doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I would understand it if I was a hardcore gamer or into a competitive team sport like in the series, but as a competitive figure skater and martial artist, I haven\u2019t ever been faced with this environment where there\u2019s a war-like environment and all the mental instability blatantly floating around. This is only exemplified when the story about the female teammate comes up. Hotaru acts like she never even knew about this detail and is totally surprised by it. She engages in a two minute story-telling saga on the field (that is highly dramaticized and makes no sense\u2026 would you be that traumatized over getting \u2018killed\u2019 in a game? What\u2019s sadistic about that?) and the \u2018killing\u2019 in the watergun field is all too over the top for my taste. \\n\\n\r\nLiterally this entire series feels like it was written by a five year old. A five year old that was too scared to write a death-heavy show and was a little perverted. So they just greatly dramaticized everything. The sizes of the characters also keep changing. The heights in relationship to eachother fluctuate rapidly, along with the side of some characters shoulders, hands, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy episode 8, however, and the introduction of our antagonists greatly highered my rating for this show. There was a lot of fan service for people who enjoy angst and seeing our favorite characters in pain: so basically people who are a little sick and twisted like I am. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a lot of \u201cyou have to conform to your gender\u201d shit going on that I really don\u2019t appreciate. In all honesty, I ship Hotaru and Kanai more than any other ship in the show. \\n\\n\r\nMidori is honestly my favorite character. Fujimon is pretty adorable. This could\u2019ve easily just been a fetish show for people who like the whole dom-sub stuff or the sadist-maschoshit stuff. I appreciate the fact that Yuki mentioned that he overdramatcized some details; otherwise it would have been much too weird. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme and closing themes are alright, however.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this became a very unorganized rant and I apologize for that. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show if: you really like guns, you like perverted characters, you like sadistic characters, you like the whole dom-sub pain thing, you like survival games but can't stand to see any of your favorite characters die\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if: you were expecting something like Ouran, if you wanted to see something original, if you expected something heartbreaking or heartfelt, if you want emotional drama, if you wanted romance, if you wanted pretty much any logical ships that weren't basically abusive\\n",

But, somehow, each week I was fine with sitting down and devoting however many minutes to watching it. \r\nTo me, the biggest success of Aoharu x Kikanjuu is its ability to not drive people away from it even though it's mediocre as all get out.\r\nThe story moves around too much. Are we seeing a romance? Is this a coming of age? Revenge story? A story about the trials of friendship? You don't really ever know the aim ofthe plot and you keep expecting it to lead somewhere only to have it pull in another direction. Carrots are put on sticks leading you to believe some revelations are coming only to have the carrot pulled away and get a revelation that was only minorly hinted at and doesn't really fall in line with what you'd been told to that point.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, YOU CAN'T DUEL-WIELD THOSE SHOTGUNS!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just so flat. They become archetypes of themselves almost immediately and only one of them ever really makes any strides towards growth. They're the sort of insipid people you want to scream at because almost all of them make poor decisions or fail to communicate with the others. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was one of the better parts of the anime. Even if the character style wasn't the most beautiful thing ever, it was at least a nice thing to look at.",

In fact a got so passed that I went rampage-watching this non-stop, really, all night long, really, couldnt stop myself!\r\nStory - 8: an eight is great, such a fresh fluid plot, but there was something missing at the end (there is probably gonna be a 2 season guess that's why). They made something this amazing around simplyairsoft and friends!\\n\r\n But really, it is so hard for an anime to get me not to drop it in the middle and this one even got me straight going non-stop, therefore this story just have to be really really good somehow! First episode is kind of weird thou.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8: nice colours, well draw, didn't notice anything wrong. Everyone is unique and very pretty, which a plus yay\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8: nothing to say but that ''if I didn't' notice anything wrong, the sound was good\". No irritating voice chars as well.\\n\\n\r\nChar - 9: Loved, loved all the chars, they are all amazing and are not your typical stereotypes that you already had enough of (like, wow!). Just dont give a 10 because the MC has that \"naruto-alike-speach\" and  MENTALIZED drama over everything that well, we all had enough of since it's in every damn anime, but still, she (yep, she; you will forget that it's a she all the time) is not irritanting at all and I just love her (him?) as well u-u\\n\\n\r\nEnjoym. - 9: I'll say this again: this was SO enjoyable that I spent the whole night till dawn because I couldn't make myself stop. If there was season 2 already I would have being watching it right after! \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9: Wanted to give a 10 really, since this type of anime is not even like the ones I'm into, and it surprised me sooooo much! Actually, I started just to see if it was hidden BL (shounen-ai), and although it was not, you can still pretend it is since nobody knows she is a girl yup. Chuuu\\n\\n",

I would say that this show is kind of like Ouran High School Host Club with survival games, but not really. That feeling is only there in the first two episodes and then quickly goes away because it's a show about survival games. Also, it's not as well-written as Ouran.\r\nWith that said, I really did enjoy watching it. It's more of a candy show than anything. The art style is amazing and the fight scenes are exceptionally fluid. Sure, the storyline is nothing to shout about and the characterscould have been written better, but the progression of the plot and the characters' interactions are interesting enough to not really care that there isn't much depth to this series.\\n",

The enemy is preserved as  a douchebag but in reality there is no story whatsoever or scenes that relate to him being a bad person but in reality scenes that show his honest truth.  In the end its al about a girl who is secretly shown as a man toher teem mates so that she could play with them in matches that are hardly shown. Overall it has a basic story without much support or depth that is trying to teach a lesson in never giving up. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nIt is good and normal for today's generations but most of the scenes do not have enough detail or sequences to show a variety of storytelling modes. In general, it has a normal art with no depth. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nAgain the sound is normal with not much exiting soundtrack but soundly matches the visual effects. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThe characters have no unique appearance as they mostly nearly look the same with below normal character visual. All characters are skinny and look the same weight with no depth to how their skin differs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\r\nI sit watching it with a plank face, no emotion is shown in 95% of the time as when there's exciting scenes that you get really exited about but they instantly turn it 360& to turn you completely off and make you angry. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nAs it  revolves around many secrets it has not given answers to many of the questions an audience would ask.  the story is below normal, art is average, sound is poor, characters are poor and the enjoyment is a turn off making it impossible to enjoy as all hope an audience wishes is sadly turned down. \\n\\n\r\nWould i recommend a friend to watch this? \\n\r\nIf the friend is in to gender bender girl dressed as a boy and wants to only see everyday life without any action or mystery being revealed then yes otherwise i'd never look at this again or give it the slightest recommendation whatsoever. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review will be short and have very little to no spoilers, but if there's any, you'll be warned ahead. If you haven't read the plot or watched the anime, here's a summary:\r\n(you can skip this)\r\nAfter moving, Tachibana Hotaru finds herself playing a new kind of survival games with Matsuoka Masamune and Yukimura Tooru. This anime follows her life as she matures, learns about life, her friends and begins to fall in love with the game.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIt's surprisingly unpleasant how we don't see more anime like this. It's funny, fast paced and straightforward, so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't recommend this. The makersdid a great job skipping the unnecessary details whilst allowing you to watch the characters, especially the main evolve and grow. It definitely kept me always coming back for more, and now that this is over, I might want to check out the manga. So, job well done.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThey did a very good job at this, keeping it as similar to the manga as it could get. The fighting scenes and character designs were absolutely well done. You can't even tell that Hotaru is a girl which is a good thing because that keeps you on the same pace as the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 8\\n\r\nAlthough the Opening and the Ending weren't the best in my opinion, I liked the BGM a lot, especially in the fighting scenes. Plus, they brought some great voice actors; I mean Mikako Komatsu is the best at playing both gendered trap characters. (google that if you don't know what it means.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI have 0 complains. Amazing. Absolutely outstanding. You don't usually see such a great main female lead- no, it's almost impossible to find more than 3, and Tachibana was one of them. Not only does she mature quite a lot throughout the show but she shows everybody how bad-ass she is! I was very pleased with everything about her. Her bloodlust is amazing, and she's very strong. On point.\\n\r\nThe rest were all good to me. Matsuoka reminded me of Tamaki from OHSHC and Ichi reminded me of Nobume Imai from Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nVery enjoyable.  It excited me when Hotaru and her team were fighting yet never bored me when they were doing other things. Because this is spoiler-free, you might wonder why I have given this an 8 score, but if you watch it, you'd know.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9- Great\\n\r\nI would've given it an 8 if it wasn't for Hotaru really. She makes everything better. I hope there's a second season.",

            "content": "Aoharu x Kikanjuu is really a hit or miss anime, depending on the audience's preferences. Some viewers may find the whole plot not very interesting and annoying, although others may be captivated. \r\nThe story follows main character Hotaru Tachibana, a girl with strong sense of justice. After a misleading turn of evens, Hotaru ends up joining Toy Gun Gun, a survial games team. \r\nFrom there, the anime goes downhill very quickly. The weakest point of the anime is defiantly its lack of plot. There really is no main goal to be achieved, and the TGC isn't even mentioned until practically halfway through the anime. Themain issue of the anime is Hotaru's gender since TGG doesn't allow female members, which is very stupid. There are several ways that the anime defiantly could have been better, for example, by focusing more on the relationship and rivalry with Midori's team. We were barely introduced to their team and we had no background information on them until the last few episodes of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe main saving grace of the anime for me was probablyy the characters. Toy Gun Gun definitely has one of the most diverse teams I have seen, and the interactions with them are hilarious. Yukimura is defiantly one of the most prominent characters in the anime, and he does a lot for the show. Each character has a unique motive (no matter how stupid or irrelevant, each protagonist still does have or obtain one throughout the series) and personality. The diverse characteristics of each protagonist make the interactions between them very interesting and humorous. The anime does a good job of blending in humor with action, even if it isn't the main focus of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was surprisingly good in my opinion, and made up for the lack of action and suspense during the fighting scenes. The anime was very clean, and the colors blended in nicely depending on the situation. The animation is nothing unique, or has no special features, but it is defiantly smooth in comparison to some action anime where the art is very choppy and poorly done. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and sounds were also very promising, and did not disappoint unlike the lack of a plotline. For me, sound comprises of three main elements: Very good sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack. When it comes to these scenarios I will say they hit these right on, especially with the sound effects. They really captured elements to add suspense and action to scenes even if it was previously nonexistent. The sound effects weren't overused either, but done just well enough so that it really enhanced the anime, and it made things exciting to watch. The voice actors were carefully selected, and I think each did an outstanding job portraying their own character. \\n\\n\r\nFor overall enjoyment, I would say it is not bad, but not outstanding either. I found myself wanting to continue watching in order to see if there was any major character development throughout the season, and for some reason I was captivated by the interesting charisma of each individual character. Although very reluctant at first, I ended up getting into the anime, and I thought it was well done. However there are several flaws that could be fixed that could make the anime be around a 7 or 8. To conclude, I did enjoy the anime, as I got hyped to watch the next episodes, although I felt as if I could have watched another anime that would be more engaging instead.",

Excuse me for my extreme bias but for some reason I really liked this anime.\r\nIts like Interhigh, but with guns.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSo, we have this main character who is a girl and looks like a dude who joins this survival team.\r\nPretty average, ok. But like Tachibana is pretty hilarious and the idea that she's hiding everthing makes it above average. I cannot bring myself to give it a 5 because it was well knit into the whole theme of survival games, but I felt 10 was too high, therefore \"why not settle with 7\"\r\nArt: 10\r\nOK. LIKE THE ART IS AMAZING. Even in the manga itis amazing. The characters are well designed, and the animations are not choppy (unlike some animes I know). And the art really brings out the power that Tachibana has stored in her body and soul. And definitely fits the story and seriousness of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\r\nTo be honest, I do not remember any OST i have heard from this series, but the Opening and Ending were quite memorable , or they just stuck in your head. Also the character voices fit, Tachibana wasnt a squealing female character either and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (biased)\\n\r\nTachibana is hilarious, Matsuoka is just like \"here I'll undress you\" and the audience is screaming somewhere out there. Yuki is cute and like that introverted reliable backstabbing character. (Irony I know). And as for the antagonists.... I mean unless you read the manga the antagonists are really mean, but there was one dude (sorry i dont remember names) in Midori's team (not midori) who was really funny. Most of the characters will end up making you laugh at some point. So why not a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt's hilarious, it mixes some idea of Ouran Host, and the art was amazing. All i would complain about is the OST, but sometimes OST aren't needed for somethings and do forgive me as I watched this anime long ago. The story is well knit into everything and there are close to no holes in the plot since everything is mostly explained if my memory serves me.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Watch it and please enjoy, unless you find Tachibana to be stupid then... idk what to say.",

            "content": "Pizza Review! (I review and describe the anime with a pizza analogy)\r\nAoharu is like a really poorly made pizza. It's under-cooked and wasn't handled with care. For some reason some parts of the pizza was cooked really fast while other parts weren't. It had pretty bland ingredients as well, nothing revolutionary or exotic about it at all. Tasting it made me cringe and I could instantly pin point some of its major flaws. Despite all of this though, I was never bored or disgusted by it to the point of wanting to not finish the pizza. Despite it being poorly made, despite it being handledlousily, despite it having bland ingredients it was still enjoyable. The chemistry they have together did make it fun and while it was trying to make this interesting taste and failed horribly, I was never at any point while eating this pizza not interested in it. It was able to trick me and make me want to try it all.\\n\\n\r\nAoharu is literally a pizza that is hot garbage, objectively it's terrible. It's poorly made. But it was still a nice experience and was enjoyable for what it was. Give it a chance and you might enjoy it, it definitely ain't for everyone though. I do question myself afterwards as to why I actually enjoyed garbage and all I can say is it was a fun shitty pizza.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fun with guns! After several dark and depressing shows including guns this seemed like a breath of fresh air, as it is based around people playing survival games that means shooting each other with toy guns.\r\nThe story tells us the tale of Hotaru Tachibana a girl with a serious sense for justice and possibly mild super-strength, who just happens to look like a boy. One day while trying to help out a friend she makes a complete mess in a club and as compensation has to join the club host\u2019s survival game team. He thinks she is a boy as his team does not allowgirls to participate and so she has to pretend to be a boy. Later on she finds out that he has some deep emotional scaring regarding another team and Hotaru is determined to make him get over it, by helping him win a tournament against that team.\\n\\n\r\nWell the premise seemed fun especially as in the beginning it really looked as the characters are taking this whole survival game thing way to serious. Later on the story really evolved but at the same time became much more boring and not nearly as fun as in the beginning. The more serious the show tries to be the lousier it gets, but when it tries to be funny it can make lough out loud.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the anime is the main character as she is really annoying and not interesting at all. As I had said before she has this extreme sense for justice and when she thinks some injustice is going on she gets this almost superpowers to try to stop the injustice from happening or to punish the ones that caused it. This makes her annoying as she freaks out over practically everything. The final nail in the coffin is that she has this obnoxious voice so that I felt the urge to punch her every time she opened her mouth. To balance her out the other characters are all a lot of fun, especially the third team member Tooru Yukimura who is this creepy adult manga artist, who is always being called a pervert. The \u201dvillain\u201d is interesting as he looks like this nice guy but when he enters the battlefield he becomes this extremely cruel sadist and he even has his henchman/admirer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is adequate, but at no point was I actually impressed by the soundtrack. The opening was awesome but as a counterweight I really disliked the ending so all in all it evens out. The art is much better especially the action scenes which can easily be compared to the best in class. The background are detailed and the people are well designed and recognisable, which is great for keeping track of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Aoharu x Kikanjuu is an all-round pleasing anime but it is nothing to be really excited about so it deserves the rating of a high 6 out of 10. It started out very promising but the way they tried to make everything so serious made the show more of a chore to watch then not. Still it is not all bad and you might not regret checking it out. Check out my other reviews and feel free to leave some feedback so I can improve my future reviews.\\n",

            "content": "To start off, I am a bit lenient on this show because while it didn't manage to irritate me, it still says a massive fuck you you in the face. Now, if you're an anime apologist who can't critique things outside of a little box you've constructed for yourself, then please leave. Now for the rest of us, we all honestly can say this show suuuuuuucccckkkkkkks.\r\nThe story is simple, Tachibana is mistaken as a guy and now she has to go through her survival games and 'drama' with the guy friends, Matsuoka and Yukimura as....a guy. That's it. It never trails off into anything original.We're never given any insight to a richer story or at least interesting history between the characters that would elaborate the simplicity of the premise into something far deeper than we'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in the show is quite average and serviceable at best. Visuals never push your heart strings nor does it flood your eyes with spectacular animation that'll have you grasp onto your seat. It's no Fate Stay Night, that's for sure. Onto sound, you'll never notice it, maybe only when they fight but it won't make much of an impact to the scenes themselves. I'd have to say the opening was the only enjoyable music in the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this show are as 1-2 dimensional as you can get. It fails horribly, horribly, and I'll explain why. Tachibana is the your typical and generic heroine who never actually takes the wheel of the series and steers it into Valhalla. And don't even get me started on Tachibana's blood lust BS in SURVIVAL GAMES, as if she was in ACTUAL WAR and about to kill some people. That shit is more whacked then when Goku gave Cell a senzu bean, and that made more sense and had substance. But Matsuoka has it worse, for someone whom supposedly had a dark past, it's not even impacting nor will you care. The development and reveals we see throughout the show is laughable. The very reason for Toy Gun Gun's 'no girls allowed' rule is a joke because when everything is told to us by Yukimura it's a huge disappointment and underwhelms the series to a blackening shallow void. Yukimura is the only decent character who has some bit of....nah, he's just a tad better than the other two. Before, I said Matsuoka was bad, OH no, I'm just barely getting started, the main antagonists of the series have no fucking purpose or any reason to be in the show. They are assholes, simply, for being assholes. Sure, we see bits of flashbacks of Matsuoka's relationship with Midori, but it doesn't tell us anything. There's no main conflict (please, don't even count the BS TGC moments because that's just BS drama), there's no reason to care at all for anything or anyone. We're given exposition here and there but never anything solid as to what's going on. Why does Matsuoka fear Midori? Show us so that we will care and it will strive us to wanting to see the next episode. Yet it never happens. The flashbacks of the two other Toy Gun Gun members who left basically tell us nothing but that the main cast was in the wrong. No higher cause, or gritty moments, it's just poorly executed melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nEven for all the BS moments in Aoharu x Machinegun, I can honestly say I did enjoy a few scenes in some of the episodes. However, that alone, won't redeem anything this show has done. My overall opinion of this show is it's completely below average, mediocre and it surprises me that so many people like this show, and I cannot see why. Don't bother wasting your time to watch this show, I watch these things so that you don't have to, have a good day.\\n",

The art was good, the characters look good...that's it :(\r\nThe first two episodes were good, but when I got in the third, I was like \"huh?, did I miss something?\" The story was suddenly rushed, you get the feeling of having skipped an episode or two. As the episode progresses, you wish to know the characters better, you've got a lot of \"Why's\" going on your head, and hopes that maybe, justmaybe, the succeeding episodes will answer even just a few of your \"Why's\". Unfortunately, those answers won't be coming to shut your screaming mind, instead, it'll just give you hint, clues, or rather, fill in the blanks, IN OTHER WORDS: IT'LL LEAVE YOU HANGING :(\\n\\n\r\nwell, I got 12 episodes, maybe that's the reason why. I think reading the manga would be better than watching the anime, maybe the manga would give much more justice to this story.

I really like how the serious and tense atmosphere can be so funny because I imagined there'll be a plot twist in the end. I also like when the three of them are becoming more and more solid in every match (even though there's still an error sometimes). It's surprised me to think that the team just formed.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nLike I said I love the comedy of this anime. It is also a good story when the SAVA Gamechanged the main character's life. I also find it's intersting and want to try and even wonder if I can get hooked like Tachibana.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nI'm just going to be blunt, there's so many anime that has a better art than this. You won't find anything through the art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\r\nI think I'm not the only one who mistaken Tachibana as a high school boy (well I didn't read the manga) Oh dear...Komatsu Mikako-san did a good job here. And the way Tachibana address herself as Tachibana is really cute.\\n\r\nThat ero-mangaka made me laugh so much. His character is way more intersting than the rest. I immediately think that he is 'S' when I first saw him. I find it funny when he called Matsuoka Masamune 'Mattsun', since his voice actor had a same name and nickname lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is enjoyable that you'll gonna laugh at the serious moment.",

            "content": "---------------This Review Contains Spoilers.For your own good READ IT---\r\n *Generic Shounen based show till the end!Cringe!Cringe!Cringe!*\r\nFor this one i will start from the characters.The characters are well made with their unique personalities and back stories to explain how the got the way they are.The MC tho...We hardly know anything about him.All in all, the characters are well made,explained,thought and fitting to the main story.\r\nThe story is a pretty simple.After losing a bet our MC is obligated to attain to some games that he soon gets addicted.There is particularly no serious plot or twists. Whatsoever there is a logical development as the story unravels.\r\nThe animation isreally good,beautiful and detailed. You can notice small things like lack of sleep,desperation,frustration and other things that might be trivial, but there are still there and thats something praiseworthy!!\\n\r\nThe comedy is controversial.Someone can easily enjoy it (i personal did) or just get frustrated and loath it.That's why i think its 50-50 and neither good or too bad.\\n\r\nThe music is casual one can say. Nothing interesting or special tho there was actually some effort put in it, its not something worth the attention.However, its one of the few anime that while something big is happening there is a soundtrack playing behind.\\n\r\n--------------------------Personal opinions and flaws------------------------------\\n\r\nOn the other hand, this anime is a generic shounen overload that tries desperately to create a serious atmosphere around some \"harmless\" games.It demonstrate blood-lust,killing intent,superhuman strength and other interesting stuff OVER A GAME. Even if you want to make it serious,no logical person will say \"I will kill you on the field with my beloved toy gun\".My point is that while it tries to be serious everything is completely unrealistic and out of place.Forgot to mention that it does not easy to associate with its Characters and their problems and really hard to approach it even tho its beautifully made(animation wise)...Lastly its not a \"satisfying/enjoyable\" one.Which means it will most likely leave a bad taste in your mouth when you finish it...\\n\\n\r\nPersonally i would only recomment it for its beautiful animation,good fighting scenes (even tho are completely illogical) and semi-good comedy.You will most likely get frustrated right away and try to find a reason not to quit it.\\n\r\nI absolutely regret spending 4 hours watching it since it literally offers you nothing.\\n\r\nReasons to watch it:\\n\r\n-Beautiful animation\\n\r\n-Good characters\\n\r\n-<s&m jokes artist over everything else on that show\\n\\n\r\nWhy did you rated it 3/10 even tho your saying good stuff about it?!!?\\n\r\nBecause ladies and gents no matter how you look at it its a very bad show.\\n\r\nEven tho I recommend it ,its solely due to the fact that a casual viewer can find it very interesting and enjoyable.\\n\r\nA high demanding viewer will most likely find this disgusting and a waste of his personal time.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my Shameless critic.\\n\r\nI am leaving without remorse!",

            "content": "There is a very fine line when it comes to suspension of disbelief. This is especially so when it comes to shows that take place within the real world, or modern day Japan like this particular show takes place. If the suspension of disbelief is pushed too far, the story can become too overblown making the story difficult to take seriously. This can be seen in poorly executed melodramas. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if suspension of disbelief is not pushed at all, then the writer is at risk of boring the readers. Aoharu x Kikanju is one of those shows that pushesthings too far.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise of the show is quite refreshing when it comes to recent shows involving a high school student as a main protagonist. Instead of focusing on school life and clubs our main character, Hotaru Tachibana, finds herself forced into playing survival games after causing major damage to a host club where Hotaru\u2019s now partner, Masamune Matsuoka, works. At first Hotaru is reluctant to take part but over time finds herself enjoying the thrill of the game just as much as Masamune. This in of itself is a fine setup. It is clich\u00e9d and cheesy but it is something but people can relate to and is an entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this point Aoharu x Kikanju takes a drastic turn as the main conflict of the show gets introduced. This plot line goes into explaining why Masamune\u2019s survival game team, Toy Gun Gun, refuses to allow girls in. And this plot line is really out there. The character that is depicted as the main antagonist of the show is psychotic. I am not using hyperbole. He goes out to these survival game events not so much as to enjoy the game but rather to see how much pain and fear he can instill into his opponents. \\n\\n\r\nIn a fantasy or a sci-fi setting I could see this working as the rules of the society are difficult to pinpoint. Aoharu x Kikanju, however, does have these rules and even more so than usual considering the horrific displays of mutilation occur within an organized event. There comes a point where our antagonist has Masamune pinned down on the ground and repeatedly shoots BB pellets into his abdomen while simultaneously stifling his screams of pain with his hand. Surely this is a major breach of ethics within the sport. Surely if Masamune brought this up the tournament organizers could not just brush this under the table. \\n\\n\r\nTo the show\u2019s credit, these scenes of insanity are the most interesting and best looking parts. However, it really just seems like a case of trying to make a show more than what it should have been. What starts off as a fun show about discovering something new and exciting turns into a show about betrayal and seeking revenge jam packed with existential crises about whether or not they should keep playing.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was only one thing that I can really take out of this show it was that Hotaru, Masamune, and everyone else involved really take these survival games way too seriously. Having a strong competitive side is one thing. Boldly exclaiming that you are going to kill someone for what they did while playing a game with nothing but seriousness in tone is another.\\n",

            "content": "I really loved Aoharu x Kikanjuu, I think this was a really good anime and I enjoyed the storyline.\r\nStory: I liked the story overall I liked all the action scenes especially since they weren't that predictable since even though the MC could be OP it's not one of those animes where they win everything still, the  MC still loses. I didn't really like how whenever there was a conflict between the team they would make up like 5 minutes later...Or that the MC wouldn't listen to their team at times and would do whatever they wanted.\r\nArt: I really liked the art, especially when theMC has a look of \"bloodlust\" I think that was really cool during those action scenes where they would go all out. I like that they put a lot of detail into their outfits and weapons as well, and didn't just do really simple outfits or something. I also like how at the end of the intro it shows a scope.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I love the intro I don't think I ever skipped it. I can't really remember but I'm pretty sure they put a lot of sound into the action scenes, of course with the weapons, but footsteps and everything as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think all the characters were pretty enjoyable, I like how the MC is actually a girl and can be tough, and the rest of the characters on the team say they won't allow girls on their team, but since they don't know that the MC is a girl they actually find them to be strong at some points and proves them wrong. I also like some of the characters have a split personality from when they're playing the game compared to their daily lives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime, I think it was pretty good, besides a few minor things I think that all the action scenes made up for it, although I do kind of wish the action scenes were real not just some kind of game, it would be a lot more interesting then, but it's also interesting to see them climb to the top as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Pretty much everything was fine, the only things I didn't like was that the MC sometimes didn't work with the team well and would go off on their own, and I wish that I could've seen what would've happened when the MC told the rest of her teammates that she was a girl, it just kept stalling the whole season and wasn't even mentioned in the last episode, which was kind of disappointing. Other than that, because I enjoyed it so much, I still think that it deserves a 10.",

            "content": "I stumbled upon Aoharu x Kikanjuu on complete accident when trying to figure out what to watch on Hulu.  I hadn\u2019t heard anything about it and the art caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try.\r\nAoharu x Kikanjuu follows Hotaru Tachibana, a girl who gets mistaken for a boy almost continuously, as she ends up getting drawn into the world of survival games.  What I enjoyed is that these aren\u2019t your average survival games where their actual lives are on the line for some reason or another.  These survival games are fought with airsoft guns.  I thought itwas innovative; it had all the action and suspense of an actual gun wielding anime without the numerous causalities.  So, I thought this anime did well.  It caught and maintained my interest throughout.  It had its flaws of course, but I still enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nWhat I loved the most was the different twist on the \u201csurvival game.\u201d  Instead of actual death, it\u2019s all an airsoft game.  Of course, some people criticize that this anime depicts airsoft poorly (I do not know anything about airsoft), but of course anime over-exaggerates.  All those sport anime don\u2019t actually portray what those sports are like in real-life, but we still love the anime.  I felt that way about this airsoft-survival world we were given. \\n\r\nAnother big aspect of this anime was the \u201cgender bender,\u201d which can get a little dull and ridiculous in my sole opinion, but this one handled it well.  The main character, Tachibana, does not dress like a boy, yes she wears slacks, and has short hair, a long with a small chest, but she is not trying to be a boy.  She just happens to prefer that style and everyone mistakes her for a boy.  That\u2019s a huge difference to me than normal gender benders.  Also, with gender benders, it usually leads to awkward romance stories.  This did not have that.  This story focused on friendship, not romance.\\n\r\nThe story does feel very fast paced and even though it\u2019s a survival game anime, you don\u2019t get much of the games.  This anime had 12 episodes and instead of giving you more of the airsoft games you have more character interactions and the general world of airsoft.  I, for one, wish they had given just a bit more of the games because they were awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThere are only 12 episodes so character-development didn't really happen in this anime.  It\u2019s a shame, because I feel like they could have done a lot, but they didn\u2019t fit it in.  However, the characters themselves are interesting.  You have a bunch of characters with twisted personalities, some more sinister and others more perverted.  Either way I loved the sudden shifts in personalities, especially with main characters.\\n\r\nThe backstories for some characters were given in brief tidbits, but a lot was left unexplained.  That\u2019s one of my biggest problems with the anime.  They give you bits of backstory that could be really interesting, but they skim over it or bury it like it doesn\u2019t really matter.  Again, only so much you can do with 12 episodes, but the lack of explanation really irked me.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was gorgeous.  Just awesome.  The action scenes were so cool and I loved how they depicted airsoft war play.  I wish they had more of it since it was so good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was fast-paced, but I enjoyed it and easily binge watched the season.  It\u2019s the type of anime that pulls you in, shows you something new, and entertains.  I personally enjoyed it very much.  It\u2019s the type of anime I want to see get a second season, and if not, I\u2019ll gladly go find the manga to see where the story goes from here. \\n",

            "content": "I began watching this series because I'm always open to a fun gender-bender and this one looked especially good.  The characters looked interesting.  The main character, Tachibana Hotaru, especially caught my eye because she looked so cute and sporty.  The premise also seemed promising since I don't know anything about survival games but I love learning about sports and combat.  With all these interesting components lined up, it seemed it would be impossible for the anime to lose my interest.\r\nHowever, be warned, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is not the action/gender-bender/sports anime it promises to be.  Knowing that the series only had12 episodes, I expected a fast-paced action series about Hotaru's predicaments and the sport of survival games.  It is in reality, a slow-moving, sappy drama about friendship with absolutely no central plot to propel the action forward.  For that reason, the series stagnates around episode 7 and becomes unwatchable by the time it ends.  Nothing is resolved.  Even the most important aspects of the \"plot\" are left unresolved. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is mostly the premise.  Our heroine Tachibana Hotaru becomes indebted to her neighbor and pays him back by joining his survival game team, Toy Gun Gun.  Her two team members have no idea she is a girl.  She becomes addicted to the sport and enters a tournament with her team.  She goes up against the team's main rivals and this is the climax of the show which is actually very well-executed.  There isn't really anything in the plot besides that.  The show tries to throw in a few dark, dramatic turns later in the series, but none are of great consequence. Surprisingly, unlike most gender-benders, this anime had almost zero romance.  I actually enjoyed the first half of the series, but the second half was one of the most puzzling and disappointing I have ever seen in an anime.     \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Hotaru, is motivated by a sense of justice.  I liked her character overall, but got annoyed by her black-and-white sense of morality.  The other characters are interesting but nonetheless flat.  The leader of the team, Matsuoka works as a host and the other, Yukimura, is an adult manga artist.   Midori is the leader of an opposing team.  He has a messy history with Matsuoka and Yukimura which is never clearly explained.  \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime three stars for the three positive things I found in the anime.  The first one is the character Yukimura.  He was the only bright spot in the anime.  His character could have been rounded out more but overall, his character was original and charming.  Some might find his character offensive and I totally get that, but he was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe second was learning about the survival game.  I was excited for this anime because none other that I know of are about survival games.  The first few episodes focus on techniques and strategy, and I found that very interesting.  It made me want to get into the sport myself.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the climax where the team competes in the tournament  is easily the best part of the show.  If there was more of that, the show would have been rated much higher.  After the tournament, the story dissolves in needless angst and drama.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first this anime is marked as shounen so I'm gonna consider it as shounen no shoujo anime. Well then about story and sound I can't say anything good or bad. It was casual, nothing special, but also I don't think it was bad in some way.\r\nStory is... bad. Of course there is that TGC (teoretically not so popular topic) but it's a trick (just like time travel in \"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo\" shoujo as well). They focus mostly on main character emotions and relations with hunk and hunk's friend so it's getting some mishmash with little of romance.\r\nAbout characters we have some mad chickwho's acting boy, some hunk with dark past, retarded wierdo and really, really bad guy (is he bad?). His evilness is forced. They wanted tangle Midori and Matsuoka past and make some depth into the plot. When story doesn't tange by itself I think it's bad idea to force it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: IT'S SHOUJO anime. We have a girl and dark past hunk. She must lead him to the right path. I was suspicious from the beginning but at first I trusted MAL and later I decided to finish it just to close the story.\\n\r\nShortly I don't recommend it for men weak, forgetable story, dull characters and most important it's addressed to girls eventually to young women (or if I'm wrong it's addressed to anyone).",

            "content": "Tachibana Hotaru joins Team Toy Gun Gun, the BB gun (those air guns with plastic bullets) team of Matsuoka Masamune and Yukimura Tooru. From there, they participate in a team-oriented BB gun tournament.\r\nI thought it was a fresh concept, as this is the first anime I have seen that's about BB guns. I also liked it because I'm a fan of team-oriented battles, especially ones where the members must be eliminated. Content-wise, I felt the show was very much lacking. But I do hope that this show inspires more authors to make BB gun anime. In that sense, this show was a step in theright direction.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to people who like team-oriented battles and BB guns. To those who are looking for good and rich plots, unfortunately this show would be a bust. Also, Hotaru is a trap, or rather reverse trap. So fans of traps/reverse traps can check this show out too.\\n\\n",
