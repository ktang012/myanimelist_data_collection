            "content": "I tried to like this. I really, really did. I was even sticking out for it upon its announcement because for all of the problems earlier iterations of SAO had, there was always a sense that, if the finer details were checked over and looked at in complete retrospect of what came before, it could be deservedly fun, inspiring or genuinely meaningful. A series deserving of the immeasurable hype phenomenon it generated. Escapism, blurring between actions of reality and fiction was always a thematic that separated the series from the many isekais this decade that followed in its footsteps, and something that held my interestin how it would be handled, but aside from arguably the Mother\u2019s Rosario arc, this wasn\u2019t given enough space in the narrative between all the superfluous anime tropes that seem to be there to draw the most general audience possible. Look no further than the original Aincrad arc, praised most by anime-only fans for its concepts, but forcibly rushed to completion when its author chose to submit a word limited contest draft as the first novel, compared to refining the fully story he wanted to make.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online\u2019s biggest problem is itself. \\n\\n\r\nIts writer, Reki Kawahara, keeps getting in his own way, and when he doesn\u2019t, the anime eschews his vision. What he wants to get across is almost always clear, and there are effortful attempts, but with the anime\u2019s focus on moving the plot forward rather than making details feel elaborately set, it ends up bringing down the entire experience to make watching the series weekly for the most part, feel like a slog of boring exposition attempting to cover up the poor pacing of external events. If something from earlier is justified, it can feel annoyingly retroactive. Even when Kirito himself is less a factor than in previous arcs, he is still partially to blame in the indistinct coverage of how this season adds to the themes of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral spoilers for the season below:\\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of this arc is that Kirito, while on a date with his girlfriend Asuna, is caught off guard and stabbed to near death by one of the three Death Guns from the previous season. While in a coma, he ends up in the digital world of Rath, a system used for a military experimentation project where he must do..............................nothing in particular at no real urgency. There is a plot, and there is a goal, but for once they feel entirely separate from the tension.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll get to that later. SAO, being as popular as it is, has mostly being met with snark and derision from people calling it the \u201cworst ever\u201d or otherwise exaggerating the flaws of it, so I think it\u2019s fair to start off with the positives of this season, because contrary to what haters will tell you, they do exist.\\n\\n\r\n1. Production value and music. These have been consistent strengths of the SAO series throughout the years and generally, they still hold up here. The character models take on the new polished style from the Ordinal Scale Movie, and while not having as much animation (I\u2019ll get to that), the look is maintained very well across all 24 episodes of the show. If you compare to the original two seasons, there is a definite improvement, and while the architecture present isn\u2019t particularly unique or standout, it is well presented. Likewise, Yuki Kajura\u2019s music, while not her best soundtrack, still does what it can to set the mood for the quieter scenes and the action scenes, with a new remix of Swordland to go along with it. Special mention to some of the opening moments of Episode 2, and the fight in Episode 16. Of the music outside of the show, the first OP and the second ED are the best ones and do have a good amount of catchiness and energy to them.\\n\\n\r\n2. Alice Schuberg, the arc\u2019s new female lead. While it takes 16 episodes in to actually really explore her as a character, and she looks a lot like Saber from the Fate series, the time we do have from then on with her sets her as probably the most consistent female lead in SAO so far. As of yet, she\u2019s hasn\u2019t been subjected to an endless supply of ass shots, her growth hasn\u2019t been stunted by time skips, nor is her growth entirely for Kirito\u2019s sake. Her arc of rejecting the corrupt system she\u2019s been brainwashed under, wanting to reconnect with her old life and opening up on her feelings is adequately handled and leads to some of the stronger character moments this season. She also has one of the coolest weapons in terms of both design and animation; a space bending sword acting as moving protection with golden butterflies as weapons. It\u2019s been put to effective use in the fights so far and has potential to be used further as the story moves along.\\n\\n\r\n3. Measuring Kirito\u2019s power. Compared to say, the Phantom Bullet arc, some of the worst aspects of his character are toned down. He doesn\u2019t start the series overpowered from the get-go, has actual struggles in several fights and even takes a few Ls in a couple of them. It gives a couple of the fights in the season more tension than previous ones. The existence of Eugeo also helps for his sake since the show is better able to balance the battles between the two of them rather than giving Kirito the entire spotlight. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still an annoying amount of contrived solutions to conflicts, but that\u2019s more on the writing than him specifically.\\n\\n\r\n4. Actually building the villain. The arc\u2019s villain, a Knight Templar dictator calling herself Quinella, has an established backstory and a defined reason for ruling the way she does. We know why she is the villain, we see the clear consequences of her actions on the world and she isn\u2019t too laughable to be taken seriously. She\u2019s a product of an as of now unknown evil seed, but nonetheless she\u2019s established properly, even if showing her attractive naked body on screen constantly doesn\u2019t work to be alienating for a series that in the past used naked bodies during bath scenes as fanservice. At least her fight with Kirito near the end is mostly entertaining and well matched. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s the positives out of the way. Now for everything else that really breaks this arc and saddens me given the inherent potential of a SAO story.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem that persists throughout the entire show is the immeasurable focus on exposition over every other element. Characters will abandon the idea of development, fighting, talking, world building, or anything else for the opportunity to talk in technical terms about topics that, while somewhat relevant, are not as important as what else could be focused on. Eugeo, the new male lead, has got family issues? No, that's not important. We need to talk about the villain\u2019s plan and \u201cFluctlights\u201d (the series\u2019 pretentious name for digital souls in an indistinct coverage of AI vs humans) again. Knowing how that works is way more important that a main character's backstory. The exposition often brings the narrative to a screeching halt, especially in scenes where the heroes stop fighting the villain and exposition for a few minutes while the villain just stands around waiting for them. \\n\\n\r\nExposition is something inherent in building a setting and establishing the plot. I understand the use for it. There are several shows that have still been entertaining despite or because of their exposition. But SAO Alicization\u2019s exposition is not only incredibly frequent but boring and lacking in character. It\u2019s frequent enough to where Episode 1 spends 10 minutes just expositioning off vague terms about the setting, while half of Episode 12 and nearly all of Episode 13 are nothing but this flat delivery of the plot. Other episodes tend to tag nearly every fight with exposition that\u2019s 8 times longer than the fight itself. While the old director was no exemplar by any means, he at least knew how to make fights seem varied and exciting visually with a lot of movement. Here, Yuki Kajiura puts in the effort, but this new director who directed some of the worst LN adaptations in recent memory like Mahouka and The Asterisk War, just cannot pull it off. So, when the OP makes you think you\u2019ll be getting this epic fight, it\u2019s usually just maybe two attacks apiece preceded and followed by 5-10 minutes of exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe framing device of the season also presents several issues this time around. The idea that Kirito\u2019s exploration in this new world is happening while his real-world body is comatose could generate tension, but this alongside Kirito\u2019s connection to the real world is poorly substantiated. In learning about this framing device, we, as the audience, know it is just a waiting game for Kirito to heal up and be back to normal. Until the very last episode, his actions in Rath have absolutely no consequences in the real world. None of that \u201cdie in the game die in real life\u201d stuff here. He gets really hurt from time to time but we have no idea how his real body is taking it. There\u2019s a two-year timeskip at one point, but unlike in Season 1 where it really was two years, we have no idea how much the time exchange is between the system and the real world which I think hurts the connection to the story. This framing device also separates Kirito from his past connections in this story. I don\u2019t mind the reduced role of his entourage for the moment (even if Asuna, who SHOULD be important, has nothing to do right now), but he barely brings them up over what\u2019s been at least two years. There was one moment Kirito thought of his real-world connections, but that was for a poorly animated fight that ended in a draw and had absolutely no effect going forward. Kirito cries more over the fact that flowers he planted were destroyed (that were contrivedly brought back anyways) than even the chance that he might NEVER see Asuna again being stuck for so long. I want to care, but the show refuses to let me with a framing device that undermines the events and severs past connections.\\n\\n\r\nOther old habits die hard, whether because of Kawhara\u2019s own writing or the adaptation. Not only do we get another ridiculous rapey scene, but there\u2019s a two-year timeskip rather than say, actually seeing Kirito and Eugeo train up to be better swordsman. They set off for the Capital and the next we see them, BOOM, two years pass, and they\u2019ve already had a lot of training done. They could\u2019ve at least done an FMA03 type thing by building character relationships prior to a timeskip but nope, nearly all relationships at the sword academy are shown after and as of now, doesn\u2019t matter to anything since we know so little about them. If this was better in the light novel, good for Kawahara, but perhaps it should\u2019ve been a cause for concern seeing how much got cut for the anime onlys. In this adaptation, the only purpose of the sword academy stuff, aside from telling us Kirito and Eugeo became better swordsmen offscreen, was to build two bullies as irredeemable rapey monsters, and paint two cute girls as victims of this. We don\u2019t know much about them either, aside from one of them having a romance arc with Eugeo that goes absolutely nowhere. There\u2019s also a lot of contrivances to make progress, like with Kirito seeing the \u201cghost\u201d of Alice in Episode 4 lead him the right way, how Cardinal is introduced into the story specifically to ex Machina Kirito and Eugeo out of a scene, and how Kirito uses a completely unknown attack to one shot a late-game villain that returns him to his Black Swordsman coat for a bit. This attack is never referred to by name and never mentioned again. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not like this progress has done well for the characters, as Alice aside, they range from passable to horribly flat. Kirito isn\u2019t as overpowered as before, but aside from problems the framing device puts on him, he still has annoying moments, like one case where he retroactively Sherlocked his way to avoid being poisoned, or where he used a device he only had two of on a character he barely knew, rather than to potentially stop the villain and save Alice. The show puts him in the right for this by the way, and there\u2019s not much of an arc for him this season either. Cardinal is actually pretty decent, even if the show\u2019s use of her as an ex Machina isn\u2019t for the best. The sword academy characters are barely developed at all, and among the antagonists, only Bercouli and Deusolbert are passable; the rest are just obnoxious. Fanatio\u2019s only character trait is being ashamed of being a woman, which falls deaf when both the main villain and Alice, whom she knows personally, are also women, as well as there being no indication of gender division in the world. And Chudelkin\u2019s only purpose is to ruin the tone and make rapey faces whenever possible until kill stealing at the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to the biggest wasted potential so far, Eugeo. There was a lot of potential for his character at the start. Being a guy partner to help balance Kirito out of the spotlight, there was a lot Kawahara could do with what he distinctly did not know about Kirito, his personal relationships with him and Alice as kids, his fighting ability, the idea that he has more innate fighting potential than Kirito, his unawareness of being an AI program and his romantic relationship to Tiese. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not one of these elements get to shine in this adaptation to let us in on his blank sheet personality. Perhaps improved in the light novel, but the anime should have better stood on its own. Him having more innate potential than Kirito is completely ignored later on, his sword training is told not shown, and anything the show tries to pull regarding his relationships with Kirito/Alice as kids, his family, or Tiese fall completely deaf because they received little to no focus. The show would rather go into long tirades of exposition than show a main character\u2019s backstory! Near everything about him was entirely cut short by the show despite having more than enough time to act on all of it. They try their best to make up for it at the end, but it\u2019s a bit too little too late.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether I\u2019m more annoyed or disappointed with how Alicization has been executed so far. Sure, some of the problems in the world, characters and framing device can be fixed going forward, but first impressions are everything and this series did not make a good one. The focus on constant exposition over all else, the disconnected framing device, and lackluster character writing drag it down more than needed, but it could\u2019ve been avoided if Kawahara just knew what to focus on or the anime didn\u2019t skim over the better parts, since his ideas are abundantly clear. The SAO franchise can theoretically explore a lot, but it almost deliberately gets written into corners. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always given SAO over the many works that have almost no effort at all to act on their ideas, and though there\u2019s that chance for the future with new elements coming in to make the second half an improved experience, this season\u2019s quality suggests it won\u2019t be without a wide range of caveats.\\n",

            "content": "In a world where popular light novels gets anime, manga, games, and hell, even live action movies, there\u2019s one title I\u2019m sure no anime fan can ignore. Sword Art Online. Becoming ever more popular and entering a mainstream line of anime adaptations, the franchise has also no doubt sparked decent deal of controversy. But hey, controversy sometimes makes cash right? \r\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to realize SAO would eventually get a continuation. It was just a matter of when and after 5 years since the second season, the time is now. Sword Art Online Alicization covers the light novels with an extended amount of material,much more than the previous season. It\u2019s so much that in fact, a full 2-cour season of 24 episodes isn\u2019t enough. Luckily, it has been confirmed the series would run more than that and given an additional season for its adaptation. However, the big question people should ask themselves if this is another SAO show to jump into or a cash grab at making more money.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the prologue, we get a double length episode to give a general background of the new season. Make no mistake though as Alicization is not going to spoonfeed viewers with recapping. The show assumes you are familiar with the first two shows so anyone hoping to watch this needs to have completed the first two seasons. Light novel adaptations tends to suffer a lot from adaptation standards but thankfully, Alicization manages to deliver a faithful start with its character cast and storytelling. Besides Kirito, we are introduced to Eugeo, a new character who serves as his partner and best friend in this arc. Similar to Kirito, he has a kind heart although lacks experience in the beginning compared to him. He also appears somewhat cowardly in the beginning as he is unable to prevent certain events from happening, in particular for failing to help his childhood friend Alice. It\u2019s not until he meets Kirito that he develops a resolve and finds the courage to become a stronger person. That is to say, Alicization features a lot of character bonding especially in the first half of the show. Eugeo begins to grow out of his shell after training and becoming strong enough to fight as a warrior. It really shouldn\u2019t take long to realize that he has great potential, perhaps even someday of surpassing Kirito himself. As for Kirito, his personality remain largely the same in this season. That is, he is a selfless person who isn\u2019t afraid to help others in need. Kirito and Eugeo develops great respect for each other and the latter even finds his resolve. The two sometimes almost feel like brothers. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the duo, you may have noticed another prominent character being featured in the trailers or key visuals. Alice would be her name and she is Eugeo\u2019s childhood friend. The show makes it clear that she is an important character from her introduction to later on in the story. Alicization also devotes time to developing her character after meeting Kirito. Despite having a rocky start, she develops respect and a growing trust for him. Now, people may have a curiousity if Alice become another \u2018harem girl\u2019 similar to some of the previous seasons. SAO is not a harem although it gives off a stench at times. Thankfully, there\u2019s no need to worry. The closest that Alice seems to be with Kirito is when they are at the tower during one of the episodes and nothing more comes out of it. On the other hand, Kirito\u2019s friends from the real world are still concerned about his well-being. In particular, Asuna searches for him through unorthodox methods while discovering some revelations about the technology in the real world. Remember, the world of SAO contains complex technology that defies the law of nature. I\u2019m not even referring the VR system or robotics but rather the capability of influencing people\u2019s lives. This extends to the virtual world where the Administrator managed to use system commands to reverse her own age. Sounds unbelievable, right?\\n\\n\r\nAs with previous seasons, Alicization can\u2019t be complete without antagonists and conflicts. One of the major antagonist in the new season is the Administrator, Quinella and her Integrity Knights. She\u2019s an important character as not only is she a threat to the main protagonists but also a catalyst for some of the key events in this season. This includes character manipulation that extends to our new characters such as Eugeo and Alice. I\u2019m not going to lie though, one of the events in this show is rather disturbing to watch considering the way she manipulates others. (I\u2019m looking at you, Eugeo) On even more disturbing matters, we even have characters that commits unforgiveable sins that pushes Eugeo to the edge. It\u2019s the type of event that brings controversy out of its fullest. I\u2019m not going to spoil it but when you get to that particular episode, you\u2019ll feel disgusted too. It\u2019s so disturbing that it even changes Eugeo\u2019s views on the laws of their world and causes him to rebel. Quinella herself also demonstrates a God-like complex with her own dark motives. If I said it once, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times. She is detestable. I doubt anyone with a sane mind would find her character likable. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t be the only one to notice that the animation quality improved more than the previous seasons, right? The Ufotable-like animation is used in parallel with the Sword Art Online movie, Ordinal Scale. Not only did the animation style improve, it also managed to craft an imaginative virtual world to it its fullest. The character designs are also featured in great details compared to previous seasons. In particular, Alice is important to note for her chivalrous look and golden armor. Character expressions are meaningful with an emphasis put on human emotions. Eugeo is a prominent example especially as his personality shifts from a weak survivor to a noble swordsman. While I\u2019m not impressed by how antagonist are portrayed this season, they were able to deliver their dialogues straight with a degree of villainous expressions. Quinella is the biggest culprit with her manipulative personality. Her malevolence simply cannot be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe SAO franchise is one of the longer light novel running adaptations that continues to build more into its universe. Truthfully and despite some of the controversy from the past seasons, this one managed to finally jump out of its rabbit hole and deliver what I wanted to see. With another season on the way, I cross my fingers that it will ride on this momentum.",

            "content": "The anime community seems to be split in its opinion on SAO. Half of them ignore everything positive about it and only talk about negetive things. The other half just does the opposite. No other anime has been this controversial for more than 5 years after its original release. Now here is a new season that features mostly different cast from the original. So is it worth watching or not? Here is my analysis:-\r\n**THIS WILL INCLUDE MINOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE OVERALL SETTING **\r\nThe story this time is centered not on a game, but around a simulation of civilization. The aim of this simulation is todevelop highly advanced A.I capable of thoughts and emotions. It brings about some ethical questions about humanity, playing God, and where to draw the line in scientific experiments. This season deals with more of these mature themes than the previous seasons ever did.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that Kirito finds himself in a medieval world with its own history and lore and journeys with his newfound friend Eugeo to achieve both of their (different) goals. It starts out slow, with a lot of focus on world building. Even though it seems disconnected to the plot of the previous seasons, eventually many plot points from before will make their way into the story. So it is important to watch the last seasons to get a full understanding of the current season.\\n\\n\r\nEugeo is the focus of these two cours, Kirito just tagging along. He has an innocent, easygoing personality that makes the story work - much like Frodo from Lord of the Rings. He is the embodiment of a common citizen of Underworld. His opinions about himself, others and the society he is in changes throughout the story and the viewers get to experience the same things he does. Alice has not much role in the initial part, but her time for development will come in the 3rd and 4th cours.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike SAO's history, there is pain and blood in the fights. It makes the characters' struggle believable and makes you root for the characters. Later on, the story gets even more darker without resorting to plain bloodshed - in a psychological way. Kirito is not overpowered in this arc. He only has the knowledge of a swordsman and works his way from the bottom up.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is well thought out and is planned beforehand. There are several questions that arise in the early episodes - the answers are made clear slowly, as the plot progresses. Some of the things happened may seem irrelevant and random, but they make sense eventually.\\n\\n\r\nA large number of new characters are introduced in this season. Most of them influence main characters in various ways. The three main characters undergo some changes throughout the series and get some good character development. But the same cannot be said about the side characters.These characters last only for about 3 episodes and don't make an appearence till the 2nd part of this arc, but the gap is too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe review will be incomplete if the villain is not mentioned. It is an ambitious character capable of easily manipulating others for personal gain that ended up turning into a different and dangerous entity due to an accident. Certainly there are better villains in the anime history, but this character is arguably the best villain SAO has seen so far. There is a moral ambiguity for this character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of criticisms that can be offered as well. Some episodes have a lot of talking involved. A lot of exposition is delivered this way. People expecting all out action scenes will be disappointed or bored by these episodes. There is some pseudo-science explanation for the premise. It may not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe tower climbing arc is adapted very poorly. The Integrity knights that are supposed to have their own reasons and understandings about the world around them are dumbed down to mere villains of the week. The cliffhangers are conceived in a very poor way. They feel forced and unnecessary because most of the fights are very short.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime looks gorgeous with colorful shading - just like Ufotable. But the same can't be said about action sequences. In many action sequences, the frame of animation focuses only on one character. It makes the viewer unable to follow the fights well. The short fights are usually already ended by the time we get invested into them. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is underwhelming compared to the last seasons. Old music is repeatedly used by remixing it. Only few soundtracks are memorable and they don't last long. Some of them sound very similar to Yuki Kajiura's other works. Only new notable music is the Eugeo's theme and the Quinella's theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation of the source material is below average. It is not butchered to Tokyo Ghoul Re's extent, but it is significantly rushed and cuts out a good amount of inner monologues that gives a good understanding of character relations and motivations. Think of the GGO arc that lasted for 14 episodes but now compress it into 8 episodes. That is how much rushed it actually is. Even so, everything that has happened can still be understood with some thought.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr - If you liked the previous seasons, it is a must watch.\\n\r\nIf you thought that the previous seasons were wasted potential then this is still worth watching as it explores a different theme - in far more detail.\\n\r\nHowever if you didn't like the original characters of SAO, then better stay away from this season. Chances are that you will not like this season either.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still two more cours to come. But that is a different entry in the database. Be informed that the story doesn't end yet.\\n\r\nFor me, what is great about this arc are its themes and execution, albeit the poor adaptation.",

            "content": "Before we begin, be sure to check out Ordinal Scale, a movie of the franchise that\u2019s events take place prior to the main story here. So here we are, back again with another installment (the 3rd) of Sword Art Online that follows the adventures in the virtual reality world of prestigious gamer, Kirito. If you\u2019ve gotten this far with into the franchise, you either loved the excellent blend of its infamous time-jumping storytelling and iconic big fights from the past or hoping for a season that lives up to its promise with a better-paced story and less formulaic plotting. Alicization is the best of both,and while it occasionally falls back to its tropes of old, it still manages to weave a compelling story regardless of its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nLike it\u2019s previous seasons, Alicization plays out in two timelines\u2014one inside the game and the other in the real world. This time around, Gun Gale Online and Aifheim are included, as the production team at A-1 Pictures are tying the past seasons together to form a more cohesive narrative. The first cour has consistent pacing and a great deal of characterization. The second cour raises the stakes, the battles become a lot more grandiose, some instances of revisiting some old tropes which is unfortunate. But an issue with both is the dedicated episodes of heavy exposition to explain the world in which Kirito now finds himself in. While informal, it gets a bit tedious, especially in parts where Asuna and the Cardinal are given ample screen time. But in retrospect, it is needed as the previous seasons sprinted to the finish line without taking the time to properly build up its world, which is something Alicization does right. \\n\\n\r\nThe techno-logic of Sword Art Online has been both impressive and questionable, raising many eyebrows at times. But the logic behind the new tech, \u201cSoul Translator\u201d, is interesting\u2014as it renders the virtual world via memories, instead of polygons, this virtual world is practically indistinguishable from the real world, as every object within the virtual world is at the same level as the real thing in the user's consciousness. The artificial intelligence that is developed for Project Alicization is based on the structure of a human's brain, in order to create an artificial intelligence with awareness and the adaptability level of a human. The rest of the concept that follows is fascinating\u2014the idea that artificial intelligence can be built from the bottom up\u2014can be born, grow, learn and develop with its own unique experiences to guide it. And this is what makes this specific virtual reality world that Kirito is now in, with the addition of newer characters in Eugeo and Alice, all the more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nIn the Underworld (name of the virtual reality world), time passes by a lot quicker than it does in the real world, we get to see Kirito and Eugeo grow up together over the course of a few years. We get a sense of the world through their eyes as well as their interactions within it. Here, Kirito (well sort of) starts off with a blank slate, somethings such as skills from previous games haven\u2019t transferred over, he also can\u2019t log out and some of his memory is distorted. So, the tense feelings that existed in Aincard seep through to Alicization. This also allowed Kirito to take on a different role as more of a mentor to Eugeo, who shares the limelight. This is an interesting dynamic as not only has Kirito taken a step back as the main hero, but we get another male character who can carry the story, overcome the obstacles and challenges in their mission to locate and save Alice, and also be a capable chick-magnet himself. There is a bromance between them, the chemistry they have is to the likes of Batman and Robin, just that the 'Robin' here is a lot more prominent.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization does well to add in some surprises and twists along the way, especially around the whereabouts of Alice, the Integrity Knights, and the presence of the Cardinal and the Administrator. This bright flame of promise at the start of the season starts to flicker from time to time, mainly from the sometimes-excessive expositions and instances of Deus ex Machina but starts to burn brightly as the story reaches its climax stages. The interesting part of Alicization is the questions the series is posing in regards to ethics, morality and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s territory the show has dived into a bit before but never deeply as in this season when the inhabitants of the Underworld are beholden to a \u201cTaboo Index\" of laws that aren\u2019t actually moral in and of themselves. Which brings me to the #MeToo scene that happens in episode 10. For starters, there is a warning of strong and explicit content before the episode starts. Although I understand the reasoning behind the decision to include such a thing, to show the immorality of the Taboo Index but it could have done without. Admittedly, even though it\u2019s a serious issue but I pissed myself laughing how ridiculous one of the nobles looked when he was flying on to the bed.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Alicization is one of the best-looking anime of the season, and Sword Art Online has that reputation in general so it\u2019s to be expected every time from A-1 Pictures when they are working with this series, Sword Art Online continues to set the benchmark for quality and beauty unrivaled in the genre. The artwork is gorgeous, background arts are vigor and vibrant, brimming with tiny animated details, great use of graphical effects or the masterful use of colors combine to provide a visual spectacle of wonder and delight. Character models are detailed and still hold that trademark look. The animation is solid, it makes the choreography of action sequences very crisp and smooth, and they have incorporated new and old camera techniques and special effects to not only maintain but enhanced the quality of the visual spectacle of the battles. A-1 Pictures still uses some of the classic soundtracks as well as newer ones that are really epic. LiSA\u2019s OP and ED themes once again capturing the feeling of the anime perfectly, and the voice acting maintains its quality from the prequels. \\n\\n\r\nAlicization is Sword Art Online\u2019s biggest and most ambitious story arc with a lot more mystery, suspense, and darker themes. If you loved the first two seasons then you\u2019ll likely enjoy this continuation of Kirito\u2019s virtual adventures. The entire show is amazingly detailed with a real eye for color and fluid animation. The idea of having all three seasons being tied together is a nice touch and the characterization along with the new virtual world is generally intriguing and well designed. The time jumps are not much of an issue this time around but they do make their way back and in doing so, offset the pacing momentarily. Alicization is definitely one of the better installments of the franchise to date. It was unable to completely shake off the issues that held it back in previous seasons but was still enjoyable with a lot of more interesting concepts. Looking forward to 3rd and 4th cours, and more of Alice.\\n",

            "content": "For those of you who are unaware, SAO is the ISEKAI that brought the genre to immense popularity. While respecting that it is some what of a pioneer, the story tends to drag on unnecessarily and almost constantly views it's audience as unintelligent by walking everyone by the hand through plot points rather than allowing us to infer what is happening through context. It's SAO, so not watching doesn't make sense, but keeping it as a lower priority view  for this season is recommended. \r\nWhile the art is enjoyable and clean, they've left out other potentially visceral aspects. The story and characters are nothingnew, though aren't they expected to be, and the sound is underwhelming. Not pair the vivid enough visuals with similarly heavy sounds seems like some sort of crime. Episodes keep leaving potential on the table to the point that they cause annoyance. I can see more enthusiastic fans of the genre being irritated during viewing. Passive viewing is simply the most probable way to watch this series, which isn't that surprise, but is a little disappointing.",

            "content": "Overpowered characters.\r\nFrom invincible action heroes to divinely powered chosen ones, \r\nfrom arbitrary powerup masters to \"willpower over logic\" crusaders,\r\nfrom technobabble technicians to omniscient pseudo-strategists, \r\nfrom plot-powered self-inserts to absurdly popular harem leads.\r\nPerfect in every conceivable way... except in terms of actually being well-written or compelling. And therein lies the problem with so many of them. Being overpowered is one thing, but they suffer from something far worse: being boring. They simply come across as bland and generic.\r\nAnd I am not referring to the fact that they crush their opponents with ease. What I am saying is that their personality, motivations and dialogue tend to bedull. It is not just about the characters themselves though. It is rather that the way the narratives are written, these characters are not challenged to question their values or develop their wit in any significant way. They are not allowed to truly think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut don't just take my word for it. Let's hear it from the man himself:\\n\\n\r\n\"A human being's greatest power is to think. It's more powerful than any great sword or secret move.\"\\n\r\n\u2012 Kirigaya Kazuto\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? Kirito is right. This is precisely the main problem here. In Sword Art Online, the narrative too often focuses on swords and secret moves (read: plot-based powerups) over actual thought.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he must have first-hand experience. After all, Kirito is the patron saint of overpowered characters, and you probably know why. He is the best swordsman in the land by a wide margin. He obtains arbitrary powerups whenever the plot demands it. He has saved the day from random villains. He has won the affection of many girls for poorly established reasons. He knows random technical details that nobody else seems to. He might not be the absolute worst offender on the anime scene, but he is perhaps the most notorious, due to the runaway popularity of the franchise. \\n\\n\r\nBut the true measure of a character is not his list of combat achievements but his personality, wit, moral struggle, perhaps even ideology.\\n\\n\r\nKirito tends to selflessly save the day and help everyone. His antagonists are either comically evil or their motives are vague, incomprehensible, or otherwise poorly established. This is done so that we never have to question Kirito's moral superiority. He is the good guy, the hero, the shining knight. To enforce this, everybody seems to like him to an implausible degree, except for the aforementioned comically evil antagonists. Consider what this does to the narrative. Because most of Kirito's friends and associates adore him, there is little meaningful conflict between them, and meaningful conflict is at the heart of good narratives.\\n\\n\r\nAnd note that we are supposed to take all of this unironically. We are supposed to relate to a nigh-perfect protagonist who never has to struggle with any moral dilemmas of any kind because he is always placed in a position in which the antagonists are over-the-top evil or their motives are incomprehensible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the emphasis is on \"placed.\" We don't usually get to see different sides of Kirito \u2012 aside from his role as a heroic savior \u2012 precisely because he is always placed in situations in which he is inclined to become a heroic savior. As I mentioned, he is facing sub-par villains, and he is also provided with the convenient opportunity to defeat them. This is precisely why he comes across as bland. At least, he has so far in the franchise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what does Alicization do to change this? Maybe a little. The premise is a little less black-and-white than some of the previous iterations and presents some moral ambiguity, but it is still fairly clear which of the characters are intended as antagonistic. The narrative also reverts to old patterns in this respect sometimes. I'll get back to this later.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also another notable issue. It seems as though the author sat down and figured, \"Hmm, you know what this show needs? More exposition infodumps.\"\\n\\n\r\n...which the show was never lacking in the first place and which does nothing to resolve the actual problems with the franchise. \\n\\n\\n\r\n1) First, it is time for the glorious infodumps. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, this show comes with encyclopedic lists of technical details. So have fun with rants about Fluctlights, Stacia Windows, the Gigas Cedar, the High-Norkian Style, and the Light Quantum Gate Crystal. There is no shortage of these infodumps, and soon enough you notice that another episode is gone just like that.\\n\\n\r\nAs an example, here is a quote from Kirito himself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Where do you think the human soul is located? [...] The brain is more or less a clump of brain cells, right? So where among the brain cells does the soul exist? All cells, including brain cells, are supported by a structural network. Apparently, they're called microtubules. Tubes. In other words, hollow pipes. And there's something sealed inside those hollow pipes. [...] Light. Light. A fluctuating light photon. And that's what comprises the human soul, according to Rath.\"\\n\\n\r\n...What?\\n\\n\r\nIs that how it works? Given the context of the story, I am going to be generous and assume that \"soul\" is a metaphor for memories, personality and other mental qualities that comprise a human being. This may be giving the author too much credit. Perhaps he really is referring to souls in a literal sense. Who knows? \\n\\n\r\nKirito calls these lights Fluctlights. The thing is, they don't seem to contribute anything substantial that would not already be conveyed by memories or other mental qualities. Every reference to Fluctlights could be replaced by words like \"memory\" or \"mind.\"\\n\\n\r\ne.g. \"Artificial Fluctlight\" -> \"Artificial intelligence\"\\n\\n\r\nIt would get the relevant meaning across even without the imaginary technology. If your dialogue begins to sound like like an engineering booklet when a simple existing description would have sufficed, you are doing it wrong. \\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, it seems that one of the main points the show is getting at is the fact that people are who they are because of their memories. A fair point but one that has already been overused in speculative fiction. If you want to take that route, you need to beef up your analysis and related dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. I can enjoy world-building, but you should not flood the viewer with arbitrary facts for the sake of itself. The details of the world should be constructed so that they support the underlying themes of the narrative. The world-building should actually pay off. For instance, do we need to spend several minutes on the origins of a legendary blade when it has nothing of substance to contribute? In comparison, when the show explains basic facts about their society, the information is actually quite a bit more helpful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat is not the worst of it though. It is not only about the sheer quantity of the exposition but the way in which it is told. There is a right way and a wrong way to provide this information. You should do it naturally, in a manner that actual people might use. \\n\\n\r\nListen to this dialogue.\\n\\n\r\n\"Who would've thought that after [insert event here], we'd actually [insert event here]? Sometimes I think I'm dreaming.\"\\n\r\n\"Come on now. It's already been a year since [insert event here].\"\\n\\n\r\nHow convenient. The characters are recapping the events out loud just when the audience needs the info. They go on for a while, listing various facts about their new pastimes and acquaintances. It is all screaming \"This is exposition!\"\\n\\n\r\nKirito comes across as a kind of Mr. Exposition sometimes, now more than ever. He is all about providing lists of random facts. He lists descriptions of things to the viewer without thinking deeply into their implications. And, incidentally, the other characters do very much the same, often even more so. Just listing facts all day, every day.\\n\\n\r\nAll those lines could have been spent on other things. They could undergo some inner struggle every now and then. There might even be interesting moral conflict. Or how about examining their relationships with other people? But nope. While those other aspects receive some attention, they are usually pushed to the side in favor of further infodumps. Character interaction is really bogged down by this. If you have people acting as though they are reading straight out of an encyclopedia, they become difficult to relate to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter backstories are sometimes treated in the same way. On one occasion, an important character is introduced by delivering an 8-minute flashback infodump on their backstory before ever meeting them. They have never even been mentioned before. You can probably see the problem here. Can't we at least wait until the character has been introduced normally?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the 8-minute flashback in question is narrated by another person throughout. Why? As I was saying, the flashback should wait, but if we must go forward with it, at least show it from the perspective of the relevant character. Show, don't tell.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) Furthermore, too much time and effort is spent on fight scenes that \u2012 while visually fine \u2012 contribute little to the narrative and are resolved in a fairly arbitrary manner. \\n\\n\r\nWhen this is taking place, the dialogue also becomes very centered on explaining the flow of the battle and little else. One episode was almost entirely about swords. Swords clashing repeatedly with simple choreography (mostly people pushing their swords against each other), with the majority of the dialogue focused on swords, swordsmanship and all things related to the weapons in question. This is related to section 1) because much of this is yet another subset of unnecessary technobabble and infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you are a diehard sword fan, this may be acceptable. (Or not if you don't like their portrayal of swordsmanship, and I can't really blame you.) But what if you are not into swords that much? I mean, the technical details. You'll have to sit through endless infodumping on the subject. Sure, the word \"sword\" is right there in the name of the franchise, but come on now. Twenty minutes of non-stop ranting about swords is a bit too much. You know, even fight scenes could be used for character development, moral struggle, etc., but that would take a different approach to dialogue and inner thoughts. Or at least try to be wittier about it. Don't just list the sword techniques in a bland manner.\\n\\n\r\nSo what determines the winner of a sword fight? Finely tuned tactics? No, of course not. In this world, the best way to power up your sword is... strength of will. Yes. You can pretty much beat anyone if you infuse your sword with your imagination, emotion and various reasons to fight. Along with it, various names of sword styles will be mentioned, but they do not seem to affect the outcome in any consistent way, nor are they used tactically in any way that would generate interest. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the battles easily devolve into showdowns of plot power. The winner is the one favored by the narrative. This is far from rare in shows that involve action scenes or various powerups, so this should not come as a surprise, but that does not mean that we should let it slide.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3) And now for another fan favorite: over-the-top evil villains.\\n\\n\r\nHere's another quote from Kirito:\\n\\n\r\n\"That attitude your father taught you, Tiese, in Eng... no, in sacred terms, it's called 'noble obligation.' Nobles, that is, those with power must use it for the sake of the powerless. Let's see, you could also call it pride. And that pride is more important than any law or regulation. After all, there are things that you shouldn't do, even if it's not forbidden by law. And on the other hand, there might be things you should do, even if they are forbidden by law.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit better than what we would usually expect of Sword Art Online. It is also relevant to the premise and underlying themes. You see, this time the author has come up with an eerie medieval rural dystopia ruled by a dogmatic church. If this sounds familiar, you may have seen one in any number of JRPGs or fantasy in general. Which isn't necessarily a bad idea if done right. \\n\\n\r\nYou could use this line of thought to demonstrate why dystopian dogmatic churches are, well, dystopian and dogmatic. There is also some shady manuevering going on in the real world. Maybe it could be applied to that.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least in theory. Guess what kind of evil action Kirito is referring to? As is tradition in Sword Art Online, the evil action is... sexually harassing a girl.\\n\\n\r\nYes. You heard it right. Out of all possible evil deeds out there, the author went with sexually harassing a girl. Again. Or rather beyond mere harassment and in an absurdly over-the-top way as well. If this sounds familiar, you must have been watching Sword Art Online because this keeps happening like clockwork. When the author wants to designate a character as evil or antagonistic, this is his go-to trope. The villains tend to commit sexual harassment or attempted rape, as if they wouldn't be evil enough otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nThe author does this because he doesn't want the audience to have the slightest doubt over who is good and who evil here. So the villains just have to go for the same old sexual harassment or attempted rape. It would not have to be this way. There are other morally questionable things in the world, but nope. Can't write about those. Is the author legally obligated to write about sexual harassment and attempted rape, or does he not know that other topics exist?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what is Alicization supposed to be?\\n\\n\r\nA straight-up heroic fantasy?\\n\r\nA technobabble infodump? \\n\r\n\"We are who we are because of our memories.\"\\n\\n\r\n...Is that really all? This is not enough. Instead of original or inspired, Alicization comes across as bland. Yes, there is a fantasy world out there, arguably fleshed out by the infodumps, but that isn't enough. You also need to do something interesting with the world. The narrative needs more substance.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I quoted Kirito earlier on the superiority of thought over swords? He said so in the context of applying critical thought to law and morality. Fine. So give him a proper chance to think about it in detail and apply it in an interesting way. Instead, he (and sadly us, the viewers) are subjected to endless lists of arbitrary facts that are meaningless on their own. Or we get to witness action scenes which are resolved by plot power or used as platforms for even more infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the talk about human souls, it is precisely what the narrative is lacking. Where is the humanity?",

            "content": "[Spoilers]\r\nCovers as much ground as it can, but doesn't go in depth with anything it introduces. Lots of pointless content and irrelevant characters. Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Wine is often being drank when these conversations are had. Various things being shown from multiple different perspectives, or rather; realities. Hardly any plot advancement because showing a million different things is prioritized above all else. Good moments are scarce and typically enjoyable only because they suck so bad, but in most cases, the thing is just idiotic in a highly boring way and that's the end of this story. No, I didn't accidentally post my 'Legend of theGalactic Heroes' review under wrong entry, but am actually talking about Sword Art Online: Alicization. Show which I was supposed to watch ironically and laugh whenever anything happens, but the problem is that so often nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\n[Setup - Basically sums up episode 1]\\n\\n\r\nThe story start off with wood chopping and sandwich making scenes. Fair enough, Kirito trains and the newest harem addition shows how she contains many essential \"ideal female\" characteristics, such as being able to make sandwiches and knowing how to read because she is smart. Well, I didn't laugh there, but the mary sue factors seemed quite potentially lol-worthy, and that was just the beginning so whatever, I watched more.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, these three kids (they are kids now and there is 3 of them, and I still don't know who the third is, 2nd: Alice) go in this cave where some dragon used to dwell and they steal some ice from him Iunno what the fuck is happening, but they get lost and eventually end up in this place called dalukuu dellidoly (dark territory in English), and apparently crossing the border there is not simply illegal but super illegal. Just so happens to be this Alice girl is also showing how she is bit of a klutz -- which is another ideal female characteristics if someone doesn't know -- and falls down so her 3 finger tips cross the border and gets sentenced to death/is kidnapped. Lucky for them the 3rd kid awakens his Sharingan this very moment and not all hope is lost.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this we teleport back into season 2 of Sword Art Online (I guess) because Kirito is now an adult female or a man with ridiculously long hair in this one and there are lolies with guns and evil people wearing masks all around. This part was pretty fun because Kirito and his/hers buddies use light sabers and there is another dude here who has sharingan, I wonder who on earth he might be and how these things are relevant. This is me trying to connect the dots and at the same time my facial expression when watching it ._.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I had almost dropped the series. I was like \"holy shit, I swear this episode is at least 50 minutes long and never ends.\" but then I noticed it is actually a double episode and literally 50 minutes long. That didn't really help, tho, since I was only 20 minutes in.. but I wasn't technically wrong, so I continued.\\n\\n\r\n15 minutes later I came back to reality and realized I had been watching a scene where Kirito and harem have this really important conversation about some LED lights placed in the human soul or something, and lots of smart science stuff about some nerdy shit / someone trying to explain something regarding another thing, but it was basically about time functioning differently inside virtual reality, mind teleportation and finally confirmed this whole thing was actually inspired by Alice in Wonderland, which I had accidentally taken as a meme for years.... Neat. \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least this was followed with some cringe-ass confession scene which was concluded with a terribly animated kiss just to remind viewers that lots of deep love to be found here, after which some random dude attacks Kirito who then wakes up in the alternative kids world which seen in the beginning and is like \"oh yeah, this is the nerdy science shit virtual WORLD I just had a 15 minute dialogue about.\" How convenient, chaotically random and still didn't make me laugh because too boring, and more like offensively bad than lol-worthy. At least his body in real world paralyzed or something which is kinda cool and also happened in season 1, technically.. boy I wonder if he can ever turn back normal..\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\\n\r\nWe have NPC's - just like in many/any other video games, and just like in many cyberpunk series: they are becoming self-aware, influenced by feelings and questioning their purpose in life. The vanity, the thought-provoking content and emotional depth create us a narrative that is about as fun to watch as it is intelligent. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, the entire main plotline in this alternative world is practically incredibly slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks with episodic cliffhangers instead of trying to master or advance anything it already has going on. Pretty much half of the damn thing is slice of life or sol-like filler that serves no real purpose in the series, other than to make it more lengthy. And so far, the main plotline in the real world is basically also a slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks..... Well, I guess point delivered: some similarities exist among the plots. Great. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of directing or whatever we want to call it, scenes change with so little continuity and start playing out so randomly that it becomes highly noticeable: it stands out. This thing hasn't been build on very solid basis or structured in a passable manner. This level of story telling and directing would not be praised were this a new franchise. For example, even though the main storyline seems to be going nowhere, the series still has lots of content and is overall rather creating the illusion of fast pace and eventful story while really nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite part of the writing so far has been Alice's astral projection just teleporting inside Kirito's brain because I am not sure if that was actually foreshadowing regarding the nerdy technology shite or just her being used as a plot device to allow the story advance. By allowing it to advance, I don't mean it actually advanced because things like chopping trees are prioritized over such things. This is the part that offered at least some lulz.  The melodrama is also incredible because after Kirito was attacked he became some type of vegetable in the real world and lots of girls are real worried and crying. Such pathetic, try-hard shit-writing it's hard not to laugh when the thing is essentially worse written than average fanfiction. I just wish this was the main side of the story. Maybe later episodes will turn this thing into some sort of Sword Art Online 0, a story about depressed Asuna. #not_a_reference I dream. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\n'The Devil is a Part-Timer', anime from 2013, anyone? So this time around Kirito has a nice little side job, making Jesus a Part-Timer, too. Hah! Kirito is being Kirito here. The difference being that this time around he is not the most flawless being from day one, which is kinda cool I guess, especially when considering how the training side of this thing has been among the strongest parts of the series thus far. Still sucks, tho.\\n\\n\r\nHis name is Eugeo! The third kid I mean. His role in the series is pretty much solely to tell Kirito some lore, fill him with information regarding the world and say out loud how impossible and things are and how amazing Kirito can be. Occasionally he also does some incredibly stupid decisions and fucks everything uppa. I am not going to spoil how badly, but I did laugh there. \\n\\n\r\nAlice's sister is pretty cute so I guess that's something + that carrying scene [by Kirito, naturally] was flawless in every way. She is especially good when considering most grills from this franchise were never even worth that much. Too bad she ain't a main character. As a whole, the cast surely isn't among reasons to follow this masterpiece, but it's still kinda worth it for the papa swag factor and council of neko-eared harem girls disgusting about issues. It's truly fascinating to see how 5 fanservice figures and Kirito's \"daughter\" have meetings and make plans. \"We totally matter and can do things.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe more episodes there are, the more characters whose names I didn't even bother memorizing there are. That kind of amazing stuff going on here. I don't find mentioning anything about them to be worth of anyone's time, so I won't. Originally I planned also to write a section about the dialogue, but then I remembered I already said in the opening paragraph all that needs to be said about it. [Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue]. It also does amazing job making me not to like any characters because it is just that nauseating. \\n\\n\r\n[Production]\\n\\n\r\nNot the worst A-1 character design, but those CGI goblins are on another shitness level completely. The animation can be pretty rough and far from fluid. Cheap stuff, but also making me more confident that hiatus/split cours won't occur. The character movements are often awkward as well and again, CGI exists. From its color pallet and backdrops the thing also looks like other SAO series. The voice acting is meeting the same standards with earlier seasons as well. In terms of songs, big names in the making of OP and ED, as usual. BGM-wise, not much of it is present. Dialogue is the main thing that is being heard hear [fuck me, I know], occasionally some uber quiet \"menu music\" plays at the same time, or alternative terrible emotional song that convey feelings similarly as fart jokes deliver luls. Some based wobsie wob songs are present during action, but they surely could be better -- like everything else in the series... \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\\n\r\nI am glad I didn't choose a career as a timberman. I am not entirely sure why I am still watching this. I rarely drop anime series these days, but this one is definitely getting closer and closer of getting onto that list.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online franchise presents a new entry with its Alicization ark and doubles down on familiar writing disasters. With this season SAO reaches new storytelling lows and also seems to lose its last redeeming quality \u2013 action scenes. \r\nSCORE: 2 \u2013 Very Bad. \r\nSTORY: Boring exposition scenes interrupted by obligatory and meaningless fights. \r\nAt the beginning I was slightly confused, because SAO:A does not directly follow on its second season. This confusion lasted only a few episodes and worked as a setup for a new \u201cdeath simulation\u201d for Kirito, without his harem, but with the same amount of plot armor and OPnes. \r\nTerrible writingis more apparent in this season than anywhere else in the franchise. This show is too busy creating lengthy exposition dumps about either mundane or unnecessary topics: several episodes long discussion about calling and its meanings, that loses relevance after 1 sword swing; an entire episode to establish something as simple as basic royalty system; or 15 minutes of backstory for 2 characters, who lose within 10 seconds and vanish, just to name a few. As a result, plot progresses at a snail pace.\\n\r\nNot that the actual plot is any good. A lot of techno gibberish, plot holes and questionable motivations. Just a simple \u201csave the girl\u201d premise buried under a convoluted mess of pointless subplots. \\n\r\nAt least, people will stop talking about Asuna\u2019s horrible treatment in the first season, as SAO:A manages to top that scene. Genius. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Kirito - doubled; harem - disabled. \\n\r\nThere is Kirito and then there is lesser Kirito, who is just a slightly inferior version of the original. Support cast consists of crazy dudes and girls, predetermined assault victims or characters who die for nothing. There is really not much to talk about here. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: One step forwards, two steps backwards. \\n\r\nWhile character models and backgrounds show more craftsmanship than the average anime show, SAO:A seems sterile und unimaginative, be it detailed but boring backgrounds or character designs. \\n\r\nThe biggest downgrade happened to action scenes. Sword fights turned into arm wrestling competition, where combatants just press glowing sticks against each other. Gone are the days of fluid sword dancing. Even the most potent fight against goblins in ep4 borrows too much from infamous directorial techniques like unnecessary camera movement or excessive close-ups, executed at 10 cuts per second. I certainly could not enjoy presented action.  \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The most anime sound possible. \\n\r\nThis is a MVP production, as Minimal Viable Product. Neither the music, nor the voice act stand out and will leave any memory. Maybe with the exception of this distorted sound on high energy impacts during fights.   \\n\\n\r\nDo not waste your time on this garbage. If you are looking for a competent \u201ctrapped in a video game world\u201d anime with a clear goal, superb world building, diplomacy, smart use of game mechanics and successful focus on NPCs, try Log Horizon.\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS. I advise any fans of this series to take this review with a grain of salt. I am here to criticize, and nothing more. Do not take this as an insult if you liked it. These are my opinions and my analysis of the series, nothing more.\r\nNow that we have that out of the way, let me make myself clear on my stance on this series, (if not already apparent by my score): This part of the anime is no different than the ones that preceded it. It has good art, but after that, I find it a complete travesty on thenarrative and cinematic level. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, all things considered, is done very well, as expected of A-1 pictures. It is very vibrant, and the blood has a very nice tint to it. However, the same cannot be said for other visual aspects of this show. The character designs were alright, but Eugeo just look like an almost inverted color palette Kirito, and Alice looked like she was wearing rip-off Gilgamesh armor from the Fate series. Most of the other character designs were ok, but nothing special. The only thing I really liked character-design-wise was the Integrity knight armor, all of which looked pretty cool. The next part of criticism is leveled at the camera angles, which as part of a cinematic approach to the series, were horrendous. For all the confusing, boring, and downright lame dialogue this series rains on you, there is nothing to balance it. This series uses the pan shot to death, and it really left me yawning at everything I had to sit through. Literal 10+ minutes of boring dialogue trying to explain the mess of a narrative the plot was. This moves me onto my next point: the plot.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nThis has got to be one of the biggest ass-pulls I have ever witnessed in the medium. I will jump around because describing the plot in its entirety is pointless. To start off, let me just say that this is like the original SAO's plot, but far worse, even with a time skip to boot. So it really begins when Kirito is attacked by one of the people involved in the Death Gun murders from before and needs to go to a hospital, but for some reason is transferred to MILITARY-RUN ORGANIZATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA TO PLAY ANOTHER VIDEO GAME. He is transported to yet another MMORPG, and then is introduced to the other mains, and basically told he is going to rescue one of them that was taken away for some stupid reason. After that, I lost all hope of a cohesive and consistent story. Some of the more important parts of the story were just stupid. For instance, one time, Kirito is sent to jail. In the same episode, he escapes; even though he is literally in the most secure building in the area. At the end, while fighting the generically-bad-for-no-reason-overpowered-villain (who is also a woman in this game I might add), she is naked for 3 episodes. You couldn't even make the argument that she was \"asserting her dominance\", because if she were all-powerful, she could have just generated clothes for herself. It was actual tasteless fan service because she had to ability to do pretty much anything with the bounds of her power. The last thing I have to say is that the exposition dumps in this show were far worse than the last instances. I think it was about (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) 4-5 times. Anyway, the plot is all over the place, and also has a HARD over-reliance on the \"forgotten childhood friend\" trope that we all love so much. If you want to find out for yourself how bad the plot is, I implore you to go watch this trash.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nScore: 3\\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nNow most of you would be like \"This is just a ploy to lower your score, isn't it?', and to that end, I would say this: WHY IS THE OST FROM THE LAST TWO STILL BEING USED???\\n\r\nSeriously, get a new composer or something, because the BGM in this show is tired as fuck. Aside from that, the first of OP just sounds like Crossing Field, but more boring. The other OP and EDs are slightly above average, but nothing irreplaceable to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 20%\\n\\n\r\nWhat more needs to be said here? The characters are just as horrible as ever (I'm only doing mains bc side characters are treated like shit). Let me start off with the biggest problem (as usual): Kirito. I feel like the writer has stretched this character out to the far ends of the galaxy. No, seriously, he has so many character traits, IT\u2019S UNCOUNTABLE. Kirito is flawless, and that's why I don't like him as a character. He has his cake, and devours it as well. He has a harem of girls, has stupid luck, can beat anyone at anything, and somehow manages to be a \"tragic\", \"flawed\", and \"understanding\" character. He never really suffers any consequence for HIS actions, just of those around him. It is because of this that he will never see proper character development. Anyway, as much as I'd LOVE to go on about how bad he is, plenty of people have already heard it, so I'll move on to Eugeo and Alice. As I stated earlier, this series has a over-reliance on the \"forgotten childhood friend\", and this time the plot decided to tie Kirito to these two in that way, even though he had literally never known them outside of the game. Eugo is a shy and humble boy, who soon joins with Kirito after the plot kicks in. After that, Eugeo doesn't really do much to drive the overall plot forward, and is just there to constantly remind Kirito what their goal is. Alice is the other character which Eugo aims to save along with Kirito. Within the bounds of the god-awful plot, when she conveniently loses her memory to become a bad-ass Integrity knight. I wish at least the second part were true, but she accomplished nothing, and ended up heavily relying on Kirito instead. There is also a sub-plot in which she wanted to get her memories back, but she never did due to how shallow the plot structure was. Speaking of shallow, how about we move onto another discount DIO Brando? The Pontifex is probably just as bad as Kirito because she is just a complete asshole. She is literally just discount DIO, but minus the immense and memorable flare DIO had. Anyway, the side characters (as also mentioned before) were all but forgotten about, and hardly influenced the main's action. The most any side character contributed was when two of them were being (you guessed it): RAPED.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 35%\\n\\n\r\nI felt massive disdain after completing this, because of the fuck-all way it was ended. A stupid cliff-hanger no doubt. Anyway, In my opinion, all of this was way too fucking long. This could have been done in 12 episodes. In essence, it just felt cheap.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7*.15) + (1*.15) + (3*.15) + ( 1*.20) + (1*.35) = 2.2\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to complain about my criticisms, I ask you this: Is it really worth both of our time? Or can you just accept my opinion as it is and move on? Anyway, I might add that this is my first review, so sorry if my writing was shaky. Thank you for reading!",

            "content": "So I decided to torture myself by watching another season of SAO, after being so disappointed that i dropped the second season halfway in (the end of the GGO arc), but I'm glad to say that this season exceeded my expectations.\r\nThe story has improved significantly and has an added element of mystery that is actually compelling. My only complaints being that there is quite a bit of exposition that could be done in a more interesting way and the second one being a bit with the direction that there may be occasions where the imagery may be slightly unrelated to the dialogue and a lotof visual focus may fall on insignificant details, but it's much better than in the previous seasons (that's me nitpicking a bit, but that's usually kinda what separates masterpieces from other works).\\n\r\nThe artwork is great, the artstyle is nice and polished and the occasional use of cgi only adds to the visual effects and it's used smartly to add more tension to fight scenes and overcome the limitations of 2D animation.\\n\r\nAnother thing I'm happy that Kirito's character stopped being the center of the universe and has stepped back a bit (SPOILER ALERT) has taken a bit the role of a mentor and a guiding figure(END OF SPOILER). Overall his character has much more dimension showing that the writing has improved. THE KIRITO FANCLUB has finally more personality beyond just \"OH MY GOD KIRITO IS SO COOL!!!1!\" and it's established in just a few scenes.\\n\r\nAlso praise whoever decided to tone down the fanservice to just 1 second of an awkward position in 1 episode out of 4.\\n\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying it and i really hope it doesn't go downhill from here, cause it's going in a good direction",

            "content": "As someone who is coming in attached to Sword Art Online because of the Aincrad Arc, who was let down by the Fairy Tale Arc, who felt GGO and the rest of SAO II was satisfactory, Alicization has done nothing but exceed my expectations. From the start, the world that was created around Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice was one that had me mesmerized. This was the world building that I saw glimpses of in the Aincrad arc, that I wish I had seen more of. From the details of the cove, to how the town looked, I was instantly drawn to this world. Although itmight have seemed kind of filler to individuals, the second half of the first episode, I can assure you, is integral to much later on in the story. Additionally, I understand that many people had problems with the cut-down time lapse of Kirito and Eugeo making their way to the capital, but honestly, plot-wise, this was easily the best choice for them to cut down budget wise. Additionally, say what you will, I believe that Episode 10 was built up to incredibly well from the previous episodes. The two minor antagonists, were essentially built around the character development of the world itself; they were individuals who used the Taboo Index to their advantage in order to carry out their ill desires, their human desires. I believe that the scene (I won't explain in detail) was extremely graphic, but in a way that was critical to the plot unlike Sugou and the Fairy Tale arc. I believe that the producers did an amazing job in truly building up the suspense and violence in such a scene, and that this scene was critical in furthering the plot development regarding Fluctlight behaviour. I would say that scene was more powerful than anything I've watched previously, and as someone who's seen shows like Goblin Slayer, trust me, this scene is messed up. Nonetheless, I believe it was executed extremely well by the show producers, and I can only look forward to see what's coming in store. Additionally, I believe the art animation, although choppy in some areas, is that fantasy vibe that captures Alicization well. You want the epic sword fights that you signed up for from the Aincrad arc? You'll get plenty of it. You want to hear the best soundtracks from the previous seasons come out remade, with a whole added kick? Done. You want to see Kirito start anew in a world where he isn't totally broken, and has to actually learn how to use the system and develop like a normal protagonist would? It's done. Sick of harem and fanservice? It's cut down immensely in this season. You want actual side characters that are constantly developed and not just shadows in the background? Eugeo, and later Alice are clear cut examples of that. Paying attention to every detail in the show rewards the viewer well, and it'll only continue to do so in the future episodes. I'm excited to see what the best arc of Sword Art Online has to bring, and I believe that this arc has redeemed the series from what has been an abysmal past season. If you liked the Aincrad Arc, and put up with everything after, you'll be rewarded for your loyalty to this series with Alicization. A 52 episode season isn't something that we get often in this day and age, and from the looks of the first 10 episodes, I can't help but get excited for the episodes to come.",

            "content": "As a TL;DR, if you absolutely hate SAO, you're still probably going to hate this. Its improved but still has some of it's issues.\r\nIf you think parts of SAO were good and others (*cough* ALO) were bad, this season is as good or better than the Aincrad arc. \r\nThe story and premise for this season were overall very interesting and helped build an incredibly interesting situation. I have a few issues with the story (mainly the IRL portion), but overall its 8/10, pretty good. As a light novel reader, I understand the anime had to gloss over some things, but overall I think they arekeeping a good balance of plot development and speed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound, and animation are 10/10 as always with A1 Pictures. This anime is beautiful and well made. \\n\\n\r\nNow as to why this particular season is arguably the strongest in SAO. Simply put, it has a lot more content and many characters that even Kirito has to respect. Things are darker, there's blood and gore. There's also many characters that are incredibly influential. As always, characters are rather static but some of them do change and grow; they're important. \\n\\n\r\nThat can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. This arc is based off of roughly 10 light novels as opposed to the usual 2. Not every single episode is filled to the brim with action; there's dialogue and character development.  Rest assured though, there are plenty of epic fights in this show, especially in the upcoming episodes. People will complain that its too fast or too slow, just know that it has a lot to cover and that there are fast and slow parts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, As a LN reader so far I'm loving this season. There's plenty or things to look forward to and what's already there is very well executed. If you absolutely hate SAO this probably won't change your mind, but its a good story with fun to watch fights and a plot that explores what its like to be human; definitely an improvement from previous arcs. I'm slightly biased as this is the only series I can stand reading ahead, but I highly suggest you watch this.",

            "content": "\"Watch Alicization, it's SO much better\"\r\nBecause it is. Because normal people don't cling to their hate of a series and use everything it did wrong in the past as a reason to hate it in the present.\r\nNormal people won't go on about how \"SAO's biggest problem is itself,\" or try their damn hardest to try to prove how Reki fails as a writer because of what he's done in the past. They don't compare every little flaw in Alicization to what SAO was in the past because THIS ISN'T THE PAST. Alicization isn't perfect, it has its flaws, but rating this series a 1, 3,hell even 5? No, Alicization is in almost every possible way lightyears ahead of the past seasons, and even the movie (which I enjoyed significantly more than either other season just fyi)\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers for any of the 3 people reading this who haven't already watched Alicization; of pretty much the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\n\"Boring infodumps\"\\n\r\nPretty much the biggest problem of Alicization as a whole. If it wasn't bad enough in ufotable's adaptation of UBW, Alicization is loaded to the brim with pausing in the middle of battles to make time seemingly stop in order to express dialogue that I can only imagine was a lot better in the original light novels.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest flaw with Alicization, yes. I won't deny that. But here's where I offer pushback as my reason for bringing this up first: THIS WASN'T AN ISSUE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand what the issue is with so many people having problems with how Alicization decided to set the scene. It was a completely new setting in every way; the only relative similarity between it and past seasons of SAO is the fact that it's not a part of the real-world. Though, in a lot of ways, it might as well have been.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't me trying to tout moderate improvement to past seasons either, as something that's a little better than complete crap is still crap... this is more me saying that bad exposition turned into slightly above-average exposition. I had a lot of fun watching how Alicization started off and I got tons of great vibes from both the writer(s) and the general direction of how everything was handled. Kirito isn't just being thrown into this world nonsensically to kickstart a completely new story with the \"Sword Art Online\" branding that stars someone as famous as \"Kirito,\" this is the SAO world in a completely new light.\\n\\n\r\n\"Time skips\"\\n\r\nThis is about one of the most laughable complaints I've ever heard for any anime, hell any piece of media as far as I can remember. People really wanna try to compare the two-year time skip of Aincrad to the two-year time skip of Alicization. Alright, let me explain something very simple that's literally nothing more than basic understanding of the material you're writing about (ironically the people who don't have this probably shouldn't even be writing reviews in the first place) -\\n\\n\r\nAincrad: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, including (but not limited to) the overarching plot and setting, the introduction of cool characters, and the feeling of \"growing pains\" that surrounds all of these things, there was the decision to have an extended time skip pretty much RIGHT to the end. Aincrad's biggest issue is that it skipped past all the cool stuff that everyone would've not only loved to see, but even NEEDED to see to be able to comprehend why everything that happened happened.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, almost all within the same parameters of Aincrad right before its infamous time skip, there was the decision to have an extended time skip right to the \"meat and potatoes\" part of the season. Alicization's biggest strongpoint is that it skipped past all the boring stuff that nobody would've enjoyed seeing, essentially saving everyone a bunch of time by quickly filling in what would've otherwise been a bunch of boring filler. God bless the team behind Alicization for not milking SAO out to be a generic battle shonen with 50+ straight episodes of filler, and instead cutting to the chase and saying \"ok, so this is what we did. And then we trained and grew for 2 years and now we're here. Now let's get to the good stuff.\"\\n\\n\r\nPutting it frankly, Aincrad skipped over the good stuff and Alicization skipped over the bad stuff. Remember, just because something is a horrible writing decision in one scenario doesn't mean it's going to be just as bad in what is literally the EXACT OPPOSITE of the same scenario.\\n\\n\r\n\"It didn't have enough _____\"\\n\r\nTo fill in the blank, the most common terms other reviewers have used have been \"world-building,\" \"definition,\" \"focus,\" and other terms people have thrown around.\\n\\n\r\nTo a certain point I can agree, but to the most basic of points I cannot.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with world-building. Common complaints you'll hear essentially say that \"because Alicization isn't an ACTUAL open-world MMO it fails at world building.\" Except... how many anime have you seen really nail world building to the level that it would be sufficient in an MMO scenario? It just doesn't happen, because anime is a different medium to an actual MMO. Even top-tier world building, like what you'd find in something like FMAB, wouldn't compare to an actual lore-rich MMO.\\n\\n\r\nKirito, Eugeo, and Alice grow up in one town, and the main goal of that town is specifically the tree Eugeo has to cut down. So why exactly does every little village need to be covered? Then they move onto a more upper-class city because they're trying to become nobles. So why does everything need to be covered there? And then they move onto the cathedral, where it's made very clear that they only fight against knights on very specific floors. So why does every floor need to be covered?\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people think that because an anime is based inside of what is otherwise an MMORPG that it needs to have the same caliber of world-building as one. However, this isn't World of Warcraft. This is SAO, an anime series. And personally, I think the quicker that you begin to realize that, the more you'll end up enjoying Alicization as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a 24-episode anime series, so not every single town, camp, NPC, and even table can have the same huge backstory that those respective things would in an actual MMORPG. Of course this isn't me saying the world-building of Alicization is absolutely amazing either, I'm just saying it does its job. Not every anime needs to have world-building as good as FMAB to be sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nNow for definition. I don't have a lot to say about this because I actually agree with people saying Alicization isn't extremely well-defined. Personally, I think it does its job well, but it definitely isn't perfect, hell I'd probably not even say its good; just a bit above average, really.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue Alicization has with its overall definition and polish is the simple fact that it will fall really flat in being overly cohesive as an anime. It tells a lot more than it shows sometimes, which is something I will forever consider a flaw in a visual medium. But as I said, I don't have a ton to say because I don't think it's as good as the fanboys say or as bad as the haters say. It's average, maybe just a bit above it.\\n\\n\r\nBut man, focus. This is where I have a bone to pick with certain individuals.\\n\\n\r\nI will agree fully with the fact that certain things DID deserve more focus than they got, particularly around Eugeo's backstory and the fact that a lot of things went completely ignored. It really does bother me that the issues he (apparently) had with his family went completely ignored, and how he suddenly remembered that it wasn't just him and Alice together as children, but Kirito as well... except, he just conveniently forgot what happened during the 6 years that they weren't together (between when Alice disappeared and when Kirito spawned back into the underworld at his real-world age). I wanna know more about this kind of stuff, and the fact that these things weren't really covered does bother me quite a bit, and definitely worked towards impacting the story in a negative way.\\n\\n\r\nBut, just because the story had a few glaring issues suddenly means that EVERYTHING it did was wrong? No way.\\n\\n\r\nSee, even though I said earlier that Alicization isn't an MMO, there's still the blatant fact that it's definitely ABOUT an MMO. Of course something about an MMO that takes place in an MMO is going to have MMO characteristics, just like how it DID have an overarching world and the world was built around the plot despite not being built to the level you'd expect from a traditional MMO. To say that Alicization lost focus by putting too much attention on \"unimportant matters\" is just foolish.\\n\\n\r\nFluctlights are important. As are sword skills, and how they happen. As is the villain and what they're gonna do, the same way you would talk about taking on a boss in an MMO. Remember, this isn't just purely a simulation/video game, but that it also isn't JUST a battle of humanity challenging a greater evil. It's both.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start rambling, let's wrap up this \"reviewer rant\" section with a few other points before getting into MY review.\\n\\n\r\n1. Alicization intentionally doesn't always take itself seriously. Much like many fans of comedy (both in and out of anime) understand very clearly, even the most serious things can have comedic breaks without seeming out of character. Alicization does the same thing except with both comedy and absurdity. It likes to be fun, and if it doesn't always take itself too seriously, you shouldn't either. Just have fun, you'll enjoy it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\n2. The actual content of the plot is different from past seasons of SAO solely because things have a reason for happening. Nitpicking every little issue from the plot doesn't necessarily take away the real substance of it and what makes it great, which is something I don't see enough reviewers talking about (and it honestly bothers the hell out of me). They talk about the flaws in a way that creates a two-page wall of text, and then end it with \"and this is why it sucks.\" That's only part of it, though; be fair and respectful towards the creators and talk about BOTH parts.\\n\\n\r\n3. I'll go deeper into this later, but I want people to understand that the \"casuals will be casuals\" argument is about the dumbest thing any person can genuinely use against Alicization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for my own words that aren't at all intended to be used directly against anyone else's.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was the main grabber that made me realize that the general story of Alicization was different from past seasons of SAO? If I had to pin down one exact thing, it would be everything that happens happens for a well-defined reason.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't just the time skip, insane plot armor (Jesus-kun), and nonsensical BS that ruined Aincrad (and the entire first and most of the second season as a whole). What it was was that even an outstanding majority of the sections that were complete and coherent had no real reason to be happening.\\n\\n\r\nKirito meets a girl and she dies. Waste of an episode. Three episodes of watching him and the female lead screw around. Waste of three episodes. Cut away to a period of time where they spent 3 episodes getting a sword to make Kirito even more overpowered and then some random girl is sick and we're supposed to care about her. Waste of literally half a season.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization not only improves on this array of crap, but handles it in ways that aren't hard to get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to introducing an interesting character and immediately forgetting about them for the rest of the series, Alicization introduces multiple interesting characters that fully fulfill their role in the series. When something happens, it makes sense why it happens and it's typically very enjoyable. The long-term static growth of these characters often happens off-screen, but the main kicker is the fact that when there's a significant amount of growth in a short amount of time, we see it and are able to understand fully why it's happening, and it always makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe time that's wasted in Alicization isn't wasted with events that make no sense, because everything makes sense and there's always a good reason for it. The issues each character faced were clearly cut out and made sense, and were enjoyable to watch, even if some of them ended up being dumb, mindless fun without much real substance.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the controversial way of handling a topic as sensitive as sexual abuse, there was never a time where it felt overly edgy or at all like fetishizing the subject, instead the themes were mature and the audience was respected throughout the exploration of the subject.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization doesn't do a lot to question the way people think or how you do things; it isn't psychological or philosophical. Instead, you have this action series that handles itself like an action series, staying true to itself throughout the entire thing, start to finish, doing everything in a way that makes sense and is enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf my discussion of the story sounded at all basic, open-ended in a bad way, or generally stretched out without much substance, that's because it was. The story of Alicization was the worst part of it, it was a pretty good story that wasn't great, and most of the reason I liked it came down to personal enjoyment of action anime and the fact that it was coherent enough to get by. As I mentioned earlier, not everything NEEDS to be taken super seriously, and it's a lot easier to enjoy things that aren't perfect (or in this case, great) when you decide to just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that the story of Alicization was bad, though. Just not amazing. Still pretty good. Flawed. Not perfect, but definitely above-average.\\n\\n\r\nBut the characters... this was definitely the biggest improvement to past seasons of SAO.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization completely obliterates every past season of SAO in the character department for 3 main reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1. General character layout\\n\r\n2. Number of characters\\n\r\n3. Purpose of characters\\n\\n\r\nLet's dive deeper.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by \"general character layout\" is the fact that Kirito, beyond the first episode, understands fully well that he's in a virtual world and that none of these people are real. This is a huge deal because of how characters have been handled in past seasons; Kirito understood that all the people in SAO, ALO, and GGO were real, living human beings.\\n\\n\r\nIt's different, but why is it important? Fantastic question. Because it allows Kirito to question the decisions he makes.\\n\r\nAside from how the season ends, the idea that sits in the back of Kirito's brain throughout the entire season is that the world is virtual and nothing huge is lost if he doesn't complete his mission. Despite that, he still draws huge ties to the individuals he meets and fights as hard as he possibly can to ensure that the mission is eventually completed.\\n\r\nI consider this extremely important for one reason: Kirito was once the most basic anime protagonist to ever exist. Now, he has layers and it's a lot easier to relate to him on a personal level, beyond that of a basic \"haha I like video games too Kirito is a cool anime character.\" Hell, there may even be times where you'll forget that this is the same Kirito from the last two seasons; god knows I felt that way a few times.\\n\\n\r\nNumber of characters is a lot more important than many will realize; there really isn't an actual \"wasted\" character here.\\n\r\nIf you learn as little as the name of any character, you'll be quick to understand that they're probably gonna be important to the plot, and 100% of the time that ends up being the case. This contradicts from past seasons of SAO purely because you had characters like Klein, Liz, Silica, Suguha, and Agil that had no actual meaning to the plot... and if you're like me, you understand that that was a MAJORITY of the \"primary\" characters in the first 2 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization takes a different, FAR superior approach, to the characters; everybody means something to the plot, and the ones who don't are just simply left as non-characters who aren't even properly introduced. A lot of ways this is proven are by things like characters being introduced early-on and having an important role later on, characters being or not being introduced by name quickly after their first on-screen appearance, or characters doing something for the plot early on. The amount of organization that comes from something as simple as NOT creating a character unless they have a reason to exist increases the overall quality of the season significantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of characters is quite possibly the most important thing here, but the thing that requires the least explaining just because of how obvious it is and how much better it makes things.\\n\\n\r\nLet me give you a quick example. Sinon was a female lead many considered badass because she wasn't a Mary Sue like Asuna, and actually had some definition and substance whereas Asuna didn't. The problem was, despite Sinon's positive attributes, she still became part of Kirito's harem.\\n\r\nAlice is similar; she's by far the best female lead in SAO history (even if she is basically just a thought until halfway through the season), and has tons of definition even compared to Sinon. But... she doesn't become part of Kirito's harem, instead she remains mostly independent in personality and thought.\\n\\n\r\nThis didn't just apply to Alice, either. Eugeo wasn't Klein; a quick sidekick abandoned after two epiodes. His existence was just as important as Kirito's, something that couldn't be said about any other character in either of the past seasons besides Asuna's in Mother's Rosario.\\n\r\nSelka didn't just sit as lolibait to make people feel like they had their own \"imouto-chan\" to love and cherish, she actually sat as positive progression of Alice's character later on. Complete 180 compared to Suguha.\\n\r\nRonie and Tiese weren't just random waifus to add to Kirito's harem like Silica and Liz, they were essential parts to progressing the story of Kirito and Eugeo, essentially the reason their journey of saving Alice truly began in the first place.\\n\r\nEtc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to ignore how in SO many ways Alicization just takes the parts that made past seasons of SAO complete crap and makes them great. This isn't just polishing a turd, this is completely restructuring the turd and turning it into pure gold. Again, more reviewers need to talk about this kind of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I can brush over quickly, before wrapping everything up: the art and sound of Alicization was near perfection.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you will get the ufotable UBW vibes of \"let's slow down/pause the battle to add in dialogue\" pretty often throughout Alicization, what you'll also get is the artistic fidelity of ufotable UBW, or at least damn close. The art is beautiful; the still scenes are absolutely gorgeous, the environments are a treat to look at, and the quality of the battles are nothing I'd consider any less than majestic. The art and animation of Alicization are not up for debate; they're amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound does the same thing, just to me perhaps a little better. As a die-hard Yuki Kajiura fanboy, it's quite easy for me to enjoy every little detail of the music here, to the point where even tracks that I felt like I'd heard too much in the prior 2 seasons felt really great (and slightly nostalgic) when mixed into Alicization; if anything, they felt a lot more at-home here than in the past. Of course, all of the new music was incredible down to the finest detail as well, including both opening/ending themes. And like with all Japanese dubs, the voice acting was also nothing less than superb.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's wrap everything up into a nice little package.\\n\\n\r\nHaters gonna hate, and I don't say that in a preppy teenager way either. I mean it.\\n\r\nIf every reference to SAO were pulled from Alicization and it were otherwise the exact same thing rebranded into something new, the top 3 reviews wouldn't be negative and the series would absolutely, no question about it, sit a lot closer to an 8.2-8.3 in overall average rating.\\n\\n\r\nThis is SAO, and with how bad the first two seasons were (ESPECIALLY the first), people can't handle SAO being good for once. Because of that single bias against something that's nothing more than a label, the haters will drag every little flaw it has through the dirt until they can make it look so bad that nobody will even be willing to talk about the plethora of things it does insanely well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a crappy season that only casuals praise. Far from it. Anyone saying, thinking, or believing that \"casuals will be casuals\" and that \"watch Alicization, it's SO much better\" is the battle cry of casuals in denial are just foolish. The casuals that made SAO as popular as it is in the first place only existed initially, and since its first year or so of post-airing existence, the series has been considerably dragged through the dirt more and more to the point where there's so few new SAO fans appearing out of thin air these days. The casuals who made the series popular literally 5-6 years ago went from being edgy middle schoolers to now being working, bill-paying adults who likely wouldn't praise the series \"just because it's SAO.\" These are individuals with taste who likely dislike the first two seasons of SAO just as much as you, and only praise Alicization BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, in the end, that's what it all comes down to. People praise Alicization because it's good. They praise it because it does things right. They praise it because instead of the abundance of meaningless \"primary\" characters, there's significantly less characters and all of them have meaning. They praise it because the bland, 2D cardboard cutout protagonist is no longer Jesus-kun, and is now fully a respectable protagonist somewhat worthy of his popularity (though as a whole still quite overrated). They praise it because sometimes you'll even forget Kirito is the same protagonist of the prior 2 crap seasons, just because he's that much different, and when you ARE reminded that he's the same person, it's for a good reason; he flaunts his unique duel-wielding style or he starts wearing his Aincrad clothing without being absurdly overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization has flaws, but they're not the crazy things that so many people consider comparable to the flaws of the first two seasons. Instead, Alicization fixes most of them by creating its own thing that ends up being great due to careful planning and quality writing.\\n\\n\r\nI'm excited for season 2, and for once in my life, I'm starting to think I may have an overall positive view of SAO. Thanks for reading and have a great day!",

            "content": "This Sword Art Online name is no stranger to our ears, starting from video games and even animation. SAO itself now has two franchises, namely SAO produced by A1-pictures / original and \"Gun Gale Online\" produced by studio 3hz. After six The year since the first release of the anime this series has taken many people's attention not only in Japan but throughout the world and their popularity can be said to be the same as Naruto or One Piece. The fifth project from A1-Pictures studio adapted the advanced chapter \"Alicization\" in all chapters Online sword art such as progressive and others, this is thelongest of all the chapters and from the news I heard the alicization series was appointed as an anime which will have 52 episodes / at least 4 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nTells about Kirigaya Kazuto he is a hero who stopped Sword Art Online game which is a deadly game made by Kayaba Akihiko, after completing the SAO game Kirito lived his life casually he was also with his lover Asuna who was saved by him. But that happiness was not always Kirito to meet a former member of Player Killer from Sword Art Online he wanted to avenge the death of those who were in the player killer organization by killing Kirito, but Kirito was saved but he had to struggle to maintain the performance of his brain by entering the \"Alicization\" program designed by the STL company there Kirito became a village person who had two friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline in this series is very long and moves very slowly, it makes some viewers bored with some very predictable clip-parts, in the first episode they are very good at packing several clips into a story that can be said to be a masterpiece but not always it happens right in the middle they lost it all.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Budget Works is not just a name for ufotable studios. A1-pictures are also not inferior to ufotable studios, they crossed the line within themselves to devote all their abilities to this project and the results they could compete with very stunning graphic designs. Their CGI but A1-pictures can match them, regardless of how much money they use to make this series, which is clearly not a small amount of money left in this series, there are some CGI effects that we rarely encounter in other series and I'm sure they are working very hard to For the design of the characters I gave a negative value to this series, basically they designed the same characters by changing a number of looks like their colors and hairstyles to create new characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of their voice that is very good seen from the quality of their voices in stark contrast to the characters they play to match it they must adjust the character they want to play especially the voice actor / seiyuu must fit in the role of character age, age is an important right in quality the voice of the voice must be made as closely as possible to the age of the character they are playing like Kirito who is seventeen years old while the age of the voice actor himself is not like that especially the voice actor also acts as another character in other series as well. This series has at least 4 seasons which means has four different opening and closing themes, the first theme \"Adamaz\" which was performed by LiSA was very good as always she was very passionate in singing high-pitched songs, in this series we came to the two voices we will discuss later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nIn this series we have two new characters, Eugeo and Alice, they are childhood friends of Kirito in the world who are being developed by the STL company. For the voices themselves the studio has been thinking carefully about this which was designated to fill the voice of Eugeo's character and Alice is Shimazaki Nobunaga and Kayano Ai. I rarely hear Shinmazaki Nobunaga's name so I will jump to discuss this one voice, but for Kayano Ai you must have heard her voice in some interesting anime series from Kayano Ai that she can adjust the sound quota with The characters they will play. Back in the discussion of characters in this series who played protagonists are still the same, namely Kirito and Asuna, while for playing antagonists it has not been shown but for the time being I assume that the one who set up the \"integrity knight\" is an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of manga and novels I really like the adaptation of the Sword Art Online series. They are very solid in adapting this series. The presentation of the action scenes they offer is very cool and full of surprises too. After the release of ordinal scale films I thought they had stopped to adapt the Sword Art Online series. because they have made a lot of profits in this business, but after I got the news that A1-pictures will adapt the advanced series Sword Art Online, which is alicization. For the continuation of this series, it is still in the working stage, hopefully in the future they can improve their performance in adapting this series.",

            "content": "First first off, this is like the third time I am posting this because \"I didn't watch enough episodes before.\"\r\nOkay, so first off, let me tell you that I have been an SAO fan for a while, as it will always have a social place in my heart, so if you take my review with a grain of salt that's fine.\r\nSTORY - 9\r\nSo far, the plot looks enticing, and with A-1 Pictures giving SAO Alicization 4 cours instead of 1 or 2, I don't suspect nearly as many plot jumps to happen as there were in SAO season 1. The working principles of the newVR device, the Soul Translator (was in the trailer, not a spoiler), do open up a lot of potholes, however, but so did the concept of the Nervegear. I mean, microwaves?! As we are now 10 episodes in, I see that the story is flowing very nicely, and everything feels well-paced. Episode 10 was a shocker, and it's bumped my story grade up to 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the entirety of the SAO series as well as other animations by A-1 is always very good. Originally, I thought A-1 could only hold the first episode's animation quality for one or two episodes, but boy, was I wrong. This season is rivaling even Ordinal Scale's quality! On a WEEKLY basis, mind you! Maybe they can keep this up for a year (or longer, if the cours are split), and maybe they can't, but even still, I don't expect anything to look worse than an 8/10 by the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nLikewise with the animations, the music in SAO is top notch. Somewhere in the middle of the first episode, it did sound kind of funny when Kirito waved his photon sword in front of the camera (almost like a fart, maybe it's just me), but other than that, I didn't notice any anomalies. As for the soundtrack, it does not disappoint, and fits relatively well with the scenes shown, even if a lot of the soundtrack is reused from previous seasons. After episode one, the soundtrack has been staying solid as well, and so have the sound effects. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so to a lot of people, the characters were the worst point of SAO, so I will try and be impartial here. During the first episode, I did not know which characters would get more time in the spotlight, but it still seemed as though Kirito was OP as always in VR, and Asuna was all over him. No, seriously. I nearly died laughing when she showed Sinon the thing about the heartrate, mainly because of her expression at that point. Bit creepy, but the reasoning behind it is cute, I guess. After three more episodes, I can already tell this will top even the Aincrad arc. For one, Kirito is not unbearably OP, and we get to see his struggles. To not spoil anything, I will just tell you to watch the series yourself. As of episode 10, I can say that characters are developing well, and everything is going great! Antagonists are EXTREMELY hate-able!\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, SAO has always had a special place in my heart, and the first ten episodes have not changed that. If they have, they have made me like it even more! This season is sure to be great, and these first ten episodes (the first one being 47 minutes) definitely did not disappoint. I found myself waiting every week, wanting to know what would happen next. Even if you dislike SAO, I am literally urging you to try this new season out to, at the very least, neutralize negative feelings towards it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Definitely worth a watch, even if you are not an SAO fan. If you have not watched the previous seasons, you will definitely be lost for some parts, so watch them first.",

            "content": "This is by FAR the best SAO season to date.\r\nThis new SAO finally brings new characters who aren't extremely bland, evil, annoying, redundant, and/or useless. We are finally greeted with kirito's new virtual world and faces new challenges that of course include saving someone from a higher power as we've seen countless times. The difference is that this higher power finally is genuinely interesting and the notion of their existence brings up much higher level intellectual subjects such as societal evolution and the theory of knowledge. This new experiment that is being done in the anime is extremely interesting for any computer science and/or philosophystudent and definitely get a 8/10 for the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound are typical of any other SAO season and gets a 9/10 and 9/10 respectively. The new fantasy world is well drawn and vibrant, and sounds are just right in the OP and END.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter and Enjoyment get and 7/10 and 9/10 respectively. The new characters have finally pumped fresh blood into this series, and most of them are fine/good. However, the old and redundant characters are still taking a backseat in what seems like a feline meeting that happens every 1 or 2 episodes. This new SAO is as enjoyable as the good episodes of the first season, it drifts from its old concepts of the VRMMO world which refreshes the entire show well in my perspective.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO: Alicization gets an 8.5/10, would recommend to all of the SAO and MMO fans, also does well for tech fans too.",

            "content": "I tried to like this. I really, really did. I was even sticking out for it upon its announcement because for all of the problems earlier iterations of SAO had, there was always a sense that, if the finer details were checked over and looked at in complete retrospect of what came before, it could be deservedly fun, inspiring or genuinely meaningful. A series deserving of the immeasurable hype phenomenon it generated. Escapism, blurring between actions of reality and fiction was always a thematic that separated the series from the many isekais this decade that followed in its footsteps, and something that held my interestin how it would be handled, but aside from arguably the Mother\u2019s Rosario arc, this wasn\u2019t given enough space in the narrative between all the superfluous anime tropes that seem to be there to draw the most general audience possible. Look no further than the original Aincrad arc, praised most by anime-only fans for its concepts, but forcibly rushed to completion when its author chose to submit a word limited contest draft as the first novel, compared to refining the fully story he wanted to make.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online\u2019s biggest problem is itself. \\n\\n\r\nIts writer, Reki Kawahara, keeps getting in his own way, and when he doesn\u2019t, the anime eschews his vision. What he wants to get across is almost always clear, and there are effortful attempts, but with the anime\u2019s focus on moving the plot forward rather than making details feel elaborately set, it ends up bringing down the entire experience to make watching the series weekly for the most part, feel like a slog of boring exposition attempting to cover up the poor pacing of external events. If something from earlier is justified, it can feel annoyingly retroactive. Even when Kirito himself is less a factor than in previous arcs, he is still partially to blame in the indistinct coverage of how this season adds to the themes of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral spoilers for the season below:\\n\\n\r\nThe main premise of this arc is that Kirito, while on a date with his girlfriend Asuna, is caught off guard and stabbed to near death by one of the three Death Guns from the previous season. While in a coma, he ends up in the digital world of Rath, a system used for a military experimentation project where he must do..............................nothing in particular at no real urgency. There is a plot, and there is a goal, but for once they feel entirely separate from the tension.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll get to that later. SAO, being as popular as it is, has mostly being met with snark and derision from people calling it the \u201cworst ever\u201d or otherwise exaggerating the flaws of it, so I think it\u2019s fair to start off with the positives of this season, because contrary to what haters will tell you, they do exist.\\n\\n\r\n1. Production value and music. These have been consistent strengths of the SAO series throughout the years and generally, they still hold up here. The character models take on the new polished style from the Ordinal Scale Movie, and while not having as much animation (I\u2019ll get to that), the look is maintained very well across all 24 episodes of the show. If you compare to the original two seasons, there is a definite improvement, and while the architecture present isn\u2019t particularly unique or standout, it is well presented. Likewise, Yuki Kajura\u2019s music, while not her best soundtrack, still does what it can to set the mood for the quieter scenes and the action scenes, with a new remix of Swordland to go along with it. Special mention to some of the opening moments of Episode 2, and the fight in Episode 16. Of the music outside of the show, the first OP and the second ED are the best ones and do have a good amount of catchiness and energy to them.\\n\\n\r\n2. Alice Schuberg, the arc\u2019s new female lead. While it takes 16 episodes in to actually really explore her as a character, and she looks a lot like Saber from the Fate series, the time we do have from then on with her sets her as probably the most consistent female lead in SAO so far. As of yet, she\u2019s hasn\u2019t been subjected to an endless supply of ass shots, her growth hasn\u2019t been stunted by time skips, nor is her growth entirely for Kirito\u2019s sake. Her arc of rejecting the corrupt system she\u2019s been brainwashed under, wanting to reconnect with her old life and opening up on her feelings is adequately handled and leads to some of the stronger character moments this season. She also has one of the coolest weapons in terms of both design and animation; a space bending sword acting as moving protection with golden butterflies as weapons. It\u2019s been put to effective use in the fights so far and has potential to be used further as the story moves along.\\n\\n\r\n3. Measuring Kirito\u2019s power. Compared to say, the Phantom Bullet arc, some of the worst aspects of his character are toned down. He doesn\u2019t start the series overpowered from the get-go, has actual struggles in several fights and even takes a few Ls in a couple of them. It gives a couple of the fights in the season more tension than previous ones. The existence of Eugeo also helps for his sake since the show is better able to balance the battles between the two of them rather than giving Kirito the entire spotlight. It doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t still an annoying amount of contrived solutions to conflicts, but that\u2019s more on the writing than him specifically.\\n\\n\r\n4. Actually building the villain. The arc\u2019s villain, a Knight Templar dictator calling herself Quinella, has an established backstory and a defined reason for ruling the way she does. We know why she is the villain, we see the clear consequences of her actions on the world and she isn\u2019t too laughable to be taken seriously. She\u2019s a product of an as of now unknown evil seed, but nonetheless she\u2019s established properly, even if showing her attractive naked body on screen constantly doesn\u2019t work to be alienating for a series that in the past used naked bodies during bath scenes as fanservice. At least her fight with Kirito near the end is mostly entertaining and well matched. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s the positives out of the way. Now for everything else that really breaks this arc and saddens me given the inherent potential of a SAO story.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem that persists throughout the entire show is the immeasurable focus on exposition over every other element. Characters will abandon the idea of development, fighting, talking, world building, or anything else for the opportunity to talk in technical terms about topics that, while somewhat relevant, are not as important as what else could be focused on. Eugeo, the new male lead, has got family issues? No, that's not important. We need to talk about the villain\u2019s plan and \u201cFluctlights\u201d (the series\u2019 pretentious name for digital souls in an indistinct coverage of AI vs humans) again. Knowing how that works is way more important that a main character's backstory. The exposition often brings the narrative to a screeching halt, especially in scenes where the heroes stop fighting the villain and exposition for a few minutes while the villain just stands around waiting for them. \\n\\n\r\nExposition is something inherent in building a setting and establishing the plot. I understand the use for it. There are several shows that have still been entertaining despite or because of their exposition. But SAO Alicization\u2019s exposition is not only incredibly frequent but boring and lacking in character. It\u2019s frequent enough to where Episode 1 spends 10 minutes just expositioning off vague terms about the setting, while half of Episode 12 and nearly all of Episode 13 are nothing but this flat delivery of the plot. Other episodes tend to tag nearly every fight with exposition that\u2019s 8 times longer than the fight itself. While the old director was no exemplar by any means, he at least knew how to make fights seem varied and exciting visually with a lot of movement. Here, Yuki Kajiura puts in the effort, but this new director who directed some of the worst LN adaptations in recent memory like Mahouka and The Asterisk War, just cannot pull it off. So, when the OP makes you think you\u2019ll be getting this epic fight, it\u2019s usually just maybe two attacks apiece preceded and followed by 5-10 minutes of exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe framing device of the season also presents several issues this time around. The idea that Kirito\u2019s exploration in this new world is happening while his real-world body is comatose could generate tension, but this alongside Kirito\u2019s connection to the real world is poorly substantiated. In learning about this framing device, we, as the audience, know it is just a waiting game for Kirito to heal up and be back to normal. Until the very last episode, his actions in Rath have absolutely no consequences in the real world. None of that \u201cdie in the game die in real life\u201d stuff here. He gets really hurt from time to time but we have no idea how his real body is taking it. There\u2019s a two-year timeskip at one point, but unlike in Season 1 where it really was two years, we have no idea how much the time exchange is between the system and the real world which I think hurts the connection to the story. This framing device also separates Kirito from his past connections in this story. I don\u2019t mind the reduced role of his entourage for the moment (even if Asuna, who SHOULD be important, has nothing to do right now), but he barely brings them up over what\u2019s been at least two years. There was one moment Kirito thought of his real-world connections, but that was for a poorly animated fight that ended in a draw and had absolutely no effect going forward. Kirito cries more over the fact that flowers he planted were destroyed (that were contrivedly brought back anyways) than even the chance that he might NEVER see Asuna again being stuck for so long. I want to care, but the show refuses to let me with a framing device that undermines the events and severs past connections.\\n\\n\r\nOther old habits die hard, whether because of Kawhara\u2019s own writing or the adaptation. Not only do we get another ridiculous rapey scene, but there\u2019s a two-year timeskip rather than say, actually seeing Kirito and Eugeo train up to be better swordsman. They set off for the Capital and the next we see them, BOOM, two years pass, and they\u2019ve already had a lot of training done. They could\u2019ve at least done an FMA03 type thing by building character relationships prior to a timeskip but nope, nearly all relationships at the sword academy are shown after and as of now, doesn\u2019t matter to anything since we know so little about them. If this was better in the light novel, good for Kawahara, but perhaps it should\u2019ve been a cause for concern seeing how much got cut for the anime onlys. In this adaptation, the only purpose of the sword academy stuff, aside from telling us Kirito and Eugeo became better swordsmen offscreen, was to build two bullies as irredeemable rapey monsters, and paint two cute girls as victims of this. We don\u2019t know much about them either, aside from one of them having a romance arc with Eugeo that goes absolutely nowhere. There\u2019s also a lot of contrivances to make progress, like with Kirito seeing the \u201cghost\u201d of Alice in Episode 4 lead him the right way, how Cardinal is introduced into the story specifically to ex Machina Kirito and Eugeo out of a scene, and how Kirito uses a completely unknown attack to one shot a late-game villain that returns him to his Black Swordsman coat for a bit. This attack is never referred to by name and never mentioned again. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not like this progress has done well for the characters, as Alice aside, they range from passable to horribly flat. Kirito isn\u2019t as overpowered as before, but aside from problems the framing device puts on him, he still has annoying moments, like one case where he retroactively Sherlocked his way to avoid being poisoned, or where he used a device he only had two of on a character he barely knew, rather than to potentially stop the villain and save Alice. The show puts him in the right for this by the way, and there\u2019s not much of an arc for him this season either. Cardinal is actually pretty decent, even if the show\u2019s use of her as an ex Machina isn\u2019t for the best. The sword academy characters are barely developed at all, and among the antagonists, only Bercouli and Deusolbert are passable; the rest are just obnoxious. Fanatio\u2019s only character trait is being ashamed of being a woman, which falls deaf when both the main villain and Alice, whom she knows personally, are also women, as well as there being no indication of gender division in the world. And Chudelkin\u2019s only purpose is to ruin the tone and make rapey faces whenever possible until kill stealing at the end.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us to the biggest wasted potential so far, Eugeo. There was a lot of potential for his character at the start. Being a guy partner to help balance Kirito out of the spotlight, there was a lot Kawahara could do with what he distinctly did not know about Kirito, his personal relationships with him and Alice as kids, his fighting ability, the idea that he has more innate fighting potential than Kirito, his unawareness of being an AI program and his romantic relationship to Tiese. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, not one of these elements get to shine in this adaptation to let us in on his blank sheet personality. Perhaps improved in the light novel, but the anime should have better stood on its own. Him having more innate potential than Kirito is completely ignored later on, his sword training is told not shown, and anything the show tries to pull regarding his relationships with Kirito/Alice as kids, his family, or Tiese fall completely deaf because they received little to no focus. The show would rather go into long tirades of exposition than show a main character\u2019s backstory! Near everything about him was entirely cut short by the show despite having more than enough time to act on all of it. They try their best to make up for it at the end, but it\u2019s a bit too little too late.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether I\u2019m more annoyed or disappointed with how Alicization has been executed so far. Sure, some of the problems in the world, characters and framing device can be fixed going forward, but first impressions are everything and this series did not make a good one. The focus on constant exposition over all else, the disconnected framing device, and lackluster character writing drag it down more than needed, but it could\u2019ve been avoided if Kawahara just knew what to focus on or the anime didn\u2019t skim over the better parts, since his ideas are abundantly clear. The SAO franchise can theoretically explore a lot, but it almost deliberately gets written into corners. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve always given SAO over the many works that have almost no effort at all to act on their ideas, and though there\u2019s that chance for the future with new elements coming in to make the second half an improved experience, this season\u2019s quality suggests it won\u2019t be without a wide range of caveats.\\n",

            "content": "In a world where popular light novels gets anime, manga, games, and hell, even live action movies, there\u2019s one title I\u2019m sure no anime fan can ignore. Sword Art Online. Becoming ever more popular and entering a mainstream line of anime adaptations, the franchise has also no doubt sparked decent deal of controversy. But hey, controversy sometimes makes cash right? \r\nIt\u2019s not rocket science to realize SAO would eventually get a continuation. It was just a matter of when and after 5 years since the second season, the time is now. Sword Art Online Alicization covers the light novels with an extended amount of material,much more than the previous season. It\u2019s so much that in fact, a full 2-cour season of 24 episodes isn\u2019t enough. Luckily, it has been confirmed the series would run more than that and given an additional season for its adaptation. However, the big question people should ask themselves if this is another SAO show to jump into or a cash grab at making more money.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the prologue, we get a double length episode to give a general background of the new season. Make no mistake though as Alicization is not going to spoonfeed viewers with recapping. The show assumes you are familiar with the first two shows so anyone hoping to watch this needs to have completed the first two seasons. Light novel adaptations tends to suffer a lot from adaptation standards but thankfully, Alicization manages to deliver a faithful start with its character cast and storytelling. Besides Kirito, we are introduced to Eugeo, a new character who serves as his partner and best friend in this arc. Similar to Kirito, he has a kind heart although lacks experience in the beginning compared to him. He also appears somewhat cowardly in the beginning as he is unable to prevent certain events from happening, in particular for failing to help his childhood friend Alice. It\u2019s not until he meets Kirito that he develops a resolve and finds the courage to become a stronger person. That is to say, Alicization features a lot of character bonding especially in the first half of the show. Eugeo begins to grow out of his shell after training and becoming strong enough to fight as a warrior. It really shouldn\u2019t take long to realize that he has great potential, perhaps even someday of surpassing Kirito himself. As for Kirito, his personality remain largely the same in this season. That is, he is a selfless person who isn\u2019t afraid to help others in need. Kirito and Eugeo develops great respect for each other and the latter even finds his resolve. The two sometimes almost feel like brothers. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the duo, you may have noticed another prominent character being featured in the trailers or key visuals. Alice would be her name and she is Eugeo\u2019s childhood friend. The show makes it clear that she is an important character from her introduction to later on in the story. Alicization also devotes time to developing her character after meeting Kirito. Despite having a rocky start, she develops respect and a growing trust for him. Now, people may have a curiousity if Alice become another \u2018harem girl\u2019 similar to some of the previous seasons. SAO is not a harem although it gives off a stench at times. Thankfully, there\u2019s no need to worry. The closest that Alice seems to be with Kirito is when they are at the tower during one of the episodes and nothing more comes out of it. On the other hand, Kirito\u2019s friends from the real world are still concerned about his well-being. In particular, Asuna searches for him through unorthodox methods while discovering some revelations about the technology in the real world. Remember, the world of SAO contains complex technology that defies the law of nature. I\u2019m not even referring the VR system or robotics but rather the capability of influencing people\u2019s lives. This extends to the virtual world where the Administrator managed to use system commands to reverse her own age. Sounds unbelievable, right?\\n\\n\r\nAs with previous seasons, Alicization can\u2019t be complete without antagonists and conflicts. One of the major antagonist in the new season is the Administrator, Quinella and her Integrity Knights. She\u2019s an important character as not only is she a threat to the main protagonists but also a catalyst for some of the key events in this season. This includes character manipulation that extends to our new characters such as Eugeo and Alice. I\u2019m not going to lie though, one of the events in this show is rather disturbing to watch considering the way she manipulates others. (I\u2019m looking at you, Eugeo) On even more disturbing matters, we even have characters that commits unforgiveable sins that pushes Eugeo to the edge. It\u2019s the type of event that brings controversy out of its fullest. I\u2019m not going to spoil it but when you get to that particular episode, you\u2019ll feel disgusted too. It\u2019s so disturbing that it even changes Eugeo\u2019s views on the laws of their world and causes him to rebel. Quinella herself also demonstrates a God-like complex with her own dark motives. If I said it once, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times. She is detestable. I doubt anyone with a sane mind would find her character likable. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t be the only one to notice that the animation quality improved more than the previous seasons, right? The Ufotable-like animation is used in parallel with the Sword Art Online movie, Ordinal Scale. Not only did the animation style improve, it also managed to craft an imaginative virtual world to it its fullest. The character designs are also featured in great details compared to previous seasons. In particular, Alice is important to note for her chivalrous look and golden armor. Character expressions are meaningful with an emphasis put on human emotions. Eugeo is a prominent example especially as his personality shifts from a weak survivor to a noble swordsman. While I\u2019m not impressed by how antagonist are portrayed this season, they were able to deliver their dialogues straight with a degree of villainous expressions. Quinella is the biggest culprit with her manipulative personality. Her malevolence simply cannot be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe SAO franchise is one of the longer light novel running adaptations that continues to build more into its universe. Truthfully and despite some of the controversy from the past seasons, this one managed to finally jump out of its rabbit hole and deliver what I wanted to see. With another season on the way, I cross my fingers that it will ride on this momentum.",

            "content": "The anime community seems to be split in its opinion on SAO. Half of them ignore everything positive about it and only talk about negetive things. The other half just does the opposite. No other anime has been this controversial for more than 5 years after its original release. Now here is a new season that features mostly different cast from the original. So is it worth watching or not? Here is my analysis:-\r\n**THIS WILL INCLUDE MINOR SPOILERS ABOUT THE OVERALL SETTING **\r\nThe story this time is centered not on a game, but around a simulation of civilization. The aim of this simulation is todevelop highly advanced A.I capable of thoughts and emotions. It brings about some ethical questions about humanity, playing God, and where to draw the line in scientific experiments. This season deals with more of these mature themes than the previous seasons ever did.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that Kirito finds himself in a medieval world with its own history and lore and journeys with his newfound friend Eugeo to achieve both of their (different) goals. It starts out slow, with a lot of focus on world building. Even though it seems disconnected to the plot of the previous seasons, eventually many plot points from before will make their way into the story. So it is important to watch the last seasons to get a full understanding of the current season.\\n\\n\r\nEugeo is the focus of these two cours, Kirito just tagging along. He has an innocent, easygoing personality that makes the story work - much like Frodo from Lord of the Rings. He is the embodiment of a common citizen of Underworld. His opinions about himself, others and the society he is in changes throughout the story and the viewers get to experience the same things he does. Alice has not much role in the initial part, but her time for development will come in the 3rd and 4th cours.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike SAO's history, there is pain and blood in the fights. It makes the characters' struggle believable and makes you root for the characters. Later on, the story gets even more darker without resorting to plain bloodshed - in a psychological way. Kirito is not overpowered in this arc. He only has the knowledge of a swordsman and works his way from the bottom up.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is well thought out and is planned beforehand. There are several questions that arise in the early episodes - the answers are made clear slowly, as the plot progresses. Some of the things happened may seem irrelevant and random, but they make sense eventually.\\n\\n\r\nA large number of new characters are introduced in this season. Most of them influence main characters in various ways. The three main characters undergo some changes throughout the series and get some good character development. But the same cannot be said about the side characters.These characters last only for about 3 episodes and don't make an appearence till the 2nd part of this arc, but the gap is too long.\\n\\n\r\nThe review will be incomplete if the villain is not mentioned. It is an ambitious character capable of easily manipulating others for personal gain that ended up turning into a different and dangerous entity due to an accident. Certainly there are better villains in the anime history, but this character is arguably the best villain SAO has seen so far. There is a moral ambiguity for this character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of criticisms that can be offered as well. Some episodes have a lot of talking involved. A lot of exposition is delivered this way. People expecting all out action scenes will be disappointed or bored by these episodes. There is some pseudo-science explanation for the premise. It may not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe tower climbing arc is adapted very poorly. The Integrity knights that are supposed to have their own reasons and understandings about the world around them are dumbed down to mere villains of the week. The cliffhangers are conceived in a very poor way. They feel forced and unnecessary because most of the fights are very short.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime looks gorgeous with colorful shading - just like Ufotable. But the same can't be said about action sequences. In many action sequences, the frame of animation focuses only on one character. It makes the viewer unable to follow the fights well. The short fights are usually already ended by the time we get invested into them. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is underwhelming compared to the last seasons. Old music is repeatedly used by remixing it. Only few soundtracks are memorable and they don't last long. Some of them sound very similar to Yuki Kajiura's other works. Only new notable music is the Eugeo's theme and the Quinella's theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation of the source material is below average. It is not butchered to Tokyo Ghoul Re's extent, but it is significantly rushed and cuts out a good amount of inner monologues that gives a good understanding of character relations and motivations. Think of the GGO arc that lasted for 14 episodes but now compress it into 8 episodes. That is how much rushed it actually is. Even so, everything that has happened can still be understood with some thought.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr - If you liked the previous seasons, it is a must watch.\\n\r\nIf you thought that the previous seasons were wasted potential then this is still worth watching as it explores a different theme - in far more detail.\\n\r\nHowever if you didn't like the original characters of SAO, then better stay away from this season. Chances are that you will not like this season either.\\n\\n\r\nThere is still two more cours to come. But that is a different entry in the database. Be informed that the story doesn't end yet.\\n\r\nFor me, what is great about this arc are its themes and execution, albeit the poor adaptation.",

            "content": "Before we begin, be sure to check out Ordinal Scale, a movie of the franchise that\u2019s events take place prior to the main story here. So here we are, back again with another installment (the 3rd) of Sword Art Online that follows the adventures in the virtual reality world of prestigious gamer, Kirito. If you\u2019ve gotten this far with into the franchise, you either loved the excellent blend of its infamous time-jumping storytelling and iconic big fights from the past or hoping for a season that lives up to its promise with a better-paced story and less formulaic plotting. Alicization is the best of both,and while it occasionally falls back to its tropes of old, it still manages to weave a compelling story regardless of its flaws.\\n\\n\r\nLike it\u2019s previous seasons, Alicization plays out in two timelines\u2014one inside the game and the other in the real world. This time around, Gun Gale Online and Aifheim are included, as the production team at A-1 Pictures are tying the past seasons together to form a more cohesive narrative. The first cour has consistent pacing and a great deal of characterization. The second cour raises the stakes, the battles become a lot more grandiose, some instances of revisiting some old tropes which is unfortunate. But an issue with both is the dedicated episodes of heavy exposition to explain the world in which Kirito now finds himself in. While informal, it gets a bit tedious, especially in parts where Asuna and the Cardinal are given ample screen time. But in retrospect, it is needed as the previous seasons sprinted to the finish line without taking the time to properly build up its world, which is something Alicization does right. \\n\\n\r\nThe techno-logic of Sword Art Online has been both impressive and questionable, raising many eyebrows at times. But the logic behind the new tech, \u201cSoul Translator\u201d, is interesting\u2014as it renders the virtual world via memories, instead of polygons, this virtual world is practically indistinguishable from the real world, as every object within the virtual world is at the same level as the real thing in the user's consciousness. The artificial intelligence that is developed for Project Alicization is based on the structure of a human's brain, in order to create an artificial intelligence with awareness and the adaptability level of a human. The rest of the concept that follows is fascinating\u2014the idea that artificial intelligence can be built from the bottom up\u2014can be born, grow, learn and develop with its own unique experiences to guide it. And this is what makes this specific virtual reality world that Kirito is now in, with the addition of newer characters in Eugeo and Alice, all the more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nIn the Underworld (name of the virtual reality world), time passes by a lot quicker than it does in the real world, we get to see Kirito and Eugeo grow up together over the course of a few years. We get a sense of the world through their eyes as well as their interactions within it. Here, Kirito (well sort of) starts off with a blank slate, somethings such as skills from previous games haven\u2019t transferred over, he also can\u2019t log out and some of his memory is distorted. So, the tense feelings that existed in Aincard seep through to Alicization. This also allowed Kirito to take on a different role as more of a mentor to Eugeo, who shares the limelight. This is an interesting dynamic as not only has Kirito taken a step back as the main hero, but we get another male character who can carry the story, overcome the obstacles and challenges in their mission to locate and save Alice, and also be a capable chick-magnet himself. There is a bromance between them, the chemistry they have is to the likes of Batman and Robin, just that the 'Robin' here is a lot more prominent.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization does well to add in some surprises and twists along the way, especially around the whereabouts of Alice, the Integrity Knights, and the presence of the Cardinal and the Administrator. This bright flame of promise at the start of the season starts to flicker from time to time, mainly from the sometimes-excessive expositions and instances of Deus ex Machina but starts to burn brightly as the story reaches its climax stages. The interesting part of Alicization is the questions the series is posing in regards to ethics, morality and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s territory the show has dived into a bit before but never deeply as in this season when the inhabitants of the Underworld are beholden to a \u201cTaboo Index\" of laws that aren\u2019t actually moral in and of themselves. Which brings me to the #MeToo scene that happens in episode 10. For starters, there is a warning of strong and explicit content before the episode starts. Although I understand the reasoning behind the decision to include such a thing, to show the immorality of the Taboo Index but it could have done without. Admittedly, even though it\u2019s a serious issue but I pissed myself laughing how ridiculous one of the nobles looked when he was flying on to the bed.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Alicization is one of the best-looking anime of the season, and Sword Art Online has that reputation in general so it\u2019s to be expected every time from A-1 Pictures when they are working with this series, Sword Art Online continues to set the benchmark for quality and beauty unrivaled in the genre. The artwork is gorgeous, background arts are vigor and vibrant, brimming with tiny animated details, great use of graphical effects or the masterful use of colors combine to provide a visual spectacle of wonder and delight. Character models are detailed and still hold that trademark look. The animation is solid, it makes the choreography of action sequences very crisp and smooth, and they have incorporated new and old camera techniques and special effects to not only maintain but enhanced the quality of the visual spectacle of the battles. A-1 Pictures still uses some of the classic soundtracks as well as newer ones that are really epic. LiSA\u2019s OP and ED themes once again capturing the feeling of the anime perfectly, and the voice acting maintains its quality from the prequels. \\n\\n\r\nAlicization is Sword Art Online\u2019s biggest and most ambitious story arc with a lot more mystery, suspense, and darker themes. If you loved the first two seasons then you\u2019ll likely enjoy this continuation of Kirito\u2019s virtual adventures. The entire show is amazingly detailed with a real eye for color and fluid animation. The idea of having all three seasons being tied together is a nice touch and the characterization along with the new virtual world is generally intriguing and well designed. The time jumps are not much of an issue this time around but they do make their way back and in doing so, offset the pacing momentarily. Alicization is definitely one of the better installments of the franchise to date. It was unable to completely shake off the issues that held it back in previous seasons but was still enjoyable with a lot of more interesting concepts. Looking forward to 3rd and 4th cours, and more of Alice.\\n",

While respecting that it is some what of a pioneer, the story tends to drag on unnecessarily and almost constantly views it's audience as unintelligent by walking everyone by the hand through plot points rather than allowing us to infer what is happening through context. It's SAO, so not watching doesn't make sense, but keeping it as a lower priority view  for this season is recommended. \r\nWhile the art is enjoyable and clean, they've left out other potentially visceral aspects. The story and characters are nothingnew, though aren't they expected to be, and the sound is underwhelming. Not pair the vivid enough visuals with similarly heavy sounds seems like some sort of crime. Episodes keep leaving potential on the table to the point that they cause annoyance. I can see more enthusiastic fans of the genre being irritated during viewing. Passive viewing is simply the most probable way to watch this series, which isn't that surprise, but is a little disappointing.",

            "content": "Overpowered characters.\r\nFrom invincible action heroes to divinely powered chosen ones, \r\nfrom arbitrary powerup masters to \"willpower over logic\" crusaders,\r\nfrom technobabble technicians to omniscient pseudo-strategists, \r\nfrom plot-powered self-inserts to absurdly popular harem leads.\r\nPerfect in every conceivable way... except in terms of actually being well-written or compelling. And therein lies the problem with so many of them. Being overpowered is one thing, but they suffer from something far worse: being boring. They simply come across as bland and generic.\r\nAnd I am not referring to the fact that they crush their opponents with ease. What I am saying is that their personality, motivations and dialogue tend to bedull. It is not just about the characters themselves though. It is rather that the way the narratives are written, these characters are not challenged to question their values or develop their wit in any significant way. They are not allowed to truly think.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut don't just take my word for it. Let's hear it from the man himself:\\n\\n\r\n\"A human being's greatest power is to think. It's more powerful than any great sword or secret move.\"\\n\r\n\u2012 Kirigaya Kazuto\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? Kirito is right. This is precisely the main problem here. In Sword Art Online, the narrative too often focuses on swords and secret moves (read: plot-based powerups) over actual thought.\\n\\n\r\nAnd he must have first-hand experience. After all, Kirito is the patron saint of overpowered characters, and you probably know why. He is the best swordsman in the land by a wide margin. He obtains arbitrary powerups whenever the plot demands it. He has saved the day from random villains. He has won the affection of many girls for poorly established reasons. He knows random technical details that nobody else seems to. He might not be the absolute worst offender on the anime scene, but he is perhaps the most notorious, due to the runaway popularity of the franchise. \\n\\n\r\nBut the true measure of a character is not his list of combat achievements but his personality, wit, moral struggle, perhaps even ideology.\\n\\n\r\nKirito tends to selflessly save the day and help everyone. His antagonists are either comically evil or their motives are vague, incomprehensible, or otherwise poorly established. This is done so that we never have to question Kirito's moral superiority. He is the good guy, the hero, the shining knight. To enforce this, everybody seems to like him to an implausible degree, except for the aforementioned comically evil antagonists. Consider what this does to the narrative. Because most of Kirito's friends and associates adore him, there is little meaningful conflict between them, and meaningful conflict is at the heart of good narratives.\\n\\n\r\nAnd note that we are supposed to take all of this unironically. We are supposed to relate to a nigh-perfect protagonist who never has to struggle with any moral dilemmas of any kind because he is always placed in a position in which the antagonists are over-the-top evil or their motives are incomprehensible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the emphasis is on \"placed.\" We don't usually get to see different sides of Kirito \u2012 aside from his role as a heroic savior \u2012 precisely because he is always placed in situations in which he is inclined to become a heroic savior. As I mentioned, he is facing sub-par villains, and he is also provided with the convenient opportunity to defeat them. This is precisely why he comes across as bland. At least, he has so far in the franchise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what does Alicization do to change this? Maybe a little. The premise is a little less black-and-white than some of the previous iterations and presents some moral ambiguity, but it is still fairly clear which of the characters are intended as antagonistic. The narrative also reverts to old patterns in this respect sometimes. I'll get back to this later.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also another notable issue. It seems as though the author sat down and figured, \"Hmm, you know what this show needs? More exposition infodumps.\"\\n\\n\r\n...which the show was never lacking in the first place and which does nothing to resolve the actual problems with the franchise. \\n\\n\\n\r\n1) First, it is time for the glorious infodumps. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, this show comes with encyclopedic lists of technical details. So have fun with rants about Fluctlights, Stacia Windows, the Gigas Cedar, the High-Norkian Style, and the Light Quantum Gate Crystal. There is no shortage of these infodumps, and soon enough you notice that another episode is gone just like that.\\n\\n\r\nAs an example, here is a quote from Kirito himself.\\n\\n\r\n\"Where do you think the human soul is located? [...] The brain is more or less a clump of brain cells, right? So where among the brain cells does the soul exist? All cells, including brain cells, are supported by a structural network. Apparently, they're called microtubules. Tubes. In other words, hollow pipes. And there's something sealed inside those hollow pipes. [...] Light. Light. A fluctuating light photon. And that's what comprises the human soul, according to Rath.\"\\n\\n\r\n...What?\\n\\n\r\nIs that how it works? Given the context of the story, I am going to be generous and assume that \"soul\" is a metaphor for memories, personality and other mental qualities that comprise a human being. This may be giving the author too much credit. Perhaps he really is referring to souls in a literal sense. Who knows? \\n\\n\r\nKirito calls these lights Fluctlights. The thing is, they don't seem to contribute anything substantial that would not already be conveyed by memories or other mental qualities. Every reference to Fluctlights could be replaced by words like \"memory\" or \"mind.\"\\n\\n\r\ne.g. \"Artificial Fluctlight\" -> \"Artificial intelligence\"\\n\\n\r\nIt would get the relevant meaning across even without the imaginary technology. If your dialogue begins to sound like like an engineering booklet when a simple existing description would have sufficed, you are doing it wrong. \\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, it seems that one of the main points the show is getting at is the fact that people are who they are because of their memories. A fair point but one that has already been overused in speculative fiction. If you want to take that route, you need to beef up your analysis and related dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nNow, don't get me wrong. I can enjoy world-building, but you should not flood the viewer with arbitrary facts for the sake of itself. The details of the world should be constructed so that they support the underlying themes of the narrative. The world-building should actually pay off. For instance, do we need to spend several minutes on the origins of a legendary blade when it has nothing of substance to contribute? In comparison, when the show explains basic facts about their society, the information is actually quite a bit more helpful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat is not the worst of it though. It is not only about the sheer quantity of the exposition but the way in which it is told. There is a right way and a wrong way to provide this information. You should do it naturally, in a manner that actual people might use. \\n\\n\r\nListen to this dialogue.\\n\\n\r\n\"Who would've thought that after [insert event here], we'd actually [insert event here]? Sometimes I think I'm dreaming.\"\\n\r\n\"Come on now. It's already been a year since [insert event here].\"\\n\\n\r\nHow convenient. The characters are recapping the events out loud just when the audience needs the info. They go on for a while, listing various facts about their new pastimes and acquaintances. It is all screaming \"This is exposition!\"\\n\\n\r\nKirito comes across as a kind of Mr. Exposition sometimes, now more than ever. He is all about providing lists of random facts. He lists descriptions of things to the viewer without thinking deeply into their implications. And, incidentally, the other characters do very much the same, often even more so. Just listing facts all day, every day.\\n\\n\r\nAll those lines could have been spent on other things. They could undergo some inner struggle every now and then. There might even be interesting moral conflict. Or how about examining their relationships with other people? But nope. While those other aspects receive some attention, they are usually pushed to the side in favor of further infodumps. Character interaction is really bogged down by this. If you have people acting as though they are reading straight out of an encyclopedia, they become difficult to relate to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter backstories are sometimes treated in the same way. On one occasion, an important character is introduced by delivering an 8-minute flashback infodump on their backstory before ever meeting them. They have never even been mentioned before. You can probably see the problem here. Can't we at least wait until the character has been introduced normally?\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the 8-minute flashback in question is narrated by another person throughout. Why? As I was saying, the flashback should wait, but if we must go forward with it, at least show it from the perspective of the relevant character. Show, don't tell.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) Furthermore, too much time and effort is spent on fight scenes that \u2012 while visually fine \u2012 contribute little to the narrative and are resolved in a fairly arbitrary manner. \\n\\n\r\nWhen this is taking place, the dialogue also becomes very centered on explaining the flow of the battle and little else. One episode was almost entirely about swords. Swords clashing repeatedly with simple choreography (mostly people pushing their swords against each other), with the majority of the dialogue focused on swords, swordsmanship and all things related to the weapons in question. This is related to section 1) because much of this is yet another subset of unnecessary technobabble and infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you are a diehard sword fan, this may be acceptable. (Or not if you don't like their portrayal of swordsmanship, and I can't really blame you.) But what if you are not into swords that much? I mean, the technical details. You'll have to sit through endless infodumping on the subject. Sure, the word \"sword\" is right there in the name of the franchise, but come on now. Twenty minutes of non-stop ranting about swords is a bit too much. You know, even fight scenes could be used for character development, moral struggle, etc., but that would take a different approach to dialogue and inner thoughts. Or at least try to be wittier about it. Don't just list the sword techniques in a bland manner.\\n\\n\r\nSo what determines the winner of a sword fight? Finely tuned tactics? No, of course not. In this world, the best way to power up your sword is... strength of will. Yes. You can pretty much beat anyone if you infuse your sword with your imagination, emotion and various reasons to fight. Along with it, various names of sword styles will be mentioned, but they do not seem to affect the outcome in any consistent way, nor are they used tactically in any way that would generate interest. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result, the battles easily devolve into showdowns of plot power. The winner is the one favored by the narrative. This is far from rare in shows that involve action scenes or various powerups, so this should not come as a surprise, but that does not mean that we should let it slide.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3) And now for another fan favorite: over-the-top evil villains.\\n\\n\r\nHere's another quote from Kirito:\\n\\n\r\n\"That attitude your father taught you, Tiese, in Eng... no, in sacred terms, it's called 'noble obligation.' Nobles, that is, those with power must use it for the sake of the powerless. Let's see, you could also call it pride. And that pride is more important than any law or regulation. After all, there are things that you shouldn't do, even if it's not forbidden by law. And on the other hand, there might be things you should do, even if they are forbidden by law.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit better than what we would usually expect of Sword Art Online. It is also relevant to the premise and underlying themes. You see, this time the author has come up with an eerie medieval rural dystopia ruled by a dogmatic church. If this sounds familiar, you may have seen one in any number of JRPGs or fantasy in general. Which isn't necessarily a bad idea if done right. \\n\\n\r\nYou could use this line of thought to demonstrate why dystopian dogmatic churches are, well, dystopian and dogmatic. There is also some shady manuevering going on in the real world. Maybe it could be applied to that.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least in theory. Guess what kind of evil action Kirito is referring to? As is tradition in Sword Art Online, the evil action is... sexually harassing a girl.\\n\\n\r\nYes. You heard it right. Out of all possible evil deeds out there, the author went with sexually harassing a girl. Again. Or rather beyond mere harassment and in an absurdly over-the-top way as well. If this sounds familiar, you must have been watching Sword Art Online because this keeps happening like clockwork. When the author wants to designate a character as evil or antagonistic, this is his go-to trope. The villains tend to commit sexual harassment or attempted rape, as if they wouldn't be evil enough otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nThe author does this because he doesn't want the audience to have the slightest doubt over who is good and who evil here. So the villains just have to go for the same old sexual harassment or attempted rape. It would not have to be this way. There are other morally questionable things in the world, but nope. Can't write about those. Is the author legally obligated to write about sexual harassment and attempted rape, or does he not know that other topics exist?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what is Alicization supposed to be?\\n\\n\r\nA straight-up heroic fantasy?\\n\r\nA technobabble infodump? \\n\r\n\"We are who we are because of our memories.\"\\n\\n\r\n...Is that really all? This is not enough. Instead of original or inspired, Alicization comes across as bland. Yes, there is a fantasy world out there, arguably fleshed out by the infodumps, but that isn't enough. You also need to do something interesting with the world. The narrative needs more substance.\\n\\n\r\nRemember when I quoted Kirito earlier on the superiority of thought over swords? He said so in the context of applying critical thought to law and morality. Fine. So give him a proper chance to think about it in detail and apply it in an interesting way. Instead, he (and sadly us, the viewers) are subjected to endless lists of arbitrary facts that are meaningless on their own. Or we get to witness action scenes which are resolved by plot power or used as platforms for even more infodumping.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the talk about human souls, it is precisely what the narrative is lacking. Where is the humanity?",

            "content": "[Spoilers]\r\nCovers as much ground as it can, but doesn't go in depth with anything it introduces. Lots of pointless content and irrelevant characters. Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue. Wine is often being drank when these conversations are had. Various things being shown from multiple different perspectives, or rather; realities. Hardly any plot advancement because showing a million different things is prioritized above all else. Good moments are scarce and typically enjoyable only because they suck so bad, but in most cases, the thing is just idiotic in a highly boring way and that's the end of this story. No, I didn't accidentally post my 'Legend of theGalactic Heroes' review under wrong entry, but am actually talking about Sword Art Online: Alicization. Show which I was supposed to watch ironically and laugh whenever anything happens, but the problem is that so often nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\n[Setup - Basically sums up episode 1]\\n\\n\r\nThe story start off with wood chopping and sandwich making scenes. Fair enough, Kirito trains and the newest harem addition shows how she contains many essential \"ideal female\" characteristics, such as being able to make sandwiches and knowing how to read because she is smart. Well, I didn't laugh there, but the mary sue factors seemed quite potentially lol-worthy, and that was just the beginning so whatever, I watched more.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, these three kids (they are kids now and there is 3 of them, and I still don't know who the third is, 2nd: Alice) go in this cave where some dragon used to dwell and they steal some ice from him Iunno what the fuck is happening, but they get lost and eventually end up in this place called dalukuu dellidoly (dark territory in English), and apparently crossing the border there is not simply illegal but super illegal. Just so happens to be this Alice girl is also showing how she is bit of a klutz -- which is another ideal female characteristics if someone doesn't know -- and falls down so her 3 finger tips cross the border and gets sentenced to death/is kidnapped. Lucky for them the 3rd kid awakens his Sharingan this very moment and not all hope is lost.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this we teleport back into season 2 of Sword Art Online (I guess) because Kirito is now an adult female or a man with ridiculously long hair in this one and there are lolies with guns and evil people wearing masks all around. This part was pretty fun because Kirito and his/hers buddies use light sabers and there is another dude here who has sharingan, I wonder who on earth he might be and how these things are relevant. This is me trying to connect the dots and at the same time my facial expression when watching it ._.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I had almost dropped the series. I was like \"holy shit, I swear this episode is at least 50 minutes long and never ends.\" but then I noticed it is actually a double episode and literally 50 minutes long. That didn't really help, tho, since I was only 20 minutes in.. but I wasn't technically wrong, so I continued.\\n\\n\r\n15 minutes later I came back to reality and realized I had been watching a scene where Kirito and harem have this really important conversation about some LED lights placed in the human soul or something, and lots of smart science stuff about some nerdy shit / someone trying to explain something regarding another thing, but it was basically about time functioning differently inside virtual reality, mind teleportation and finally confirmed this whole thing was actually inspired by Alice in Wonderland, which I had accidentally taken as a meme for years.... Neat. \\n\\n\r\nWell, at least this was followed with some cringe-ass confession scene which was concluded with a terribly animated kiss just to remind viewers that lots of deep love to be found here, after which some random dude attacks Kirito who then wakes up in the alternative kids world which seen in the beginning and is like \"oh yeah, this is the nerdy science shit virtual WORLD I just had a 15 minute dialogue about.\" How convenient, chaotically random and still didn't make me laugh because too boring, and more like offensively bad than lol-worthy. At least his body in real world paralyzed or something which is kinda cool and also happened in season 1, technically.. boy I wonder if he can ever turn back normal..\\n\\n\r\n[Story]\\n\\n\r\nWe have NPC's - just like in many/any other video games, and just like in many cyberpunk series: they are becoming self-aware, influenced by feelings and questioning their purpose in life. The vanity, the thought-provoking content and emotional depth create us a narrative that is about as fun to watch as it is intelligent. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, the entire main plotline in this alternative world is practically incredibly slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks with episodic cliffhangers instead of trying to master or advance anything it already has going on. Pretty much half of the damn thing is slice of life or sol-like filler that serves no real purpose in the series, other than to make it more lengthy. And so far, the main plotline in the real world is basically also a slowly moving rescue arc that keeps on introducing new content and side tracks..... Well, I guess point delivered: some similarities exist among the plots. Great. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of directing or whatever we want to call it, scenes change with so little continuity and start playing out so randomly that it becomes highly noticeable: it stands out. This thing hasn't been build on very solid basis or structured in a passable manner. This level of story telling and directing would not be praised were this a new franchise. For example, even though the main storyline seems to be going nowhere, the series still has lots of content and is overall rather creating the illusion of fast pace and eventful story while really nothing happens.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite part of the writing so far has been Alice's astral projection just teleporting inside Kirito's brain because I am not sure if that was actually foreshadowing regarding the nerdy technology shite or just her being used as a plot device to allow the story advance. By allowing it to advance, I don't mean it actually advanced because things like chopping trees are prioritized over such things. This is the part that offered at least some lulz.  The melodrama is also incredible because after Kirito was attacked he became some type of vegetable in the real world and lots of girls are real worried and crying. Such pathetic, try-hard shit-writing it's hard not to laugh when the thing is essentially worse written than average fanfiction. I just wish this was the main side of the story. Maybe later episodes will turn this thing into some sort of Sword Art Online 0, a story about depressed Asuna. #not_a_reference I dream. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\n'The Devil is a Part-Timer', anime from 2013, anyone? So this time around Kirito has a nice little side job, making Jesus a Part-Timer, too. Hah! Kirito is being Kirito here. The difference being that this time around he is not the most flawless being from day one, which is kinda cool I guess, especially when considering how the training side of this thing has been among the strongest parts of the series thus far. Still sucks, tho.\\n\\n\r\nHis name is Eugeo! The third kid I mean. His role in the series is pretty much solely to tell Kirito some lore, fill him with information regarding the world and say out loud how impossible and things are and how amazing Kirito can be. Occasionally he also does some incredibly stupid decisions and fucks everything uppa. I am not going to spoil how badly, but I did laugh there. \\n\\n\r\nAlice's sister is pretty cute so I guess that's something + that carrying scene [by Kirito, naturally] was flawless in every way. She is especially good when considering most grills from this franchise were never even worth that much. Too bad she ain't a main character. As a whole, the cast surely isn't among reasons to follow this masterpiece, but it's still kinda worth it for the papa swag factor and council of neko-eared harem girls disgusting about issues. It's truly fascinating to see how 5 fanservice figures and Kirito's \"daughter\" have meetings and make plans. \"We totally matter and can do things.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe more episodes there are, the more characters whose names I didn't even bother memorizing there are. That kind of amazing stuff going on here. I don't find mentioning anything about them to be worth of anyone's time, so I won't. Originally I planned also to write a section about the dialogue, but then I remembered I already said in the opening paragraph all that needs to be said about it. [Dreadful, pseudo-intellectual dialogue]. It also does amazing job making me not to like any characters because it is just that nauseating. \\n\\n\r\n[Production]\\n\\n\r\nNot the worst A-1 character design, but those CGI goblins are on another shitness level completely. The animation can be pretty rough and far from fluid. Cheap stuff, but also making me more confident that hiatus/split cours won't occur. The character movements are often awkward as well and again, CGI exists. From its color pallet and backdrops the thing also looks like other SAO series. The voice acting is meeting the same standards with earlier seasons as well. In terms of songs, big names in the making of OP and ED, as usual. BGM-wise, not much of it is present. Dialogue is the main thing that is being heard hear [fuck me, I know], occasionally some uber quiet \"menu music\" plays at the same time, or alternative terrible emotional song that convey feelings similarly as fart jokes deliver luls. Some based wobsie wob songs are present during action, but they surely could be better -- like everything else in the series... \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\\n\r\nI am glad I didn't choose a career as a timberman. I am not entirely sure why I am still watching this. I rarely drop anime series these days, but this one is definitely getting closer and closer of getting onto that list.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online franchise presents a new entry with its Alicization ark and doubles down on familiar writing disasters. With this season SAO reaches new storytelling lows and also seems to lose its last redeeming quality \u2013 action scenes. \r\nSCORE: 2 \u2013 Very Bad. \r\nSTORY: Boring exposition scenes interrupted by obligatory and meaningless fights. \r\nAt the beginning I was slightly confused, because SAO:A does not directly follow on its second season. This confusion lasted only a few episodes and worked as a setup for a new \u201cdeath simulation\u201d for Kirito, without his harem, but with the same amount of plot armor and OPnes. \r\nTerrible writingis more apparent in this season than anywhere else in the franchise. This show is too busy creating lengthy exposition dumps about either mundane or unnecessary topics: several episodes long discussion about calling and its meanings, that loses relevance after 1 sword swing; an entire episode to establish something as simple as basic royalty system; or 15 minutes of backstory for 2 characters, who lose within 10 seconds and vanish, just to name a few. As a result, plot progresses at a snail pace.\\n\r\nNot that the actual plot is any good. A lot of techno gibberish, plot holes and questionable motivations. Just a simple \u201csave the girl\u201d premise buried under a convoluted mess of pointless subplots. \\n\r\nAt least, people will stop talking about Asuna\u2019s horrible treatment in the first season, as SAO:A manages to top that scene. Genius. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Kirito - doubled; harem - disabled. \\n\r\nThere is Kirito and then there is lesser Kirito, who is just a slightly inferior version of the original. Support cast consists of crazy dudes and girls, predetermined assault victims or characters who die for nothing. There is really not much to talk about here. \\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION: One step forwards, two steps backwards. \\n\r\nWhile character models and backgrounds show more craftsmanship than the average anime show, SAO:A seems sterile und unimaginative, be it detailed but boring backgrounds or character designs. \\n\r\nThe biggest downgrade happened to action scenes. Sword fights turned into arm wrestling competition, where combatants just press glowing sticks against each other. Gone are the days of fluid sword dancing. Even the most potent fight against goblins in ep4 borrows too much from infamous directorial techniques like unnecessary camera movement or excessive close-ups, executed at 10 cuts per second. I certainly could not enjoy presented action.  \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The most anime sound possible. \\n\r\nThis is a MVP production, as Minimal Viable Product. Neither the music, nor the voice act stand out and will leave any memory. Maybe with the exception of this distorted sound on high energy impacts during fights.   \\n\\n\r\nDo not waste your time on this garbage. If you are looking for a competent \u201ctrapped in a video game world\u201d anime with a clear goal, superb world building, diplomacy, smart use of game mechanics and successful focus on NPCs, try Log Horizon.\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS. I advise any fans of this series to take this review with a grain of salt. I am here to criticize, and nothing more. Do not take this as an insult if you liked it. These are my opinions and my analysis of the series, nothing more.\r\nNow that we have that out of the way, let me make myself clear on my stance on this series, (if not already apparent by my score): This part of the anime is no different than the ones that preceded it. It has good art, but after that, I find it a complete travesty on thenarrative and cinematic level. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nScore: 7\\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, all things considered, is done very well, as expected of A-1 pictures. It is very vibrant, and the blood has a very nice tint to it. However, the same cannot be said for other visual aspects of this show. The character designs were alright, but Eugeo just look like an almost inverted color palette Kirito, and Alice looked like she was wearing rip-off Gilgamesh armor from the Fate series. Most of the other character designs were ok, but nothing special. The only thing I really liked character-design-wise was the Integrity knight armor, all of which looked pretty cool. The next part of criticism is leveled at the camera angles, which as part of a cinematic approach to the series, were horrendous. For all the confusing, boring, and downright lame dialogue this series rains on you, there is nothing to balance it. This series uses the pan shot to death, and it really left me yawning at everything I had to sit through. Literal 10+ minutes of boring dialogue trying to explain the mess of a narrative the plot was. This moves me onto my next point: the plot.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nThis has got to be one of the biggest ass-pulls I have ever witnessed in the medium. I will jump around because describing the plot in its entirety is pointless. To start off, let me just say that this is like the original SAO's plot, but far worse, even with a time skip to boot. So it really begins when Kirito is attacked by one of the people involved in the Death Gun murders from before and needs to go to a hospital, but for some reason is transferred to MILITARY-RUN ORGANIZATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA TO PLAY ANOTHER VIDEO GAME. He is transported to yet another MMORPG, and then is introduced to the other mains, and basically told he is going to rescue one of them that was taken away for some stupid reason. After that, I lost all hope of a cohesive and consistent story. Some of the more important parts of the story were just stupid. For instance, one time, Kirito is sent to jail. In the same episode, he escapes; even though he is literally in the most secure building in the area. At the end, while fighting the generically-bad-for-no-reason-overpowered-villain (who is also a woman in this game I might add), she is naked for 3 episodes. You couldn't even make the argument that she was \"asserting her dominance\", because if she were all-powerful, she could have just generated clothes for herself. It was actual tasteless fan service because she had to ability to do pretty much anything with the bounds of her power. The last thing I have to say is that the exposition dumps in this show were far worse than the last instances. I think it was about (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) 4-5 times. Anyway, the plot is all over the place, and also has a HARD over-reliance on the \"forgotten childhood friend\" trope that we all love so much. If you want to find out for yourself how bad the plot is, I implore you to go watch this trash.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nScore: 3\\n\r\nWeighted: 15%\\n\\n\r\nNow most of you would be like \"This is just a ploy to lower your score, isn't it?', and to that end, I would say this: WHY IS THE OST FROM THE LAST TWO STILL BEING USED???\\n\r\nSeriously, get a new composer or something, because the BGM in this show is tired as fuck. Aside from that, the first of OP just sounds like Crossing Field, but more boring. The other OP and EDs are slightly above average, but nothing irreplaceable to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 20%\\n\\n\r\nWhat more needs to be said here? The characters are just as horrible as ever (I'm only doing mains bc side characters are treated like shit). Let me start off with the biggest problem (as usual): Kirito. I feel like the writer has stretched this character out to the far ends of the galaxy. No, seriously, he has so many character traits, IT\u2019S UNCOUNTABLE. Kirito is flawless, and that's why I don't like him as a character. He has his cake, and devours it as well. He has a harem of girls, has stupid luck, can beat anyone at anything, and somehow manages to be a \"tragic\", \"flawed\", and \"understanding\" character. He never really suffers any consequence for HIS actions, just of those around him. It is because of this that he will never see proper character development. Anyway, as much as I'd LOVE to go on about how bad he is, plenty of people have already heard it, so I'll move on to Eugeo and Alice. As I stated earlier, this series has a over-reliance on the \"forgotten childhood friend\", and this time the plot decided to tie Kirito to these two in that way, even though he had literally never known them outside of the game. Eugo is a shy and humble boy, who soon joins with Kirito after the plot kicks in. After that, Eugeo doesn't really do much to drive the overall plot forward, and is just there to constantly remind Kirito what their goal is. Alice is the other character which Eugo aims to save along with Kirito. Within the bounds of the god-awful plot, when she conveniently loses her memory to become a bad-ass Integrity knight. I wish at least the second part were true, but she accomplished nothing, and ended up heavily relying on Kirito instead. There is also a sub-plot in which she wanted to get her memories back, but she never did due to how shallow the plot structure was. Speaking of shallow, how about we move onto another discount DIO Brando? The Pontifex is probably just as bad as Kirito because she is just a complete asshole. She is literally just discount DIO, but minus the immense and memorable flare DIO had. Anyway, the side characters (as also mentioned before) were all but forgotten about, and hardly influenced the main's action. The most any side character contributed was when two of them were being (you guessed it): RAPED.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nScore: 1 \\n\r\nWeighted: 35%\\n\\n\r\nI felt massive disdain after completing this, because of the fuck-all way it was ended. A stupid cliff-hanger no doubt. Anyway, In my opinion, all of this was way too fucking long. This could have been done in 12 episodes. In essence, it just felt cheap.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7*.15) + (1*.15) + (3*.15) + ( 1*.20) + (1*.35) = 2.2\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to complain about my criticisms, I ask you this: Is it really worth both of our time? Or can you just accept my opinion as it is and move on? Anyway, I might add that this is my first review, so sorry if my writing was shaky. Thank you for reading!",

            "content": "So I decided to torture myself by watching another season of SAO, after being so disappointed that i dropped the second season halfway in (the end of the GGO arc), but I'm glad to say that this season exceeded my expectations.\r\nThe story has improved significantly and has an added element of mystery that is actually compelling. My only complaints being that there is quite a bit of exposition that could be done in a more interesting way and the second one being a bit with the direction that there may be occasions where the imagery may be slightly unrelated to the dialogue and a lotof visual focus may fall on insignificant details, but it's much better than in the previous seasons (that's me nitpicking a bit, but that's usually kinda what separates masterpieces from other works).\\n\r\nThe artwork is great, the artstyle is nice and polished and the occasional use of cgi only adds to the visual effects and it's used smartly to add more tension to fight scenes and overcome the limitations of 2D animation.\\n\r\nAnother thing I'm happy that Kirito's character stopped being the center of the universe and has stepped back a bit (SPOILER ALERT) has taken a bit the role of a mentor and a guiding figure(END OF SPOILER). Overall his character has much more dimension showing that the writing has improved. THE KIRITO FANCLUB has finally more personality beyond just \"OH MY GOD KIRITO IS SO COOL!!!1!\" and it's established in just a few scenes.\\n\r\nAlso praise whoever decided to tone down the fanservice to just 1 second of an awkward position in 1 episode out of 4.\\n\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying it and i really hope it doesn't go downhill from here, cause it's going in a good direction",

            "content": "As someone who is coming in attached to Sword Art Online because of the Aincrad Arc, who was let down by the Fairy Tale Arc, who felt GGO and the rest of SAO II was satisfactory, Alicization has done nothing but exceed my expectations. From the start, the world that was created around Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice was one that had me mesmerized. This was the world building that I saw glimpses of in the Aincrad arc, that I wish I had seen more of. From the details of the cove, to how the town looked, I was instantly drawn to this world. Although itmight have seemed kind of filler to individuals, the second half of the first episode, I can assure you, is integral to much later on in the story. Additionally, I understand that many people had problems with the cut-down time lapse of Kirito and Eugeo making their way to the capital, but honestly, plot-wise, this was easily the best choice for them to cut down budget wise. Additionally, say what you will, I believe that Episode 10 was built up to incredibly well from the previous episodes. The two minor antagonists, were essentially built around the character development of the world itself; they were individuals who used the Taboo Index to their advantage in order to carry out their ill desires, their human desires. I believe that the scene (I won't explain in detail) was extremely graphic, but in a way that was critical to the plot unlike Sugou and the Fairy Tale arc. I believe that the producers did an amazing job in truly building up the suspense and violence in such a scene, and that this scene was critical in furthering the plot development regarding Fluctlight behaviour. I would say that scene was more powerful than anything I've watched previously, and as someone who's seen shows like Goblin Slayer, trust me, this scene is messed up. Nonetheless, I believe it was executed extremely well by the show producers, and I can only look forward to see what's coming in store. Additionally, I believe the art animation, although choppy in some areas, is that fantasy vibe that captures Alicization well. You want the epic sword fights that you signed up for from the Aincrad arc? You'll get plenty of it. You want to hear the best soundtracks from the previous seasons come out remade, with a whole added kick? Done. You want to see Kirito start anew in a world where he isn't totally broken, and has to actually learn how to use the system and develop like a normal protagonist would? It's done. Sick of harem and fanservice? It's cut down immensely in this season. You want actual side characters that are constantly developed and not just shadows in the background? Eugeo, and later Alice are clear cut examples of that. Paying attention to every detail in the show rewards the viewer well, and it'll only continue to do so in the future episodes. I'm excited to see what the best arc of Sword Art Online has to bring, and I believe that this arc has redeemed the series from what has been an abysmal past season. If you liked the Aincrad Arc, and put up with everything after, you'll be rewarded for your loyalty to this series with Alicization. A 52 episode season isn't something that we get often in this day and age, and from the looks of the first 10 episodes, I can't help but get excited for the episodes to come.",

            "content": "As a TL;DR, if you absolutely hate SAO, you're still probably going to hate this. Its improved but still has some of it's issues.\r\nIf you think parts of SAO were good and others (*cough* ALO) were bad, this season is as good or better than the Aincrad arc. \r\nThe story and premise for this season were overall very interesting and helped build an incredibly interesting situation. I have a few issues with the story (mainly the IRL portion), but overall its 8/10, pretty good. As a light novel reader, I understand the anime had to gloss over some things, but overall I think they arekeeping a good balance of plot development and speed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound, and animation are 10/10 as always with A1 Pictures. This anime is beautiful and well made. \\n\\n\r\nNow as to why this particular season is arguably the strongest in SAO. Simply put, it has a lot more content and many characters that even Kirito has to respect. Things are darker, there's blood and gore. There's also many characters that are incredibly influential. As always, characters are rather static but some of them do change and grow; they're important. \\n\\n\r\nThat can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. This arc is based off of roughly 10 light novels as opposed to the usual 2. Not every single episode is filled to the brim with action; there's dialogue and character development.  Rest assured though, there are plenty of epic fights in this show, especially in the upcoming episodes. People will complain that its too fast or too slow, just know that it has a lot to cover and that there are fast and slow parts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, As a LN reader so far I'm loving this season. There's plenty or things to look forward to and what's already there is very well executed. If you absolutely hate SAO this probably won't change your mind, but its a good story with fun to watch fights and a plot that explores what its like to be human; definitely an improvement from previous arcs. I'm slightly biased as this is the only series I can stand reading ahead, but I highly suggest you watch this.",

            "content": "\"Watch Alicization, it's SO much better\"\r\nBecause it is. Because normal people don't cling to their hate of a series and use everything it did wrong in the past as a reason to hate it in the present.\r\nNormal people won't go on about how \"SAO's biggest problem is itself,\" or try their damn hardest to try to prove how Reki fails as a writer because of what he's done in the past. They don't compare every little flaw in Alicization to what SAO was in the past because THIS ISN'T THE PAST. Alicization isn't perfect, it has its flaws, but rating this series a 1, 3,hell even 5? No, Alicization is in almost every possible way lightyears ahead of the past seasons, and even the movie (which I enjoyed significantly more than either other season just fyi)\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers for any of the 3 people reading this who haven't already watched Alicization; of pretty much the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\n\"Boring infodumps\"\\n\r\nPretty much the biggest problem of Alicization as a whole. If it wasn't bad enough in ufotable's adaptation of UBW, Alicization is loaded to the brim with pausing in the middle of battles to make time seemingly stop in order to express dialogue that I can only imagine was a lot better in the original light novels.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my biggest flaw with Alicization, yes. I won't deny that. But here's where I offer pushback as my reason for bringing this up first: THIS WASN'T AN ISSUE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.\\n\\n\r\nI don't understand what the issue is with so many people having problems with how Alicization decided to set the scene. It was a completely new setting in every way; the only relative similarity between it and past seasons of SAO is the fact that it's not a part of the real-world. Though, in a lot of ways, it might as well have been.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't me trying to tout moderate improvement to past seasons either, as something that's a little better than complete crap is still crap... this is more me saying that bad exposition turned into slightly above-average exposition. I had a lot of fun watching how Alicization started off and I got tons of great vibes from both the writer(s) and the general direction of how everything was handled. Kirito isn't just being thrown into this world nonsensically to kickstart a completely new story with the \"Sword Art Online\" branding that stars someone as famous as \"Kirito,\" this is the SAO world in a completely new light.\\n\\n\r\n\"Time skips\"\\n\r\nThis is about one of the most laughable complaints I've ever heard for any anime, hell any piece of media as far as I can remember. People really wanna try to compare the two-year time skip of Aincrad to the two-year time skip of Alicization. Alright, let me explain something very simple that's literally nothing more than basic understanding of the material you're writing about (ironically the people who don't have this probably shouldn't even be writing reviews in the first place) -\\n\\n\r\nAincrad: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, including (but not limited to) the overarching plot and setting, the introduction of cool characters, and the feeling of \"growing pains\" that surrounds all of these things, there was the decision to have an extended time skip pretty much RIGHT to the end. Aincrad's biggest issue is that it skipped past all the cool stuff that everyone would've not only loved to see, but even NEEDED to see to be able to comprehend why everything that happened happened.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization: Amidst a plethora of extremely interesting plot points, almost all within the same parameters of Aincrad right before its infamous time skip, there was the decision to have an extended time skip right to the \"meat and potatoes\" part of the season. Alicization's biggest strongpoint is that it skipped past all the boring stuff that nobody would've enjoyed seeing, essentially saving everyone a bunch of time by quickly filling in what would've otherwise been a bunch of boring filler. God bless the team behind Alicization for not milking SAO out to be a generic battle shonen with 50+ straight episodes of filler, and instead cutting to the chase and saying \"ok, so this is what we did. And then we trained and grew for 2 years and now we're here. Now let's get to the good stuff.\"\\n\\n\r\nPutting it frankly, Aincrad skipped over the good stuff and Alicization skipped over the bad stuff. Remember, just because something is a horrible writing decision in one scenario doesn't mean it's going to be just as bad in what is literally the EXACT OPPOSITE of the same scenario.\\n\\n\r\n\"It didn't have enough _____\"\\n\r\nTo fill in the blank, the most common terms other reviewers have used have been \"world-building,\" \"definition,\" \"focus,\" and other terms people have thrown around.\\n\\n\r\nTo a certain point I can agree, but to the most basic of points I cannot.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with world-building. Common complaints you'll hear essentially say that \"because Alicization isn't an ACTUAL open-world MMO it fails at world building.\" Except... how many anime have you seen really nail world building to the level that it would be sufficient in an MMO scenario? It just doesn't happen, because anime is a different medium to an actual MMO. Even top-tier world building, like what you'd find in something like FMAB, wouldn't compare to an actual lore-rich MMO.\\n\\n\r\nKirito, Eugeo, and Alice grow up in one town, and the main goal of that town is specifically the tree Eugeo has to cut down. So why exactly does every little village need to be covered? Then they move onto a more upper-class city because they're trying to become nobles. So why does everything need to be covered there? And then they move onto the cathedral, where it's made very clear that they only fight against knights on very specific floors. So why does every floor need to be covered?\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people think that because an anime is based inside of what is otherwise an MMORPG that it needs to have the same caliber of world-building as one. However, this isn't World of Warcraft. This is SAO, an anime series. And personally, I think the quicker that you begin to realize that, the more you'll end up enjoying Alicization as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a 24-episode anime series, so not every single town, camp, NPC, and even table can have the same huge backstory that those respective things would in an actual MMORPG. Of course this isn't me saying the world-building of Alicization is absolutely amazing either, I'm just saying it does its job. Not every anime needs to have world-building as good as FMAB to be sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nNow for definition. I don't have a lot to say about this because I actually agree with people saying Alicization isn't extremely well-defined. Personally, I think it does its job well, but it definitely isn't perfect, hell I'd probably not even say its good; just a bit above average, really.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue Alicization has with its overall definition and polish is the simple fact that it will fall really flat in being overly cohesive as an anime. It tells a lot more than it shows sometimes, which is something I will forever consider a flaw in a visual medium. But as I said, I don't have a ton to say because I don't think it's as good as the fanboys say or as bad as the haters say. It's average, maybe just a bit above it.\\n\\n\r\nBut man, focus. This is where I have a bone to pick with certain individuals.\\n\\n\r\nI will agree fully with the fact that certain things DID deserve more focus than they got, particularly around Eugeo's backstory and the fact that a lot of things went completely ignored. It really does bother me that the issues he (apparently) had with his family went completely ignored, and how he suddenly remembered that it wasn't just him and Alice together as children, but Kirito as well... except, he just conveniently forgot what happened during the 6 years that they weren't together (between when Alice disappeared and when Kirito spawned back into the underworld at his real-world age). I wanna know more about this kind of stuff, and the fact that these things weren't really covered does bother me quite a bit, and definitely worked towards impacting the story in a negative way.\\n\\n\r\nBut, just because the story had a few glaring issues suddenly means that EVERYTHING it did was wrong? No way.\\n\\n\r\nSee, even though I said earlier that Alicization isn't an MMO, there's still the blatant fact that it's definitely ABOUT an MMO. Of course something about an MMO that takes place in an MMO is going to have MMO characteristics, just like how it DID have an overarching world and the world was built around the plot despite not being built to the level you'd expect from a traditional MMO. To say that Alicization lost focus by putting too much attention on \"unimportant matters\" is just foolish.\\n\\n\r\nFluctlights are important. As are sword skills, and how they happen. As is the villain and what they're gonna do, the same way you would talk about taking on a boss in an MMO. Remember, this isn't just purely a simulation/video game, but that it also isn't JUST a battle of humanity challenging a greater evil. It's both.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start rambling, let's wrap up this \"reviewer rant\" section with a few other points before getting into MY review.\\n\\n\r\n1. Alicization intentionally doesn't always take itself seriously. Much like many fans of comedy (both in and out of anime) understand very clearly, even the most serious things can have comedic breaks without seeming out of character. Alicization does the same thing except with both comedy and absurdity. It likes to be fun, and if it doesn't always take itself too seriously, you shouldn't either. Just have fun, you'll enjoy it a lot more.\\n\\n\r\n2. The actual content of the plot is different from past seasons of SAO solely because things have a reason for happening. Nitpicking every little issue from the plot doesn't necessarily take away the real substance of it and what makes it great, which is something I don't see enough reviewers talking about (and it honestly bothers the hell out of me). They talk about the flaws in a way that creates a two-page wall of text, and then end it with \"and this is why it sucks.\" That's only part of it, though; be fair and respectful towards the creators and talk about BOTH parts.\\n\\n\r\n3. I'll go deeper into this later, but I want people to understand that the \"casuals will be casuals\" argument is about the dumbest thing any person can genuinely use against Alicization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for my own words that aren't at all intended to be used directly against anyone else's.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was the main grabber that made me realize that the general story of Alicization was different from past seasons of SAO? If I had to pin down one exact thing, it would be everything that happens happens for a well-defined reason.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't just the time skip, insane plot armor (Jesus-kun), and nonsensical BS that ruined Aincrad (and the entire first and most of the second season as a whole). What it was was that even an outstanding majority of the sections that were complete and coherent had no real reason to be happening.\\n\\n\r\nKirito meets a girl and she dies. Waste of an episode. Three episodes of watching him and the female lead screw around. Waste of three episodes. Cut away to a period of time where they spent 3 episodes getting a sword to make Kirito even more overpowered and then some random girl is sick and we're supposed to care about her. Waste of literally half a season.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization not only improves on this array of crap, but handles it in ways that aren't hard to get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to introducing an interesting character and immediately forgetting about them for the rest of the series, Alicization introduces multiple interesting characters that fully fulfill their role in the series. When something happens, it makes sense why it happens and it's typically very enjoyable. The long-term static growth of these characters often happens off-screen, but the main kicker is the fact that when there's a significant amount of growth in a short amount of time, we see it and are able to understand fully why it's happening, and it always makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe time that's wasted in Alicization isn't wasted with events that make no sense, because everything makes sense and there's always a good reason for it. The issues each character faced were clearly cut out and made sense, and were enjoyable to watch, even if some of them ended up being dumb, mindless fun without much real substance.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the controversial way of handling a topic as sensitive as sexual abuse, there was never a time where it felt overly edgy or at all like fetishizing the subject, instead the themes were mature and the audience was respected throughout the exploration of the subject.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization doesn't do a lot to question the way people think or how you do things; it isn't psychological or philosophical. Instead, you have this action series that handles itself like an action series, staying true to itself throughout the entire thing, start to finish, doing everything in a way that makes sense and is enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf my discussion of the story sounded at all basic, open-ended in a bad way, or generally stretched out without much substance, that's because it was. The story of Alicization was the worst part of it, it was a pretty good story that wasn't great, and most of the reason I liked it came down to personal enjoyment of action anime and the fact that it was coherent enough to get by. As I mentioned earlier, not everything NEEDS to be taken super seriously, and it's a lot easier to enjoy things that aren't perfect (or in this case, great) when you decide to just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that the story of Alicization was bad, though. Just not amazing. Still pretty good. Flawed. Not perfect, but definitely above-average.\\n\\n\r\nBut the characters... this was definitely the biggest improvement to past seasons of SAO.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization completely obliterates every past season of SAO in the character department for 3 main reasons:\\n\\n\r\n1. General character layout\\n\r\n2. Number of characters\\n\r\n3. Purpose of characters\\n\\n\r\nLet's dive deeper.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by \"general character layout\" is the fact that Kirito, beyond the first episode, understands fully well that he's in a virtual world and that none of these people are real. This is a huge deal because of how characters have been handled in past seasons; Kirito understood that all the people in SAO, ALO, and GGO were real, living human beings.\\n\\n\r\nIt's different, but why is it important? Fantastic question. Because it allows Kirito to question the decisions he makes.\\n\r\nAside from how the season ends, the idea that sits in the back of Kirito's brain throughout the entire season is that the world is virtual and nothing huge is lost if he doesn't complete his mission. Despite that, he still draws huge ties to the individuals he meets and fights as hard as he possibly can to ensure that the mission is eventually completed.\\n\r\nI consider this extremely important for one reason: Kirito was once the most basic anime protagonist to ever exist. Now, he has layers and it's a lot easier to relate to him on a personal level, beyond that of a basic \"haha I like video games too Kirito is a cool anime character.\" Hell, there may even be times where you'll forget that this is the same Kirito from the last two seasons; god knows I felt that way a few times.\\n\\n\r\nNumber of characters is a lot more important than many will realize; there really isn't an actual \"wasted\" character here.\\n\r\nIf you learn as little as the name of any character, you'll be quick to understand that they're probably gonna be important to the plot, and 100% of the time that ends up being the case. This contradicts from past seasons of SAO purely because you had characters like Klein, Liz, Silica, Suguha, and Agil that had no actual meaning to the plot... and if you're like me, you understand that that was a MAJORITY of the \"primary\" characters in the first 2 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization takes a different, FAR superior approach, to the characters; everybody means something to the plot, and the ones who don't are just simply left as non-characters who aren't even properly introduced. A lot of ways this is proven are by things like characters being introduced early-on and having an important role later on, characters being or not being introduced by name quickly after their first on-screen appearance, or characters doing something for the plot early on. The amount of organization that comes from something as simple as NOT creating a character unless they have a reason to exist increases the overall quality of the season significantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe purpose of characters is quite possibly the most important thing here, but the thing that requires the least explaining just because of how obvious it is and how much better it makes things.\\n\\n\r\nLet me give you a quick example. Sinon was a female lead many considered badass because she wasn't a Mary Sue like Asuna, and actually had some definition and substance whereas Asuna didn't. The problem was, despite Sinon's positive attributes, she still became part of Kirito's harem.\\n\r\nAlice is similar; she's by far the best female lead in SAO history (even if she is basically just a thought until halfway through the season), and has tons of definition even compared to Sinon. But... she doesn't become part of Kirito's harem, instead she remains mostly independent in personality and thought.\\n\\n\r\nThis didn't just apply to Alice, either. Eugeo wasn't Klein; a quick sidekick abandoned after two epiodes. His existence was just as important as Kirito's, something that couldn't be said about any other character in either of the past seasons besides Asuna's in Mother's Rosario.\\n\r\nSelka didn't just sit as lolibait to make people feel like they had their own \"imouto-chan\" to love and cherish, she actually sat as positive progression of Alice's character later on. Complete 180 compared to Suguha.\\n\r\nRonie and Tiese weren't just random waifus to add to Kirito's harem like Silica and Liz, they were essential parts to progressing the story of Kirito and Eugeo, essentially the reason their journey of saving Alice truly began in the first place.\\n\r\nEtc, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to ignore how in SO many ways Alicization just takes the parts that made past seasons of SAO complete crap and makes them great. This isn't just polishing a turd, this is completely restructuring the turd and turning it into pure gold. Again, more reviewers need to talk about this kind of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I can brush over quickly, before wrapping everything up: the art and sound of Alicization was near perfection.\\n\\n\r\nWhile you will get the ufotable UBW vibes of \"let's slow down/pause the battle to add in dialogue\" pretty often throughout Alicization, what you'll also get is the artistic fidelity of ufotable UBW, or at least damn close. The art is beautiful; the still scenes are absolutely gorgeous, the environments are a treat to look at, and the quality of the battles are nothing I'd consider any less than majestic. The art and animation of Alicization are not up for debate; they're amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound does the same thing, just to me perhaps a little better. As a die-hard Yuki Kajiura fanboy, it's quite easy for me to enjoy every little detail of the music here, to the point where even tracks that I felt like I'd heard too much in the prior 2 seasons felt really great (and slightly nostalgic) when mixed into Alicization; if anything, they felt a lot more at-home here than in the past. Of course, all of the new music was incredible down to the finest detail as well, including both opening/ending themes. And like with all Japanese dubs, the voice acting was also nothing less than superb.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's wrap everything up into a nice little package.\\n\\n\r\nHaters gonna hate, and I don't say that in a preppy teenager way either. I mean it.\\n\r\nIf every reference to SAO were pulled from Alicization and it were otherwise the exact same thing rebranded into something new, the top 3 reviews wouldn't be negative and the series would absolutely, no question about it, sit a lot closer to an 8.2-8.3 in overall average rating.\\n\\n\r\nThis is SAO, and with how bad the first two seasons were (ESPECIALLY the first), people can't handle SAO being good for once. Because of that single bias against something that's nothing more than a label, the haters will drag every little flaw it has through the dirt until they can make it look so bad that nobody will even be willing to talk about the plethora of things it does insanely well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a crappy season that only casuals praise. Far from it. Anyone saying, thinking, or believing that \"casuals will be casuals\" and that \"watch Alicization, it's SO much better\" is the battle cry of casuals in denial are just foolish. The casuals that made SAO as popular as it is in the first place only existed initially, and since its first year or so of post-airing existence, the series has been considerably dragged through the dirt more and more to the point where there's so few new SAO fans appearing out of thin air these days. The casuals who made the series popular literally 5-6 years ago went from being edgy middle schoolers to now being working, bill-paying adults who likely wouldn't praise the series \"just because it's SAO.\" These are individuals with taste who likely dislike the first two seasons of SAO just as much as you, and only praise Alicization BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, in the end, that's what it all comes down to. People praise Alicization because it's good. They praise it because it does things right. They praise it because instead of the abundance of meaningless \"primary\" characters, there's significantly less characters and all of them have meaning. They praise it because the bland, 2D cardboard cutout protagonist is no longer Jesus-kun, and is now fully a respectable protagonist somewhat worthy of his popularity (though as a whole still quite overrated). They praise it because sometimes you'll even forget Kirito is the same protagonist of the prior 2 crap seasons, just because he's that much different, and when you ARE reminded that he's the same person, it's for a good reason; he flaunts his unique duel-wielding style or he starts wearing his Aincrad clothing without being absurdly overpowered.\\n\\n\r\nAlicization has flaws, but they're not the crazy things that so many people consider comparable to the flaws of the first two seasons. Instead, Alicization fixes most of them by creating its own thing that ends up being great due to careful planning and quality writing.\\n\\n\r\nI'm excited for season 2, and for once in my life, I'm starting to think I may have an overall positive view of SAO. Thanks for reading and have a great day!",

            "content": "This Sword Art Online name is no stranger to our ears, starting from video games and even animation. SAO itself now has two franchises, namely SAO produced by A1-pictures / original and \"Gun Gale Online\" produced by studio 3hz. After six The year since the first release of the anime this series has taken many people's attention not only in Japan but throughout the world and their popularity can be said to be the same as Naruto or One Piece. The fifth project from A1-Pictures studio adapted the advanced chapter \"Alicization\" in all chapters Online sword art such as progressive and others, this is thelongest of all the chapters and from the news I heard the alicization series was appointed as an anime which will have 52 episodes / at least 4 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nTells about Kirigaya Kazuto he is a hero who stopped Sword Art Online game which is a deadly game made by Kayaba Akihiko, after completing the SAO game Kirito lived his life casually he was also with his lover Asuna who was saved by him. But that happiness was not always Kirito to meet a former member of Player Killer from Sword Art Online he wanted to avenge the death of those who were in the player killer organization by killing Kirito, but Kirito was saved but he had to struggle to maintain the performance of his brain by entering the \"Alicization\" program designed by the STL company there Kirito became a village person who had two friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline in this series is very long and moves very slowly, it makes some viewers bored with some very predictable clip-parts, in the first episode they are very good at packing several clips into a story that can be said to be a masterpiece but not always it happens right in the middle they lost it all.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Budget Works is not just a name for ufotable studios. A1-pictures are also not inferior to ufotable studios, they crossed the line within themselves to devote all their abilities to this project and the results they could compete with very stunning graphic designs. Their CGI but A1-pictures can match them, regardless of how much money they use to make this series, which is clearly not a small amount of money left in this series, there are some CGI effects that we rarely encounter in other series and I'm sure they are working very hard to For the design of the characters I gave a negative value to this series, basically they designed the same characters by changing a number of looks like their colors and hairstyles to create new characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of their voice that is very good seen from the quality of their voices in stark contrast to the characters they play to match it they must adjust the character they want to play especially the voice actor / seiyuu must fit in the role of character age, age is an important right in quality the voice of the voice must be made as closely as possible to the age of the character they are playing like Kirito who is seventeen years old while the age of the voice actor himself is not like that especially the voice actor also acts as another character in other series as well. This series has at least 4 seasons which means has four different opening and closing themes, the first theme \"Adamaz\" which was performed by LiSA was very good as always she was very passionate in singing high-pitched songs, in this series we came to the two voices we will discuss later.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nIn this series we have two new characters, Eugeo and Alice, they are childhood friends of Kirito in the world who are being developed by the STL company. For the voices themselves the studio has been thinking carefully about this which was designated to fill the voice of Eugeo's character and Alice is Shimazaki Nobunaga and Kayano Ai. I rarely hear Shinmazaki Nobunaga's name so I will jump to discuss this one voice, but for Kayano Ai you must have heard her voice in some interesting anime series from Kayano Ai that she can adjust the sound quota with The characters they will play. Back in the discussion of characters in this series who played protagonists are still the same, namely Kirito and Asuna, while for playing antagonists it has not been shown but for the time being I assume that the one who set up the \"integrity knight\" is an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of manga and novels I really like the adaptation of the Sword Art Online series. They are very solid in adapting this series. The presentation of the action scenes they offer is very cool and full of surprises too. After the release of ordinal scale films I thought they had stopped to adapt the Sword Art Online series. because they have made a lot of profits in this business, but after I got the news that A1-pictures will adapt the advanced series Sword Art Online, which is alicization. For the continuation of this series, it is still in the working stage, hopefully in the future they can improve their performance in adapting this series.",

            "content": "First first off, this is like the third time I am posting this because \"I didn't watch enough episodes before.\"\r\nOkay, so first off, let me tell you that I have been an SAO fan for a while, as it will always have a social place in my heart, so if you take my review with a grain of salt that's fine.\r\nSTORY - 9\r\nSo far, the plot looks enticing, and with A-1 Pictures giving SAO Alicization 4 cours instead of 1 or 2, I don't suspect nearly as many plot jumps to happen as there were in SAO season 1. The working principles of the newVR device, the Soul Translator (was in the trailer, not a spoiler), do open up a lot of potholes, however, but so did the concept of the Nervegear. I mean, microwaves?! As we are now 10 episodes in, I see that the story is flowing very nicely, and everything feels well-paced. Episode 10 was a shocker, and it's bumped my story grade up to 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the entirety of the SAO series as well as other animations by A-1 is always very good. Originally, I thought A-1 could only hold the first episode's animation quality for one or two episodes, but boy, was I wrong. This season is rivaling even Ordinal Scale's quality! On a WEEKLY basis, mind you! Maybe they can keep this up for a year (or longer, if the cours are split), and maybe they can't, but even still, I don't expect anything to look worse than an 8/10 by the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nLikewise with the animations, the music in SAO is top notch. Somewhere in the middle of the first episode, it did sound kind of funny when Kirito waved his photon sword in front of the camera (almost like a fart, maybe it's just me), but other than that, I didn't notice any anomalies. As for the soundtrack, it does not disappoint, and fits relatively well with the scenes shown, even if a lot of the soundtrack is reused from previous seasons. After episode one, the soundtrack has been staying solid as well, and so have the sound effects. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so to a lot of people, the characters were the worst point of SAO, so I will try and be impartial here. During the first episode, I did not know which characters would get more time in the spotlight, but it still seemed as though Kirito was OP as always in VR, and Asuna was all over him. No, seriously. I nearly died laughing when she showed Sinon the thing about the heartrate, mainly because of her expression at that point. Bit creepy, but the reasoning behind it is cute, I guess. After three more episodes, I can already tell this will top even the Aincrad arc. For one, Kirito is not unbearably OP, and we get to see his struggles. To not spoil anything, I will just tell you to watch the series yourself. As of episode 10, I can say that characters are developing well, and everything is going great! Antagonists are EXTREMELY hate-able!\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, SAO has always had a special place in my heart, and the first ten episodes have not changed that. If they have, they have made me like it even more! This season is sure to be great, and these first ten episodes (the first one being 47 minutes) definitely did not disappoint. I found myself waiting every week, wanting to know what would happen next. Even if you dislike SAO, I am literally urging you to try this new season out to, at the very least, neutralize negative feelings towards it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Definitely worth a watch, even if you are not an SAO fan. If you have not watched the previous seasons, you will definitely be lost for some parts, so watch them first.",

            "content": "This is by FAR the best SAO season to date.\r\nThis new SAO finally brings new characters who aren't extremely bland, evil, annoying, redundant, and/or useless. We are finally greeted with kirito's new virtual world and faces new challenges that of course include saving someone from a higher power as we've seen countless times. The difference is that this higher power finally is genuinely interesting and the notion of their existence brings up much higher level intellectual subjects such as societal evolution and the theory of knowledge. This new experiment that is being done in the anime is extremely interesting for any computer science and/or philosophystudent and definitely get a 8/10 for the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound are typical of any other SAO season and gets a 9/10 and 9/10 respectively. The new fantasy world is well drawn and vibrant, and sounds are just right in the OP and END.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter and Enjoyment get and 7/10 and 9/10 respectively. The new characters have finally pumped fresh blood into this series, and most of them are fine/good. However, the old and redundant characters are still taking a backseat in what seems like a feline meeting that happens every 1 or 2 episodes. This new SAO is as enjoyable as the good episodes of the first season, it drifts from its old concepts of the VRMMO world which refreshes the entire show well in my perspective.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, SAO: Alicization gets an 8.5/10, would recommend to all of the SAO and MMO fans, also does well for tech fans too.",

            "content": "LISTEN, MAYBE IT'S AN UNPOPULAR OPINION, BUT THIS SEASON IS THE BEST SEASON OF SAO TO DATE.\r\nI get it, people don't like it, but I'm gonna take a minute to explain why I loved it oh so much. Number one: the sound design and art are absolutely gorgeous. I think the storyline for this season gave a lot of opportunity for beautiful art, and this season didn't disappoint. I think I have a thing with lighting effects because every time I see an anime with stunning lighting, I have to bring it up. See: SAO. The sound, also, especially during the last half of thisseason, was so lovely and emotional.\\n\\n\r\nThe story. Okay, so I'm assuming this where everyone's hang-ups lie, right? Let me tell you why you may not like this season: it isn't all about Kirito and Asuna anymore. In fact, the main clique from SAO doesn't show up much in this season. It's VERY different compared to the seasons prior. \\n\\n\r\nThat, however, is why I loved it. I felt like SAO needed a revamp after the second season, and I think this season proved to me how much better the series could be. The story itself was imminently intriguing. The world that was created for Alice and Eugeo (the world Kirito finds himself in this season) is something that I fell for immediately; in fact, I'd love to see an entire anime just about those three in that world rather than just a season. To me, at least, the story change was very well written because the dynamic it reigned in was something completely unlike anything we've seen before. There is a bit of a time jump in the middle that's a bit weird, but for the most part, the pacing is done really well to explain how these characters get from point A to point B. It doesn't feel like anything's missing. \\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna know the main reason I fell in love with this season, though (even though the story was fresh and interesting), it was the characters. The new additions to the cast made this season for me. Especially Eugeo. Because this world is so different, Eugeo came off as a very unique character, and I liked that. The development he went through was some of the most interesting I've seen because of how it was written. You got to see all colors, and that's something I was surprised to see given the fact that he isn't a main member of the overall SAO cast. He become beloved very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that, though, I think getting to see Kirito connect this much with someone new (Eugeo) was really valuable for the series. I'm glad that that was written in and shown because it offered some movement and development for Kirito as a character that we haven't gotten in a long time. The previous seasons ended up flat-lining because it felt like repeated material after a while, so that's why I think this season is so special; it shook everything up. It made me get invested in SAO again. Even the parts that don't involved Eugeo and Alice. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I think I'm most excited for going forward is seeing how this has changed Kirito and what all of this means in the real world. Also if anything will connect together in the future. I don't feel like I did a whole lot of explaining during this review, but I will say this: Sword Art Online: Alicization is one of the best things I've seen in anime.",

            "content": "I scrolled through some of the reviews on this and I say 10s, plural, this show is not very good. As you can see from, my score I didn't love this season, my emotions ranged from excitement (surprisingly), to boredom, to hate. Mainly boredom though. \r\nThe show starts off  ambiguously with us straight in the game world, the art and animation look great, the fantasy ambient music is playing in the back. It makes the first initial seconds feel really atmospheric. Your introduced to the first two main character as kids, within the first 3 minutes they come off as really endearing and loveable.I really can't give enough praise for the first episode or at least it's first half. The first episode is 40 mins long with the first part taking place in game and the second outside. If you've ever played Assassins Creed, you'll get a similar feeling when watching this. I love the in game world. I hate everything outside.\\n\\n\r\nThe outside world doesn't play as significant  a part as the initial episodes might lead you think. The main problem with them is it's just boring there's no real progression of the story everything outside of the in game world serves as a prelude to the events in game or as exposition neither serve to further the plot. Episode 5 and 6 are especially guilty of this. What are they? Two episodes of straight exposition, it so boring, I don't know who thought it was a good idea to do this. It took me 5 sittings to watch these two episodes, two of which I fell asleep in. That tbh is the main problem with this it sort of disguises itself with the high production quality of its earlier episode but is mediocre. Nothing really happens past episode 12, Kirito and Eugeo enter a tower where they fight for 5 mins and listen to exposition for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nBy far what cemented this show as mediocre in my mind though was the ending,ignoring the garbage cliffhanger and setup for a a sequel, the whole situation that leads up to that makes no sense. The antagonist has no meaningful  characterisation whatsoever, she's evil because she wants power or somehing like that. The whole final battle  before the final battle and the final battle itself make no sense. It's really badly choreographed, it's just the same fight scene you see in every other action anime with a respectable budget. Things just sort of happen and if your looking, not watching or are maybe younger in age this might appease you but if that does not apply to you then like me you might just be like, wtf. You would be right as well because none of this is explained, it just happens.\\n\\n\r\nThere's so much more that's wrong, Kiritos lack of characterization, the lack of interesting characters with this but I'm tired of typing. This show went from being really exciting  for what I'd hoped to be a good season of a show that I was fond of in my childhood but just turned out to be boring. Really boring.",

            "content": "Reki Kawahara's...Magnum Opus???\r\nSword Art Online: Alicization gives us another installment of Kirito and the gang but this time Kirito wakes up in a game world like no other. No Asuna, No sword, new world.\r\nIf there was a weakest link in Sword Art Online...ironically enough was Kirito but in Sword Art Online: Alicization he FINALLY gets his due and develops, instead of the being Hacking OP Game Jesus he's known for.\r\nOk, so it seems Reki Kawahara has gone back to his roots with Sword Art Online: Alicization and looked back into his flaws of the Aincrad arc and saw it's immense flaws and decided to giveKirito a fighting chance of him actually developing as a character, fleshing out his new game world and what it means to Kirito and his new companion Eugeo voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki. With how Sword Art Online: Alicization was formatted and planned out, the anime really takes it's time with it's pacing being for the most part, moderately slow, slowly drip feeding up exposition about the game world and giving us enough information to us to to speed to the world Kirito is in and to be honest with how the first few episodes introduced everything, LA and the audience would had been easily in the dark, so the exposition at the start is necessary.\\n\\n\r\nWith the world building, well since Kirito knows this new game world of Underworld is a game world, he exploits basic features and weirdly enough he has admin privileges (but not to worry he doesn't outright abuse it) let alone the fact that allies and villains use it just as well as he does, so it's even footing either way. The world building through Sword Art Online: Alicization was actually VERY well done, giving us a Chehov's gun payoff that gets mentioned and utilized well throughout the anime, almost like LA is watching someone playing an MMO game in a ways. Of course latter down the line, exposition does somewhat become a problem with episodes dedicated to certain characters backstories and world building lore of sometimes tie simplest things that didn't exactly need that much detail but noted either way.\\n\\n\r\nSo characters, well as LA said before Kirito grows as a Gary Stu FINALLY, with him not being an all powerful main protagonist this installment, well he like Reki Kawahara, he doesn't want his mistakes from his past to haunt him and this is through him wanting to protect those close to him  Eugeo and Alice voiced by Ai Kayano, both a \"childhood friend\" in Underworld, so say that Kirito actually develops as a character is a feat and quite honestly one of the best signs that that Reki Kawahara knew Kirito needed more development from the start. Eugeo is something of a companion, \"best friend\" character towards Kirito, heck he grows from the meek, shy and orderly character to a more confident character through the course of the anime and latter his desires are tested. Alice, the psudeo-namesake of \"Alicization\", at first gets \"put on the bus\" thus her screentime was diminished, but once she comes back into focus, well she's quite different to say, but nonetheless like Kirito and Eugeo, grows in a ways more like showing the authority of the higher ups of Underworld is not what she thinks it is...and to say that Alice was LA's favorite character of Sword Art Online: Alicization is a frickin' understatement, a lady of war, a badass and pretty much Shinon 2.0 without the \"harem disease\" status, she was and IS a fully realized character that isn't just harem bait. \\n\\n\r\nOn terms of villains, well they are major step up from the Aincrad and fairy Dance arc villains by a MILE, as they at best are shown as sympathetic characters, sometimes against their will, yes they are obstacles for Kirito and Eugeo, but we learn more about them, through their battles and they just aren't so stock, that you kinda feel sorry for some of them. As for the major villain of Sword Art Online: Alicization, well LA \"gets\" her intentions and she's malicious and even with her backstory covered and whatnot, she does have a purpose, not ony a threat to Kirito and Eugeo but humankind, because in game terms, she's pretty much a self-aware rogue program out for blood and \"shake fist at God\" villain, she's an existential nihilist doing only what she does to survive. So depth and not stock evil?...yeah leagues better in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online: Alicization's animation done by A1-Pictures is almost movie quality to how polished and detailed it is, almost like they got the animators from ordinal Scale and got them to work on Sword Art Online: Alicization and to be honest, the animation done by A1-Pictures was stellar, great and detailed character designs and crazy sword battles. There were some censors but to be honest needed as Sword Art Online: Alicization does get indeed graphic and in one notorious episode where censors (though LA hates them), helped..in a ways. A1-Pictures really outdid themselves really. Exceptional quality and consistency and A1 did it.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, well you know LA is just gonna praise the hell out of Ai Kayano as Alice, but to say that Nobunaga Shimazaki as Eugeo and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Kirito also needs to get a mention. The only other voice actors to note are Sakura Tange as Cardinal with her odd but enticing cadence and the major villain of Sword Art Online: Alicization voiced by Maaya Sakamoto who did excellently in portraying the oozing amount of villainess contempt she had.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any flaws LA could see in Sword Art Online: Alicization, well there are of course, but one is that the exposition does not necessary kill but drag the plot, yes the exposition is useful for the plot ahead but still. Sword Art Online: Alicization does feel very much like a game world what with all the exposition layed out, but there are time sin the plot where it was a bit contrived and coincidental at times, yes you can call this plot armour for Kirito and Eugeo, but LA will defend this flaw as Kirito isn't the god he was in the first season as in Sword Art Online: Alicization and Kirito goes through a personal development about the same plot armour being broken and hell he loses, he gets wrecked. But to say around the middle of the anime, it does get a bit coincidental to save the main protagonists...not utterly forced thankfully. Sword Art Online: Alicization has it's problems, but it's strengths definitely outweighs it's weaknessness.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online: Alicization is getting a continuation of it in a second season but for what Sword Art Online: Alicization gave us as of now, it's not only a HUGE step up from Reki Kawahara, but it's definitely on it's way to being amazing. It seems Reki Kawahara goal of righting his wrongs of Sword Art Online is indeed showing and for the first half, it already showed it's potential in being something great, let's just hope the second season follows through and gives us an excellent climax to what's ahead.",

            "content": "[Sword Art Online: Alicization First Cour Review]\r\nDISCLAIMER:\r\nThis review assumes that you have watched the previous two seasons of Sword Art Online and possibly the Ordinal Scale movie, which canonically takes place in between Mother's Rosario and Alicization - as retconned by Reki Kawahara the author of SAO himself. This review is also more suited to those who have watched the twelve episodes of Alicization that have aired so far and NOT those who are only about to begin watching the anime.\r\n-----\r\nI'm reviewing this as someone who has read the entire fan-translated Alicization arc and is a fan of the SAO franchise. I feel like Ineed to preface this, my first SAO anime review, by saying that I get the people who are on the other side of the spectrum - that is, the people who hate SAO. However I won't go into full detail and instead only give my short opinion, that people hate SAO like they hate any other popular entertainment or media franchise. Because more people know about its existence, the more chances it has to garner haters as well as fans. Simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nTo those people though, the Sword Art Online: Alicization arc might just be enough to tip you to the other side, or at least turn your opinion on this franchise into an uncertain neutrality. Having said that, I will try to make this review as inclusive as possible - to fellow fans like me and to the passionate haters. \\n\\n\r\nLet me begin right away: Alicization has a beautiful concept, it really does. The idea of a virtual world indistinguishable from the real physical world has long been teased in the former arcs. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the eight light novel volumes that preceded it (or the two 25-episode seasons for anime-only people) were merely setting up for Alicization. In simplest terms, Alicization is the climax of the Sword Art Online story. \\n\\n\r\nBut the idea of a climax that takes ten(!) light novel volumes and reportedly fifty or so episodes in animation to tell does not really seem promising.\\n\\n\r\nReki Kawahara, the author of SAO, still suffers from his introducing-shit-out-of-nowhere syndrome. Granted we haven't really seen this yet on this first cour of the Alicization anime, but trust me when I say it will get worse as we go on. Also, he still relies on infodumping literally the entire plot/premise instead of letting the characters find out through natural interaction and discovery. And of course the infamous episode ten, where he proves yet again that the only way he can write remotely villainous \"villains\" is by making creepy aristocrat perverts who are like that because why the hell not? \"I have money and influence and I'll use them to swing my dick at you!\" Sure, you can chalk this out to the fact that Alicization was written in the 2000's when this villain archetype was a lot more common, but that's no excuse for lazy writing. As I was reading the light novels I fell asleep multiple times, with the fascination of this amazing concept and philosophy of virtual worlds the author created being the only thing that carried me to finish reading the arc. Yeah, I'm a fucking nerd.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Reki Kawahara knows how to write great ideas. Conceptualize. He just needs improvement at telling stories. For evidence of that look no further than episode six.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nRight! So I've got all the mainly negative stuff out of the way! I have also digressed too much, so let's go to purely this first cour that A-1 pictures has graciously gifted us. I'll be using criteria points to make things easier. A numerical value for each criteria is at the end of this review.\\n\\n\r\n[Premise]\\n\\n\r\nAlicization will appeal to anyone who's even remotely interested in the idea of living in another world, getting a chance to be in a place where no knows who you are - where you can start anew. In this sense, Alicization should probably already appeal to a lot of people. Right from the onset of the first episode we are greeted with unfamiliar scenery with the only familiar thing being Kirito himself, who we all know lives, breathes, and interacts in a real physical world much like ours. However he acts as if he has been living in this new world all along, complete with memories, clothing conforming to the fashion in that world, and even close friends - and that's something I really loved about the introduction and that they took an entire episode worth of screen time for it. For a moment there, SAO was able to apply one of the golden rules of good story-writing - show, don't (only) tell. Both in LN and anime, I was genuinely interested in all three of the young characters and their interactions as humans living in a next-level virtual world, no matter how brief that time lasted.\\n\\n\r\nTo any sci-fi fan out there, the idea - concept, behind the virtual world itself is something truly fascinating, and in my opinion the most noteworthy achievement of this anime so far. Quantum physics is involved heavily and do you know why I think it was done good? Because I don't freakin' understand it! Even now I still don't get how the Soul Translator truly works - especially when it involves vague and touchy subjects like the 'soul', and that's fine. No one really understands quantum shit at first!\\n\\n\r\nAlicization deals with heavy stuff like law and order and if there ever is a time when an individual can justifiably break it. To overcome limits set by societal standards and rules, to make it sound more positive. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course we still get our usual beautifully-drawn and animated sword fights and action scenes. Nothing new here.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Plot and Setting]\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in the outside world is nothing special. Kirito suffers a life-threatening condition during a normal day walking home with Asuna in the real world and his only hope of recovery might be in the revolutionary STL technology which he has been doing test runs for. Unfortunately, Megane-kun the enigmatic JSDF secretary is in charge and as we all know he has been interested in Kirito since the SAO incident. He takes him away... to the middle of the freaking ocean! Asuna then of course uses her usual Mary Sue shit in an attempt to bring back her one true love who, for all intents and purposes, can be considered kidnapped. How nice it must be to be rich and influential.\\n\\n\r\nThe real deal is in the Underworld. At first it seems like the ideal fantasy world, a peaceful quiet place where one can live without fear of dying due to evil monsters and wars and shit. To enhance that sense of safety further, ultimate warriors with the highest skills in both swordfighting and magic known as Integrity Knights patrol the lands regularly, in case the people need to remind themselves just how.. safe they are. As long as they live quietly. As long as they obey. To say any more would be spoilers, so I leave only this quote (paraphrased) from an anime, \"If someone always follows the right path without ever failing, is that really what's best for them?\" Just what is the price to pay, if there is any, for the perfect state of peace and progress the Underworld has achieved?\\n\\n\r\nThe Underworld itself is one of the better fantasy worlds I have seen in any media. Then again, I am biased towards anything that involves high fantasy and/or new worlds, so I'm not really the best judge for the setting of Alicization. \\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Character and Story Development]\\n\\n\r\nKirito is Kirito. He is Jesus-kun. Chick magnet. Edgy, but with just the right sense of morals and values. However in Alicization his OP-ness has taken a direct hit! Or so it seems at the beginning. But it is clear that he can no longer, and does not - at least immediately, roflstomp people like he did in Aincrad, Alfheim, or that lightsaber bullshit in GGO. His way of thinking and approach into fights can be said to have grown more careful, more mature, and more refined. Although that could be because the pain he feels in the Underworld is essentially 1:1, unlike previous VR worlds with pain receptor settings. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Eugeo is a character I have mixed feelings for. He's absolutely well-written, but only in the context of Kirito and as his faithful travelling companion, close friend, and fellow budding swordsman. When Kirito is taken out of the context he's a character with nearly zero redeeming qualities and nothing interesting about him at all. The seal of the right eye, System Alert Code:871, is a good way to make him feel even more artificial. Which is funny because you know, he is really artificial. It doesn't help his case when Reki Kawahara decided to pull the shit-out-of-nowhere card with him one too many a time. I really want to like Eugeo, but he feels more like a plot device than a real human. Which is funny because, yeah . .\\n\\n\r\nAlice, ah yes the beautiful Alice. Part of why I like Alice so much is the idea, the drama - the romance, that comes from naming an entire part of a long story after her! Alicization. A word made by combining 'Alice' and the suffix '-tion'. Does that mean this arc emphasizes the state or quality of Alice, as what \"Alicization\" would imply? But I digress. Alice is our lead female. A headstrong, kind, smart, beautiful youth - one of the two friends Kirito makes in his first dives into the Underworld. Comes back ten episodes later as the even more beautiful but now cold and hard as steel Integrity Knight Alice Synthesis Thirty. The part of the story that turns Alice from a plot point to a well-written, interesting and dynamic character hasn't really aired yet, so there's not much I can say about her right now.\\n\\n\r\nSAO's supporting cast is hit and miss and Alicization continues this trend. Asuna is the chick determined to bring back Kirito, in what is nearly a reversal of their roles from the Alfheim Online (Fairy Dance) arc. Kirito's other friends barely get any screen time aside from Sinon in the first episode. The team in charge of the STL technology are nothing to write home about either aside from Megane-kun with his usual mysterious megane tendencies. On the other hand, the supporting cast in the Underworld is absolutely fantastic! Liena-senpai is one of the most beautiful anime girls I have seen in a long time, and of course Tiese and Ronie are best valets! \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the story, or rather how it will develop from here on, and this will be quick as the arc is only about one-fourth done as of this writing. Alicization will be the biggest story SAO has ever told, dwarfing everything before it in size, importance, amount of characters, consequences, and implications going into the future. It will also attempt to explain some of the unsolved mysteries such as how way back in SAO Kirito was able to come back to life to defeat Kayaba (and Asuna overcoming that paralysis) with what seemed like complete and utter plot armor at that point. Now that last bit is important as a significant part of how the STL works is directly connected to the answer Kirito comes to. Alicization will be darker and more edgy going forward but definitely has more lessons to teach.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Animation and Art]\\n\\n\r\nThe SAO anime was already known for having top-tier art and animation but Alicization ups the game even more. Every minute is movie quality on par with the level of Ordinal Scale. If you've watched that movie, then you know how ridiculously slick it looks. Perhaps the most important visual aspect - the sword fights and the sparks and dust from the action scenes, are also done accurately which I really appreciate in my fantasy-type anime, thank you very much. It's clear that A-1 are really taking this project seriously and it shows in every smooth fluid frame of animation and the attention to detail. I have nothing more to say but that I am looking forward to the Blu-Ray release of Alicization as I just know it will look gorgeous when polished and treated further.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Soundtrack]\\n\\n\r\nThe Yuki Kajiura brand of quality anime OST graces SAO yet again, perhaps at the best possible time as it is now telling the climax of its story.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention LiSA is back! And damn, she hasn't lost her magic touch at all. If anything, she only got better. ADAMAS is such a hype-inducing OP and is pretty related to Alicization, more specifically to Eugeo imo. The ED is yet again Eugeo-focused and is a bit more toned down and melodramatic, but with the same magnitude of feeling as the energetic and upbeat OP.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Production and Replay Value]\\n\\n\r\nA-1 are really upping the standards for production with Alicization. Ofc anime production quality in general has been only getting better through the years as competition continues to increase but even in Fall 2018, a season packed with lots of decent shows with similarly high production value, Sword Art Online Alicization manages to snuggle comfortably into the top through not only its popularity but also with consistently movie-budget quality levels of animation and art, the lethal Yuki Kajiura-LiSA combination (also seen in Fate/Zero for reference), a captivating virtual world with good concept, and an overall improved main character in Kirito. Regrettably, the only thing holding it back is the actual storytelling in its source material, but I have faith that A-1 will do the best adaptation they can going forward. \\n\\n\r\nNo replay value yet as the anime is only about one-fourth done through the arc.\\n\\n\r\n--\\n\\n\r\n[Summary of Sword Art Online: Alicization's elements]\\n\\n\r\nPremise: 8/10\\n\r\nPlot and Setting: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 9/10\\n\r\nStory Development: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation and Art: 9/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10/10\\n\r\nProduction value: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe best: Animation and art, soundtrack, production value, character development\\n\r\nThe good: Story development, premise\\n\r\nThe bad: Plot and setting, the storytelling technique of the author\\n\\n\r\nThat's it! I might update this review once the entire Alicization arc has been adapted. Let's hope A1-sama does not falter all the way!\\n\\n\r\nStay cool~",

On a technical standpoint, the show looks and sounds good. the action scenes err of the side of over dramatic, but are still pretty solid all in all. If they had a decent story to work with, this could be great. \r\nHowever, as usual with this series, all the mistakes have been made in the writer's room. They have a real opportunity to power down Kirito and make him vulnerable. Do they? Of course not! So is there ever any real tension for any of the fights?Nope! Lord god Kirito will save the day with his trump card power, deus ex machina! Asuna is a badass, so lets stick her in the control room out of the way. Can they make it a whole season without sexually assaulting a female character? Nah! They decide to go two for one this time. They do a poor job developing new characters. The world building is messy at best. The crap that goes on in the real world is barely more realistic than what goes on in the MMO. This is a lazy, disjointed mess of a story. \\n\\n\r\nI realize the screenwriters are trying to be true to the source material.  However, this source material is bad. SAO, as a whole, is a perfect example of doing everything you can to try to elevate bad material, and still failing because no matter how pretty it is presented, a bad story is a bad story. People see through this shine and see all muck and mire beneath it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to be able to follow the online bashing another season will get, go ahead an watch it.

I briefly mention other seasons.\r\nThis season has been one of my favourite from the SAO franchise however, I do have one problem with it.\r\n-I don't like the fact that another sexual assault scene is in the new season. There were two in the fairy arc and another in the gungale arc. I wasn't shocked to see it as it has happened multiple times before thus it doesn't really bring a shock factor anymore so I don't really understand why it has to be in there. Ialso find these scenes (especially this seasons)are very long winded which adds to the problem.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the soundtrack and animation are really great and I do like the new characters they've added. \\n\\n\r\nObviously it's not perfect but I do think it's an entertaining watch. I would add more but the season is not finished yet.\\n\\n\r\nFirst review btw go easy on me lol",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is one of my favorite anime, it was the first one I watched over the internet so it has a special place in my life. I'm amazed how the anime that surprised me in 2012 can do that even today.\r\nStarting with the story, it's a standard Sword Art Online, Kirito is going to another game, this time against his will. The focus of the story is\r\nin the relationship he develops with Eugeo, he will help him as a real friend to redeem his childhood friend Alice who was kidnapped for violating one of the rules of the institution that commands that world(a kind of church). Helping in the rescue of the friend of Eugeo can make Kirito understand more about which world this is where he is, so he decides to help him, they become great friends during the journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful, the scenes of Sword Art Online are always good-looking. Battle animations keep catching the eye with special effects very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs and the opening are all very good, the opening is addictive and some OSTs bring feelings in the right moment, both in battle scenes and in dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters is undoubtedly the best compared to the other seasons of Sword Art Online, Alice, a friend of Eugeo and Kirito who was kidnapped in special is very beautiful and has more prettier armor, she looks very much like the Saber from Fate series.",

            "content": "Alicization is a weird one.\r\nAs somebody that who has been critical on previous iterations of SAO, it feels weird to say that I genuinely \"enjoyed\" this season. This however, is also because I was comparing SAO:A with the likes of season 1 and 2. In the end, are there flaws? ABSOLUTELY. Can you still watch it and have a above average time? Yes as well. \r\nHere are the major points I found.\r\n+ Kirito is no longer overpowered\r\nOur edgy protagonist has gotten somewhat of a make over in terms of power. He no longer can just whip out handy 'ol Yui to bail him out ofsituations, nor can he go against someone seemingly x10 his strength and win anymore, .\\n\\n\r\n+ Side characters are actually useful\\n\r\nOur \"sidekick\" for Kirito is Eugeo, and sometimes we forget that its not him thats at the center of our story. We are introduced to a large group of characters also, some we love, some we hate. \\n\\n\r\n+ Not every female character has a crush on Kirito\\n\r\nThats quite the revelation right there\\n\\n\r\n- Whatever happens in the real world is forgettable at best\\n\r\nWhenever the setting reverted back to the real world, the story simply becomes boring. Leaving you wanting to just go back to the world where Kirito and Eugeo are.\\n\\n\r\n- Lack of on-screen growth for Kirito\\n\r\nIts evident that Kirito is growing, both as a person and in skill. But these pieces of evidence is only called upon when they are absolutely needed, and appear to all be off-screen. You can see growth for the side-characters however, but its not really seen in Kirito.\\n\\n\r\n-Time skips are still a thing\\n\r\nDont want to spoil to much here but, though it is explained and recapped, it does somewhat get annoying as it was one of the big critiquing points against the Aincrad arc.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, is it anime of the season?\\n\r\nAbsolutely not\\n\r\nis it for everyone?\\n\r\nNo\\n\r\nshould you watch it?\\n\r\nGive it a try, it may surprise you\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's something about SAO Alicization that differs from the other SAO anime. Usually with SAO the only emotional connection you would feel was between Asuna and Kirito. In Alicization the main difference that makes it better than previous SAO anime is the real connection they show between Kirito and Eugeo. Their bond makes me jealous. I wish I had a best friend like that, who would be with me through it all, to be brothers.\r\nThe downside of Alicization is the cliffhanger you get left with. It concludes the main story but at the end there's a slight turn of event which we will have towait for the second season to see.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall the story was good. I liked the plot, especially the part with Kirito in the virtual world. There were some episodes in the middle where I started to lose interest but nearing the final episodes, things started to get interesting again.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nArt was above average I would say. The only downside was the occasional bad cg.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nSound was great. I liked the choice of sound effects for sword duels. It was quite crisp and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nOverall character development for Kirito, Eugeo and Alice was great. For the others I would say it was average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nIt starts off great. Around the middle you might start losing interest, but it's definitely worth watching it because it gets better around the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nIf you liked the plot of the first few SAO anime you definitely will like Alicization. I'd say Alicization is the best SAO anime yet. The only downside is having to wait for the next season, otherwise, it's worth watching.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nI wrote SAO review about my opinions on series and opinions of those who disliked it or hated it. Now i'll write more opinion on series and Alicization. Before i could review Alicization arc,i have to get this off my chest.\r\nSword Art Online anime series do have problems that some part of audience can't overlook and made them dislike it or hate it,but problems that SAO have are not THAT bad! I have watched the worst anime such as Mars Of Destruction,Pupa,Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and Wounded Man (Kizuoibito) so i could tell you how to recognize a REAL bad anime and thatproblems that SAO have are not a big deal in worst anime i watched. SAO anime series does not have same problems that Mars Of Destruction,Pupa,Tenkuu Danzai Skelter+Heaven and Wounded Man have! They are not on same level either! I can't spoil them so now that i gotten that off my chest,let's talk about Alicization anime now.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with story first. SAO anime series along with Alicization DO have story that is not well written,but it's not horrible either. Alicization's plot have decent writing and interesting dialogues which makes this anime enjoyable,but problems that it's have is not big deal and it's have problems that can be overlooked. 6/10 because i don't care about anime plots and i have nothing to say about story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation in Alicization is great. I loved how fight scenes and other great scenes in anime are animated,especially the fight scene between Kirito and Quinella. Also,weapon and character's art are great as well,i liked Kirito's new black sword (Night Sky Sword),Eugeo's Blue Rose Sword and Alice's golden Fragrant Olive Sword artworks are designed. Character's art design of Alice i loved the most,she is beautiful like Asuna. 10/10 for great art and animation\\n\\n\r\nMusic,soundtrack and voice acting is great and flawless. I love both opening songs,which are great for my ears and lyrics is great as well,but they cannot beat Crossing Field,one of my favorite anime songs of all times. Ending songs are great too,i loved forget-me-not,it's melody,lyrics and vocals,it's like Aimer and YUI (one who sang Again,opening song for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) combined together. Forget-me-not is in same level as Shirushi and Yume Sekai,very addicting and great songs. Soundtrack in Alicization is music to my ears and voice acting is great as well. I liked how my favorite voice actresses like Haruka Tomatsu and Ai Kayano voiced the Asuna and Alice flawlessly with spirit and Kirito's voice actor done a great job with Kirito's lines. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka is very good at giving voice to characters that have warrior's spirit and confidence. 10/10 for that.\\n\\n\r\nNow here we are with characters... Oh,boy,all that hatred towards my favorite characters... Especially mai waifus... -_-\\n\\n\r\nRegarding Kirito,he is not a bad protagonist. Generic looks for which i don't care about aside,for those who said he got no personality: 'No personality' is not right word to describe the characters who are not lacking any kind of emotions and who are not Kuudere. Just because his personality changed every time because SAO turned into death game,lost people who cared about such as Sachi,helping players in trouble,fallen in love with Asuna and all other things that happened in SAO anime series and Alicization or because his personality is lacking some certain characteristics or features you expected does not mean he have 'no personality'. He just acts like a normal human being would. Any normal human being would act calm and collected,emotional and hot-headed in battles,depending on person's nature. Personalities of male protagonists are not easy to write or describe. Kirito's personality is not written well,but it's not horrible. It's have pros and cons and i don't see anything wrong with him behaving like that.\\n\\n\r\nNow about Kirito being OP... OP or overpowered characters can be good characters in many ways,but their powers can be unbalanced if character or their power is not well written or because character lacks something that makes his OP nature enjoyable. Kirito is very powerful,but not OP. To be OP,he must be completely invincible like Saitama (One Punch Man) or Tatsuya Shiba (Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei) or any unbeatable OP character. Kirito have weaknesses and almost died many times and also he was defeated 4 times. (once in Fairy Dance arc fighting NPC guardians,twice against Yuuki in a duels and once to protect Asuna,Yuuki and Sleeping Knights so they could defeat a boss) That is not only reason why Kirito's powers are balanced,he also have motivation to use his powers,internal struggles and faced many difficult challenges and conflicts. (also he lost his arm in Alicization) He is not mere 'power fantasy' OP character and also,his powers are unique. Some of people don't like when some protagonists always win,but anime is not about winning or losing! How would plot progressed if Kirito wasn't powerful? He is smart and great swordsman,which makes him worthy opponent. Overall,he is decent protagonist with balanced powers and mixed personality and traits that make him fun and enjoyable character.\\n\\n\r\nNow for main characters,antagonists and supporting characters. Asuna is cute and beautiful,as usual. Same for other female characters from previous seasons. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Alice,she got a great figure,many cute traits and she is beautiful. Such a beautiful blue eyes,golden hair... Also she can cook like Asuna and she got a cute personality at the time when Kirito and Alice were climbing at tower :) Great waifu material,i gotta say,even thought she became Integrity Knight with some of her memories and emotions weakened. Alice's role is written very well,i gotta say. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Eugeo,a village boy who is Kirito's best friend,he is good character. I like how he grows up by learning Kirito's sword style and his speeches,which is good to see character who grows up and having very important at this arc. Even though he is weak person,but his heart and swordsmanship and determined personality is strong enough to sacrifice himself to defeat Sword Golem. \\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters,i don't really care that much about them so i have nothing to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nHere we are now talking about antagonists in Alicization who i hate the most.\\n\\n\r\nFirst,corrupted noblemen who tried to rape two girls who were Kirito's and Eugeo's disciples,Ronnie and Tiese,i hated them sooo much.\\n\r\nSecond,that Chudelkin is real ugly mother*****r,i hate him sooo much.\\n\r\nAnd finally,Quinella or Administrator,she is despicable like Oberon. Not only she got a God complex,but unlike Oberon,who planned to mind control 300 players he trapped,Quinella is power hungry evil ruler who treats her people as a food for Sword Golems and steals a memories to mind control some people giving them fake 'love' and stuff and making them Integrity Knights. I hate her so much in same way i hate Oberon and Prime Minister. (Akame Ga Kill) 9.5/10 for characters (antagonists not included)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really,really loved and enjoyed it to fullest. I loved the fight scenes,my favorite is one in last episode where Kirito defeats Quinella with Vorpal Strike with a badass way. And that opening and ending songs were sooo amazing that i put then on my phone. Alicization,just like the movie and previous seasons,were very fun to watch and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n\r\nAlicization was a masterpiece! I loved almost everything on it. I know that anime series have flaws that ruined someone's enjoyment,but flaws in anime series are not bad enough to ruin huge success it's gotten.\\n\\n\r\nWhy some people who dislike or hate flaws that are not a big deal?\\n\r\nBecause some flaws that are not fatal or can be overlooked are too much for some part of audience who were high at expectations or have different tastes and standards. They focus too much on problems rather than thinking of good points and hidden gems.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online anime series have huge commercial success and look at stats at MAL,so many people gave 10/10's,9/10's,8/10's and 7/10's. That means that majority liked or loved them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of 'bad' protagonist is number 13 and have 32,839 favorites in MAL?\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of 'bad' waifu is number 37 and 20,164 favorites in MAL?\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of 'bad' anime gets this huge success? \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of 'bad' light novels sold 22 million copies worldwide? \\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of 'bad' anime movie gets 38.2 million dollars at box office? \\n\\n\r\nFrom merchandise to video games such as Hollow Fragment,Lost Song,Hollow Realization,Accel World vs SAO and Fatal Bullet,those are proof of SAO's success and popularity. \\n\r\nIf anime and light novels were THAT bad,it's would not get such a huge commercial success and popularity,fan base,merchandise and video games and i would not talk about it here. If anime series are successful and if majority loved it or liked it,then they are objectively good anime series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope for next season be great as this anime. Link Start!\\n",

            "content": "I just want to say : RIP Alicization...\r\nStory : 8, Art : 7, Sound : 7, Character : 6, Enjoyment : 6\r\nI ask you to read completely my review \r\nFor information I am a big fan of the saga Sword Art Online, what brought me has to read everything them light novel of Reki Kawahara and participated in the preview of the first episode. After my reading of the volumes the arc Sword Art Online Alicization who went out in my country, I clearly found the light novel amazing and consequently there was not more hyped than I in her taken out of the animeadaptation by A-1 Pictures the studio which realized the movie Ordinal Scale and the first 2 seasons.\\n\r\n[SPOIL]\\n\r\nThe teaser was very hyped, we could see a very good animation, an uncluttered and colored chara-design there, sounds and opening of high quality sung by LiSA. But it was apparently only a simple illusion... This new chara-design reached its limits from the fifth episode, besides the protagonists, the antagonists (male mainly) possess a too much colored design and non-existent details what to create a big imbalance and it goes even affected the protagonists as Kirito afterward. I think the animation, the chara-design and even the sound effects of the movie Ordinal Scale were much more suitable, even if there is no big difference either\\n\\n\r\nAt present there are 14 episodes of available and I am enormously disappointed, really has to say from the first episode I was already a little disappointed, but the more I to look livened up moved forward, the more my disappointment was big. From the first episode they began has to remove scenes of the novel and to introduce scenes non-existent in the novel light (example: the scene in GGO and the scene where we see Kirito on a hospital bed with tears after the removal of Alice). They introduce scenes which deprive us quite our doubts about the history.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality everything was a little near correct till the end the fourth episode, in particular the fight enters kirito and the gobelin which was really good, from there everything was correct, until the moment  they begin to look after Eugeo seriously hurt by the Gobelin, the scene one we see Alice in the back of Kirito was really ridiculous! I felt much more emotion by reading a piece of paper, while he should have been the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThen we arrive in the reality with Asuna in the Ocean Turtle, this sequence has nothing of alarm, except one! We are seen two scientists where I know who to give one to smile roguish, these small seconds introduced into the livened up and not into the novel still allows us one to guess the continuation of the events futures, they wanted doubtless placed a feeling of curiosity but it gives rather an effect denial.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately the first one opening succeeded has to compensate for one certain parts of numerous errors of the studio, or the director more exactly, this opening is for me clearly the best opening of the year with Violet Evergarden, the ending on the other hand has nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the episode 5 everything the fights which follow are of a ridiculous one ... They did not succeed that added bright effects without any utility, it's as if it was a 14-year-old child who tried for the first time to manage the animation of a fight, he does everything to add special effects but who in the end returns the ridiculous scene. This detail applies not only to the fight but also to the scenes which are supposed to be less dynamic but more moving as the scene where we can perceive the flowers of kirito resuscitated and kirito he in tear, this scene also was ridiculous and deprived of feeling to be passed on us and all defects do only repeated throughout the livened up, Administrator has no charisma, we could wonder if it is really a miserable one, it is the same thing for the knight Eldrie who does not absolutely give the impression of being an enemy of our protagonists, because of this new chara-design we forget totally the feeling of danger which is supposed to be in Sword Art Online, his rather gives the impression us of being in one livened up Slice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nThe episode 14 of taken out, an opening new gets in anime him, the song is good and the animation is fine, so overall it's not bad, but less well than the first. I shall also like speaking sound effects graying of the blades colliding, in my opinion, which is not suited to the pictures. In this episode the animation of the fight is slightly better than the precedent, but of not much, in this episode we can also notice no character of Eugeo and kirito personality changed compared with to the season 1, the only character that I find interesting is Alice.\\n\\n\r\nIn brief... Everything to say that anime Sword Art Online Alicization was not able to revealed his real potential because of a change of director / director and studio which supported him, A-1 Pictures is altogether a very good studio thanks to these works such as: Your Lie In April, Nanatsu no Taizai, Erased, Gate, Grimgar, Magi, Black Butler, Shinsekai No Yori, Darling in the Franxx, Fatre/Apocrypha, and Fairy Tail, but made of big error for Alicization who should have been better than the previous seasons, and according to me the biggest culprit here is other than the new director Manabu Ono who destroyed any hope to see being born Sword Art Online's new and good season, because of his I am going to hate him all my life. I thus think that the old director Tomohiko Itou was much better.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: the anime is very disappointing and is not as high as the light novel original.\\n\\n\r\n(and i'm sorry for my bad english and my many faults)",

            "content": "Sword Art Online has been the most maligned anime that the world has ever seen, sometimes criticized with reason, sometimes being criticized by the sake of criticizing it, sometimes criticizing it just to follow the current. But in the Alicization, most of the critique is surprisingly more subdued due to the significant upgrades of the problems that affected the earlier arcs. I will include some spoilers, so go with caution.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nFor the first time since ever, Kirito is a mere mortal, he shows that he's a mortal human after all; no more destroying bullets at a 5 meter range. The fact that he gets almostassassinated in the real world proves that. Now into a strange world, much different to the classic MMORPG Kirito used to play, he meets a young Eugeo and a young Alice in a remote village, and both saw how Alice violated the Taboo Index and gets kidnapped by the Integrity Knights.\\n\\n\r\nAlso for a very first time in SAO, Kirito's main companion is a boy, Eugeo, which significantly alters the concept of the \"Kirito's harem\" plot and the Kirito OP thought, both guys devise plans to progress in the seemingly perfect Realm of the Humanity, never overstepping into each other, rather complementing each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter inclusion of Alice is an anti-thesis of the classic Kirito girl, somehow strong girl, but always dependant on Kirito, She shows that she can stand up to Kirito, even helping him, showing his errors, and entangling a very similar chemistry like the Kirisuna duo. This rare trio between Kirito, Eugeo and Alice is by far the biggest selling point in the anime, because each other complements so well the other two.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is almost barred from the story after the Ocean Turtle part, save a few cameos in the final part, but this is not needed at all due to the extremely strong story and characters that gives SAO Alicization its earned praise. This is in spite of my personal valoration that Asuna is the biggest reason that SAO managed to be a very popular and decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning that the Alicization departs from the traditional SAO rule of high violence, zero blood, the Underworld shows the extreme closeness that it has with the real world, depicting blood as a normal.\\n\\n\r\nThe background concepts are the most insightful parts of the Alicization arc, an almost perfect world created by the Interior Ministry of Japan, philosophical elements like war morals, regulation of morals, social cohesion, secret government projects, etc. are entangled in our psyche and how questioning or not can make a difference depending on your own set of ethical codes. \\n\\n\r\nThat's what the Underworld's nature shows, the blending created in order to establish a never questioned totally hierarchical order explains in how authoritarianism executes its evilness, better explained in the philosophical dialogues of the Administrator in how she should be above everything and because he loves so much their subjects and the peace, she enforces a crypto-tyranny to do so. Does she reminds you to someone who has usurped the presidency in an oil country in the Americas?\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, SAO Alicization is not only a big leap for the classic SAO concept of Kirito saving every girl in danger, it's the quasi-questioning of the entire concept of the social relationships, enforcement of moral values, and societal structures that currently rule our real world.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nSAO Alicization takes the animation of Ordinal Scale, which was the finest of the finest of A-1 Pictures, but it was basically unsustainable over the course of 2 cours (580 mins worth of the OS animation), this shows midway the course with weird models and weird falls. That of course reflected on the decision to split the cours in order to not continue degrading the animation. In spite of that, the Alicization animation is generally consistent and of the highest order.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty well made, and also the shades and tones are completely detailed, better shown in the rampant bleedings in several scenes. Liked how Eugeo and Alice have the more typical European phenotypes and Kirito has the more Japanese ones. The backgrounds are otherworldly, with a very high level of details to the point of watching each one of the tree leafs moving smoothly, also a big improvement from the first 2 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nYou know that SAO wouldn't be SAO without a Lisa song, Adamas is the classic Lisa song that opens the new world of the Alicization, Eir Aoi's Iris is a much more relaxed tune that calms you after the constant latent tension of the Beginning, Running and Turning of SAO Alicization. Asca's Resister is much darker than the usual SAO openings and consisten with the darker parts of what is the Rising, Dividing and Uniting arc, Forget-me-not from ReoNa is also more relaxing, but with darker overtones. \\n\\n\r\nThe background sounds are of course of the highest quality, Yuki Kajiura is still one of the finest composers in modern anime, aging like the wine, she always complements the mood and never oversteps nor overshadows the scenes, rather gives the tunes a superb significance in each of the movements made by the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are perfectly in synchro with each other, the inclusion of Ai Kayano as Alice follows a tried and tested formula with Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (Kirito) of the cold and closed girl with the charming and open boy, like the Mashiro Shiina-Sorata Kanda in Pet na Kanojo, Utaha Kasumigaoka-Tomoya Aki of Saekano, Shiro-Sora in No Game no Life. \\n\\n\r\nNobunaga Shimazaki as Eugeo is completely on song to the personality, which blends perfectly his performance of the seemingly cold Shidou Itsuka of Date a Live with the specifications required of Eugeo. Of the other performances, Sakura Tange (Sakura-chan of Cardcaptor Sakura) changes massively her cute voice to seiyuu Cardinal, Maaya Sakamoyo who also worked on CCS performs the seductive evil Quinella.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nBy many detractors, the SAO characters were one of the weakest points, but in Alicization, they're now one of the strongest parts. I'll only mention Kirito, Eugeo, Alice, Cardinal and Quinella.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is not anymore the OP character that gets all the chicks, now he gets all the boys (Eugeo). Jokes asides, now Kirito's mortality is on play, now he cannot get through due to his MC powers, he feels that he needs help and he just does that. Putting all his adquired knowledge over the time to solve the problems are now his motto, displaying a constant maturity and seriousness required in almost all the circumstances, long gone are the classical Kirito playfulness.\\n\\n\r\nEugeo is the biggest reason that the Alicization is without doubt the best arc of SAO, he is not an inferior to Kirito, rather his equal, always loyal to him until latter into the season, and there is where his mental vulnerability is shown magnificiently in falling to the temptation of the Pontifex. His interactions with Kirito is the classic one between a fluid and a rigid person, is also legendary.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is not your typical SAO girl who act tough but is always in constant need to be saved by Kirito. Instead, she can stand up to him, helping him to get over simple tasks like cooking dumplings or using her head to climb to the top of the Tower. Alice is also very closed-minded due to her upbringing as a Integrity Knight, but also sees in Kirito what she couldn't do. Her importance is vaguely mentioned at the very end of this arc.\\n\\n\r\nQuinella, or the very hot Administrator who is always naked, is the prototypical tyrant who doesn't display any sort of overt cruelty to their subjects unless forced, like a small-country dictator, she also wants to punch over her weight to challenge their masters that can erase her with just a click.\\n\\n\r\nCardinal is the rival of the Administrator, who after a fight she had to recluse herself in the Library of the Underworld in order to devise a plan to defeat her, after a long struggle, she managed to find Kirito and Eugeo, and latter Alice to finish that mission.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nTo the SAO haters, the Alicization arc won't change any mind, and this review is not targeted to them. I personally had struggled to defend the many decisions that Sword Art took in earlier seasons, but SAO Alicization made that more easy for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe leaps from a very popular MMO anime with a charismatic MC, to a more deeply moral and psychological anime still rooted on his origins raised my enjoyment to the highest levels, in not only as they've corrected many of the earlier faults, but it's an always evolving anime that keeps generating green paper to A-1 and Reki Kawahara, despite the constant and at this point tiring and annoying hate.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, SAO Alicization perfected the morals and philosophical questions presented with the classic flair of Aincrad that included several battles with swords, this time without Asuna, but with Eugeo and Alice. So Sword Art Online Alicization has clearly remembered and insisted that it's an anime about, well, Sword Arts.\\n\\n\r\nIn my book, SAO Alicization won't be into my Top-25 of favourites, but will be up there in animes that significantly progressed over their courses. That itself is my biggest satisfaction and pleasure, and it truly earned the rating I'm giving to it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 10/10.",

            "content": "This is my first review and I wanted to express my thoughts on a series that I've come to appreciate since the release of the very first SAO. \r\nI am not a LN reader (however I plan to do so) yet, I can tell that this season of SAO is at par, if not better, of the original SAO. I am aware that the anime doesn't do the LN justice by just focusing mainly on the action scenes and the harem that Kirito tends to carry every season but, I'm glad to see that this season took a much different approach. \r\nSince the first episodeof Alicization, I was totally surprised by the sudden change of world and characters. Characters that I got to care and not follow the same unfortunate route that most characters follow whenever they encounter Kirito. When the anime established the threat towards Kirito, I actually felt somewhat panicked, something I haven't felt since the first SAO. Seeing Kirito actually struggle for once got me to root for him, regardless if I knew that he was going to overcome certain obstacles without a problem. Seeing a character have proper development for once, truly satisfied me. Even if that development was quite minimal, and even when the anime still allowed Kirito to pull something out of his ass in certain situations. But whatever development wasn't present on Kirito, it was sure found in the second protagonist, Eugeo. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't care that much for Eugeo but as the story progressed, I became to be fond over him. His lack of confidence and the fear towards standing up and actually facing the challenges presented to him is something i came to appreciate a lot. Whenever he overcame his fears, it was as I was watching a child I've come to raise finally being able to fend for himself. Moments where he spent his time with Kirito demonstrated how much he looks up to him which could be a good thing as it can serve him as a goal for him to improve himself, however, it became clear later on how much of a double-edged sword that type of mentality would weigh on Eugeo. There is so much I wish to say about his accomplishments and failures but that is more spoiler info. \\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the rest of the anime, I can't really speak that much of Alice since her character holds tons of spoiler info but in summary, I couldn't relate to her that much due to the lack of screen time and development she was given. Hopefully in the next arc she will be given much more development since she is a very interesting character with lots of potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation never disappoints, the close-up fish-eye shots are always appreciated. Not to mention the delicious sakuga that are sprinkled all over this series. The sound effects seem to be taken from the Ordinal Scale movie which I happen to love quite a lot. The aggressive crunchy sounds of the swords clashing and pixelating sounds whenever a command was activated are just satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this arc of SAO so much. It truly brought back the same feeling I had when I first discovered SAO. It is nice seeing SAO beginning to be enjoyable once again, since the 2nd arc of SAO 1 was an utter disaster, not to mention SAO 2 with the exception of Mother Rosario. Hopefully things continue to get even better and seeing where the anime left off, I simply can't wait what's ahead.",

            "content": "Now, this is my first and probably only review on this site, but I thought I would give it a try. What's the worst that can happen, right? I'm not very good at reviewing things, so please take this with a grain of salt.\r\nSword Art Online needs no introduction at this point, as it has become one of the most popular and yet one of the most controversial anime that has come out in recent years. I have silently criticized Sword Art Online's first season with poor story and characters, but have always found merit in the show's production quality, which prevented me from entirelyhating it. The second season was a little bit better with easily my favorite story arc and character of the series, but still had some problems with it, namely the Excalibur Arc, which only served as a filler and really had no direction to it, and the Mother's Rosario Arc, which at that time, was my favorite thing to come out of Sword Art Online at the time. Now, we're finally at the Alicization Arc, which I can safely say is the best thing to come out of Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10\\n\r\nReki Kawahara, after all of these years of pretty poor writing, has finally learned how to write a proper story with some pretty decent worldbuilding, and an actually interesting fantasy world to go along with it. Alicization takes place in a place called the Underworld, a fantasy world kind of similar to other fantasy worlds that we've seen in the past years, with goblins, knights, and dragons, but has some game-like mechanics to it. It delves deep into how each mechanic works, and the history of this world, and how things are the way they are. Pacing for this is actually pretty decent when the series first started, but kind of got rushed during the last arc, Alicization United. I think that it would have definitely benefitted more by having 26 episodes than 24, but. In this fantasy world, Kirito meets a boy named Eugeo, an NPC of that world whose purpose is to cut down a giant tree; there, his adventures in the Underworld start. In this world, Eugeo tells Kirito a girl named Alice, who was his childhood friend and was taken away when he was younger after she broke a law, or the Taboo Index as they call it there. In the Alicization Beginning Arc, the first arc, not very much happens, as this really serves to build the world even further, which is a bit disappointing, as there were entire episodes dedicated to infodumps. However, in the last two arcs of the series, we get a clear goal that Kirito and Eugeo must meet, and I can't get into that without treading into spoiler territory. And yes, they even included some sort of rape scene that for some reason, Reki Kawahara likes to put, but it's in a way that's important to the plot and sets up the future events of the story. Another thing that I would like to point out is that this series tends to get much more violent than the past series, as there's a lot of blood that was shed during this series. Overall. it's a pretty solid story, but it's not anything groundbreaking, and you won't be missing too much by not watching this, but it's definitely an improvement of what we saw in the last two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9/10\\n\r\nAlicization uses the same art style as the Ordinal Scale movie and if you've, watched that movie, then you'll know how amazing both the art and animation are. It's a bit more complex than the original series art, and there are some still great moments of fight choreography. Background art is also amazing with highly detailed backgrounds, but it's obviously not as pretty as some films that come out in recent memory, but it's still nothing to scoff at. It loses a point because, in the second half of the show, the animation quality seemed to dip, and it really shows if you see a fight scene from there. One thing that I want to mention is the special effects, which are actually really good, though they are only particle effects most of the time, they still look really good, and adds to the complexity of some of the fight scenes that happen.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound department has also always been a positive aspect of the Sword Art Online franchise, and in this season, it's no different. All of the openings and endings are catchy as hell, especially the first opening, \"ADAMAS\" by LiSA, which has easily become my favorite opening of the series and just an explosion of hype, and one of my favorite anime songs in general. The OST, however, is not really that praiseworthy, as I couldn't find anything that notable besides the main OST song \"Swordland\", but other than that, there's nothing that I could point out. As for voice acting, I think it's pretty good. Some notable ones are that Matsuoka Yoshitsugu returns as Kirito, who's never been a bad voice actor and Ai Kayano plays Alice, and to be honest, I couldn't really see another person but her play that role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\r\nThe main cast of the Underworld, Kirito, Eugeo, and Alice are all fairly good characters. Kirito has been nerfed a bit, so he's basically not a god anymore and some sort of wish-fulfilling device that we've seen him be earlier in the series, but is still pretty strong. Eugeo, an NPC, and serves as Kirito's partner for this arc and finally Alice, the heroine. One thing that I liked was that Eugeo was actually a competent character, a person who could hold his own without the help of Kirito and could be said to be his equal, at least in this world, as shown in the later episodes during Alicization Rising. Alice as well is also a fairly solid character, and like Eugeo, she's also pretty strong and can hold her own weight. Out of the trio, Eugeo is the one to get the most development, as he goes from a weak lumberjack to a competent and strong swordsman, and all of it doesn't feel forced, it feels a bit more natural, as compared to the first season. As for the rest of the main Sword Art Online cast, they just pushed aside, and really don't serve a purpose besides Asuna, and even then, she's just kind of there just to be there. Plus, Yui, the Deus Ex Machina machine is still there, which I don't like, but at least she's not in the Underworld.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nLike I previously mentioned earlier, this is the best thing to come out of Sword Art Online, Kawahara has improved his writing skills, and it really shows, but his story and characters still need a bit of work. Though it was a pretty fun ride from beginning to end, there were a lot of moments that were boring, especially during the first arc and the ending felt a bit rushed. Animation and sound have always been on point, and this season is no different. I'll be eagerly waiting for the next part of this story.\\n",

            "content": "I watched the first season of SAO 6 years ago. It was one of the anime that got me into anime, so it holds a very special place in my heart, and I have been an SAO fan ever since then. After 6 years and lots of anime watching my love for the series has not waned much(though I have learned to accept much of the criticism it has received from the community). That being said, the second season, GGO, was an enjoyable watch for me, but I did not fall in love with it the same way I did when watching the first season.Mother's Rosario was my favorite ark in the second season, but overall the series seemed to lack the same flavor of the first season. The motivations behind the plot and the world building were too distinct from the first season. I think the 3rd season, when compared to season 2, is a lot more similar to the first season. The plot and world building is a lot closer to what SAO 1 was: being stuck in a virtual world, trying to save a loved one who is trapped by the villain, etc. One thing that separates the third season from the first is the relationship between Kirito and Eugeo. This time around, Kirito is less of a main character, and more of an accomplice to the main character. Whereas the first season focused on Kirito and his \"solo\" nature, and later shifted to his and Asuna's growing romance, the third season so far focuses on Kirito and Eugeo's relationship as best friends and nakama. As a result the distinctly harem vibes that this series had before seems to have been replaced by a fujoshi nakama vibe. An interesting change of pace that seems to have brought in more female fans to the series(a female friend of mine who was not blown away by the first or second season is absolutely in love with this current season). That is the most distinct and unique part of SAO 3 when compared to the previous seasons. Other than that, like I said before, it makes an effort to retain and replicate many of the things that made SAO 1 popular. While watching there were several moments when I thought to myself how similar it seemed to the first season, which is not a bad thing at all. Overall, I think any fan of the SAO series will enjoy this.",

            "content": "**NO SPOILER REVIEW** **AND IF YOURE LAZY, TL;DR AT BOTTOM**\r\n\"SAO is shit\" - Majority of people who watched SAO\r\nYes, the previous seasons had possibly the worst development and pacing. Yes, the only good part of SAO was the aincrad arc *until now*/.\r\nHere comes the alicization arc, a relatively boring concept at first glance. Oh hey, he gets captured in a vr world again. ahahaha. Like we haven't seen that so many times. I mean, you can't really take SAO in other ways cos 1. If you can log out, it makes it bad 2. If he doesn't log out, it makes no sense. There isprobably a way to overcome it, but I can't think of it at the top of my head.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc focuses more on the flaws of the previous SAO seasons and is fixing it slowly, one at a time. It's not Kirito saves everyone everytime anymore. He has this friend called Eugeo. They both have each other's backs and are searching for this girl named Alice, who was a childhood friend. While doing this, they advance through the world to become a powerful knight. The story develops from here on. The first 6 episodes don't really do much in terms of story progression, but they're fun.\\n\\n\r\nI was a huge fan of SAO and even I thought \"Damn, these negative criticism's are true. It's always Kirito saviour, the other guys don't do anything except act as an extra.\" But I'm really happy that the author is getting better and understands the criticism and is taking it in a positive way to 1-up his writing skills.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 10\\n\r\nThe art and sound are probably one of the best for SAO. I really like it. Nothing more to say other than Lisa's voice is amazing\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8\\n\r\nWhile changing the show's fundamentals, you can't go from 0-100 in a matter of an episode. As I said, it's fixing its flaws slowly. Kirito is still powerful but not as much as before and he has a ton of moments where he is weak as well. Far far far more than the previous seasons. This is the first time I think Kirito's undergoing character development\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\nBeing an SAO fan, I enjoy this quite well. Pretty sure other people think the same too. Hopefully this show lives on as the \"fixing the show\" arc\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : You should give it a try cos its better than the previous seasons and is fixing its flaws slowly. I'm sure that you'll like it a lot more than the previous SAO seasons if you go into it open minded and not \"oh, its SAO, BLEH\". Just clear your mind of the history while watching this and you'll enjoy it",

The sound is unoriginal and not as good as before. I enjoy Kiritos character, for the most part, kind of boring, and the new side character is not bad. The side characters that are supposed to be the snobbish royalty were overdone and too crazy; they were lazily written.\r\nSpoilers-ish\r\nThe world that Kirito enters isgod awful.

The main issue with the previous series was pacing; many events were too rushed and not given enough build up to achieve the desired impact on the story. \r\nIn the first series they tried to cram too many events into such a short series, it would have been much better if they had used the full 25 episodes to showcase the events of SAO rather than doing a 1/2 split between SAO and ALO arcs.\r\nOne example that readily comes to mind is the moonlit blackcats arc. They were given 1 episode and attempted to use that time to play the emotional game by killing them all off at the end. It didn't work very well because the viewers didn't see enough of these characters to really feel anything for them. No emotional buildup means no emotional climax.\\n\r\nAll in all, much better pacing. Looking forward to seeing what comes next.",

In previous seasons SAO has taken the opportunity to give fans the middle finger during the last third of the first season and hinge the first part of the second season on a MacGuffin that even the worlds worst detective should have figured out. This season however, has no real FU moment in it. Is the plot contrived? Yes it is; are emotional character moments somewhat schmaltzy? Yes they are. But if you like stories that lean towardsextravagant and melodramatic, I think this is the best iteration of SAO so far. It does not stand on it's own, so I wouldn't recommend it without watching the others, But overall I found it to be an enjoyable watch. Rating 7.8",

Brings nothing new to the table. The definition of mediocre.\r\nMore in depth for those interested:\r\nStory - the idea is good but the way the anime putit was really bland and it quickly became uninteresting and boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt - the art is the only really decent part about the anime. The animation art style is really pretty. Although the animations are definitely not impressive and it becomes just a slide show after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - lackluster. Not a lot of attention payed to it. The music is put in the worst moments ever and it isn't great at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - the worst part. Most boring ass characters in an anime period. The only interesting character is Administrator because she is the only one that is somewhat smart and devilish, which makes her interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - it was pretty good in the first half but then it became bleh but I still had the feeling of duty to finish the anime...",

What are we even doing here?\r\nHonestly I could write an essay that exceeds a thousand words on how mediocre Sword Art Online Alicization is, but I\u2019ll save you the headache. \r\nIn short, SAO\u2019s biggest flaw is its dialogue. Asides from the 5 minute long info dump we had at the start of the season, not a single piece of dialogue has interested me, which in turns leads to the story being stale.\r\nCharacters are boring. Just cutout good guys versusa cutout villain and pitiful enemies. Alice is a plot device, Eugeo is the most stupidly simple character we\u2019ve seen in Sword Art Online so far and Kirito is.. Still overdramatic and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to highlight a motive it would be the reoccuring discussion regarding good and evil. However, instead of actually using this theme and incorporating it into its world they just create a bunch of standard bad guys, who are obviously evil, and then add a lot of pseudo-intellectual dialogue, which has absolutely no meaning. \\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the action scenes have went from the best part about Sword Art Online to a disaster. The fight scenes are not engaging at all, and they feel sluggish. It\u2019s as if they suddenly tried to add a sense of realism.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is honestly bad. However, I will (reluctantly) not give it a score lower than a four. The art is fine and the music is great, as much as I hate to admit it.

            "content": "So another season of SAO is airing and the whole community is up in arms once again, especially people who hated the other seasons as they are salivating at the thought of tearing into some low hanging fruit.\r\nThis season starts with a pretty good hook, a 50-ish minute episode to start things off that has consistent pacing and good world building? Well it's the old tale of A-1 pictures start off the show well and then come tumbling down, but I don't think it has yet. Kirito is back in a new world and we're not being hit over the head with this is somenew MMO and it's revolutionary spiel quite yet. In fact I think it's great no reference to the outside world is made or the rest of the cast. Kirito treats it as though this world is once he's lived in since birth and there is some fairly forced exposition dumping by Kirito's friends. We learn that the characters live in a small, there is another part of the world called the dark territory a place filled with monsters and that their whole world is governed by something called the Taboo Index which lists laws all of them highly punishable. So Kirito and his friends go on an adventure and ends terribly for them. (I don't want to detail out all the events).\\n\\n\r\nSo once out of this we're treated to a scene of GGO, with the whole cast back. This is obviously to set up some later side story as they are not very subtle with anything in the show. For once it seems like the girls in the show are not limited to exclaiming how great Kirito-kun is every 2 seconds and have some dialogue reminiscent of actual people and not cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nLater on the intro of the show is finally addressed, some new VR technology is being created and of course Kirito is right in the centre of it. He is working part-time testing the new technology, which apparently uses the human soul to create a dream like affect in the game, the weird part is he has no recollection of what happens in the game. If any of that is sounds like the most lobotomised pseudo science there is, well you're not wrong. I had flashbacks of Bunny Girl Senpai and when they start talking about God and science in Donnie Darko, but in that at least some of the characters address the retardation. The biggest problem is not the fact souls are brought up in the discussion and their location on the body, it's that after a 5 minute conversation everyone is experts on the topic.\\n\\n\r\nSo later on it's mentioned that half of the death gun duo haven't been apprehended yet. This is the spark that causes the inciting incident which I want to leave vague.\\n\\n\r\nThe vast majority of the show takes place within this other world, which is the best part of the show, as soon as they deviate the show comes to a grinding halt. This season is all about the grandeur adventure Kirito and the other main lead Eugeo set off on. This adventure is one of romance as Eugeo desperately wants to find his friend, a girl named Alice who once went against the taboo index and was sentenced to death, this is a good path for the show as I feel like the strongest parts of the series Aincrad and Mother's Rosario both centred on relationships between characters. The show gets this part right as the scale of the show feels very large. As the virtual world moves many times faster than the real world the infamous time skips rear their head. Up to 2 years passes between episodes and it doesn't affect the show in my eyes, the LN already has too much content for the season as apparently it doubles other season's, so stream-lining it whilst keeping the viewer in the know abput important information is key. I found that they revealed information unbeknown to the viewer pretty well during dialogue. I'm sometimes irritated by the fact we see the impact of something before we see the introduction of that thing.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the fights are well animated and executed making actual tension in the scenes, others are pretty horrible. As a couple of the fights include scenes that are dick size contests with swords. Kirito catches on too early that imagination is the key to winning fights, that if you believe you can you will win. It was irritating when this was found out, because you know what this show missed? Power scaling now all the fights are about imagination alone, but some fights do deviate later telling us the equipment used is of course going to change the course of fights.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the fact Kirito's harem isn't constantly increasing through the series, though it's hinted at, instead the Eugeo is given the star role in many situations, allowing us to kind of humanise Kirito who many of us thought was just the typical self insert harem protagonist. The characters in general are well done, however it acts a little bit like a soap opera as in characters who we've watched for a while act out of character at times, which can be painfully jarring. The main villains are probably the worst of the cast being one dimensional and fully evil, but I managed to put it behind and take the show as easy watching and could sit behind my screen screaming at the characters to kill the bad guys, admittedly cringey but enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nI feel as though sounds and art are aboth pretty standard A-1 picture level, but with the addition of some out of place weapon sound effects, nothing to break your enjoyment though.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is going not going to be for the anime elitists who begrudging went through the last two seasons, as I feel like you're limited to a mindset that nothing good can come from this series, how are you supposed to feel anything during a fight scene for example if you hated Kirito, are you going to root for the villain or just be disinterested? \\n\\n\r\nAs the amount of episodes is still ambiguous my feelings are subject to change. Right now I'm looking forward to the rest of the show. I'd give a Rating somewhere between a 6 and a 7.\\n\\n\\n",

It provides enough answers to settle my mind but introduces plots that keep me at suspense. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I deeply am enjoying Sword Art Online: Alicization and has gave me a reason to watch the Sword Art Online series again.",

Rezi Kawahara introduces fresh characters with their own stories tell and adventures to explore while wittingly blurring the lines between MMMORPG and reality to a provocative degree. The anime maintains a sturdy pace throughout the beginning though soon after delves into the nitty gritty of the story and demonstrates many interesting aspects that reminds viewers why they fell in love with SAO in the first place. There's so much depth and personality to characters that are explored to the fullest extent, particularly Eugeo whose struggle is genuineand easy to relate with. In Eugeo we see an individual with flaws and fears that are much like ones humans face in the real world, we get to see him grow into someone courageous and willing to change and confront his insecurities and personal difficulties as he grows to become his best self, the best Eugeo. Kawahara san explores very mature themes and delivers his ideas in the most vivid details imaginable. All in all I find difficulty in finding any criticism towards the Alicization arc. A masterpiece yet to taste its complete potential. What is a human being? What is life? What is god? What is life? This sword art online, ceaselessly asking the questions you wanna ask. I particularly enjoyed the ending theme song and the ones in between. The animators also demonstrated their talents in the Sword arts and other fighting techniques. SAO: Alicization leaves nothing to be desired.",

But even if you didn't enjoy the previous Arcs of SAO I without a doubt believe you may enjoy this one. \r\nAnyways, I really enjoyed the story, it's a bit different from the other Arcs but it's still really enjoyable. In my opinion, I believe that the first few episodes were the ones story wise, and even though it kind of slowed down in the middle, the ending was just... wow... ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) In the end,the entire story was overall pretty good.\\n\r\nI've always enjoyed the Art style of SAO, so this new Arc shouldnt be an exception. You have to admit that SAO has some quality 60 FPS fight scenes and one of the greatest styles out there in the anime industry. \\n\r\nThe same thing applies for the soundtrack, I love LiSA and all of the anime openings she is a part of, and this first OP is without a doubt my favorite from the whole SAO franchise. The second OP was alright and both the endings were also alright in my opinion. \\n\r\nEven though a lot of people tend to despise the SAO characters, I'm once again a huge fan of them. I enjoyed seeing some of the familiar faces and I especially came to like all the new characters-\\n\r\nIn the end, I rate this anime a solid 9/10, not just because Im an SAO fanboy, but because this Arc is really enjoyable! Give it a go lads! <3",

            "content": "TL;DR: Alicization is not the best SAO. It's not even fucking close.\r\nDon't get me wrong. SAO is an okay series. I've been a fan of the SAO light novels for a while. Of course, the first one was pretty bad, but they gradually got better and better, until they left me at tears during the conclusion of Alicization. It took ten years for Reki Kawahara to finalize the entire arc, and it was one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a while, if you just ignore the plot holes and terrible justifications for certain events.\r\nBut the anime really doesn't live up to standards,and that's a central problem we see in anime adaptations of light novels: either they try to squeeze in as much as possible and leave important things out, or they completely go off on a tangent and ruin the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10 (spoilers, duh.)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people have already covered the plot, so I'll point out a few important things and their light novel comparisons.\\n\\n\r\n1- The set up to Alicization was equally bad in both the anime and the light novel, giving shallow interpretations on what the Soul Translator really was and conveniently setting up Kirito's brain injury at the right time and place. Also assuming that this things can fix Jesus-kun by putting him in a little metal box and shoving his mind into the Underworld. \\n\\n\r\n2- The tree is basically the antagonist for the first few episodes, but in the novel, it actually gets a decent story that fuels Kirito's sword's powers. The abilities to Enhance Armament and Release Recollection are actually rooted in the origins of the swords, but Kirito in the light novel emphasizes the fact that he chopped down the tree that the sword was made from and thus has a bond with it. Points to the light novel for at least trying to explain Jesus-kun's bullshittery at the final fight; none to the anime, because the Fanatio fight was disappointing and so unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\n3- Eugeo's character development was a letdown. It was completely scrapped so we could see more Kirito. And the latter isn't really developing, either. But in the light novel, we are given one or two chapters in the point of view of Charlotte (the spider) and a couple from Eugeo, which makes him more likeable and creates attachment to his character. The anime is rushed, because it's trying to cram everything into one little season, but it feels drawn out because most of that is dialogue.\\n\\n\r\n4- A lot of the fights attempt to mimic the light novels and put in a lot of talking, which backfires because it makes them long and boring. Take the fight with Volo, for example: it didn't serve any purpose. They skip over Kirito's training completely, and don't even show Eugeo half the time. Kirito somehow manages to defeat him because of \"the power of friendship\" trope we love to see (at least it was kinda different) and you could just as easily have skipped it. Meanwhile in the novels, the fight meant someting to Liena-senpai and inspired her to kick his ass.\\n\\n\r\n5- The sexual assault plot device was stupid in both novel and anime, but having to actually listen to it in the anime was pretty much earrape. Also stupid in both was the flower regrowing part; it isn't explained at all. Apparently the author never took middle school biology.\\n\\n\r\n6- In the anime, Alice is now a tsundere and acts like a six-year old rebelling from her parents, because she technically is. In the light novel, she doesn't just readily accept what Kirito says based on \"a feeling in my heart.\" Because she's not an idiot. Rather, like Bercouli, she kind of rationalizes it, and begrudgingly sides with Kirito for the good of the nation.\\n\\n\r\n7- Actually, the anime pretty much explains why Alice doesn't want to heal her eye right away. In the light novel, it's implied that some random headmaster has more powerful magic than a goddamn Integrity Knight. Bonus points to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n8- Dammit, Eugeo should have used Core Protection when he fucked the Administrator. No, the anime completely screwed this one up. Just like with Alice's acceptance of the cold truth after literally living a lie for several years, he readily accepts the fact that no one will ever love him, without resisting in any way. This is why side characters actually serve a purpose in good stories. By the way, in the light novel, there's actually a valid reason for everyone to fight Administrator.\\n\\n\r\n9- Oh, Eugeo is an integrity knight and has telekinesis now. Bercouli has it too, blah blah blah, it's totally overpowered and makes Eugeo look like a badass. Haha, bet he's not going to use it ever again, just like all those overpowered Naruto jutsus. Then Alice clearly sees that something happened to buff Eugeo but allows Kirito's senes of pride to overrule his own safety. It's obvious that Kirito's got thick plot armor and he knows it.\\n\\n\r\n10- Eugeo in the anime is basically a carbon copy of Kirito, but the light novel focuses on how Eugeo's synthesis has created a rift between them and further adding to Eugeo's (minimal) character development. Dammit, give the guy some fucking screentime!\\n\\n\r\n[Episode 20 Checkpoint]\\n\\n\r\n11- The magic system in this world was unexplained by the anime. The gravity of Chudelkin's magic is extremely undermined, as most people can only discharge one element per appendage. For most people, it is their arms or hands. For knights, it is their fingers. Chudelkin, however, manages to hit 12. This would have been a record if Administrator wasn't able to control the Sword Golem at 30.\\n\\n\r\n12- Worldbuilding was poor. Adminstrator's real goal was to sacrifice human lives in order to perfect her sword golem art; one life per sword, although it's not really explained how that works. In the anime, she takes a piety module, sticks it in there, and voila.\\n\\n\r\n13- Charlotte is actually a very likeable character in the light novels. Kirito cries at her death, but in the anime, he's only seen her once. Also, her death is a lot more painful than it seems. \\n\\n\r\n14- Episode 22: \"You should have gone for the head.\" -Thanos\\n\\n\r\n15- The dialogue is getting really annoying now, because Administrator is conveniently not attacking while the main characters are discussing, although that might be alluding to the arrogance of Administrator, who is a heartless fuck.\\n\\n\r\n16- Holy fuck, if only I could combine episode 23 in the anime with the same scene. Both are just meager on their own, but if you take the setup in the light novels and apply it to the way the anime is executed, this would be perfect. Administrator is now a decent villain. Cardinal is annoying at first but manages to do the right thing once. Eugeo becomes a decent side character. In the twenty-minute run time in which everything happens, there is a lot of things that are not said directly. The prototype sword golem doesn't really make sense, but all you need to know is that 1 sword = 1 human and 1 golem manipulation = 1 memory module. Kirito's not a bad friend by not stopping Eugeo; he's forced to accept Eugeo's choice. Alice isn't crying over Cardinal because she's sad, but because she's basically lost hope, and regains it due to Eugeo giving them a chance by cutting off Administrator's arm. The Eugeo sword is completed with young Alice's piety module which is drawn to Eugeo because he is the person in it that \"she desires most,\" and it has wings because of their desire to be free. The sword continues to fly on its own after Cardinal dies because she gives it her final order before that.\\n\\n\r\n17- Jesus powers have returned. Dammit.\\n\\n\r\n18- Damn, Alicization has hit a new high. Eugeo infuses his essence into the sword which makes it red. Kirito gets his old coat back because why not (for some reason, it also happens to Sinon later) and the scene where Eugeo and Alice walk away really hit me in the feels. Everything actually pieces together here: Administrator used Chudelkin but he was the one who prevented her from escaping to the real world. Eugeo knew that Kirito had gotten \"attached\" to the real Alice and that they would eventually fight about which one should inhabit her body, although technically the modules are just memories and Alice wouldn't really disappear but rather merge. What Rath is trying to do is speed up the rate of time in the Underworld to give Kirito more time to send Alice back up to the real world, and they're sending Asuna to help in a specially prepared god account.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the one saving grace of this entire anime. The battle scenes, however, start to waver in quality between epic and fucking terrible. There's a bit more gore here than the previous SAO seasons, but not to a ridiculous extent.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, everyone still looks like the same person and it's just Kirito with different hair colors or genders. But considering the fact that this came from A-1 Pictures, the characters are somewhat distinguishable. It still doesn't give them any depth, though.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is great, and this would have been a solid 9/10 if not for the fucking rape scene. If you thought it was hard to watch, imagine listening to it. \\n\\n\r\nAs standalone anime songs, Resister is fucking great. Adamas is pretty good, too. But the openings themselves are just okay. Maybe on par with Innocence, or maybe Ignite.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nKirito is the same old nice guy, but this time, he's covered in even more plot armor and has to rebuild his harem from scratch. Don't worry, though, they'll come back in due time. He's still got his Jesus powers, and he still wears all black because he's an edgy teen. He does some things that are unexpected, but not in a good way - for example, he cries over Cardinal but doesn't even tear up when Eugeo dies.\\n\\n\r\nMost of Eugeo's character development is sacrificed so you can see Kirito doing cool stuff, which makes Eugeo seem like a dumbass and lessens the impact of all of his actions. He's basically a carbon copy of Kirito. Then he comes back because \"the power of friendship\" and there's really no depth in his betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nAlice is your average tsundere, who says \"I'll kill you after ______\" a lot in one episode, then immediately skips to \"Hold me tight\" in the next one. She's kind of stupid, considering the fact that she accepts Kirito's reasoning without any protest. But she's also pretty noble, because she offers to sacrifice herself to give her body back to the original Alice, and she becomes somewhat likeable, at least until she's literally shown to be a replacement waifu for Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nAdministrator is basically a typical yandere, but without any particular man to obsess over. Her facial expressions, however, can bring you back to painful recollections of \"don't pause anime\" memes. She's a half decent villain, and would be a pretty good one if her motives and reasoning was explained soundly enough. Unfortunately, this is SAO we're talking about, so no.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else is pretty irrelevant and rather hard to remember, simply because their character can be summed up in a few words. Examples:\\n\\n\r\nChudelkin - Administrator's bitch\\n\r\nBercouli - overpowered grandpa\\n\r\nFanatio - hates being a girl\\n\r\nLinel & Fizel - beware of lolis\\n\r\nCardinal - lolis are okay, i guess\\n\r\nDeusolbert - stormtrooper aim\\n\r\nEldrie - enjoys whipping young boys in the middle of the night\\n\r\nRonye & Tiese - a bad plot device\\n\r\nVolo - \"YOU SOILED MY SHIRT, NOW WE SHALL DUEL\"\\n\r\nLiena - likes flowers i guess\\n\r\nSelka - basically a plot device for giving Kirito his Jesus powers back\\n\\n\r\nCompare this to the light novel:\\n\\n\r\nChudelkin - typical obsessive pervert\\n\r\nBercouli - such a cool grandpa\\n\r\nFanatio - btw I'm pregnant\\n\r\nLinel & Fizel - don't worry, Kirito will teach you RESPECC\\n\r\nCardinal - a brave legal loli\\n\r\nDeusolbert - Katniss Everdeen, but she's using autofire\\n\r\nEldrie - cares a lot for Alice's wellbeing because she is his senpai\\n\r\nRonye & Tiese - typical damsels in distress who are just harem bait\\n\r\nVolo - \"YOU SOILED MY SHIRT, NOW WE SHALL DUEL\"\\n\r\nLiena - a good senpai noble who doesn't discriminate\\n\r\nSelka - Alice's sister who idolizes her\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Administrator and Cardinal stand out from the rest of the cast because they actually serve some sort of purpose in the anime. However, the light novels do this much better and thus I can't help but feel disappointed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be quite honest, I have enjoyed watching Alicization until now. It's a nice weekend anime with some good qualities, and some nice moments. It's very nice to look at, and provides a new view on certain things.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, from the point of view of a critic, there are so many things wrong with this anime that I could completely understand if certain people don't like it that much. And the thing with anime adaptations is that they are squeezed out in 20-minute episodes. So the smaller side characters with chapters probably won't have a chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, one of the key points of the light novels is the internal monologue and external interactions of the characters. When the anime tries to adapt this, it either condenses the speech and puts in a decent deal of action (SAO), gives up on dialogue and capitalizes on action (SAO II), or tries to do both and ends up completely failing (Alicization). The interesting part about the fights is the speech, but the extensive dialogue is exactly why they are so boring.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it still stands that SAO is one of the most popular anime franchises of all time, and the fact that I enjoyed the light novel version of Alicization so much is also what compels me to see it all come to life in an anime. But for anyone expecting a revival of the greatness of SAO in this third season, this isn't what you're looking for.\\n\\n\r\nGo read the light novels. You'll have a lot more fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps.",

            "content": "I will skip the summary since if you are reading this you've probably watched few episodes. \r\nThis season inherited pretty much most of the problems commonly criticised for first two seasons and I am seriously wondering how a studio could learn absolutely no lesson from its previous mistakes. The fact that the fanbase is overwhelmingly positive about both seasons really doesn't help, if you really want SAO to improve, then admit its flaws. \r\n1. Setting:\r\nSword Art Online is incredibly poor in explaining its world setting. Now being a show that centred around a virtual reality, it is truly a skill to deliver essential information pertainingto its world setting while not making the audience feel bored. However, what SAO does every single season is minute-long conversation, which mostly happened in a cafe, and tried to explain its setting from Kirito(or someone else)'s mouth. This show starts off throwing a bunch of terminology at you: soul translator, fluctlight, Brain machine interface, Mnemonic visual data, RATH, full dive system and etc, etc. And I am pretty sure 99% of the audience could not remember any of these terms after several episodes. Now other cyberpunk shows like psycho-pass explained essential information as the plot progress and during a mission in the first episode. Attack on titan explained its world setting after a visual impact right in the first episode, after the audience is hooked, then proceed to explain the world setting. That is how a good world setting introduction should be whereas in SAO, it is simply explained in conversation, do you see how this is a very poor way to deliver essential information? Now it is third season and they never changed it. It's like seeing two people walking in a circle for half of the episode in fate/zero, the difference is in SAO, it happened literally every season. \\n\\n\r\n2. Time skip:\\n\r\nThis is really a very cheap plot progression tool when studio and/or writer doesn't know what to write next. Sometimes it is really effective while other times this is simply garbage writing. In SAO, it is the latter. An essential key to successful time skip is when the audience KNOW or get an overall understanding of what happened in this period of time. I'll take the two year time skip in One piece as an example, one piece explained what each member is doing during this period show luffy's training, in order to avoid repetition, Oda chose to time skip two years and yet audience never felt this is rushed or inappropriate because they KNOW what happened in these two years. Now back to SAO, also two years of time skip, we don't know how Kirito and eugeo got the city, how did they trained and what happened during their travel, none of these were even hinted. Did I forget to mention that in previous episode, travelling to the city is described as something difficult and kirito needs eugeo to accompany him? and yet the show didn't even attempt to elaborate on that. \\n\\n\r\n3. Overpowered protagonists\\n\r\nSpeaking of time skip, there are places where I feel time skip is necessary. Do you remember when Kirito meets Eugeo, he was trying to cut down a tree as his calling, or more understandably, his job.  The tree was introduced as tough, the fact is that it took seven generations to only cut through less then one percent of its duration. And then after a fight with goblin, they are able to take down the tree that took seven generations to cut through barely one percent. At least they could have showed some training of Eugeo and Kirito and time skipped a little instead of having the tree destroyed after a single try. It is so ridiculous it hurts, and honestly after the moment the tree is introduced I know this is gonna happen, no joke here, this is what SAO always like, Kirito could never lose. In that goblin fight I am glad to see kirito at least showed some effort in defeating his opponent and yet in the next scene it is as if the fight never happened. The fight had no effect whatsoever on the plot or character development, it is simply a plot device in order to make kirito capable of cutting down the tree, although it still seems stupid and out of no where. \\n\r\nKirito had a fight with Volo, first of all, the conflict between Volo and Kirito is so forced (Kirito accidentally splits mud on volo's suit) but its another story. The problem there is no tension. In SAO you can not feel any tension in fights since you know Kirito can not lose no matter how powerful his opponent is described to be. Kirito simply stands there and shout out loud that he can not lose, and suddenly becomes powerful. Not to mention the entire fight was like 5 mins with inner thoughts and meaningless dialogues account for half of the time. \\n\\n\r\n4. Antagonist and rape scene\\n\r\nI will not be gentle on this one, Kawahara is not good at building a good antagonist at all, not even decent. Now if you want to build a good antagonist, the most important thing is to make sure that the conflict between protagonist and antagonist logically make sense. In first season we see a sadistic programmer who didn't even know why he massacred so many people and a elf-like crazy guy who only wanted to sexually assault and turned a cry baby once defeated. In this season, we have two guys who wanted to rape Eugeo's girl. Now allow me to ask a question, why did these two shits wanted to have a conflict with Eugeo and Kirito on the first place? The thing is, if you want to create a conflict, make sure you rationalise that conflict, don't make it come out of nowhere. Fans of SAO say it's the society that caused these two guys act like crazy, then how to do you account for all the good guys in UW? Did we see any character background from the yellow and grey guy at all? There is none, and it makes the conflict so stupid and contrived, you see the problem isn't yellow and grey haired guys are crazy, the problem is that they are not real human, they exist for the sake of being bad guys, there is no human aspects of these two assholes (same applied to the elf-guy in ALO). And then of course, the only way how SAO can progress with its god awful plot is having female raped in front of Protagonist, and thus Eugeo opens his Sharingan. Once is acceptable, twice could be an coincidence, but three times and once in every single season? Allow me to speculate the mental condition of the writer, the fact is, rape is just a low and stupid way to progress plot, It's not that I am fragile and not Okay with rape, I don't even feel anything for the raped girls because of the overuse. Remember this is not game of throne, even in GoT, rape is never used as a way to move plot. You know how I would write this? It could be that kirito is injured by two assholes and Eugeo tried to protect Kirito, it could result in the exact same conclusion while weakening Kirito's gary stu status. And yet the writer choose to use \"rape\" over and over again and SAO fans are excited about it. Really, SAO fanbase is the most bizarre fanbase I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nYou see all these 4 points not only happened in this season, but previous season as while, further indicating that A1 literally learned no lesson from previous mistake. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention SAO:A 's pacing is even worse then first two seasons'. 14 episodes and nothing substantial really happened, SAO and other arcs are concluded by now, but it's reasonable since the original SAO:A LN is like several books. \\n\\n\r\nIn this season introduced Eugeo, I mean Kirito with different hair color. After finishing the first ten episodes, I could not find any word to describe his personality whatsoever other then he is little shy compared to Kirito, I don't think he can settle on any defining personality at all.And We knew no personal background story on him.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I personally think this season is better than first two (although there is not a really comparison to be made, it's like comparing two bad shows where one is slightly better),  No matter what good inheritance the first season and SAO's premise left, what is bad remains bad, and people will eventually realise that. \\n\\n\r\nBtw, if you are trying to say \"read LN, it's better\". I don't care, LN could be good but it doesn't change the fact SAO anime adaptation is train wreck.",

I'm not Hater or Fan, i just watch anime, read light novel, manga to relax. \r\nMaybe Aincrad Arc and Phamtom Bullet Arc is terrible, but Alicization Arc is not. The Story is a real journey and bloody fight, fight for thing that they belive , don't get up and still fight to last breath (you'll see in this cour) . Maybe that thing need in Aincrad Arc, not over power main character and boring figh although have a little bit romance from  previous seasons but still good. A New Storyline have realjourney that i expected from season 1 (8/10)\\n\r\nAbout A-1 Pics. Of course SAO will help A-1 make a big profit. So they will pay or rent a good staff and budget. This is why art this season is better than the previous seasons but still have some fail art. But background is very good tho ( 8/10 )\\n\r\nSound is a reason why i interested. Maybe they not good about Art or how to express details but the one thing make i really like this studio is Music: Op, Ed and Original Soundtrack is so great, hyped and SAO is no exceptions. New Ending \"Forget-me-not\" by ReoNa is very meaningful in this cour and sadness when i heard. About Op didn't make me dissaponted. Original soundtrack is still dope like every single anime have made by A-1. (10/10)\\n\r\nMost prominent character is Eugeo, he play the role for storyline from begining to Ending this arc. Not like other over power main character. He try very hard to geting stronger to find childhood friend (Alice). He always think for everyone, fight for what he belive although he can be killed. That is one of character make this season to be good (8/10)\\n\r\nLike what i write in the top. I watch anime to relax. i don't care hater or fan (9/10)\\n\r\nOverall. 9.1/10\\n\r\nThis arc Alicization is a good arc so far",

Watching Alicization was like watching something conpletely different than the other seasons. Watching anime isn't for reviewing or sharing, but its dor the enjoyment. Instead of picking out the negatives and comparing it to other anime, why not just sit back and try to enjoy it. Don't like it? Stop watching it maybe it's not your type. Sword Art Online embodies this. As an anime that gets an adaptation straight from the light novels theres going to be a few problems. But SAO may not be thatdedicated anime fan show. It can be that show that introduces people into anime. Overpowered charcters that always win is not always a bad thing.

            "content": "Another SAO franchise has ended......the 1st cour that is , cu'z by October another cour will begin, and this time Asuna would be back (I think). So far, this franchise never gets old and it wasn't something that one should be bore of. Ok so this time around Kirito is back in some virtual world in what is now called Full-Dive technology known as \"Soul Translator\", or STL, pretty much different from the couple of SAO worlds, but only this time, he finds himself being in a virtual world as a necessity to save his life after encountering Johnny Black, successor of Death Gun whosucceeds in injecting Kirito with a poison syringe. A poison syringe , really? I would have preferred the scenario,where Kirito and Asuna where going home but they've found out that there is someone following them and threatened to kill both of them and yes it's  Johnny Black, the two tried to get away, but the guy gave chase, so in a dark corner Kirito waits for Johnny Black and stabbed him in the abdomen with an iron bar that Kirito found laying around , but Johnny has a gun was able to shoot Kirito in the head, but lucky for him he's still alive to be brought to the hospital, but it left Kirito comatose , while Johnny Black died from loosing a lot of blood from the stabbed wound that Kirito inflicted on him for self defends, that would have been a better start... too bad original creator  Kawahara, Reki has to to come up with something corny to put the character in such a predicament. Give that this is a new SAO, only the main character Kirito has to remain and the rest of the cast from the previous SAO franchise have to be regulated as support characters like Asuna and the others. Here it is now Eugeo who replaces Asuna as Kirito's partner and from there the new journey begins where the mission was to get Alice back after she ventures to the \"Dark Territory,\" so without any more BS, here are my ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory- Very Good 8: It has a new start, new characters and still the same MC Kirito in the helm and a new set of antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Mediocre 5: Cu'z things were still the same from the previous SAO franchise and btw don;t expect to see any good raped NTR scene being done to Tiese and Rione and also  Quinella fanservice sucks. cu'z you won't be seeing any nipples nor a hairy pussy. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Good 7: That's for the 3rd ending theme \"forget-me-not\" by ReoNa.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Very good 8: Since Kirito still has that hero thing that he has from the previous SAO franchise and with the addition of Eugeo and Alice ( in later eps) adds to the the buildup and having a main antagonist like Quinella removes any boredom of enjoying this anime especially when you see how she ends and yep in the hands of her perverted lackey Chudelkin. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Very Good 8: there are no words for me to say about this anime, other than the rating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Very Good 8: Can't wait for the next cour. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Selfish people are still selfish they always point out the bad facts and figures in everything they don't see good things in them because they don't have eyes to see or don't have aheart to understand it. It's like they have been given a duty to point out many bad facts as they can so they will be rewarded for completing the job.\\n\\n\r\nSAO Alicization:\\n\\n\r\n1. Art: The art of SAO is always been good if we talk about SAO's previous seasons according to there airing time as compare to other anime.\\n\r\nPerhaps (I said \"perhaps\" because Shingeki no Kyojin's art has a match for SAO.) the best anime as for the art in currently airing anime. The light effects with the peaceful scenery always feels good by watching it. The art of SAO: Alicization feels kind of real.\\n\\n\r\n2. Sound: The soundtracks and songs of SAO are always good and always be good.\\n\r\nA. Songs:\\n\r\nThe first time when I watch SAO: Alicization's first opening it wasn't impressive for me but as the time pass the episodes passed, hearing it again and again finally I loved it, so as for generally speaking I say the song rating should be 7-8/10 (but for me the song rating is 10/10). When the second opening came I didn't even liked it just because I was sad that first opening is gone (I know who are reading should say, \"is that even a reason?\") but that's not it! When that version of the second opening in the Episode 21 came I was like, \"Which is the best opening of Alicization opening 1 or 2??\" it is funny for me now when ever I think about it. As for the endings both are my favorites from the first day because it is based on Eugeo's tragic life and I love his story (I mean the story of Eugeo who passes through suffering and the pain of injustice found a person who taught him to fight for your people you love).\\n\r\nB. Soundtracks:\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are one of the biggest reason why I always give SAO 10/10. Here I specially want to mention the Episode 16 of SAO: Alicization when Kirito and Eugeo fight against Alice at the \"Cloudtop Garden\" that time the soundtracks are insanely settled with the epic scene or should I say the most coolest scene of SAO: Alicization so far.\\n\r\nAnd also the sad musics which touches the heart in order to understand the situation in the scenes which I think can only be in great creations.\\n\\n\r\n3. Story:\\n\r\nThe story of Alicization shows a new game which is very different from the previous games in SAO series. In this game when a person dive in he/she becomes totally disconnected from the real world like he/she is in a dream (so we can say the Project Alicization is a project is to make a dream game) which is very interesting for me at-least because I am a gamer and a programmer of AI. If you heared the name of a story ALICE in wonderland (A Disney movie is also made on this story and it is one of my most favorite Disney movie since my childhood) you wil see the resemblance in there. SAO Alicization's story is mainly based on Eugeo's life how he lost ALICE in an accident and then found Kirito to help him to bring her back. And as for Kirito he always been in trouble and helping different people. Now Kirito is helping Eugeo, and why exactly he is helping Eugeo is to get information about the game to get out of there, but as the time passed he is getting more in the game and forgetting his real purpose and that is because of some people specially Eugeo and ALICE.\\n\\n\r\n4. Characters:\\n\r\nThe two new characters ALICE and Eugeo are very very good. ALICE and Eugeo who supposed to be like AI fluctlights have a mind like real humans. Other characters in Alicization are \\n\r\nvery good but not so impressive.\\n\r\nA. ALICE:\\n\r\nALICE is my most favorite character of Alicization and the SAO series (you can see her in my top 10 character list) so far because her personality is very impressive the way she talk, the getup, the fighting style, her weapon (Osmanthus blade), her spirit and thoughts and everything about her is as is should be. ALICE is shown over powered and I like that fact that she is over powered. The reason why I think she should be over powered because we don't have any over powered characters since the first season of SAO. But some audience of SAO: Alicization doesn't like ALICE due to she is over powered (than there favorite character I guess).\\n\r\nB. Eugeo:\\n\r\nEugeo is my second favorite in SAO: Alicization he is innocent, kind, loving, caring, spirited and great swords man as Kirito who fight for good. The biggest fact in Eugeo is, he has complete sense of humanity.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAbout enjoyment it is more enjoyably season then the previous seasons because it has cliffhanger in \"every episode\" which is not there before!\\n\\n\\n\r\n6 Overall:\\n\r\n10/10 as a gamer, a programmer and an anime lover!",

            "content": "SAO: Alicization (or SAO season 3), started with a right foot on first few episodes.  And we all fall for this marketing hook, SAO mid season become so boring to watch it is dreadfull even to waste your time on this anime... Really just don't watch it, mark my words!!! You won't regret it, as I did.\r\nI am 27 years old man, and I would even dare to say, that even teenagers would not enjoy SAO... It's totally garbage, when you make all 50 episodes about climbing a single 100 floor tower, which what this anime is all about... Kirito has become a child...Srsly he is now a child... It's like Watching Dragon Ball Z, later you think Dragon Ball GT will be even better, but you understand that MC Goku transformed from adult into a child... Which is so lame to watch, this series are hitting pit bottom really soon among mid-old audiences...\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me totally wrong here, that I am a hater or anything like that, I enjoyed season 1 and Gun Gale Online too, they were kind of ok'ish to watch. Introducing a fairy AI was like Jar Jar Binks in Star wars, and the MC villain just - well lets just say he didn't had any emotions or strong motivation to build SAO in first place, which kind of makes him dull and very easy to forget, that this guy even existed... And Gun Gale Online, didn't had anything I didn't like, but Gun Gale was a bit too late to release its series and didn't bring anything new on TV table at that moment for audiences to watch and consume...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 50 episodes about 100th floor tower gets 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy so low you ask? Well, when fighting is happening between 4  grey walls, in closed space, and I mean majority of battles is in closed space. There is no beautiful places, only grey walls in the background. Producers and authors were very lazy on season 3, It cannot even be compared to season 1. The first few episodes of season 3 were kind of interesting, as they were introducing new concepts, but when you put a few drops of honey on a pile of sh*t, it doesn't make it sweeter... And this tower climbing never ends, like the Ancient Greek legend Sisyphus, never ending rolling to the mountain. Plot becomes really obvious, even if you didn;t read LN. And Kirito's goal of this anime become not saving his life like in the first episodes he concluded, but to save all this non existing Virtual world without any'ish casualties... \\n\\n\r\nArt gets 5/10\\n\r\nArt is very hard concept to discuss, so I will just skip it and say its average, it's what the least quality you would expect from famously titled SAO\\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10\\n\r\nThey were kind of good on first episodes, where was the most interesting part of season 3. But later you become too much familiar to the same sounds, so they kind of becoming a part of the problem - they are becoming boring to listen and I believe they are taken from older seasons like season 1  or 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10 there are only 2 MC here Kirito and Eugeo: \\n\\n\r\nKirito becomes a child, he even acts like a child sometimes, especially naive, even though he is almost 30 years old!?! Really creators??? It's so unnatural instead of becoming older to become younger... If old man becomes a child, he would still act as an old man, he wouldn't disregard his life experiences and seriousness... \\n\\n\r\nEugeo, well he is like a Pinocchio, he decided to become a real human being... Well I kind of understand now, why author would create an AI fairy cheater in season 1, so they could turn Eugeo into a real boy in season 3...  And its not a spoiler, it's totally my speculation...\\n\\n\r\nWhat is sad to watch, that Kiritos friends aren't with him in this season too. Even his wife, maybe will join him on last episodes of season 3, but I was expecting her to join way sooner, instead she is chilling drinking tea with science team, while Kirito is barely winning his fights, and because he is saving the world without any casualties, he simply cannot die or get injured enough to abandon this naive childish thinking of saving the world thingy. This world doesn't even exist in a first place, and new thousands of worlds could be destroyed and recreated in different computers at the same time... So really Kirito should focus on his ,god dammit, - life saving goal and get out of this world ASAP, before he gets killed or perishes together with the world... \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nYou will enjoy first few episodes, but after that you will feel hoaxed, and drop this crap like I did, there are way bigger fishes to watch in this huge Earth of ours...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nDon't watch it, its a trap! You will regret latter if you do!!! Don't say I didn't warn you\\n\\n\r\nWhat else you could watch besides SAO? Gen:Lock, Shield Hero. Cya ;)",

            "content": "Sword Art Online Alicization is 4-cour.... That's right, 4-cour. Instead of adapting an a terrible show, \"They\" decided to take this more seriously. SAO Alicization being 4-cour means there will be less time skip and quality world-building. Not only that, it is likely that the story of the show will be given more focus or else a 4-cour adaptation wouldn't be necessary.\r\nWith that in mind, I speculate that it's going to be better than the other seasons of SAO. Though I haven't finished the whole thing yet, the first cour makes it seems promising.\r\n------(Some Spoilers Ahead)------\r\nFirst Cour Review\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story-telling is great. It's more in-depth,and there's a reason for events instead of using plot convenience, so it felt more enjoyable. Focus is put onto world-building in the first few episode but there's also action, they managed to put together the first few episode in a constructive manner, explaining the world to the audience without Kirito being all-knowing while delivering sufficient action to capture the audience's attention. \\n\\n\r\nKirito is given 2 years to train, and he didn't actually become immortal plot armor god through that. He is still weak even after that and have to retreat in some of the fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is very high quality, especially during fight scenes. The color is vibrant and gives a fantasy vibes to the show\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nThe Opening songs is great as usual since it is sang by LISA, it is memorable and decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending song is also quite good. The songs feel sad and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nThis time around, there's no harem for Kirito.... I know, sounds impossible but it happened. Kirito instead is partnered with Eugeo, a male character with a lot more screen time than Klein and actual character development. There's even a girl that fell for Eugeo. Yes... A girl fell for someone else other than Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nKirito also have a slight bit of character development, though a very small amount currently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 7.2/10",

The pacing is too fast, you meet characters that you start to end up caring about in the light novel, but in the anime its just like \"HEY, heres some characters you'll see for 2-3 episodes and NEVER see again!\", and Ihate being the guy thats always like \"the books better than the movies!\" but I am quite disappointed the adaptation, but yet I'm still enjoying it, even with the changes they've made.\\n\\n\r\nIf you never liked SAO then you won't like this. If you do like SAO, or maybe you liked the first season and never watched anymore, then you'll probably like this.",

And some of the settings don't make sense. And Asuna!!! Her screentime!!! \r\n      Overall, I'd give this show a 7. I will keep on watching it.

            "content": "Like others, comparing SAO seasons, I too say this one is probably the best... As of the most current episode, 10, to this review. \r\nMain reasons why I like this season the most: \r\n- Kirito finally has a close male friend that we see with him at all times and is separated from his harem\r\n- holy shit there's so much blood... Well, at least in that one episode, and I love it because to me, it just adds more flavour to this anime and creates the setting of how the rest of it may be\r\nOf course, since the beginning, SAO has shown what kind ofanime they'll be and how their characters, good/bad, will be portrayed, meaning, their personalities will be overemphasized immediately. The 2 main villains thus far are extremely exaggerated, but it still made me hate them with a burning passion, and yet very satisfied when justice was served in this messy way. I personally like how Eugeo's character is developing. We all know how Kirito is, and how OP he may become despite starting from beginning stages of the game and still managing to defeat higher level combatants. I like how Kirito is mentoring Eugeo in swordsmanship and morality. It's more like this season is about Eugeo rather than Kirito, which I'd prefer as Kirito has become the master several times already. \\n\\n\r\nSome things I disliked:\\n\r\n- the main characters do feel a bit bland, probably due to the time skips so we don't see the actual progression in themselves and relations with new characters (the new characters pretty much just appear without intro)\\n\r\n- the main villains so far are extremely exaggerated, also the personalities of others like Volo or later Alice, but then again, this is anime so, it's to be expected... But I still won't prefer it (however, the moment Volo smiled after the exam duel, I was very happy seeing more than just stern and angry faced Volo)\\n\r\n- Kirito's line about having more confidence in your whatever that powers your internal strength/will, will amplify the power to your sword (I just find this very cliche or even cheesy, but it has been similarly like this for other SAO seasons)\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'm gonna be entertained and likely satisfied with the remainder of the season. So far now, up to episode 10, I like it.",

I sort of enjoyed the story behind gun gale and movies (well, it didn't blow my mind or anything, but it was decent for some anime&popcorn evenings) But this series?! Oh my [insert something vulgar] ! From the very beginning of this season I kept telling myself that this show can eventually get better. That something will change. Guess what, apart from 2 maybe 3 scenes throughout the 24 episodes the story development is getting evenmore boring. 70% of a time Eugeo appears as a dumb sidekick whom I could only compare to the Mud from the game called Gothic. The things that happen to the characters are in my opinion poorly explained, and the whole tower rush is so prolonged and silly, that i had to drink a lot of coffee not to fall asleep while watching it. In my opinion this is the worst SAO show so far, but judging by its rating, I guess it also found some enthusiasts, so maybe I am just getting to old :/ \\n\r\nAnyway, if you didn't like the show after first few episodes, don't fool yourself. It doesn't get better :(",

            "content": "Alicization. SAO III. Whatever you want. It's actually not that bad.\r\nStory: This season of SAO is more focused on developing and fleshing out certain parts in the story, rather than having a condensed and rushed version of the source material. This helps it in the long run, allowing for scenes to actually have impact on the story and characters to be developed. However, what this show lacks is that certain aspects of the story that were introduced at the beginning of the show or middle don't seem to carry the relevancy they could have had when getting to the end of the show. For example,our favorite Umu girl, Cardinal, is introduced in the middle of the show, but by the end, becomes irrelevant with her powers by the end. I'm trying not to spoil, but you get the idea. The story itself in this show is much better told than the first 2 seasons, however. I will say that the end of episodes do keep you on the edge, which is always nice assuming that you're invested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this season is a major upgrade from the previous seasons. Shading is done way better, and scenes pop out in color. The battle scenes in the first half to the final of the show are really nicely done (even if Admin feels much different), and everyone's special abilities pop out in how different they are. With the art, I have no actual qualms.\\n\\n\r\nSound: What can I say? Music is nice, character voice acting is well done. Clown boi is creepy like he should be, Eugeo's voice drops as he becomes more and more confident in himself, etc. Everything works as it should.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh boy, this is where it gets a little rough. I do like the improvement that they did in character development, since everyone gets a little something. Kirito uses his intuitive mind and his experience to get through the Underworld skillfully in a way that doesn't seem like complete BS, which always helps the story not feel rushed. Eugeo's character arc is pretty much throughout the entire show, where he slowly gains confidence in himself, then realizes that what he's fighting for isn't for himself. Out of everyone in the show, Eugeo becomes the most likable by the end, even with that one part that I can't talk about. Even still, certain developments in the story are explained with backstory that gives us an actual reason as to why characters do what they do, and that can't be said for certain parts of previous seasons. Aside from the main cast, the side characters do get some development, but not much. In fact, I wish that they would have delved deeper into some of the characters with the time they had. The trainees, Tiese and Ronnie, I would say, are the only exception. They had their arc with Lord Raios, but they also were given backstories that shape their character development, and don't remain static characters. With certain others, such as Kirito and Eugeo's mentors, could have been developed further. With the relationship between the 4, I feel that the setup would have prompted more development between the mentors, but that is one part that's lacking from the show. Sortiliena is an interesting character with an interesting backstory, but that's wasted on progressing the training montage with Kirito and his fights. Speaking of that, the guy he fights with doesn't really get much character for the first \"villain\" of the show. However, overall, with the main characters, this season is definitely the best we've gotten, although I feel the first season did the minor characters better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite the stigma against SAO, this season was solid and held its ground. It had shaky moments, but those were smaller parts within episodes that could easily be remedied by good ol' plot development. Even if side characters could have been developed more, that didn't affect the overall story. In all, I feel that this is a nice season of a show in general, but a great step in the right direction for SAO. It's like Ordinal Scale all over again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Did this season live up to the expectations? Yes and no. The show did well in story when compared to the other seasons, and is a good contender when compared against the best out of all SAO, Ordinal Scale. However, it did lack certain developments of characters that could have been fleshed out even more. Does it deserve the hate that's automatically given due to the name, like GGO Alternative? No, absolutely not. However, what you give this series as a whole, judging by the content alone, is entirely up to you. If you've watched one season of SAO, I recommend this season. If you haven't touched SAO, then this season is still a good watch, but based on the base material needed to understand this season, it'd be a decision that I can't justify nor retract a claim for watching or not. Overall verdict? It's pretty good.",

            "content": "After three series with Kirito, I might be done. The most painful thing about Alicization is that it started off somewhat strong with an interesting idea, but then dissolved into a lot of the same problems I've had in the past:\r\n- The villains are poorly written and their motivations are always clear but never well explained.\r\n- If there is a male villain, there seems to be this tendency for the author to go far overboard with their villainy. I don't know if the author has ever noticed subtleties in good villainous characters. \r\n- Female characters will show strength at times, and then suddenly abandon itto suddenly become an emotional, vulnerable puddle for Kirito to \"fix\".\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures did an amazing job visually. It's gorgeous, for the most part. I'm not sure if they were involved in the decisions behind episode 10, but my opinion of them would drop if they were the ones to decide to include such a depraved plot device rather than change it for something (almost anything, really) better. \\n\\n\r\nI was skipping up to 3 minutes of an episode due to so much useless and boring exposition that offered little to bite into. That's the worst thing: this season has many moments that leave me outright disinterested. Kirito didn't see any development we haven't seen before, so this leaves a lot of focus on some of the new characters and the plot. When I say \"focus\", it's more a lack of focus. When your plot includes graphic assault of multiple characters, at least have the decency to keep those characters around to develop them more. Instead, it's all focus on the plot and \"technology\". It's insulting to the audience and the characters to have these moments that are supposed to absolutely huge and devastating emotionally, only to realize they were simply there to get Characters A and B to Location D.\\n\\n\r\nThe author of this series continues to learn very little about what issues there have been previously. The future of SAO looks grim, full of exposition and very little care for character development or plot-pacing. If you like SAO as it is and always has been, the future looks plenty bright for staying the course, keep the status quo, etc.",

            "content": "It's nice to see all the armchair \"experts\" who bullied kids away from the first two seasons coming back to explain us how one of the most successful anime of the century is actually poorly written, boring, and a threat to world peace.\r\nLuckily, I am no expert at anything: I can freely judge anime by how much I like them, instead of forcing myself to find stuff I don't understand and call it \"poor writing\".\r\nIf you liked the first season (and the second too, but you're too scared of the bullies to say it), you'll probably like Alicization. It weirded me out for a coupleepisodes, because it wasn't at all what I expected (what did I expect? Dunno, but having watched \"Alice and Zoroku\" I was probably looking for a more Alice-y, erm, thing); then it grew on me. It's NOT Sword Art Online: it's a different story with different characters, and it uses SAO as sort of a stepping stone. Because the nth isekai anime would probably be ignored if it wasn't a -supposed- sequel to the one that sold the genre to the general public. \\n\r\nSo, is Alicization any good? Well, I like it. Does it have the same issues SAO had? Don't know, ask the armchair bullies: to me, SAO didn't have any particular defect (insert mouth frothing and cries of RAPE! INCEST! here). Is it entertaining? Yes, definitely.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story: big initial surprise, some meh moments followed, then the story starts and it's good. Unexpected. The \"real life\" parts are useless and just an excuse for pretending it's \"SAO\". Fortunately, until now, there's been a negligible amount of them. 8/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Art: what do you expect, it's SAO. I sort of didn't love the movie, but here the original top polished, perfectly animated art is back. 8/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Sound: ditto. Not as bombastic as the movie: just the right amount of beautiful audio scenery and character. 8/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Character: as in \"characters\"? Good good people, bad bad people, generic generic people; nothing to say - I guess the action puts all these standard personalities in the right place. 7/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Enjoyment: yes. I'm always expecting the next episode, even when the current one isn't \"great\". I find myself wishing for a faster pace, and at the same time wanting a 365-episodes anime. You know, like Bleach, but with an actual story. 8/10\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall: if you hated SAO, or you were bullied into hating it, don't fret: this isn't SAO, you have my permission to watch it XD. If you liked SAO, well, this is an isekai anime with cute characters, awesome fights, a little introspection (sadly, much less serious themes than in SAO), stupidly good art and sound, and a compelling story. Like it! 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy isn't this a 10/10? Don't be silly, I've given less than that to some Miyazaki stuff.\\n\r\nWhy not a 9/10? Because it isn't revolutionary, nor surprising, nor shocking enough to deserve an almost-masterpiece score. It's honestly \"Very Good\", nothing less, nothing more.",

It is a story in a fantasy virtual world which is what you would expect from SAO, this time it looks likeKirito has to risk his life again to protect the virtual world and its population.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIt is not something unique, but it is gorgeous. thus the 9/10 and not a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\ncan't wait for the official release of SAO Alicization OST. great OST implemented perfectly, nothing to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhile Kirito did not change much compared to previous seasons, his companion, Eugeo, has gone through a lot of development, the other named characters are all unique and interesting. Some has just had a portion of their generic backstory shared to justify their actions which is better than nothing indeed but does not suffice.\\n\r\ncharacters are not outstanding as some other shows but good enough to not make the show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\na perfect 10, started the show when there were about 12 episodes aired and I caught up the next day, fight scenes are not long but smoothly animated to make you enjoy every second of it, the OST as I already said is great (including in battle scenes), the rest of the time is spent explaining important things, developing the characters and building up for later events/revelations.\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\n9/10, I have only been praising SAO so far (and no I am not an SAO fanboy) but I understand why some people may not, if you enjoyed the previous seasons/movie  then this one will not disappoint, if on the other hand, you hated all of SAO, you are better off skipping this one as well.

            "content": "SAO has always been one of my favorite animes of all time. I hold this anime to a very high standard and because of that, I decided to hold off on watching week to week at first so I could get a proper binge watch in for the first 15 episodes. I watch a lot of anime but SAO, in particular, is an anime that I expect to affect me in a totally different way than other shows. I expect this show to hit me emotionally, please me with visually striking images, and to provide excellent soundtrack music during its airtime. So far, this showhas done everything that I have expected (with some minor hiccups here and there.)\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I basically love this anime and everything about it. I think the show's art is only matched (and beaten) by Violet Evergarden in terms of aesthetic and overall production value. There is a very clear difference from SAO 1 & 2 and Alicization in terms of this. The sound design is flawless, with each clash of the sword sounding more epic than the other. The voice acting is stunning as well. I would like to praise the Eugeo voice actor for demonstrating considerable range and depth as the show has progressed. The fights here are more plentiful and just as stunning as those that happened in previous seasons. It's as if the developers said to themselves \"The name of our show is Sword Art so we're going to make sword art truly amazing.\" Each fight is epic and carries with it the same emotional weight as the Gleam Eyes fight in SAO 1. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of this show screams that the producers looked at what made SAO great and just emphasized this going forward. Kirito's character is also very much refined and matured from the first couple of seasons. He actually gets beaten up a lot and requires help in the majority of his fights. While I never really cared that he won all of his matches, I know a huge criticism against him was that he was too perfect. Actually, Kirito makes A LOT of mistakes in this show and is constantly on the losing end of things as he tries to make sense of this new world. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot emphasize further on how excellent the fights are. They are easily some of the best pieces of work that I have seen in an anime ever. There is so much to love here, truly. \\n\\n\r\n***SPOILERS BELOW****\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is so much that is great about this anime, there are some things that have rubbed me the wrong way or just not worked for me. I should first admit that these are things that generally have not ruined the anime for me and can be fixed by the conclusion of the season. Firstly, as emotional as the show is, it still hasn't struck my emotional cord as much as the previous seasons have. I feel 'slightly' less invested emotionally than I have so far now 19 episodes in. This season is going to be 50 episodes so there is room to change this. I believe they should work Asuna into the plot more to get more emotional involvement. Also, being 50 episodes and having just experienced a filler episode, I can't help but think that there will be more down the pipe. A part of me thinks that they extended their episode count beyond the amount of source material they have. \\n\\n\r\nWhile these are things that have me concerned but can be fixed with future episodes, there are also a few things that just rubbed me the wrong way. I am talking about the rape episode in particular and a few other things. I know Sword Art has a history of rape themes throughout but I wasn't expecting an entire episode to be devoted to a bloody and disgusting rape scene that left me feeling sick where I did not enjoy a single second of it. Alicization to me is supposed to be a refinement and mastery of what people love about SAO. To make an entire episode devoted to rape was just a huge turnoff for me. I also have not enjoyed the filler episode as well as the two episodes that involved the Cardinal where she explained back story. The Asuna plotline is razor thin and has provided nothing but wasted time. There is so much to love about this show and I hope to see less of these negative elements in future episodes to come. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Don't really like that little dwarf minion guy that froze Bercouli I can just tell he will bring nothing interesting to SAO.",

            "content": "Honestly I started this anime with really high expectations because I was told that this season will be the best one so far. So far, that statement is entirely false. This anime is by far the most inconsistent show I have ever saw. Most of the time if a show is bad, it stays bad all the way and good show stays good all the way. However this anime is good sometimes and boring as hell for the most of the time. \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nAt this very moment I cannot judge the story because nothing really significant happened in this show. This is also thedownfall of this anime. Hopefully the story will finally pickup at some point.   \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply very pleasing to look at and I have no complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: \\n\\n\r\nThere are no bad songs that I recall. However the openings are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10: \\n\\n\r\nSome of the side characters seem bland and uninspired. And most of the main cast tend to act cool or edgy most of the time. The characters in this anime seem very simple, cliche and overdone to the point where they do not feel special or human in any way. In other terms, the good guy are the most good of good to have ever gooded the land and the bad guys are the baddest of the bad and they will ALWAYS do bad things because they are bad.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is still very enjoyable mostly because of the flashy colors. However that is ruined by the fact that this anime is the most inconsistent piece of garbage you will ever experience. One episode can be simply amazing and the other would be a bunch of characters sitting their moving their lips of 20 minutes talking about a plot point that I don't care about. Also, can we not put scenes of the outside world in the show, that kinda ruined the mystery of the why Burito is in a video game. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: This show has some flaws but its still good. Hopefully the many problems in this anime will be fixed in the future.",

            "content": "Unrelated to the Gun Gale Online spinoff, this season of SAO continues the main story line right after the Death Gun incident from the second season. There appears to be some new VR Full Dive technology around and it would seem that despite his traumatizing experiences with it, Kirito's interest to check it out is no less than what it was before. SAO: Alicization, as its prequels, establishes a strong setting with unfortunately lacking authenticity in the character department. Connoisseurs of existentialist themes and philosophy revolving around life and death will again enjoy this. However, be warned that the characters are not written to bevery believable and some previous tropes (power tripping, greed) are being rehashed without much novelty. My enjoyment in this I can attribute mostly to the fact that I am a sucker for existentialist themes, which are being established well in the first half of the show. If you disliked the prequels however, you will also dislike this.",

But those are generic to any anime that uses them.\r\nHow the characters behave and talk to each other is ridiculously bad. Like a novice wrote the dialogues.

There are some boring moments and it kinda drags on for a while but the action is intense and the animation is beautiful. the ending is also beautiful and gives a good cliffhanger for the next season. \r\nI thought this anime was well done and worthwatching the 24 episodes. Sword Art Online sometimes has a little too much dialog and not enough action but I think Alicization is a good mix of both, could probably still use a little more action for my taste. I've been giving out a lot of 8s lately because that's just where I am with most new anime I've been watching, there's a lot of good shows airing but nothing that I would say is a masterpiece including this so another 8 here.",

            "content": "A little summary of what I think of SAO in general. Somewhat liked the first 7 or so eps of season 1,but  hated rest of season 1 and the entirety of season 2. I had very little expectation going into Alicization but I decided to give it a chance after reading that it was the best arc. I will definitely agree that it is the best SAO arc by far.\r\nStory: 8/10.  Much, much better than the previous arcs. That said, there still are writing issues, most of which stem from the author's tendency to portray Kirito as the overpowered, perfect harem master. Thankfullythis time, there is a second protagonist, Eugeo to save the day. More on this later. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big improvement over the previous arcs is the stakes. After the first arc, it was really hard to care about anything going on because in the end, this is about some kids playing a stupid video game. This time, however, I cared. The virtual AI's have feelings, hopes, and dreams just like real humans do. Even though the setting is a virtual world, the anime does an excellent job of making it feel real in an organic way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10. It could have been great, but it's meh. The character designs look good, but that's where the pros end. There are frequent animation errors and serious blips in the presentation (especially pronounced during some action sequences). If you liked the Light Novel style illustrations, you won't find it here by the way; the art style is quite different.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. Huge improvement. Eugeo is well written. He actually has flaws and believable motivations. He develops as a character throughout the story. I also liked the way they wrote Alice, the main girl of this arc. She's not just caught and imprisoned in a cage sucking her thumb like Asuna did in arc 2, nor is she useless/boring like all the other heroines. Moreover, the main villain is WORLDS ahead of Kayaba or the other villains whose names I didn't bother to remember. The extra characters felt fresh and intriguing as well, which is a first for the series. The only cons come from it being... SAO. Kirito is still boring and previous girls (Asuna included) are useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. Because of the massively improved writing and characters, in addition to the plethora episodes the animators have to work with, I enjoyed the anime immensely. I hope this continues into future cours.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, if you absolutely hated all of SAO, this probably won't interest you. But if you saw potential in the early episodes of SAO, I would recommend this series. It's what SAO should have been from the beginning.",

Five episodes of any decent anime have more action and character development then this anime has in 19.\r\nEven tho we see Kirito again he is nearly completely disconnected from older plot so much that they are building him agen (as character) even tho you knoweverything about him and his personality. \\n\\n\r\nOnly good thing i found in this anime were fight animations. They are spotless and very well created but they dont get nearly as much screen time as they should for anime that is listed as: \"Action, Game, Adventure\".

My laptop became my room 101. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so to actually explain the previous paragraph, I used to say always that SAO was never as bad as people made it out to be and really had one serious problem above all others: Needs less Kirito and more of... literally any other character. Any of them. But this new series, promised to be the best yet in fact, instead does in spades what every critic has always accused the series of... in spades.\\n\\n\r\nAll the supporting characters, especially Asuna, are fairly compelling but instead we are feed Mr Bland, Mr OP 'Beater' Kirito till we are filled from gullet to arsehole. \\n\\n\r\nBut here we are, in the year of Our Lord 2026, and what do we have? More Kirito. In fact, he is the most Kirito he has ever been. The most powerful and the most bland. And look, another virtual game that he is instantly lord and master of. Yay. \\n\r\nBut wait, now he has Eugenio too, who while fairly bland himself, has at least a little character. In the final tally counts well against him as his sole character trait is, he's a total bitch. A complete and total bitch. In a just universe, he would be made to cut that tree till the heat death of the universe, that is the only lot such a pathetic do-nothing should have in life.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some sort of... plot about... Kirito being assaulted, put into a coma, linked into a highly ascended nerve gear machine by his workplace at the behest of the Japanese government where they create copies of the human psyche using only the finest psuedo-science. But really... I mean, who cares? \\n\\n\r\nIt's Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nThere could be some sort of moral conumdrum about the value of the reasearch such an endeavour would produce versus the life and dignity of a human or at what point are these ersatz-psyches enough to be considered real people? \\n\\n\r\nBut it's Kirito. We don't care about Kirito. We can't care about Kirito. Not any more than we could care for a throw-rug or cardboard box. He is chattle, literally a piece of cheap, digitally rendered chattle. A disposable man for a disposable art. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of SAO has always been Kirito, and now we are being given yet another goddamn double-cour, or maybe more, helping of Kirito. Bland all the way through. He is so generic among shounen protagonists in that he is the MOST generic among shounen protagonists. There is no character here and a shounen anime is nothing but a character story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is perhaps why Gun Gale Online Alternative was so well recieved, despite having the Link Start albatross hung about it's neck. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are really pretty weak too, the alicization stuff is dishwater-strength fantasy anime design and the other stuff is what it always was. I feel there has been a real step down in character design. But that's just puppet strings and they would vanish from view if the sins of boring character and story were corrected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I have nothing positive to say about the show I will say it did allow me to finally give up my constant, near-decade defense of the frachise. It's quite liberating really.\\n\\n\r\nSo, congratulations A1, you did it lads. I, a staunch former SAO apologist have finally decided; I love big brother... and I hate Sword Art Online.\\n",

            "content": "Oh boi, it's a Sword Art Online\r\nSo unlike many others, I've actually generally enjoyed the Sword Art Online series. I really liked the Sword Art Online arc of the first season (like many others) and was a little less impressed with the Alfheim Online arc... but I still enjoyed the the adventure even if I had some grievances. I actually really enjoyed the Gun Gale Online arc and Mother's Rosario of the second season. Mind you I did sorely miss a fantasy setting. \r\nI thought that Alicization would be something I really like with it going back to a fantasy world. Sadly I was leftwith a lot of very hollow feelings. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals of the show are pretty sub standard even for A-1 pictures. There's nothing here to write home about. The visuals are clean and neat but the characters all really kind of look the same honestly and the background are dull. It's like Kirito and Blonde Kirito are off on an adventure through halls and stairways. The background and settings do little to excite the imagination. \\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters: There was some potential in all of this. Actually I'd say the story is pretty decent, it just suffers because of lack of stakes or impact. Kirito is poisoned and so he gets experimental treatment in a full dive system. Asuna is worried and clearly untrusting of the company doing the treatment. The real world aspect at the beginning of the season is arguably some of the more interesting stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThat said once it flips to Kirito's side of the story inside Underworld that's where it really kind of weakens. The world just feels flat, the characters that Kirito meets are new AI's meant to mimic humans who grow up and live lives no different then any other human to be honest. That said it is hard to get into a story with these new characters. Simply put we are told to get invested, and there's an artificial sense of bond we are supposed to feel between Kirito and these AI's but it didn't resonate at all with me. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put I did not care about Eugio or Alice as characters, and that made it really hard to get into the story. I didn't even sincerely believe Kirito's bond with them. It made it hard to feel anything towards them. It's sad because this isn't even a new topic for SAO. Season one had Yui, an AI that Kirito and Asuna adopt, and I honestly got more of a connection from those characters. \\n\\n\r\nSo when the whole story is that Kirito and Eugio want to save Alice... and that's the only motivation for everything, it felt really hollow. I mean Kirito doesn't even seem to be driven to figure out a way to get out of this new VR game. Honestly the stakes on paper look high, but in reality what is really at stake? We aren't told what happens if Kirito dies in the game. Does he die in real life? It's a very convincing VR world, but he's not strapped into headset that can fry his brain. This is kind of the core problem of the story. There's this gap between the initial tension of the start of the season, and the new problems introduced within the virtual world. \\n\\n\r\nThe two problems never even really intersect or acknowledge one another. So the conflict within the game takes precedence. It's here that you have a competent story. There's a very clear cut goal, and quest to be had with obstacles to overcome to reach that goal, and it's all handled nicely. It's just that it doesn't line up with other established things. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the rules of Underworld are incredibly loose and a lot is left unexplained. Also of all the VR worlds, this one feels the least like it's VR. Save for the occasional menu pop up and mention of admins and stuff, you'd think it was a generic fantasy anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the real problem with this newest season of SAO. If it wasn't for the brand name tied to this story, it would be incredibly generic and mediocre fantasy anime. It barely feels like I'm watching an SAO story unfold. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just a generic fantasy anime with Kirito a character I became invested in over the years so now I want to see what happens next. Mind you nothing really happens that feels worth while till the final two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: honestly the music was largely forgettable. I don't remember much from it and nothing stood out. There wasn't anything ear grating, but nothing you will find gets stuck in your head. \\n\r\n___________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThe Bottom Line: \\n\\n\r\nIt feels like an empty hollowed out version of SAO. Honestly people like to hate on SAO for things like an OP main character, and some harem tendencies, but those first two seasons were still entertaining and compelling adventures. People did really get on board with the story for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nThat said Alicization is kind of a dull story feeling like a husk of what people enjoyed about the first season. I feel like even fans of the series might be left disappointed by this one. I never considered the first season a master piece but I at least had a lot of fun and enjoyed the characters and the premise even with their miss steps. \\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't like the first two seasons, I have a hard time believing there is something here you will find enjoyment in. I don't know where the story goes next. I'll check it out because I'm invested, but honestly this season felt overly long and drawn out with little reason to keep watching. \\n\\n",

Whether japanese fan have no taste, or the adaptation is really bad. But in any way this is clearly not good.\r\nI was a great fan of SAO, I started it when the first season came out and it was really enjoyable, there were always ups and downs in the arcs but it was still fun, until this season. \r\nI don't even understant why this season is called \"Sword art online\" there is no frikking reason for that except to keepthe old fans of SAO. This story coul have been the same with other character, no need to use our overpowered Kazuto to be the hero again ....\\n\r\nBut well, let's focus on the main problem here: the Story. There is so many plot hole in it that I want to call it: Sword art Online: Gruyere. Sure Reki Kawahara never was an impressive writer, but please. Every single thing that appened in this anime is here to be here because it need to be here. The universe is also colapsing on itself because it's clearly unbelivable. Like in the first part of the anime, Kirito is beta testing a new high tech thing that use fluct ligth. but the thing is, he can't remember what happenned when he comes back to the real life. Wow, Rath's people, you're such genius, taking a beta tester but as he can't remmeber a thing you can't use him to crititizise your world. LOL Also they want to create IA that can fight right ? Like to be part of a war right ? SO WHY ARE YOU GIVING THEM F*****G SWORDS AND MAGIC ? GIVE THEM GUNS!!! Wow, again Rath's people , your genius! \\n\r\nAnd well another part that really bothered me on the last episode is : why is Kirito transforming back in his old self from Sao ? He doesn't use the nerve gear anymore so .... Is it the representation of will's power ? Or just Fanservice ? \\n\r\nButt well, I have so many things to say about the plot being shit but it's already kinda har for me to write this review while making me understandable so I'll stop here ...",

            "content": "Note: Spoilers for the anime and the LNs.\r\nThere are plenty of reviews judging this anime by its own merits. This is not one of them. I have read the SAO Light Novels ever since 2012, after the anime aired and was promptly barraged by criticism. To be perfectly honest, I have not watched the anime until recently, and when I did I could see why it was so hated. Even so, I loved the LNs and I was happy with Ordinal Scale, cheesy romance movie as it was, and I hoped Alicization would finally dial down the hate for SAO. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nAlicization's story delves intothe question of the human mind, and what it means to be human. Sure the technobabble is bullshit, but it's not like Hollywood science does it any better. That said, the anime's plot is incomprehensible at times, and I mostly blame it on the ehh adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, for all the IMAGINATION POWERUP comments this show has, it's true that this game messes with your mind in a way The Seed games don't. It's why Kirito comments that it is indistinguishable from the real world - the STL system supplies the basic information, and your mind supplies the rest (details, graphics, sensation of pain, gravity etc.) Given the nature of this system, \"believe hard enough and the system thinks it's real\" doesn't seem so bullshit. It explains why after his Dive, Kirito had some difficulty readjusting to the real world, and it is probably why he reached out for his sword when he was attacked in episode 1, to cite an example.\\n\\n\r\nJust for viewers to understand that, Kirito would have to monologue enough to break A-1's bank on VA fees alone. Of course, a lot of it is skipped in the anime. And there are many, many more like it - not only plot elements, but also character development. For what the anime accomplished with its storytelling, which if nothing else did an adequate job of going from one plot point to another, I give it a 6. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nThe worst aspect of the adaptation by far. To explain, let me describe the main characters as I understood them before the anime: \\n\\n\r\n- Kirito: A pitiful person. He understands his parents are not his real parents, and doesn't expect them to care for him beyond the most basic necessities. He knows his parents love him, but feels guilty because he feels a disconnect with them. He secretly looks down on other boys his age because he thinks they are childish, so he has no male friends. Even so, he craves company and the feeling of being needed. Eugeo was his first male friend and first student, and once everything was over, he wanted to take Eugeo out of Underworld, make him log on to ALO and show him off to his other friends. \\n\\n\r\n- Eugeo: He comes from a family of farmers and it was expected that he would become one. His family was disappointed when he became a woodcutter. As farming became harder because of natural disasters, his family depended on his wages, but they did not like that they had to depend on him and did not treat him well. His only friends were Kirito and Alice, because the other boys were jealous that he caught the attention of the cutest girl in town. After Alice was gone and Kirito left, nobody wanted to come near him, and they thought he deserved what he got. He understood that, and was resigned to it for the rest of his life. \\n\\n\r\n- Thirty: She felt like a fake borrowing the body of Alice Zuberg, betrayed the system she believed in, and suffered pain intense enough to burn and explode her right eye for it. Not much else needed to be said. She knew that Eugeo wanted Zuberg back and accepted that she would have to die, but requested to be able to see her sister one last time, after all of this was over. Kirito understood that she was a victim and wanted to save her, even though he knew Eugeo only wanted his Alice.\\n\\n\r\nBecause he was desperate for any love, Eugeo fell for Quinella's trap. Because Kirito wanted to save Knight Alice and Eugeo did not, they would have to fight. Because Cardinal (the sub-process) took over Quinella when she was in distress and tried to commit suicide with her body multiple times, Quinella deleted her own emotions. Because Quinella still could not go against what her parents taught her and break an oath, she would have let the trio go. To the average watcher, none of the characters made any sense. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, bonus points for suffering Kirito. Ever since the original SAO, for all the Jesus-kun the anime made him out to be, this has been Kirito Suffers: The Series, and I'm glad people are catching on to that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe quality took a noticeable downturn in the last few episodes, but the art and action more or less look beautiful. Could afford to dial down on the filters and CGs, though they were not enough to bother me until the last episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSWORDLAND HYPE.  Nothing else to be said about Kajiura music. OPs and EDs were stunning, and the mad men reanimated the OP to show later fights. Voice acting work was beautiful, and if you got to watch Yoshitsugu wailing Nobunaga's name, while the latter runs around flapping his arms trying to get someone to notice him in the after-episode 24 stream, you could see why. The VA work makes the scenes at times. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: 6/10\\n\r\nNice quality, hype music, action sometimes. I have an understanding of why plot moves the way it does, even if it's not explained in the show. I have seen worse anime than SAO, and I was equally happy and frustrated with it. A solid 6. \\n\\n\\n",

This is exactly what I saw this season. \r\nThe visuals and the animation in the OP showed us what the production group have and could achieve.

It had been the best in the series and one of the best this season.\r\nBut the story and character development are jokes. Whoever pacing the story musthave not read the novel before, cutting things out and expecting viewers to understand.

Out of thoose kirito is kirito so once again we see jesus save the world, eugeo could have been interesting but stay in kirito's shadow for the most part and when he does get his moment the story make so little sence that the scen which should be emotional are just funny. Administrator and the other girl also being waisted potential for spoiler reason.\\n\\n\r\n\"Waisted potential\" is also what describe best the worst aspect of that arc: its world building. It look really interesting but the \"power of feeling\" bs quickly apear follow by the fact that everything that happend, happend because the person who build that simulation were utter morron. (Very little spoiler: most of the plot happend because they forgot to log out).\\n\\n\r\nMorron also being the best way to describe the characters especialy in the second half, the amount of plot stupidy, plot armor and plot hole need for Kirito to win is impressive to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso one of the most interesting question bring by the setup: how the npc feel knowing that they are just simulation isn\u2019t answer, to be fair that one could be answer in the s4 but still it was a desapointement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall don't waste your time on that, and if the setup look interesting to you then your probably better off waiting for Infinite dendrogram (i can't assure that the anime will turn out good but the LN are interresting)",

I would prefer wait another year or two if that meant having Tomohiko on command.

(Lots of pain, blood and dismemberments)\r\n\u2b24 OP for the first half is amazing. I am still listening to it from time to time.\r\nWHY I DISLIKED:\r\n\u2b24 Most of what I said above was for the first half.\r\n\u2b24 Lots of bromance and very little room for choreography.\r\n\u2b24 The plot left the server as soon as they set foot onthe stairs. The show becomes Bruce Lee's Game of death for next ~10 episodes. Same setting over and over, made up bosses with very little to no background\\n\r\n\u2b24 Same old SAO. Towards the end all we have left is a nerfed Villain and plain characters with empty motivational speeches. Per usual Kirito is waiting for someone to suffer fatal injuries, so he can send condolences, soak up their power, steal the spotlight, grunt and moan as he wishes until the Villain dies\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY:\\n\r\nIts a good thing SAO is learning from mistakes but the change is too little and the show wasnt beyond my expectations.\\n\r\nAside from improved visuals, nothing is notable.\\n\r\nWell I cannot blame them so easily, the plot to start with was a wreck.\\n\r\nExcept for Cardinal none of supporting characters is worth mentioning or remembering.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I might sound too desperate and bashing. I remind you that I evaluated SAO: Alicization based on SAO and 2019 standards.\\n\r\nJust like Kazuma said to Darkness: \"...all I could see in you were your boobs. You are boobs. Boobs\"; \"...all I could see in this show was pile of graphics. The show is pile of graphics.\"\\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I cant see myself giving an average SAO more than a relieving [[7/10]] !\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

I did enjoy this season, the writer made a really good decision by casting out all the other side characters that are all basically cliche stereotypes. The begaining of the whole serise is really good, that is until you get to meet the main vailian, the second the characters interacte with the vilian every thing just falls straight apart, dump right into a dumpster andsome idoit set fire to it and burnt all the good shit that has happened into a pile of unrecongnizable ash. It is not at all the main vilian's fault even though she can be a little bit better developed, she is still a decent villian over all. It can not be blamed on one single decision, it is consisted of many little unignoreable mistakes. The first thing is that they try to start and an whole character arc in like 1 eps, which is just dumb and stupid, and on top of that every character development just have to be done with internal monologue with friends evangilion style, they literly tells you how they changed does little to enphsize it through action. The second biggest problems are the few final boss fights, I don't really care that the vilian is buck naked half of the time, the biggest priblems are that the fight scenes are so badly planed. A character would get brutally injured a the begaining of the fight, wake up in the middle to give courage, and somehow only starts bleeding after the fight is over and the someone is trying to heal him. Also there would be times where the characters are having a emotional talk to the injured people and  the villian would just stand there for like 5 minutes without doing anything even when she can clearly hear them talking and forming up some kind of plan, characters who are suppose to be dead also come back alive for no reason expext for giving a confidence boost and dies again, every thing is just messed up after the characters meet the main villian, i can not explain it with words",

            "content": "The entire season I was on guard hoping that the rumors I heard about Alicization would truly have it be (quite literally) the redemption arc that the series needed.\u00a0 The moment I let my guard down, the moment I do, that's when I'm reminded \"Oh right, this is SAO\" and it fucks up again.\u00a0 Come on, why is this the thing you're consistent about?\r\nStory:\r\nFollowing the events of Mother's Rosario, Alicization takes a different turn to seasons prior where this time, Kazuto finds himself helping out with a research project involving 'Fluctlights', artificial human souls that were created via digital means.\u00a0 After an extremely unfortunate incident(that really shouldn't have happened), Kazuto is put on life support and is thrown into a new VR world called the 'Underworld', where he alongside a Fluctlight in the system named Eugeo hope to rescue a girl from their past named Alice who was taken away by the powers that be that govern the Underworld.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the story of Alicization's first half spans the entirety of the series's runtime, being given ample runtime to fill in the cracks and let the story mature and progress at its own pace.\u00a0 Because of this, any previous problems with the series rushing are pretty much mute since so much of the Underworld and how this VR reality is run is explained and talked about with great detail.\u00a0 In a sense, Alicization doesn't really feel like SAO because so many of its narrative elements are given time to mature, the massive power fantasy with its protagonist is muted down to be almost equal with his cohorts, asspulls are saved only for the end (I'll get to that one...), and the rules of the world are so grounded and consistent that I found myself consistently accepting what was going on and actually was very intrigued by what would happen next given the fact that the build up of the entire series was so well done and reminded me of when I was super engrossed in the series watching Season 1 for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever nothing good can last forever, and the unfortunate reality that this was still part of the SAO series reared its ugly head and put all of the work and effort to make the story not terrible into the trash because fuck you.\u00a0 Both the ending and final encounter with the antagonist of the series are AWFUL.\u00a0 It feels like Kawahara Reki just didn't know what to fucking do to cap off this first half so they just went \"GIANT SWORDS\" and called it a day and capped everything off with a massive cliffhanger in order to ensure people will continue watching despite the fact that's just a nail in the coffin for me to expect the worst to come given how confusing and messy the ending is.\u00a0 I am genuinely disappointed (and sad) about how this section of Alicization ended because they had something REALLY good.\u00a0 For once the story didn't fuck itself so hard, characters were interesting, and the world was really cool, but NO, you can't go one fucking section of this story without throwing caution to the wind and do not just one stupid thing, but multiple in quick succession because sure, why not I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nKazuto (because I hate calling him Kirito) is probably the most not protagonist protagonist he's been since Mother's Rosario.\u00a0 While he largely still doesn't seem to possess any noticeable character traits for himself beyond being the 'amazing protagonist' that reaches for the goal at hand while caring for his friends (you know, generic shit), it'd be wrong for me to say that he doesn't at least improve as a character.\u00a0 Since the series this time doesn't put him on a massive pedestal where he's the virtual gaming god that literally hacks the system and gathers bitches from all four corners of the VR world, what we get is a more subdued and supportive version of him where he's more trying to back those around him and let their character shine through his help.\u00a0 It's a nice change of pace because it gave a chance for everyone around him to shine while keeping him relevant enough for his presence to matter.\u00a0 To me, this is the right balance for him.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Eugeo, Kazuto's partner this time around and probably the most conflicting character the series has made thus far.\u00a0 A largely timid boy who looks up to Kazuto for strength and guidance, what annoys me about Eugeo is how he doesn't for the most part have agency of his actions, relying so much on Kazuto and Alice for any 'approval' of his actions.\u00a0 That's not to say that he doesn't have some spectacular moments to himself.\u00a0 With all of the stupid things he does in this series, he conversely has a number of really choice character moments that balance out this weird dichotomy that the series is trying to achieve with him.\u00a0 I'm not particularly a fan of how they ended up doing his character, (especially given that clusterfuck of an ending), but in the long run it's at least something worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Alice, the sort of 'endgoal' girl that makes up the motivation for our protagonists' actions.\u00a0 If you ask me, there's nothing bad with Alice's character.\u00a0 Though she has arguably the least amount of screentime of the three protagonists, she by far has the most impactful use of her appearances due to the whole 'knight rebellion' thing she has going on, especially when everything she's doing is in response to how everything in the Underworld works/is run.\u00a0 It's a culmination of everything that the worldbuilding/series has done up this point with the setting, and that to me is probably the best thing this season has done in terms of good character.\\n\\n\r\nReal world people hardly matter beyond exposition, so bye Asuna and your dwindling relevance in this story.\u00a0 To make up for that, the residents of the Underworld take on a medieval/European aesthetic with everything from farmers, to knights, to the oppressive church that governs over everything using both faith and an ironclad law to make sure the populace obeys the rules lest they get whisked away in chains.\u00a0 Aside from the Pontifex who is an interesting mix of sociopathic tendencies and god complex (with really shitty plans and a disappointing end), the cast largely falls on continuously building on the world by adding characters like snobby nobles, sword senpais, the blacksmith, knights without their memory, and whatever else you can throw in to make the overall world and narrative that much more interesting since they all culminate into Alice's character and the protagonists' motivations, which work towards the series' favor.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics:\\n\\n\r\nPretty sure A-1's budget for the year was spent on this show.\u00a0 Alicization is undoubtedly beautiful, taking the quality and art of what the production studio achieved in Ordinal Scale and turning THAT into the anime adaptation.\u00a0 Flashy effects, fluid animation, gorgeous art, beautiful scenery, and little to no consistency errors, I could go on and on about just how good the art for Alicization is.\u00a0 Hell, even the CG doesn't even look that bad.\u00a0 I mean it's noticeable, but the shading and modeling of the damned things look like they fit with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne point of questioning I have for abec and by extension the art team at A-1 is why the Pontifex is like...always naked.\u00a0 Like that's a nice dress, why'd you basically dissolve it and make her fight the protags with nothing but her birthday suit?\u00a0 Like I get she's mentally insane with dwindling RAM space, but my god, is fanservice really the only reason why this is a consistent thing for the last what, 6 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose a favorite, I'd say that LiSa's \"ADAMAS\" is my favorite of the two OPs.\u00a0 ASCA's \"RESISTER\" is good and all, but you can't go wrong with another song made by the woman who made Crossing Field one of the most recognizable songs in the span of modern anime.\u00a0 Both of these song are extremely high energy and give off that fantasy feel, but I just personally think that ADAMAS, with the drop that it has is just superior.\u00a0 That being said, they're both great songs, and I'm glad that the new tracks for SAO keep the same quality as the others before it.\u00a0 In contrast, both Eir Aoi's \"Iris\" and ReoNa's \"forget-me-not\" follow the typical SAO song scheme of being more muted and less energy than their OP counterparts.\u00a0 I prefer forget-me-not to Iris personally, but I find them less memorable by comparison.\u00a0 (Also Yuki Kajiura comes back to compose the OST and oh my god Sacred Swords is a good remix.)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nFor all the crap that I really want to give for SAO fucking itself over again with such a shitty ending to this first half of Alicization, I can't deny that this is DEFINITELY a step up from what we ended up getting from GGO (which yes, is the last time that Kazuto was properly in the spotlight).\u00a0 Everything from the pacing, the characters, and the overall writing made it feel worth it to say that I'm watching SAO again unironically.\\n\\n\r\nEugeo might not be as good as a coinciding protagonist that I initially wanted him to be, but Alice more than enough picked up his slack and became so much better than I expected for being the character that was supposed to first be the 'damsel in distress'.\u00a0 That being said, the ending is still stupid and I seriously have no idea what the fuck they were thinking when they ultimately unveiled everything because all the build up got torn right the fuck down, why is there giant swords, what's the motivation for sacrificing yourself, the Pontifex's plan is stupid, I don't care if you're voiced by the Maaya Sakamoto, this is on par with the stupid shit that happened in Fairy dance.\\n\\n\r\nWhile bracing for disappointment is ultimately what I have to say about Alicization (Part 1 apparently) in the end, I'd be remised if I didn't once again comment on just how good the build up is this time, especially in comparison to the rest of the series since it felt like the season this time had the time to really make the story happen instead of just let the plot run by.\u00a0 I just hope that by the time Alicization 2 comes around, we get an apology for this climax.\u00a0 Cause man, that was bad.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online III is just as awesome as the other two seasons. It's taken quite a turn in terms of telling the story as this season is quite psychological to be honest. Seems like the story is made in a way to play with your mind and I like that. It's a bit different than consistently releasing generic episodes. I love how they always find a way to make each season entertaining and it's always in a cool little unique quick like this.\r\nOne thing that instantly caught my attention was the intro music. I'm all about the intro music I love a good intromusic otherwise it's just a skip for me. I dislike the ones that are over 2 whole minutes long as it gets tedious but in this season it seems like they cut the intro down way too short instead! I love the intro music and it's also easily found on YouTube but it would have been even more awesome if they made this one as long as the other two.\\n\\n\r\nNothing has really changed in the art style or anything but I do love seeing new scenery and damn there is a lot of new content to take in with this season. I don't want to give anything way so I'd just have to tell you to watch it. It's slower paced than usual but I like that they try different things and I think the whole series is just a massive bundle of bad-ass anyway so who cares! :)\\n\\n\r\nI really don't understand why so many others have bashed this series. All complain about it being trash and \"this season is just the same\". I'm sorry but if it's so trash then why do all these other people keep watching every episode and \"waste time writing reviews\". Strange indeed. I think most of the community here are surely just having laughs, is it an inside joke or something? Truly I am not sure...? :s\\n\\n\r\nI'm not even overly obsessed or a massive fan of anime or anything. I just love this one probably as it's one of the only few animes I have watched, so I don't really have anything to compare the pros and cons too I guess. I love it and am enjoying anyway and so I'd recommend to any anime fan <3",

The story was interesting, it had an intriguing air to it, the characters showed promise.  I can recommend watching, but absolutely hard stopping at 4.  After that, you are warned.  The flaws of the previous seasons come creeping back then slap you in the face.  Unnecessary, slow drama ruins the pacing.  Hateable yet untouchable antagonists make the show difficult to watch.  Bythe time I saw a Content Warning on episode 10, I knew I had to give up.  SAO is still SAO, a beautiful concept that, in execution, is the opposite of fun to watch.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online: Alicization is (as you may have already heard) a massive step up from previous seasons though to be fair that really doesn't say much. \r\nIt's simply a basic fantasy-ish sci/fi-ish isekai-y show that we've come to expect from sword art though it has made three major changes to sword art fundamentals that make it so much better.\r\nFirstly the fanservice is gone. Now I can appreciate some good fanservice as much as the next guy but the overabundance of it in previous seasons I think we can all agree detracted from the quality of the show as a whole. Though this is theleast of the three problems it is nice to see that they put some thought into how to retain audience attention instead of just shoving T&A in our face constantly.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly the side-characters. Apart from one episode focused kind of around them and maybe two other scenes the side characters (bar Asuna) are completely ignored and the show is all the better for it. Honestly, the only reason I remember some of the side characters exist is that of the abridged. Though to be fair to those who do like such memorable characters as \"token black guy\" and \"oh yeah his sister hung around after the second arc\" these characters do get there an episode of glory before promptly being ignored for the rest of the season (so far).\\n\\n\r\nThirdly and finally the main character. Time to talk about the elephant in the room, the biggest problem with the first two seasons, Kirito. In seasons one and two Kirito was a boring cardboard cutout who was overpowered when he logically shouldn't be. In Alicization Kirito is still a boring cardboard cutout but he's no longer (as) overpowered and they add another character in Eugeo, though he's by no means a complicated character he is far better than Kirito as a character and an audience insert, make no mistakes Kirito is still our lead and is still a bad character but Eugeo makes him just that little bit more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude Sword Art Online: Alicization realized the faults of what came before it and is attempting to build itself into a better show by changing the core problems of it, while I would prefer if the series went full SAOAGGO I can still respect what it's doing to reinvent itself. Does this mean it's a good show? No, it still has its flaws but I do now have hope that this series could one day become something that lives up to the title of #3 (at time of writing) show by popularity on this website.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: oh god i didnt realise how long this review was",

The story was boring and repetitive.

            "content": "Tl; dr: all the budget went for the pilot episode (or call it season preview or whatever) which is relatively nice. But that's the only really nice thing in this season.\r\n=====\r\nSincerely, Kawahara was one shitty writer long time ago when he published SAO, but somehow it was made into relatively good anime series.\r\nIt hadn't had any pacing, story was nonexistent, it was all about just waifus and there wasn't much plot, yet somehow they was able to produce an enjoyable thing.\r\nThey're basically rewritten the entire thing, adding some logical links that should be there (but was never actually thought by the author), paced it anddirected it into one good show.\\n\\n\r\nWhy, for the love of god, why couldn't they make at least something not horrible when they had one of the latest Kawahara's stories? Kawahara honed his writing skill for decades, finally making something with good setting, with story, plot and pacing all included, with characters instead of placeholders this time and with reason instead of waifu hunt.\\n\r\nAll they needed to do this time is to just not fuck up.\\n\r\nYet they fucked up royally.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I had very little hope after the season II and that shitty spinoff.\\n\r\nYet, when I saw the budget, some hope was resurrected inside me.\\n\r\nSadly, only to be raped and slain mercilessly.\\n\\n\r\n=====\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to go deep into details on this one, I'll just point few moments and I promise that these are the best moments and everything else is just boring and doesn't worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nMoment #1:\\n\r\nSo we have this relatively decently directed PVM scene where one of two main characters got seriously injured and at this point combat scene just stops so they can have their moment of yaoi. This moment is minute long! The fucking whole minute (that is more than enough to rip those kids to shreds during their sudden homosexual stroke) bad guys just stand still and watch them talking to each other.\\n\r\nMartial arts choreography is already shitty at this moment.\\n\\n\r\nMoment #2:\\n\r\n10 minutes long rape scene with two girls tied up. Bad guys spent 10 minutes demonstrably spreading girls legs, yet we haven't saw a single pantsu nor a single nipple. Why was that scene had to take 10 minutes instead of one second? Probably for that we can be sure that this series is far beyond point of no return.\\n\r\nDeath scene later in that episode contained a lot of ad-libbing bullshit. Probably to double confirm passing the point of no return.\\n\\n\r\nMoment #3:\\n\r\nNot really a moment, but rather a long standing tendency: there's a lot of info dumps where there was none in the novel (including some accidental major plot distortions just because someone was too lazy to either actually read the novel or to just ask the author), while also some big and meaningful chunks of story are just skipped. Those info dumps wouldn't be needed if only we had the story.\\n\r\nBut, I guess, it's much easier to draw just a talking heads than to draw an anime.\\n\r\nSadly, when in the novel we have a story about a character and then we have a plot twist so we can feel emotions, in here we are just being told the end result without any reason given for us to care.\\n\\n\r\nMoment #4:\\n\r\nA lot of screen time for naked woman who looks and moves surprisingly similar to Yuuki Asuna while having nothing to do with her.\\n\r\nFirstly, it's one very cheap trick to beg for higher ratings.\\n\r\nSecondly, she looks and moves like Asuna probably because character design was too expensive.\\n\r\nLastly, not a single nipple nor anything was shown despite exposing completely naked female person for more screen time than I can count.\\n\r\nWhat was the point of her being naked?\\n\r\nIf not service, then why couldn't we have this scene shown in just ten minutes instead of SIX FUCKING EPISODES, so we can have at least a few episodes for some story (which is available in abundance in the novel, but I guess we are not worthy to see it animated)?\\n\\n\r\nMoment #5:\\n\r\nAmount of minor plot fuck-ups hides the fact that there actually is very good, detailed, structured and well developed interesting multilayered plot in this story.\\n\r\nIt actually feels like someone deliberately sabotaged it.\\n\r\nI can't believe such amount and such magnitude of fuck-ups is even possible.\\n\\n\r\n=====\\n\\n\r\nWritten by me on ninth of April, 2019.\\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-ND-SA 4.0.",

Now back to another part on why i somewhat enjoyed was surprisingly the intro song, and end? (Have watched anime, but still don't know this). They just felt right to me at least, I don't really know why either. The fight scenes to me felt really 'special', except one of them, whichI'm not going to name.

Everything always seems to work out perfectly in the end, which, especially in this anime, is absolute nonsense.\r\nIt feels like the anime makes less sense with each episode you watch.\r\nBesides that, the dialogue is HORRENDOUS. I have literally never seen such poordialogue that made as little sense in those last few episodes... apart from in Glasslip [don't watch it].\\n\\n\r\nThe longer the anime goes on, the sloppier the animation gets as well. Apart from the last episode, which was better. The sound effects [which I usually don't really take into account] seem to pretty samey.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I literally skipped through the last episode because I just couldn't stand to watch this any longer. It didn't make me feel anything, I felt completely detached from the entire anime at the end.\\n\\n\r\nMakes me feel really bad for all the hard work the animators, voice actors etc went through when the plot was just... pretty bad.

I am a SAO fan since the beginning, and the Chinese community(which is my community)have a generally positive attitude towards SAO, so I never found any problems with it. I've seen the mangas, I've read the novels, and I have to admit; the Alicization novel is a masterpiece. We all know that the author of SAO wrote the first few novels to win a competition, and due to the length requirement, there was not much detail description or character developments. He wrote the Alicization novel years later with obviously better writingand anyone who've seen it will call it a masterpiece even they did not like the series. All the problems with the anime is never a problem in the novel. The pacing feels great, and the story is comparable to the good stories such as Erase(which I just watched a few days ago). The character development and etc are amazing, you just can't find much fault with it. But the anime was a mess, I did not enjoy it as much as the novel AT ALL. It has the same problems as The Rising of the Shield Hero, which I've also read the novel, the first few episodes are amazing. Especially the hour-long first episode for both. But as the story advances obvious mistakes were made. Such as characters out of shape or bad(and often) scene divisions. The Scene divisions is a total mess and the fighting quality drops, etc. The thrill the novel can give me never occurs a single bit in the anime. For people who think the anime is bad, you are correct but do not forget that the story itself has no fault with it. A-1 once again ruined a masterpiece. Congrads.",

(oh no)\r\n2) He thinks about his friends and uses his IMAGINATION. (cause that makes sense and hasn't been done at all before)\r\n3) He gets new found powers/strength for no reason.

Why do i have to watch them talk for 3/4 of the episode and end on a cliff hanger?\\n\\n\r\nfor example, there's this one episode where Kirito had to get out of a cell. it literally shows them talking for like half the episode for them to realise OH WAIT WE CAN BREAK CHAINS.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\n- Kirito is very caring (that's all the anime tells you in sao and ggo and this anime)\\n\\n\r\n- Eugene is boring\\n\\n\r\n- Alice is also boring\\n\\n\r\n- Support characters are just there because why not?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nTrash, trash, trash.

            "content": "Sword Art Online: Alicization is what happens when a show opens with all the signs of something good, then falls flat on its own face. Rather than getting up, dusting itself off, and trying again, SAO: A goes the route of Gen I Magikarp and chooses to flop around uselessly for the rest of its run, both embarrassing its viewers and the person too proud to admit despite its overall value in its evolution, it's a pretty shitty Pokemon. Well, Fisher Bob, your Magikarp sucks, and you do, too. \r\n**SPOILERS**\r\nSeriously, spoilers. If you're not gonna watch it and were curious, feel free to keep reading.If you're like me and need to remind yourself why the industry needs support, don't. Or, do, and regret having an interest. \\n\\n\r\nYou good? Okay. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series opens up with Kirito hanging with a couple new friends, a blonde clone of himself named Eugeo; and, a blonde-haired girl named Alice (who may or may not be a copy of Asuna. Jury is still out). After an adventure to a cave to look for ice (one of many poorly-researched topics, and the least-egregious in the series), the trio get lost and witness a dragon-riding knight fighting another dragon-riding knight. The evil(?) knight is knocked from his stead, causing Alice to stumble forward a few steps towards the threshold of the cave and outside into the no-go zone. She trips and falls, her fingertips barely over the threshold. \\n\\n\r\nIn this world, walking into the darklands(?) is forbidden. This child barely had her fingertips over the threshold, and that was by accident. All good, right? Just tell God you didn't mean to and it'll be fine, right? \\n\\n\r\nNope! God decides \"welp, that little girl is a heretic! Better send my inquisition to chain her up and make an example of her!\" So, this guy called an \"Integrity Knight\" drops by the village next day, calls Alice to be arrested, and shenanigans ensue. A few moments later, LOLI'S WITH GUNS GUIZ LOL. The shows goes from interesting premise to everyone messing with a supposed PK'ing clan in GGO because Shino asked them for help. After that insanity, Kirito explains how he has no recollection of events in the Underworld (where we started from). Interesting premise. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then Fluctlights. \\n\\n\r\nLet me explain this in a way that Reki Kawahara fails miserably at doing. In SAO:A, the Japanese government believes \"fluctlights\" are basically the soul, and it's located in the brain. Their intent is to create artificial fluctlights so that war doesn't need to be waged with living people anymore. No, let's create artificial people who are unaware of the nature of their existence, so that we can wage war in video games. Hey, guys, PLANETSIDE 2 EXISTS AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO DETER TERRORISTS AND OTHER WARMONGERING GROUPS FROM STICKING TO RL WAR. Oh, but they thought ahead. Mass-produced artificial bodies for the fluctlights. That's right, son! You can build your own waifu, or put your existing waifu into an artificial body, forever robbing her of the illusion of self-determination and causing her to experience an endless existential crisis after removing her from the setting and events that ultimately shaped her being!\\n\\n\r\nSo, anyways, Kirito and Asuna are walking, Kirito gets REKT by some nerd with a needle because he forgot he's not an irl samurai, and ends up hospitalized. EXCEPT, in the infinite wisdom of the Japanese government in the SAO-verse, they kidnap him and continue the fluctlight experiment. He appears to Eugeo, both their memories gone. He helps Eugeo cut down the giant uncuttable tree so Eugeo can change his calling, the two go to the capital to become Integrity Knights, Eugeo auditions for Thor or Big Boss, Kirito kills a man (seriously, blood and all), both are arrested, and then decide \"lol screw the system\". They fight some Integrity Knights who are actually the Underworld's famous historical figures with their memories altered towards Piety for the world's \"God\" Administrator, decide that Administrator is garbage and it's time to hack the website and dethrone the admin, get into some shenanigans, a loli hugs Kirito, Kirito and Eugeo get paralyzed and dragged around by loli's, Kirito cuts said loli's, they meet notAlice, and then Eugeo becomes an Integrity Knight but doesn't, a loli dies, Kirito saves the day, except he doesn't because brain damage. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the issues. \\n\\n\r\nFluctlights. Fine concept, poor execution. What should have been a series about a man trapped in a game that is actually \"medieval lifestyle simulator 2022\" with existential ponderings about the nature of the soul and how one could go about replicating it (and really, if it ought to even be attempted), is instead just another miserable attempt to inject \"depth\" in an otherwise bland, uninspired isekai. This could have been the entire premise for a first cour that demanded the viewer to ask some rather meaningful questions about a concept that is probably bs, but demands the same amount of consideration as GiTS does with its esoteric content. If fluctlights can be manipulated and transferred to another body, how does that change the nature of our world? Who is artificial, and who is real? It's a great concept which, unfortunately, gets mentioned as an excuse to have a macguffin, and never brought up again. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is easily one of the most interesting in concept. Putting aside the generic medieval concept for a second, you have a world where magic isn't just in existence, but is several lines of code that the people are unconsciously aware of. They perform the \"Arts\" by accessing menus that require an input before appearing, etc. It's an interesting concept, and one that, again, is unfortunately put aside in favor of bland fights and poor exposition. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the characters. Kirito is less OP, but still manages to cock-block his new harem. Eugeo is basically Kirito except more subsmissive and less powerful, which could be neat if he had any character to begin with. Alice is... eh. Her character is a plot device in the beginning, and, when the Integrity Knight version of her appears, it's an under-developed mess that goes from \"DEUS VULT\" to \"lol screw the church\". This also applies to the Integrity Knights who, to our knowledge, are supposedly the supermen and women of the world, but end up as one-off jobbers to Kirito and Eugeo. Hell, in perhaps the worst display of misogyny in the SAO-verse, one of the IK's is only a knight because she has a crush on a dude. I kid you not, her entire purpose for fighting is to get laid. Fuck. Reki. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the end-boss is nothing worth mentioning. Administrator is an over-the-top laughable villain whose pseudo-intellectual banter with Kirito amounts to the following:\\n\\n\r\nA: What is man, but a miserable pile of secrets? \\n\\n\r\nK: A living, breathing organism with the right to choose! If you are God, then I will hath none of ye!\\n\\n\r\nA: But, does God not exist to ye, as well? Then, what is your self-determination, if not the guidance of that uncaring, unloving entity?\\n\\n\r\nK: Aghast! I am confounded by your ability to undermine my self-determination at a basic, grade-school level, as though I've never experienced these existential concerns myself! I am at a loss for words for your wit!\\n\\n\r\nA: Ah-ha! I have taken it upon myself to recognize the hypocrisy of your actions, in opposing my will as \"God\" when my understanding is determined by the limitations of my own creators! Truly, I am superior, since I have bested ye!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, what is life? SAO:A doesn't know, and makes no attempt at even presenting a position. It wants to present neat concepts before devolving into its purposeless fight scenes and mindless drivel all to drive the plot forward. Unfortunately, it crashes right from the start and never recovers.",
