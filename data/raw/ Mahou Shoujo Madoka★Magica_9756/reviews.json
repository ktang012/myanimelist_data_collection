            "content": "What does it take for a series to become a masterpiece? Take a look at Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and you might find the answer to that question.\r\nI'll start this review by pointing out that I was not expecting much from this show. I didn't really want to watch it, either. The Mahou Shoujo genre has never interested me, so when a friend of mine, who in the past suggested things like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, Death Note and Psycho-Pass to me, told me to watch Madoka Magica, I thought he was kidding and I ignored the series for a while. Once a month hadpassed, my friend insisted, and I ended up watching the first episode with my sister.\\n\\n\r\nThrowing all my prejucide aside, I sat quietly and watched the first episode. I found it oddly entertaining, so I proceeded to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd. After the 3rd episode ended, I was completely hooked. And by the end of the 12th episode (or the last episode, if you prefer), I was blown away. Gen Urobuchi had done it again.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] \\n\r\n\t\u2013  \u201cMake a contract with me, and become a magical girl!\u201d\\n\r\nThe main character, Kaname Madoka, is a normal 8th grader. Albeit very shy, she is happy, and her family and friends love her exactly the way she is. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when, on a trip to the mall, she rescues Kyuubei, a cat-like being that was being chased by a mysterious black-haired girl. Kyuubei, as a reward, offers Madoka and Sayaka (one of Madoka's friends) a unique deal: he'd make any of their wishes come true, and in exchange,  they would become Magical Girls. And that is how Madoka, and the viewers, are introduced to a world of magic and witches.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else can be said about the story without spoiling anything. However, I have to point that this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, and it's target audience is NOT little girls. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a very dark anime, please keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot begins to unveil is simply magnificent. The build-up of tension, the plot twists, the drama, the (really heavy) psychological atmosphere-- all contribute to create a story that will keep you on your toes at all times.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\n\t \u2013 \u201cIf someone says it\u2019s wrong to hope, I will tell them that they\u2019re wrong every time. I could tell them that countless times!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has a pretty small cast of characters. Because of this, each relevant character grows and changes throughout the series in ways you wouldn't expect. We get to know a lot about the past of some characters, the reasons behind their actions, their feelings, amongst other things, and that makes each character feel unique-- they don't follow any usual patterns.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound]\\n\r\n \t \u2013 \"Is she some kind of anime character or something?\"\\n\\n\r\nAs usual with Shaft (Bakemonogatari, Maria Holic, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Madoka Magica has a very original/weird style of animation. The design of the characters is rather simple and features very light colors. However, the animations are good and fluid, specially during action scenes (more on that in a bit). Buildings, on the other hand, are very futuristic and look pretty cool. The use of glass and fluid decorations makes me think of a very peaceful futuristic world. Nature, on the other hand, doesn't stick out of the norm, but the mixture of green + the futuristic monochromatic buildings is a very neat contrast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this wouldn't be one of Shaft's best works if they didn't add their \u201ctouch\u201d.  When Kaname Madoka and her friends enter the realm of the witches, one of the coolest styles of animation I have seen in anime to this day steals the spotlight. It's very hard to explain, since it varies from witch to witch, but it's definitly intriguing. And of course, Shaft's signature: weird cam angles during dramatic scenes. Both of these add to the overall chaotic feel of the series, so I have to applaud their use.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica's opening is \u201cConnect\u201d, by ClariS. Although it's nothing out of this world, I feel that it fits the \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d theme perfectly. The show has 4 different ending songs, but \u201cMagia\u201d, by Kalafina, is regarded as the \u201creal\u201d ending, since it plays in the most episodes, and denotes the dark nature of the anime. As for the background music, everything fits right into the scenes; whether it's to add intensity to fights or dramatic moments, the music helps and doesn't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\n\t \u2013 \u201cWith kindness comes na\u00efvet\u00e9. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has got to be the best anime I have ever watched. The way the producers trick the viewers into thinking that this anime is just another Mahou Shoujo is simply brilliant. The characters are interesting, the art managed to catch my attention, and the music is good, but this series' biggest selling point is definitly the plot. Plot twists, drama, heartbreaking AND heartwarming moments... all of these converge into a brilliant plot with a really good ending.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Do not judge a book by its cover!\\n\\n\r\n[Final score: 10/10]",

            "content": "It's been a long while since I watched and completed a magical girl series. So when I first read about SHAFT's first original anime production entitled \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" I was a bit skeptical at first, seeing how I usually don't watched the genre but at the same time curious on how SHAFT and Shinbou Akiyuki will gonna make one with their very unique visual style that defines SHAFT animated works. After watching their previous magical and supernatural series like Bakemonogatari, Dance in The Vampire Bund, Negima, and Natsu no Arashi, I'm convinced that I should at least try the series. \r\nIt\u2019s a magicalgirl series by definition that for quite some time I\u2019ve been avoiding because frilly clothes and magic wands is not something a young adult should be watching or so I believe. But after completing it, I felt fortunate and privileged that I tried it, rarely is a series that can be considered a game-changer, at least in my viewing experience as it convinced me that the magical girl genre can still be enjoyed by young adults like me. The end result is that I\u2019m willing to watch more of this kind of animated works from the past and future.  \\n\\n\r\nIt all begun with a strange dream followed by the introduction of the main character and the world she lives in. Then it was the usual setup in most anime, a new transfer student in the class that will call the attention of the main heroine, followed by a setup that will lead her to a world that she never dreamt existing \u2013 the world of magical girls and witches. The subsequent episodes will document the heroine\u2019s journey meeting people, experiencing different events, journeying bizarre worlds, discovering the truth of the magical girl system and its purpose \u2013 all that will cultivate the one wish she will want granted.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is introduced into the audience in a well planned and carefully executed series of events that will reveal important elements of the plot to move the story forward. Every time it is done, it leads the viewers in the edge of their sit as they ponder what exactly is going on. New characters are eventually introduced along the way, each has an important role; their back story examined and will have their very own moments in the series. The pacing is excellent, never a dull moment in here as each episode is packed with excitement and the right amount of details to keep the viewers looking forward the next episode. It doesn\u2019t help that some episodes ended in a cliffhanger, which lead the viewers particularly me dying from wanting to watch the next episode immediately and hope that it is already the next week. The series ended with a satisfying conclusion; it feels complete but still leaves the viewers wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing SHAFT\u2019s notorious past regarding their animation works, in Madoka Magica there is a welcome change, no longer is the \u201cNO-ANIMATION\u201d as very evident in Bakemonogatari episode 10  will be seen in here, or the character only animation and simple colored background as seen in Hidamari Sketch. For this particular series, SHAFT has produced a world that is engaging with a futuristic approach in their architectural designs from the very spacious, technologically sophisticated, modern design of the main character\u2019s house and the school where she study completely devoid of tight physical space. The background animation is superb, very detailed and probably rivals their other previous best background works in Bakemonogatari (provided there is an actual animation, not the random flashing wallpaper text thing). The color tones are dark and sometimes movie quality indicating how SHAFT probably gave everything they got to animate this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe modern architectural structures some of which are based on real life building designs used to create the cityscape of Mitakihara are very imaginative. The witch\u2019s realm showcases a different kind of creativity in background designs, each realms are carefully designed to evoke emotions from the viewers. \u201cBizarre and surreal\u201d are the proper terms in describing those otherworldly places which offers a hint of the witch\u2019s past before being consumed by despair. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I like Aoki Ume\u2019s \u201cwide face\u201d designs which gave the characters these \u201cnice and cute\u201d facial features, at the same time able to evoke such powerful expressions e.g. when the characters are sad, happy, annoyed, or worried, the wide face design allows the viewers to clearly see those expressions making it possible for them to relate and feel attached to the characters. The character designs used for the witches is a different matter, some look cute and very stylish (e.g. Witch Charlotte), some looked terrible and will give this unsettling feeling of being too real compare to its surroundings (e.g. Witch Gertrud), while some simply look too ugly and has a design that probably only a mother can love (e.g. Witch Oktavia von Seckendorff). \\n\\n\r\nThe transformation sequence are something to look forward also, Tomoe Mami\u2019s transformation sequences are probably the most impressive transformation sequences I have seen to date, thanks mostly to the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies it. The transformation sequence from the other magical girls is all unique looking but not as equally impressive as the one above. The fight animation is also something worth mentioning about since the animators doesn\u2019t cut corners on this one; the fighting scenes are very good and pleasing to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, while I say a lot of very good things about the animation, it comes with minor flaws, one is about the character faces specifically the animation of the eyes appearing a bit off or distorted in distant camera shots and the animation in general is not very smooth for motion. There are also some production errors that are worth noting. Overall, despite the noticeable changes in the animation of Madoka Magica, the series still retains many characteristics that define the unique visual style done by SHAFT like the head tilts, close facial shots, and creative camera angles among others.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one of the highlights of Madoka Magica. The OP theme \u201cConnect\u201d by ClariS is very catchy and pleasant to the ears, makes you want to become a magical girl and currently one of my favorite OPs. The ED theme \u201cMagia\u201d by Kalafina, meanwhile has this very eerie feel on it which is very good in expressing the dark undertones of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks created by the much famed \u201cKaijura Yuki\u201d (which is also the behind the awesome soundtracks of Kara no Kyoukai, Gundam SEED/SEED Destiny, and Tsubasa Chronicle) confirmed that feelings I have, that when you listened to it, the music simply gets into you and all you can think about are magical girls, frilly costumes, and awesome transformation sequences. All the soundtracks are so memorable that I can immediately associate those to the events in the series where it is used as the background theme. My personal favorites in vol.1 and vol.2 are the \u201cSis Puella Magica!\u201d (You Should Be a Magical Girl!) from the scene where Madoka finally said her wish, \u201cDecretum\u201d (Decision) Sayaka\u2019s main theme, and \u201cCredens Justitiam\u201d (Believing in Justice) which is played during Mami\u2019s transformation sequences. Equally impressive though are the soundtracks in vol.3 that are present in the final two episode of the series, the \u201cSurgam Identidem\u201d (I Shall Always Rise) during the battle of the hour, and the \u201cSagitta Luminis\u201d (Arrow of Light) which can also be called the Goddess soundtrack, it is a very heartwarming theme created specifically for the events in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nFeaturing the voices of Yuuki Aoi as the heroine Kaname Madoka, with Saitou Chiwa, Mizuhashi Kaori, Kitamura Eri, and Katou Emiri as support characters, the voices behind the characters in Madoka Magica is an all-star cast that made the overall viewing experience much fun just listening to everyone speaking. \\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica has a small amount of characters, mostly girls that are very cute in my opinion. Kaname Madoka, the heroine of the series is very convincing as a female lead, her struggles that results from the events leading up to her finally saying her wish as well as the measures that she used to counter it are very well portrayed. The other main character that is really well portrayed is Akemi Homura, just like Madoka, her descent to what she have become up to the very end is very well told, her actions justified. Tomoe Mami\u2019s appearance is short but has a very lasting appeal, I always remember her as the \u201cWhat a Magical Girl should be\u201d, her performance, confidence, and graceful movements especially in her fights are very elegant to watch. Then, there is Miki Sayaka, whose story is just sad to watch. The other main character that is introduce late in the series is Sakura Kyouko, initially I hate her character only seeing her as a jerk and a warmonger, but as the episode progress and her past eventually revealed, I believe her actions are justified and I eventually liked her character. Lastly amongst the main characters, I\u2019ll talk about Kyuubey, as a familiar, he is like no other, his performance as the acting villain is really a very wild ride, his words are very evil at the same time not really evil, and his trickery into convincing the girls to make a contract with him makes you want to curse him and shot him with weapons till his body broke into smithereens deserves a high praise and probably an award for doing so. In the end, when all is said and done, especially when he explain the purpose of his existence, I eventually seen him in a good light.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters which represents the rest of the cast like Madoka\u2019s parents, brother, teacher, as well as Sayaka\u2019s love interest and rival also added very important contributions that leads to the development of the main characters. Worth noting is Madoka\u2019s mother Kaname Junko, her conversations and closeness to Madoka as mother-and-daughter is very touching and very refreshing to watch. Also is Shizuki Hitomi, as she did an important role in the middle part of the story. The Witches, while having no real character, with the only hints given about them concerning their past is the design of their realm also added a different form of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the most outstanding series I have seen in recent times. Rarely is a series that has its contents in the form of story, visuals, music, and characterization that are all equally impressive that results in me enjoying the series so much. Even more impressive is the fact that Madoka Magica is a \u201cmagical girl genre,\u201d something I already avoided years ago thinking that there is nothing about the genre that will interest me anymore. After all, the notion about the genre is that it\u2019s \u201ctoo girly\u201d and a \u201ckid\u2019s show\u201d, this series proves that it is not, that it can touch audiences outside its main target audience. It also assures that the genre is something I will be looking forward with enthusiasm and eagerness. Appropriate also to say is that Madoka Magica is the kind of series that appears once every few years that really hit the right marks, the things that makes an anime very great. \\n\\n\r\nAs for my final note, I would recommend this series for viewers who like anime in general. Most recommended to individuals who like a magical girl theme anime that is geared towards the more mature young audiences as the series contains drama and dark themes that is not really very unusual to the genre, it\u2019s just that the series used it correctly, and intricacies that could either make the viewers like or dislike the series.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Updated, added additional impressions after completing BD release",

            "content": "I am the juice of my acid.\r\nSHAFT is my body, and drugs are my blood.\r\nI have created over a thousand seizures.\r\nUnknown to DVD sales.\r\nNor known to stream on time.\r\nHave withstood food to create many anime.\r\nYet, those hands will never hold money.\r\nSo as I pray, \u201cUNLIMITED SHAFT WORKS\u201d\r\n-a rewrite inspired by those thousand freaking awesome muskets shooting at moustachioed dandelions during the end sequence of the first episode.\r\nYou have just stumbled upon the ultimate Mahou Shoujo, one that doesn't care if it's morally ambiguous or not, one with no stock footage, and one where the magic used substitutes candy for bloodbaths.\r\nStory: Magical Girl overtones combined withthe trance-like aesthetics of SHAFT and the glorious character designs by a small green man who lives on top of an all-girls Japanese high schools dormitory (see Hidamari Sketch). The script is written by Urobuchi Gen, known for his work on Fate/Zero (hence the poem) and the highly-acclaimed (and crazy good) visual novel Saya no Uta. He's also noted for making me rub out to a pile of sludge. I really like Mr. Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a dark Mahou Shoujo. Not like Nanoha at all. Nanoha had some seinen elements in it, but Madoka is a seinen. It takes all the elements of Mahou Shoujo, chucks them in the trash, and completely rewrites the genre. I should note that I have watched a fair amount of anime tagged Horror here on MAL, and not a single one has actually instilled fear in me like Madoka has. This is the only Mahou Shoujo I have come across that actually covers events like suicide, murder, and death in a serious manner and keeps them believable. There is a heavy amount of psychological elements in this anime, too, I should warn. In congruence, I want to laud how the characters mental states and characterization pushes the plot forward unlike many productions. The psychological aspect is so crucial to the story, that without it, the story would be nonexistent. \\n\\n\r\nA slight digression on becoming a magical girl: (minimal spoilers)\\n\r\nEven after a couple of episodes Madoka does not become a Mahou Shoujo. I've heard a lot of complaints that \"she isn't even a magical girl yet, this is stupid\" etc. If you're part of this group, please enlighten yourself with this knowledge; Madoka takes a spin on many magical girl aspects. Thus, gaining magical powers, which usually occurs in the first or second episodes of most magical girl series is an event that is pushed farther off in Madoka. Don't get me wrong, the anime doesn't just do this to be nonconformist. Madoka utilizes the obtainment of power as a driving part of the story and character development. What Madoka factors into it's execution that other magical girl anime don't is the risk of death, and how gaining powers makes you even more susceptible to it. That is why I believe the anime didn't just give the girls powers very early in the series, and I hope this short blurb clears up this little misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: SHAFT WAS HERE (insert every other company name here) IS A LOSER\\n\\n\r\nThe dreamscapes in this anime are stupendous and the frightening nightmarish worlds that appear are undeniably scary. The expansive frontier that the cast is thrown into really delivers the sense of isolation that I believe the staff wanted to present. As for the normal world, SHAFT works it's magic on the buildings and rooms - applying an almost futuristic setting while still within the boundaries of reason. The skyline shots and the pans over wide areas are notably beautiful and quite reminiscent of Ef - a tale of memories (another SHAFT work). There has been some complaint about the character designs, but I would say that they're used in this anime the same way Higurashi used theirs. With the lure of a peaceful and happy scenario, fleshed out with a goofy looking set of characters, the anime seems so innocent. That is until you watch a little of it. Don't create a predisposition on this anime by it's naive appearance, this is one scary anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to praise the transformation scenes. They are never extensively erotic, as that aspect tends to be abused in anime such as Moetan or Nurse Witch Komugi, and they are always different. The second time a transformation scene happened I double took the scene and watched it again to make sure that my eyes weren't deceiving me (so I guess I ended up watching the animation twice anyways, but regardless). That's right, a magical girl transformation sequence that is different every time and isn't overused to consume air time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is like this fabulously intense orchestration that just makes you feel LARGE. The opening animation accompanying the sound definitely contributes to the song and I find it very fitting. One thing to note about the OP is that there's a larger portion of crying than there is of laughter, which should be hint enough to prepare you for an experience that doesn't want to make friends. The ending preformed by Kalafina (Kara no Kyoukai, Sora no Woto) is eargasmic. It has a brutal and rough distorted sound, and isn't full shown until the ending of the third episode. It's stark contrast with the opening really works. The animation set to the ending is a bit spooky if anything, and the hard angry vocals of Kalafina make it all the more intense. The sound track throws in some \"acid music\" (there's not a word for what SHAFT has done here) so just watch out for that music. Word on the street is that side effects include chronic arousal and aviator application. I can personally vouch though, that the soundtrack is varied and creative, and that it's hard to remove your sick shades for more than a few seconds while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Madoka Kaname is the average personality-less protagonist who is best described (by herself) as \"kinda dumb\" and \"has no special skills.\" She leads an average life with a loving family. Her friends are a tomboy and aradere that at first prospect have no impressive qualities. Then Madoka learns about Mahou Shoujo who fight in secret to defend society. They fight entities called \"Witches\" that spread distress and anxiety. If you're expecting a happy-bubbly slice-of-life, you couldn't be anywhere further away from the mark. Mahou Shoujo Magica Madoka is a very dark anime. It quickly shifts from drinking tea to suicide's with unsettling skill. The characters are a whole lot more complex than the average Mahou Shoujo - where the characters often don't develop at all, within the first few episodes so much development occurs that you might be wondering if you're watching the same anime (and the development is presented incredibly believable). With Urobuchi Gen on staff mind shattering moments are abundant. Gen has even come out straight and said this is an anime that can be understood even better re-watched. The characters are a lot more in depth than you would expect from a Mahou Shoujo, and are surprisingly realistic. If you want moe~moe~ magical girls, then please refrain from watching Mahou Shoujo Magika Madoka, because Madoka deals a lot more with relationships and human issues than it does try to be cute and funny. Yoshinoya-Sensei also plays a cameo (but she's wearing a wig so watch carefully).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is your brain on drugs. Cue Freezepop's song Brainpower.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Madoka has an uncanny knack for going from quaint to disturbing incredibly fast. It also has the ability to BLOW YOUR MIND. So go watch it, okay?\\n\\n\r\nAfter the final episodes have aired, I can say with confidence, if you're willing to brave through the first three episodes that totter between \"cliche Magic Girl anime\" and \"mysteriously dark\" then you'll be pleasantly surprised that the latter is what you'll receive throughout. Madoka ranks with very few anime. It is one that start with a whimper and ends with a whimper, but is packed with bangs throughout.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe following are notes I added after each episode aired between January 7th, 2011 and April 22nd, 2011:\\n\r\nPS: I WISH MY MOM GAVE HI FIVES LIKE MADOKAS DOES\\n\r\nWHAT AN EXECUTIVE\\n\r\nPS2: GIGA MUSKETTT BUREEAKKKKERRRRRRRR... and imma sip some tea now.\\n\r\nPS3: Needs a hardware update.\\n\r\nPS4: I cry out of fear watching this.\\n\r\nPS5: fat chicks yum\\n\r\nPS6: DON'T PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS LIKE THAT HOMG\\n\r\nPS7: I can see Kyouko being all like \"GIMME ALL YO FOOD, OR I WILL EAT YOU\"\\n\r\nPS8: Fried Kyubey on a Stick - A southern American delicacy\\n\r\nPS9: I think I'm watching a Darren Aronofsky production\\n\r\nPS10: I liked this episode because they explained Homura's hair.\\n\r\nPS11: Battler would approve of this end",

            "content": "It's long been the case that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on certain genders and age groups, and this fact is most apparent when one considers the mahou shoujo category. From Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew to Pretty Cure and Shugo Chara, the titles on offer that feature the exploits of one or more magical girls all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, cute outfits, cute sidekicks, \"cute\" costume changes, twinkly/sparkly/sugary atmospheres, and a penchant for appealing to the sensibilities of 7 to 14 year old girls.\r\nThen there are the anomalous titles that deviate from the triedand tested approach as they attempt to broaden the horizons of the genre, the most successful example being Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha. The franchise gave audiences a chance to see Takamichi Nanoha grow from a very young and naive magical girl into the Ace of Aces for the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and combat instructor to the next generation of heroes. The surprising thing though, is that somewhere along the way the series managed to successfully bridge the shoujo-shounen divide, which is a difficult thing to do in a genre that's generally aimed at girls who still think bright (sometimes almost fluorescent), pink is a good colour to wear.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are only a few good titles on offer that have broken with the traditional mahou shoujo mould, which isn't surprising if one considers the difficulty of the task in question - take something for young girls and make it appeal to as broad a fan base as possible. Then again, Shaft seem to relish that sort of challenge, and while their take on magical girl anime retains a certain \"fluffiness\" that is prevalent in the more stereotypical shows, Puella Magi Madoka\u2605Magica is an altogether different beast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a young girl looking for and exit with which she can escape a strange black and white checkered area, but instead of finding the outside world she finds that surreal destruction has come to Mitakihara City as a dark haired girl fights a very odd creature in the sky. A small white animal named Kyuubey advises her that she has the power to help the dark haired girl, to change this fate of grief and destruction, to be granted her heart's desire. All she has to do is make a contract and become a Puella Magi ...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then she wakes up.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the rather dramatic first few minutes the storyline takes on a fairly staid measure as the main plot is laid out and the characters are introduced, but while the narrative is relatively well constructed, it's not without its flaws. The series has a tendency towards melodrama that can sometimes slow the pace of events, and this brings into focus certain aspects of the plot which are very clearly designed to evoke a sympathetic reaction from the audience. In addition to this, while the rather obvious influence from Buddhism (the whole deal with maintaining balance, karma, etc), is prevalent for much of the show, the decision to broadcast the final episode on a specific date only serves to highlight the reference to Christian beliefs that forms the grand finale. That said, it's easy to overlook these as the main thrust of the storyline is entertaining , and much darker than one might initially expect, especially when one considers the character design and everyday scenery.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is interesting is the manner in which the writing team have tied in the importance of the third wish to the whole concept of resurrection (ask me if you want an explanation), which may sounds a bit strange at first but it actually works rather well, especially as the traditional \"deal with the devil\" scenario generally doesn't have any kind of achievable escape clause.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are two problems with the storyline, both of which aren't immediately obvious. The first is the assumption that only girls of a certain age are ideal for becoming Puella Magi, with all that entails. The justification for this is debatable, and brings up the whole idea that \"boys don't cry\". The storyline is built upon the concept that adolescent girls are more emotionally unstable than boys of that age, yet this is an untrue statement for two reasons, the first one being that boys are also undergoing physical and emotional changes. The second reason is that boys are taught from a very young age that they shouldn't cry or show certain emotions, and the continuous bottling up of all those feelings more often than not manifests itself during the adolescent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that a race as advanced and intelligent as the one in Madoka\u2605Magica would have known this, and would have experimented with male Puella Magi as well, yet the story makes no reference to this. Quite the opposite in fact, and the explanation given states very clearly that all Puella Magi throughout history have been female.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before you ask, there are such things as male witches in the realm of the occult. They're called Warlocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe second flaw is the explanation given as to why Kaname Madoka has more potential than anyone else, which again makes a major, yet highly debatable assumption. The simple fact is that if one follows the idea to its rather logical conclusion, the most powerful Puella Magi should actually be Akemi Homura. It's a far more conceptual plot hole, but given the usage of the many worlds theory, especially at the end, it quickly becomes a major issue that could destroy the foundation of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's a good thing the series is as entertaining as it is.\\n\\n\r\nNow given that this is an anime by Shaft one might well expect a degree of experimentation with the visuals, and the opening sequence gives viewers some very clear signs of things to come. The character design is very similar to that of Hidamari Sketch, and while this adds a degree of cuteness to the show, it also emphasises the stark difference between the Puella Magi and the witches, especially in terms of their humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe experimental nature of the series is prevalent during the combat sequences, and Shaft really have gone to town in creating surreal, mind bending environments that serve as a home for the witches, and the arena in which the Puella Magi must fight. The mixture of animation techniques on display during these scenes is surprising, not only in terms of application but also in quality, which is why it's somewhat disappointing that there are occasions where entire frames have been left out of the animation during everyday events.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Madoka\u2605Magica is a good looking anime for the most part, even though much of the effort has been expended on crafting imaginatively unusual other world settings and surreal enemies for the girls to fight. Strangely, this may actually be purposeful as while the everyday environments are colourful yet mundane, like the character design these emphasise the difference between the real world and the one in which the Puella Magi must combat the witches.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Connect by ClariS, is a fairly uplifting J-pop song that's set against a surprisingly routine (for mahou shoujo anime), sequence, all of which belies the darkness of the story proper. Thankfully the ending theme, Magia by Kalafina, is more in keeping with the atmosphere of the anime, especially with the ephemeral approach to visuals. The series is also littered with a variety of background tracks that are generally appropriate in their usage, and one of the high points of Madoka\u2605Magica is the quality of the audio choreography.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the acting, the cast is made up of experienced seiyuu who add depth and nuance to proceedings, for example Kato Emiri's role as the amorally enigmatic Kyuubey really is something to see, especially with her off hand explanations and her ability to make the character sound devoid of emotion. The rest of the cast also perform very well, except for one, but the issue isn't actually with her skills. Yuuki Aoi (Kaname Madoka), generally works well with the other seiyuu and delivers her lines with a decent amount of passion, but she's unable to express the true depth of emotion that the character feels because the script simply does not allow for it, which is a shame as it's a minor blemish on a very good performance.\\n\\n\r\nScripting issues aside, it's interesting to note that the series seems a bit lacking in core characterisation, especially as Madoka, Sayaka, and Mami have personalities that verge on the mundane. It's this averageness that makes the story that little bit more accessible to audiences, even though some rather fantastic back stories have been used to justify the actions of one character or another. Which brings up an interesting issue with the developmental process as rather than try for an intuitive approach, Shaft and Aniplex have applied the \"growth by numbers\" method. Each character is given the opportunity to adversely affect Madoka in some way, and the order in which this occurs is dependent on the relationship between the two. The problem is that this methodical approach is in clear conflict with the experimental nature of the series, and while it can easily be overlooked or forgiven due to the entertaining nature of the story, it's still not what one would expect from a studio like Shaft.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that at first I was expecting nothing more than another cutesy mahou shoujo anime, so finding something that was more to my tastes was a bonus. That said, the series isn't without its flaws, but these can either be ignored outright or forgiven as the story is a very interesting and unusual take on what it means to be a magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just not as groundbreaking as some might believe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Madoka\u2605Magica may at first seem like a totally unique concept, it should be remembered that the Nanoha franchise possessed some dark themes, Black Rock Shooter featured a young girl's alter ego fighting strange creatures in a surreal other world, and Uta Kata tried to show the breakdown of a person who becomes controlled by their power. There are other shows that explore some of the themes of the series, sometimes in more detail, but in truth these are only minor niggles as Shaft have managed to create  a mahou shoujo anime that, like those that came before, successfully displays the true potential of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leaves only two questions. If Shaft wanted to experiment with the genre, then why not go the whole hog and have a mahou shounen? Why leave that sort of thing to comedy anime like Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka?",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka\u2606Magica managed to do what I thought was impossible - took over the position of my favorite TV anime series from the first Suzumiya Haruhi series, while still airing. And my rating of was only rising with every subsequent episode.\r\nEven though the story starts like any typical magical girl anime, you can clearly see it is going to be different from the very beginning - it is the girls' choice, not fate, to go on the path of magic. Being a magical girl is rather a cold business deal rather than a divine blessing. And magic is not a perfect cure for everything- using it can cause a strong and hard-to-predict backlash. All that is there as early as in the first two episodes. And then episode 3 happens, and while trying not to spoil the story, I must say that all hope of this series being a normal magical girl show is lost since then. Beginning with episode 3, Madoka\u2605Magica follows the Hitchcockian principles of storytelling - with every following episode there is some unpleasant surprise, we can't wait to see what happens next - oh, how convenient it will be for all those watching Madoka after the whole series' original airing...\\n\\n\r\nI can't really decide if I should call the story predictable or not. As you may know, the show has spawned an enormous amount of speculation and discussion on 2ch, 4chan and throughout the anime fandom in general. As the story went on, many of these speculations turned out to be true. When following the discussions on the Web, it's hard to tell if the story would be predictable to a lone viewer or not. But one thing is certain - Urobuchi and Shinbou managed to tell the story in such a way that even when you know what's going to happen, everything is still exciting and makes a huge emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nAll of us fans were anticipating the finale, with much speculation about the ending going on. Since the actual last episode aired, opinion about the ending varies greatly between the fans - but my personal opinion is that the ending is as great as the whole show. Of course I won't go as far as to explain the ending, but what actually makes the ending good is its... well, I'd say ambiguity, but it's on a meta-level. There are ongoing discussions even whether the ending is ambiguous or not! It makes you think, interpret it your own way, and no thought is better than any other - but at the same time, it is not an open ending, the story is completely concluded. It is truly a sign of very good writing by Urobuchi Gen. It's often said that Madoka is the same to the magical girls genre what Evangelion was to the mecha genre years ago. And I won't be surprised if it'll end up becoming a cult classic of comparable caliber.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is heavily character-driven, with many events happening because of the characters revealing their feelings to each other. Even though many characters are quite clear from the beginning, nothing is certain, as the world - and other characters - constantly turn out to be different than we all thought. There is no white and black, characters are deep and believable, which is certainly one of the key factors of this show's enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is quite unusual for Shaft, because it is very serious in atmosphere. There is not much comedy, and when there is, it's very subtle and natural in tone. This also means we won't be seeing Shaft's signature walls of flashing text and pushy creative typography (it's still there, though, in much less obtrusive form of runes). The art still manages to be very \"Shafty\" in tone, however. Slightly futuristic backgrounds, heavily inspired by recent architecture of the real world, look quite similar to what we've seen in Bakemonogatari - but are usually less symbolic and significantly more polished. The characters were designed by Aoki Ume of Hidamari Sketch fame, and bear significant resemblance to that series. Such bright and happy character designs may feel out of place for a series so dark in tone, but it's aiming for an effect much similar to what Higurashi did few years ago - and it actually works here, too. Unusual proportions of Aoki's drawings feel a bit strange at the beginning, but it's easy to get used to it after an episode or two, and then both background and foreground art blend well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe closed worlds where witches reside, deserve a separate paragraph. Shaft employed Gekidan Inu Curry for this part, and their creative potential truly shines there. The art is very abstract, animated with stop-motion and similar techniques, feeling considerably out of place, while still working out well. These visuals are often compared to opening animations of Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei seasons by fans, and Shaft's fans should recall this kind of art in other works of this studio, too.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about voice acting is not really much necessary - there are many well-known and popular names in the cast, which alone gives some degree of warranty for the quality. The voices match respective characters' personalities well, too. There's nothing much more I can say about that. The music, on the other hand - it really adds up to the overall feel. The opening theme by ClariS (known for OreImo OP) builds up a nice innocent atmosphere... soon to be brutally broken by the plot and BGM, composed by Kajiura Yuki, best known as the founder of Kalafina - who also performs the outstanding ending theme - and for Kara no Kyoukai's soundtrack. Her instantly recognizable style fits astonishingly well with Madoka's atmosphere, and builds both a considerable tension and atmosphere of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGMs, though well-fitting, didn't stand out much for me at first. But with the progress of the story, with the mood getting darker and story more absorbing, the music also started to make more impact and I can even say that it has become catchy. The style of the soudtrack also shifts significantly during the finale, which makes it feel even more epic. Overall, I don't know if the whole OST will be worth owning, but there are few tunes which I'd really like to have is my music collection.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Puella Magi Madoka\u2606Magica has got everything a good visual entertainment should have. I can only deplore that anime is somewhat looked down on outside the otaku community, because I truly believe that anime non-fans would also enjoy it. And the title sounds somewhat embarassing, too - but it's a perfect proof for that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nEdits:\\n\r\nMarch 12th - updated after episode 10.\\n\r\nMarch 14th - reworded some fragments according to a reader's notes.\\n\r\nApril 23rd - updated after the final episodes.",

            "content": "We all have things in life that we treasure and hold close, whether it be friends, family, possessions, dreams, or just life itself. We tell ourselves that we will do everything in our power to preserve them, that we would never risk betting and losing them. But what, one day, you were given the opportunity to be granted a wish? A miracle, with no limits, that could give you something that you always wanted. Would you be willing to risk losing everything, the things you treasure, your humanity, and even your life, to have that one wish granted? If you would, would you regret it,would you curse it, or would you fight to protect it? Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Puella Magi Madoka Magica, whichever you prefer, centers around these questions and gives us an outlandish tale of love and friendship, and how it can all disappear in the blink of an eye. Madoka, or \"Dokes\" as the internet now loves/hates to call it, has become a phenomenon in the anime community since it's release in 2011, garnering endless praise and a massive fandom in Japan and in the West, and like all popular works, the question that always arises is, does it deserve it? Well let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn a vague futuristic city in Japan, lives a girl named Madoka Kaname. She's entirely ordinary, and not very talented, but she treasures her life nonetheless and loves her family and friends entirely. But one day a mysterious transfer student named Homura Akemi gives her a warning, that if she truly loves her life and the people around her, that she shouldn't do anything that would change it. Her warning quickly becomes prevalent as she meets a mysterious being in the shape of a cute fuzzy entity named Kyubey that offers to turn her and her friends into magical girls. They will be granted one wish to gain these powers and in return they will be obligated to fight the witches that hide in the shadows of their city. Then..... well i can't really say. Basically everything that follows that basic description could be labeled as a spoiler, so if you want to know more, i suggest you watch the series for yourself. Hint though, if you're familiar with the works of Faust and Hans Christian Andersen, you might get some kind of clue as to what goes on.  After 3 years since its premiere, it's common knowledge now that Madoka is not the moe fluff that it appears to be. There are many fans out there that will describe the show as a dark subversion that deconstructs the magical girl genre, and to this claim, i say that it's true. In the first two minutes of the anime, Madoka shows that it's not the happy-go-lucky magical girl anime from our childhoods, but a dark story that, along the way, points at some of the flaws and inconsistencies of the magical girl genre. But the thing is, Madoka is not good because it's a dark subversion. Madoka is good because it's terrifically written and has ended up being one of the few good modern tragedie. Nothing the show presents to us feels arbitrary or manipulative, but it feels inevitable, as though there was no way around it, even though our own ideals hoped that reality would stop crashing down on these girls. Of course this only works because the writing in the show is airtight, filled with foreshadowing, both subtle and obvious, and not wasting a single moment on scenes that could be considered meaningless filler, there is purpose to every interaction and every conversation. In fact there's so much detail in these short 12 episodes, that it doesn't just give it rewatch value, but it practically demands to be watched more than once, and from personal experience, it just gets better with each viewing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Madoka was done by Studio Shaft, a studio known for it's high animation quality and obtuse visuals, and who i personally dislike for their vanity. Yet, i acknowledge good work when i see it, and to say their work on Madoka is just good is an understatement. Madoka's design has one thing that most moe shows lack, distinction. Their color palate, their ordinary pastels made extraordinary by crayon tones, and a certain flexibility that makes you really appreciate the work put into it. Not to say anything about the ever present city itself, large in scale, and containing areas both lavish and hollow. As the series progresses, the city continually gets more bleak and ill-boding to fit the tone, yet never losing the presence that it's had since the first episode. Still the highlight of the shows visuals is easily the witches labyrinths. Each of them is abnormal, outlandish, and unique with different themes and designs for each one, like one is designed after a hospital, another looks like a scrap book, and my personal favorite is where everyone in the labyrinth is depicted as a silhouette. It's unorthodox to it's core, and like the city, only gets more grim and uncomfortable as the series progresses. Not to say anything about the animation which meets the usual Shaft standards of high quality, with fluid and fast paced action scenes, and the notorious \u201csideways glance\u201d that we see in every single Shaft anime. Madoka is art from anyway you look at it, and it's visuals to good to match it. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe score for the show was done by, Yuki Kajiura. Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks are well known for shedding a tear or two, and Madoka is no different. With a glorious blend of synths and electric orchestra's, weeping strings and piano, and, of course, a towering choir, the soundtrack to Madoka is attention getting to say the least. Haunting, mysterious, and at times sad, needless to say, the OST is good, almost too good in fact. It's actually kind of hard to talk about the soundtrack because it's, honestly, just something you have to listen to for yourself. As for voice acting, i'll have to go sub over dub. It's kind of hard for me to judge Japanese voice acting since, I myself, do not speak Japanese, but still, it's not hard to notice a great performance when you hear one. In Madoka, it just so happens, that all of the actors are equally great, both subtle and overwrought for whichever situation. As for the dub, well, it's listenable. To be fair, it's not a bad dub, but it's not very natural sounding and very wooden on places. I will give special props to Cassandra Lee Morris for her performance as Kyubey. She obviously got what kind of character it was and captured its essence enough to rival its Japanese counterpart. If you prefer dubs then go ahead, the dub doesn't really do anything to hurt it, but i recommend the Japanese track. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs a tragedy, Madoka only works to it's fullest with the stellar cast of characters they provide, although it may not seem that way from an limited standpoint. By limited standpoint, i mean those who follow a formula to judge what makes a character, one such as \"background A + situation B = reaction C\" characterization\", rather them what's in front of you. The characters are humanized beyond their archtypes and over time, things like motivations change and the characters are corrupted by a situation that, despite being ideal candidates for, none of them were mentally, physically, or emotionally prepared for. Of course, in classic tragic fashion, the situation was a near impossible one that could've been avoided, if not for their own personal flaws. Their naivete, their desperation, their love, their desire, even things that seem like good attributes like kindness and courage prove to be more harmful than they seem. This is brought out through the contrast of the rookie magical girls and the veterans, those who went in with hope and the best of intentions, and those who have learned the hard way about the price of being a magical girl. Of course this applies to all the main cast, except for two. The first being out ordinary protagonist, Madoka, who consistently goes through the series with a justified indecisiveness towards becoming a magical girl, feeling the guilt of not doing her part, but fearing for what will come when she makes her wish. Her natural sense of what's right and what isn't, her own insecurities, and being witness to the consequences that unfold is what ultimately drives her character throughout the series, slowly building her up until the climax, and while she isn't the best of the characters, she is the one most suited for being the main protagonist. Then there's Kyubey, who i sadly can't go into much detail over, so i'll just give you the gist of it. Kyubey is the representation of logic versus emotion, and the needs of the many versus the needs of the one. It's indifferent towards the ideas of good and evil and acts however it feels is necessary to get what's needed. The mere fact that i've been using it for Kyubey, over him or her, should be indication that Kyubey is more than it originally seems. There's not much to talk about outside of the main cast, as there's only 6 other characters that aren't just nameless background fodder, but they still contribute their fair share to the story. The conversations between Madoka and her mother Junko often reveal a lot, how close they are, how much Madoka admires her, and often works as vessels for foreshadowing, and were always interesting to watch. Madoka and Sayaka's friend Hitomi is another story. She's not a bad character, but her switch from comic relief to super serious seemed a bit sudden, but even that's just a nitpick. The characters is Madoka are surprisingly complex and give off more than enough humanity to make this series exceed expectations. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi has stated in interviews that his intention with Madoka was to make an interesting, thought-provoking, fantasy set in an established genre. Did he succeed? More than i could've ever expected. Madoka is a masterfully written modern tragedy that works on par with classic european literature. Some may claim that Madoka is nothing more than shock factor with cute girls designed to be an instant hit, to which i recommend you rewatch it since you missed the point of what the series is about in the first place. As for others, while i can't guarantee that you'll like the series as much as i do, as with any other work, but i recommend you watch it, sooner than later. Few series seems to hit every target, from characters, to story, to themes, and work every way, inside and out, to make a series as, for lack of a better word, perfect. Anyways, that's all for now, til next time.",

            "content": "I feel like I'm in the minority here on MAL, and that's kinda depressing. Madoka Magica by and large is one of those programmes which receives no shortage of praise that I simply can't agree with one way or the other. I wouldn't mind it so much were it not for the fact that any sort of valid criticism or complaints anyone has with this series is instantly lost in a sea of downvotes and angry rants made by rabid fans who're breathing heavily whilst typing on their keyboards rapidly. Regardless, I'll make a feeble attempt at getting my voice heard. Will it work? Probablynot, but it's still worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really baffles me is how Madoka Magica is a moe drama along the lines of Elfen Lied and yet people praise Madoka ad nauseum whilst talking shit about Elfen Lied at every available opportunity. Even people like JesuOtaku who generally have no patience for moe dramas ended up giving this programme a glowing review despite the fact that Madoka Magica and Elfen Lied end up trying to accomplish similar goals. It's amazing as to how much the power of emotions can override one's better judgement but then again, maybe that's why I couldn't get into it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just get this out of the way first: moe drama by and large is an extremely manipulative genre at its core that's rather poorly written in general. Why is this the case? Well, the writers know all too well that most viewers will gladly put up with all this shit so long as they get their cute girls in anguish that they can fantasise about consoling and/or fucking. Obviously, Madoka Magica has quite a way's worth of better writing put into it than Elfen Lied does but it still falls prey to the same traps that plague moe drama when it comes down to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first biggest problem that Madoka Magica has is the fact that the pacing is horrendously rushed. I don't care what you have to say about the pacing, because quite frankly... it's shit. The 12 episodes we were given did not allow for the events taking place in the story to flow naturally and instead make this programme come off as a rather forced melodrama. Something is horrendously wrong with your programme if I cannot bring myself to feel even the slightest modicum of emotion for what transpires despite the characters making a big deal of it all.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the rushed pacing, another glaring flaw that Madoka Magica suffers from is the fact that it's heavily reliant on shock value, which is probably another big reason as to why this anime is so lauded in the first place. Shock is a powerful emotion indeed and it can definitely work to great effect to further strengthen the writing whenever necessary. The problem is that Madoka Magica goes out of its way to shock the viewer and then ultimately relies on manipulating your emotions to keep you invested and distract you from the flaws in the writing. People are definitely going to disagree with me on this one but please hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe way Madoka Magica's been marketed in the past by Aniplex is a dead giveaway that shock value is a major cornerstone of Madoka Magica as a whole. The trailers, the OP, and even the blurb on the back of the Aniplex DVD release basically paint this show out to be your typical magic girl show despite the fact that it couldn't be further from the truth. Granted, a lot of the punch has been taken out of that sort of marketing tactic given that Madoka has become so popular to the point where it's essentially common knowledge that this is a dark, angst-ridden magic girl melodrama but the point still stands.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like Madoka Magica was fundamentally designed to be a smash hit. The very combination of shock and moe drama has been a proven formula for success (look at Elfen Lied if you want an example). However, Madoka Magica takes this a step further by being a magic girl show. Magic girl programmes (and battle shonens to a similar extent) suffer from this \"image\" that exists in the minds of most people as nothing more than childish drivel about friendship and idealism that can't grow the fuck up. Given the fact that Madoka Magica is a shocking moe drama as well as a magic girl show, the end result is basically having thousands of fans saying that Madoka isn't like other magic girl shows and is a definite must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Madoka isn't like most other magic girl programmes but then again, neither is Kill la Kill or Princess Tutu. A series doesn't automatically become a masterpiece just because it \"breaks the mould\" as the saying goes. If that were the case, films like \"The Room\" would have to be considered masterpieces of drama despite evidence to the contrary. Don't get me wrong: individuality in anime is a good thing, especially given all the repetition going on in the industry. What isn't good is relying on being different to be your main selling point. This isn't to say that Madoka doesn't have any other merits to stand on, rather the very merits it does have are flawed to high heaven.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is often praised to no end as a deconstruction of magic girl anime. Yeah... I don't buy it. You mean to tell me that all it takes to be a deconstruction is psychologically torturing your characters whilst going out of your way to be as dark and edgy as possible? I thought there was more subtlety involved with the writing when it comes down to deconstructions. Say what you will about Evangelion, but one thing that Gainax has that SHAFT lacks in its entirety is tact. Don't get me wrong, subtlety isn't exactly Evangelion's strong suit either but it certainly has more than Madoka does, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWe got to spend a good deal of time in our typical mech setting before shit got morbid and we realised that being a mecha pilot in the world of Eva isn't a walking sex fantasy. Sure, Evangelion sends us flying head-first into the plot like Madoka does, but once again: we're given time to actually connect with the characters which is something that Madoka's 12-episode runtime simply doesn't allow for. I understand that the length of a show isn't necessarily indicative of whether or not the characters are good because there definitely are 1-cour programmes that deliver quite a bit on the character front (i.e. White Album 2, OreGairu, Usagi Drop, etc). At the same time, this story contains far too much content for it to actually work with the 1-cour length.\\n\\n\r\nI know that some people like to tout this 12-episode length as a strength, saying that it's free from all the unnecessary bullshit that plagues other magic girl shows and goes straight into the good stuff. While I can certainly reciprocate that praise to a certain degree (especially given that Madoka Magica is far more engaging than Sailor Moon is), people fail to understand that without the boring parts of a show, the good bits wouldn't be nearly as good and would instead become mediocre. Princess Tutu understood this concept quite well as it was able to balance out the otherwise boring bits about ballet with the deliciously macabre moments involving Drosselmeyer. Madoka has no such balance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that the 1-cour length brings up is an over-reliance on plot twists. Now, plot twists aren't inherently bad and can definitely work to the show's advantage if it was given proper foreshadowing. Unfortunately, the short length doesn't allow for foreshadowing of any kind to really happen so they just take you by surprise (oh look, more shock value!). I don't know about you, but these plot twists don't do much of anything for me. In fact, it made me question the logic behind this show even more. I'd question why shit had to constantly get worse for the characters in every episode, but then I remember that this is moe drama and that it doesn't matter how nihilistic the world actually gets so long as we still have our cute girls writhing in anguish.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really surprises me about Madoka is the fact that despite being a sadistic viewer who loves seeing cute things being crushed by nihilism, this show was enough to make *me* do a double take on what's being shown. Make no mistake: I couldn't find myself feeling any modicum of emotion (not even pity) for Madoka, Homura, Sayaka, Kyoko, and Mami but at the same time... there was just something rather unnerving about how their circumstances just kept getting worse by the minute. It doesn't help that the short length also brings up stuff that may very well qualify as fridge horror or unfortunate implications (I don't know which trope it is, so bear with me).\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the fact that magic girls have to be adolescents because apparently, they're emotionally volatile at that age range brings up so many questions that just don't get answered. For one thing, does this mean that boys that are of the same age don't go through emotional turmoil like teenage girls do? What of teenage girls who happen to suffer from psychological disorders/trauma? Why does Kyubi opt to only focus on teenage girls when there are many other people of both genders across all age ranges that are just as emotionally volatile if not moreso? There's also the concept of power with a price.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole \"power with a price\" concept is not uncommon in TV, film, manga, comics, literature, etc and there have been many twists on the same formula. Madoka tries to do this concept but it doesn't go all the way with it because of the lack of world-building. Because of that, it would seem that the price the girls have to pay is unending psychological torture which is all somehow the girls' faults by the end of it all. Basically, Madoka's flat-out telling you that you're fucked if you decide to remain a Muggle because you're going to die regardless and yet you're fucked if you become a magic girl because it means you'll go through continuous psychological torment. At the same time, it's also telling you that you'd be much better off as a Muggle because of the fact that you're going to die a lonely, merciless death where nobody's going to remember you if you choose to be a magic girl.\\n\\n\r\nNow I could bring up the whole wish fallacy argument that plagues other shows that involve wishing, but then you have to remember that all the wishes that the girls made in Madoka horribly backfired because apparently, the wishes that the girls made were really selfish even though they seemed selfless at first. Even if Madoka herself was to make a wish like being able to grant her own wishes exactly as she intends for them to come out, there's no telling how horribly it can backfire because the world this show takes place in is an extremely cruel and nihilistic one. This actually brings me over to another problem I have with the show: how sexist it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nI don't consider myself a feminist of any flavour, nor can I say whether or not a specific programme is female-positive media because I'm a guy. At the same time, I don't understand how people can just let all this bullshit slide. Have people forgotten that women have been pressured for millennia to be as selfless as possible and to put their own desires to the side? What's so wrong about wanting to be with the person you love? What's so wrong about not wanting to die or to actually eat something for dinner? Madoka's logic in and of itself is something that really just doesn't sit right with me one way or the other.\\n\\n\r\nAm I reading too much into Madoka? I don't even know at this point, but there's no denying that there are many fundamental flaws that exist within Madoka Magica as a whole. However, there's this one aspect of Madoka that never ceases to piss me off more than anything else and that's how it ends. For a show that spends 11 episodes psychologically torturing its characters, I'd expect for the show to at least end on a downright depressing note but that's not the case at all. In fact, Madoka Magica's ending couldn't be happier. Fans like to say that the ending wasn't completely happy, but we all know that the circumstances the ending presents to us are infinitely better than what Homura et al had to put up with for the bulk of this show's run. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand how a show can simply spend 11 episodes saying that ideals will only result in permanent suffering only to do a complete 180 at the final episode and say that hope, happiness, and whatnot will always prevail. Then again, Madoka Magica IS a moe drama and we all know that moe dramas wouldn't be as successful if they don't end on *some* semblance of a happy note (I'm looking at YOU, Clannad: After Story!). One thing's for certain though, this ending is something that I take umbrage with on so many levels because it just forces a happy ending out of nowhere, which is the kind of ending that I really just can't stand.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Madoka Magica is certainly an interesting beast to tackle indeed. I wouldn't call it average in the slightest because it managed to evoke this much of a reaction out of me and it's definitely a cut above the more typical entries of the magic girl genre. At the same time, this show gets far too much praise than it actually deserves. I'm not saying it's terrible, because it really isn't and I suppose you'll have a good time watching it if you don't read too much into the story. Regardless, I don't think Madoka Magica is a \"good\" show. Feedback is always welcome, so with that... I'm gonna start barricading my house so that you rabid Madoka fans don't come at me with the intentions to kill me. Peace.",

            "content": "\u201cAs much as I wished for the happiness of one, someone else must be equally cursed. That\u2019s how the story of a magical girl goes\u2026\u201d\r\nI finally understand why one should not judge a book by its cover.  To be honest, I never liked the design of the characters in Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and I\u2019m sure there are those out there (like me) who may be skeptical with this show due to that fact alone.  I mean \u2026 doesn\u2019t the swollen, flattened, wide, and overblown faces turn you off?  It sure did for me.  But boy, I cannot describe how glad Iam now after marathoning Madoka\u2605Magica in two days (despite all the assignments, projects, and exam deadlines)!\\n\\n\r\nSo what can you expect out of this show?  Certainly not the typical magical girl story one would be expecting.  Taking place in a futuristic world, the story started off like most other magical girl series.  School setting, bunch of young girls hanging around together, the typical \u201chappy care-free\u201d life.  But that quickly changed as the pace of the story drastically increased as well as the mood darkens at the same time.  Soon the viewers are engulfed with deep hatred and sorrow and a wide range of emotions that will only leave one hanging and lust for more.  To say Madoka\u2605Magica is an emotionally driven show is not an overstatement.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is just as brilliant as the story itself.  With the new junior high duo ClariS doing the opening theme and Kalafina doing the ending theme, that should automatically ring some bell for some hardcore anime followers.  But putting the fame of these singer groups aside, both the opening and ending theme songs for Madoka\u2605Magica are just splendid in itself.  You know how some songs have to grow on you; where you need time to get used to it and even then, it might not be catchy enough for you to fell in love with?  Rests assure there is no such problem with neither the opening nor ending themes for this show.  As if that is not enough, Yuki Kajiura-sama herself is responsible for the BGM, theme song lyrics, and composition!  We all know how emotionally driven her music can be, certainly one of the greatest musician in the industry to date.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Can\u2019t really say there is a lot of character \u201cgrowth\u201d, BUT, I can safely say they have enormous depth making them more believable and lovable.  The depth mainly comes from the background stories of the girls.  Viewers will find out why each girl chose to become a magical girl and how they live with their choice afterward.  If you are a keen viewer, perhaps you may even be able to see through what each girl represents symbolically and relate their experience throughout the show with our own daily lives.  On that note, I have to give the production studios (SHAFT and Aniplex) credit for a job well done as well as finding the appropriate seiyu to voice cast the respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn to our last topic, it\u2019s also one that I have briefly mentioned in the beginning.  Yup, it is regarding the animation of Madoka\u2605Magica.  Surely most of us are familiar with SHAFT and its style of production, but not everyone accepts the way SHAFT handle its own anime.  While one can argue that SHAFT is being creative with their work, which certainly differentiates them from other studio, but for the everyday norm like my humble self I cannot say I appreciate their work of mixing reality into anime to create something nightmare-ish.  By that I do not mean the incorporation of real city sceneries into the anime, but rather, I am referring to the infrequent random usage of flowers, candies, or butterflies that takes away any seriousness to the show.  Perhaps I just don\u2019t understand \u201cart\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I wish to say that as an anime original work (not adapted from light novel or manga like many anime these days), Mahou Shoujo Madoka \u2605Magica certainly deserves some praise.  If I were to describe the excitement level of this show, the closest I can think of is a mathematical exponential curve.  The early episodes serve as the typical story foundation blocks, but right after that is done, you can sure as hell expect an emotional rollercoaster ride =D",

            "content": "Forget everything you thought you knew about the magical girl genre, because Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or MSMM as I'll call it from here on for simplicity) is here to turn the genre upside down.\r\nAt its core, MSMM is a--like its title says--mahou shoujo.  But it's what the series does with the genre that makes it something truly marvelous; the magic is in the execution.  In the beginning, it may seem like any other, set up to be generally innocent, light-hearted, nonchalant, and fun; but by the time ED begins at the end of episode 3, the monster will be revealed for whatit truly is, and its true nature will be fully in the light.\\n\\n\r\nI imagine MSMM's story like a tightly-woven rope kept perfectly taut:  There are multiple sub-stories and issues going on at the same time, but they stay so close together that it may be difficult for one to discern them as individual pieces of the overall work.  Unlike anime whose rope is loosely-woven or frayed (divided into clearly discernable arcs or things don't tie together well) or that curve or coil (ones that lose their way and stray from their path), MSMM stays concise, linear, and tight.  Everything stays together, and it knows exactly where it's going; it's ultimately all the same story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is consistent and fast; you will definitely be riveted to the edge of your seat.  To some, it may be a tiny bit *too* fast, but I pose that this is because of the distinct lack of \"fluff\": everything is significant--nothing is pointless.  The story is lean and completely free of excess fat.  It picks its direction and chugs there headlong.  It does a perfect job balancing the crucial elements of character development, plot progression, dialog, psychology, action, and emotional tension.  Balancing this many aspects is no small feat, and MSMM is second to none at the job.\\n\\n\r\nEqually as strong and as critical to the series is the cast--also free of excess fat.  It is compact and devoid of unnecessary characters; all of them have a clearly defined role and bounds they do not overstep.  The screen time is allotted appropriately between them.  Each character has a distinct personality and already has depth to them before any development even needs to occur, and the personality that is set up beforehand helps the development they undergo stand out.  Each of the magical girls are unique and go through their own trials and ordeals, which also affect each other; each plays integral roles in shaping other characters and progressing the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe tribulations the magical girls are subjected to is what MSMM is really all about.  They--and you as the viewer--are revealed truths about what it means to be a magical girl that you never would've dreamed of.  The psychological trauma they endure is painted on a dark and cynical canvas of reality for you to experience along with them; the joys and pains as the bonds of friendship are created and strengthened, strained and broken, will play with your heart strings.  If you didn't know what it meant to be sympathetic before, consider this your crash course.\\n\\n\r\nComplementing the anime is a beautiful and stunning OST composed by Yuki Kajiura.  There is always the perfect track to accompany every scene--whether the mood be light-hearted, sad, ominous/foreboding, or exciting/thrilling, you can be guaranteed that the music will be there to help burn the feeling into your heart.  The OP (\"Connect\") is great and serves as a constant reminder of the false sense of security constructed in the early episodes; the ED (\"Magia\") is phenomenal and much more accurately reflects MSMM's true nature (it's also used strategically during a couple scenes in the series, to great effect).  There are some pretty intense sound effects utilized--particularly noteworthy are crashing noises and explosions.  The seiyuu do a stunning job delivering their lines with the perfect levels of emotion and energy.  They make their characters come to life so much so that one may think they've BECOME the character.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may be slightly put off by the somewhat different character designs with their wider faces, but you'll get used to it easily.  The animation in general is pretty spectacular, except for a few scenes where characters are shown coming \"towards us\" and end up looking like they're walking in place.  Other than that, motions are fluid, and action flows wonderfully.  The cinematography is definitely above average, with some pretty creative and interesting camera angles and close-ups.  There is some particularly stunning artwork shown briefly, usually in transitioning from one scene to another--dank, cold alleys; bright blue and green neon bus stops; vibrant, warm, orange sunsets; the glow of lamp posts in the twilight; sprawling gray cityscapes under the shadow of a gathering storm.  One thing I found particularly outstanding was the brilliant use of low-key and ambient lighting:  The lighting harmonizes with the background music to create truly engrossing and vibrant scenes.  Indeed, the manner in which the sound and visuals syngergize with each other creates an immersive and dark stage for events to play out upon.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you haven't caught the drift already, MSMM is an extremely enjoyable experience with substantial rewatch value.  It's one of those rare works that get MORE enjoyable the more you watch it, unlike many whose flaws become more evident, or eventually get old.  Genius incorporation of foreshadowing is so tactful and subtle that you might not even realize it was there until you watch it again.  (Like I said, everything is significant.)  I personally found the entire cast growing on me more and more each time through (except for Kyuubey, because he's a manipulative bastard, but still well-done nonetheless).\\n\\n\r\nMSMM offers much: friendship, drama, psychology, action, story, character development, emotional involvement, and even music and animation--like I said, all working together and balanced beautifully, with no one aspect ever dominating the others: complete harmony.  It's the only anime I'm able to honestly give perfect scores across the board for.  But does that mean YOU will like it?  As I've stated, it's mostly a dark and edgy series with characters enduring intense psychological strain and hardship, and there are times when happiness and hope seem impossible.  The night is darkest just before the dawn, but if you don't think you can take the night, then MSMM probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you CAN handle it, though, by all means:  WATCH THIS SERIES.  It's a deep, exciting, shocking, and powerful ride from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is a smart and yet cursed show. Many including myself have applauded the show for being a brilliant take and twist on the magical girl genre, a genre that is usually meant to be an inspiration to kids. Madoka Magica changes this concept of Magical Girls by making it realistic. Fighting monsters (or witches in this case) would be a dangerous task in our reality and that is the case in point Madoka Magica tries to bring forward. A great idea on the part of the creators but unfortunately some great ideas can only go too far and the story suffers a bitas a result.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it is the characters that are the best part of the anime. Sayaka, Homura, Mami, and Kyoko are all fascinating to watch and each have their own layered characterization and moral philosophical themes that drive the story forward. Themes such as individual dreams, wishes, societal views and conflicts, relationships, etc... It's all so fascinating and brilliantly told. What is even more amazing about the characters is that they develop not only through great dialogue but also through visual means as well. Characters will change stance and opinions but the audience needs to pay attention to facial expressions and character actions throughout the show in order to determine where and when these amazing characters grew. The main protagonist Madoka is probably the most straight forward character of the bunch. She's definitely less fascinating than the rest of the cast but she is still fun to watch due to her kind nature and expressive personality. She believes herself as being a coward who can't help people, but low and behold she ends up being the smartest, wisest, and bravest of the show. She's a fine character and role model, but not a very deep one. Another little problem I had with the show is the adults of the world are all morons. How come the teenagers are the ones talking smart and philosophical while the adults are the unbalanced irresponsible weirdos who have no clue about anything? Also, there is some questionable character morals that will make you scratch your head and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to be frightened/traumatized, but they are still interesting to ponder about none the less.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILER*\\n\r\nFinally we must talk about Kyubey, who is probably one of the greatest villains ever to appear in an anime. This little cat like alien is fascinating in so many ways. He deceits, plots, scams, and lies all the way through the entire series all the while always having a permanent smile on his face (creepy). He tortures and plays around with the lives of these little girls all to further his plans, plans that are a bit understandable but completely unacceptable in the method that he's doing it in. He is the stark contrast of the usual talking cat side kick character found in magical girl shows which is once again the writers trying to play with our expectations. I love this villain yet hate him for being such an awful manipulator. This is exactly how amazing villains should be written.\\n\r\n*END OF MINOR SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nBut now unfortunately we must talk about the curse of the show and how the magical girl theme while being its strength is also its weakness. The reason the Magical Girls genre is targeted to kids is because the premise is meant to make kids feel like they can be heroes with good moral values, but in a realistic premise it is simply ridiculous and implausible. It is also at points very silly because intricate plot details and philosophy concepts are being discussed by teenage girls, girls who have probably only recently been through puberty. There are many times when I simply laughed at serious smart plot discussions because I couldn't believe little girls were talking about such things. Just the concept of Magical Girls itself is ludicrous and yes, the story does try to explain why an alien cat would give little girls powers of incredible strength but it unsurprisingly doesn't make any sense and feels forced. The conclusion as well is a very lame and predictable anime plot ending. I don't want to spoil it but all I got to say is, \"I bow down to our lord and savior Madoka, the perfect moral being!\".\\n\\n\r\nA part from these main gripes in the story, the rest of it is very good. The plot moves along with the character development very well and the main themes of the story are well handled. Themes such as natural order, space and time, etc.. all come together exceptionally well with the themes of the characters in order to create a very fascinating 12 episode anime series. The art is also very good but nothing too exceptional. It does its job well by showing us the character feelings and expressions, but it never \"wowed\" me in any way. I also never got used to the casts chubby looking faces (but that's just a bias opinion). I will say that the art style works well in order to create a magical girl feeling and the action was very well handled. The sound was also amazing in the show. The openings and endings of Madoka Magica worked in with the themes and moods of the series, and I found it very intelligent in how they used it. For example, the ending song of the first two episodes are very happy sounding melodies, which fit in with the happy magical girl mood the show first puts on. But then the third episode is where the series becomes serious and violent, thus it plays with the audience by having the ending song sounding dark and depressing as if it is stating, \"prepare yourselves people because things are about to change\". I like it when shows play around with music like that. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend Madoka Magica to any anime fan. It is a brilliant and adult like take on the magical girl genre. It takes the stereotypes and reverses it. As I explained before, there are limitations to the reversing of this genre, but it is none the less a brilliant effort that deserves praise.",

            "content": "From all the trailers and ads that Aniplex and Shaft released for Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, it seemed that it would be your typical magic girl show, a show along the lines of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura. However, this had to be purposely orchestrated, as the show is nothing like that and it is clear from it's marketing that Aniplex wanted to surprise people with it, and they did a hell of a job.\r\nThis anime takes everything you know and love/hate about the magical girl genre and flips it 180. The plot starts off with your typical 'Magical Girl' traits and cliches, but soon takesa turn for the dire. This anime's story is dark, really dark. It tackles issues and questions that should, but never really do, arise in other magical girl anime. Though previous magical girl anime have had dark aspects to them, all in all those aspects have never been dark to this extent. The darker than average plot comes as a shock to the viewer that was expecting another cutesy moe anime, but got something totally different. The story is rather complex, and the answers are not given to you. Meaning that you have to figure everything out for yourself, this might be a good/bad thing, depending on your taste. I personally found the story very enjoyable and intriguing. I was not all that fond of the ending mind you and I felt that they could of done a better job with it, but I think that's up to personal preference if nothing else. And it did not break my experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably the show's weakest aspect. They get plenty of development, but as the show goes on, their actions just become more and more unrealistic. I personally liked all the characters, and didn't find anyone annoying or not needed. I also liked their development, and didn't really care for their unrealistic actions. This again depends whether or not you let this kind of thing affect you. Seeing as I'm a sucker for messed up characters, I found Miki Sayaka to be highly enjoyable, and definitely my favorite character of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is great, studio Shaft did a splendid job with the character design and how they contrast the otherwise dark story. Although for some it might be the total opposite, and the characters might reduce your enjoyment of the show. This again is up to personal preference though. The anime gets really gorgeous if you watch it in BD quality. Shaft are known to rush out their products, but they are also known for polishing them up for the Blu-Ray release. So, if possible, do try and watch this show on Blu-Ray, as the animation is vastly improved and adds a lot to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by none other than the masterful Yuki Kajiura. It contains pieces that range from cutesy moe-like themes, to intense battle choruses. And the ending song in particular is very memorable. One thing to note though is that parts of the OST sound really similar to other Yuki Kajiura works. So for instance if you've watcher Kara No Kyoukai, you will hear a lot of similarities, to the point where you can replace songs with one another from both shows, and it wouldn't matter. A minor nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all  Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is a great anime, and a must watch for anyone that is interested in the psychological genre. It's not the best at what it does, but it comes close to the heavy hitting contenders.",

            "content": "Madoka! An anime that has gotten tons of hype before its initial airing, even more hype once it started, and said hype went through multiple figurative roofs after everyone had watched the first three episodes. Truly this anime has become a phenomena and its just as interesting to watch everyone clamor around it as much as watching the show itself. A little context first though, a while back everyone was whispering about a possible Shaft Mahou Shoujo project with Akiyuki Shinbou attached as the director. In of itself, it wasn't too eyebrow-raising asides from the fact that Shinbou had directed the first season of Nanoha(another Mahou Shoujo series that subverts a lot of the genre's tropes). Nope nobody was really interested until it was revealed that Gen Urobuchi was doing the writing and series composition, Ume Aoki was doing the original character designs and Yuki Kajiura was composing the music. Ignoring Kajiura and Shinbou, simply mentioning that Urobuchi and Aoki were attached was absolutely baffling. I mean one is famed for his grimdark writing style and the other is known for her disgustingly cute drawing style, it doesn't really take a genius to figure out that this anime would be something different. So the hype machine took off and here we are months later all caught up in the veritable frenzy this anime has left in its wake week after week. Does it deserve all the love and the praise it gets? Let's see! \\n\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi is known for a lot of crap, mostly for being one of the writers for Nitroplus and by proxy the brains behind Saya no Uta (a Visual Novel). Now if you haven't read it, I strongly recommend you do. It isn't particularly long so take a few hours out of your schedule and just read through the whole thing in one sitting. You'll thank me for it later. I'm mentioning this because there are a lot of similarities between SnU and Madoka, particularly in the overall themes that are presented in both works. The particular things I'm looking for are mainly subversion and corruption/perversion, which Madoka is rife with. Urobuchi's style really shines when he takes something that is considered sacred and paints in a horrific manner. In this case, he's taking Mahou Shoujo and painting it in the same colors or...dementia he used to paint SnU. Now don't get me wrong, Madoka isn't good because it's a piece of dark fiction, but because its a well-written piece of dark fiction. A lot people get too caught up in its grittiness and play up on how its a revolutionary anime because its DARK AND BROODING. But that's not really the case, it's more like Urobuchi's inherent style melds so well with the genre he's working in. Mahou Shoujo already some entries that take darker approaches to its cliches (the aforementioned Nanoha) and its even got some good deconstructions (Revolutionary Girl Utena and the second half of Princess Tutu). What Madoka does is twisting the guts of the genre only to to pull out every organ slowly and concisely, getting its hands completely bloody in the process while showing the audience the rotted  flesh in its hands. It's plot follows the generic magical girl fight monsters scenario but the actual execution is very different. So much so that it gives off a distinctly different vibe from even the triple A anime in this category. \\n\\n\r\nA good story generally is split up into 3 different Acts, the first is setting the stage, and the third is climax and resolution. The dramatic question comes up in the first act which is pretty much the goal the protagonist must achieve by the third act, and the second is about the protagonist doing what they must to answer the dramatic question. The importance of all that highbrow BS is simply that Madoka has a completely different dramatic question compared to the norm of the genre. In Mahou Shoujo or even Fighting Shounen, the protagonist gets power of some sort of power in the beginning and is asked by the plot whether they can/will defeat/save/restore something of importance. The question posed to Madoka is \"Will you become a Puella Magi (Magical Girl)?\". First things first, we know by definition that if this is the dramatic question, than we know for sure that we won't see Madoka become a Magical Girl half-way through the series or anytime soon for that matter. We know damn well that its going to part of the climax. Dramatic questions usually force the protagonist to be proactive: to change themselves so they are better equipped to tackle the question. Madoka's as you guessed, commands more a reactionary response. This in turn changes the focus to inwards instead of outwards so its fair to say that this is a primarily character-driven anime. Now that's not to say that the plot remains on the backburner for most of show, in contrary it keeps going with or without Madoka driving it. In that regard, both plot and characters are well done, and one isn't really sacrificed for the other. Both work together concisely to drive the experience home. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing Madoka manages to pull off consistently well is the feeling of uncanniness through out the entire show. In good horror/thriller stories, fear is either presented to the audience in three ways: through the \"self\", through \"uncanniness\" and and through the \"other\". Madoka employs all three to startling good effects. The \"self\" aspect really brings out the psychological aspect of the characters, its the parts where they sit down and sort of think aloud to themselves accentuating their thought-process and presenting it to the audience. This happens a lot, and more importantly each character has their own monologue. Its effective because the girls really convey their own fears to the audience and not only that but a lot of that fear is something most of us can relate to. The \"other\" is basically the unknown and things that we cannot understand. For example, all witch scenes and FX that are done by Genkidan Inu Curry. These scenes are very surreal and abstract which is meant to evoke an otherworldly feeling. Or better yet, Kyubey is a very good personification of the \"other\" simply because the audience cannot understand him or his actions with human perceptions and concepts. The final piece is the uncanny, or the feeling that something is slightly off. This is the one horror aspect that is present in Madoka all the time and its there to unsettle the viewer. Its not the direct kind of \"Boo\" horror, but its a more subtle variety which is designed to peeve the audience and to keep them thinking about it long after they've stopped watching. In this anime, there's always something off, and it really adds a lot to the atmosphere. And if I had to pick only one good thing about Madoka, its the atmosphere. Its essentially draped over the viewer like an enormous blanket and can very well become almost suffocating at times. Its something that made Silent Hill 2, and in my opinion also becomes the driving force behind Madoka. Its the one quality that really separates from it from other good anime and pushes it up there with the best of the best. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really incredible and is probably my favorite soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura. The tracks are very beautiful and melodious, and also border on haunting at times. I really cannot describe how important the music is, because it really is the atmosphere at times. If you were to take the soundtrack away from Madoka, it would substantially worsen the final product. It really just draws the audience into itself and the show. While in some other anime the music can be mediocre and even forgettable, over here its absolutely pivotal. The audio design is also great, the right tracks and used at the right moments and are always in sync with the direction or composition of a scene. One thing I'd like to bring attention to is the script which I actually liked a lot. There's not much filler in the dialogue nor are there any meaningless lines. All of it is put to good use which is really pretty rare to see, most anime these days are rarely efficient with the allocation of lines or script writing. Shaft is especially a bit lenient with this quality and most of the dialogue in their anime can be rather gratuitous at times. \\n\\n\r\nHowever if Madoka can be criticized for anything in its presentation, its definitely the animation. The art style itself is good and contrasts heavily with the subject matter, but the animation often leaves something to be desired. While there are some good action scenes and generally the animation fidelity is actually much higher than in other Shaft anime, it's still a bit choppy. There are also a bunch of art errors in every episode (Meduka Meguca anyone?). This does get better as it goes a long, and its apparent that Shaft saved much of the animation budget for later episodes which do look very impressive from an animation stand point (espeically episode 10, GoHands helped out with that one). Hopefully if Shaft ever decides to do a sequel, they'll budget this appropriately and save up all the money, hookers and blow made from the Madoka BD sales. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Madoka is one the best anime to come out in a few years. It's not based off of a manga which is based off of a light/visual novel, it's not a fanservice-ridden sack of crap, its not utterly and completely generic and most importantly its a big breath of fresh air compared to a lot of the anime that have come out recently. If you're not out to hate it the second you start watching, than you should be able to take away a lot of enjoyment from it because like I said in the beginning, it's a hell of a ride. To all the people who have already seen it, I strongly recommend just marathoning the entire series again after a couple months. Because honestly, Madoka will be an entirely different beast when marathoned compared to being watched weekly. The atmosphere practically begs the audience to watch the entire thing in one go and it'll definitely be an experience worth the trouble. For all those who haven't watched it yet, what exactly are you waiting for? More importantly, why are you reading reviews instead of watching this anime? It's a no-brainer, don't make me beg you all to watch it.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica wants be an outstanding show, something that wasn't delivered before, but fails at this feat in pretty much all departments of animation.\r\nIt's commonly conceived as a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre. However Madoka Magica merely twists some aspects of the mahou shoujo genre to give them a dark edge, but does not critically point out any potential flaws of the genre to make its audience question the genre's substance.\r\nStarting off with the most obvious aspect, the visuals, Madoka Magica presents us with a  lot of dark alleys and conversations without much animations going on. The few battles going on duringthe show do provide us with some rather good animations, although the many immersion breaking paper cut-outs are rather forgettable in those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Madoka Magica really wants to be a strong point for the series, often creating a feeling that \"something interesting may happen sometime\" to the audience. The problem is that nothing out of the ordinary actually ever happens. Virtually every single part of the show's story is forseeable, to an extend that a lot of people had actually thought up the show's major plot points much earlier before they had come up during the original airing.\\n\r\nFor an ending that feels like the author was not exactly sure on what it should be like, while not delivering anything new or exciting, Madoka Magica also does not deserve much credit.\\n\\n\r\nHaving spawned dozens of character fan arts, the characters should be the shows strong point, but even here it is lacking substance. Over the course of all 12 episodes, the characters are very hesistant on making decisions and moving on, reducing the show's story to a few stretched out, sometimes very forced key plot elements. Due to this behavior the characters appear very one-dimensional, although the writer's intend on making these characters feel like actual people does shine through occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nTaking all of its flaws in consideration it, I find Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica to be a rather boring show to watch. The action is good and enjoyable, but the characters talking and bitching about the same problems for episodes, and not coming to any interesting conclusions, really wears down on the enjyoment of this anime.",

            "content": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Goethe. Voltaire. William Shakespeare. Charles Dickens. Oscar Wilde. These are some of the most critically acclaimed and influential authors the world has ever seen. They have written texts that have shaped way we perceive the world. They have introduced ideas and philosophies that were previously unimaginable, and as a result left a deep imprint on the Western and Eastern worlds.  But alas, none of them compare to Urobuchi Gen's magnum opus, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Never before was there such a profound piece of art on this level of brilliance. By comparison, all of the other authors mentioned seem like amateur fanfictionwriters. I had a hard time writing that with a straight face, but anyway onto the review.\\n\\n\r\n Madoka Shoujo Madoka Magica is a supposed, \"deconstruction,\" of the magic girl genre. I use the term deconstruction loosely. It gained popularity, or rather notoriety, due its \"deep,\" themes, \"symbolism,\", \"complex\" characters, and of course Urobuchi's trademark cruelty. All of these factors combined should be the recipe for success, correct? Not in this case. Madoka isn't a bad show by any standard. It is a show that reaches for the stars and falls drastically short. \\n\\n\r\nStory(6/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica starts off misleading the viewer into thinking it is just a regular magical girl show. You have a pink haired protagonist with low self-esteem, a blue haired tomboy-esque chick who serves a foil character, and a magical creature that basically grants wishes. This has been the formula for any magical girl anime released in the past decade. However, this is all a facade to mask the fact that Madoka is a relatively dark show. The titular character, Madoka, comes into contact with a strange creature called, QB, who makes her an offer that is hard to refuse. You will be granted one wish, and in return you will become a Magic Girl who has to fight these monstrosities called, \"witches,\" to save the world. Sounds like any young girl from Japan's dream right? However, little does poor Madoka know that their are huge consequences that come with this contract. Very early on in the show, we witness the hardships of being a Mahou Shoujo. Death, loneliness, despair. These are all that await these young girls. Sounds enticing right? Well, the show's execution is flawed and I will explain why.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the show's pacing is off. The viewer is quick introduced to events without sufficient foreshadow or buildup, thus all the plot twists come off as contrived. Madoka would have benefited from being a 24 episode show as opposed to a 12 episode series. Everything comes off as rushed. There is not sufficient world building or anything that makes the show come off as organic in terms of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is an over reliance on plot twists but most of these plot twists are simply just shock value. You thought what happened to Character A was awful in every way? No, that was just the beginning, THIS is much worse. And what lessons do we learn from all this suffering and cruelty? Nothing. There is no greater insight in seeing horrible things happen to these girls aside that Urobuchi's sadistic tendencies manifest themselves in interesting ways. The central theme in Madoka is to, \"be careful what you wish for,\" and it is made obvious the first couple times bad things happen to the characters. But constantly adding new twists every couple of episodes to make the main characters lives increasingly harder becomes borderline ridiculousness. It doesn't help that most of these twists seem to come from thin air aside from a few that were alluded to.\\n\\n\r\nThird, it is advertised as a deconstruction but it is anything but. Madoka may be a dark show but dark does not automatically mean deconstruction. At its core, Madoka is the same as every other Magical girl show out there only more edgier. It does nothing to point out the flaws of the magical girl genre and give us deeper insight into what it truly means to put your life on the line for an empty cause. Side point, the show also has underlying misogynistic themes. If you look closely, QB says that many of the great women in history were magical girls but all failed or messed up in some way or form. Is this to say that women are incapable of handling any sort of real power? Who knows, but that is my take on it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka was animated by Studio SHAFT, a studio best known for their eccentric animation style. Madoka is a beautiful show. The backgrounds are very detailed and are laden with symbolism. The lighting gives Madoka this dark and ominous feel which adds a lot to the immersion. It makes it very hard to take your eyes off of the show. The character designs are a bit off putting to me though. The faces of the characters are square and a bit pudgy. Pretty weird in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)- The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kaijura, famous for her works on The Garden of Sinners and .Hack series. This is probably one of her greatest efforts to date. The soundtrack is composed of melancholic soundscapes with occasional orchestrated high energy tracks that suit the more tense fight scenes. The sound direction for this show is truly impeccable as each track captures every moment appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(4/10)- The character aspect is arguably the show's Achilles Heel. The title character, Madoka, has to be the worst character in the show. She starts off with low self-esteem, leading me to believe there is going to be some interesting character development but surprisingly she never changes. The entire show literally revolves around her and yet she does nothing of interest for most of the show. Madoka is a character defined by her environment, a reactionary character if you will. She cries and moans over the bad things that happens to her and her friends, but we rarely ever get a deeper look into her character.\\n\\n\r\nHer best friend, Miki Sayaka is hardly any better. She starts off as brash and bold, but we slowly get to learn more about her character. However, her backstory isn't fleshed out sufficiently to the point where I feel like she is an actual person. Her wish, although understandable, lacks any substance behind it. What I mean is, there wasn't a sufficient explanation as to why she made this wish aside from, I like this guy. As far as we know, there is no deep history between the characters so the wish comes off as stupid to me. Although she does, develop throughout the show, it hardly makes her likable or a better character. Her character developments seem inorganic because once again, they rely on shock value via plot twists. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters such as Akemi and Kyoko are only slightly better but their motivations and reasons behind most of the things they do, don't make sense within the time frame it occurs. Kyoko goes from hating Sayaka in one episode, so much so that she wants to kill her, and in the very next she is revealing to her a sad sob story about her origins. There was no build up. What made her change her mind so quickly? Yes, she did say Sayaka reminded her of herself, but that isn't an adequate reason to change your mind about someone you were going to kill the episode before. Their \"friendship,\" was rushed to the point of disbelief, and didn't make sense. Akemi is the same way, although her situation is slightly more understandable.   But the extent to which Akemi would sacrifice herself for Madoka didn't make sense because they haven't even known each for a year and barely even a month. It does not make sense. Nobody would go through so much turmoil for someone they just met. And Akemi also has a power that was poorly explained and comes off as a plothole but due to spoilers I will not say what it is.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is QB. I felt as though he was the easiest person to empathize with and his reason for making girls sign the contract was understandable aside from a few gripes I have with his reasoning behind it. But I don't think the show wanted me to empathize with someone they painted as a villain, but I felt he was more realistic than the aforementioned characters.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (6/10)- So in conclusion, is Madoka the masterpiece it was hyped up to be? Not at all. It did not do to the Magical Girl genre what Evangelion did to mecha, and at it is core it is the same as all the other anime in its genre. The comparisons made with it being similar to Faust and European literature are superficial and borderline offensive to the authors. Madoka does not match the quality of most literature so I thought I should just put an end to that notion. The reason I am so harsh towards Madoka is because I look at what it could've been and what it is, and I am deeply saddened it turned out this way. However, Madoka is not completely without merit. It is an interesting take on the magical girl genre, and has some phenomenal production values. I would definitely recommend a watch but don't go in with high expectations because they are bound to be crushed.",

            "content": "\"It sucks, but you can't reach a happy ending just by doing what's right all the time.\" - Kaname Junko\r\nNow, there are already quite a few reviews of this anime out there (and more to come, most likely) but since all of them differ in some way, I might as well write mine too. However, the first thing I\u2019ll tell you is that if you haven\u2019t seen this show (or had it spoiled for you), and you have any intention whatsoever to actually watch it, then my tip would be to actually not read too much about the series before watching it...\r\nNow then, let\u2019s getdown to it... I was very much on the fence (and still am) about some of these scores, and whether they should actually be a 9 or 10, so take it with an additional pinch of salt (and remember, a perfect score does not mean it\u2019s all perfect).\\n\\n\r\nStory: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nIn all its simplicity, Madoka\u2605Magica is a breakdown and reconstruction of the \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d genre, in an attempt to make it more realistic and mature. And to be totally honest, they did a fantastic job with this. \\n\r\nThe buildup, plot twists and all the emotional moments in this series really come together to make it all a wonderful experience. Now, I\u2019m aware (and have been told by several people) that the start of the series is quite slow, but I really think that adds to the whole \u201cpsychological\u201d effect of the anime. This isn\u2019t your standard, fast-paced good vs. evil action series with a dash of romance and comedy (as many \u201cregular\u201d magical girl shows tend to be). No, this series is about following the struggle of a few select girls who can have anything they want, in exchange for everything. \\n\\n\r\nAt first there\u2019ll be a lot of questions raised, many left unanswered until almost the end of the series, but thankfully there don\u2019t really exist any gaping plot holes, nor are any questions really left unanswered in the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nAnimation is done by Shaft, and if you\u2019ve seen any of their other works (Monogatari series, Zetsubou sensei etc) then that should be all you need to know. The art is absolutely amazing, which you\u2019ll see from just the first 10 or so seconds of the opening sequence. Aside from the great quality of the art, I really enjoyed the \u201cclean\u201d aesthetics of the environment/backgrounds, and the use of light colors for many of the characters.  \\n\r\nCharacter design is well done, but nothing overly amazing, tho it certainly distinguish all the characters, and makes them more memorable in a way. As for fan service, well... There is none. I mean, there\u2019s not a single indication of fan service anywhere... at all...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn\u2019t anything to scoff at either. Fluid both during fighting scenes and... well, non-fighting scenes, some good animations really help a lot in the portrayal of characters and their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening/ending scenes, there isn\u2019t all too much I can say. The opening really shines at portraying that \u201cadvertised\u201d feeling of \u201cthis is a happy show about cute girls\u201d that the creators wanted to convey. The ending sequence however, is more or less just a silhouette of the main character walking away to music... \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the musical score first. The opening theme, \u201cConnect\u201d by ClariS, is quite a happy song, and just like its accompanying opening sequence it does a great job of portraying that aforementioned \u201chappy\u201d feeling. Now, previously when I talked about the ending sequence, I was more or less referring only to that in which Kalafina\u2019s \u201cMagia\u201d play, as this is the most \u201cprominent\u201d or well known of the 4 ending songs. The other 3 consist of the opening theme, \u201cConnect\u201d, a rather sad song called \u201cMata Ashita\u201d by Aoi Yuuki, and finally a not so sad, but not really happy song called \u201cAnd I\u2019m home\u201d, by Ai Nonaka and Eri Kitamura. \\n\r\n\u201cMagia\u201d however, receives quite a bit more credit because not only is it played in 7 of the 12 episodes, but it\u2019s also the most outstanding of the songs. Aside from being the ending theme of the series, it\u2019s also used quite frequently during some of the more \u201cepic\u201d moments of the series, such as fighting scenes, and it really helps bring out the feelings of certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of background music, Madoka\u2605Magica features quite an amazing soundtrack. It\u2019s overall pretty varied, ranging from happy themes such as \u201cCredens Justitiam\u201d, to darker songs such as \u201cWalpurgis Nux\u201d, there\u2019s always a song which fits the situation, and really helps in conveying the feelings which want to be conveyed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nMadoka\u2605Magica consists of a rather small cast of characters, but interesting ones nonetheless. The characters all felt very real to me, and the amount of character development in this series is just great. It makes the characters feel even more \u201calive\u201d, and really helps you relate and connect with them. The characters all (mostly) have solid and interesting backstories, however I feel like the reason this part is only a 9, is simply because of the fact that a certain character didn\u2019t have as much backstory or information about her which I felt like she should have (but who knows, maybe that\u2019ll change in the last movie).\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t too much more I can say here, without spoiling anything, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nThis is easily a 10/10 for me. I was lucky enough to not have anything really told to me about this show more than maybe \u201cit\u2019s a bit dark\u201d, or \u201cit\u2019s pretty weird\u201d, so the shock factor and all were quite high for me. All the emotions, and the lingering feelings of this show really makes it an amazing #1 favorite of mine.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nNow, this is obviously not your regular \u201cmahou shoujo\u201d, nor is it intended for the regular audience of said genre, but rather for a more mature audience. If you\u2019re a fan of darker, slightly psychological shows, then I assure you you\u2019re gonna love this if you can ignore the slightly slow beginning.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Amazing plot, with lots of twists and drama.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding soundtrack.\\n\r\n+ Great art (as expected of Shaft).\\n\r\n+ Interesting, fleshed out characters.\\n\r\n+ Lots of heart wrenching / heartwarming moments.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Starts out fairly slow. \\n\r\n- Shock factor of certain parts may decrease if you\u2019ve read too much about the show.",

            "content": "In all honesty, I entered this series with optimistic skepticism, for as a general principle, I tend not to like highly rated anime.  Far too often, I see a story with a great concept that misses several key opportunities to expand the plot [Angel Beats], or perhaps one whose characters simply don't seem particularly real to me [Hanasaku Iroha--at least, the first 4 episodes I watched before subsequently dropping the series].  To say the least, I expected this to be one of the same kinds of anime.\r\nBoy, was I wrong.\r\nMost reading this will know the story.  Reading other reviews will reveal thatthis is an anime that makes one think it will turn out one way, only to violently and, sometimes, unexpectedly switch gears.  Since that has been hashed out so much, I'll skip that and cut straight to the ratings:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nBeginning (15 points):  14\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins fairly simply, introducing the general plotline in the first few episodes.  As the characters are introduced, their personalities are very slowly (sometimes painstakingly so) revealed as to show their hidden motives and interests, which piqued my interest early on.  Curiously, characters' pasts are not well-documented here, unlike in some of the manga and even the PSP game that exists now.  My only criticism of the introduction is that Mami and Madoka, the main focus of this arc, could have benefited from even a few more minutes of delving into their past and/or present lives, but even in omitting that information, the viewer still has plenty of information to understand the characters.  Even still, this is enough of a flaw to deny the beginning a perfect 15.  The beginning was sufficient in explaining the beginning of the character development, and it amazed me in how it very efficiently shifted the plot into the middle of the story and on into the climax--every single scene had a purpose that became crystal clear as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nClimax (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues, throwing plot twist after plot twist at the viewer.  Not only are they true to their name in that many of them are simply unexpected, but they also have amazing cohesion into further developing the characters.  Not only that, in the transition from the beginning to middle, I found the emotion on display during each episode to be so strikingly real, that my emotions matched each character's own feelings with disturbing consistency.  In no other anime has my empathy been that strong and consistent with the characters.  It's common to feel bad for the characters, but it's much more difficult to give a viewer that level of empathy.  As much as I try to think of a flaw for this section, none comes to mind.  As a result, the climax gets a perfect 15.\\n\\n\r\nEnding (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nAt some points, I got a little misty-eyed towards the end of the climax section.  In the end, I was holding back tears through most of it.  The level of emotion easily eclipses that of the climax, making it very hard to keep a straight face, much less outright sobbing (Clannad After Story, anyone?).  At first, I honestly didn't like how the very last episode worked, but as I looked into it through reading other reviews among other things, I realized that I simply didn't understand it, and then it really grew on me.  I then concluded that there was no other ending I would have liked more than that one--for the dark nature of the anime, it really was a perfect ending in that it wasn't your stereotypical \"Happy ending\".  It had a giant asterisk.  What it was, well...you'll have to find out ;)  Combining the emotional appeal of the episodes leading up to the final one as well as the conclusion of the last episode itself, I would have to say that the ending also earns a perfect score.  If you are easily touched by happy or sad scenes, bring a hankie.  You'll need it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Quality and Development (20 points): 19\\n\\n\r\nI'm really trying to find flaws here.  In my opinion, it's damn near impossible.  EVERY character has a 3-dimensional personality, and there wasn't a single main character who didn't seem real, human, and likeable, within reason.  The weakest link of all the characters is really Madoka, but even her personality is realistic.  The ONLY flaw I can think of is the lack of history in two of the five main characters (even the Pokemon reject Kyuubey gets his own development) that I mentioned in the \"Beginning\" section of the story review.  One point lost for lost potential, but other than that, any criticism is really just splitting hairs.\\n\\n\r\nArt (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is pretty good stuff.  As you progress through the story, the witch world art is absolutely surreal--the term I used to describe it after my first night watching was \"Alice in Wonderland-meets-LSD hallucination\".  It was so good, and even haunting, that I had a dream where my surroundings were witch world-esque.  The art was creepy at first, but it  grows on you.  I really liked it.  Perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10 points): 10\\n\\n\r\nReally hard to argue with the sound.  SFX were as creepy as the art.  BGM was probably a little thinner than most, but so many scores stuck with you.  Stuff I hadn't heard in a week, I still remembered.  The rest made it on my iPod.  Really hard to criticize a soundtrack that you're listening to in your spare time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10 points): 10\\n\\n\r\nI never thought I'd watch an anime that I would like better than Clannad.  Till now.  Though it's close, this has to be my new favorite anime, and I doubt that will change anytime soon.  I spent several rewatches staying up until the wee hours of the morning simply because I couldn't put the series down long enough to go to sleep.  With that kind of obsession with Madoka Magica, I can't give it anything other than a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTally that up, and the final score for the series is a whopping 98/100, good enough for an easy MAL score of 10.  Outrageous as it sounds, I've never had an anime that made me laugh, cry, and spend sleepless nights awake in a mixture of shock and horror as much as this one.  I truly enjoyed it fully, and if Kyuubey were real, I'd contract with him to let me watch this over and over again for the first time every time.",

The story keeps you yearning for that next episode. As of episode 9 it hasn't lost steam.\r\nThis is an adult-targeted magical girl show. It's dark, heavy-hitting, suspenseful and the battles with witches are glorious and ridiculous. I'd go so far as to call it Magical Girlin' Lagann.

            "content": "Madoka Magica is a story of Hope, Friendship, Despair, Evil Fluffy Magical Creatures, Cotton Balls with Moustaches and Parasailing Men in Orange Jumpsuits.It's also the best damn anime Japan has put out in a rather long time.\r\nI hes\u00adit\u00adate to use the word \u2018sub\u00adver\u00adsion\u2019 when describ\u00ading Madoka Magica, as it\u2019s a word thrown around by many, not under\u00adstand\u00ading what it is Madoka is sub\u00advert\u00ading in the first place. What I see is a group of girls, who oth\u00ader\u00adwise would spend their time eat\u00ading cake, being cute and gen\u00ader\u00adally being insuf\u00adfer\u00adably nice to each other, hav\u00ading great powers given to them and then made to suf\u00adfer becauseof it. This power is that of hav\u00ading their wish gran\u00adted in exchange for being a magical girl, some\u00adthing other magical girl anime, and anime stor\u00adies in gen\u00aderal, paint as being a glor\u00adi\u00adous thing. How\u00adever in Madoka Magica, this wish and power bring each char\u00adac\u00adter noth\u00ading but des\u00adpair. Not only do their lives effect\u00adively end because they became magical girls and suf\u00adfer in the gruelling battles against the witches, their wishes that are meant to be an equi\u00adval\u00adent trade off bring them noth\u00ading but more mis\u00adfor\u00adtune as well.\\n\\n\r\nSub\u00adver\u00adsion or not, the main appeal of Madoka Magica is what a per\u00adfectly told story it is. There\u2019s a very delib\u00ader\u00adate and clear path behind each character\u2019s devel\u00adop\u00adment. I found Kaname Madoka\u2019s devel\u00adop\u00adment the most fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading, espe\u00adcially in con\u00adtrast with what she could have been. Because of her own wimp\u00adi\u00adness and not becom\u00ading a magical girl, she keeps draw\u00ading more and more into her\u00adself, get\u00adting increas\u00adingly depressed with everything that hap\u00adpens to the girls around her. Shaft\u2019s anim\u00ada\u00adtion, often one that is more gimicky than use\u00adful, add hugely to the story-telling here. The altern\u00adate dimen\u00adsions of the witches are fright\u00aden\u00ading and bizarre places. The back\u00adgrounds have become increas\u00adingly dreary as the series goes on, mim\u00adick\u00ading the change in tone and depres\u00adsion of Madoka. Also spe\u00adcial credit has to be given for the way they frame Kyubey.\\n\\n\r\nKyubey is mag\u00adni\u00adfi\u00adcent. In a show with a cast of rather for\u00adget\u00adtable char\u00adac\u00adters, if mem\u00ador\u00adable stor\u00adies, Kyubey stands out as the most fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading and deadly vil\u00adlain since Johan Liebert of Mon\u00adster. Again, full credit has to be given to Shaft\u2019s art\u00adwork and how they frame Kyubey. How his shad\u00adows cast over the girls, stand\u00ading on their shoulders or their win\u00addowsills, push\u00ading Madoka into becom\u00ading a magical girl her\u00adself. How they fre\u00adquently draw atten\u00adtion to his unmov\u00ading expres\u00adsion, one that doesn\u2019t change no mat\u00adter what latest cata\u00adstrophe these girls he per\u00adson\u00adally made magical girls face.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes him so chilling is how he simply doesn\u2019t under\u00adstand. What we and the char\u00adac\u00adters see as evil is at a level he can\u00adnot com\u00adpre\u00adhend. Kyubey isn\u2019t evil, and never was, which is pre\u00adcisely why he works so well. Pos\u00adsibly the best line in the anime came in his con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion with Madoka and why he made them magical girls, say\u00ading \u201cif you feel like sac\u00adri\u00adfi\u00adcing your\u00adself for the uni\u00adverse, give me a call\u201d. The heat death of the uni\u00adverse is so far bey\u00adond any\u00adthing Madoka her\u00adself can com\u00adpre\u00adhend or care about, entropy not hav\u00ading any effect for a bizz\u00adlion odd years, but equally Kyubey can\u2019t under\u00adstand why his actions cause the girls to hate him so much.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some prob\u00adlems with Madoka Magica though. Well, one spe\u00adcific prob\u00adlem. The char\u00adac\u00adters are dull. Their stor\u00adies are fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading, cer\u00adtainly. I\u2019ve got\u00adten pretty emo\u00adtion\u00adally inves\u00adted in the wimpy\u00adness of Madoka and Homerun-chan the time trav\u00adel\u00adling les\u00adbian, but as people they simply don\u2019t have much per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adity. Without Kyubey, this would just be yet another anime about a bunch of incred\u00adibly dull girls being insuf\u00adfer\u00adably nice to each other, except with some occa\u00adsion\u00adally nice visu\u00adals. Well, not all nice visu\u00adals. I\u2019m rather par\u00adtial to the square-head design of the char\u00adac\u00adters, but their facial fea\u00adtures go rather array when the shot of it is any\u00adthing other than a close-up.\\n\\n\r\nOver\u00adall though, Madoka Magica is pretty fant\u00adastic anime. It\u2019s per\u00adfectly con\u00adstruc\u00adted and very delib\u00ader\u00adately paced, keep\u00ading enough rev\u00adel\u00ada\u00adtions with each epis\u00adode to keep it riv\u00adet\u00ading while keep\u00ading to the themes of the story without des\u00adcend\u00ading into shock tac\u00adtics for the sake of keep\u00ading out interest. They had to keep the twists com\u00ading, oth\u00ader\u00adwise the story would flounder when stuck with these bor\u00ading char\u00adac\u00adters, but it hasn\u2019t done that once over the course of the show. Well, per\u00adhaps bar the first two epis\u00adodes, but the speed at which it upped the ante after set\u00adting the scene means I\u2019m will\u00ading to for\u00adgive the show for that.Heck, they even somehow managed to piece together an acceptable ending that fit the plot and themes of the story, something I really was not expecting.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Madoka Magica is a bloody fantastic anime. It's not perfect, but damn is it ever entertaining. Highly recommended, perhaps not for a first-timer to the world of anime, but certainly for one who thinks anime hasn't been able to buy an original idea for years.\\n",

            "content": "You know, I really can't stand it when an anime gets a lot of hype. Not only is most of the hype unnecessary and coming from crazed otaku's, but half the time that leads me to having high expectations and I'm almost always let down. Not to mention overhyped anime is usually the type to attract the harshest of critics and haters, ready to bash on it. So when I first started \"Madoka Magica,\" I was pretty much ready to be annoyed by the so-called \"dark themes\" and went into it with the idea that it was just another anime that can appeal to everyone.\r\nLet'sjust say that it deconstructed that whole idea just as well as it did the magical girl genre. \\n\\n\r\nBy now you probably know that \"Madoka Magica\" starts off just as any other magical girl anime, but then twists into something darker. You should know that the plot of this anime is a very complex thing and does indeed steer off into a darker corner then most magical girl animes. While \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the first mahou shoujo to have dark themes in it, it's shocking twists and turns are what make it so popular and praised, and it deserves a lot of it. The story's true nature is written out and presented in ways that can captivate you. It takes things you thought were true, characters you thought you knew, and is able to change them right before your eyes into something that fits the story's underlying dark side. \\n\\n\r\nSo \"Madoka Magica\" has a deeply rooted story with lots of sick changes to it's genre and therefore it's story is perfect. Well no. Actually one of the biggest faults in the story is the use of these twists and turns themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTwo words. Shock value. When a viewer sees something shocking, they'll probably start thinking, \"Wow! This got so cool!\" and the shock value therefore makes the story seem better. \"Madoka Magica\" is guilty of doing this a number of times. It's an easy thing that some viewers may catch onto quickly and could lower your overall viewpoint of the show. \"If the story didn't shock you so much, would it still be good?\" That's a question that \"Madoka Magica\" brings up, and the answer varies on your own ideas and opinions of it's plot, which I personally think would still be worth it's praise even if we knew from the start it would be a dark mahou shoujo. However it's still worth noting that the shock value, for the most part, has a purpose that helps keep the plot moving forward instead of just being there to keep you interested in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the plot moves forward VERY fast. With 12 episodes, the show is paced at a very high speed. The story basically takes you and dives you at top speed into everything, which is exactly why you don't even need the shock value to keep you wanting more. Things happen quickly which will probably excite you and make you want to keep going. Overall, the story is a much darker and deeper tale for it's genre, and is able to make up (but not cover up) its flaws with everything that it leads into and presents. \\n\\n\r\nThe fast pacing leads into one big problem though, and that's with the characters. The characters more or less fill in typical stereotypes to further the deconstruction of magical girls, but with the show moving at such a high speed aren't given much time for proper development - and in some cases not enough time to grow attached to you - which leads to some of them looking a bit flat. The lack of development in Madoka, our main girl, is one of the more irritating things that can easily get to you as the show progresses. Most of the development was used on the story, mind you - so in return for less character development we get a higher quality story. Despite all of this, the fact that these character types are thrown into this type of situation makes them and their actions far more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the fast pacing, the characters may change a bit too quickly for one's liking, but in the end their changes reflect the very thing that triggered it all very nicely. Basically, the development that does occur matches the girl's current state in this deconstruction which is a plus. All the girls are capable of being likeable (Stereotypes? Likeable!? Yes, it is possible.) which is another high point of the series, it just all depends on your own preferences. In total, the characters were portrayed and played out very well, but sadly lacked in a few things because of the 12 episode time frame.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the artwork; if you're familiar with the studio SHAFT, masterminds behind the animation in titles like \"Bakemonogatari\" and \"ef - a tale of memories\" then you probably know what to expect from the artwork. While the character designs are given a very cute, typical, moe look, it's the backgrounds and animation that bring up the score to a 10. The setting is one that matches a futuristic background, and the details used to bring this out are outstanding. The quality is extremely high, nearly meeting that of a movie's. The witch's labyrinth's gives off an ominous feeling - equal to the show's true nature as well and have such a unique design to them that can leave you staring in wonder. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to the art is the very \"cute\" designs given to the characters, not to mention since it seems SHAFT put their all into the fight scenes, witch's lairs, etc. the characters sometimes look disproportional or even unfitting in a scene. But hey, that was the goal, right? Remember; deconstruction. Still, everything else that this top-notch animation does right makes up for it without a doubt. Simply put - while character designs are a bit lackluster, everything else around them is animated and designed at such a high quality that it's natural to be left awestruck.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is done by Yuki Kajiura, and is like the artwork and animation - top-notch. The OST has some extremely memorable and emotional songs that are bound to grow attached to you. Kajiura's style matches perfectly with this anime's style, which just makes the soundtrack even more amazing. It's pretty diverse and I highly doubt you'll be able to forget about it, even if you end up hating this anime. The blend or orchestral sounds, chimes, all of it is done with such great, notable effort. \\n\\n\r\nAll the seiyuus fit their roles very well. As for dub/sub, I don't recommend the dub at all. While I'm not a dub bashed, it's simply not good and the voice actors just aren't able to match the characters nor live up to the original Japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Honestly, I didn't think I would enjoy this all that much. Like I said, series that are hyped up with deep stories usually come off flat to me. Not this show, though. No, \"Madoka Magica\" is not a complete masterpiece, nor is it flawless or the best thing you'll ever lay your eyes on. It had flaws just like any anime will, but these flaws are things that can be overlooked if you're able to see the positives and enjoy what \"Madoka Magica\" has to offer you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the most perfect anime ever and isn't something that everyone can watch and like, and for good reasons, too. But despite this, it's still possible for anyone to still enjoy and love this distorted take on the mahou shoujo genre for all the positives that it has to offer, just as long as you accept it's flaws, too. I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mahou shoujo, action, the ever-famous horror genre, and who's ready to take off on the twisted and more mingled road of magical girls. \\n\\n\r\nOverhyped? Yes, but with all the wonderful things that this show has to offer, I can understand why. Try it - it's one hell of a ride on the sinister side of mahou shoujo.",

            "content": "Of all the divisive figures in anime, very few can start flame wars like Gen Urobuchi. Most \"elite\" critics here on MAL and over on the bastion of sophisticated intellectuals that is 4chan, hate him and call him the Anti-Christ of anime. I personally find him extremely hit-or-miss. One thing Urobuchi has going for him is that like George RR Martin, he is a crusty old bastard that won't cave to fan demands and make a happy ending, sparing all of the fan favorite characters. When the viewer doesn't know who will live and who will die each week, it adds suspense and keeps thingsfrom getting boring and predictable. He also IS actually a competent writer that can create beloved characters and keep a steady tone with occasional bouts of witty and sophisticated dialogue. \"I have long since learned, as a measure of elementary hygiene, to be on guard when anyone quotes Pascal.\" The Achilles heel of Urobuchi is that the man doesn't have a creative bone in his body. ALL he does is rip off other authors, and he barely even tries to disguise it. Sometimes he doesn't even disguise it and explicitly mentions it, like Psycho Pass with the works of Philip K. Dick, notably Minority Report, a copy of which appears prominently in the background of one episode on a bookshelf! This generally means that the quality of the Urobuchi anime is directly dependent on what he is ripping off and if that work lends itself to easy adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSo if Aldnoah Zero is a shitty Gundam ripoff and Psycho Pass is a surprisingly great adaptation of Philip K Dick's Minority Report, what is Madoka Magica ripping off? Mostly NGE actually. \"WHAT!? Those 2 series are nothing alike! This reviewer must be on crack!\" Allow me to explain what I mean. In the second half of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Anno decided to make it more of a psychoanalysis project, but during the first half, EVA was supposed to serve as a complete deconstruction of the \"teens pilot giant robots\" Mecha genre. A \"deconstruction\" , at least the way the term is used in conversation online, is when you break down a genre by identifying all the cheesy tropes and cliches, and turn them all around into something new. More often than not, this creates a dark new twist on the genre that basically shows what would happen if that genre happened in real life. For example, during the Gold and Silver Ages of American comics, costumed heroes received immense powers and never let that power corrupt them or isolate them from the rest of humanity. They fought crime without wanting anything in return, delivered cheesy one liners, and helped citizens basically all day out of the goodness of their hearts. This of course sounds completely bullshit and totally opposite of the dark reality that we all know and live in. In response, Alan Moore decided to create Watchmen to absolutely demolish American costume hero comics and show what would actually happen. The government uses super heroes to win wars by slaughtering millions of people, heroes develop God complexes, or are greedy, or are violent sociopaths. All of the cliches are turned upside down and all the bullshit assumptions of the genre were shattered. Neon Genesis Evangelion initially wished to do the same thing to the mecha genre and show why emotionally fragile teenagers suffering the angst that all teenagers naturally feel, would actually be HORRIBLE candidates to pilot giant robots and save the world from monsters. Madoka tries to be complete deconstruction of the \"magical girl\" genre of anime, which if that sounds like a stupid idea, it's because it honestly kind of is.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: Some Spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nSo what does a genre deconstruction of \"magical girl\" anime look like? Exactly what you think it would look like. Little moe girls receive magical powers, but this time those powers always come at a tragic cost and everything is extremely grim and depressing. I won't spoil too much of the plot, but basically magical girls have to give up their souls in order to get their powers and spend their days fighting monsters that they will eventually turn into once they become too tainted. \u201cBeware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\u201d-Nietzsche in his book \"Beyond Good and Evil\". \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this WOULD have been a decent idea, if EVERYONE hadn't already done it before! Claymore did this back in the early 2000s! Berserk has dealt with this topic. Hellsing has dealt with this topic. Not only has everyone done it, but a LOT have done it better than Madoka did! As for the whole \"brilliant deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre, the freaking magical girl genre has ALWAYS been firmly tongue in cheek, so making a Sailor Moon version of Watchmen wasn't really warranted, it wasn't clever, it doesn't deserve heaps of praise! This anime is quite decent on a technical level with animation, voice acting, music, but I feel it is an insanely overrated series that didn't really even need to exist! EVERYTHING that this anime does and receives praise for, has already been done FAR better by loads of other series. Madoka isn't actually a bad anime, but it is NOT a freaking masterpiece that needs an 8.6 out of 10. If Watchmen in terms of quality as a groundbreaking deconstruction is on the 100th floor and Eva is on the 80th floor, Madoka Magica is somewhere around sub-basement 3. Madoka is basically a mediocre anime that receives absurd amounts of praise from noobs, who have no idea what a genre deconstruction is and think Madoka is groundbreaking and brilliant, when it actually isn't. In summary, FUCK this series! Although I DO love the pun that people keep shouting online: Rusev Madoka, Rusev Magica! It is rather rare to see Bulgarian/Japanese language puns. I guess if I had to pick the most positive thing Madoka contributed, it would be that.",

            "content": "What does it take for a series to become a masterpiece? Take a look at Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, and you might find the answer to that question.\r\nI'll start this review by pointing out that I was not expecting much from this show. I didn't really want to watch it, either. The Mahou Shoujo genre has never interested me, so when a friend of mine, who in the past suggested things like Mirai Nikki, Deadman Wonderland, Death Note and Psycho-Pass to me, told me to watch Madoka Magica, I thought he was kidding and I ignored the series for a while. Once a month hadpassed, my friend insisted, and I ended up watching the first episode with my sister.\\n\\n\r\nThrowing all my prejucide aside, I sat quietly and watched the first episode. I found it oddly entertaining, so I proceeded to watch the 2nd episode, and then the 3rd. After the 3rd episode ended, I was completely hooked. And by the end of the 12th episode (or the last episode, if you prefer), I was blown away. Gen Urobuchi had done it again.\\n\\n\r\n[Story] \\n\r\n\t\u2013  \u201cMake a contract with me, and become a magical girl!\u201d\\n\r\nThe main character, Kaname Madoka, is a normal 8th grader. Albeit very shy, she is happy, and her family and friends love her exactly the way she is. However, her life takes a dramatic turn when, on a trip to the mall, she rescues Kyuubei, a cat-like being that was being chased by a mysterious black-haired girl. Kyuubei, as a reward, offers Madoka and Sayaka (one of Madoka's friends) a unique deal: he'd make any of their wishes come true, and in exchange,  they would become Magical Girls. And that is how Madoka, and the viewers, are introduced to a world of magic and witches.\\n\\n\r\nNot much else can be said about the story without spoiling anything. However, I have to point that this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, and it's target audience is NOT little girls. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a very dark anime, please keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot begins to unveil is simply magnificent. The build-up of tension, the plot twists, the drama, the (really heavy) psychological atmosphere-- all contribute to create a story that will keep you on your toes at all times.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\n\t \u2013 \u201cIf someone says it\u2019s wrong to hope, I will tell them that they\u2019re wrong every time. I could tell them that countless times!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has a pretty small cast of characters. Because of this, each relevant character grows and changes throughout the series in ways you wouldn't expect. We get to know a lot about the past of some characters, the reasons behind their actions, their feelings, amongst other things, and that makes each character feel unique-- they don't follow any usual patterns.\\n\\n\r\n[Art & Sound]\\n\r\n \t \u2013 \"Is she some kind of anime character or something?\"\\n\\n\r\nAs usual with Shaft (Bakemonogatari, Maria Holic, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei), Madoka Magica has a very original/weird style of animation. The design of the characters is rather simple and features very light colors. However, the animations are good and fluid, specially during action scenes (more on that in a bit). Buildings, on the other hand, are very futuristic and look pretty cool. The use of glass and fluid decorations makes me think of a very peaceful futuristic world. Nature, on the other hand, doesn't stick out of the norm, but the mixture of green + the futuristic monochromatic buildings is a very neat contrast.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this wouldn't be one of Shaft's best works if they didn't add their \u201ctouch\u201d.  When Kaname Madoka and her friends enter the realm of the witches, one of the coolest styles of animation I have seen in anime to this day steals the spotlight. It's very hard to explain, since it varies from witch to witch, but it's definitly intriguing. And of course, Shaft's signature: weird cam angles during dramatic scenes. Both of these add to the overall chaotic feel of the series, so I have to applaud their use.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica's opening is \u201cConnect\u201d, by ClariS. Although it's nothing out of this world, I feel that it fits the \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d theme perfectly. The show has 4 different ending songs, but \u201cMagia\u201d, by Kalafina, is regarded as the \u201creal\u201d ending, since it plays in the most episodes, and denotes the dark nature of the anime. As for the background music, everything fits right into the scenes; whether it's to add intensity to fights or dramatic moments, the music helps and doesn't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\\n\r\n\t \u2013 \u201cWith kindness comes na\u00efvet\u00e9. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be a magical girl.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has got to be the best anime I have ever watched. The way the producers trick the viewers into thinking that this anime is just another Mahou Shoujo is simply brilliant. The characters are interesting, the art managed to catch my attention, and the music is good, but this series' biggest selling point is definitly the plot. Plot twists, drama, heartbreaking AND heartwarming moments... all of these converge into a brilliant plot with a really good ending.\\n\\n\r\nPS: Do not judge a book by its cover!\\n\\n\r\n[Final score: 10/10]",

            "content": "It's been a long while since I watched and completed a magical girl series. So when I first read about SHAFT's first original anime production entitled \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" I was a bit skeptical at first, seeing how I usually don't watched the genre but at the same time curious on how SHAFT and Shinbou Akiyuki will gonna make one with their very unique visual style that defines SHAFT animated works. After watching their previous magical and supernatural series like Bakemonogatari, Dance in The Vampire Bund, Negima, and Natsu no Arashi, I'm convinced that I should at least try the series. \r\nIt\u2019s a magicalgirl series by definition that for quite some time I\u2019ve been avoiding because frilly clothes and magic wands is not something a young adult should be watching or so I believe. But after completing it, I felt fortunate and privileged that I tried it, rarely is a series that can be considered a game-changer, at least in my viewing experience as it convinced me that the magical girl genre can still be enjoyed by young adults like me. The end result is that I\u2019m willing to watch more of this kind of animated works from the past and future.  \\n\\n\r\nIt all begun with a strange dream followed by the introduction of the main character and the world she lives in. Then it was the usual setup in most anime, a new transfer student in the class that will call the attention of the main heroine, followed by a setup that will lead her to a world that she never dreamt existing \u2013 the world of magical girls and witches. The subsequent episodes will document the heroine\u2019s journey meeting people, experiencing different events, journeying bizarre worlds, discovering the truth of the magical girl system and its purpose \u2013 all that will cultivate the one wish she will want granted.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is introduced into the audience in a well planned and carefully executed series of events that will reveal important elements of the plot to move the story forward. Every time it is done, it leads the viewers in the edge of their sit as they ponder what exactly is going on. New characters are eventually introduced along the way, each has an important role; their back story examined and will have their very own moments in the series. The pacing is excellent, never a dull moment in here as each episode is packed with excitement and the right amount of details to keep the viewers looking forward the next episode. It doesn\u2019t help that some episodes ended in a cliffhanger, which lead the viewers particularly me dying from wanting to watch the next episode immediately and hope that it is already the next week. The series ended with a satisfying conclusion; it feels complete but still leaves the viewers wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing SHAFT\u2019s notorious past regarding their animation works, in Madoka Magica there is a welcome change, no longer is the \u201cNO-ANIMATION\u201d as very evident in Bakemonogatari episode 10  will be seen in here, or the character only animation and simple colored background as seen in Hidamari Sketch. For this particular series, SHAFT has produced a world that is engaging with a futuristic approach in their architectural designs from the very spacious, technologically sophisticated, modern design of the main character\u2019s house and the school where she study completely devoid of tight physical space. The background animation is superb, very detailed and probably rivals their other previous best background works in Bakemonogatari (provided there is an actual animation, not the random flashing wallpaper text thing). The color tones are dark and sometimes movie quality indicating how SHAFT probably gave everything they got to animate this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe modern architectural structures some of which are based on real life building designs used to create the cityscape of Mitakihara are very imaginative. The witch\u2019s realm showcases a different kind of creativity in background designs, each realms are carefully designed to evoke emotions from the viewers. \u201cBizarre and surreal\u201d are the proper terms in describing those otherworldly places which offers a hint of the witch\u2019s past before being consumed by despair. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I like Aoki Ume\u2019s \u201cwide face\u201d designs which gave the characters these \u201cnice and cute\u201d facial features, at the same time able to evoke such powerful expressions e.g. when the characters are sad, happy, annoyed, or worried, the wide face design allows the viewers to clearly see those expressions making it possible for them to relate and feel attached to the characters. The character designs used for the witches is a different matter, some look cute and very stylish (e.g. Witch Charlotte), some looked terrible and will give this unsettling feeling of being too real compare to its surroundings (e.g. Witch Gertrud), while some simply look too ugly and has a design that probably only a mother can love (e.g. Witch Oktavia von Seckendorff). \\n\\n\r\nThe transformation sequence are something to look forward also, Tomoe Mami\u2019s transformation sequences are probably the most impressive transformation sequences I have seen to date, thanks mostly to the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies it. The transformation sequence from the other magical girls is all unique looking but not as equally impressive as the one above. The fight animation is also something worth mentioning about since the animators doesn\u2019t cut corners on this one; the fighting scenes are very good and pleasing to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, while I say a lot of very good things about the animation, it comes with minor flaws, one is about the character faces specifically the animation of the eyes appearing a bit off or distorted in distant camera shots and the animation in general is not very smooth for motion. There are also some production errors that are worth noting. Overall, despite the noticeable changes in the animation of Madoka Magica, the series still retains many characteristics that define the unique visual style done by SHAFT like the head tilts, close facial shots, and creative camera angles among others.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one of the highlights of Madoka Magica. The OP theme \u201cConnect\u201d by ClariS is very catchy and pleasant to the ears, makes you want to become a magical girl and currently one of my favorite OPs. The ED theme \u201cMagia\u201d by Kalafina, meanwhile has this very eerie feel on it which is very good in expressing the dark undertones of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks created by the much famed \u201cKaijura Yuki\u201d (which is also the behind the awesome soundtracks of Kara no Kyoukai, Gundam SEED/SEED Destiny, and Tsubasa Chronicle) confirmed that feelings I have, that when you listened to it, the music simply gets into you and all you can think about are magical girls, frilly costumes, and awesome transformation sequences. All the soundtracks are so memorable that I can immediately associate those to the events in the series where it is used as the background theme. My personal favorites in vol.1 and vol.2 are the \u201cSis Puella Magica!\u201d (You Should Be a Magical Girl!) from the scene where Madoka finally said her wish, \u201cDecretum\u201d (Decision) Sayaka\u2019s main theme, and \u201cCredens Justitiam\u201d (Believing in Justice) which is played during Mami\u2019s transformation sequences. Equally impressive though are the soundtracks in vol.3 that are present in the final two episode of the series, the \u201cSurgam Identidem\u201d (I Shall Always Rise) during the battle of the hour, and the \u201cSagitta Luminis\u201d (Arrow of Light) which can also be called the Goddess soundtrack, it is a very heartwarming theme created specifically for the events in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nFeaturing the voices of Yuuki Aoi as the heroine Kaname Madoka, with Saitou Chiwa, Mizuhashi Kaori, Kitamura Eri, and Katou Emiri as support characters, the voices behind the characters in Madoka Magica is an all-star cast that made the overall viewing experience much fun just listening to everyone speaking. \\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica has a small amount of characters, mostly girls that are very cute in my opinion. Kaname Madoka, the heroine of the series is very convincing as a female lead, her struggles that results from the events leading up to her finally saying her wish as well as the measures that she used to counter it are very well portrayed. The other main character that is really well portrayed is Akemi Homura, just like Madoka, her descent to what she have become up to the very end is very well told, her actions justified. Tomoe Mami\u2019s appearance is short but has a very lasting appeal, I always remember her as the \u201cWhat a Magical Girl should be\u201d, her performance, confidence, and graceful movements especially in her fights are very elegant to watch. Then, there is Miki Sayaka, whose story is just sad to watch. The other main character that is introduce late in the series is Sakura Kyouko, initially I hate her character only seeing her as a jerk and a warmonger, but as the episode progress and her past eventually revealed, I believe her actions are justified and I eventually liked her character. Lastly amongst the main characters, I\u2019ll talk about Kyuubey, as a familiar, he is like no other, his performance as the acting villain is really a very wild ride, his words are very evil at the same time not really evil, and his trickery into convincing the girls to make a contract with him makes you want to curse him and shot him with weapons till his body broke into smithereens deserves a high praise and probably an award for doing so. In the end, when all is said and done, especially when he explain the purpose of his existence, I eventually seen him in a good light.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters which represents the rest of the cast like Madoka\u2019s parents, brother, teacher, as well as Sayaka\u2019s love interest and rival also added very important contributions that leads to the development of the main characters. Worth noting is Madoka\u2019s mother Kaname Junko, her conversations and closeness to Madoka as mother-and-daughter is very touching and very refreshing to watch. Also is Shizuki Hitomi, as she did an important role in the middle part of the story. The Witches, while having no real character, with the only hints given about them concerning their past is the design of their realm also added a different form of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is one of the most outstanding series I have seen in recent times. Rarely is a series that has its contents in the form of story, visuals, music, and characterization that are all equally impressive that results in me enjoying the series so much. Even more impressive is the fact that Madoka Magica is a \u201cmagical girl genre,\u201d something I already avoided years ago thinking that there is nothing about the genre that will interest me anymore. After all, the notion about the genre is that it\u2019s \u201ctoo girly\u201d and a \u201ckid\u2019s show\u201d, this series proves that it is not, that it can touch audiences outside its main target audience. It also assures that the genre is something I will be looking forward with enthusiasm and eagerness. Appropriate also to say is that Madoka Magica is the kind of series that appears once every few years that really hit the right marks, the things that makes an anime very great. \\n\\n\r\nAs for my final note, I would recommend this series for viewers who like anime in general. Most recommended to individuals who like a magical girl theme anime that is geared towards the more mature young audiences as the series contains drama and dark themes that is not really very unusual to the genre, it\u2019s just that the series used it correctly, and intricacies that could either make the viewers like or dislike the series.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Updated, added additional impressions after completing BD release",

            "content": "I am the juice of my acid.\r\nSHAFT is my body, and drugs are my blood.\r\nI have created over a thousand seizures.\r\nUnknown to DVD sales.\r\nNor known to stream on time.\r\nHave withstood food to create many anime.\r\nYet, those hands will never hold money.\r\nSo as I pray, \u201cUNLIMITED SHAFT WORKS\u201d\r\n-a rewrite inspired by those thousand freaking awesome muskets shooting at moustachioed dandelions during the end sequence of the first episode.\r\nYou have just stumbled upon the ultimate Mahou Shoujo, one that doesn't care if it's morally ambiguous or not, one with no stock footage, and one where the magic used substitutes candy for bloodbaths.\r\nStory: Magical Girl overtones combined withthe trance-like aesthetics of SHAFT and the glorious character designs by a small green man who lives on top of an all-girls Japanese high schools dormitory (see Hidamari Sketch). The script is written by Urobuchi Gen, known for his work on Fate/Zero (hence the poem) and the highly-acclaimed (and crazy good) visual novel Saya no Uta. He's also noted for making me rub out to a pile of sludge. I really like Mr. Urobuchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a dark Mahou Shoujo. Not like Nanoha at all. Nanoha had some seinen elements in it, but Madoka is a seinen. It takes all the elements of Mahou Shoujo, chucks them in the trash, and completely rewrites the genre. I should note that I have watched a fair amount of anime tagged Horror here on MAL, and not a single one has actually instilled fear in me like Madoka has. This is the only Mahou Shoujo I have come across that actually covers events like suicide, murder, and death in a serious manner and keeps them believable. There is a heavy amount of psychological elements in this anime, too, I should warn. In congruence, I want to laud how the characters mental states and characterization pushes the plot forward unlike many productions. The psychological aspect is so crucial to the story, that without it, the story would be nonexistent. \\n\\n\r\nA slight digression on becoming a magical girl: (minimal spoilers)\\n\r\nEven after a couple of episodes Madoka does not become a Mahou Shoujo. I've heard a lot of complaints that \"she isn't even a magical girl yet, this is stupid\" etc. If you're part of this group, please enlighten yourself with this knowledge; Madoka takes a spin on many magical girl aspects. Thus, gaining magical powers, which usually occurs in the first or second episodes of most magical girl series is an event that is pushed farther off in Madoka. Don't get me wrong, the anime doesn't just do this to be nonconformist. Madoka utilizes the obtainment of power as a driving part of the story and character development. What Madoka factors into it's execution that other magical girl anime don't is the risk of death, and how gaining powers makes you even more susceptible to it. That is why I believe the anime didn't just give the girls powers very early in the series, and I hope this short blurb clears up this little misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: SHAFT WAS HERE (insert every other company name here) IS A LOSER\\n\\n\r\nThe dreamscapes in this anime are stupendous and the frightening nightmarish worlds that appear are undeniably scary. The expansive frontier that the cast is thrown into really delivers the sense of isolation that I believe the staff wanted to present. As for the normal world, SHAFT works it's magic on the buildings and rooms - applying an almost futuristic setting while still within the boundaries of reason. The skyline shots and the pans over wide areas are notably beautiful and quite reminiscent of Ef - a tale of memories (another SHAFT work). There has been some complaint about the character designs, but I would say that they're used in this anime the same way Higurashi used theirs. With the lure of a peaceful and happy scenario, fleshed out with a goofy looking set of characters, the anime seems so innocent. That is until you watch a little of it. Don't create a predisposition on this anime by it's naive appearance, this is one scary anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to praise the transformation scenes. They are never extensively erotic, as that aspect tends to be abused in anime such as Moetan or Nurse Witch Komugi, and they are always different. The second time a transformation scene happened I double took the scene and watched it again to make sure that my eyes weren't deceiving me (so I guess I ended up watching the animation twice anyways, but regardless). That's right, a magical girl transformation sequence that is different every time and isn't overused to consume air time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is like this fabulously intense orchestration that just makes you feel LARGE. The opening animation accompanying the sound definitely contributes to the song and I find it very fitting. One thing to note about the OP is that there's a larger portion of crying than there is of laughter, which should be hint enough to prepare you for an experience that doesn't want to make friends. The ending preformed by Kalafina (Kara no Kyoukai, Sora no Woto) is eargasmic. It has a brutal and rough distorted sound, and isn't full shown until the ending of the third episode. It's stark contrast with the opening really works. The animation set to the ending is a bit spooky if anything, and the hard angry vocals of Kalafina make it all the more intense. The sound track throws in some \"acid music\" (there's not a word for what SHAFT has done here) so just watch out for that music. Word on the street is that side effects include chronic arousal and aviator application. I can personally vouch though, that the soundtrack is varied and creative, and that it's hard to remove your sick shades for more than a few seconds while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Madoka Kaname is the average personality-less protagonist who is best described (by herself) as \"kinda dumb\" and \"has no special skills.\" She leads an average life with a loving family. Her friends are a tomboy and aradere that at first prospect have no impressive qualities. Then Madoka learns about Mahou Shoujo who fight in secret to defend society. They fight entities called \"Witches\" that spread distress and anxiety. If you're expecting a happy-bubbly slice-of-life, you couldn't be anywhere further away from the mark. Mahou Shoujo Magica Madoka is a very dark anime. It quickly shifts from drinking tea to suicide's with unsettling skill. The characters are a whole lot more complex than the average Mahou Shoujo - where the characters often don't develop at all, within the first few episodes so much development occurs that you might be wondering if you're watching the same anime (and the development is presented incredibly believable). With Urobuchi Gen on staff mind shattering moments are abundant. Gen has even come out straight and said this is an anime that can be understood even better re-watched. The characters are a lot more in depth than you would expect from a Mahou Shoujo, and are surprisingly realistic. If you want moe~moe~ magical girls, then please refrain from watching Mahou Shoujo Magika Madoka, because Madoka deals a lot more with relationships and human issues than it does try to be cute and funny. Yoshinoya-Sensei also plays a cameo (but she's wearing a wig so watch carefully).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is your brain on drugs. Cue Freezepop's song Brainpower.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Madoka has an uncanny knack for going from quaint to disturbing incredibly fast. It also has the ability to BLOW YOUR MIND. So go watch it, okay?\\n\\n\r\nAfter the final episodes have aired, I can say with confidence, if you're willing to brave through the first three episodes that totter between \"cliche Magic Girl anime\" and \"mysteriously dark\" then you'll be pleasantly surprised that the latter is what you'll receive throughout. Madoka ranks with very few anime. It is one that start with a whimper and ends with a whimper, but is packed with bangs throughout.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe following are notes I added after each episode aired between January 7th, 2011 and April 22nd, 2011:\\n\r\nPS: I WISH MY MOM GAVE HI FIVES LIKE MADOKAS DOES\\n\r\nWHAT AN EXECUTIVE\\n\r\nPS2: GIGA MUSKETTT BUREEAKKKKERRRRRRRR... and imma sip some tea now.\\n\r\nPS3: Needs a hardware update.\\n\r\nPS4: I cry out of fear watching this.\\n\r\nPS5: fat chicks yum\\n\r\nPS6: DON'T PLAY WITH MY EMOTIONS LIKE THAT HOMG\\n\r\nPS7: I can see Kyouko being all like \"GIMME ALL YO FOOD, OR I WILL EAT YOU\"\\n\r\nPS8: Fried Kyubey on a Stick - A southern American delicacy\\n\r\nPS9: I think I'm watching a Darren Aronofsky production\\n\r\nPS10: I liked this episode because they explained Homura's hair.\\n\r\nPS11: Battler would approve of this end",

            "content": "It's long been the case that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on certain genders and age groups, and this fact is most apparent when one considers the mahou shoujo category. From Sailor Moon and Tokyo Mew Mew to Pretty Cure and Shugo Chara, the titles on offer that feature the exploits of one or more magical girls all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, cute outfits, cute sidekicks, \"cute\" costume changes, twinkly/sparkly/sugary atmospheres, and a penchant for appealing to the sensibilities of 7 to 14 year old girls.\r\nThen there are the anomalous titles that deviate from the triedand tested approach as they attempt to broaden the horizons of the genre, the most successful example being Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha. The franchise gave audiences a chance to see Takamichi Nanoha grow from a very young and naive magical girl into the Ace of Aces for the Time-Space Administration Bureau, and combat instructor to the next generation of heroes. The surprising thing though, is that somewhere along the way the series managed to successfully bridge the shoujo-shounen divide, which is a difficult thing to do in a genre that's generally aimed at girls who still think bright (sometimes almost fluorescent), pink is a good colour to wear.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are only a few good titles on offer that have broken with the traditional mahou shoujo mould, which isn't surprising if one considers the difficulty of the task in question - take something for young girls and make it appeal to as broad a fan base as possible. Then again, Shaft seem to relish that sort of challenge, and while their take on magical girl anime retains a certain \"fluffiness\" that is prevalent in the more stereotypical shows, Puella Magi Madoka\u2605Magica is an altogether different beast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a young girl looking for and exit with which she can escape a strange black and white checkered area, but instead of finding the outside world she finds that surreal destruction has come to Mitakihara City as a dark haired girl fights a very odd creature in the sky. A small white animal named Kyuubey advises her that she has the power to help the dark haired girl, to change this fate of grief and destruction, to be granted her heart's desire. All she has to do is make a contract and become a Puella Magi ...\\n\\n\r\nAnd then she wakes up.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the rather dramatic first few minutes the storyline takes on a fairly staid measure as the main plot is laid out and the characters are introduced, but while the narrative is relatively well constructed, it's not without its flaws. The series has a tendency towards melodrama that can sometimes slow the pace of events, and this brings into focus certain aspects of the plot which are very clearly designed to evoke a sympathetic reaction from the audience. In addition to this, while the rather obvious influence from Buddhism (the whole deal with maintaining balance, karma, etc), is prevalent for much of the show, the decision to broadcast the final episode on a specific date only serves to highlight the reference to Christian beliefs that forms the grand finale. That said, it's easy to overlook these as the main thrust of the storyline is entertaining , and much darker than one might initially expect, especially when one considers the character design and everyday scenery.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is interesting is the manner in which the writing team have tied in the importance of the third wish to the whole concept of resurrection (ask me if you want an explanation), which may sounds a bit strange at first but it actually works rather well, especially as the traditional \"deal with the devil\" scenario generally doesn't have any kind of achievable escape clause.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there are two problems with the storyline, both of which aren't immediately obvious. The first is the assumption that only girls of a certain age are ideal for becoming Puella Magi, with all that entails. The justification for this is debatable, and brings up the whole idea that \"boys don't cry\". The storyline is built upon the concept that adolescent girls are more emotionally unstable than boys of that age, yet this is an untrue statement for two reasons, the first one being that boys are also undergoing physical and emotional changes. The second reason is that boys are taught from a very young age that they shouldn't cry or show certain emotions, and the continuous bottling up of all those feelings more often than not manifests itself during the adolescent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that a race as advanced and intelligent as the one in Madoka\u2605Magica would have known this, and would have experimented with male Puella Magi as well, yet the story makes no reference to this. Quite the opposite in fact, and the explanation given states very clearly that all Puella Magi throughout history have been female.\\n\\n\r\nAnd before you ask, there are such things as male witches in the realm of the occult. They're called Warlocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe second flaw is the explanation given as to why Kaname Madoka has more potential than anyone else, which again makes a major, yet highly debatable assumption. The simple fact is that if one follows the idea to its rather logical conclusion, the most powerful Puella Magi should actually be Akemi Homura. It's a far more conceptual plot hole, but given the usage of the many worlds theory, especially at the end, it quickly becomes a major issue that could destroy the foundation of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's a good thing the series is as entertaining as it is.\\n\\n\r\nNow given that this is an anime by Shaft one might well expect a degree of experimentation with the visuals, and the opening sequence gives viewers some very clear signs of things to come. The character design is very similar to that of Hidamari Sketch, and while this adds a degree of cuteness to the show, it also emphasises the stark difference between the Puella Magi and the witches, especially in terms of their humanity.\\n\\n\r\nThe experimental nature of the series is prevalent during the combat sequences, and Shaft really have gone to town in creating surreal, mind bending environments that serve as a home for the witches, and the arena in which the Puella Magi must fight. The mixture of animation techniques on display during these scenes is surprising, not only in terms of application but also in quality, which is why it's somewhat disappointing that there are occasions where entire frames have been left out of the animation during everyday events.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Madoka\u2605Magica is a good looking anime for the most part, even though much of the effort has been expended on crafting imaginatively unusual other world settings and surreal enemies for the girls to fight. Strangely, this may actually be purposeful as while the everyday environments are colourful yet mundane, like the character design these emphasise the difference between the real world and the one in which the Puella Magi must combat the witches.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Connect by ClariS, is a fairly uplifting J-pop song that's set against a surprisingly routine (for mahou shoujo anime), sequence, all of which belies the darkness of the story proper. Thankfully the ending theme, Magia by Kalafina, is more in keeping with the atmosphere of the anime, especially with the ephemeral approach to visuals. The series is also littered with a variety of background tracks that are generally appropriate in their usage, and one of the high points of Madoka\u2605Magica is the quality of the audio choreography.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the acting, the cast is made up of experienced seiyuu who add depth and nuance to proceedings, for example Kato Emiri's role as the amorally enigmatic Kyuubey really is something to see, especially with her off hand explanations and her ability to make the character sound devoid of emotion. The rest of the cast also perform very well, except for one, but the issue isn't actually with her skills. Yuuki Aoi (Kaname Madoka), generally works well with the other seiyuu and delivers her lines with a decent amount of passion, but she's unable to express the true depth of emotion that the character feels because the script simply does not allow for it, which is a shame as it's a minor blemish on a very good performance.\\n\\n\r\nScripting issues aside, it's interesting to note that the series seems a bit lacking in core characterisation, especially as Madoka, Sayaka, and Mami have personalities that verge on the mundane. It's this averageness that makes the story that little bit more accessible to audiences, even though some rather fantastic back stories have been used to justify the actions of one character or another. Which brings up an interesting issue with the developmental process as rather than try for an intuitive approach, Shaft and Aniplex have applied the \"growth by numbers\" method. Each character is given the opportunity to adversely affect Madoka in some way, and the order in which this occurs is dependent on the relationship between the two. The problem is that this methodical approach is in clear conflict with the experimental nature of the series, and while it can easily be overlooked or forgiven due to the entertaining nature of the story, it's still not what one would expect from a studio like Shaft.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit that at first I was expecting nothing more than another cutesy mahou shoujo anime, so finding something that was more to my tastes was a bonus. That said, the series isn't without its flaws, but these can either be ignored outright or forgiven as the story is a very interesting and unusual take on what it means to be a magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just not as groundbreaking as some might believe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Madoka\u2605Magica may at first seem like a totally unique concept, it should be remembered that the Nanoha franchise possessed some dark themes, Black Rock Shooter featured a young girl's alter ego fighting strange creatures in a surreal other world, and Uta Kata tried to show the breakdown of a person who becomes controlled by their power. There are other shows that explore some of the themes of the series, sometimes in more detail, but in truth these are only minor niggles as Shaft have managed to create  a mahou shoujo anime that, like those that came before, successfully displays the true potential of the genre.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leaves only two questions. If Shaft wanted to experiment with the genre, then why not go the whole hog and have a mahou shounen? Why leave that sort of thing to comedy anime like Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka?",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka\u2606Magica managed to do what I thought was impossible - took over the position of my favorite TV anime series from the first Suzumiya Haruhi series, while still airing. And my rating of was only rising with every subsequent episode.\r\nEven though the story starts like any typical magical girl anime, you can clearly see it is going to be different from the very beginning - it is the girls' choice, not fate, to go on the path of magic. Being a magical girl is rather a cold business deal rather than a divine blessing. And magic is not a perfect cure for everything- using it can cause a strong and hard-to-predict backlash. All that is there as early as in the first two episodes. And then episode 3 happens, and while trying not to spoil the story, I must say that all hope of this series being a normal magical girl show is lost since then. Beginning with episode 3, Madoka\u2605Magica follows the Hitchcockian principles of storytelling - with every following episode there is some unpleasant surprise, we can't wait to see what happens next - oh, how convenient it will be for all those watching Madoka after the whole series' original airing...\\n\\n\r\nI can't really decide if I should call the story predictable or not. As you may know, the show has spawned an enormous amount of speculation and discussion on 2ch, 4chan and throughout the anime fandom in general. As the story went on, many of these speculations turned out to be true. When following the discussions on the Web, it's hard to tell if the story would be predictable to a lone viewer or not. But one thing is certain - Urobuchi and Shinbou managed to tell the story in such a way that even when you know what's going to happen, everything is still exciting and makes a huge emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nAll of us fans were anticipating the finale, with much speculation about the ending going on. Since the actual last episode aired, opinion about the ending varies greatly between the fans - but my personal opinion is that the ending is as great as the whole show. Of course I won't go as far as to explain the ending, but what actually makes the ending good is its... well, I'd say ambiguity, but it's on a meta-level. There are ongoing discussions even whether the ending is ambiguous or not! It makes you think, interpret it your own way, and no thought is better than any other - but at the same time, it is not an open ending, the story is completely concluded. It is truly a sign of very good writing by Urobuchi Gen. It's often said that Madoka is the same to the magical girls genre what Evangelion was to the mecha genre years ago. And I won't be surprised if it'll end up becoming a cult classic of comparable caliber.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is heavily character-driven, with many events happening because of the characters revealing their feelings to each other. Even though many characters are quite clear from the beginning, nothing is certain, as the world - and other characters - constantly turn out to be different than we all thought. There is no white and black, characters are deep and believable, which is certainly one of the key factors of this show's enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is quite unusual for Shaft, because it is very serious in atmosphere. There is not much comedy, and when there is, it's very subtle and natural in tone. This also means we won't be seeing Shaft's signature walls of flashing text and pushy creative typography (it's still there, though, in much less obtrusive form of runes). The art still manages to be very \"Shafty\" in tone, however. Slightly futuristic backgrounds, heavily inspired by recent architecture of the real world, look quite similar to what we've seen in Bakemonogatari - but are usually less symbolic and significantly more polished. The characters were designed by Aoki Ume of Hidamari Sketch fame, and bear significant resemblance to that series. Such bright and happy character designs may feel out of place for a series so dark in tone, but it's aiming for an effect much similar to what Higurashi did few years ago - and it actually works here, too. Unusual proportions of Aoki's drawings feel a bit strange at the beginning, but it's easy to get used to it after an episode or two, and then both background and foreground art blend well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe closed worlds where witches reside, deserve a separate paragraph. Shaft employed Gekidan Inu Curry for this part, and their creative potential truly shines there. The art is very abstract, animated with stop-motion and similar techniques, feeling considerably out of place, while still working out well. These visuals are often compared to opening animations of Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei seasons by fans, and Shaft's fans should recall this kind of art in other works of this studio, too.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about voice acting is not really much necessary - there are many well-known and popular names in the cast, which alone gives some degree of warranty for the quality. The voices match respective characters' personalities well, too. There's nothing much more I can say about that. The music, on the other hand - it really adds up to the overall feel. The opening theme by ClariS (known for OreImo OP) builds up a nice innocent atmosphere... soon to be brutally broken by the plot and BGM, composed by Kajiura Yuki, best known as the founder of Kalafina - who also performs the outstanding ending theme - and for Kara no Kyoukai's soundtrack. Her instantly recognizable style fits astonishingly well with Madoka's atmosphere, and builds both a considerable tension and atmosphere of mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGMs, though well-fitting, didn't stand out much for me at first. But with the progress of the story, with the mood getting darker and story more absorbing, the music also started to make more impact and I can even say that it has become catchy. The style of the soudtrack also shifts significantly during the finale, which makes it feel even more epic. Overall, I don't know if the whole OST will be worth owning, but there are few tunes which I'd really like to have is my music collection.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Puella Magi Madoka\u2606Magica has got everything a good visual entertainment should have. I can only deplore that anime is somewhat looked down on outside the otaku community, because I truly believe that anime non-fans would also enjoy it. And the title sounds somewhat embarassing, too - but it's a perfect proof for that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nEdits:\\n\r\nMarch 12th - updated after episode 10.\\n\r\nMarch 14th - reworded some fragments according to a reader's notes.\\n\r\nApril 23rd - updated after the final episodes.",

            "content": "We all have things in life that we treasure and hold close, whether it be friends, family, possessions, dreams, or just life itself. We tell ourselves that we will do everything in our power to preserve them, that we would never risk betting and losing them. But what, one day, you were given the opportunity to be granted a wish? A miracle, with no limits, that could give you something that you always wanted. Would you be willing to risk losing everything, the things you treasure, your humanity, and even your life, to have that one wish granted? If you would, would you regret it,would you curse it, or would you fight to protect it? Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, or Puella Magi Madoka Magica, whichever you prefer, centers around these questions and gives us an outlandish tale of love and friendship, and how it can all disappear in the blink of an eye. Madoka, or \"Dokes\" as the internet now loves/hates to call it, has become a phenomenon in the anime community since it's release in 2011, garnering endless praise and a massive fandom in Japan and in the West, and like all popular works, the question that always arises is, does it deserve it? Well let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn a vague futuristic city in Japan, lives a girl named Madoka Kaname. She's entirely ordinary, and not very talented, but she treasures her life nonetheless and loves her family and friends entirely. But one day a mysterious transfer student named Homura Akemi gives her a warning, that if she truly loves her life and the people around her, that she shouldn't do anything that would change it. Her warning quickly becomes prevalent as she meets a mysterious being in the shape of a cute fuzzy entity named Kyubey that offers to turn her and her friends into magical girls. They will be granted one wish to gain these powers and in return they will be obligated to fight the witches that hide in the shadows of their city. Then..... well i can't really say. Basically everything that follows that basic description could be labeled as a spoiler, so if you want to know more, i suggest you watch the series for yourself. Hint though, if you're familiar with the works of Faust and Hans Christian Andersen, you might get some kind of clue as to what goes on.  After 3 years since its premiere, it's common knowledge now that Madoka is not the moe fluff that it appears to be. There are many fans out there that will describe the show as a dark subversion that deconstructs the magical girl genre, and to this claim, i say that it's true. In the first two minutes of the anime, Madoka shows that it's not the happy-go-lucky magical girl anime from our childhoods, but a dark story that, along the way, points at some of the flaws and inconsistencies of the magical girl genre. But the thing is, Madoka is not good because it's a dark subversion. Madoka is good because it's terrifically written and has ended up being one of the few good modern tragedie. Nothing the show presents to us feels arbitrary or manipulative, but it feels inevitable, as though there was no way around it, even though our own ideals hoped that reality would stop crashing down on these girls. Of course this only works because the writing in the show is airtight, filled with foreshadowing, both subtle and obvious, and not wasting a single moment on scenes that could be considered meaningless filler, there is purpose to every interaction and every conversation. In fact there's so much detail in these short 12 episodes, that it doesn't just give it rewatch value, but it practically demands to be watched more than once, and from personal experience, it just gets better with each viewing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Madoka was done by Studio Shaft, a studio known for it's high animation quality and obtuse visuals, and who i personally dislike for their vanity. Yet, i acknowledge good work when i see it, and to say their work on Madoka is just good is an understatement. Madoka's design has one thing that most moe shows lack, distinction. Their color palate, their ordinary pastels made extraordinary by crayon tones, and a certain flexibility that makes you really appreciate the work put into it. Not to say anything about the ever present city itself, large in scale, and containing areas both lavish and hollow. As the series progresses, the city continually gets more bleak and ill-boding to fit the tone, yet never losing the presence that it's had since the first episode. Still the highlight of the shows visuals is easily the witches labyrinths. Each of them is abnormal, outlandish, and unique with different themes and designs for each one, like one is designed after a hospital, another looks like a scrap book, and my personal favorite is where everyone in the labyrinth is depicted as a silhouette. It's unorthodox to it's core, and like the city, only gets more grim and uncomfortable as the series progresses. Not to say anything about the animation which meets the usual Shaft standards of high quality, with fluid and fast paced action scenes, and the notorious \u201csideways glance\u201d that we see in every single Shaft anime. Madoka is art from anyway you look at it, and it's visuals to good to match it. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe score for the show was done by, Yuki Kajiura. Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks are well known for shedding a tear or two, and Madoka is no different. With a glorious blend of synths and electric orchestra's, weeping strings and piano, and, of course, a towering choir, the soundtrack to Madoka is attention getting to say the least. Haunting, mysterious, and at times sad, needless to say, the OST is good, almost too good in fact. It's actually kind of hard to talk about the soundtrack because it's, honestly, just something you have to listen to for yourself. As for voice acting, i'll have to go sub over dub. It's kind of hard for me to judge Japanese voice acting since, I myself, do not speak Japanese, but still, it's not hard to notice a great performance when you hear one. In Madoka, it just so happens, that all of the actors are equally great, both subtle and overwrought for whichever situation. As for the dub, well, it's listenable. To be fair, it's not a bad dub, but it's not very natural sounding and very wooden on places. I will give special props to Cassandra Lee Morris for her performance as Kyubey. She obviously got what kind of character it was and captured its essence enough to rival its Japanese counterpart. If you prefer dubs then go ahead, the dub doesn't really do anything to hurt it, but i recommend the Japanese track. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs a tragedy, Madoka only works to it's fullest with the stellar cast of characters they provide, although it may not seem that way from an limited standpoint. By limited standpoint, i mean those who follow a formula to judge what makes a character, one such as \"background A + situation B = reaction C\" characterization\", rather them what's in front of you. The characters are humanized beyond their archtypes and over time, things like motivations change and the characters are corrupted by a situation that, despite being ideal candidates for, none of them were mentally, physically, or emotionally prepared for. Of course, in classic tragic fashion, the situation was a near impossible one that could've been avoided, if not for their own personal flaws. Their naivete, their desperation, their love, their desire, even things that seem like good attributes like kindness and courage prove to be more harmful than they seem. This is brought out through the contrast of the rookie magical girls and the veterans, those who went in with hope and the best of intentions, and those who have learned the hard way about the price of being a magical girl. Of course this applies to all the main cast, except for two. The first being out ordinary protagonist, Madoka, who consistently goes through the series with a justified indecisiveness towards becoming a magical girl, feeling the guilt of not doing her part, but fearing for what will come when she makes her wish. Her natural sense of what's right and what isn't, her own insecurities, and being witness to the consequences that unfold is what ultimately drives her character throughout the series, slowly building her up until the climax, and while she isn't the best of the characters, she is the one most suited for being the main protagonist. Then there's Kyubey, who i sadly can't go into much detail over, so i'll just give you the gist of it. Kyubey is the representation of logic versus emotion, and the needs of the many versus the needs of the one. It's indifferent towards the ideas of good and evil and acts however it feels is necessary to get what's needed. The mere fact that i've been using it for Kyubey, over him or her, should be indication that Kyubey is more than it originally seems. There's not much to talk about outside of the main cast, as there's only 6 other characters that aren't just nameless background fodder, but they still contribute their fair share to the story. The conversations between Madoka and her mother Junko often reveal a lot, how close they are, how much Madoka admires her, and often works as vessels for foreshadowing, and were always interesting to watch. Madoka and Sayaka's friend Hitomi is another story. She's not a bad character, but her switch from comic relief to super serious seemed a bit sudden, but even that's just a nitpick. The characters is Madoka are surprisingly complex and give off more than enough humanity to make this series exceed expectations. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi has stated in interviews that his intention with Madoka was to make an interesting, thought-provoking, fantasy set in an established genre. Did he succeed? More than i could've ever expected. Madoka is a masterfully written modern tragedy that works on par with classic european literature. Some may claim that Madoka is nothing more than shock factor with cute girls designed to be an instant hit, to which i recommend you rewatch it since you missed the point of what the series is about in the first place. As for others, while i can't guarantee that you'll like the series as much as i do, as with any other work, but i recommend you watch it, sooner than later. Few series seems to hit every target, from characters, to story, to themes, and work every way, inside and out, to make a series as, for lack of a better word, perfect. Anyways, that's all for now, til next time.",

            "content": "I feel like I'm in the minority here on MAL, and that's kinda depressing. Madoka Magica by and large is one of those programmes which receives no shortage of praise that I simply can't agree with one way or the other. I wouldn't mind it so much were it not for the fact that any sort of valid criticism or complaints anyone has with this series is instantly lost in a sea of downvotes and angry rants made by rabid fans who're breathing heavily whilst typing on their keyboards rapidly. Regardless, I'll make a feeble attempt at getting my voice heard. Will it work? Probablynot, but it's still worth a try.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really baffles me is how Madoka Magica is a moe drama along the lines of Elfen Lied and yet people praise Madoka ad nauseum whilst talking shit about Elfen Lied at every available opportunity. Even people like JesuOtaku who generally have no patience for moe dramas ended up giving this programme a glowing review despite the fact that Madoka Magica and Elfen Lied end up trying to accomplish similar goals. It's amazing as to how much the power of emotions can override one's better judgement but then again, maybe that's why I couldn't get into it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just get this out of the way first: moe drama by and large is an extremely manipulative genre at its core that's rather poorly written in general. Why is this the case? Well, the writers know all too well that most viewers will gladly put up with all this shit so long as they get their cute girls in anguish that they can fantasise about consoling and/or fucking. Obviously, Madoka Magica has quite a way's worth of better writing put into it than Elfen Lied does but it still falls prey to the same traps that plague moe drama when it comes down to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first biggest problem that Madoka Magica has is the fact that the pacing is horrendously rushed. I don't care what you have to say about the pacing, because quite frankly... it's shit. The 12 episodes we were given did not allow for the events taking place in the story to flow naturally and instead make this programme come off as a rather forced melodrama. Something is horrendously wrong with your programme if I cannot bring myself to feel even the slightest modicum of emotion for what transpires despite the characters making a big deal of it all.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the rushed pacing, another glaring flaw that Madoka Magica suffers from is the fact that it's heavily reliant on shock value, which is probably another big reason as to why this anime is so lauded in the first place. Shock is a powerful emotion indeed and it can definitely work to great effect to further strengthen the writing whenever necessary. The problem is that Madoka Magica goes out of its way to shock the viewer and then ultimately relies on manipulating your emotions to keep you invested and distract you from the flaws in the writing. People are definitely going to disagree with me on this one but please hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe way Madoka Magica's been marketed in the past by Aniplex is a dead giveaway that shock value is a major cornerstone of Madoka Magica as a whole. The trailers, the OP, and even the blurb on the back of the Aniplex DVD release basically paint this show out to be your typical magic girl show despite the fact that it couldn't be further from the truth. Granted, a lot of the punch has been taken out of that sort of marketing tactic given that Madoka has become so popular to the point where it's essentially common knowledge that this is a dark, angst-ridden magic girl melodrama but the point still stands.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like Madoka Magica was fundamentally designed to be a smash hit. The very combination of shock and moe drama has been a proven formula for success (look at Elfen Lied if you want an example). However, Madoka Magica takes this a step further by being a magic girl show. Magic girl programmes (and battle shonens to a similar extent) suffer from this \"image\" that exists in the minds of most people as nothing more than childish drivel about friendship and idealism that can't grow the fuck up. Given the fact that Madoka Magica is a shocking moe drama as well as a magic girl show, the end result is basically having thousands of fans saying that Madoka isn't like other magic girl shows and is a definite must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Madoka isn't like most other magic girl programmes but then again, neither is Kill la Kill or Princess Tutu. A series doesn't automatically become a masterpiece just because it \"breaks the mould\" as the saying goes. If that were the case, films like \"The Room\" would have to be considered masterpieces of drama despite evidence to the contrary. Don't get me wrong: individuality in anime is a good thing, especially given all the repetition going on in the industry. What isn't good is relying on being different to be your main selling point. This isn't to say that Madoka doesn't have any other merits to stand on, rather the very merits it does have are flawed to high heaven.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is often praised to no end as a deconstruction of magic girl anime. Yeah... I don't buy it. You mean to tell me that all it takes to be a deconstruction is psychologically torturing your characters whilst going out of your way to be as dark and edgy as possible? I thought there was more subtlety involved with the writing when it comes down to deconstructions. Say what you will about Evangelion, but one thing that Gainax has that SHAFT lacks in its entirety is tact. Don't get me wrong, subtlety isn't exactly Evangelion's strong suit either but it certainly has more than Madoka does, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWe got to spend a good deal of time in our typical mech setting before shit got morbid and we realised that being a mecha pilot in the world of Eva isn't a walking sex fantasy. Sure, Evangelion sends us flying head-first into the plot like Madoka does, but once again: we're given time to actually connect with the characters which is something that Madoka's 12-episode runtime simply doesn't allow for. I understand that the length of a show isn't necessarily indicative of whether or not the characters are good because there definitely are 1-cour programmes that deliver quite a bit on the character front (i.e. White Album 2, OreGairu, Usagi Drop, etc). At the same time, this story contains far too much content for it to actually work with the 1-cour length.\\n\\n\r\nI know that some people like to tout this 12-episode length as a strength, saying that it's free from all the unnecessary bullshit that plagues other magic girl shows and goes straight into the good stuff. While I can certainly reciprocate that praise to a certain degree (especially given that Madoka Magica is far more engaging than Sailor Moon is), people fail to understand that without the boring parts of a show, the good bits wouldn't be nearly as good and would instead become mediocre. Princess Tutu understood this concept quite well as it was able to balance out the otherwise boring bits about ballet with the deliciously macabre moments involving Drosselmeyer. Madoka has no such balance.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that the 1-cour length brings up is an over-reliance on plot twists. Now, plot twists aren't inherently bad and can definitely work to the show's advantage if it was given proper foreshadowing. Unfortunately, the short length doesn't allow for foreshadowing of any kind to really happen so they just take you by surprise (oh look, more shock value!). I don't know about you, but these plot twists don't do much of anything for me. In fact, it made me question the logic behind this show even more. I'd question why shit had to constantly get worse for the characters in every episode, but then I remember that this is moe drama and that it doesn't matter how nihilistic the world actually gets so long as we still have our cute girls writhing in anguish.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really surprises me about Madoka is the fact that despite being a sadistic viewer who loves seeing cute things being crushed by nihilism, this show was enough to make *me* do a double take on what's being shown. Make no mistake: I couldn't find myself feeling any modicum of emotion (not even pity) for Madoka, Homura, Sayaka, Kyoko, and Mami but at the same time... there was just something rather unnerving about how their circumstances just kept getting worse by the minute. It doesn't help that the short length also brings up stuff that may very well qualify as fridge horror or unfortunate implications (I don't know which trope it is, so bear with me).\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the fact that magic girls have to be adolescents because apparently, they're emotionally volatile at that age range brings up so many questions that just don't get answered. For one thing, does this mean that boys that are of the same age don't go through emotional turmoil like teenage girls do? What of teenage girls who happen to suffer from psychological disorders/trauma? Why does Kyubi opt to only focus on teenage girls when there are many other people of both genders across all age ranges that are just as emotionally volatile if not moreso? There's also the concept of power with a price.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole \"power with a price\" concept is not uncommon in TV, film, manga, comics, literature, etc and there have been many twists on the same formula. Madoka tries to do this concept but it doesn't go all the way with it because of the lack of world-building. Because of that, it would seem that the price the girls have to pay is unending psychological torture which is all somehow the girls' faults by the end of it all. Basically, Madoka's flat-out telling you that you're fucked if you decide to remain a Muggle because you're going to die regardless and yet you're fucked if you become a magic girl because it means you'll go through continuous psychological torment. At the same time, it's also telling you that you'd be much better off as a Muggle because of the fact that you're going to die a lonely, merciless death where nobody's going to remember you if you choose to be a magic girl.\\n\\n\r\nNow I could bring up the whole wish fallacy argument that plagues other shows that involve wishing, but then you have to remember that all the wishes that the girls made in Madoka horribly backfired because apparently, the wishes that the girls made were really selfish even though they seemed selfless at first. Even if Madoka herself was to make a wish like being able to grant her own wishes exactly as she intends for them to come out, there's no telling how horribly it can backfire because the world this show takes place in is an extremely cruel and nihilistic one. This actually brings me over to another problem I have with the show: how sexist it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nI don't consider myself a feminist of any flavour, nor can I say whether or not a specific programme is female-positive media because I'm a guy. At the same time, I don't understand how people can just let all this bullshit slide. Have people forgotten that women have been pressured for millennia to be as selfless as possible and to put their own desires to the side? What's so wrong about wanting to be with the person you love? What's so wrong about not wanting to die or to actually eat something for dinner? Madoka's logic in and of itself is something that really just doesn't sit right with me one way or the other.\\n\\n\r\nAm I reading too much into Madoka? I don't even know at this point, but there's no denying that there are many fundamental flaws that exist within Madoka Magica as a whole. However, there's this one aspect of Madoka that never ceases to piss me off more than anything else and that's how it ends. For a show that spends 11 episodes psychologically torturing its characters, I'd expect for the show to at least end on a downright depressing note but that's not the case at all. In fact, Madoka Magica's ending couldn't be happier. Fans like to say that the ending wasn't completely happy, but we all know that the circumstances the ending presents to us are infinitely better than what Homura et al had to put up with for the bulk of this show's run. \\n\\n\r\nI don't understand how a show can simply spend 11 episodes saying that ideals will only result in permanent suffering only to do a complete 180 at the final episode and say that hope, happiness, and whatnot will always prevail. Then again, Madoka Magica IS a moe drama and we all know that moe dramas wouldn't be as successful if they don't end on *some* semblance of a happy note (I'm looking at YOU, Clannad: After Story!). One thing's for certain though, this ending is something that I take umbrage with on so many levels because it just forces a happy ending out of nowhere, which is the kind of ending that I really just can't stand.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Madoka Magica is certainly an interesting beast to tackle indeed. I wouldn't call it average in the slightest because it managed to evoke this much of a reaction out of me and it's definitely a cut above the more typical entries of the magic girl genre. At the same time, this show gets far too much praise than it actually deserves. I'm not saying it's terrible, because it really isn't and I suppose you'll have a good time watching it if you don't read too much into the story. Regardless, I don't think Madoka Magica is a \"good\" show. Feedback is always welcome, so with that... I'm gonna start barricading my house so that you rabid Madoka fans don't come at me with the intentions to kill me. Peace.",

            "content": "\u201cAs much as I wished for the happiness of one, someone else must be equally cursed. That\u2019s how the story of a magical girl goes\u2026\u201d\r\nI finally understand why one should not judge a book by its cover.  To be honest, I never liked the design of the characters in Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and I\u2019m sure there are those out there (like me) who may be skeptical with this show due to that fact alone.  I mean \u2026 doesn\u2019t the swollen, flattened, wide, and overblown faces turn you off?  It sure did for me.  But boy, I cannot describe how glad Iam now after marathoning Madoka\u2605Magica in two days (despite all the assignments, projects, and exam deadlines)!\\n\\n\r\nSo what can you expect out of this show?  Certainly not the typical magical girl story one would be expecting.  Taking place in a futuristic world, the story started off like most other magical girl series.  School setting, bunch of young girls hanging around together, the typical \u201chappy care-free\u201d life.  But that quickly changed as the pace of the story drastically increased as well as the mood darkens at the same time.  Soon the viewers are engulfed with deep hatred and sorrow and a wide range of emotions that will only leave one hanging and lust for more.  To say Madoka\u2605Magica is an emotionally driven show is not an overstatement.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is just as brilliant as the story itself.  With the new junior high duo ClariS doing the opening theme and Kalafina doing the ending theme, that should automatically ring some bell for some hardcore anime followers.  But putting the fame of these singer groups aside, both the opening and ending theme songs for Madoka\u2605Magica are just splendid in itself.  You know how some songs have to grow on you; where you need time to get used to it and even then, it might not be catchy enough for you to fell in love with?  Rests assure there is no such problem with neither the opening nor ending themes for this show.  As if that is not enough, Yuki Kajiura-sama herself is responsible for the BGM, theme song lyrics, and composition!  We all know how emotionally driven her music can be, certainly one of the greatest musician in the industry to date.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. Can\u2019t really say there is a lot of character \u201cgrowth\u201d, BUT, I can safely say they have enormous depth making them more believable and lovable.  The depth mainly comes from the background stories of the girls.  Viewers will find out why each girl chose to become a magical girl and how they live with their choice afterward.  If you are a keen viewer, perhaps you may even be able to see through what each girl represents symbolically and relate their experience throughout the show with our own daily lives.  On that note, I have to give the production studios (SHAFT and Aniplex) credit for a job well done as well as finding the appropriate seiyu to voice cast the respective characters. \\n\\n\r\nOn to our last topic, it\u2019s also one that I have briefly mentioned in the beginning.  Yup, it is regarding the animation of Madoka\u2605Magica.  Surely most of us are familiar with SHAFT and its style of production, but not everyone accepts the way SHAFT handle its own anime.  While one can argue that SHAFT is being creative with their work, which certainly differentiates them from other studio, but for the everyday norm like my humble self I cannot say I appreciate their work of mixing reality into anime to create something nightmare-ish.  By that I do not mean the incorporation of real city sceneries into the anime, but rather, I am referring to the infrequent random usage of flowers, candies, or butterflies that takes away any seriousness to the show.  Perhaps I just don\u2019t understand \u201cart\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I wish to say that as an anime original work (not adapted from light novel or manga like many anime these days), Mahou Shoujo Madoka \u2605Magica certainly deserves some praise.  If I were to describe the excitement level of this show, the closest I can think of is a mathematical exponential curve.  The early episodes serve as the typical story foundation blocks, but right after that is done, you can sure as hell expect an emotional rollercoaster ride =D",

            "content": "Forget everything you thought you knew about the magical girl genre, because Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or MSMM as I'll call it from here on for simplicity) is here to turn the genre upside down.\r\nAt its core, MSMM is a--like its title says--mahou shoujo.  But it's what the series does with the genre that makes it something truly marvelous; the magic is in the execution.  In the beginning, it may seem like any other, set up to be generally innocent, light-hearted, nonchalant, and fun; but by the time ED begins at the end of episode 3, the monster will be revealed for whatit truly is, and its true nature will be fully in the light.\\n\\n\r\nI imagine MSMM's story like a tightly-woven rope kept perfectly taut:  There are multiple sub-stories and issues going on at the same time, but they stay so close together that it may be difficult for one to discern them as individual pieces of the overall work.  Unlike anime whose rope is loosely-woven or frayed (divided into clearly discernable arcs or things don't tie together well) or that curve or coil (ones that lose their way and stray from their path), MSMM stays concise, linear, and tight.  Everything stays together, and it knows exactly where it's going; it's ultimately all the same story.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is consistent and fast; you will definitely be riveted to the edge of your seat.  To some, it may be a tiny bit *too* fast, but I pose that this is because of the distinct lack of \"fluff\": everything is significant--nothing is pointless.  The story is lean and completely free of excess fat.  It picks its direction and chugs there headlong.  It does a perfect job balancing the crucial elements of character development, plot progression, dialog, psychology, action, and emotional tension.  Balancing this many aspects is no small feat, and MSMM is second to none at the job.\\n\\n\r\nEqually as strong and as critical to the series is the cast--also free of excess fat.  It is compact and devoid of unnecessary characters; all of them have a clearly defined role and bounds they do not overstep.  The screen time is allotted appropriately between them.  Each character has a distinct personality and already has depth to them before any development even needs to occur, and the personality that is set up beforehand helps the development they undergo stand out.  Each of the magical girls are unique and go through their own trials and ordeals, which also affect each other; each plays integral roles in shaping other characters and progressing the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe tribulations the magical girls are subjected to is what MSMM is really all about.  They--and you as the viewer--are revealed truths about what it means to be a magical girl that you never would've dreamed of.  The psychological trauma they endure is painted on a dark and cynical canvas of reality for you to experience along with them; the joys and pains as the bonds of friendship are created and strengthened, strained and broken, will play with your heart strings.  If you didn't know what it meant to be sympathetic before, consider this your crash course.\\n\\n\r\nComplementing the anime is a beautiful and stunning OST composed by Yuki Kajiura.  There is always the perfect track to accompany every scene--whether the mood be light-hearted, sad, ominous/foreboding, or exciting/thrilling, you can be guaranteed that the music will be there to help burn the feeling into your heart.  The OP (\"Connect\") is great and serves as a constant reminder of the false sense of security constructed in the early episodes; the ED (\"Magia\") is phenomenal and much more accurately reflects MSMM's true nature (it's also used strategically during a couple scenes in the series, to great effect).  There are some pretty intense sound effects utilized--particularly noteworthy are crashing noises and explosions.  The seiyuu do a stunning job delivering their lines with the perfect levels of emotion and energy.  They make their characters come to life so much so that one may think they've BECOME the character.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may be slightly put off by the somewhat different character designs with their wider faces, but you'll get used to it easily.  The animation in general is pretty spectacular, except for a few scenes where characters are shown coming \"towards us\" and end up looking like they're walking in place.  Other than that, motions are fluid, and action flows wonderfully.  The cinematography is definitely above average, with some pretty creative and interesting camera angles and close-ups.  There is some particularly stunning artwork shown briefly, usually in transitioning from one scene to another--dank, cold alleys; bright blue and green neon bus stops; vibrant, warm, orange sunsets; the glow of lamp posts in the twilight; sprawling gray cityscapes under the shadow of a gathering storm.  One thing I found particularly outstanding was the brilliant use of low-key and ambient lighting:  The lighting harmonizes with the background music to create truly engrossing and vibrant scenes.  Indeed, the manner in which the sound and visuals syngergize with each other creates an immersive and dark stage for events to play out upon.\\n\\n\r\nIn case you haven't caught the drift already, MSMM is an extremely enjoyable experience with substantial rewatch value.  It's one of those rare works that get MORE enjoyable the more you watch it, unlike many whose flaws become more evident, or eventually get old.  Genius incorporation of foreshadowing is so tactful and subtle that you might not even realize it was there until you watch it again.  (Like I said, everything is significant.)  I personally found the entire cast growing on me more and more each time through (except for Kyuubey, because he's a manipulative bastard, but still well-done nonetheless).\\n\\n\r\nMSMM offers much: friendship, drama, psychology, action, story, character development, emotional involvement, and even music and animation--like I said, all working together and balanced beautifully, with no one aspect ever dominating the others: complete harmony.  It's the only anime I'm able to honestly give perfect scores across the board for.  But does that mean YOU will like it?  As I've stated, it's mostly a dark and edgy series with characters enduring intense psychological strain and hardship, and there are times when happiness and hope seem impossible.  The night is darkest just before the dawn, but if you don't think you can take the night, then MSMM probably isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think you CAN handle it, though, by all means:  WATCH THIS SERIES.  It's a deep, exciting, shocking, and powerful ride from beginning to end, and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is a smart and yet cursed show. Many including myself have applauded the show for being a brilliant take and twist on the magical girl genre, a genre that is usually meant to be an inspiration to kids. Madoka Magica changes this concept of Magical Girls by making it realistic. Fighting monsters (or witches in this case) would be a dangerous task in our reality and that is the case in point Madoka Magica tries to bring forward. A great idea on the part of the creators but unfortunately some great ideas can only go too far and the story suffers a bitas a result.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it is the characters that are the best part of the anime. Sayaka, Homura, Mami, and Kyoko are all fascinating to watch and each have their own layered characterization and moral philosophical themes that drive the story forward. Themes such as individual dreams, wishes, societal views and conflicts, relationships, etc... It's all so fascinating and brilliantly told. What is even more amazing about the characters is that they develop not only through great dialogue but also through visual means as well. Characters will change stance and opinions but the audience needs to pay attention to facial expressions and character actions throughout the show in order to determine where and when these amazing characters grew. The main protagonist Madoka is probably the most straight forward character of the bunch. She's definitely less fascinating than the rest of the cast but she is still fun to watch due to her kind nature and expressive personality. She believes herself as being a coward who can't help people, but low and behold she ends up being the smartest, wisest, and bravest of the show. She's a fine character and role model, but not a very deep one. Another little problem I had with the show is the adults of the world are all morons. How come the teenagers are the ones talking smart and philosophical while the adults are the unbalanced irresponsible weirdos who have no clue about anything? Also, there is some questionable character morals that will make you scratch your head and wonder if it is a legitimate reason to be frightened/traumatized, but they are still interesting to ponder about none the less.\\n\\n\r\n*MINOR SPOILER*\\n\r\nFinally we must talk about Kyubey, who is probably one of the greatest villains ever to appear in an anime. This little cat like alien is fascinating in so many ways. He deceits, plots, scams, and lies all the way through the entire series all the while always having a permanent smile on his face (creepy). He tortures and plays around with the lives of these little girls all to further his plans, plans that are a bit understandable but completely unacceptable in the method that he's doing it in. He is the stark contrast of the usual talking cat side kick character found in magical girl shows which is once again the writers trying to play with our expectations. I love this villain yet hate him for being such an awful manipulator. This is exactly how amazing villains should be written.\\n\r\n*END OF MINOR SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nBut now unfortunately we must talk about the curse of the show and how the magical girl theme while being its strength is also its weakness. The reason the Magical Girls genre is targeted to kids is because the premise is meant to make kids feel like they can be heroes with good moral values, but in a realistic premise it is simply ridiculous and implausible. It is also at points very silly because intricate plot details and philosophy concepts are being discussed by teenage girls, girls who have probably only recently been through puberty. There are many times when I simply laughed at serious smart plot discussions because I couldn't believe little girls were talking about such things. Just the concept of Magical Girls itself is ludicrous and yes, the story does try to explain why an alien cat would give little girls powers of incredible strength but it unsurprisingly doesn't make any sense and feels forced. The conclusion as well is a very lame and predictable anime plot ending. I don't want to spoil it but all I got to say is, \"I bow down to our lord and savior Madoka, the perfect moral being!\".\\n\\n\r\nA part from these main gripes in the story, the rest of it is very good. The plot moves along with the character development very well and the main themes of the story are well handled. Themes such as natural order, space and time, etc.. all come together exceptionally well with the themes of the characters in order to create a very fascinating 12 episode anime series. The art is also very good but nothing too exceptional. It does its job well by showing us the character feelings and expressions, but it never \"wowed\" me in any way. I also never got used to the casts chubby looking faces (but that's just a bias opinion). I will say that the art style works well in order to create a magical girl feeling and the action was very well handled. The sound was also amazing in the show. The openings and endings of Madoka Magica worked in with the themes and moods of the series, and I found it very intelligent in how they used it. For example, the ending song of the first two episodes are very happy sounding melodies, which fit in with the happy magical girl mood the show first puts on. But then the third episode is where the series becomes serious and violent, thus it plays with the audience by having the ending song sounding dark and depressing as if it is stating, \"prepare yourselves people because things are about to change\". I like it when shows play around with music like that. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend Madoka Magica to any anime fan. It is a brilliant and adult like take on the magical girl genre. It takes the stereotypes and reverses it. As I explained before, there are limitations to the reversing of this genre, but it is none the less a brilliant effort that deserves praise.",

            "content": "From all the trailers and ads that Aniplex and Shaft released for Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, it seemed that it would be your typical magic girl show, a show along the lines of Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura. However, this had to be purposely orchestrated, as the show is nothing like that and it is clear from it's marketing that Aniplex wanted to surprise people with it, and they did a hell of a job.\r\nThis anime takes everything you know and love/hate about the magical girl genre and flips it 180. The plot starts off with your typical 'Magical Girl' traits and cliches, but soon takesa turn for the dire. This anime's story is dark, really dark. It tackles issues and questions that should, but never really do, arise in other magical girl anime. Though previous magical girl anime have had dark aspects to them, all in all those aspects have never been dark to this extent. The darker than average plot comes as a shock to the viewer that was expecting another cutesy moe anime, but got something totally different. The story is rather complex, and the answers are not given to you. Meaning that you have to figure everything out for yourself, this might be a good/bad thing, depending on your taste. I personally found the story very enjoyable and intriguing. I was not all that fond of the ending mind you and I felt that they could of done a better job with it, but I think that's up to personal preference if nothing else. And it did not break my experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are arguably the show's weakest aspect. They get plenty of development, but as the show goes on, their actions just become more and more unrealistic. I personally liked all the characters, and didn't find anyone annoying or not needed. I also liked their development, and didn't really care for their unrealistic actions. This again depends whether or not you let this kind of thing affect you. Seeing as I'm a sucker for messed up characters, I found Miki Sayaka to be highly enjoyable, and definitely my favorite character of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is great, studio Shaft did a splendid job with the character design and how they contrast the otherwise dark story. Although for some it might be the total opposite, and the characters might reduce your enjoyment of the show. This again is up to personal preference though. The anime gets really gorgeous if you watch it in BD quality. Shaft are known to rush out their products, but they are also known for polishing them up for the Blu-Ray release. So, if possible, do try and watch this show on Blu-Ray, as the animation is vastly improved and adds a lot to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by none other than the masterful Yuki Kajiura. It contains pieces that range from cutesy moe-like themes, to intense battle choruses. And the ending song in particular is very memorable. One thing to note though is that parts of the OST sound really similar to other Yuki Kajiura works. So for instance if you've watcher Kara No Kyoukai, you will hear a lot of similarities, to the point where you can replace songs with one another from both shows, and it wouldn't matter. A minor nitpick. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all  Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is a great anime, and a must watch for anyone that is interested in the psychological genre. It's not the best at what it does, but it comes close to the heavy hitting contenders.",

            "content": "Madoka! An anime that has gotten tons of hype before its initial airing, even more hype once it started, and said hype went through multiple figurative roofs after everyone had watched the first three episodes. Truly this anime has become a phenomena and its just as interesting to watch everyone clamor around it as much as watching the show itself. A little context first though, a while back everyone was whispering about a possible Shaft Mahou Shoujo project with Akiyuki Shinbou attached as the director. In of itself, it wasn't too eyebrow-raising asides from the fact that Shinbou had directed the first season of Nanoha(another Mahou Shoujo series that subverts a lot of the genre's tropes). Nope nobody was really interested until it was revealed that Gen Urobuchi was doing the writing and series composition, Ume Aoki was doing the original character designs and Yuki Kajiura was composing the music. Ignoring Kajiura and Shinbou, simply mentioning that Urobuchi and Aoki were attached was absolutely baffling. I mean one is famed for his grimdark writing style and the other is known for her disgustingly cute drawing style, it doesn't really take a genius to figure out that this anime would be something different. So the hype machine took off and here we are months later all caught up in the veritable frenzy this anime has left in its wake week after week. Does it deserve all the love and the praise it gets? Let's see! \\n\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi is known for a lot of crap, mostly for being one of the writers for Nitroplus and by proxy the brains behind Saya no Uta (a Visual Novel). Now if you haven't read it, I strongly recommend you do. It isn't particularly long so take a few hours out of your schedule and just read through the whole thing in one sitting. You'll thank me for it later. I'm mentioning this because there are a lot of similarities between SnU and Madoka, particularly in the overall themes that are presented in both works. The particular things I'm looking for are mainly subversion and corruption/perversion, which Madoka is rife with. Urobuchi's style really shines when he takes something that is considered sacred and paints in a horrific manner. In this case, he's taking Mahou Shoujo and painting it in the same colors or...dementia he used to paint SnU. Now don't get me wrong, Madoka isn't good because it's a piece of dark fiction, but because its a well-written piece of dark fiction. A lot people get too caught up in its grittiness and play up on how its a revolutionary anime because its DARK AND BROODING. But that's not really the case, it's more like Urobuchi's inherent style melds so well with the genre he's working in. Mahou Shoujo already some entries that take darker approaches to its cliches (the aforementioned Nanoha) and its even got some good deconstructions (Revolutionary Girl Utena and the second half of Princess Tutu). What Madoka does is twisting the guts of the genre only to to pull out every organ slowly and concisely, getting its hands completely bloody in the process while showing the audience the rotted  flesh in its hands. It's plot follows the generic magical girl fight monsters scenario but the actual execution is very different. So much so that it gives off a distinctly different vibe from even the triple A anime in this category. \\n\\n\r\nA good story generally is split up into 3 different Acts, the first is setting the stage, and the third is climax and resolution. The dramatic question comes up in the first act which is pretty much the goal the protagonist must achieve by the third act, and the second is about the protagonist doing what they must to answer the dramatic question. The importance of all that highbrow BS is simply that Madoka has a completely different dramatic question compared to the norm of the genre. In Mahou Shoujo or even Fighting Shounen, the protagonist gets power of some sort of power in the beginning and is asked by the plot whether they can/will defeat/save/restore something of importance. The question posed to Madoka is \"Will you become a Puella Magi (Magical Girl)?\". First things first, we know by definition that if this is the dramatic question, than we know for sure that we won't see Madoka become a Magical Girl half-way through the series or anytime soon for that matter. We know damn well that its going to part of the climax. Dramatic questions usually force the protagonist to be proactive: to change themselves so they are better equipped to tackle the question. Madoka's as you guessed, commands more a reactionary response. This in turn changes the focus to inwards instead of outwards so its fair to say that this is a primarily character-driven anime. Now that's not to say that the plot remains on the backburner for most of show, in contrary it keeps going with or without Madoka driving it. In that regard, both plot and characters are well done, and one isn't really sacrificed for the other. Both work together concisely to drive the experience home. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing Madoka manages to pull off consistently well is the feeling of uncanniness through out the entire show. In good horror/thriller stories, fear is either presented to the audience in three ways: through the \"self\", through \"uncanniness\" and and through the \"other\". Madoka employs all three to startling good effects. The \"self\" aspect really brings out the psychological aspect of the characters, its the parts where they sit down and sort of think aloud to themselves accentuating their thought-process and presenting it to the audience. This happens a lot, and more importantly each character has their own monologue. Its effective because the girls really convey their own fears to the audience and not only that but a lot of that fear is something most of us can relate to. The \"other\" is basically the unknown and things that we cannot understand. For example, all witch scenes and FX that are done by Genkidan Inu Curry. These scenes are very surreal and abstract which is meant to evoke an otherworldly feeling. Or better yet, Kyubey is a very good personification of the \"other\" simply because the audience cannot understand him or his actions with human perceptions and concepts. The final piece is the uncanny, or the feeling that something is slightly off. This is the one horror aspect that is present in Madoka all the time and its there to unsettle the viewer. Its not the direct kind of \"Boo\" horror, but its a more subtle variety which is designed to peeve the audience and to keep them thinking about it long after they've stopped watching. In this anime, there's always something off, and it really adds a lot to the atmosphere. And if I had to pick only one good thing about Madoka, its the atmosphere. Its essentially draped over the viewer like an enormous blanket and can very well become almost suffocating at times. Its something that made Silent Hill 2, and in my opinion also becomes the driving force behind Madoka. Its the one quality that really separates from it from other good anime and pushes it up there with the best of the best. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really incredible and is probably my favorite soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura. The tracks are very beautiful and melodious, and also border on haunting at times. I really cannot describe how important the music is, because it really is the atmosphere at times. If you were to take the soundtrack away from Madoka, it would substantially worsen the final product. It really just draws the audience into itself and the show. While in some other anime the music can be mediocre and even forgettable, over here its absolutely pivotal. The audio design is also great, the right tracks and used at the right moments and are always in sync with the direction or composition of a scene. One thing I'd like to bring attention to is the script which I actually liked a lot. There's not much filler in the dialogue nor are there any meaningless lines. All of it is put to good use which is really pretty rare to see, most anime these days are rarely efficient with the allocation of lines or script writing. Shaft is especially a bit lenient with this quality and most of the dialogue in their anime can be rather gratuitous at times. \\n\\n\r\nHowever if Madoka can be criticized for anything in its presentation, its definitely the animation. The art style itself is good and contrasts heavily with the subject matter, but the animation often leaves something to be desired. While there are some good action scenes and generally the animation fidelity is actually much higher than in other Shaft anime, it's still a bit choppy. There are also a bunch of art errors in every episode (Meduka Meguca anyone?). This does get better as it goes a long, and its apparent that Shaft saved much of the animation budget for later episodes which do look very impressive from an animation stand point (espeically episode 10, GoHands helped out with that one). Hopefully if Shaft ever decides to do a sequel, they'll budget this appropriately and save up all the money, hookers and blow made from the Madoka BD sales. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Madoka is one the best anime to come out in a few years. It's not based off of a manga which is based off of a light/visual novel, it's not a fanservice-ridden sack of crap, its not utterly and completely generic and most importantly its a big breath of fresh air compared to a lot of the anime that have come out recently. If you're not out to hate it the second you start watching, than you should be able to take away a lot of enjoyment from it because like I said in the beginning, it's a hell of a ride. To all the people who have already seen it, I strongly recommend just marathoning the entire series again after a couple months. Because honestly, Madoka will be an entirely different beast when marathoned compared to being watched weekly. The atmosphere practically begs the audience to watch the entire thing in one go and it'll definitely be an experience worth the trouble. For all those who haven't watched it yet, what exactly are you waiting for? More importantly, why are you reading reviews instead of watching this anime? It's a no-brainer, don't make me beg you all to watch it.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica wants be an outstanding show, something that wasn't delivered before, but fails at this feat in pretty much all departments of animation.\r\nIt's commonly conceived as a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre. However Madoka Magica merely twists some aspects of the mahou shoujo genre to give them a dark edge, but does not critically point out any potential flaws of the genre to make its audience question the genre's substance.\r\nStarting off with the most obvious aspect, the visuals, Madoka Magica presents us with a  lot of dark alleys and conversations without much animations going on. The few battles going on duringthe show do provide us with some rather good animations, although the many immersion breaking paper cut-outs are rather forgettable in those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Madoka Magica really wants to be a strong point for the series, often creating a feeling that \"something interesting may happen sometime\" to the audience. The problem is that nothing out of the ordinary actually ever happens. Virtually every single part of the show's story is forseeable, to an extend that a lot of people had actually thought up the show's major plot points much earlier before they had come up during the original airing.\\n\r\nFor an ending that feels like the author was not exactly sure on what it should be like, while not delivering anything new or exciting, Madoka Magica also does not deserve much credit.\\n\\n\r\nHaving spawned dozens of character fan arts, the characters should be the shows strong point, but even here it is lacking substance. Over the course of all 12 episodes, the characters are very hesistant on making decisions and moving on, reducing the show's story to a few stretched out, sometimes very forced key plot elements. Due to this behavior the characters appear very one-dimensional, although the writer's intend on making these characters feel like actual people does shine through occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nTaking all of its flaws in consideration it, I find Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica to be a rather boring show to watch. The action is good and enjoyable, but the characters talking and bitching about the same problems for episodes, and not coming to any interesting conclusions, really wears down on the enjyoment of this anime.",

            "content": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Goethe. Voltaire. William Shakespeare. Charles Dickens. Oscar Wilde. These are some of the most critically acclaimed and influential authors the world has ever seen. They have written texts that have shaped way we perceive the world. They have introduced ideas and philosophies that were previously unimaginable, and as a result left a deep imprint on the Western and Eastern worlds.  But alas, none of them compare to Urobuchi Gen's magnum opus, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Never before was there such a profound piece of art on this level of brilliance. By comparison, all of the other authors mentioned seem like amateur fanfictionwriters. I had a hard time writing that with a straight face, but anyway onto the review.\\n\\n\r\n Madoka Shoujo Madoka Magica is a supposed, \"deconstruction,\" of the magic girl genre. I use the term deconstruction loosely. It gained popularity, or rather notoriety, due its \"deep,\" themes, \"symbolism,\", \"complex\" characters, and of course Urobuchi's trademark cruelty. All of these factors combined should be the recipe for success, correct? Not in this case. Madoka isn't a bad show by any standard. It is a show that reaches for the stars and falls drastically short. \\n\\n\r\nStory(6/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica starts off misleading the viewer into thinking it is just a regular magical girl show. You have a pink haired protagonist with low self-esteem, a blue haired tomboy-esque chick who serves a foil character, and a magical creature that basically grants wishes. This has been the formula for any magical girl anime released in the past decade. However, this is all a facade to mask the fact that Madoka is a relatively dark show. The titular character, Madoka, comes into contact with a strange creature called, QB, who makes her an offer that is hard to refuse. You will be granted one wish, and in return you will become a Magic Girl who has to fight these monstrosities called, \"witches,\" to save the world. Sounds like any young girl from Japan's dream right? However, little does poor Madoka know that their are huge consequences that come with this contract. Very early on in the show, we witness the hardships of being a Mahou Shoujo. Death, loneliness, despair. These are all that await these young girls. Sounds enticing right? Well, the show's execution is flawed and I will explain why.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the show's pacing is off. The viewer is quick introduced to events without sufficient foreshadow or buildup, thus all the plot twists come off as contrived. Madoka would have benefited from being a 24 episode show as opposed to a 12 episode series. Everything comes off as rushed. There is not sufficient world building or anything that makes the show come off as organic in terms of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, there is an over reliance on plot twists but most of these plot twists are simply just shock value. You thought what happened to Character A was awful in every way? No, that was just the beginning, THIS is much worse. And what lessons do we learn from all this suffering and cruelty? Nothing. There is no greater insight in seeing horrible things happen to these girls aside that Urobuchi's sadistic tendencies manifest themselves in interesting ways. The central theme in Madoka is to, \"be careful what you wish for,\" and it is made obvious the first couple times bad things happen to the characters. But constantly adding new twists every couple of episodes to make the main characters lives increasingly harder becomes borderline ridiculousness. It doesn't help that most of these twists seem to come from thin air aside from a few that were alluded to.\\n\\n\r\nThird, it is advertised as a deconstruction but it is anything but. Madoka may be a dark show but dark does not automatically mean deconstruction. At its core, Madoka is the same as every other Magical girl show out there only more edgier. It does nothing to point out the flaws of the magical girl genre and give us deeper insight into what it truly means to put your life on the line for an empty cause. Side point, the show also has underlying misogynistic themes. If you look closely, QB says that many of the great women in history were magical girls but all failed or messed up in some way or form. Is this to say that women are incapable of handling any sort of real power? Who knows, but that is my take on it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)- Mahou Shoujo Madoka was animated by Studio SHAFT, a studio best known for their eccentric animation style. Madoka is a beautiful show. The backgrounds are very detailed and are laden with symbolism. The lighting gives Madoka this dark and ominous feel which adds a lot to the immersion. It makes it very hard to take your eyes off of the show. The character designs are a bit off putting to me though. The faces of the characters are square and a bit pudgy. Pretty weird in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)- The soundtrack was composed by Yuki Kaijura, famous for her works on The Garden of Sinners and .Hack series. This is probably one of her greatest efforts to date. The soundtrack is composed of melancholic soundscapes with occasional orchestrated high energy tracks that suit the more tense fight scenes. The sound direction for this show is truly impeccable as each track captures every moment appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(4/10)- The character aspect is arguably the show's Achilles Heel. The title character, Madoka, has to be the worst character in the show. She starts off with low self-esteem, leading me to believe there is going to be some interesting character development but surprisingly she never changes. The entire show literally revolves around her and yet she does nothing of interest for most of the show. Madoka is a character defined by her environment, a reactionary character if you will. She cries and moans over the bad things that happens to her and her friends, but we rarely ever get a deeper look into her character.\\n\\n\r\nHer best friend, Miki Sayaka is hardly any better. She starts off as brash and bold, but we slowly get to learn more about her character. However, her backstory isn't fleshed out sufficiently to the point where I feel like she is an actual person. Her wish, although understandable, lacks any substance behind it. What I mean is, there wasn't a sufficient explanation as to why she made this wish aside from, I like this guy. As far as we know, there is no deep history between the characters so the wish comes off as stupid to me. Although she does, develop throughout the show, it hardly makes her likable or a better character. Her character developments seem inorganic because once again, they rely on shock value via plot twists. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters such as Akemi and Kyoko are only slightly better but their motivations and reasons behind most of the things they do, don't make sense within the time frame it occurs. Kyoko goes from hating Sayaka in one episode, so much so that she wants to kill her, and in the very next she is revealing to her a sad sob story about her origins. There was no build up. What made her change her mind so quickly? Yes, she did say Sayaka reminded her of herself, but that isn't an adequate reason to change your mind about someone you were going to kill the episode before. Their \"friendship,\" was rushed to the point of disbelief, and didn't make sense. Akemi is the same way, although her situation is slightly more understandable.   But the extent to which Akemi would sacrifice herself for Madoka didn't make sense because they haven't even known each for a year and barely even a month. It does not make sense. Nobody would go through so much turmoil for someone they just met. And Akemi also has a power that was poorly explained and comes off as a plothole but due to spoilers I will not say what it is.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is QB. I felt as though he was the easiest person to empathize with and his reason for making girls sign the contract was understandable aside from a few gripes I have with his reasoning behind it. But I don't think the show wanted me to empathize with someone they painted as a villain, but I felt he was more realistic than the aforementioned characters.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (6/10)- So in conclusion, is Madoka the masterpiece it was hyped up to be? Not at all. It did not do to the Magical Girl genre what Evangelion did to mecha, and at it is core it is the same as all the other anime in its genre. The comparisons made with it being similar to Faust and European literature are superficial and borderline offensive to the authors. Madoka does not match the quality of most literature so I thought I should just put an end to that notion. The reason I am so harsh towards Madoka is because I look at what it could've been and what it is, and I am deeply saddened it turned out this way. However, Madoka is not completely without merit. It is an interesting take on the magical girl genre, and has some phenomenal production values. I would definitely recommend a watch but don't go in with high expectations because they are bound to be crushed.",

            "content": "\"It sucks, but you can't reach a happy ending just by doing what's right all the time.\" - Kaname Junko\r\nNow, there are already quite a few reviews of this anime out there (and more to come, most likely) but since all of them differ in some way, I might as well write mine too. However, the first thing I\u2019ll tell you is that if you haven\u2019t seen this show (or had it spoiled for you), and you have any intention whatsoever to actually watch it, then my tip would be to actually not read too much about the series before watching it...\r\nNow then, let\u2019s getdown to it... I was very much on the fence (and still am) about some of these scores, and whether they should actually be a 9 or 10, so take it with an additional pinch of salt (and remember, a perfect score does not mean it\u2019s all perfect).\\n\\n\r\nStory: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nIn all its simplicity, Madoka\u2605Magica is a breakdown and reconstruction of the \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d genre, in an attempt to make it more realistic and mature. And to be totally honest, they did a fantastic job with this. \\n\r\nThe buildup, plot twists and all the emotional moments in this series really come together to make it all a wonderful experience. Now, I\u2019m aware (and have been told by several people) that the start of the series is quite slow, but I really think that adds to the whole \u201cpsychological\u201d effect of the anime. This isn\u2019t your standard, fast-paced good vs. evil action series with a dash of romance and comedy (as many \u201cregular\u201d magical girl shows tend to be). No, this series is about following the struggle of a few select girls who can have anything they want, in exchange for everything. \\n\\n\r\nAt first there\u2019ll be a lot of questions raised, many left unanswered until almost the end of the series, but thankfully there don\u2019t really exist any gaping plot holes, nor are any questions really left unanswered in the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nAnimation is done by Shaft, and if you\u2019ve seen any of their other works (Monogatari series, Zetsubou sensei etc) then that should be all you need to know. The art is absolutely amazing, which you\u2019ll see from just the first 10 or so seconds of the opening sequence. Aside from the great quality of the art, I really enjoyed the \u201cclean\u201d aesthetics of the environment/backgrounds, and the use of light colors for many of the characters.  \\n\r\nCharacter design is well done, but nothing overly amazing, tho it certainly distinguish all the characters, and makes them more memorable in a way. As for fan service, well... There is none. I mean, there\u2019s not a single indication of fan service anywhere... at all...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn\u2019t anything to scoff at either. Fluid both during fighting scenes and... well, non-fighting scenes, some good animations really help a lot in the portrayal of characters and their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening/ending scenes, there isn\u2019t all too much I can say. The opening really shines at portraying that \u201cadvertised\u201d feeling of \u201cthis is a happy show about cute girls\u201d that the creators wanted to convey. The ending sequence however, is more or less just a silhouette of the main character walking away to music... \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the musical score first. The opening theme, \u201cConnect\u201d by ClariS, is quite a happy song, and just like its accompanying opening sequence it does a great job of portraying that aforementioned \u201chappy\u201d feeling. Now, previously when I talked about the ending sequence, I was more or less referring only to that in which Kalafina\u2019s \u201cMagia\u201d play, as this is the most \u201cprominent\u201d or well known of the 4 ending songs. The other 3 consist of the opening theme, \u201cConnect\u201d, a rather sad song called \u201cMata Ashita\u201d by Aoi Yuuki, and finally a not so sad, but not really happy song called \u201cAnd I\u2019m home\u201d, by Ai Nonaka and Eri Kitamura. \\n\r\n\u201cMagia\u201d however, receives quite a bit more credit because not only is it played in 7 of the 12 episodes, but it\u2019s also the most outstanding of the songs. Aside from being the ending theme of the series, it\u2019s also used quite frequently during some of the more \u201cepic\u201d moments of the series, such as fighting scenes, and it really helps bring out the feelings of certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of background music, Madoka\u2605Magica features quite an amazing soundtrack. It\u2019s overall pretty varied, ranging from happy themes such as \u201cCredens Justitiam\u201d, to darker songs such as \u201cWalpurgis Nux\u201d, there\u2019s always a song which fits the situation, and really helps in conveying the feelings which want to be conveyed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nMadoka\u2605Magica consists of a rather small cast of characters, but interesting ones nonetheless. The characters all felt very real to me, and the amount of character development in this series is just great. It makes the characters feel even more \u201calive\u201d, and really helps you relate and connect with them. The characters all (mostly) have solid and interesting backstories, however I feel like the reason this part is only a 9, is simply because of the fact that a certain character didn\u2019t have as much backstory or information about her which I felt like she should have (but who knows, maybe that\u2019ll change in the last movie).\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t too much more I can say here, without spoiling anything, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10 / 10)\\n\r\nThis is easily a 10/10 for me. I was lucky enough to not have anything really told to me about this show more than maybe \u201cit\u2019s a bit dark\u201d, or \u201cit\u2019s pretty weird\u201d, so the shock factor and all were quite high for me. All the emotions, and the lingering feelings of this show really makes it an amazing #1 favorite of mine.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nNow, this is obviously not your regular \u201cmahou shoujo\u201d, nor is it intended for the regular audience of said genre, but rather for a more mature audience. If you\u2019re a fan of darker, slightly psychological shows, then I assure you you\u2019re gonna love this if you can ignore the slightly slow beginning.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Amazing plot, with lots of twists and drama.\\n\r\n+ Outstanding soundtrack.\\n\r\n+ Great art (as expected of Shaft).\\n\r\n+ Interesting, fleshed out characters.\\n\r\n+ Lots of heart wrenching / heartwarming moments.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Starts out fairly slow. \\n\r\n- Shock factor of certain parts may decrease if you\u2019ve read too much about the show.",

            "content": "In all honesty, I entered this series with optimistic skepticism, for as a general principle, I tend not to like highly rated anime.  Far too often, I see a story with a great concept that misses several key opportunities to expand the plot [Angel Beats], or perhaps one whose characters simply don't seem particularly real to me [Hanasaku Iroha--at least, the first 4 episodes I watched before subsequently dropping the series].  To say the least, I expected this to be one of the same kinds of anime.\r\nBoy, was I wrong.\r\nMost reading this will know the story.  Reading other reviews will reveal thatthis is an anime that makes one think it will turn out one way, only to violently and, sometimes, unexpectedly switch gears.  Since that has been hashed out so much, I'll skip that and cut straight to the ratings:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nBeginning (15 points):  14\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins fairly simply, introducing the general plotline in the first few episodes.  As the characters are introduced, their personalities are very slowly (sometimes painstakingly so) revealed as to show their hidden motives and interests, which piqued my interest early on.  Curiously, characters' pasts are not well-documented here, unlike in some of the manga and even the PSP game that exists now.  My only criticism of the introduction is that Mami and Madoka, the main focus of this arc, could have benefited from even a few more minutes of delving into their past and/or present lives, but even in omitting that information, the viewer still has plenty of information to understand the characters.  Even still, this is enough of a flaw to deny the beginning a perfect 15.  The beginning was sufficient in explaining the beginning of the character development, and it amazed me in how it very efficiently shifted the plot into the middle of the story and on into the climax--every single scene had a purpose that became crystal clear as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nClimax (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues, throwing plot twist after plot twist at the viewer.  Not only are they true to their name in that many of them are simply unexpected, but they also have amazing cohesion into further developing the characters.  Not only that, in the transition from the beginning to middle, I found the emotion on display during each episode to be so strikingly real, that my emotions matched each character's own feelings with disturbing consistency.  In no other anime has my empathy been that strong and consistent with the characters.  It's common to feel bad for the characters, but it's much more difficult to give a viewer that level of empathy.  As much as I try to think of a flaw for this section, none comes to mind.  As a result, the climax gets a perfect 15.\\n\\n\r\nEnding (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nAt some points, I got a little misty-eyed towards the end of the climax section.  In the end, I was holding back tears through most of it.  The level of emotion easily eclipses that of the climax, making it very hard to keep a straight face, much less outright sobbing (Clannad After Story, anyone?).  At first, I honestly didn't like how the very last episode worked, but as I looked into it through reading other reviews among other things, I realized that I simply didn't understand it, and then it really grew on me.  I then concluded that there was no other ending I would have liked more than that one--for the dark nature of the anime, it really was a perfect ending in that it wasn't your stereotypical \"Happy ending\".  It had a giant asterisk.  What it was, well...you'll have to find out ;)  Combining the emotional appeal of the episodes leading up to the final one as well as the conclusion of the last episode itself, I would have to say that the ending also earns a perfect score.  If you are easily touched by happy or sad scenes, bring a hankie.  You'll need it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Quality and Development (20 points): 19\\n\\n\r\nI'm really trying to find flaws here.  In my opinion, it's damn near impossible.  EVERY character has a 3-dimensional personality, and there wasn't a single main character who didn't seem real, human, and likeable, within reason.  The weakest link of all the characters is really Madoka, but even her personality is realistic.  The ONLY flaw I can think of is the lack of history in two of the five main characters (even the Pokemon reject Kyuubey gets his own development) that I mentioned in the \"Beginning\" section of the story review.  One point lost for lost potential, but other than that, any criticism is really just splitting hairs.\\n\\n\r\nArt (15 points): 15\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is pretty good stuff.  As you progress through the story, the witch world art is absolutely surreal--the term I used to describe it after my first night watching was \"Alice in Wonderland-meets-LSD hallucination\".  It was so good, and even haunting, that I had a dream where my surroundings were witch world-esque.  The art was creepy at first, but it  grows on you.  I really liked it.  Perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10 points): 10\\n\\n\r\nReally hard to argue with the sound.  SFX were as creepy as the art.  BGM was probably a little thinner than most, but so many scores stuck with you.  Stuff I hadn't heard in a week, I still remembered.  The rest made it on my iPod.  Really hard to criticize a soundtrack that you're listening to in your spare time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10 points): 10\\n\\n\r\nI never thought I'd watch an anime that I would like better than Clannad.  Till now.  Though it's close, this has to be my new favorite anime, and I doubt that will change anytime soon.  I spent several rewatches staying up until the wee hours of the morning simply because I couldn't put the series down long enough to go to sleep.  With that kind of obsession with Madoka Magica, I can't give it anything other than a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTally that up, and the final score for the series is a whopping 98/100, good enough for an easy MAL score of 10.  Outrageous as it sounds, I've never had an anime that made me laugh, cry, and spend sleepless nights awake in a mixture of shock and horror as much as this one.  I truly enjoyed it fully, and if Kyuubey were real, I'd contract with him to let me watch this over and over again for the first time every time.",

It touches on all the usual tropes as if to prove it's a magical girl anime like any other but then it goes and departs from all of that and gives us something new and unique. The story keeps you yearning for that next episode. As of episode 9 it hasn't lost steam.\r\nThis is an adult-targeted magical girl show. It's dark, heavy-hitting, suspenseful and the battles with witches are glorious and ridiculous. I'd go so far as to call it Magical Girlin' Lagann. It's even lackingin nude transformations (not counting the opening) and other fanservice of underage girls, so you can watch it around people who aren't anime fans without feeling ashamed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've never enjoyed a magical girl anime before then this could easily be the first. If you like more pure magical girls, maybe look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is a story of Hope, Friendship, Despair, Evil Fluffy Magical Creatures, Cotton Balls with Moustaches and Parasailing Men in Orange Jumpsuits.It's also the best damn anime Japan has put out in a rather long time.\r\nI hes\u00adit\u00adate to use the word \u2018sub\u00adver\u00adsion\u2019 when describ\u00ading Madoka Magica, as it\u2019s a word thrown around by many, not under\u00adstand\u00ading what it is Madoka is sub\u00advert\u00ading in the first place. What I see is a group of girls, who oth\u00ader\u00adwise would spend their time eat\u00ading cake, being cute and gen\u00ader\u00adally being insuf\u00adfer\u00adably nice to each other, hav\u00ading great powers given to them and then made to suf\u00adfer becauseof it. This power is that of hav\u00ading their wish gran\u00adted in exchange for being a magical girl, some\u00adthing other magical girl anime, and anime stor\u00adies in gen\u00aderal, paint as being a glor\u00adi\u00adous thing. How\u00adever in Madoka Magica, this wish and power bring each char\u00adac\u00adter noth\u00ading but des\u00adpair. Not only do their lives effect\u00adively end because they became magical girls and suf\u00adfer in the gruelling battles against the witches, their wishes that are meant to be an equi\u00adval\u00adent trade off bring them noth\u00ading but more mis\u00adfor\u00adtune as well.\\n\\n\r\nSub\u00adver\u00adsion or not, the main appeal of Madoka Magica is what a per\u00adfectly told story it is. There\u2019s a very delib\u00ader\u00adate and clear path behind each character\u2019s devel\u00adop\u00adment. I found Kaname Madoka\u2019s devel\u00adop\u00adment the most fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading, espe\u00adcially in con\u00adtrast with what she could have been. Because of her own wimp\u00adi\u00adness and not becom\u00ading a magical girl, she keeps draw\u00ading more and more into her\u00adself, get\u00adting increas\u00adingly depressed with everything that hap\u00adpens to the girls around her. Shaft\u2019s anim\u00ada\u00adtion, often one that is more gimicky than use\u00adful, add hugely to the story-telling here. The altern\u00adate dimen\u00adsions of the witches are fright\u00aden\u00ading and bizarre places. The back\u00adgrounds have become increas\u00adingly dreary as the series goes on, mim\u00adick\u00ading the change in tone and depres\u00adsion of Madoka. Also spe\u00adcial credit has to be given for the way they frame Kyubey.\\n\\n\r\nKyubey is mag\u00adni\u00adfi\u00adcent. In a show with a cast of rather for\u00adget\u00adtable char\u00adac\u00adters, if mem\u00ador\u00adable stor\u00adies, Kyubey stands out as the most fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading and deadly vil\u00adlain since Johan Liebert of Mon\u00adster. Again, full credit has to be given to Shaft\u2019s art\u00adwork and how they frame Kyubey. How his shad\u00adows cast over the girls, stand\u00ading on their shoulders or their win\u00addowsills, push\u00ading Madoka into becom\u00ading a magical girl her\u00adself. How they fre\u00adquently draw atten\u00adtion to his unmov\u00ading expres\u00adsion, one that doesn\u2019t change no mat\u00adter what latest cata\u00adstrophe these girls he per\u00adson\u00adally made magical girls face.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes him so chilling is how he simply doesn\u2019t under\u00adstand. What we and the char\u00adac\u00adters see as evil is at a level he can\u00adnot com\u00adpre\u00adhend. Kyubey isn\u2019t evil, and never was, which is pre\u00adcisely why he works so well. Pos\u00adsibly the best line in the anime came in his con\u00adver\u00adsa\u00adtion with Madoka and why he made them magical girls, say\u00ading \u201cif you feel like sac\u00adri\u00adfi\u00adcing your\u00adself for the uni\u00adverse, give me a call\u201d. The heat death of the uni\u00adverse is so far bey\u00adond any\u00adthing Madoka her\u00adself can com\u00adpre\u00adhend or care about, entropy not hav\u00ading any effect for a bizz\u00adlion odd years, but equally Kyubey can\u2019t under\u00adstand why his actions cause the girls to hate him so much.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some prob\u00adlems with Madoka Magica though. Well, one spe\u00adcific prob\u00adlem. The char\u00adac\u00adters are dull. Their stor\u00adies are fas\u00adcin\u00adat\u00ading, cer\u00adtainly. I\u2019ve got\u00adten pretty emo\u00adtion\u00adally inves\u00adted in the wimpy\u00adness of Madoka and Homerun-chan the time trav\u00adel\u00adling les\u00adbian, but as people they simply don\u2019t have much per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adity. Without Kyubey, this would just be yet another anime about a bunch of incred\u00adibly dull girls being insuf\u00adfer\u00adably nice to each other, except with some occa\u00adsion\u00adally nice visu\u00adals. Well, not all nice visu\u00adals. I\u2019m rather par\u00adtial to the square-head design of the char\u00adac\u00adters, but their facial fea\u00adtures go rather array when the shot of it is any\u00adthing other than a close-up.\\n\\n\r\nOver\u00adall though, Madoka Magica is pretty fant\u00adastic anime. It\u2019s per\u00adfectly con\u00adstruc\u00adted and very delib\u00ader\u00adately paced, keep\u00ading enough rev\u00adel\u00ada\u00adtions with each epis\u00adode to keep it riv\u00adet\u00ading while keep\u00ading to the themes of the story without des\u00adcend\u00ading into shock tac\u00adtics for the sake of keep\u00ading out interest. They had to keep the twists com\u00ading, oth\u00ader\u00adwise the story would flounder when stuck with these bor\u00ading char\u00adac\u00adters, but it hasn\u2019t done that once over the course of the show. Well, per\u00adhaps bar the first two epis\u00adodes, but the speed at which it upped the ante after set\u00adting the scene means I\u2019m will\u00ading to for\u00adgive the show for that.Heck, they even somehow managed to piece together an acceptable ending that fit the plot and themes of the story, something I really was not expecting.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Madoka Magica is a bloody fantastic anime. It's not perfect, but damn is it ever entertaining. Highly recommended, perhaps not for a first-timer to the world of anime, but certainly for one who thinks anime hasn't been able to buy an original idea for years.\\n",

            "content": "You know, I really can't stand it when an anime gets a lot of hype. Not only is most of the hype unnecessary and coming from crazed otaku's, but half the time that leads me to having high expectations and I'm almost always let down. Not to mention overhyped anime is usually the type to attract the harshest of critics and haters, ready to bash on it. So when I first started \"Madoka Magica,\" I was pretty much ready to be annoyed by the so-called \"dark themes\" and went into it with the idea that it was just another anime that can appeal to everyone.\r\nLet'sjust say that it deconstructed that whole idea just as well as it did the magical girl genre. \\n\\n\r\nBy now you probably know that \"Madoka Magica\" starts off just as any other magical girl anime, but then twists into something darker. You should know that the plot of this anime is a very complex thing and does indeed steer off into a darker corner then most magical girl animes. While \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the first mahou shoujo to have dark themes in it, it's shocking twists and turns are what make it so popular and praised, and it deserves a lot of it. The story's true nature is written out and presented in ways that can captivate you. It takes things you thought were true, characters you thought you knew, and is able to change them right before your eyes into something that fits the story's underlying dark side. \\n\\n\r\nSo \"Madoka Magica\" has a deeply rooted story with lots of sick changes to it's genre and therefore it's story is perfect. Well no. Actually one of the biggest faults in the story is the use of these twists and turns themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTwo words. Shock value. When a viewer sees something shocking, they'll probably start thinking, \"Wow! This got so cool!\" and the shock value therefore makes the story seem better. \"Madoka Magica\" is guilty of doing this a number of times. It's an easy thing that some viewers may catch onto quickly and could lower your overall viewpoint of the show. \"If the story didn't shock you so much, would it still be good?\" That's a question that \"Madoka Magica\" brings up, and the answer varies on your own ideas and opinions of it's plot, which I personally think would still be worth it's praise even if we knew from the start it would be a dark mahou shoujo. However it's still worth noting that the shock value, for the most part, has a purpose that helps keep the plot moving forward instead of just being there to keep you interested in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the plot moves forward VERY fast. With 12 episodes, the show is paced at a very high speed. The story basically takes you and dives you at top speed into everything, which is exactly why you don't even need the shock value to keep you wanting more. Things happen quickly which will probably excite you and make you want to keep going. Overall, the story is a much darker and deeper tale for it's genre, and is able to make up (but not cover up) its flaws with everything that it leads into and presents. \\n\\n\r\nThe fast pacing leads into one big problem though, and that's with the characters. The characters more or less fill in typical stereotypes to further the deconstruction of magical girls, but with the show moving at such a high speed aren't given much time for proper development - and in some cases not enough time to grow attached to you - which leads to some of them looking a bit flat. The lack of development in Madoka, our main girl, is one of the more irritating things that can easily get to you as the show progresses. Most of the development was used on the story, mind you - so in return for less character development we get a higher quality story. Despite all of this, the fact that these character types are thrown into this type of situation makes them and their actions far more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the fast pacing, the characters may change a bit too quickly for one's liking, but in the end their changes reflect the very thing that triggered it all very nicely. Basically, the development that does occur matches the girl's current state in this deconstruction which is a plus. All the girls are capable of being likeable (Stereotypes? Likeable!? Yes, it is possible.) which is another high point of the series, it just all depends on your own preferences. In total, the characters were portrayed and played out very well, but sadly lacked in a few things because of the 12 episode time frame.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the artwork; if you're familiar with the studio SHAFT, masterminds behind the animation in titles like \"Bakemonogatari\" and \"ef - a tale of memories\" then you probably know what to expect from the artwork. While the character designs are given a very cute, typical, moe look, it's the backgrounds and animation that bring up the score to a 10. The setting is one that matches a futuristic background, and the details used to bring this out are outstanding. The quality is extremely high, nearly meeting that of a movie's. The witch's labyrinth's gives off an ominous feeling - equal to the show's true nature as well and have such a unique design to them that can leave you staring in wonder. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to the art is the very \"cute\" designs given to the characters, not to mention since it seems SHAFT put their all into the fight scenes, witch's lairs, etc. the characters sometimes look disproportional or even unfitting in a scene. But hey, that was the goal, right? Remember; deconstruction. Still, everything else that this top-notch animation does right makes up for it without a doubt. Simply put - while character designs are a bit lackluster, everything else around them is animated and designed at such a high quality that it's natural to be left awestruck.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is done by Yuki Kajiura, and is like the artwork and animation - top-notch. The OST has some extremely memorable and emotional songs that are bound to grow attached to you. Kajiura's style matches perfectly with this anime's style, which just makes the soundtrack even more amazing. It's pretty diverse and I highly doubt you'll be able to forget about it, even if you end up hating this anime. The blend or orchestral sounds, chimes, all of it is done with such great, notable effort. \\n\\n\r\nAll the seiyuus fit their roles very well. As for dub/sub, I don't recommend the dub at all. While I'm not a dub bashed, it's simply not good and the voice actors just aren't able to match the characters nor live up to the original Japanese version.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Honestly, I didn't think I would enjoy this all that much. Like I said, series that are hyped up with deep stories usually come off flat to me. Not this show, though. No, \"Madoka Magica\" is not a complete masterpiece, nor is it flawless or the best thing you'll ever lay your eyes on. It had flaws just like any anime will, but these flaws are things that can be overlooked if you're able to see the positives and enjoy what \"Madoka Magica\" has to offer you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Madoka Magica\" isn't the most perfect anime ever and isn't something that everyone can watch and like, and for good reasons, too. But despite this, it's still possible for anyone to still enjoy and love this distorted take on the mahou shoujo genre for all the positives that it has to offer, just as long as you accept it's flaws, too. I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mahou shoujo, action, the ever-famous horror genre, and who's ready to take off on the twisted and more mingled road of magical girls. \\n\\n\r\nOverhyped? Yes, but with all the wonderful things that this show has to offer, I can understand why. Try it - it's one hell of a ride on the sinister side of mahou shoujo.",

            "content": "Of all the divisive figures in anime, very few can start flame wars like Gen Urobuchi. Most \"elite\" critics here on MAL and over on the bastion of sophisticated intellectuals that is 4chan, hate him and call him the Anti-Christ of anime. I personally find him extremely hit-or-miss. One thing Urobuchi has going for him is that like George RR Martin, he is a crusty old bastard that won't cave to fan demands and make a happy ending, sparing all of the fan favorite characters. When the viewer doesn't know who will live and who will die each week, it adds suspense and keeps thingsfrom getting boring and predictable. He also IS actually a competent writer that can create beloved characters and keep a steady tone with occasional bouts of witty and sophisticated dialogue. \"I have long since learned, as a measure of elementary hygiene, to be on guard when anyone quotes Pascal.\" The Achilles heel of Urobuchi is that the man doesn't have a creative bone in his body. ALL he does is rip off other authors, and he barely even tries to disguise it. Sometimes he doesn't even disguise it and explicitly mentions it, like Psycho Pass with the works of Philip K. Dick, notably Minority Report, a copy of which appears prominently in the background of one episode on a bookshelf! This generally means that the quality of the Urobuchi anime is directly dependent on what he is ripping off and if that work lends itself to easy adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSo if Aldnoah Zero is a shitty Gundam ripoff and Psycho Pass is a surprisingly great adaptation of Philip K Dick's Minority Report, what is Madoka Magica ripping off? Mostly NGE actually. \"WHAT!? Those 2 series are nothing alike! This reviewer must be on crack!\" Allow me to explain what I mean. In the second half of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Anno decided to make it more of a psychoanalysis project, but during the first half, EVA was supposed to serve as a complete deconstruction of the \"teens pilot giant robots\" Mecha genre. A \"deconstruction\" , at least the way the term is used in conversation online, is when you break down a genre by identifying all the cheesy tropes and cliches, and turn them all around into something new. More often than not, this creates a dark new twist on the genre that basically shows what would happen if that genre happened in real life. For example, during the Gold and Silver Ages of American comics, costumed heroes received immense powers and never let that power corrupt them or isolate them from the rest of humanity. They fought crime without wanting anything in return, delivered cheesy one liners, and helped citizens basically all day out of the goodness of their hearts. This of course sounds completely bullshit and totally opposite of the dark reality that we all know and live in. In response, Alan Moore decided to create Watchmen to absolutely demolish American costume hero comics and show what would actually happen. The government uses super heroes to win wars by slaughtering millions of people, heroes develop God complexes, or are greedy, or are violent sociopaths. All of the cliches are turned upside down and all the bullshit assumptions of the genre were shattered. Neon Genesis Evangelion initially wished to do the same thing to the mecha genre and show why emotionally fragile teenagers suffering the angst that all teenagers naturally feel, would actually be HORRIBLE candidates to pilot giant robots and save the world from monsters. Madoka tries to be complete deconstruction of the \"magical girl\" genre of anime, which if that sounds like a stupid idea, it's because it honestly kind of is.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: Some Spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nSo what does a genre deconstruction of \"magical girl\" anime look like? Exactly what you think it would look like. Little moe girls receive magical powers, but this time those powers always come at a tragic cost and everything is extremely grim and depressing. I won't spoil too much of the plot, but basically magical girls have to give up their souls in order to get their powers and spend their days fighting monsters that they will eventually turn into once they become too tainted. \u201cBeware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.\u201d-Nietzsche in his book \"Beyond Good and Evil\". \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this WOULD have been a decent idea, if EVERYONE hadn't already done it before! Claymore did this back in the early 2000s! Berserk has dealt with this topic. Hellsing has dealt with this topic. Not only has everyone done it, but a LOT have done it better than Madoka did! As for the whole \"brilliant deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre, the freaking magical girl genre has ALWAYS been firmly tongue in cheek, so making a Sailor Moon version of Watchmen wasn't really warranted, it wasn't clever, it doesn't deserve heaps of praise! This anime is quite decent on a technical level with animation, voice acting, music, but I feel it is an insanely overrated series that didn't really even need to exist! EVERYTHING that this anime does and receives praise for, has already been done FAR better by loads of other series. Madoka isn't actually a bad anime, but it is NOT a freaking masterpiece that needs an 8.6 out of 10. If Watchmen in terms of quality as a groundbreaking deconstruction is on the 100th floor and Eva is on the 80th floor, Madoka Magica is somewhere around sub-basement 3. Madoka is basically a mediocre anime that receives absurd amounts of praise from noobs, who have no idea what a genre deconstruction is and think Madoka is groundbreaking and brilliant, when it actually isn't. In summary, FUCK this series! Although I DO love the pun that people keep shouting online: Rusev Madoka, Rusev Magica! It is rather rare to see Bulgarian/Japanese language puns. I guess if I had to pick the most positive thing Madoka contributed, it would be that.",

            "content": "I want to start this review off by stating that I absolutely loved this anime. Very few anime manage to capture my attention enough to compel me to spend time reading wikis and even going as far as doing research. In fact, I loved Madoka so much that I watched it twice within a week, mainly to see if I could pick up on any details that I missed during my first watching. I was particularly interested in all the supposed references and parallels to Goethe's works (namely, Faust), but as I am unfamiliar with German literature, I honestly couldn't discern much. But, I digress.As difficult as it may be, I try to be as objective as possible with my ratings. This task is particularly difficult to accomplish with Madoka, as I would love with all my heart to say that it is an unparalleled masterpiece. But it simply isn't. And I will try my best to explain why.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I'm a fan of or that I've had much experience with the magical girl genre of anime. I've watched Sailor Moon, and that's about the extent of my exposure to this particular genre. Therefore, I feel unqualified to talk about genre clich\u00e9s and whatnot, so I won't say anything like, \"Madoka Magica redefined the magical girl genre with its twisted and dark plot\" or \"Madoka Magica is a refreshing break from the classic cheerful magical girl animes\".  \\n\\n\r\nFrom a completely objective standpoint, Madoka had a compelling and intriguing plot.  It starts off not unlike the typical magical girl anime (or so I would presume): we are introduced to the protagonist Madoka Kaname and her friends Sayaka Miki and Hitomi Shizuki in a typical middle/high school environment. The mascot character of the series, Kyuubey, appears shortly and offers to grant Madoka and Sayaka any wish under the condition that they become magical girls and dedicate their lives to fighting malicious beings called witches which, apparently, are the cause for many unexplained accidents and suicides. Sounds like a simple and innocent proposition, doesn't it? But, obviously, there's more to it that. The story, in short, follows Madoka as she gradually learns of the hardships and suffering that befalls all the girls who choose to accept Kyuubey's offer, and truth behind the witches and the seemingly good-natured concept of wish-granting.    \\n\\n\r\nThe plot definitely introduces one of the more creative concepts I've encountered in my history of watching anime. To be frank, I can guarantee that you will never be bored at any point during the series. The action is fast-paced, the drama is effective but never overdone, and the shock value alone is enough to keep you at the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does Madoka fail to live up to my expectations?  \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues I have with the series is its choice of Madoka as the central character.  Simply put, she just doesn't have what it takes to be an effective protagonist. Remember what I said about her being thrown into a situation where she is forced to cope with the consequences of becoming a magical girl? In a sense, I lied. She is never really faced with that situation, because she is always on the sidelines, watching the action unfold around her. It is due to this reason that we simply cannot sympathize with her and her story in the same way that would if she had played a more important role. It's difficult for the audience to feel like they are part of the show because, frankly speaking, Madoka isn't part of the show. It honestly feels as if she could be demoted to the role of the narrator, and it wouldn't make a difference as far as the unfolding of the events is concerned. Until, of course, the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of the last episode, I must admit that I was thoroughly confused throughout the majority of it. Those of you who have seen the anime will probably know what I mean. I also can't say that I enjoyed the way the series ended. It was, by all means, a satisfactory resolution to a series for which I had difficulty predicting an ending, but, in hindsight, it came across as borderline absurd. Madoka's sudden and drastic change of personality was not in the least bit convincing, and, as bittersweet as the conclusion was, I had a hard time believing that a middle school-aged girl could muster up the courage to show such a huge sense of responsibility and selflessness.  \\n\\n\r\nI would honestly like to discuss some of the plotholes that cause the believability factor of the series to waver, but doing so would inevitable lead to some major spoilers. I suppose some of them are minor enough to the point that they can be overlooked, but as a highly critical person, I found them difficult to ignore. Hopefully, those of you who have watched or are planning to watch the anime will be able to set these flaws aside and not let them affect your enjoyment of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to rate the art of the series on character design alone, I wouldn't be able to give Madoka more than a 5. I simply did not like the way the characters looked. I've heard that the characters look much better in the manga, and apparently not even the animation in the anime did the manga justice. The series has often been criticized for reusing the same bland appearance for all five of its magical girl characters, and this criticism is justified. But it becomes pretty obvious when the witches show up that the characters weren't the major focus of the animation team. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that came into my mind during the first witch fight was that the animation must have been inspired by LSD-induced hallucinations. Although that opinion never really changed throughout the series, I grew to appreciate the witch sequences so much that I was more excited to see the design of a witch's lair than the battle against the witch herself. The sequences feature some of the best examples of surrealist imagery I have ever seen. I guess it's to be expected of a studio that produces art-driven anime like SHAFT. In addition, I love how many elements of a witch's past are (presumably) incorporated into the design of her lair as well, undoubtedly leading to fan speculation on the histories of the many witches featured in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very fluid and the fight sequences are crisp and well-choreographed. I don't really have any comments or complaints about the non witch lair environments either, although the fact that all the buildings seem to made out of glass really stands out. It gives you the impression that the story is set in a futuristic world. Overall, the series is visually attractive, if one can overlook the mishaps in character design.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, the soundtrack is flawless. The background music never once fails to enhance the atmosphere and manages to evoke a wide array of emotions. You know that you've found an amazing soundtrack when you can enjoy listening to it without the visuals presented in the animation. My personal favourite is Sayaka's Miki theme; although it seems like a joyful song on the surface, a melancholic undertone can be detected upon careful listening. Homura Akemi's theme stands as well, because it is quite representative of her character - cold, mysterious, and spine-chilling.   \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, Connect, is a pretty generic J-pop song, suitable for any magical girl anime. The cheerful opening also presents you with images of Madoka engaged in typical magical girl activities, lulling you into a \"false sense of security\". The ending theme is much more consistent with the atmosphere of the series, and I think the decision to not use it until the third episode was justified. Although unrelated to sound, I must also mention that both themes change visually as the story progresses. I won't discuss all the details, but one of the more interesting changes is that the ending becomes darker and darker every episode, reflecting the gradual descent of the characters into despair.    \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus did a great job on the voice acting, and I honestly can't say I have any complaints sub-wise. I particularly loved Kato Emiri's convincing performance as Kyuubey, as her voice remained consistent with his emotionless character throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved most of the main characters of the show, especially Homura, from a subjective point of view, it's hard to ignore the fact that the series has some problems in this department. \\n\\n\r\nI have already discussed Madoka's failure as a protagonist in the story section of the review. In addition to this unforgivable \"identity crisis\", it would be an understatement to say that Madoka is one of the least interesting main characters in anime history. There honestly isn't much to her other than the fact that she's your average middle school girl faced with a not-so-average dilemma. Why the writers decided to centre the entire story around her is honestly completely beyond my comprehension. She does, however, change in the last two episodes and develops an independent mindset and sense of justice. Unfortunately, this drastic change in personality is all too sudden and happens too late in the series to rectify her initial shallowness. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum is the mysterious Homura Akemi. She's enigmatic, seemingly emotionless, and doesn't say or do much for the majority of episodes apart from the repetitive \"do not become a magical girl\" warnings to Madoka and occasional deus ex machina. We do find out later why she has developed into the type of person that she is, justifying most, if not all, of her actions.  However, it's honestly difficult to feel sympathy for her because her personality is introduced too late in the series in the span of a single episode. Forgive me for speaking the truth, Homuhomu-chan. I still love you, though.\\n\\n\r\nMy feelings towards the tomboyish Sayaka are mostly positive. I loved how her descent into hopelessness and despair was portrayed in such a relentless manner. I did feel sympathy for her because, unlike Madoka, she had a strong sense of justice from the start, but her childish naivet\u00e9 led to her eventual downfall. The subplot with Kyosuke, although extremely generic, was also a welcome addition to the series, as it shed light onto her character and motivations and showed the extent to which she was affected upon learning about the 'fine print' of the magical girl contract.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I found that Kyouko had the most interesting personality out of the five magical girls. She's cynical, selfish, hotheaded, and even reveals her sadistic side to Sayaka. Not exactly the formula for a likeable character, is it? However, when the story eventually sheds some light on her past, you begin to understand why she acts the way she does and she becomes even more interesting. It's quite regrettable that she is a major player in so few episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for Mami, there isn't much to say about her, and it isn't exactly her fault. She has a motherly and optimistic character and introduces Madoka and Sayaka to the world of magical girls, but doesn't play a major role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, a couple of words on Kyuubey. He doesn't have much of a personality, and once again, it's not his fault. He initially seems good-natured and innocent, but you soon realize that this isn't the case. It isn't difficult to guess that his intentions are not pure and his manipulative side suggests that he has ulterior motives.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the biggest problem of the series is that the seemingly less important characters contribute much more to the enjoyability of the story  than those who are essentially forced into the spotlight without much depth to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this one more time. I love Madoka Magica and I enjoyed every second of it. And that's why this review was so difficult for me to write. I wanted to present to the community a completely unbiased view on an anime that has been constantly revered as \"the best anime of 2011\" and even \"one of the best animes of all time\". The verdict? It simply does not deserve the amount of praise it gets.  \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. I would definitely recommend Madoka to anyone without a second thought. Don't let this review change your mind about watching Madoka. After all, it isn't fair to judge an anime based on the opinions of another person. At the end of the day, I guess all that matters is whether or not you enjoy the anime personally. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the most deceptive works I have ever laid my eyes on, and that is why it is amazing. From the very start, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" appears to be pretty much what you would expect from your typical magical girl anime. The only difference being of course, the seemingly out of place art style that you would attribute to it being a SHAFT production. This is of course what the show wants you to think, as it prepares to take your expectations and slap you in the face with them. Suddenly, the Salvador Dali style of animation doesn't seem that outof place anymore, and that is when you realize you are watching something special.\\n\\n\r\nIn this review I am going to limit myself to what I consider to be the two most interesting aspects of this show. The writing, and the art. The review contains moderate amounts of spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nWRITING:\\n\\n\r\nThis was the first of Gen Urobuchi's works that I had the privilege to experience and I have since watching it, sought after anything else that he has been involved in. His name only, has become enough for me to check out a work, be it anime, book, or visual novel. He has a very peculiar, unorthodox style of writing. It isn't by any means flawless and I am sure that a lot of people would find it off-putting, but when it works, it is golden. Urobuchi's writing is all about deception through the clever use of turning-points and unexpected, yet logical developments.\\n\\n\r\nIf \"Madoka\" was a conventional story, it would use the first few episodes to establish a premise (magical girl anime), follow it up by introducing some sort of main direction for the story (defeat bad guys, save people, etc), introduce an eventual villain, end it with a climactic battle, and perhaps wrap it up with an epilogue of some sort.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, the premise for the beginning of the story is dropped almost immediately, only for the story to head in several completely different directions that are in a similar fashion dropped along the way, either because they were only there to decieve you in the first place, or because they only serve as a foundation for what is to come. The true nature of the story isn't established until it is a bit over half way through. Homura's story is only told right before they are about to head towards the show's climax. To put it simply, if at the start of the show, you think Madoka will become a magical girl by the end of the first or second episode, you will have to guess again... and again... and again... and again... and by the time you have given up playing guessing games, you will find yourself unexpectedly in love with a story that you never would have guessed was coming.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no real villain as \"Walpurgisnacht\" is treated more as an apocalyptic weapon than as an actual character, and \"Kyubee\" though he may technically be the source of all the destruction, he isn't by any means acting out the role of an antagonist. In the same sense, Madoka isn't exactly the kind of protagonist you would find in a magical girl show. She is powerless, afraid, unstable, and generally helpless to the horrors that surrounds her. Homura on the other hand, is where the heart of the show lies. Her actions, her efforts, her beginning, middle, and end, are the most defining aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are expecting a more conventional story, this kind of writing might rub you the wrong way, but for me, it was amazing. At the end of the show when I think back on what I have just watched, it amazes me how much it contrasts in where it starts, where it goes, and where it ends up. It really feels like a journey, and it leaves me breathless, staring up at the ceiling in silent awe. Of course, you can never achieve the same experience on a second viewing as you are already prepared for everything beforehand, but that first time you watch it is an experience unlike any other.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is absolutely beautiful. If you took away all of what I have already mentioned above, leaving only the art and preferably the music, I would have still loved it. As a big sucker for deranged animation and surrealist art styles, \"Madoka\" is right up my alley, reminding me of works such as Mamoru Oshii's \"Angel's Egg\", Tatsuo Sato's \"Cat Soup\", and even of German expressionism from the 1920's such as \"The cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", or \"Metropolis\". The art itself is very imaginative and vivid. My favourite part is the scene that is done completely in silhouettes.\\n\\n\r\nMy best recommendation is to watch the enhanced bluray version that even goes back and adds extra changes in the animation throughout the series, creating an even stronger effect, and making the experience all the more complete.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, just like the story, the real beauty of the animation isn't the art itself, but how it is used. The surreal mode only kicks in when there is a witch nearby, meaning all other scenes are drawn in a relatively normal style of animation. Most notable are the character designs. The characters were all designed by Ume Aoki, author of Hidamari Sketch, who was never told what the show was about. She actually thought she was designing characters for a regular magical girl anime. Thus we have the perfect illusion of an innocent, saccharine, moe, girly looking show for when the art style is in normal mode. More importantly though, it also makes for an amazing contrast when the setting suddenly changes into surreal mode, and the cuteness of the characters make it all the more jarring when seeing the horrible environment that surrounds them. In fact, combining cuteness with horror seems to be a running theme in all aspects of this show, be it art, story, characters, music, etc. Combining opposites in a fictional work is somewhat of a risk but \"Madoka\" manages it exceptionally well, creating something rather unique.\\n\\n\r\nThere is much more to discuss about \"Madoka\". The Faustian themes of the story, the cosmic horror aspect, the deconstruction aspect (as well as the reconstruction aspect), the amazing soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura, the characters, the production, the story itself, etc. A single review simply cannot bring it justice, as even this one that barely scratches the surface has already dragged on for too long. As for concluding words, \"Puella Magi Madoka Magica\" is an experience that you cannot afford to miss. The story is rich, it is provocative in more ways than one, it is unique, it looks great, it sounds great, it is a must see.",

            "content": "I'll be perfectly honest and upfront about that the fact that I'm very new to the world of anime and manga, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is officially the first anime series that I've completed from start to finish.  \r\nI had no expectations really when I chose it from a list on Netflix, and had no idea of its popularity or anything.  I simply thought the characters looked cute and the description sounded fun.  Boy, was I in for a surprise!\r\n\u273f~ Story ~\u273f\r\nSimply fantastic!  The story is much darker and deeper than I could have ever imagined, with twists and surprises thrownin throughout.  And it consistently grabbed my attention and left me wanting more at the end of each episode, dying to find out what happens next.  Who knew that a story about magical girls and witches could be so complex and emotional?  10/10\\n\\n\r\n\u273f~ Art ~\u273f\\n\\n\r\nThis category is probably my only real issue with Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, and it's not even that bad.  There's just a certain art/animation style when it comes to the witches and their strange labyrinths that I didn't entirely care for.  It was too weird and trippy for me, and would have rather had those scenes match the artwork and animation of the rest of the anime, which was very beautiful and nicely done!  Still, I have to admit that the weirdness of the witch and labyrinth scenes did fit with the mood of the story.  8/10\\n\\n\r\n\u273f~ Sound ~\u273f\\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I didn't notice the music very often during the episodes, but when I did, it was some amazing stuff! But that's one magical quality about music: there comes a point where you no longer hear the music... you feel it.  And when the story gets so powerful and emotional, and the music is equally powerful and emotional, it's a beautiful thing.  The intro song \"Connect\" and main credits theme \"Magia\" are especially good as well, and I'd often listen to them through instead of skipping past them.  9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u273f~ Characters ~\u273f\\n\\n\r\nI can't speak for anyone else, but my \"favorite character\" switched between each and every main character at some point throughout the anime!  They all have something special about them and have so much to give to the story, and I became deeply attached to them all in turn, which made for quite the emotional rollercoaster!  Any book or movie or show that can make me so emotionally invested in its characters definitely did it's job right!  10/10\\n\\n\r\n\u273f~ Enjoyment ~\u273f\\n\\n\r\nMy knee-jerk answer is that I most certainly enjoyed this anime!  But giving it some thought and thinking more critically, I have to admit that sometimes I did feel that it was progressing a little slow, or had some issues with certain aspects of the plot and character choices that I felt were unrealistic or just plain didn't make much sense to me, not to mention the wonky artstyle, etc.  So was it 100% perfect?  No, it wasn't, but far more often than not I was on the edge of my seat with my eyes glued to the screen!  And I will highly recommend this series to anyone who asks.  9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u273f~ Overall:  9/10 ~\u273f",

            "content": "[Open your mind cause the reviews are esoteric YO]\nAfter suffering another long absence and subsequently ameliorating my punctuation and grammar(go read my first few reviews), I decided I would spice things up a notch by reviewing a critically acclaimed and popular series from last year. The question is, has Puella Magi Madoka Magica managed to escape the turd train? Read\u2014OBEY!\u2014 and find out. That being said, without further ado, I now introduce the long awaited sequel to the perpetually incomplete reviewing saga that is Daimyo.\nStory 7/10\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica, is a seminal anime from the year 2011 directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and written by GenUrobuchi.\\n\\n\nIn order to gain a proper understanding of this anime, you must first understand the story. If possible I'd like to do without drawing out too many spoilers; but this storyline is such a bucket of shit, that if I don't at least attempt explain some of the finer details, you'll fuck up your galoshes as you tread through my review. Now I must profess, it has been quite some time since I completed this show, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in any of my accounts. Basically, what we have is a story about a bunch of fucking girls doing girly stuff. Drinking tea, designing costumes, discussing boys; or at least that's what the show wants you to believe in the beginning. You're quickly brought to reality \u2014as real as a show about a bunch of girls can get\u2014. We are soon led into a world of deceit, jealousy, paradox, paradox, paradox and more paradox. We're missing a key point here, though. Why is all of this happening? What if I told you, it's because there is some race of super advanced aliens granting little girl's eternal youth and the power to make 1 wish, just so they can feast on the power created by their happiness and misery, thereby, restoring balance to the universe and creating a thermal energy source for future generations to enjoy. Yea you'd probably tell me to stop smoking crack. Who came up with this shit? What ever the original intention of this show, I can confidently tell you that this show is more than hilarious. If you're the right kind of bastard, you'll laugh for days while you watch this. Which is even easier to do with the show's shabby visuals and balls on the wall animation\u20142011 and they still fucked things up\u2014. Seriously, whoever drew this show can't draw a straight line. Must have masturbated too much to the visuals or something. This is of course emphasized by the fact that almost everything on this show seems spontaneous; like literally they were pulling plot developments and twists out of a hat (Constanza). \\n\\n\nAll of this is kind of bearable, but there's one thing you just won't be able to stand. This is a 12 episode series, and I swear to Jehova they were talking for 5 fucking episodes straight. We don't give a fuck about tea parties, violin players, or any of your shitty lives. I just want to see you guys kill and beat the shit out of things. I mean some would call it character development, but in my opinion, it's more like degradation. Though a show like this does have it charms, it's limited by the fact that once again, it is just about a bunch of fucking little girls. These tough enough girl shows lose credibility. Like that Higurashi show, it's just a bunch of none sense. The only time you need to be afraid of a girl, is if she has a gun pointed at you, poisons your food, tries to kill you in your sleep or proposes to marry you. Actually, those are a lot of times to be afraid. Be very afraid of this show's plot, very afraid...\\n\\n\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\nThe show stars the titular character Madoka. Who is, without a doubt, the worst character in the whole series. I don't know of any other series that immediately comes to mind, where the main character gets away with doing almost nothing of importance but somehow has the whole series revolving around them.  The only way to describe Madoka, is as a nuisance that just won't go away. A pain in the ass that never heals, she's there right from episode 1 all the way to the end. There's just nothing to like about her: over optimistic, too damn kind for her own good, cheesy, nosey, you name it. She's everything you hate in a shoujo character cranked to 11.  What makes her even her even worse, is her neh neh neh voice. I mean all characters in this show are guilty of this. Then they have her played out like she's some sort of God. Because all the female characters are like Gods these days or something. If her name wasn't in the title of this show, she'd be completely un- necessary. \\n\\n\nNext up, Akemi Homura, who continues the trend of the quiet emo girl being the strongest. Hardcore dyke though, because behind that tough girl exterior, she can't live her life without Madoka. How this came to be? I don't even fucking know. Didn't make much sense to me even when they explained it.\\n\\n\nSayaka Miki, the next dumbass in this series. I think I established earlier, that when these Alien overlords come to steal your emotional resources, they offer you the chance to make 1 wish. This stupid bitch wishes for some guy who didn't even like her to get healed. You heard that right. This dumb fuck gets 1 free wish, could have been wealth, power, you fucking name it but no she blows it on a whim. That's like some female intelligence and logic right there. If she was going to go that route, why not wish for the power to heal people, then use it to heal him, then become some sort of doctor and use it to scam millions out of people. You know why she didn't think of this? Because all the characters in this show are over-emotional retards. She'd rather mope around and then watch as the man she wasted her wish on to heal and tended to everyday in the hospital, falls in love with someone else. \\n\\n\nMami Tomoe, is like this show's Kamina. But since this show is nothing like TTGL, she's completely full of shit. I mean she's like one of those soft spoken, know-it-all characters that sip tea and fuck knows else.\\n\\n\nKyoko Sakura, is the least obnoxious character on this show. Which really isn't saying much. Somehow, she ends up being the one I detest the least. That does not mean, I like her the best. She has a rough start, though. I mean they introduced her as the new selfish bitch, but unlike the other characters on this show, she actually progressed. \\n\\n\nKyubey is like some evil deranged version of some shitty mahou shojo luna/kerobero type character. He's a no good son of a bitch, is all you need to know. \\n\\n\nThe problem with most of the characters in this show, is that they all make me want to jump in and punch the shit out of them. Yea, yea, yea, I know they're GURLS. But seriously, wasting my motherfucking time like that, that's a low blow, bro. They're lucky anime budgets are so low these days,  that they could only afford 12 episodes. Imagine this steaming pile of donkey shit as a full blown out 26 episode series.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\nI enjoyed this show a lot more than I thought I would. Somewhere I must have missed out when they giving membership passes to this show, my little pony and other similar sensation shows. From reading this review, you can tell I enjoyed it for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\nMusic 5/10\\n\\n\nJust your usual generic j-pop. Nothing special here. No memorable themes even. Or so I'd like to say. I ended up giving this show a pass due to the first opening. Pretty good stuff. \"See You Tomorrow\" by Aoi; investigate. \\n\\n\nArt 3/10\\n\\n\nThey no can draw straight lines. Daimyo no can make sentences...\\n\\n\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\nOverall, you're just going to put this show in shit territory like Angel Beats. However, where I saw Angel Beats had the potential to be better, I just don't see how this show could get any better. That is, short of an alien invasion and all the characters getting killed. This show is a solid 5.5. While it's not always good to use my previous reviews as a scale \u2014seeing as I gave Hareluya II boy a 9 lol\u2014. To give you an idea on how I view it compared to other shows I've done, it's better than maken-ki but worst than angel beats. Thankfully, I had the privilege and opportunity to watch other shows from 2011, that I deem to be better, fate/zero and kaiji S2 , for example. So if you're still reading this review at this point, go watch those instead.",

            "content": "Ah yes, Madoka Magica. Upon request of another I am reviewing this show and believe when I say that I did not truly wish to do this because of two reasons. Firstly, I see no reason in reviewing shows that will receive exceptionally low scores as it only wastes my time and yours, plus make a lot of people angry at the same time. Secondly, the director of this series is someone I do not like either based on many of his other works in addition to this one, so it is not fun to talk about him. His name is Gen Urobutchi, sometimes calledthe \"Urobutcher\" due to the extremely harsh ways he kills his characters. Without further ado, make a wish and lets go:\\n\\n\r\n     Plot: The series uses the same one Sailor Moon did in order to start itself. A young and fairly naive girl discovers an animal that is not as it seems and through some means becomes a Mahou Shoujo (Magical Girl). Naturally she tells others and her friends become them as well. I am bound by spoiler-free style to not talk much about its overall plot to prevent ruining anyones experience. However, when a show has a plot this bad I feel their is very little to spoil, this is very true in light of the ep 3 death that nearly everyone knows about. Mami, a mentor of sorts dies from the attack of a demon (Called a witch) in ep 3 and from there the girls are left to fend for themselves with a magical animal named Kyubey \"helping\" them every step of the way. I also need to mention that Kyubey is the animal/entity that bestows these powers on the girls in the first place. Giving out wishes to girls in exchange for near slavery as Mahou Shoujo. The first plot hole we need to address is Kyubey itself. This \"thing\" is emotionless and claims to merely be following a prime directive to harvest the energy (fancier word used in show) for its alien planet. If Kyubey can grant these wishes for anything to the girls, why not take their energy by force? Why have a roundabout way of getting them to be Mahou Shoujo and waste time killing an infinite amount of Witches and a lot of crap when it could just take the energy and leave. Its because Urobutchi said so thats why. Next point is that one of the girls named Homura is actually a guardian for the main girl Madoka. For reasons that never had what I would consider sound reasoning she cannot tell Madoka to not become a Mahou Shoujo outright, and since Kyubey is likened to that of a god in power thus never dying she also cannot kill the instigator. It stands to reason that Homura's best option would clearly be to either kill Madoka to end her protection cycle (Oh yeah, Homura is stuck in a time loop protecting Madoka because terrible reset ending said so) or yelled it out to her at the several points she could of instead of being emo and stand-offish every chance she gets. Even reality would of had a collapse because of Madoka learning this it would still be preferable to the never-ending \"Groundhog Day\" scenario Homura finds herself in. I could go on through several more plot holes but these two illustrate my main point. Point being that the series ignores solutions to problems in order to create a false sense of danger despite it just being a reset ending so the danger isn't really there. 1/5 \\n\\n\r\n     Character Development: I am guessing that at some point Urobutchi decided to take a page from Evangelion and use its characters as pure symbolism. This is great in theory, but the problem is that in Evangelion they were Characters with a personality first and symbols second. This series' cast are all supposed to be symbols first and every once in a while some part of them develops. Madoka despite being the main character never develops, all we see is an alternate reality version of her where she is better but thats not development, thats just another version of her. The only girl worth mentioning for development here is the blue-haired girl named Sayaka and her friend who is a sickly boy in a hospital. Thanks to their interactions both develop and learn to cope with that situation in a great way. But of course a good male character with development need not stay long and once he is healed is kicked from the story, thankfully not in Urobutchi's favorite method of death, but is simply fazed out. Sayaka's development ends shortly there-after and everyone else either stays the same or has an alternate \"what-if\" version shown near the end. 2/5 for taking a small amount of time out to develop someone. 2/5\\n\\n\r\n     Sound: Finally, a good aspect of the series! I will not lie I loved all the dark music and the way it helped build tension and atmosphere. If the plot and characters were as fun and interesting as this music it'd be another story. Then again, the music had nothing to do with Urobutchi in terms of design, so it makes sense to me. The openings and endings are nicely done too. Not much t say here since it was all handled quite well. It'd be higher if it actually had a better variety aside from brooding sadness, but it does that very well thankfully. 3/5\\n\\n\r\n     Art: Its no secret to those who know me that grossly disproportioned moe (Cute for sake of being cute, big eyes small facial features with waxy feel) turns me off from a title. The good news is that \"Madoka Magica\"'s designs were handled by someone with no knowledge of the story and it resulted in nice concept art. While I am not fanatical about it, the backgrounds in the witch's realms and the girls' designs are not the worst I've seen (See K-On! for pure moe hell). It gets the job done but does not impress me. 2/5\\n\\n\r\n     Final Thoughts: If I owe my critical views of moe and Urobutchi to any show it is this one. Every type of trope modern anime has come to behold from reset endings (Thanks Key/Visual Arts), moe visuals (Wow K-On! \"nice\" job), and also flat characters (Thanks every boring battle shonen) Madoka has it all in one pretty bloody Urobutchered package. As I sign off from this review, I urge to remind the haters that these are my views and they do not need to match theirs, if you are a lover of Madoka thats fine (even if I honestly am saddened by that fact) and you should continue watching whatever interests you. I am here to merely give a harsher analysis with more detail and higher bars for media to live up to. Oh and one last note, you gotta love how the name of the studio that made this is called Studio Shaft, Urobutchi sure loves to give us the shaft all day long. Final Rating is 4/10",

            "content": "People may praise this anime to the skies but I think otherwise. I first watched this show like a typical magic girl action anime with very low expectations (due too the nanoha similarities at the beginning). I wont try to spoil anything for you but the show starts to make drastic turns and got me excited for a couple of episodes but the excitement dies later on. I didn\u2019t like how utterly by the book it was at its presentation and story. It starts of like a typical magic girl anime. Episodes latter its not, but oh wait it resembles a typical tragic anime from90s-early 2000s. Everything just rolls along perfectly and foreshadowed predictably that it isn\u2019t a surprise to find people predicting the events that\u2019s going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t expecting something totally original and unpredictable. I was expecting something with a little character. Madoka has failed being the unique show I was looking for. I think it rose my expectations too high when I saw the first 6-8 episodes. And shows its true nature later on and it just becomes nothing more than a shell of its former self. I actually found my self rolling my eyes near the end. Nothing surprises me anymore, I don\u2019t care about the characters anymore because all of them seem to act completely out of character for the sake of drama. The character archetypes can be found in a random no name anime/manga so don\u2019t expect any deep characters. The story itself has been written a million times over since the beginning of time. There is nothing wrong with reinventing the wheel, but if you\u2019re going to do it make it unique. And the ending is a complete joke and typically anime like and follows anime laws.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is very bland and moeish. Shaft doesn\u2019t do the art justice with its annoying directing skills. The only good thing about this show is the action scenes. Its what got me hooked on this show in the first place. But the action takes a back seat for a poor excuse of a greek tragedy play.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch this show if you are expecting something fun, and don\u2019t watch this show expecting it to be something deep and character driven. Just turn your brain off and watch this show mindlessly like the people giving perfect tens on this show, and you will enjoy it.\\n",

But really, everything else was just bad. All the drama barely made me feel anything and it felt totally out of place especially towards the end when QB was talking about killing cattle and livestock. That whole scene was used to make all the obsessive fanboys/girls feel like the show just got DEEPER. I've heard that whole speech since I was in elementary school and every time I hear it, it's just a nuisance.\r\nI liked Madoka in the beginning, ithad a real good \"something\" going on, and that was the action, the plot actually having potential, and the emotion hitting you fairly hard. but when Walpurgis and time travel and forced drama came in, it was executed so badly it felt like I was just watching a bunch of girls talk about death. And thats just what it was.",

Isaid most likely.\\n\\n\r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: (10/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nThe story starts of with Madoka, a middle schooler of Mitakihara Middle School. One day, she had an encounter with a cute creature called Kyuubey and revealed that he can grant any wish she wants and in return, needs to make a contract with Kyuubey and become a Magical girl. Sounds fun and cute right? Yes, that's what the show wants you to believe. In the first 2 episodes, it starts of as just fun and cute and typical girls life. However, after the 3rd episode, the show starts to show off its true nature and begins to creep you a little bit and makes you wonder what's really going on in this universe. Every episode, the episode gets darker and darker and after the 10th episode, the show reveals the true full nature of the universe. Believe it or not, time travel/time altering is involved here and the show managed to make it work. It's a rare case because most shows today just f*cks up the story line when time travel/time altering is involved but here it was kind of easy to follow and no brainf*cks. Now here's my reasons on why I think the storyline of the show is a masterpiece. Firstly, one of the concepts of the show which is \"Would you do everything just to save your friend's life? Even if it affects your life\"? You wouldn't know that this concept was being used before watching the 10th episode. Why do I like this concept? Because it's an effective and dramatic story telling tool. It really shows how Homura deeply cared for Madoka. So much that she even kept time travelling just to figure out how to save here. She has been doing this for about 100 times and this obviously affected her emotionally and her personality even changed.  Secondly, the quote \"with great power comes with great responsibility\". It fits really well into the story. In the 2nd episode, the show makes you think that being a Magical Girl will make your life a bit easier since you now have magical powers. 3rd episode and further on proves that it isn't. There will be consequences to pay, including your life. Mami and Sayaka died and you know that they will never come back. Finally, the unexpected but happy ending. I thought that Madoka will make a wish, fight the final boss and they live happily ever after. That's not what exactly happened. I don't want to go through the details of the ending but all I want to say is it ended happy and extremely sad at the same time. The ending did feel a little bit rushed but I guess it's acceptable because of the fact that the show only had 12 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation might not be perfect but it was still great. The environment looked great and the labyrinth design looked weird but in a good way. Same goes for monster and witches design. They look weird but in a good way. The main and supporting character's design is what fooled me into thinking that this show was going to be some magical girls crap. I'm usually not a fan of these kinds of character design because they looked....well....unrealistic. Well, as they say, don't judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nSoundtrack didn't get a perfect score from me because not every theme I've heard was worth listening to. There are some that gave me a few goosebumps. How about the voice actors? Are they annoying? Nope and I loved every single voices here. I watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to give my opinions on English Dub VA. In my opinion, they were great, considering the fact that I've heard them before and they didn't sound horrible on the previous shows either. 4 of the main characters which is Homura, Madoka, Kyuubey and Hitomi were voiced by the VA who also voiced one of my favourite characters which is Mio, Azusa, Ritsu, and Tsumugi from K-On. One of the main characters which is Sayaka was voiced by the VA who also voiced Lizbeth from Sword Art Online. I absolutely loved her voice as Lizbeth and she was even more glorious to hear here. Now, the OP and ED soundtrack. Only 1 OP was used and I thought it was ok. Although, the opening was misleading (in a good way) and it felt like the 2nd Opening from SAO. By the tenth episode however, my opinions on the opening changed. You find out the lyrics is sung in Homura's point of view and the clips shown in the opening were actually Madoka's past timeline. Now my opinion on the OP song is it's great and very emotional.\\n\r\n 3 ED's were used. The 1st ED was also misleading and great. However, ED 2 which was sung by Kalafina is one of the greatest ED songs I've ever heard. It fitted the plot twist that happened after episode 3 ended. Never heard the 3rd ending because I skipped it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nYou thought the characters are going to be cute and all moe shit? Yea, keep believing that because that's what the show wants you to believe. At least, for the first 3 episodes. After watching the 3rd episode, the show will slap you so hard and that's where the characters faces the reality of being a magical girl. The show realistically depicts the struggles these characters go through each episode and that's what I loved most about the show. It also depicts the bonds and friendship these girls have towards each other. Which character do I like most? I'd go with Homura. If you read my review on the story section then you already know why. The show gave these characters some character development. Especially Homura. It will hit you right in the junk if you watch Homura's past. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nA perfect score from me. Why? Because of how the show tricked its viewers, making them believe that this was going to be some happy moe crap. Man, the drama and emotions at Ep. 10 and towards the end of the series really hit me so hard. So hard that I even shed a few tears and this is coming from a guy who rarely cries when I'm watching TV shows. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9.6/10)\\n\r\nAs much as I want to give this anime a perfect score of 10, I just can't. When I rate an anime a score of 10, everything has to be perfect. What I mean by everything is Story, Animation, Sountrack, and the Characters. Since the Animation and Soundtrack didn't get a perfect score due to reasons I listed above, the anime will not get a 10.\\n\r\nOverall, it's an enjoyable anime to watch and earned a spot for my \"Favourite Anime\" list. DO NOT let the cover and the plot synopsis fool you. Same thing happened to me too. I watched the first and second episode and I was like \"People love this sh*t\"? After the 3rd episode, I was like \"Oh Jesus Christ, I see\". \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Show tricked everyone\\n\r\n-Not what you were expecting\\n\r\n-Outstanding and Dramatic Story\\n\r\n-Great Animation\\n\r\n-Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Great Characters\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Ending felt a little bit rushed\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDo I need a closing sentence? If I do then this is my closing sentence:\\n\r\nEverything is a LIE!!!! \\n",

            "content": "I would like to preface my critique by stating that I am new to watching anime and to reviewing any series as a whole.  I enjoy fast-paced action dramas the most, especially those featuring leads with strong personalities.  And I have had no experience watching magical girls anime in the past.  With that being said, I had heard that Puella Magi Madoka Magica transcends its genre, so I decided to give it a shot.\r\n[Plot]\r\nI went into Puella Magi Madoka Magica hopeful.  I desperately wanted to love it, and I was expecting it to really pick up after episode 3 or 4.Yet there was something about the blend of pastel riddled innocence and trippy, Burton-esque darkness that didn\u2019t settle well with me. Admittedly, there was a slight turn for the better, but not enough to instill in me a strong desire to keep watching.  Nevertheless, I stuck it out and continued the show, if only because of its huge reputation.  To be frank, I didn\u2019t find many of the earlier plot twists very shocking, and I didn\u2019t feel personally invested in the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nMy perception of this show soon began to change, around episode 8 or 9.  Here I was beginning to get frustrated.  I found Kyubey\u2019s course of action to be predictable, and almost cheating on the part of the show\u2019s writers.  There were so many plot holes, and the science used to explain some of these plot holes was just plain wrong (from a physics, biology, and medical standpoint).  Plus, the show presented so many unanswered \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d for me that I was becoming more and more skeptical.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode ten was bittersweet.  I was impressed with the direction that the show had taken, and was excited to finally get answers to some of my questions.  But the further I progressed into this episode, somehow, the more disappointed I got.  Without getting into the physics, the events that took place in this episode completely nullify the explanation that Kyubey had given in the previous episode.  And what\u2019s more \u2013 I had seen this type of plot before.  While it might be a revolutionary idea in the magical girls genre, it certainly wasn\u2019t my first time seeing these sorts of events play out.  There was nothing I could distinctly say I had never seen before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would classify the story as fairly entertaining, but not high quality.  Those willing to overlook gaping issues in the show\u2019s logic will likely find more enjoyment in it than I did.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\r\nHere is where I believe Puella Magi Madoka Magica is most lacking.  Madoka is a flat, and to be honest, boring character that did absolutely nothing for me.  She is not interesting, and the fact that this show is so Madoka-centric was a little off-putting.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters start off in a very stereotypical fashion and don\u2019t really get that much more interesting.  Though it might be argued that they change perspectives throughout the story, I found the character development to be either too predictable or too unrealistic.  There seemed to be no happy medium.  Call me heartless, but I had a very hard time connecting to any of the characters personally.  They were all likeable enough, but there was no motivation for strong attachment.  Of all the girls, I would have to say that Homura is probably the most exciting, given the sacrifices she makes.  I could sympathize with her the most, even if her actions seemed a little unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while many people seem to like Kyubey, I have a few issues with him as well.  First and foremost, I could not (and still cannot) fully see him as a villain, probably because he reminds me too much of a rejected Pok\u00e9mon to be seen as that formidable of a threat.  Plus, his lack of true malice and total indifference as a facilitator doesn\u2019t make him seem like a true \u201cvillain.\u201d  But what really bothers me most are Kyubey\u2019s monologues.  If you\u2019re going to have a character centered on logic rather than emotion, make damn sure that the character\u2019s dialogue is, in fact, logical.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Sound]\\n\r\nThe art and sound of Puella Magi Madoka Magica were probably its best features.  The contrast between the animation style of the witches and that of the magical girls is outstanding as a means of symbolizing dark vs. light.  Although it was definitely unsettling for me at first, it was something I grew to appreciate as an art form the more I watched the series.  I do wish the characters were more unique in their designs.  While I can understand that certain animators have their own individual styles, I would have liked to see more variety.  Most of the characters were only distinguishable by their hairstyles and eye color, since they all wore the same school uniform when not in their transformed states. (With that being said, the costume design for each magical girl and the transformation animation were both on par).  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack certainly complimented the visuals, though the opening and ending themes weren\u2019t anything to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica was far from the masterpiece that it is claimed to be.  Though it certainly breaks away from the magical girls mold, it did not live up to the raving reviews that praised its name.  Yet even with all of my criticism it definitely wasn\u2019t a total waste of time. I would not classify Puella Magi Madoka Magica as a favorite, but it\u2019s certainly well worth a watch. \\n",

            "content": "*Might contains minor spoilers, after the review ends I put my interpretations which has 100% spoilers*\r\nMagical girl genre is one of the more niche genre even in anime community. Anime fans proportions is heavily dominated by action fans. Yet in this action fans group, chuuni subgenre can be considered as unpopular compared to those that dominated the market, with the only exceptions for nowadays being Fate series. But by combining the aspects of those in this two genres, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica has become a new achievement for the medium. It popularized both genres, and has made many other magical girl shows that's created afterwards, triedto imitate its legacy. Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is one of the few series which can be enjoyable by wider audiences, it can serves as one of the gateway anime for newcomers, those who watch anime casually for just hobbies, and even some anime veterans who have longer experience for the medium and loves analyzing anime.  More pros for me is that it has only 12 episodes so it's easy to binge, as I don't usually wanted to invest my time for a really long series except if I heard many good things about it.\\n\\n\r\nEntering Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, we will be greeted by pink haired girl, who runs throughout a long staircase until the door in the end of the staircase opened up for her, and then a bizarre scene featuring a black haired magical girl struggling in a hopeless fight against an abstract being which seemed to be from another world, with dark metal OSTs being played. This scene implies the tone of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica a lot. Introduction matters in order to grab one's attention towards a certain thing, it's called as first impression, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica can utilize it in order to make the combination of the two niche genre become popular, and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMagical girl genre has a history of having darker tone as the series goes and many of them also deal with the theme of sacrifice. While Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica also did the same with their predecessor, it also invented something's new, fresh, and ingenious messages that's being embedded as the core theme of the story. It meticulously utilizes forshadowing, characterizations, and dialogues in order to imply it, making this theme anything but hard to digest, at least for me. People who want to watch Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica however, can still enjoy the series for having a visually stunning fighting scenes, surreal magic world, the eerie-yet-relaxing atmosphere of the series thanks to the comfortable looking school, the tragic events that happened within the story, with the background music that's really strong to evoke such feelings to the viewers. Other people can also simply enjoy this series for being dark and full of despair without overthinking about it. Yet for some people, who likes to analyze a series Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica might also still hold a special place as a great work. When I firstly watched Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica as a new anime fan who only have few anime on my completed list, I consider it as awesome for the former reasons, yet when I decided to re-watch it after I learn on how to analyze works, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica have made me let out a sincere smile due to how intelligent it tries to deliver its core thematic elements with satisfactory ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe core thematic elements of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magicais simple, yet poignant. Imagine that you've met a creature who can grant you 1 wish of anything in your choice in-exchange that you'll become a magical girl that should fight against an evil beings called witches. Sounds cool? It maybe is for some watchers, and some others surely will notice that it's already said that such battles can costs your own life. Is there a wish that's more important than your own life? Being a chuuni genre, of course this theme looks exaggerated that one should fight in a life-and-death battle, so to put it realistically that almost everyone can apply it on their own life, \"When you wish for something, is it the actual thing you need the most from the inside of your mind so that if you die tomorrow, you will regret nothing?\" I have questioned this in my life for several times, and thankfully, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is the first step for me in order to realize the answer.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about plot points of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is impossible without mentioning the characters, as the structure of the story being a semi-character arc and in the end of almost every character arcs, new plot twists are introduced instead of being having \"Monster of the week\" plot progression, which I found in almost all magical girl shows that I have seen and I have to say honestly, that kind of plot progression is boring. This method of plot progression also will made the user think on how in the world will this series which has high dose of despair and hopelessness will end up as more twists are introduced? The first twist being the visual introduction of the actual tone of the story, the second being the introduction of the core thematic elements, which is further implied with Kyouko and Sayaka's dialogue before they started their next fight and lastly, the true definition of being a magical girl is on the world. Episode 10, which is infamous for having the rest of the cards being revealed from Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica's sleeves, can be interpreted in two ways. One may look it as an inevitable bad end that will land upon all the main characters that made the characters anguished until they developed into what they're yet still not solving the problem, while others might see it as a hope, which is foreshadowed on the episodes that the magical girl in action just have repeated the same mistakes over and over again in which the culmination of all the bad ends. But unbeknownst to her, had she did something that simple before, all the mistake she had should never happen. To summarize in the end, every characters on Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica have done the same mistake and that they can't tell the others before falling to the pit. As how the life implications will be when you have fall to these pit of \"can't think what you truly needs in mind yet have done said actions\", only regrets remains. I found that this mistake, despite on what kind of personality you have, has been at least done once by all people in the world, as nobody can escape for being wrong. And yet you need to get over with it and not fallen deeper, in this which part I will describe on the spoiler section.\\n\\n\r\nThe chuuni tone of this anime is also fun at least for me. It deals with the existentialism elements of the history of humanity and magical girls and how the world of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica works, befitting any of the common chuuni titles. According to my friend who studies Chemical engineering, it has some truth on it too, making it more appealing for those who are fans of the genre. One might question whether our universe is actually run with such conspiratory and unfair system, which is fun to think about it. I don't take it on an individual levle but simply because thinking like chuunibyous is fun to do.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica have a high production value and know how to use it properly in order to create an epic visuals that is surreal as if the existence of magic itself do exists in that world, having the witch labyrinth that gives a distorted feels on such an evil being, as expected from SHAFT studios which is renowned for its previous works Bakemonogatari. The character design looks nice too, and moreover, the magical girl clothes models can be linked to each of their own wishes. This also makes help on the characters memorability, aside from their quirks and character explorations, which I also have to put on the spoiler sections.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also wonderful. One can notice the level of voice acting with how much do you feel a character as they speaks, and I can at least totally understand their feelings even if I have to watch this raw despite not knowing what they're talking about. This is a sign of good  voice acting as if the voice actresses know how to blend with the characters personality and to evoke certain feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP lyrics is actually another foreshadowing on the show actual tone, as it is actually pretty sad, and the first scene itself shown that Madoka is crying on it so that one can already guess the tone shift, so I have to digress the people who said that it has no signs of it. The ED, which is actually the first song you've heard on the first 2 minutes and appears on episode 3, gives a darker tone, but the lyrics is surprisingly more positive compared to the OP. It also depicts on the magical girl chasing for hope through the darkness, in search for light that will brought peace upon her. As for the OSTs, like I have said before, brought by the talented composer Yuki Kajiura, it never fails to amuse me. My favorite OST among all of it would be \"Sis Puella Magica\", because it gives a strange sense of emotions for me. It feels both relaxing, mysterious, and depressing at the same time and this kind of theme truly befitting for Kyubey the most.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit that the cover poster of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is deceiving, it looks so lighthearted that people can easily mistaken it's a lighthearted series, despite it balanced the light and dark tone in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is a fantastic ride of a more chuuni magical girl series that you will hardly found in any other anime. Magical girl in general might be weird for having darker tone in the end, but Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica put it on another level along with the implication of a simple yet profound themeatic elements, yet subtly show that a speck of light on the darkness of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica can be seen, if one have enough love for it. It is by no means a perfect work, as there's few off-model scene and the character arcing is too visible that it doesn't have dynamics that much except for the characters required for said arcs, but it has achieved many things it has to offer for me for just 12 episodes in an entertaining way. It skillfuly throw hints on what this core thematic elements is all about that those who have enough love on it will realize on how compelling Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica actually is.\\n\\n\r\nThis marks the ends of this review with minor or might be no spoilers. For the implications of said themes to each characters for you who have lesser love for the series to realize it, which I have already posted it outside of MAL (100% spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are more of focused on Mami Tomoe, the senior magical girl which saved Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki from the witches. She can be described as a seemingly poised but actually fragile and reckless person. This is reflected on her fight with Charlotte (and it's emphasized on episode 10 when she is the one who lost her emotion control the first after realizing the truth of being a magical girl and shot the others.) When her family involved in a car accident, Kyubey approached her to offer her to become a magical girl and granting her a wish, and her wish is to live her life by her own, possibly because she know that she won't survive without her parents financially. So now let's see now on the basic traits of Mami, shall we? Among all of the Magical Girls introduced within this series, Mami looks the most elegant and luxurious of all. This is reflected by her magical girl character design (She has a curly tails harstyle while all the other girls have a simple and plain hairstyle, Her dress also gives splendor feels the most for me, and yellow is the color that represent money for me), the way she fights witches that backed up with the soundtrack \"Credens Justitiam\" make me feels that she's a gorgeous magical girl who fights for justice, and the place where she lives looks the most expensive compared to others. For me, all the splendor that Mami has was all rooted from her wish when she made a contract with Kyubey, which makes sense. But then again, is Mami's wish all that she will need the most for her life? How is it when a middle school girl live alone without feeling the love of her parents despite already having a luxurious life? I bet the first word that comes to mind will be: Lonely. Yes, Mami is a really lonely person in the heart, which is shown during some scene before she tried to fight Charlotte in episode 3. Moreover, she is also the most mentally unstable among the girls. For me this implies that her parents really loves and cares about her, so that the sudden loss of that feelings gives Mami a shock effect that makes her to that state.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character that I will talk about is Sayaka Miki. My comments on Sayaka Miki's characterization in it's simplest form will be \"The least historical but the most fleshed out.\" She is depicted as a tomboy girl which is Madoka's best friend and classmate. Like Mami, she also has a strong sense of justice, proven on how she acts during the first time she become a magical girl. After Mami's death, she got a bit concerned about being a magical girl, but then she decided to do so, after knowing that her crush Kyousuke has suffered an injury on his hand so that he could never play violin again, which is his best abilities he likes to do, she decided to become a magical girl with the wish to heal Kyousuke. But is that what Sayaka Miki needs the most? Let's see how the story will flow further. At the first glance, Sayaka was so happy seeing that Kyousuke was healed and he can play the violin again, and Kyousuke looked happy to at Sayaka when he return to play violin. Sayaka then, as a magical girl began to hunt down for the witches, even the witches independent familiars (The one that also appears within the witches labyrinth, but then flew away from it. It can devour humans to turn themselves to witches but in that form, they don't drop grief seeds.) Another magical girl called Kyoko confronted her shortly, telling her that a familiar don't drop the grief seeds, thus making them useless to be killed and that she shall wait for it to become a witch so that it will clean her soul gem from being tainted. But Sayaka got enraged, believing that it's the same with she let a human die, which means killing humans for her. The two engaged in fight but Homura comes for them to cease the fight after Sayaka seems to be losing. But because of her wish that is related with healing, her pain dissipates quickly. They both have another fight in a street bridge after Kyoko said that she should've wished for him to like her and now that its too late, she will break her leg to make it happen, also with the prescence of the other two magical girls, and Kyubey. But this time Madoka threw up Sayaka's soul gem, hoping that doing so will prevent them to fight further. But another plot twist has just began. Sayaka lost her consiousness while Homura was chasing for the soul gem and returning it to Sayaka. Kyubey then explained that during the process of one to be a magical girl, when they're saying their wishes, their soul was being extracted and turned to be the soul gem, rendering them unconscious if their soul was 100 meters away from them. This subverted almost everything we expect about being a magical girl during the first two episodes (yeah I know that some magical girl anime have a somewhat tragic theme, but this anime didn't try to make it so at its first impressions.) After the incident, Kyoko tried to befriend Sayaka, but Sayaka with her strong sense of justice, often left her and keep thriving against all witches and familiars, doing what she believe was right. But then when she heard that her friends Hitomi, who also have a crush with Kyousuke was going to confess to him, she began to fell in despair. She feels that she can't be a good couple with Kyousuke with her current condition. She afraid on how if he knows that she was practically a zombie that fights against so many grotesque looking monsters. So by this time, we know that Sayaka's wish wasn't what she need the most. Ironically, its on what Kyoko said to her, which is to make Kyousuke fall in love with her. Because of this one mistake Sayaka has done, her personality grew darker as she rampagingly fought through countless of witches and familiars. She didn't even take the grief seeds, believing that its pointless now that her wish went wrong. She fell deeper into despair when she heard some guy badmouthing about a girl which is implied to be a magical girl. She got angered upon them and its implied that she murdered them both, believing that those guys aren't any better compared to the witches. So let's see now, does Sayaka still bring positivity, justice, or whatever you call it after knowing Hitomi was going to confess to Kyousuke? Or is it the opposite? Isn't she just become like the witches now that she killed those guys despite their attitude? And most of all did she still have any positive aura on her? All we can see is just that she was in a total desperation and even brought negativity rather than the positive. So now we even can come up with the question: Isn't this Sayaka become more and more witch like? And so it happened, when Sayaka's desperation was already beyond help, her soul gem shattered and she turned to a witch. The lesson is: Don't let yourself being eaten by hopelessness just because one of your wish went wrong, move on and do what you think is the best for you and this world sake.\\n\\n\r\nLet's went to another character now, I bet you can already guess who is it. Yep, it's Kyoko Sakura. Kyoko is by far the best characterized magical girl for me. She has a balance between her backstory and how she acted on the series. Unlike Mami, Kyoko comes from a terrible family records, which makes her quirks differs alot with Mami. Her father was a preacher. When Kyoko's father see the suffering of some people, he thinks that the church must be revolutionized so that he used a new doctrine for his church. But then again most people seems to be disagree and thus they left the church one by one. Kyoko's family went to an extreme poverty after that. Kyubey then came and offered Kyoko a contract. She wished for her father to regain his followers. But is it what she need the most? Will her wish become as what she wanted or will it backfires? The fact happens to say that its the latter. Kyoko's father happened to be disliked on how his followers acted more of a cultist rather than a normal person. It went worse when Kyoko said about the truth. His father claimed that she isn't any better than the witches and he began to lose his sanity, become a drunker, and ultimately killed all of the family. Yep, Kyoko have done the same mistake Sayaka did. She should've wish for her family wealth and happiness instead and she knew if she just did a mistake on her wish. Kyoko's changes on her family was less of a shock compared to Mami's and was never to be as loved as, making her personality firmer, selfish, and more badass. She is more tomboy than Sayaka. Also the fact that her family has ever suffered in an extreme poverty made her value food so much, which is shown on how she was angry when Sayaka thrown the apple she gave to her on episode 7. She also believed that humans, witches, and magical girls is just like a food chain and only kill the witches. After Sayaka's collapsing incident when they have some fight and Kyobey explained some fact about being a magical girl, felt decieved, she got angry upon Kyubey saying that he only turned them to zombies. But this event also makes Kyoko felt sympathy for Sayaka, thinking that they both have did the same mistake and undergo the same burden of being a magical girl, and both girls being tomboys. And this is where we can see the difference between Kyoko and Sayaka, which is Kyoko is a more easy-going person, given she has went through a lot of shit which was worse than knowing the truth of being a magical girl compared to Sayaka. This also being showed before that she didn't hold grudges to Homura for stopping her fight seemingly sided with Sayaka when she come to her when she played some Pump it Up like games while eating chocolate sticks. She also cared a lot about Sayaka's safety, proven that she always followed wherever Sayaka hunt for the witches and familiars and she even helped her once, and probably will do that more if she got overwhelmed. She still wanted to save Sayaka, despite the girl had already turned to a witch. She asked Madoka to help her on this. During the fight, Madoka tried to call for Sayaka's witch form in attempt to make her back to her original state while Kyoko dodged and defended her attacks. But it happens to be pointless. So that Kyoko perform a double suicide with the witch with her magical ability while Madoka got escorted by Homura who was arrived just then. This showed us on how Kyoko truly loved Sayaka, given the fact that she could care less about justice, other people's sake, and even other magical girls. Overall I think Kyoko is actually a likable badass redhead girl. She has a great resolution and strong too. Her musical theme is somewhat gives damp and soft feelings, in contrast to most of our first impression to her, perhaps this was meant for she show her caring side towards Sayaka after episode 6. Also, I like cheongsam!\\n\\n\r\nOkay so we will go with the character which is liked the most by the fandoms (me too), Homura Akemi. Homura was actually starts off to be the most timid among all the magical girls, even more than Madoka. When she was just recovered from a long-term illness, which made her not being able to attend school for a long time, she enrolled on Madoka's Middle School on Mitakihara. Homura during this time had a twin braid hairstyle, wear an eyeglasses, and weak at sports, the complete opposite on what she is when she was introduced on episode 1. Madoka is the first person who acted like her close friend to her, while also saving her life when she was being attacked by a witch along with the other 3 magical girls. They become friends each other. Homura is the only person who haven't become a magical girl yet during this timeline. When there's a giant witch called Walpurgisnacht attacked the city, the magical girl team had a fight with the witch, and ended with all of the magical girl are killed in process, due to the massive amount of strength this witch have. During this time, Homura was saddened seeing Madoka, the one she loved the most, dying. So she made a contract with Kyubey and wished to be able to redo her first encounter with Madoka. So then during this timeline, there's 5 magical girls. But things still not fixed. Homura is the only magical girl who survived, whilst Madoka, struggling for her life in agony got her soul gem tainted so much that Homura witnessed by herself on how she became a witch. Homura then resetted the time, now trying to tell them the dark truth behind being a magical girl. Things didn't work perfectly as Homura wanted, Sayaka put her distrust upon Homura and parted way with the team, and turned into a witch, possibly due to the same reason on what happened on the previous episodes. After defeating Sayaka, the girls now believed on what Homura said before, but Mami loses control on her emotion and wanted to kill all the other magical girl. She killed Kyoko in the process, but stopped and shot by Madoka when she was going to kill Homura. So now there are only two magical girls remaining. They ended up defeated Walpurgisnacht, but both are in a dying state and there's only 1 grief seed remained. Madoka asked Homura to use the seed and kill her, in which Homura once again turned the time back after doing so. Through countless number of time loops, Homura still failed to save Madoka. This is what made Homura got desensitized and being somewhat \"cold\" towards stuffs, even deaths, because she had witnessed it countless number of times. She also may have used her infinite time to practice a lot amount of skills (shown by how she was superb at sports and studies during the first episode compared to how she was during episode 10.) But her goal is still the same, which is to prevent Madoka becoming a magical girl, which is obvious upon all the word she said during all of the episodes. So did Homura's wish actually what she needed the most? No, what she obviously need is just living happily together with her friend which she love and adores so much, Madoka Kaname, forever. Despite not actually care about other magical girl life other than Madoka, she still has her human sense of pity, seen by how she try to give Sayaka some grief seed knowing that she will become a witch if she didn't use it. I know what people likes about Homura, which is probably her cool looking style and behavior, her black design (lol she do the flipping so many times) and also what she have gone through. Yep, I like that about her too, she was so determined to save Madoka. But then things got worse after she knows that Madoka and Walpurgisnacht got stronger on each of her time travel so that she was trying to defeat the witch alone. But sadly she failed until \"it\" happened. Lastly, her music theme is somewhat feels like a hidden sadness for me, which is revealed to be true at episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nNow before go with Madoka, let's go with Kyubey first, shall we? This creature is also have strong determination to make teens a magical girl, which is in this case we see a lot is Madoka. He even went as far as lied to Madoka on saying \"It's been a pleasure to know you.\" to make her a magical girl. The fact on why he wanted to do so is that because there's some energy that can be actively used when a magial girl turned to witch so that it would prevent the world from doomsday, which also means his species extinction. Well I've read somewhere about the theory of creation that the universe are created from a \"Big Bang\" which one gigantic star explodes and all its matters separated and went away each other and it has something like nebula on it, which created stars, planets, etc. If all of the gigantic star matters keep went away, the nebula will be finally drained and no more stars will be created, whilst the existing star will die and it will be a true doomsday if no new stars were created. If being a magical girl can be used to made some spacial energy to nebula or to at least preserve the Sun energy than it makes sense for Kyubey to want more magical girls. He also said to Madoka that the collaboration between human and incubators already exist since the beginning of the human age, and the wish of all the girls is what make human civilizations grow further. But he hide all this dark truth, in fact, he did it on purpose to make one impression on being a magical girl is fun so that they made contract with him. Sadly enough, since there's noone would ever think that far, one wouldn't ask for it so he will never tell about it. What makes him creepier is that he didn't have any kinds of feelings, and will do everything to achieve his purpose while still maintaining his cute an innocent design. Cute and expressionless, now that's a combination that I've never seen before.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now let's go to our final character we're going to talk about on this series, Madoka Kaname. Alright I got it, she got most of the screentime so you can see on how she was first being introduced as your typical cute, hopeful, and innocent little middle schooler who came from a fine family until that ending. She was the most excited to become magical girl after being introduced about it by Mami, but she haven't think about the wish well, since she knows that it can only be used once so it must be thinked properly. But then she got concerned about it after seeing Mami's death. Imagine how shocking would it be for a person like Madoka to see that scene? That would be the most horrible thing she had ever seen and will traumatize her hard, right? That's why she got depressed about Mami more compared to Sayaka, supported that she is the type who wanted everyone to be friends and happy. She try to avoid fights as much as she can, she even try to stop any fight between the girls, shown by her act of throwing Sayaka's soul gem before they fought (actually she wanted to stop the fight before too, but being powerless and they already fought, she can't do a thing.) The interesting things is that there's always some incident that happened on this timeline in which prevent Madoka to made contract with Kyubey, so finally what Homura have did for ages have grown its fruit. Yes, she got mindraped the most by Kyubey during this timeline, but its still better than losing her life and turned to a witch. But the main difference that happened during this timeline is that she realized that being a magical girl can turn one to a witch before she herself turned to a magical girl. So after knowing all the truth all over through all the incidents, she changed as a person. Now she know how she should say her wish and really determined to do it compared to how she was during the first time, it is even emphasized by her against her mother for the first time for this. Now then let's analyze this. When Homura almost end upp in a total deseration and turned to a witch, Madoka finally come and made her wish to Kyubey. Her wish is to \"Erase every witch that has ever existed and those who yet to be born in every universe, and if there's any law that forbid her to do so, those law will be broken.\" This means that Madoka's wish will broke the law of nature and thus making herself the new law of nature, rendering her a godlike being, since that means she also erased her own witch which is yet to be born. Did Madoka happy in the end after reaching her godhood? Yes, she stated that at the conversation with Homura. Did she achieve her goal to made all the magical girls happy and have no woorries on their life? Yes, although it will be sad for Homura at the first time, but she recovered from it some time after the event.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is my favorite anime. It achieved way too much on just 12 episodes. The plot twist that this show brought really will give any middle school girl into a total despair and hopelessness, if that was real. It also explores through how people wish can be wonderful if done right, and how it could backfire when it isn't truly what they need the most, and how each characters used their wish for with their respective results. Also the show didn't make us to notice that the \"wish granting\" system is heavily flawed so that it is possible for someone like Madoka to break through it. I've been in middle and high school too and there's so many people who can't describe what they actually need properly, which been done by mostly female over male statistically. So does this show meant to be for everyone? I guess not, some people may dislike the progress of this show theme from being heartwarming to downright gloomy. But since it only has 12 episodes, I think everyone should try this anime, and for deciding whether they like it or not, that's all back to yourself. And if you asked about my favorite Puella Magi, I'll said that I liked them all firstly, but if I have to sort it out from my most favourites that would be Homura, Kyoko, Sayaka, Madoka, Mami. Via all these characters struggles, this story tells about a life-changing themes.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of this story: In some events of life, you may have encountered a big problem, or your wish didn't go as well as what you need that is seemingly impossible to face them with a smile. But you must! Just do it! The moment you whine and desperate about it is the moment you become a \"witch\", the one who causes negativity to others that may give birth for another problems for others while not solving yours. Use any methods, as long as its legal, and the path will open itself for you as long as you never give up.",

            "content": "I'm probably going to get tons of negative comments about this, but for some reasons, Puella Magi Madoka Magica didn't live to the expectation I got while reading the reviews on MAL, or the other ones online. \r\nEDIT : it's come to my attention that it would be important to precise that I was new to the Maho Shoujo genre, which might cause disagreement upon my review. It's understandable, really. I wrote this review with nothing to compare the anime to. \r\nStory : 7/10\r\nI was in my horror anime phase when Madoka came to me in a suggested anime list. For this only point, theanime deserves a strong 10. The ambiance is creepy and a lot more will be said on the Art/Sound points. However, since this is really about the story, I might want to explain why the anime deserve a 7 from my part. I really, really felt like the story was way (way, way, way) too much for the small amount of episodes. Madoka brings you to an universe that had a lot of potential : magic. Dealing with magic in an anime is pretty much opening every possible door and I felt like only a few were opened. Sure, the witches were present to doom this world and make fall in despair and agony, but there are some details that weren't clear, that didn't satisfy my curiosity of always knowing more. I'm like that, so it's pretty much a personal overview. \\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, very good art, BUT, only on the scary side. The characters were well drawn, but pretty much all over the same height, same kind of face, same kind of clothes. HOWEVER, the witches art, everything that is inside them is completely insane. It's a crazy universe, at one time very creepy and awfully ugly. This, along with the sound effects I will talk about, makes watching Madoka worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nIncredible. The music, the sound effects, everything. You say magic, you get magic. Sounds are well done, incredibly accurate for the ambiance of the anime. This deserves a strong 10, or even 11 if I could. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is where I lost it. I understand how people might have seen the friendship, the bonds and especially the struggle of the characters, trying to save the world knowing they were doomed to begin with, but I didn't see it quite this way. In my opinion, Homura is the only character that deserve an higher note than 6. Madoka is the classic main character who does the impossible at the very end to save it, while Mami is the strong and confident character that guides the other on the right path. Sayaka is the weak-hearthed but strong-willed character who wants to help but can't and Kyoko is the classic vilain-not-so-vilain character. Again, I understand how people could have seen the over view of the characters, the bonds they shared, but I'm analyzing them on a personal point of view and on an individual basis. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFor my part, everything was really rushed in. For some animes, this method works, they're made to be fast (I'm thinking of Btooom! or Elfen Lied, for example). However, Madoka, in my humble opinion, deserved way more episodes than that (I know there were movies, but please bare with me, I'm rating the anime). I watched it really fast and I think that it just went by, nothing really had the time to amaze me, even the 'so massive' plot twist of the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is a nice anime. It has some fairly good points, it is creepy and it gets you in an hollow mood. Pretty much what you'd be looking for if you were seeking something similar to Higurashi no Naku Koro, which, in a way, shares many similarities (young girls, normal ambiance mixed with very creepy and scary stuff). I would recommend Madoka Magica, but with caution. I know it is considered as a masterpiece by many users on here, but for me, it was only a good anime with amazing music and sounds, but way too short for it's potential. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, critics are welcomed, but only if you motive them for a reason different than '' I liked it, your review is bad, you suck ''. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "\"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is the epic tale of one Paella Magi (magic users who direct their talents towards making ludicrously tasty paella) named Madoka and her life long quest to make the ultimate paella, the Paella of the Gods. In order to do that, she must first obtain that rare and elusive ingredient - the mythical pokemon Magikarp.\r\nYou may have realised by this point that I'm trolling you. And that's a bit like this anime: while the early episodes baits viewers into thinking it's an extremely moe magical girl show, with the only thing remarkable about it being extraordinary width of the moe girls'faces, it soon reveals itself as something unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the traditional demographic of a magical girl show is young girls, \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" isn't. Though the cutsey element is there, it's accompanied by a strong, detestable whiff of moe. That's right, in keeping with the trend in recent years, it's one of those magical girl shows aimed at pokemon trainers. And by pokemon trainers I mean otakus.\\n\\n\r\n\"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is really about some mutated squirrel thing named Kyubei trying to persuade Madoka and her friends - but mostly Madoka - to make a contract with him to become Paella Magi (or Magis? What's the plural for this word??) who can go around battling witches (who causes bad things to happen to people, like suicides and stuff) with their magical power. But soon it becomes clear that this is far from the whole story...\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes probably strike most as being ok at best and terrible at worst depending on their level of tolerance for generic magical girl fluff (of which I'm not particularly fond of) and bland moe guff (of which I'm allergic to). Underneath it all though, there's a hint of something unsettling, like a stray note sneaking into an otherwise consonant chord. This starts to manifest itself towards the end of the third episode, at which point the series starts to show its true form as a dark, twisted subversion of the genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the series contains plenty of shocking revelations, religious symbolisms, and a dose of moral dilemmas thrown in for good measure. It seems that the purpose of the earlier magical moeblob material is to lull you into false expectations that the later episodes can rudely jerk you out of. \\n\\n\r\nJust how well does the whole thing work though?\\n\\n\r\nWell first of all, the moe still annoys me, and was a big barrier I had to get past in order to enjoy the show. I understand that it's used for misdirection, but do they really need do it this way? \"Planetes\" (now THERE'S a truly excellent show) did a similar thing, but mostly through its story instead of deliberately being obnoxious. Even in this show itself, Kyubei's cute mascot-esq exterior only makes him seem more sinister than annoying when constrasted with his unknown intentions. Clearly, making the show very moe isn't necessary, and I'm not entirely convinced that it's there PURELY for misdirection and not for pandering purposes. Perhaps I'm just a cynic. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the visual style. Trashy moe character designs aside (Madoka's mum could have passed for her sister), I've never been a fan of SHAFT's style, and even though people tell me \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is the least \"SHAFTy\" work they've done, I can still see it quite clearly. Just look at the glass classrooms; odd designs for things like buildings, chairs, and decorations... it's the kind of things Apple would come up with, if they did interior designs. Like Apple, SHAFT often gives off an annoyingly smug air of pretension, and of style over substance. No where is this more obvious than in the witch fighting scenes. Within the realms of witches, the show tries to build up an overwhelming sense of chaos and madness by continuously bombarding your visual sensors with sprawling masses of psychedelic, surreal imagery: cut out butterflies; wicked barbed wires strewn across the screen; grand concert halls with designs reminiscent of the style of \"Gankutsuou\"... the themes vary from encounter to encounter, often accompanied by discordant instrumentals or wailing vocals, curtesey of the distinctive compositions of Yuki Kajiura. Is it different? Hell yes! Is it effective? If truth be told, it's all a bit too much. With the exception of one or two scenes, most of fighting feels flat and dull in spite of, or rather because of, the eccentric art style. There's a sense that it's trying too hard to be different... just for the sake of being different (a very SHAFT thing to do), and the design themes (with the aforementioned exceptions,) mostly have little if any relevance to the battle at hand. At least the music is good though.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is probably the main draw of \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" - it's full of the unexpected, and isn't afraid to think big. Some parts are deliberately left vague to let viewer draw their own conclusions, and from the amount of discussion the show's generated, it's clear it's been effective in that regard. Although there're a few plot holes if you look a bit deeper, I think those who take it apart and catalogue its plot holes are missing the point a little - first of all, it's no good trying to apply hard logic to some of the abstract concepts which can be open to interpretation; also, given the scale of story and the fact that it involves overpowered elements such as wishes, it's almost too much to expect the story to be completely water tight. For what it's attempting, I think it's a damn good effort just to make the plot (mostly) functional, at least on the surface. It's hard to say much more without spoiling things, and believe me, there's a heck of a lot to spoil. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast starts off pretty generic, particularly Madoka herself, a timid girl whose paper thin personality can be summised by the description \"naively nice\". Other characters were also pretty forgettable, if not as annoying as Madoka - I remembered most of them as \"Madoka's friends\" - and even Homura seems to fall unremarkably into the quiet and mysterious stereotype bin. A few episodes in though, some of the characters starts to grow beyond their 1D state. Sayaka (fomerly known as one of \"Madoka's friends\") is fleshed out through her unyielding ideals (and/or selfish desires?); Homura through her compelling backstory later on; and Madoka... remains naively nice. (If it wasn't for the fact that she's the titular main character, I'm not sure I could have remembered her name...) \\n\\n\r\nDespite the brainless drivel that assaulted me in the early episodes, the dialogues in \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" can be superb when it tries, adding depth to the characters as well as throwing in some philosophical musings. Kyouko's telling of her own backstory contains a good dose of cynicism on human nature; Homura's despairing admissions of her feelings in the final episode is heart wrenching; Kyubei's dispassionate speech about cows (yes, cows) and the greater good knocks down the ego-inflated perception of our own worth. Those are some of the most memorable, most poignant moments from the show. There's a limit to how deeply (as in, not very) the show looks at these issues, but it generates enough food for thought to lift it above being mere shallow entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I do think it's a show that's clever rather than intelligent. It's the kind of show that you can spend ages trying to work out details of what happened, or freeze frame and observe the plethora of symbolisms littered around the witches' realms. But it all boils down to a superficial coolness rather than something deep. The various themes it does touch on are used for making the story darker and colourful rather than as topics for serious exploration. That's not what it's going for though - it's no \"Planetes\" after all.\\n\\n\r\n\"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" could have been improved with more episodes. Though for the majority of it the pacing is great, revealing bits and pieces of the plot at just the right times, there are some parts that feels rushed. For example Kyouko's change of attitude feels too quick to be convincing; one shocking piece of revelation about paella magis fell out of a facepalm worthy act of stupidity on Madoka's part, and the event feels too engineered to be beliveable. Also, Homura's backstory episode bulldozed through an incredible amount of material, mowing down character consistency and story integrity along the way... it was like killing someone by bashing their brains out with a hammer - powerful, effective, but a bit crude.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I should talk about the ending, considering all the hoo-ha it caused. I personally really like it. For me, it wraps up things up in satisfactory fashion, both emotionally and in terms of the story. What's more, provided a kind of justification for the design of Madoka's personality - Madoka's fate and what it symobolised could only have worked so well with the pure and naive personality she has.\\n\\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration, \"Paella Magi Madoka Magikarp\" is an over hyped show. I think those that who are writing essays on the deeper meanings it contains are crediting it with more depth than it has. End of the day, \"Paella Magi Madagasca Madoka Magikarp\" is a rollercoaster ride that goes a bit too fast at times and is un-necessarily coated in moe style... but it's a ride I ultimately enjoyed. For a show that mainly aims to be entertaining and to keep viwers guessing, it's done more than enough.",

            "content": "Under the crimson red glow of the sun, the girls jump into action. At the prompt of their premeditated quote varying from the power of friendship to that of installing justice, hurled at their enemy, the girls begin to transform (for you see, it is entirely impossible for a girl to do so without following this procedure, or, at the very least, posing brazenly in wake of their opponent that lays before them). Exploding into a barrage of colours and lights, while simultaneously losing their clothing for a brief period of time (but worry not, as, you see, those mysterious lights that accompany a magicaltransformation will cover up all the bits that would normally place you on the FBI watchlist if they were absent). As the transformation sequence is complete (a process that may take upwards of sometimes two minutes; no idea why the enemy just doesn\u2019t attack them during that time since they are left completely vulnerable, but whatever), the girls take their stance, posing passionately at their enemy before them. The magical girls are ready to fight\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWhen the general public thinks of anime, several connotations and images are typically brought up, ranging from the battle shounen, in which two guys beat the hell out of each other with massive muscles, typical ecchi oriented anime in which girls are drawn to have ridiculously small skirts and extremely large breasts, and the most prolific, at least from what I\u2019ve gathered from asking family and colleagues at university about this very same subject, are that of the magical girls! Even if you\u2019re not particular that versed in magical girl oriented anime, as am I (for I\u2019ve only seen the Sailor Moon series, Lyrical Nanoha and the show of discussion today) you\u2019re at the very least probably familiar with the genre\u2019s typical troupes and conventions, as the magical girl genre is perhaps the most parodied within the medium with countless examples out there, from Puruin in Welcome to the N.H.K to Stardust Witch Mereru in Oreiemo. As a result, there are several things people tend to associate with the magical girl genre, as I tried to replicate in my opening paragraph (and probably failed at mind, you) but there exists several deconstructions out there, going against the norm of what is to be expected from this typically more so child-friendly content, with the most popular example of these shows being Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica from 2011, becoming one of the most successful and popular anime ever created! But, alas, with all that said and done, let\u2019s make a wish with some random cat who clearly looks like he will screw us over at some point, transform into a magical girl and dive into the world of Madoka!\\n\\n\r\nMadoka, our main protagonist for this tale, along with her best friend, Sayaka, are regular middle-schoolers, until, that is, they encounter an adorable cat, by the name of Kyuubey, whom is capable of speech and through this, offers to produce a contract between each of the girls, resulting in them becoming magical girls (as Kyuubey needs them to fight off against these monster-like things called Witches) in exchange for one of their wishes to be granted. As the series goes along, more magical girls are introduced into the story, as the characters suffer through disappear and hardships, and, to cap it off, a lot of death as well! Madoka\u2019s tone is one that takes a much more depressing and darker route than what is to be expected of these kinds of shows, and is consistent in its setting and overarching themes to make the world in which these characters inhabit, all the more bleak and miserable, with the constant threat of death always lurking around the corner, thus creating a sense of narrative stakes and tension since it is established early on in episode three, that characters do, and ARE going to die! This lends itself naturally in creating scenes with much more emotional weight, and the darker setting the narrative presents never really felt too forced, or what I\u2019d usually classify as \u201cedgy\u201d. The show never tries to push its darker themes or ideas too hard to the point where it becomes silly, and instead opts for a mature and realistic tone that I feel was implemented in a serious and thought-out manner. The pacing for the show as well was also pretty consistent, moving the narrative along at a well enough pace to keep story beats moving. One thing that I actually really liked about the pacing, was how long it actually took for the girls to make up their minds in regards to their wish and what the dangers of accepting the contract may entail. I originally believed they\u2019d make their wish at the first moment they could get within the first episode, but, instead, they ponder at great lengths, weighing it up in their mind, and as such, helped to ground the characters in a greater sense of believability, and made them seem more mature and rationale. Although, one thing I never really understood, is that why did none of the girls ever wish for more wishes? It was never established in the show that you are not allowed to do so, so why did none of the girls ever attempt this, especially since the wish is being promised by a cat who can talk! Maybe having more wishes could act as a means of reverting back, or changing something that may have gone wrong with your initial wish. Of course, this piece of criticism is one that is pretty pedantic, nor does it really effect my overall feelings towards the show, but I felt the need to point it out anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has enough plot twists and forks in the road to keep things interesting, and Kyuubey\u2019s sudden reveal of new information to the girls that changes up the entire dynamic of how we think of the magical girls in general are easily some of my favourite moments in the show. Kyuubey is one sick pussy! As part of a race that always thinks cold and calculated, lacking any kind of emotion or sympathy for the magical girls he has created (whom he sees more so as pawns if anything else), Kyuubey upholds vital information in regards to the true nature of the magical girls and these sudden twists were one of the few incentives I had to keep watching, but I also feel that this makes Madoka a one trick pony, at least for me anyway. Kyuubey\u2019s plot twists were one of only two things in the entire show to actually keep be invested in what I was watching and while I believe the show can be rather entertaining the first time through since one doesn\u2019t know of the plot twists in the narrative, it leaves me with little desire to ever go back and watch again, which I suppose is fine, but I also value re-watchabiltiy in a title, and I feel that the other elements in Madoka are not strong enough to warrant another watch, and I don\u2019t feel like I could get anything out of a second watch. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, and Madoka achieves what it sets out to do in regards to its narrative fairly well, but, again, this is quite a personal nit-pick for me, and perhaps quite a pedantic complaint none-the-less. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, a less pedantic piece of criticism stems from the use of exposition in the show, and how overwhelming it can be at times. There are many times in the narrative in which Kyuubey dishes out exposition to the magical girls, about the origin of them or of himself, which, in small increments, can be interesting in learning more about the world, but these exposition scenes can go on for quite a while, and since so much information is being thrown at us in such a short amount of time, my brain eventually shuts off and I lose interest, especially since the exposition isn\u2019t delivered in the most exciting way either. Now, one may argue that the exposition dumps in Madoka are justified since they given by Kyuubey, a creature who\u2019s very existence is one that is very calculated and mechanical-like, so it makes sense for him to deliver information in such a way, and that is something I can totally understand, but it still doesn\u2019t eliminate the problems I just mentioned, and if the exposition was spaced evenly over the course of the show, it would have helped to alleviate these problems for me greatly.\\n\\n\r\nSome moments in the narrative can feel kind of trite and forced too, and depending on your tolerance levels, can put a damper on the entire experience. One such example of forced drama implementation is in regards to Sayaka, and the boy whom she loves, being taken away by one of her best friends. This love triangle sort of thing is not inherently a bad element on its own, but my main complaint is that this idea is never really fleshed out, nor is there any pay-off in regards to it either, and it felt like it was only there just to make Sayaka suffer all the more, and thus can come across as rather unnecessary in my eyes. There were also a few moments of poor comedy as well, in regards to the girl\u2019s homeroom teacher who constantly complains and rants about the lack of dick in her life, and a friend of Sayaka\u2019s and Madoka\u2019s who believes they have entered into a homosexual relationship with each other and runs away, screaming! Thankfully, there were few scenes of this nature, but they often came across as jarring and mainly unfunny while watching the show. There was also a certain level of disconnect I got when watching the series since the girls sometimes acted in such a way to bring me out of my immersion, such as in the case where in the first episode, where, Madoka, hearing the cries of help from Kyuubey whom she hasn\u2019t met yet, runs out of a music store and into some kind of underground area, and this always came across as strange to me as we just see her pop up there with no interconnecting dots showing us how she even got there in the first place since the latter locale seems like it would take a significant amount of time to reach. In addition, I often found it kind of strange how Madoka and Sayaka were pretty calm about seeing one of their upperclassman as a magical girl along with a talking cat, and instead of freaking out or just simply acting surprised like regular people, they decide to drink tea and eat cake, as if this event is one that happens every day! Again, this may seem like something small and insignificant to talk about, but its moments like these that drag me out of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite a few problems here and there in regards to the narrative, it\u2019s overall pretty solid and does its job well for what It was trying to achieve; it reaches for the stars and tries to be as ambitious as it can in many areas and just falls short (especially with an ending that feels very much like The End of Evangelion of all things! Thankfully there is no scene where Madoka masturbates over someone else\u2019s body!) However, my main problems with Madoka lies in its cast and how little I care for anyone, which is a massive problem considering that the entirety of the narrative stakes and threat of death present is reliant on how you can grow attached to these characters, and on that end, I believe Madoka does a poor job at investing me in these girls.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka, as previously mentioned, is our main protagonist for this tale, and is perhaps one of the most boring main characters I\u2019ve seen in a while! She plays the typical cute girl, mainly characterised by her extreme amount of kindness and love for the people around her. Madoka\u2019s character feels more so like a small puppy in regards to the way she was written. She is completely innocent, and is represented more so a victim in the show, with an insane love for everyone, including her family in which the first episode hammers down our throats that she has a happy life filled with love! As such, whenever she does get hurt or abused in the show, it acts as an emotional trigger to make us feel more sympathetic towards her since she is just so innocent and happy! It\u2019s like watching a puppy getting kicked or something, and that is basically Madoka\u2019s character in a nutshell. This doesn\u2019t make her character bad just incredibly dull, and she is easily the least interesting character in the entire show, spending much of her time crying in the narrative. While there is a great scene between her and her badass mother in the final episode, in which we see how strong Madoka\u2019s resolve is to finally put an end to the suffering of the magical girls, her character remains mostly pretty stagnant and uninteresting for the most part, which is even more painful since she is the main character of the entire series! Madoka more so takes a back seat to the rest of the cast and aside from the final episode, contributes very little to the story. I suppose her function in the show is to act as the straight man (I mean woman, don\u2019t want those damn SJWs attacking me for assuming genders!) to the rest of the cast, and thus helping us to relate more to her as a person and to attach ourselves onto her, but I honestly forgot her character even exists half the time.\\n\\n\r\nMami is somewhat more interesting than the aforementioned Madoka but still wrought with problems. She is a senior to that of Sayaka and Madoka and acts as their mentor of sorts during the early parts of the series, and while we do learn something about her character in episode three, whereupon Madoka tells Mami she will always stick with her which brings Mami nothing but joy, and was surprisingly heart-warming to watch, her character doesn\u2019t really go anywhere from that point onward. There are a few subtle hints in the first two episodes that imply some more things about her as a person, but its nothing of any real substantial merit, nor can one truly evaluate her intentions in the early parts of the show as she, let's say, is \"evicted\" early on.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let\u2019s talk about Sayaka, whom is the only character I was actually invested in, aside from Akemi anyway, and her spiral into self-destruction is easily the most interesting aspect of the series for me. Not only that, but her wish actually has some kind of emotional drama, as she uses said wish in order to make her friend, whom has been suffering inside a hospital, good as new once again. As such, Sayaka\u2019s character feels far more grounded than that of the previous two I just talked about, and her downwards spiral into destruction is given enough room to breath and be fully fleshed out, making it all the more hard hitting and impactful. Sayaka\u2019s character made me feel something other than just indifference, and her character is more so indicative of the darker side of magical girls in the series, and the show does a good job at representing this idea. She even embarks on an idealistic battle with another magical girl whom gets introduced in episode five, a girl by the name of Kyouka, and even though this battle of ideologies in regards to their duties as magical girls is as basic as they come, at the very least there is some kind of character conflict going on, and some level of introspection into what it means to be a magical girl to these characters. Kyouka and Sayaka, at first, seemingly dislike each other due to their differences, but the show tries to make them grow into friends over the course of the series, something I could never get behind because it just ended up feeling kind of superficial and it never feels as if the two characters grow to like each other on screen, it\u2019s merely just implied. Kyouka\u2019s character as a whole is just fine, and while we do learn something about her character, and the reasons why she acts the way she does (even if I would argue that her backstory is one in which tries to use emotional manipulation and shock to make us feel for her) at the very least we do learn something about her character, even if her relevancy in the entire narrative is rather minimal, and acts as a sort of mirror to Sayaka\u2019s character, as Kyouka too wished for something that benefitted another, which backfired badly, just as what is happening to Sayaka. It\u2019s nothing amazing, but these two characters do a decent job at making me at least somewhat care for what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally that leaves Akemi, whom I can\u2019t speak too much about since I wish to avoid spoiler as much as possible in this review. Akemi is first presented as being this mysterious figure who lurks in the shadows, with a major hard-on for Madoka, but in episode ten of the show, a whole episode is devoted into fleshing out her character and the reason why her hard-on for Madoka is as big as it is! It\u2019s actually a well-done emotional episode that adds a lot on to her character, and does a good job in explaining why Akemi is as persistent as she is, and I also get a kick out of her using machine guns and grenades when fighting \u2013 it cracks me up every time! \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation and art design, Madoka is great. As expected of both Shaft, and the directing of Akiyuki Shinbou, Madoka\u2019s visuals are unique and extremely experimental, adopting for insane amounts of colour and bizarrely interesting Witch designs, utilising many different animation techniques to make them feel different, but also horrifying in their design. The fact that the Witches are designed and animated differently than that of everything else in the show, gives them this uncanny and monstrous demeanour. The same thing can be said for the character designs too, and how each one of them feels so memorable too me, especially that of Mami\u2019s and Sayaka\u2019s magical girl costume, which I adore. The fight scenes were also a spectacle to behold as well, with great use of movement and fighting choreography, especially during the first fight between Kyouka and Sayaka in episode 5. The whole show is dripping with different animation ideas and art; it\u2019s a feast for the eyes and I love it! The same thing can be said for the music as well, with the opening of the show winning the award for perhaps most misleading opening ever conceived, and one little thing I could admire about the show is how the ending theme changes in episode three, from the sweet and calming melodies prior, to the track called \u201cMagia\u201d in accordance to the shift in tone of the show; a track that\u2019s full of despair! I also adore \u201cSis Puella Magica\u201d with its orchestral arrangements and mystical tone, that fits wonderfully into the show. Everything about Madoka in these two departments is done to great effect, making the show\u2019s music and animation extremely memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Madoka Magica is a fine show. With what it sets out to do and what it accomplishs, I feel it does a good job, and there are many things to praise about the show, from the art and the music, to some of the decently developed characters the narrative presents us with, but ultimately, the biggest drawback is the lack of characters I feel a damn for. Out of the entire cast, the only character I slightly cared about whom may have lived or died was Sayaka and thus, most of the narrative stakes the show presents me with falls flat since I was not invested in any of them. It\u2019s one thing to have narrative stakes and death in the show, but another to have characters whom we care about having those stakes afflicted upon. However, despite all that, Madoka at least remained somewhat fun for much of its duration and at the very least, I\u2019d say it warrants a watch on that end. Just remember, that if a cat offers to forge a contract with you in exchange for a wish, either be smart and wish for more wishes or run the hell away!\\n",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka Magica is an action anime produced by SHAFT. One of the most compelling and interesting stories I have ever experienced in anime. I will be carefully avoiding any revealing of the surprises in the plot of the show, as a result, this post may be very vague.\r\nThe concept of the show is deceptively basic. Various demons, known as witches, exist in the world causing death and despair to anyone they come in contact with. Puella Magi, teenage girls given magical powers and combat abilities, are employed to fight these witches, in exchange for a single wish. What may seem like a standardmagical girl series, quickly becomes an inevitable spiraling journey into darkness for the group of magical girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe central character of the show is Madoka, a teenage girl drawn into the secret life of the Puella magi. The main plot of the show is her contemplation as she decides whether she should join the fight against the witches, which becomes an increasingly complicated decision as more of the secrets behind the origin of the witches and the purpose and fate of the Puella Magi are revealed.\\n\\n\r\nEvery aspect of Puella Magi Madoka Magica is executed with an extremely high level of professionalism. SHAFT are a very original and imaginative anime studio, who have instilled that originality into this series. The magical girl anime genre is usually light and cheerful, SHAFT have taken the genre in a much darker direction, with plenty of death and depression. One of the main themes is inevitability, the Puella Magi are given many different choices and many different paths, but it quickly becomes obvious that they really do not have as much free will as they may think.\\n\\n\r\nSHAFT have an easily identifiable art style, one using many different techniques not entirely common in anime, such as stop motion using various detailed textures. These techniques are used expertly in Puella Magi Madoka Magica to further the dark atmosphere of the scenes in the show, contrasting with the more traditional art styles of the characters in the show, but matching beautifully at the same time. Outside of these original techniques, the standard character art and designs is also of an extremely high level, with the character designs referencing the colour themed characters of standard magical girl series, but toned down slightly to fit the theme. The various backdrops, whether using the standard drawn style or the more standout stop motion style are all exquisitely drawn. The music and sound of the show must also be recognised, furthering the dark mood and setting of the show.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica has an excellent cast, all excellently voiced, each with their own well developed struggles and storylines within the overarching plot. One of the most important things to mention is how realistic the characters are, in how their backstory is developed and how they react to the strange and depressing events. The overall story is bleak and tragic, the characters are developed and identifiable, which only makes their struggles more relatable and ultimately tragic.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is a series every anime fan must watch. Definitely the best anime series so far this year, I will be extremely surprised if any series manages to best it before the end of the year. An extremely original, well written storyline with weighted characters and an interesting and effective art style. Definitely reccomended to everyone, watch this series.",

            "content": "Everyone wants to fix a mistake. \r\nThroughout life they are ever constant. You might\u2019ve messed up your job and gotten fired for the littlest thing, upset someone important, lost a chance to make a new friend, got out of a bad argument with someone close to you, failed a test, hoped you would\u2019ve planned time out better, or faced some sort of intense tragedy. \r\nWhile it\u2019s unlikely that anyone has experienced all of these problems, it is likely to think \u201cif only I could\u201d. It\u2019s the second chance, the renewed opportunity that could ignite a spark in someone\u2019s mind. People want to have faith liferolls their way, so why not take the chance, if only once, to make something so much better? Today\u2019s topic, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, one of the most popular anime this decade, and the anime that personally got me into full time anime watching, takes that upon itself, explore the reach of intense decision making/taking and the caveats of consequence in a form many are all too familiar with, a bright, vibrant and cutesy Magical Girl series. Although the show\u2019s writing tends to go too far in some places and not far enough in others, the endeavor is largely a success.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers for the entire series in review/analysis, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED:\\n\\n\r\nIt starts with 14 year old Madoka Kaname having an apocalyptic yet cryptic dream: a mysterious girl fighting a monster in their ruined city. Madoka lives an ordinary life, until one day, when she meets this mysterious girl in real life, and along with her best friend Sayaka, gets dragged into events beyond their understanding, with them being taught by a veteran warrior named Mami about Magical Girls, and the adorably cute critter Kyubey about having a wish to take. Things might seem simple at first, but in a snap, the straight line changes into an ever growing snowball that puts a lot into the impact of fixing a mistake and consequences to create and result from that.\\n\\n\r\nPeople love to call this show a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d because of the fact that it takes the Magical Girl, something that seemed to be a black and white idea, and flips it on its head by having each girl deal with the consequences and fallback of their wishes, and the ignorance of seeing the world in rainbow colored glasses. In some cases, this excuse is basically used as a standout way to say that it doesn\u2019t fall into the same trappings as what it is subverting, and while occasionally it does, a lot at the beginning and somewhat at the end, the promises and consequences of such are fulfilled to a reasonable degree. \\n\\n\r\nWhile many shows of the Magical Girl genre are known for having atmospheres that are lighthearted, inviting or candy coated, Madoka does a very solid job of building suspense for itself (even when one point is quite literally candy coated). Fear is constructed in three ways, fear of the unknown, fear of the uncanny, and fear of the self. Fear of the Unknown comes from the Witch realms the heroines encounter. Scattered throughout their city, they have a variety of different effects, sometimes can be easy opponents but can at other times appear as tricksters. You never know exactly how these encounters will go down. In addition, the uncanniness of these, as well as different art design choices show how offputting the experiences are for the lead characters. Fear of Self, however, is the most important, I feel. \\n\\n\r\nAs characters confront, succumb to, or release their inner demons, it produces some of the most effective moments in the series. Within this atmosphere, it is inevitable that shock value would sprout. The show is sometimes criticized for using shock value to make you care about characters for the sake of the lulz, but truly, the shock exists for the sake of propelling existing character drama to highs and lows for real impact. Unlike, say, Aldnoah.Zero, where the shock value lacked purpose and was too quickly swept of consequence to my irritation, here, these breaking elements matter.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka is very much revolving around its plot to get characters to provoke reactions at certain times, moreso than some of its older contemporaries like Princess Tutu and Utena, which use character writing a lot more to shape their story. In terms of the plot, the pacing is mostly on point and there\u2019s a certain meticulousness to the overall structure that shows it was very adequately planned. There is barely a whiff of filler, everyone and everything that happens has a point to it. When watching the show, and even more on a possible rewatch, you'll notice a lot of different hints and thematic allusions that may pertain to current plot points, and while a viewer may not think too much of them at first, in the long run, their utilization really pays off for the sake of the narrative. The show toys with a lot of interesting concepts, and generally, I got the feeling that it knew what it was doing, when to properly place its events and why they are concepts originally made elusive to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is less effective is HOW these are conveyed, what they sacrifice, and what they do for the world at large. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who watches the show will be likely to note that Mami Tomoe, one of the main 5 characters of the series, dies after just 3 episodes of screentime. It is only near the end of that time, right before she perishes, that you gain insight to development/backstory to make her more than what she seems as the big sister mentor archetype. To many, this might feel last minute: those not vulnerable to shock value especially likely won\u2019t feel lost weight. However, it serves the plot greatly. It presents doubt to Madoka through a current scenario and the fact that Sayaka does NOT hear Mami say she was putting up a front assists Sayaka\u2019s arc in ways very much like a play, where she ends up believing in a figure that wasn\u2019t entirely real to begin with. And bringing back Mami in episode 10 reinforces the \u201cfront\u201d aspect of Mami\u2019s character even further.\\n\\n\r\nThis happens as well with two of the biggest reveals in Sayaka\u2019s arc. The purpose of Soul Gems, feels very much like overly specific setup to get certain notions in place, and the second involves Hitomi, Madoka and Sayaka's unaware friend, having a desire to want to go to the next level with the boy whom Sayaka accepted the consequences of being a Magical Girl to save. The fact that it was brought up at such a critical point in the corruption of Sayaka\u2019s character can seem forced at times. However, the strength of the consequences feels very much Shakespearean in its execution. If one recalls the ending of the original Little Mermaid (not the Disney film), or Cassius\u2019s fate at the end of Julius Caesar, you come a similar idea here with Sayaka, albeit with less time for it to grow.\\n\r\nNear of the end of the series, Kyubey expositions a CRAP LOAD of information regarding his motivations, entropy, and the past. All done at one time. While you could easily argue this as intentionally disorienting, it still feels like a massive dump of information designed almost specifically for overthinking at the outset. \\n\\n\r\nLess forgivable is the world itself, in 12 episodes we don\u2019t know much about the setting aside from what\u2019s currently presented as a city with Witch holes in it. How are other incubators working, in different parts of the world? Do all cities have Walpurghis naught level monsters? Why do no characters other than Madoka and Kyoko seem to have parents? Why target these characters specifically? Why make only young girls take these contract? It is believable that young girls would be more emotional, and therefore beneficial to Kyubey\u2019s plan, but that aspect isn\u2019t sufficiently explored to the best of the show\u2019s abilities. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, what IS sufficiently explored, as well as the major plot events when looking at Madoka, are given the proper handle. These include: the reaction to Mami\u2019s death, the ever growing uncertainty a wish holds, the characterization and growth of Kyoko Sakura, Sayaka\u2019s corruption, Homura Akemi\u2019s fruitless struggle forcing her to try her damndest to manage emotions, and the meaning of the ending. All of these have satisfyingly emotional payoffs, though I\u2019ll elaborate more on that in the characters section. The writing can sometimes have its problems in a lack of elaboration, some convenient setups or speeding through certain developments, but for most of Madoka\u2019s run, the core ideas of the plot are presented very well.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show aims to dazzle and surprise. Again, compared to Tutu and Utena, it lacks a continuous visual motif (mainly just seems to be \u201cabstract\u201d), and the shot composition isn\u2019t as strong as Studio SHAFT\u2019s other big series at the time Bakemonogatari, but it still is very much impressive. There\u2019s a very nice contrast between the dullness of ordinary life and the wacky, occasionally very shadowed color schemes of the Witch Realms. Each pops in their own way so people can start debates on which Witch Realm is their favorite. Despite what I said about shots, there are still plenty of effective ones without the constant cutting of Bake. A sundown shot of Madoka consulting Homura in particular was a standout. Animation maintained relative consistency and so did the character designs, at least upon my initial viewing in 2014. Sayaka\u2019s design is probably my favorite, most unique of the costumes and the cape sells the \u201chero of justice\u201d angle quite a lot. On the downside, some rooms can look a bit basic or undetailed, especially in the mundane segments and the facial design for some of the characters, mainly Madoka herself, might seem a bit silly looking for the show taking itself very seriously later. Witch realms may hurt some people\u2019s\u2019 eyes, though not my own. In general, very nice SHAFT production, really sells their flair.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajira is fantastic even years later when she\u2019s made several more for series such as Fate/Zero, Sword Art Online and ERASED. The epic tune of Sis Puella Magica does marvels to accentuate the suspense in any given moments, and many of the other songs, from the character themes to the background music work just as well to set the dramatically exciting or tragic vibes. The OP \u201cConnect\u201d may seem ordinary, but by the end, it really \u201cconnects\u201d the show together. The ED, \u201cMagia\u201d, which enters after episode 3, is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve heard, coupled with very nice imagery that serves as proper foreshadowing for plot to come as well. It really sells the tone to dark drama with heavy consequences. Fantastic stuff.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to characters, although in several cases they feel reactive to the plot rather than proactive, or have the foundation of simple traits inherent in the genre, the best of the bunch still have plenty of growth that stems from their existing character arcs, rather than shock value alone.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Kaname is a.....tricky one to talk about. On the one hand, the development she goes through is great, experiencing the tragic events and being put in indecision because of her friends, before becoming more courageous and having a resolve what she believes the right choice for the sake of the world. That growth is well done, and seeing all of the tragic events, it is more than understandable she acts the way she does, constantly thinking about what that one big, mistake shattering wish could be. However, while it is very unique that she\u2019s the LAST character in a series named after her to become a magical girl, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that she spends most of the show being told what to do, being force fed exposition, and crying when bad things happen to her friends. Almost too fitting with the Magical Girl image for most of the run, her personality is borderline basic surrounded by much more interesting faces.\\n\\n\r\nLike her best friend, Sayaka Miki. With episodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 focused on her story, she is the character who gets to shine the most, and is unfortunately, the most unfit to deal with fixing a critical mistake. Early on, she seems to be the more identifiable between her and Madoka, being tomboyish and a bit teasing, but none the less caring and very protective of her best friend, a fairly good role model for young girls. \\n\r\nWhen presented with the opportunity \u201cif only I could fix this critical mistake\u201d, one that haunted her since she was young, she takes it up because of how Mami seems to embody the ease of consequences. As I mentioned in the plot section, it is of critical importance that Mami only revealed her personal weakness to Madoka, because Sayaka goes on believing in a symbol that never was, for a want desperately to be a hero. With so much increasing insecurity, combined with the futility of her current form (being a zombie in a shell), Sayaka finds she can't reconcile her fantasies with reality, as her inspiring motto becomes a dark mantra by the absolute. The drop in mental state can be seen through her battling, starting calming and rhythmic before becoming increasingly reckless, brutal and sickeningly sadistic, greatly conveyed with the stylistic visuals. By the end, this inability to deal with flaws believably breaks her when everything surrounding her ethos collapses in front of her. It\u2019s easy to feel like everything has to go your way, and with all of the circumstances Sayaka\u2019s perfectionism entails, it\u2019s heartbreaking to see what she has to go through and yet, important to learn as well. Determination can be made into a weaknesses, and then, acceptance and acknowledgement makes you stronger than any magic power will ever be, and that, thinking of a future other than her own, lets her die in peace in the end. She gets the bulk of screentime, and thankfully, her transition from a inspired heroine to miserable wreck was presented to enough of a degree to be believable tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nMami.....probably suffers the most from the plot being what drives the characters more than the inverse. She exists to lead Madoka and Sayaka to the world of Magical Girls, but aside from telling Madoka about what ultimately makes her insecure in the end, you learn too little about her to separate her from the \u201ccool big sis mentor\u201d archetype. Aside from constantly ignoring Homura\u2019s advice. Episode 10 helps, but it doesn\u2019t change how little her character got prior to the death that shocked everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Kyoko Sakura is much better. Although, like Mami, she also has a moment where she basically tells another character her history, it isn\u2019t used just as a sendoff, buit rather a way to contrast her past scenario with Sayaka. It\u2019s not quite nihilism, but her character helps to show what living a continued life betrayed by care would result in, for her sake and others who wouldn\u2019t take it following in her footsteps. Kyoko sticks around, at first as a pretty fun rival character with a unique chain spear weapon, but then becomes someone who ultimately empathizes with Sayaka\u2019s attempted hope when it became too late, even with her view tinted thanks to some plot revelations. The attachment, and resolution, feels very sweet in the end, yet satisfying in how it coalesces overtime. \\n\\n\r\nBy far, the most talked about character of the cast is Homura. Homura....Homura...Homura. Many who watch Madoka will often cite Homura\u2019s story as a highlight and despite it not having as much present time to sink in, her story is equally impactful. As we first know Homura, aside from taking a building to the face, she\u2019s the mysterious stoic veteran type who we slowly see more and more of, to learn of time abilities in epic display. Generally, she remains emotionally detached from actions, even when she wants to move events for her benefit. Basically we don\u2019t think too much of her, aside from her words beginning to slowly ring more true. Then....we get episodes 8 and 10. In the former, we see her approach change from ominous forewarning to crying and begging. It seems sudden, why change her approach, does she care that much? Then...episode 10. A very different picture is painted:\\n\r\nA young girl without friends, without purpose, quietly shifting through life until one day when Madoka talks to her. That one interaction, combined with encouragement changes her life. She has friends, a life with purpose, something to look forward to.....until it comes crashing down. A simple thought \u201cif only I could save her\u201d, brings her through time loop after time loop. It seems happy, she gets to be with her friends and becomes capable in the process...but the quest is futile. Every time she tries....failure, failure, failure getting attached to Madoka and friends only to see them die in front of her over and over and over again. The show again shows stubborn determination again sees a weakness and in one loop, she is forced to KILL the friend she loves for her own sake...that shatters it. Don\u2019t let them in, don\u2019t let them see, don\u2019t create unnecessary complications, do it for her, hiding all your care.\\n\r\nHer characterization sheds a new light on all other encounters with her before, giving the series a wonderful heft of rewatch bonus. Talking to Kyoko? In hope for Sayaka to avoid her fate. Telling Madoka not to accept the contract? Hope she\u2019s never have to see her closest friend die fighting. Seeing death before? Yes, many times indeed. But even then, she still can\u2019t take it. Her breakdowns in episodes 8 and 11 feel even worse knowing the circumstances. There are some things you just can\u2019t conceal, it all has to come out, realizing futility is the ultimate pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of the main cast is what we know as Kyubey. In disguise as the cutesy exposition mascot, Kyubey is a character who we don't initially know is an antagonist, someone who appears to be helpful but turns out to be totally cool with leading the girls to their self destruction. His logical demeanor and one focused facial expression contrast well with the volatile emotional reactions of the other characters that follow, and he gives a presence to add to the conversations that isn't directly related to the Magi Quintet, as a communication source to what's outside the immediate situation too. He essentially spurs the drama needed for conflicted character interaction. While over the course of the series, I wanted to kick, burn, strangle and shoot the little cat bunny creature, the way he accomplishes what he does is fairly unique. Almost no conflict that he wants to go his way does he directly take action in. Most of his actions come through half-truths, and spurring on other characters to accomplish certain tasks that benefit his end goal. An end goal for which, he legitimately believes is the best for the universe throughout milennia. Despite the seemingly abrupt and at once moment when he reveals this, the fact that he believed this adds another layer to his character, and to continue an earlier comparison, that anti-villain aspect reminds me of Brutus, also from the Julius Caesar play. Generally he made an interesting source of conflict, and a small bit in the ending even implies he actually got something out of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these six characters, everyone else is mostly a glorified prop. Except for Madoka\u2019s mother, who honestly has a really solid moment confronting her daughter on the necessity of consequences with a bit of a push, for the sake of helping someone. It\u2019s a very well handled scene, and how it follows helps Madoka\u2019s growing character. For everything else though, you\u2019re mostly following the aforementioned six, four of which having really solid characterization and the other two really helping to sell the themes of the plot in exchange for limited personality and screen time. That said, it\u2019s no Baccano, but for 12 episodes, having at least 3 different characters have full arcs is definitely impressive.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, one of the biggest takeaways from the show\u2019s writing is that Madoka is a dramatic romance of characters. The substance is underneath the symbolism and why the character's do certain actions. Why does Mami die? To show Madoka and Sayaka that Magical Girls can die very easily and it's not what they expected. Mami didn't get enough time to really make much of her character, but she played the important role in the girl's character development. The romance of Homura and Madoka is powerful. Homura is literally driving her mind off the deep end, every time she resets the timeline. The love that Kyoko grows for Sayaka is important for Kyoko's character growth. She learns to open herself up to Sayaka, who has become deranged as a result of her own failing relationships with others. And when Sayaka dies and turns into a witch, Kyoko helps Madoka, not because she really cares too much for Madoka, but because she cares about Sayaka. She's fallen in love with her, and now the only person she opened up to is gone. Which is why she allows herself to die along with giving the Witch Sayaka a sweet release from existence as a lich creature.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show reaches its conclusion, there exists elements of tragedy to it, but it is ultimately hopeful. Madoka may be gone, but now Homura is carrying the burden of protecting the world, just what Madoka wanted. Continuing the theme of immense consequence, it presents how in spite of making things slightly better with the girls not becoming their own enemies, deathly consequences, satanic deals and the hypnotic allure of these creatures will always exist. The best people can do is try to live life, work through it and carry on both for their sake and the sake of others close to them. In fact, the entire show effectively uses the concept of mistakes quite well through almost every major character. In her personal journey, we see Madoka understand the toils of the present through the fates of those close to her, while having such a responsibility can be a great burden to bear, how death results from the unexpected and the tragedy of not living up to unrealistic expectations. She learns about the past through Kyubey; in understanding how this cycle, as a flawed system, continued for so long overtime, earnest desires to fix things destroying them. Finally, the future, through how Homura\u2019s efforts literally break apart in front of her, the fact that fate seems continuous, and the fact that there\u2019s nothing at the end of the rainbow the way events are transpiring. All of this kept Madoka\u2019s mind in flux, what makes up the best decision she can think of for the sake of all time, even if it has its own consequences, the ease of mistakes would cause less suffering. And that is what Madoka leaves us with............an appreciation, knowing that in a world full of awful, horrible events that hope is possible even under constant strain. That, is what causes Kyubey to put up some questioning regarding the worth of humanity even under such stressful odds. With Madoka, Urobuchi has used elements of fear, tragedy and powerfully struggling romance to craft this intriguing tale off of something so simple.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nA bit of background here. This was actually the anime that got me into full time anime watching. Yes, THIS anime. I\u2019d vaguely heard of stuff like DBZ and Naruto but knew they were too long to actually start. It was around a time when I was obsessed with essentially \u201cfractured innocence\u201d storylines, and based on what I\u2019d heard, this show had a lot to hide behind it\u2019s cute and cuddly exterior. Thankfully, in watching the series, it really paid off, so much that I got into the real anime medium through it. \\n\r\nTo say Madoka was enjoyable and involving would be an understatement. Despite problems when it came to pacing, worldbuilding, and some contrived setups here or there, I really felt I got to know each girl (except Mami) well enough before their demises. Homura's arc was especially well handled and intertwined with Madoka's arc rather well, Sayaka's arc was an interesting tragic hero arc with an understandable sense of emotional progression and the problem coming from her character flaws of not seeing the harsh truth of her situation, and Kyoko and what becomes of her still makes me cringe (in a bittersweet way). Kyubey, while I hate him, was an effective villain in how purely logical he was, the concept building of how magical girls work was creative, and overall, while it was a deconstruction of magical girl stories at first, it became its own thing for other people to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is not a perfect show, not by any means, and while one could make the argument that being emotionally blinded could cause me to forget about supposed \u201cbigger\u201d problems, I feel like the towering heights the series reached shine bright enough to understate the occasional unsteadiness of its building blocks. With evocative atmosphere, strong character writing when it counted, an interesting take on the idea of understanding past mistakes with heavy consequences, dazzling visuals, an incredible score and a great takeaway message, the show, by itself, stands its ground years later as a beloved popular anime of this decade. \\n",

            "content": "Forget about the whimsy, pleasant, and archetypal mahou shoujo series, Mahou Shoujoi Madoka exemplifies the evolution of \u201cmagical girls\u201d anime. As expected, the plotline involves magic plus transformation, and features school girls with supernatural abilities who are committed to fight evil.  Like any typical mahou shoujo anime, friendship and fulfilling a sole wish are the main reasons why Madoka and the other heroines chose to make a deal with Kyubey to protect humanity. However, don\u2019t be deceived by the emblematic majokko and flashy sweet natured vibe of this series, as there is something apparently dark and serious behind the seemingly generic plot.\r\nIn the beginning,I tried extremely hard to avoid this series, for I\u2019m not fond of fantasy based animes. However, after watching the first episodes of almost half of the new animes, of all, I was taken aback by Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2019s high-quality audio-visual and mind stimulating themes. Truly, nothing is more effective in stealing my attention than the permutation of symmetry, labyrinths, and fractals mixed with evil candy canes, cakes, dollhouses and obscurity. Also, the sensible used of cool soundtracks to soothe the mood, added to the reason why I suddenly found myself considering the plot as a background.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I can\u2019t just simply ignore the plotline. There\u2019s unexpected horrid and mystery behind the relaxed colours and wide-faced characters, which successfully created a positive deception and negated the familiar viewers\u2019 perception about Mahou Shoujo Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, I love how death is used effectively to chain actuality and idealism. It certainly deviates the viewers\u2019 discernment about the show and clearly separates this magical girl series from its predecessors, where usually heroes always escape death\u2014as Gregory House mentioned \u201calmost dying changes nothing, dying changes everything\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, prejudice is detrimental because the series that I tried so hard to disregard is now something that I look forward.",

            "content": "It's not often that the first two minutes of a series give you such a great idea of what to expect, but the now-famous first two minutes of this one pretty much nail it: The young woman walking up the massive staircase of alternating black and white tiles, the heavy steel door that opens into a hellish world of destroyed buildings and smoking ruin, the mysterious raven-haired figure who engages a supernatural monstrosity in futile magical combat, and the orchestral metal song that adds a sense of ominous doom to the entire scenario. It's a suitable introduction for a dark, densely plotted series that throwsconvention to the wind in almost every regard, and explores every theme from the nature of human desire to the karmic balance of emotions in the universe. It screams: Welcome to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Enjoy your stay.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the above described sequence, the series takes on a brief air of normalcy. We're introduced to Kaname Madoka, an average schoolgirl with a loving family and two giggly buddies. During an after-school excursion to the mall, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka wander into a deserted back room where, before their very eyes, the world seems to transform into a nightmare of pulsating walls and evil imp-like creatures. They're summarily rescued by Mami Tomoe, who introduces herself as a \u201cmagical girl.\u201d Mami and a mysterious talking creature named Kyuubey give them a proposition: They too can be turned into magical girls, and in return, Kyuubey will grant them each one wish. However, being a magical girl entails a life of servitude and dangerous combat against \u201cwitches,\u201d shadowy embodiments of human despair and sorrow. The girls are forced to confront their own naivete and meditate deeply on the question: Is there any wish worth risking life and limb for?\\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, the plot evolves into an increasingly complicated web of connections, but it's never confusing, and definitely never boring. Hardly an episode goes by without a major plot twist or a defining character moment, and the show's story moves with breakneck speed as a result. Originally I thought this hectic pacing might be to the dislike of some, but closer examination reveals that there's a careful balance of revealing and reflecting, exposition and action, that serves the show well. Each time a twist appears, there are moments of temporary insanity which are later offset as the characters quietly examine the consequences of their new-found knowledge, and consider how best to respond. The series gives the audience just enough time to inhale a breath before it, once again, plunges head-first into carefully planned madness. There is a feeling of the story being rushed, but this feeling builds deliberately and with purpose as the show hurtles towards its ending; it's a feverish but acceptable pace.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, it's clear after multiple viewings that it took an unfathomable amount of careful planning and deliberation to structure this plot. This series doesn't just have rewatch value, it defines rewatch value. Watching the show a second time armed with knowledge gained from previous viewings reveals just how much careful groundwork is laid in the first six episodes. Conversations can take on an entirely different meaning the second time around, since the viewer is now aware of the developments that lie ahead. Foreshadowing that might not have been understood the first time becomes clear. There's a remarkable amount of cleverness and consistency underscoring almost every aspect of the story. Pay particular attention to the dialogue between Madoka and Homura. You'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, there's hardly a single member of the cast\u2014either main or supporting\u2014who feels unnecessary or lacking. The main characters possess a surprising amount of depth, and the nature of the \u201cmagical girl\u201d agreement in which lives are risked for wishes forces each of them to examine themselves with brutal honesty. There's also a cleverly played comparison and contrast between the veteran magical girls and those who are being asked to join the ranks. The veterans include Homura, the mysterious transfer student who hides deep-seated insecurity behind a cold and emotionless facade; Kyouko, whose fiery temper and self-loathing result from shattered idealism; and Mami, whose easygoing air of confidence conceals an aching loneliness and desire for human contact. Then there are the two girls who are newly propositioned by Kyuubey: Sayaka, a selfless girl whose desire to help others with no regard for her own well-being is more of a fault than a strength, and Madoka, an average girl whose lack of self confidence and inability to think of a wish are mainstays of the plot. It's a unique cast where nobody is quite who they seem to be, and their reasons for hiding themselves and making the choices that they make are revealed in a pacing-appropriate manner as the series progresses. The interactions amongst the veterans, who all have their own personal reasons to fight, are interesting. However, the real character conflict evolves when the newcomers are confronted with the harsh philosophy of their more cynical counterparts: This isn't a fairy tale, and dreams about kindness and helping others are a distraction that could land the magical girls in a grave. This clash of idealism and pragmatism is the source of much of the show's drama. There is an excellent degree of understatement to the character interactions that might not be apparent on the first watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be easy to let the main characters steal the spotlight, but there's also a good cast of support who are deserving of praise on numerous occasions. Madoka's sharp executive mom and caring stay-at-home dad are definitely worth mentioning. Although they're both unaware that their daughter is being propositioned to fight manifestations of human suffering, they inadvertently give Madoka advice that she carefully weighs before making decisions, and therefore play an important role in her development. The only character I might point at as underdeveloped is Hitomi, a friend of Sayaka and Madoka who doesn't have a lot going for her other than being a plot device on a few occasions; her personality seems to take a turn from \u201ccomedic relief\u201d to \u201cdead serious\u201d when it fits the show's needs. Admittedly that's a nitpick. I find it to be forgivable and easily overshadowed by the depth of the cast as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone with time and determination could probably write an extensive dissertation about thematic developments in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, but it's out of the scope of this review, mostly for reasons of length and relevance. Suffice to say that the series touches on a variety of themes that, like the plot twists, are foreshadowed right from the beginning. The two most noticeable themes (in my opinion) were the balance of human emotion in the world, and the nature of human desire and selflessness. The first is touched on at dozens of points throughout the show, with the key question being whether or not one human's happiness always spurs another to be unhappy in an equal quantity. The second is not as clearly visible, but the series seems to be prodding at the question of whether or not people do the right thing because it's right, or because they want to be rewarded. During a memorable discussion in which one of the girls is considering using her wish to help a love interest recover from an illness, another girl asks her: Do you want to help him for his own sake, or because you want him to be grateful to you? These are mature themes that get developed into something genuinely impressive by the end of the series. The dialogue is always surprisingly poignant, and underlined with a note of subtlety. Themes extend directly from the character interactions and plot; the writers are generally careful not to bludgeon the audience with overt philosophical explanations. Many times I think elegant writing of this nature is a lost art, but a series like this always reaffirms its existence. I've mentioned only two core themes. The series is a regular playground for anyone who likes to go in-depth and pick at details, and there are many more that I've sidestepped around, both for the sake of brevity and to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's characters and world were brought to life by Shaft, a studio with a track record of unique and eye-catching visuals. That track record is certainly maintained here. The series is noteworthy not only for its markedly high production values, but for several artistic decisions that accompany its descent into darker material. The magical girls themselves, while undoubtedly well designed, are ultimately  somewhat typical looking\u2014decked out with very ornate jewelry and frilly clothing, as you'd expect magical girls to be. However, the world that Shaft has created is one that changes constantly around them, to the point where they seem to be the only element left standing that isn't horribly warped. The city, which is originally a brightly lit place colored in pastel shades, becomes a dark and rainy slum as the series makes the transition to content of a more grim and revealing nature. The centerpieces of the show's artistic creativity are undoubtedly the labyrinths created by witches when they manifest themselves in the human world. Every witch encounter is animated with a unique and unconventional style; unorthodox art within unorthodox art. One is made up entirely of two dimensional images which form a scrapbook-like affect that resembles a hallucinogenic-induced nightmare. In my personal favorite, the characters and the witch are depicted as black silhouettes on a constantly shifting black-and-white background, with dark red blood from wounds serving as the only other color in the scene. As the series progresses, the witch encounters become increasingly haunting and psychologically grating, and the art direction makes it clear that, to the characters, the witch labyrinths represent a world even more cold and alienating than the one they already inhabit.\\n\\n\r\nWould it be too much to ask for a series with great visuals and a great plot to also have great music? Apparently not, because Madoka Magica is augmented by a strong musical score that is, quite frankly, the perfect icing on this particular cake. The soundtrack is composed by Yuki Kajiura, who had previously created the acclaimed soundtrack for Kara no Kyoukai (among other things) and would later go on to compose a marvelous score for Fate/Zero (among other things). Suffice to say that the word \u201cslacking\u201d does not appear to be in the woman's vocabulary. What's always impressed me the most about Kajiura compositions is the wide range of emotional tones that she can successfully convey with music, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the arsenal of songs written for Madoka Magica. There are lighthearted flute and piano driven melodies for moments of laughter at school, songs spearheaded by upbeat percussion for scenes of rapid action, and weightier orchestral tracks with heartrending string instruments for moments of sadness and reflection. The result is that the music carries the show's unmistakable double hallmark of cuteness and darkness every bit as much as the art. Even the show's opening and ending themes seem designed to reflect the dual nature of the series. The opener, \u201cConnect\u201d by ClariS, is an upbeat J-pop tune. Its counterpart is \u201cMagia\u201d by Kalafina; the ending theme changes several times (each change is a reflection on the tone of the series) but \u201cMagia\u201d is the most prevalent. It's a melodic metal track with heavy lyrical themes that correspond to those of the series. \u201cMagia\u201d also plays as an insert song on several occasions, most notably in the introductory sequence that I mentioned earlier. For me, and probably for many others, the music is a big part of why the series \u201chad me at hello,\u201d so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nFar more than the sum of its parts, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a truly unique and ambitious series that delivers in every regard. There's something here for everyone\u2014action, character-driven drama, a thick plot fraught with conspiracy and revelations, and a myriad of mature themes which are developed so well that most anime can't touch them with the figurative ten foot pole. The only regret I associate with this charming and intelligently written piece of work is that I waited so long to watch it. My only regret after watching it was that I waited so long to watch it again. If you haven't done so already, I suggest you avoid making those same mistakes.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is one of the most overrated anime ever made. Yes, I said it, attack me fanboys! For heavens sake, please stop worshipping this show, it certainly isn't bad but it is not a religion or something. Maybe I sounded a bit salty, excuse me, Madoka (I'm not going to write down the whole name twenty times) is actually a decent, above average anime. But it's not a masterpiece, thanks to plot holes and poorly written characters. If you want to know what's exactly wrong with it, I suggest that you keep reading, if you are a Madoka-fanboy/girl please stay away, Idon't want to hurt your precious feelings. \\n\\n\r\n~story~ 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime is praised by a lot of people for being the first and best deconstruction of the magical girls genre, surprise: it's not! Revolutionary Girl Utena and maybe even Princess Tutu did the same thing long before Madoka was created and they did it better. Why? Because these two series did not only rely on shockfactor and (over the top) drama, like Madoka did. Yes, the plot twist is quite good, but your story is not supposed to rely on one plot twist! And there wasn't any foreshadowing. So even though the plot twist is quite interesting, it's certainly not the best moment in anime history. Also, the drama was a little bit over the top, \"look, everybody suffers\", \"look, everybody suffers more\", \"you're supposed to feel for the characters and cry your eyes out\", \"look even more suffering!\" \"WHY ARE YOU NOT CRYING?!\" Yes, I know it, being a magical girl sucks, but I just didn't care for these characters, because they're so bland. And I'm not going to care for them if you make them suffer more, give them an interesting personality instead.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I got a bit carried away, let's just start with the story: our cute main character Madoka lives an everyday life with her loving family and best friend Sayaka. She and her best friend meet two other girls, Homura and Mami and an cute looking alien called Kyubey. Homura tries to kill Kyubey and Mami protects him and tells our main character that she is a magical girl and made a contract with Kyubey. Apparently if you make a contract with Kyubey, he grants one wish and you become a magical girl. Magical girls have to fight witches to protect other humans. Madoka and Sayaka are quite interested in becoming a magical girl until 'something' happens. After that the darker sides of being a magical girl appear. And what follows is despair, struggling and crying, oh and another plot twist near the end of the story. Of course I'm not going to spoil everything in case you haven't seen Madoka, but this anime is not only known for the cute looking characters..... \\n\\n\r\nOne of problems I had with this anime was the pacing, it starts of very slow but after the first half the story seems really rushed. \\n\r\nAlso, info dumping, Kuybey was supposed to be an emotionless being that did not care about humans, but he starts monologuing out of nowhere to tell the viewers how something works or why. That's really weird because why would he do that? It's not like he cares about the other characters, so why would he tell them random stuff, even if they don't ask for it? It's just a lazy way to explain the viewer what's going on. Also, making important female figures (like Joan of Arc) magical girls was hilarious and really stupid, same thing goes for the idea that the universe can only exist if there is enough teen angst. And my last problem was with the ending, it was weird, not fully explained, but of course a lot of fans loved because it was tragic and sad, and emotions are more important than logic, right? No.\\n\\n\r\nBut the story is not extremely bad, it had epic fights and the psychological problems of the characters were intriguing, though this could have been way better, if there were more episodes and a little bit less over the top drama.\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nIt is interesting, but it wasn't half as good as some fans claim it is. Te story had some serious issues with the pacing and there was just too much drama. Also there was a lot of lazy info dumping and the story relied on 'feels' and plot twists, sadly enough the story was really promising, a shame that it turned out like this. And I really disliked the ending, fusing with the universe, what?! So Urobuchi, I know that you're regarded as one of the best writers in the world of anime, but the writing of your 'masterpiece' is not that good. \\n\\n\r\n~animation~ 8/10\\n\r\nIn loved the art, everything looks cute at first and because of this, the viewers are (even more) shocked when a certain thing happens. The art during the battles was... weird and really awesome, when the characters battle the witches everything looked very bizarre and surreal. The art was really good, though I personally disliked the way the characters looked at first, too cute and their faces looked like blocks. But it works and after a while I got used to it. \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe animation is great, especially during the battles. Though it gives you the feeling like you're on drugs. The character designs were certainly unique but I personally disliked them, but if you watch the show you'll know why the animators used this style.\\n\\n\r\n~sound~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening 'Connect' is a cute song and I understand why the creators decided to use this song. The ending 'Magia' is darker and fits the show better, so I liked the opening and the ending. The OST's were also very good, especially 'Sis Puella Magica'. The background music was used the right way, every song fitted the scene in which it was used. So great job!\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe music was really good, the opening, the ending and the OST's. Also, the voice acting was really good. The music was the best part of this anime (that's not an insult, but a compliment for the music)\\n\\n\r\n~characters~ 3/10\\n\r\nYou could have replaced the main character (Madoka) with a brick and the first 9 episodes would have been exactly the same! Our main character has only one character trait that really stands out: she cries a lot, oh and she has a lot if cheesy lines which she screams at her friends in the most annoying and whiny way possible. The characters were by far the worst part of this anime, our main character is at first plain annoying but it gets even worse, (spoiler) our main character (the whiny little girl) turns into a godlike being and is now part of the universe or something like that.... really creators, really. The other characters aren't that good either, Sayaka is the happy, tomboyish best friend but later turns in a tragic heroine (or that is what she could have been if she wasn't that stupid and cliche) and her friendship with Kyouko is stupid, (\"I want to kill, because lolz\", two days later \"I actually respect you\", a week later \"Let's die for each other\") this is not how friendships work, Kyouko is a just a one dimensional evil girl that gets a sad backstory and also turns into a tragic heroine. And Homura at least gets some proper character development, though a bit over the top (and her friendship/obsession with Madoka is somewhat creepy) oh and they also tried to make her a tragic heroin. Mami wasn't developed at all. There was only one character that interested me, Kyubey. He is quite intriguing, not really evil but not good either. One problem, his logic is really flawed (I have to get witches otherwise the universe is doomed, oh the witches are gone, still no problems with the universe because of plot convenience). All in all, the characters acted stupid. And they are either annoying little girls or a goddess because of weird logic. Also, their psychological problems were not nearly as interesting as they could have been.  \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nOur main character is annoying, weak and stupid during the first 10 episodes and after that she's just weird. Oh and almost everyone was just a stereotype with weird relationships with each other (Sayaka and Kyouko, Homura and Madoka). Kyubey could have been a great villain, but he wasn't thanks to his flawed logic, still he was an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\n~enjoyment~ 7/10\\n\r\nThis is a show about girls fighting witches with all kinds of weird weapons and the world seems to be on drugs, yes this show was enjoyable. But I had the feeling that it started very slow and I was really done with Madoka's crying after the fifth time. As I said before, this show could have been way more interesting if the psychological issues of the characters were handled better. Also during the middle of the show, it got rushed and the pacing was a bit off. But it got really interesting again after the ninth episode.  \\n\r\n[CONCLUSION]\\n\r\nThe battles were really enjoyable, but there were some pacing problems and because of this, the story was rushed and not everything was properly explained. Also some characters (including the main character) were a pain. Because of this the anime wasn't as enjoyable and good as it could have been, this was a pity, because this anime could have been a masterpiece! Still it's enjoyable and an anime that every real anime fan should have seen. I'm not a fan of this anime, but I certainly did not hate it, it was a decent anime, nothing more and nothing less.\\n\r\nPeace!",

            "content": "[Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica - Review]\r\nI was actually afraid to post this review, there are several factors to this. One is that I am not praising Madoka and the other is that I am not destroying. This anime gets pretty into that eight or eighty and I'm a bit beyond that, I would say. I'm in the middle, to tell you the truth.\r\nTo start talking about the anime, there is always that \"blah blah blah, deconstruction\" thing and about this, maybe the anime is not even a deconstruction of Mahou Shoujo and that would not give Madoka any merit in my review. Being a deconstructiveanime is more a form of reputation than a merit that adds quality to the work. Well, is it meritorious to simply kill a character who is fighting evil? I do not see it as a merit that gives quality, really.\\n\\n\r\nProceeding, let's talk about the anime itself, with no escape this time. Soon in the third episode, Madoka shows who he is. Until then, we were not earning much. They introduced the drama of Sayaka, a conflict between Homura and Madoka, or something. With Mami's death, Madoka enters another conflict. It may not seem like it, but all the characters in this anime have some conflict, I find most of them interesting, the point will be the development of these; Sayaka with the boy he loves, Homura with Madoka and the timelines, Madoka with the absence of self-confidence and Mami, Kyoko with the question of sacrifice and Sayaka, there goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterization of their characters is not so great, the anime would benefit much more than three-dimensional characters, but can not do something so close. However, I do not think the Madoka characters are as bad as they claim to be the elitist; they are not inconsistent as I thought they would be. Kyoko is a clear example of a poorly written character by someone who criticizes Madoka. I think she's the best character, honestly. Both in characterization, development and the like. Incidentally, I am very interesting his drama with the main theme of Madoka: the sacrifice for other people, self-sacrifice. She felt that sacrificing herself was stupid because of what she spent sacrificing for her father when she became a magical girl. By identification to the request of Sayaka, she begins to have a drama with the same; not only did he want to kill her as SELFISH, but after he realized that he was no longer who he always wanted to be. The irony and the reason I describe it is simple: Start wanting to help others and when Magic Girl only think of herself, but when meeting Sayaka, change her mind and return to being who she was, to the point of dying for it, better saying, by other people, is great and ironic. By far the most subtle development of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe development of Madoka was very interesting too, it is not part of the premise of being selfish and so do not want to help anyone. She starts from the premise that she is weak and without self-confidence, seeing everything around her going against her to become Magical Girl, but felt that she ought, for a greater good, the self-sacrifice of Madoka, our Goddess. His relationship with Homura is interesting, since Homura begins only wanting to stop her from being a Magical Girl because of all the friendship she had with Madoka, who was sacrificing herself for Madoka at times, suffering and suffering because of it. Madoka was his only reason to live, the only thing he would sacrifice for, after all, he had nothing. I do not like to stop the anime to show it in a filler episode, but it's ok. Until the beginning, Madoka did not know who Homura was, however, when he discovers the weight that Homura carries to save her, he realizes that he has to sacrifice himself for her, not only that, for all that sacrificed for herself. Mami, Homura, Sayaka and a little, Kyoko. One of the best developments too.\\n\\n\r\nBut as not all anime is packed with decent / good characters, you have Sayaka. Her problem is not anti-development, concept, drama, ideas, but execution. The anime insists on showing us how shitty the world is and how useless it was Sayaka's sacrifice by putting a lot of stuff like men talking about what woman is shit on the bus / subway or even her drama with Hitomi and the boy she likes . Honestly, I love the idea, I love Sayaka to the point where they made plot device characters just to make her change her personality. Sayaka's concept is genius, but execution is forced and lazy. The concept is genius at the point where you show how self-sacrifice is bad in some people, even show us that some of these people DO NOT AGAIN the weight of sacrificing themselves for others ... Could be the best character of the work in EVERYTHING , but with its execution, happened to be as bad as the Mami, that is nothing more than plot device.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka's message is good, it's well executed with its exceptions, but there are a few things I should really comment on. Madoka is extremely inorganic and has almost nothing subtle. Everything is played in your cwith exposure and exposure, a few points and there was no need to show. But, this is not so bad in that, if you think of these dialogues as really character action and not mere exposure as in shounens. Dialogues reveal characteristics, dramas or things to the viewer; Madoka goes there and uses it to his advantage. Never, I repeat, never see Madoka without paying attention in the dialogues, they are all important, no matter what, read and reread. Yes, Madoka has some conveniences and even some unfortunate omissions in the script. One of them is Homura not stopping the time to catch the soul of Sayaka and an omission, as an example, would be why Kyubei choose girls to be magical people, the explanation is more omission than anything. Another perhaps more problematic convenience would be that if there are several magical girls in other regions, why only have Kyoko and Homura trying to fight the night of Walpurgis and then only Madoka and Homura? Yes, the Madoka script has its conveniences to work. One point I really do not find interesting in Madoka is the pacing and the time it takes to get things done. So it does not seem subtle to you some developments. They happen very quickly, with the viewer not digesting such changes in the characters, as even Kyoko and Sayaka. They would need more time to develop them, to be more subtle than they were, perhaps as many as 15 episodes. I love Kyubei. Kyubei was a most interesting character throughout my experience with Madoka. Their questioning to humanity is all well done and rational, because this is Kyubei: rational and emotionless, questioning who does things for them, damn emotions. He would never understand humans, he would never understand Madoka and the weight he wanted to carry, because he feels nothing, all the sacrifices he gave them to make were rational. Approaching Sayaka when she most begged for a miracle is an interesting point of view, that he really does everything for his missions. And this is all about Madoka's script, but ... Madoka has another incredible point: Direction, animation and world work (environment). I would say how the Madoka world has been set up with glass rooms, or like when the direction omitted much from this very world to focus only on the characters ... It is a huge immersion. Not to mention the fantastic excitement of Shaft that amazed me watching! That's all for now. Madoka is a decent anime that has its problems in the script, with some characters, but that performs much better in other points of view. It's decent, no big deal and not horrible. Note: 6/10.",

            "content": "Ah, Madoka. A short anime, yet one that seems to have affected many people within such a short time span. I doubt we've seen a magical girl series this talked-about since Sailor Moon. As a magical girl fan since childhood, I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the ever-popular Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\r\nStory \r\nIf you want an anime that sticks firmly to your plot, then Madoka should be right up your alley. It rarely strays from the task at hand, and is always focused on what is happening. There are many plot twists and interesting notes that keep the viewers guessing, and can evenkeep you the edge of your seat. There were some plot twists I admit I guessed already, but you'd be hard pressed to guess them all in this series.\\n\\n\r\nI must also praise Madoka for its pacing. Somehow, everything seems to tie in at the right moments in the series, and it even wraps up nicely in the end. I don't think I've ever seen an anime with every scene so carefully placed then this one.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I was initially attracted to the moe designs. They were really cute, and I was expecting such nice cuteness to develop in the series.\\n\\n\r\nNo dice.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say that that's a negative, because that is actually a plus. Expect a very dark series that uses strange abstract backgrounds to make a scene really pop out at you or even scare you. The \"witches\" are one of the most beautifully detailed parts in the series, as they are where this abstract animation appears. Their worlds are unique to each and every one of them, and it's always interesting to see what trouble they will sprout for the characters next. The animation itself is also fluid and nice. Again, everything seems to be taken care of nicely, thus the studio did a nice job on this front as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that even as I praise what is above, nothing is better than the music in Madoka. From the opening song of the entire anime (which later becomes the ending), \"Magia\", to the emotional opening \"Connect,\" this anime has an amazing soundtrack. There are a lot of pieces that add to the emotional turmoil of the scene, and make a scene like a transformation all the more....\"magical,\" for lack of a better word. If you are on the fence with Madoka, I heavily suggest at least trying it out for its OST. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nAnd with that, the praise train abruptly wrecks, because we are at, in my opinion, what Madoka did the most poorly out of everything in the show. It really is a shame, because I was expecting much more out of the characters, but in the end, they seemed extremely shallow to me and unlikable. And, worst of all, in the center of that is Madoka, herself, who is probably one of the most irritating protagonists I've ever had the treat to watch, and by far the worst character in the show. It's not that her character becomes irritating; in fact, I liked Madoka in the beginning. But I was surprised by how much her character DIDN'T change throughout the series. Until around the second to last episode of the series, she was still \"hunky dory happy sunshine fun times.\" Which I don't usually mind, but this is a series that isn't \"hunky dory happy sunshine fun times.\" Bad things happen to these girls. Often. And you'd expect Madoka's character to harden, and become stronger as a result? No. Instead, she cries and cries in just about every episode after three. Sometimes, MULTIPLE times within an episode. And continues to insist that everyone should have \"peace, love and happiness.\" Yeah okay Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't help it that the rest of the cast is at the same level of unlikeable. All the characters are pretty much cut board cut outs of tropes, but even when they grow past that, it is much too late. I can honestly say I never cared about Sayaka, the reckless hyperactive friend of Madoka, or her storyline; and Homura, the quiet assistant of Madoka, can be irritating in her own ways.  I personally felt like her episode to explain her past came by much too late in the series, as I was already beyond caring. It didn't help that I found her countless \"interruptions\" in fights or important scenes annoying as well (regardless of her powers). The only likable character isn't around long enough for you to develop an attachment to her either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAnd I must say that the characters really dragged down my enjoyment of the series as well, because this show LOVES to take these cutesy characters and do horrible things to them. Thus, when bad things happened, I was pretty indifferent, and didn't really care about it at all. I found myself rushing to the end as well, because I was really ready to be done with this show. This was very disappointing, because the music and story are all well done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nTo throw all these points together, Madoka is a decent show that tries some great new things, but is also in need of improvement. Is it a good show? Definitely. Is it a great show? Er....that one's up for debate.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Madoka's a 6 out of 10 in my book. Good show, but has flaws that took over the enjoyment of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for taking your time to read my review.\\n",

            "content": "**Spoiler Free**\r\nMadoka Magica is great for a magical girl anim\u00e9, but certainly no Stein;s Gate or FMA: Brotherhood. \r\nThe Story (8/10) is where the main issues with the Madoka Magica can be found. The pacing is utterly abysmal. I found myself bored out of my skull for the first 9 episodes. While this issue is certainly not unique to Madoka Magica (Gurren Lagann *cough*) the perceived overall value of the show is far more largely damaged as there are only 12 episodes in the whole thing, meaning that three-quarters of it isn't worth seeing on its own. This said, even I cannot deny that thesudden change in pace (and grand reveals) that take place in the final few episodes of Madoka Magica made the whole experience worth while, if only just.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (9/10) is fascinating - both clean and simple moe and a far more chaotic, collage (similar to that used in Bakemonogatari) styles are used with a good deal of success. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (9/10) was quite well done - the soundtrack is solid and the voice acting (by the end, at least) is believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (8/10) are the other area that could have been much better. While there are some (well, one) characters that one cannot help but fall in love with (or at very least feel incredibly bad for), I couldn't help but hate the self-pitying (and frankly whining) attitude of Madoka herself. It may be said that her character is acting as most would in the situation she finds herself in, but the whining is frankly insufferable. At least in the case of Evangelion's Shinji Ikari he actually takes some action between bouts of his angst. \\n\\n\r\nThe resulting enjoyment was underwhelming for the majority of the series, only a 5/10 at best. The majority of the show was simply too tedious, too slow, and too (seemingly, until the end) pointless. While the impact of this slow buildup is fantastic, there is simply not enough content to justify giving Madoka Magica more than an 8/10 overall.",

            "content": "You'll often hear Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (henceforth referred to as simply \"Madoka\") described as completely revolutionising the Mahou Shoujo - or magical girl - genre of anime. You'll hear people say it \"deconstructs\" the Mahou Shoujo genre. But just how accurate are these statements?\r\nMadoka is different from other Mahou Shoujo. That much is made evident around a quarter of the way in. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows in the Madoka universe - oh no. The true nature of the universe is revealed to us - quite suddenly - as one in which death is a very real possibility; one in which we canexpect the heroines of the show to die. \\n\\n\r\nBut does all this mean that Madoka is a deconstruction of the genre? Heavens no. Sure, we are presented with a universe that is far from the norm of Mahou Shoujo, but it is in no way a deconstruction of the genre. The \"deconstruction\" trope refers to taking apart something (hence the deconstruction) in order to better understand its meaning and relevance to us in reality. Madoka does not deconstruct - merely because there is death does not make it a deconstruction. It does not mean elements of the genre have been laid bare to the rigours of reality. Madoka simply looks at the genre through a different scope.\\n\\n\r\nThe perspective that Madoka is viewed from is, as I have mentioned above, completely different from most Mahou Shoujo. It is darker and there is death. There is quite a heavy focus on the suffering on the heroines. It paints quite  a bleak picture.  But are these elements enough to warrant praise? Does it make the series revolutionary? Does being different really make it good? \\n\\n\r\nOf course not.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka is so often touted as being brilliant because it deconstructs the genre, because it shows the world of Mahou Shoujo from a different scope, or simply because of the twists. Simply put, many see Madoka as being good because it is different - because it subverts cliches and has heroines far different from the norm who have to deal with issues that usually are never explored in the genre. It would be foolish to dismiss the setting as being irrelevant entirely, but the truth is Madoka isn't good because of the fact it's dark. It is good because of how well it was executed.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I mentioned that the fact Madoka was different from other Mahou Shoujo was mentioned around a quarter of the way in? That's important. The dark universe of Madoka is not made immediately obvious to the audience. It completely takes the viewer by surprise, but it's a good kind of surprise - one that was foreshadowed subtly, albeit in a twisted fashion. It doesn't feel cheap. The brilliance of the execution that removed the fa\u00e7ade of innocence from Madoka is twofold - not only does it completely take the viewer by surprise, but the event itself is not an irrelevant one. It serves as a catalyst for much to come in the series. \\n\\n\r\nNo event in Madoka is irrelevant; everything is interrelated, and every event seems to have significance. Nothing seems out of place - it's one concise story that flows well. The audience is kept on their feet; desperate to find out what happens next; desperate to find out how it all ties together. However, this is a double edged sword. This focused and fast-paced storytelling coupled with the fact it is only 12 episodes in length means that some developments are unfortunately rushed - for example, some plot twists come without warning and some characters seem to suffer due to these constraints (notably one of the original trio who seems to have just been cast aside).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are however, for most part, very relevant to the plot, with their problems all tying together. The characters themselves are played quite well, with performances that really do add depth and life to their characters. However, I did not find the characters themselves very interesting - sure, their role in the plot was good, and I liked how their conflicts all seemed to converge, but (to use an example) could the character of Kaname Madoka really be seen as an interesting one? The personalities of certain characters in Madoka could only be described as generic and at times bland. This isn't that big of an issue though, considering the brilliance of Madoka once again lies with how the characters are used. It is their conflicts and their experiences which really adds life to this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe production value of Madoka is for most part quite high. The animation is usually fluid and of a high quality, with fighting scenes and transformation scenes being of a very high quality. There are slight mishaps, but it isn't a big issue. The art style of Madoka can only be described as unique - the faces are really, really wide. I was really impartial to this decision, but I can see how people might dislike this art style. However, even if you dislike the wide faces initially, by the end of the series you probably won't mind them. It really becomes trivial in the grand scheme of things and won't adversely affect your enjoyment of the series at all. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting facet of the art style employed in Madoka was the change in environment to a bizzare, surreal world whenever one of our heroines entered the realm of a Witch (which, if you don't know, are the antagonists of the series). The designs of witches themselves can only be described as bizzare. This is not to say this is a bad thing. The art style allows the viewers to see the contrast between the \"real world\" and the \"Witches' Realm\" - the difference between reality and this seemingly fantasy world; this world that is completely separate from the reality they knew of before - the world where they can get killed.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, with the opening and ending songs providing an interesting contrast between jovial and dark. The use of sound in the series was generally done well - most of the music used was appropriate for the situation.\\n\\n\r\nI found Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica to be an enjoyable ride. Sure, it isn't as revolutionary as many would have you believe, nor does it deconstruct the Mahou Shoujo genre, but it was enjoyable nevertheless. The show is littered with a myriad of symbolism and cryptic messages written in runes, factors that only seem to encourage you to rewatch it. It's definitely a series that I'd recommen and, despite its flaws, is still a brilliantly written series. A must watch.",

Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica quickly captured my interest and had me captivated throughout every episode. \r\nYou may be thinking that this is some 'happy-go-lucky' typical shoujo anime. However, that isn't the case at all. It is dark and twisted, and has unexpected plot twists as well as serious issues.\r\nI was initially shocked by the artwork because it is so unique. Parts of an episode will be in one style of animation while other parts will be different. It is so intriguing to watch the episodes andsee how the animation style reflects the atmosphere and tone of the scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds complimented well to each episode and every scene. It also wasn't just your average sound effects, but there were songs and snippets of melodies and such playing at different times. I normally don't notice the sound too much in an anime, but here, I really did notice the difference and enjoyed the attention to detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all so unique. Each has their own way to fight and for different reasons, even though ultimately they have the same goal. I thought that most of the characters were well-developed. Kyubey caught me off guard, and changed my view of the entire series. It was interesting to see how the relationship between the characters changed because of Puella Magi. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series so much, and I am going to rewatch it very soon. I'm not going to say there weren't flaws in this anime, because with any piece of work there is always going to be something to change.

            "content": "If you had told me a few months ago that a magical girl anime would become one of my favorite shows of all time, I would have laughed at you, slapped you upside your head and then continued to laugh. Don't let that label fool you however, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is not your run-of-the-mill magical girl anime. There have been a few series, such as Nanoha that have gone against the grain in terms of the magical girl genre, but Madoka seriously flipped the script. This ain't no sunshine, happy, cute, fluffy, fuwa fuwa magical girl show meant for little kids. Not by afreakin' long shot. Yeah, you have magical girls fighting witches, but this is not a standard anime from the genre. This is gritty and dark yet enthralling, full of despair and bleakness yet it leaves you full of hope. This is one of the first anime I've seen where forums dealing with speculation were 20 pages long... after three episodes! This is just an amazing anime. I'll break down the grading criteria:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of Madoka is absolutely great. The way it rolls along just keeps you wanting more, guessing more and eagerly awaiting the next episode more. There are times where it's pleasant and nice, where you're smiling watching it. Then, there are times where you feel a deep pity and sadness for some characters or blatant hatred for others. Gen Urobuchi wove this tale intricately but not intricate enough where you're confused. The fact that it's intricate keeps you on your toes and guessing. Plot twists, when inserted in the right place, can make a story much better than it already is. Madoka is chock-full of the well-placed plot twist.  The storyline also flows very well. Some may feel like it builds up slow, but the pace is what creates all of the tension. There will be dissenting opinions on the ending of the story, but in my opinion, it was written and executed in an amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a SHAFT anime, so you should expect ridiculous art. Cotton ball monsters? Yup. Paper layering animation? Yup. Director Akiyuki Shinbou is notorious for this style of art and it's in full effect. It isn't used all the time, but when it is used, boy, it is freakin' used. I personally love it (the art in Bakemonogatari was AMAZING, in my opinion) but others may feel like it's a bit too much at times. The characters were drawn by Ume Aoki (Hidamari Sketch) and I thought that they were drawn beautifully (in a non-attracted-to-2D type of way). A lot of people aren't a big fan of the character designs from Hidamari Sketch, but I love those eyes. Just something about them. Seriously, look for a Madoka pic online and just stare in her eyes. Beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura did an excellent job with the soundtrack of Madoka; some of the music sounds archaic, but bad-ass archaic. It's the type of stuff you want to hear when you're talking about fighting witches. The opening song, \"Connect\" by ClariS, is one of the most played songs on my iTunes. The ending song, \"Magia\" by Kalafina, has grown on me big time. Madoka is a great musical experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and the storyline are the two most important facets to any story, and Madoka pulls through with its cast of characters. You really sympathize for the characters and the pain they go through. The seiyuu (voice actresses/actors) are well-chosen for the characters; it's a pretty renowned cast and they all pull off their roles extremely well. You'll find yourself wanting to scream at Madoka, pull your hair out at Sayaka, cry for Mami, smile at Kyoko and hug Homura. Most of all though, you'll want to kill Kyuubey. See what I mean? You really get the feeling of knowing the characters through their actions and through their progression in the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou'll find yourself at the edge of your seat watching Madoka. It's a ride. A crazy, crazy ride. If you're not coming in with negative expectations, you should have a great time watching it. All the elements of the show come together to really hit you. Whether it's the action, the emotion, the art, the music, the characters or the story that gets you, you'll be enticed by Madoka. I wouldn't mind watching it over and over, just to pick up things I had missed before. I think that this is one of the best anime to come out in a while; hell, I'd say that it has the possibility to be the best show of 2011. It managed to pack an entire warehouse full of epicness in 12 episodes. I recommend Madoka to anyone who is trying to see a \"revolutionary anime\" done right. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica starts off as a show about a schoolgirl Kaname Madoka living a perfectly ordinary life. She has nice parents a younger brother and a few good friends. Everything is perfectly fine until one day she has a magical encounter that changes her life. \r\nThat\u2019s how the show starts, and as the show was suggested to me by a friend whose first recommendation was Another, I was surprised. The show starts off all cute and nice, which was a great surprise, and I found it really strange and quite boring, but I told myself I have to at least try to make itthrough a few episodes. The atmosphere in the show slowly began to change from this blissful school life it started getting darker and darker. It changed from a cutesy lighthearted anime into a psychological thriller.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was great, I found it original and it was never really dragging, but it never got me to feel like I had to watch another episode so it actually took me quite a while to finish it (I watched three other anime in between). The characters were all great, everyone had flashed out backstory. Everyone had believable motivation behind their actions and practically nothing went unexplained in the end. Speaking of the ending like pretty much all 12 episode anime I found it to be a bit rushed but there is are three movies made afterwards that might fix this just like the OVA saved Mirai Nikki's ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I found truly exceptional was the art, it was just beautiful especially the sequences with the witches, which looked like they had just escaped from a surrealist painting. Also the characters all looked amazing and the action sequences looked just perfectly executed. Throughout the episodes it actually managed to keep the whimsical esthetics from the start and managed to make them work in a completely different setting. There is not much to talk about the sound, nothing felt out of place and nothing that great. The opening and ending are good enough to find their way into my iTunes but I won't try to hunt down the whole soundtrack like I did with Noir and Yosuga no Sora. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I found nothing wrong with the Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica I just can't give it more than a low 8 because it never really pulled me in like even the adaptation disaster that is Gokukoku no Brynhildr managed to do. I can fully understand anyone who thinks this is a masterpiece and it is possible I would find it to be one also, had I watched it at a different time. No matter what I still have recommend it to everyone who wants to watch a quality anime.",

            "content": "Madoka Kaname lives as good a life as many adolescent girls go: a well-off home, a wonderful family, and great friends. Then the first-hand revelation of the existence of witches, the fathomless despair they will within their auras, emanated from their so-called labyrinths wherever they pass, and the obligations of those whose duty it is to oppose them. And finally... an offer, a wish. For whatever you ask, would you be willing to make a contract? Would you like to become a magical girl? \r\nProduced by Shaft as its first original anime series, the same studio that brought us the anime adaptations of Sayonara ZetsubouSensei, ef \u2013 a fairy tale of the two, and the monogatari series, Puella Magi, or Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, begins with what appears on the surface to be another typical take on the magical girl genre... one that usually places adversity, action, and fluff, sappy stuff, in the same room. The show, even from the beginning on, begs to differ. It commands us of this: To see what's off color from that strange, ominous dream. To listen to the warnings of that mysterious, yet familiar girl. To be aware. To be ready as plot and character are tested and contorted by this tale from both within and without, from the heights of pre-subversion heaven into the depths of post-subversion hell. It is full of twists and turns meant to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, if not fall off of them altogether. To accomplish these twists and turns successfully, adequate and subtle foreshadowing is imperative. A balance of expectations must be struck: one that could happen rather than should, one that invites shock while warding off suspension. And to the show's merit, with what it did with the first major subversion and beyond, it does that very well. This show is subtleties a plenty that suggest those traumas and horrors, delivered with a certain finesse, letting it all sink in before letting another wham smack you upside the face or double up the gut.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Akiyuki Shinbo's unconventional style of surreal artistry, odd angles, variant lighting, and object placement, alongside allusions to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust not only give audiences something strange, yet innovative and exciting to look at. The standout sight, however, the witches, the familiars, and their lairs, inspired by Russian and Czech animation styles, are thanks to troupe Gekidan InuCurry. They provide the perfect complement, unnerving perversions of innocence, to Script Writer Gen Urobuchi's dark knack for character brutalizations. This is not to say brutalizations are a crucial trait toward excellent storytelling, but Urobuchi's prowess in fingering through bowels make it work in a way as to have either result in screaming in anguish and/or sobbing uncontrollably at and/or on their screens. However, a story cannot hold itself up to scrutiny unless there is more to the content than just subversion, since subversion is a more a means, a device, rather than the end. The end to subversion is a deconstruction, and the end to deconstruction, to the show itself... But what is a deconstruction? What is it besides another means? Deconstruction is a postmodern form of literary analysis that tears into how genre tropes are presented in the story. Fluff, for instance, is one common expression of magical girls, sweet and simple. It's so ubiquitous in magical girl anime that one tends to take it for granted. Yet on whose authority is fluff the end all, be all? Is this all that this genre can amounts to? Deconstruction questions these assumptions through the binary oppositions, or dialectical opposites. What becomes of this is the juxtaposition of fluff with grit and gore. Grim consequences brought to the fore. In addition, new perspectives, interestingly enough, result in further deconstructions of other issues present in the form of philosophical inquiry. What is the nature of warfare? Is there such a thing as altruism? What does it mean to be human? Is hope real?\\n\\n\r\nThese writings are complemented by show's incredibly well done battle sequences, both avoiding the pit-fall of becoming a distraction while serving more than just spectacle. Aside for fan favorite arrays such as \u201cUnlimited Musket Works\u201d (though I happen to be fonder of the RPG and Mortar versions myself), no where is the action shown just for a rise. In fact, Some contribute to that dangerous sense of elation. Others suit the tone of desperation. Still others build heroic defiance.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Shaft's trademark aesthetic is its rather clever and dynamic utilization of OPs and EDs. Minor shifts in detail, choice temporal placements, and, particularly with the EDs, the incorporation of different musics and visuals at the conclusions of fait accompli intervals not only reflect the direction the show is headed. They provide new insights under the lenses of new contexts. Picking directly at the music itself, we have the official OP \u201cConnect\u201d by the female J-Pop idol duo ClariS, which, paralleled with the OP art and animation, provides for primarily the fuzzy feeling one gets with bright lights, energetic hijinks, and happy images. Yet there is foreshadow; subversion, we salute you. The official ED \u201cMagia,\u201d by Yuki Kajiura's band Kalafina, by contrast, follows the show's descent into the dark and disturbing: bleak and steadily blackening backgrounds swallowing the colored silhouettes of characters coupled with those chimes, cymbals, strings, heavy metal, and eerie, eerie chants. Both OP and especially ED, if not for the music, deserve repeated by observant and fanatical fans as they hint at later developments that might not otherwise be appreciable on first watch. The OST, composed by Kajiura itself, is done fittingly within the contexts of characters and scenes as well as on their own merits, whether it be with the intensity of one violin or the epic of an entire orchestra: happy-go-lucky to heart-wrenching, mysterious to evocative, tragic to inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said, the show is not without its flaws. Though I don't have much issue with Shaft and its tendency toward quick vacillations in camera views, peculiar angles of characters within some of the shots, such as the studio's iconic tendency toward head tilts, admittedly, can feel distracting. The Hidamari Sketch character designs by Ume Aoki, for the most part, fit the subversive features. They can also demonstrate, from body language to facial expression, a surprising amount of pathos. However, far distance panoramas can have faces looking somewhat like moe blobs which can take away from the immersion of moments otherwise meant to be taken seriously. The animation is fluid, save for certain parts when much isn't happening on screen, whereby things may feel stilted. Character development is superb throughout, but if complaints are to be had, the introduction to one character's back story felt a bit rushed and unnatural. Another's was hardly touched, though hers worked fine for the purpose that she was set up for while containing a subtle, yet surprising amount of depth. It would just be nice if her background was more thoroughly explored.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless if Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is as revolutionary as Neon Genesis Evangelion was for mecha... Regardless if it is darker than cousins Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha and Princess Tutu... it is nonetheless a piece that deserves a watch, regardless of preconception generated by the genre. After all, it is a human story foremost.\\n\\n\r\nI give Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica a 9 out of 10.",

And now that I've completed it within a day I just have to say: It's a masterpiece.\r\nThe producers take the genre magical girl and create something much more.\r\nIt's an anime full of death, pain, sadness and the question \"What's the value of a single human life?\"\r\nDon't be shocked from the first impression. The anime isn't what he may look like the first time you see it. \r\nTo the art: It's impressive, thegirls themselves look like any girls from another magical girl anime, but the enviroment (especially the other \"world\") looks like it's taken from a newspaper and being put in this anime. The enemies look like from a horror anime or movie as well. When I saw the first witch I knew that I want to watch the anime till the end.\\n\\n\r\nTo the story: I don't want to spoiler anyone so I'll try not to do. Like I said before, it's like a very very dark version of a magical girl anime. The girls have to suffer great physical and even psychological damage through the anime. They have to learn the value of their own and other people's lifes.\\n\\n\r\nTo the sound: I just love the soundtrack chosen for this anime. It's just like the soundtrack in a good horror movie: They chose the right music for the right situation. The only thing I didn't like was the opening, cause because of the opening I thought it would be another crappy anime again.\\n\\n\r\nTo the characters: Well, the only thing I'll give a 9. The characters are well developed, but I think the bound between some of them are too great. Some of them know each other for a month or less and even so they think of each other as good friends. It's a bit too much, but except for this ..the characters are great too.\\n\\n\r\nTo the enjoyment: I watched the anime on one day. I just had too...after the first three episodes I was excited. I really enjoyed it till the very end and I would recommend everyone to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well 10/10 points for sure. I think it's genius to make such a philosophical anime out of a genre like magical girls.",

            "content": "Honestly, I don't understand why people are so in love with this anime. I was made to watch it and it wasn't so bad, so I finished it. That doesn't mean that it was great by any stretch.\r\nLet's start with what was alright in my opinion. The soundtrack was decent and I liked the ending song. The music complimented the story nicely and that's all. The art was also good, especially the backgrounds were very well done.\r\nCharacters - I give them 5/10. They were believable in their behaviour (mostly), but I didn't identify with any of them and their struggles didn't really have any affecton me. Why was that? Probably because of what the story was doing to them. I admit some of them had their cool moments, but there were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nThe story - in my opinion it's above average, but doesn't deserve more than 6/10. The idea to show why becoming magical girl is a very bad choice of future career has its appeal, but the ending totally destroyed it and cheapened the struggles of the characters. Basically, it all was going in a good direction, story-wise, then it seems like the authors decided that the magical girls have to save the world and maybe even the universe, because it's no fun without that. I hated it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - at first there was none on my part, then the middle of the anime was good and interesting, and then the ending, which blew everything out of proportion and ruined the whole experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally I don't watch the magical girls genre, but I heard \"Madoka\" was different. It was, and probably it's very good in comparison to other animes of this genre, but when I don't comapare it to anything, I can give it only 6/10. Above average, thanks to some originality, but nothing great or exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my first review.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica has mistakenly built up a reputation as a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre. This is incorrect, as it is merely a darker take and doesn't really deconstruct anything. \r\nNow that is out of the way; Madoka Magica is a masterpiece in every sense. The story follows the sweet-hearted innocuous Madoka who gets railed into an immensely difficult dilemma. Giving away further information about the plot would further ruin the show, as it is best watched with as little knowledge as possible. However, I noticed I appreciated the show even more upon rewatching it, when I could focus more character interactions and subtle,intelligent details in writing hinting toward key twists, another element Madoka Magica absolutely shines in.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka's distinct character designs by Ume Aoki are immediately recognizable and meaningful. Aoki's expert usage of the color palette and crafting great outfits give all of the characters more personality and further inforces their character. \\n\\n\r\nShaft comes through with their trademark artsy cuts, with what appears to be paper cutouts and menacing color palettes during fights they create uncomfortable fever dream-like backgrounds that heavily contrast with our happy-go-lucky girls. It's despairing and nervous, as they were intended to be.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura is responsible for the original soundtrack; one that heavily incorporates vocal samples and orchestras, setting the tone and following the emotions of the show perfectly. Despairing at times, uplifting at others; the Madoka OST goes through the entire emotional spectrum and makes use of it extremely well. The classic opening, \"Connect\", was provided by ClariS and yet again ties in to the show subtly yet brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka is such a meticulously crafted show where every aspect of it seems to matter. Every character interaction, sentence, events, and even backgrounds give key foreshadowing, rewarding viewers with keen eye, yet it never loses itself in abstractness making it easy to follow. How many unforgettable scenes and how much spectacular character development is packed within its mere 12 episode runtime is second-to-none. Madoka is a masterpiece and one of the best that the anime medium has to offer.",

            "content": "Today, I am deciding to live up to my username. I will review a gloomy anime and l'm gonna give it a gloomy score. Because that's how I roll.\r\nPuella magi Madoka magica! A 'deconstruction' of magical girl genre! \r\nI love it when a fictional work points out what is wrong with itself and love it more when they put logic into themselves. A deconstruction anime should be lots of treat to me! Well... it's not. :(\r\nI didn't really expected much from this show but it still mamaged to be dissapointing. That's got to take some talent.\r\nStarting with the characters! The girls should be at leastworth rooting for, but none of them are to me.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the heroine, Madoka! A very kind and pure girl who is very kind and pure. At the end of the show, she developed into becoming a very kind and pure girl. So basically, Madoka has nothing else in her to be memorable. She didn't even had any development! We saw an alternate version of her who is kickass, yes. But that was not the Madoka that I followed! That is basically just a possibility of what Madoka could be but, it was never her.\\n\r\nMadoka is my definition of a forgettable character.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Sayaka. The tomboy bestfriend. She actually had an interesting development with that musician boy. But it was not fleshed out well for me to care about it that much.  When the guy started hanging out with the green haired bitch, Sayaka instantly became an emo. It was not really convincing. It felt more like, they just made her irrationally emo to get the plot gears grinding.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Mami. The experienced magical girl. When she unexpectedly died (which is a dull surprise for me), I felt nothing. It was quick to forget her. Maybe she just don't have enough charm (like Madoka). She might have worked with everyone else but not for me.\\n\\n\r\nNext again, we have the brash and binge eating Kyoko. Kyoko actually had a very interesting background. But when she died, just like Mami, I felt nothing. I think it's also because like how I felt about Mami. She had no charm at all. Again, this could just be me.\\n\\n\r\nI am now starting to sound like a heartless bitch. But to assure you, I've been sad over a character death many times before. Puella just can't do it to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have Homura... I usually end up liking the stoic and introverted characters. Levi from AoT, L from DN, Garnet from SU, Gogo from BH6, Raven from TT etc... I always thought, maybe it will always be this way? But, I came across many exceptions! Homura is one of them!\\n\r\nHomura is just soooo cold and distant all the time, it was ridiculous. If she had the charm of the characters I mentioned earlier, she could work. But nah.\\n\\n\r\nI keep saying that the characters had no charm. Im beginning to think that its the problem. None of them are etched in my brain. I actually rooted for Kyubey when he was talking about live stock and shit. That was the point I realized, I don't give a damn anymore.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm jumping to the real issue of this show. The fact that it was supposed to be a Deconstruction. First, what is a deconstruction? It happens in fiction when a cliche/ trope is played out like how it will be in real life. And so the question, did puella magi madoka magi do this? Nope. This anime is just unnecessarily tragic and dark.\\n\\n\r\nA deconstruction should be:\\n\r\nOur heroine is just a highschool student! Because she fights monsters all night and studies all day, she is always exhausted. She keeps fucking up her regular life in the process.She felt that being a hero is not fit for her anymore. So the cute guardian decides to pass her job to someone who can handle it, because it makes more sense that way.\\n\\n\r\nSee? I don't even need to kill anyone. Its like the writer of puella just thought that a deconstruction is about spilling blood all over the place. Its not. It should be more than that.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art. It was not very impressive to be honest. The futuristic backgrounds are very stale. The witch realms are just weird. And most of all, I am not a fan of moe character designs. Overly wide head and overly tiny hands. As tiny as a cat's paw! Disney princesses are moe-ish too but they pull it off better.The only saving grace of the show are the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, is fine. It delivered the dark atmosphere that the show needed. I guess its fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Puella magi Madoka magica is a very banal show. Its so baffling to me how this was brillant. But its people's opinions, everyone has their own.",

People were saying \"Yo dude, wait for ep3. That shit is one of most gruesome evil shit bla bla bla\". And what do I get? Dissapoinment. I was like \"eh? That's it? What???\" Enough talking about it.\r\nStory: Story so far is pathetic. Leaked conversation between producers and other people: \r\n\"Let's put some cute girls to make people think show is cute and than add some'dark' moments in the show so everyone will talk about it, cause they will think this was supposed to be cute\"\\n\r\n\"Yeah, let people think it will be the most gruesome thing ever, let them think that hehAHEAHEHAEHH\" \\n\r\n\"Let's kill one of characters that we made up just for that moment with some poor 'witch'\"\\n\r\nAnd so on.... I kept watching only cause it seemed promising cause of people's reviews, but NO, it's bad and you will want to quit after episode 2. I barely managed to watch it till episode 4. I dropped this anime 5 times till then. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, did you ever have an acid trip, or you were bored in class so you started drawing random creepy/dumb things? Well, this is exactly it. Almost got epilepsy and my eyes are hurting as hell. Not to mention that characters look like a fucking plate. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well, this is only thing I kinda liked in this show. Only outro, cause it sounded nice with good rhythm, but lyrics are bad, so it's 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is one of the worst characters I ever saw with no character development or anything. Just girls randomly talking and \"killing witches\". Not to mention putting a supportive character just so you could kill it and change the main character's mind and will. And there is that one character (I even forgot her name) that is childish, playing hot and cold games, like \"Oh I see you 2 together talking so that means you love each other and now I will run away so you will feel sorry for me.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I said I dropped this anime 5 times till finishing episode 4, and even the strongest wall can break sometimes, so I quit. I got so surprised at how boring and dumb this overrated anime was, so I had to write this review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was one of the worst show I ever saw, cause of influence of everybody saying \"Yo look at this shit, it's lit/bad/evil/cute...\"\\n\r\nNO, just no. You will just waste your time if you start watching this. This is how I learned to never trust people on internet talking about which anime is good and which isn't.",

            "content": "Here\u2019s my review of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica\u2026 of the 200 or so that are out there.\r\nThe anime is rated by the MAL criteria in the bottom of this review. Because countless top-rated reviews have already provided this information exhaustively, I believe my opinion about why \u201cMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is worth the watch\u201d would be more interesting than reading the same information over and over.\r\nWhy \u201cMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?\u201d (Top 3 reasons)\r\n1) Gen Urobuchi: He was the writer for many highly rated anime out there: Fate/Zero, Black Lagoon, Psycho-Pass, and Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. If you\u2019re like me, watching a memorable anime motivatesme to look out for more works done by the same writer. Therefore, I recommend this anime if you have already watched and liked any of the anime listed above.\\n\\n\r\n2) The Tip of the Iceberg: There was more depth to this anime than meets the eye. At first, I was completely bewildered by the ending of this anime. The episodes that came beforehand were fine, but out of all the anime that I watched, the ending of this anime did not seem to add up at all -- I felt that there were so many questions left unanswered and that the last episode was unsuccessfully trying to cram everything into one episode. \\n\\n\r\nI was terribly mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nI was so used to explanations being spoon-fed to me that it never occurred to me to think for once. I eventually resorted to researching, after coming up with my own theories and explanations. In the end, I realized how brilliant the ending actually was and everything made so much more sense. No doubt, I still had questions and I still found inconsistencies (I\u2019d be more than willing to discuss with anyone), but Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica managed to do a better job of closing off the anime than I first thought. The challenge of trying to understand the writer\u2019s intentions was somewhat of a first for me, since most anime have simple plot lines and somewhat predictable endings. Therefore, I recommend this anime if you like an anime that makes you think.\\n\\n\r\n3) \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d I have to mention this aspect of the anime, even if everyone else has already written about it. The surprisingly dark twist on the idea of a \u201cmagic girl\u201d is what initially drew me into the series. The contract that the girls make to become \u201cmagic girls\u201d is actually quite deceptive. On the surface, the deal is as good as it sounds. The girls can have one wish granted, as long as they risk their lives to fighting off witches. Since the girls receive awesome magic powers in addition to getting their individual wishes granted, this deal sounds like a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation for the girls, right? Not really. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but I will say that this anime is very dark and somewhat depressing even. I recommend this anime for anyone who is jaded from the typical \u201cmagic girl\u201d anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on the life of the young schoolgirl Kaname Madoka. She is shy, humble, and most all, kind-hearted to a fault. She lives with a loving family and a group of friends that she treasures equally as much. She\u2019s not particularly talented at anything, a fact that initially draws her into becoming a \u201cmagical girl,\u201d because she believes even she can do something to protect her loved ones. Not much else can be said without spoiling the first two episodes or so, but basically the world is filled with \u201cmagical girls\u201d that hunt witches that curse human beings into committing suicide or other unworldly deaths. The anime focuses on the decision of becoming a \u201cmagical girl\u201d and explores the various consequences that come along with it. The dark twist that the anime takes on the \u201cmagical girls\u201d trope, the tense emotions, and the plot twist elements are what gives this story a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI would rate the art higher only because of the unique style of animation when the girls fight witches. The witches are depicted as moving pieces of abstract art, as well as the world in which they occupy. This emphasizes the distortion of the witch\u2019s moral values as well as their chaotic and inhuman state of mind. The art used to depict these witches and their worlds are beautifully tragic, and you\u2019ll see why as you keep watching. This choice of animation will always remain in my memories as one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of how the characters are depicted. I feel that the \u201cmagical girl\u201d costumes were too generic and simple (not to mention how they were mostly single-colored). The facial features of the girls seem way to simplistic for my taste, because they make all the characters look way too young. In addition, the animation that girls go through as they \u201ctransform\u201d into the \u201cmagical girl\u201d clothes seem very unnecessary, because these animations were very short, inconsistent, and hardly memorable. Besides the character depiction, however, the fighting animation is very fluid and well-done. What I dislike about the character\u2019s features is counteracted by the many epic fights that occur throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say much about the scenery, but I can say that there are many dark colored backgrounds. The glaze of gray and black adds to the darkness of the situation and goes with the intense mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me about the soundtrack of this anime was how epic and well-made it was. The ending song \u201cMagia\u201d is very dark and intense. There are not many cheery type of music, and most of them help to amplify the tension and the atmosphere of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses mainly on five characters, but 12 episodes are not quite enough to develop all of them (I felt as though some characters were neglected). The viewers are introduced to the background of the characters and their motivations to becoming \u201cmagical girls,\u201d motivations that are very much relatable and understandable. There will definitely be some characters you will be emotionally attached to by the end of this anime. Despite the short amount of episodes, however, this anime did a decent job of developing these characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series a lot and it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole marathon of watching this series. \\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "First a clarification, this review will be about the series Madoka Magica, its continuations the movie mahou shoujo madoka magica rebellion, and its recap movies (cashgrabs) will not be considered or discussed in this evaluation. And no, this review is not in any segment or paragraph spoiler free, so be warned when reading.\r\nDespite this not being a method I really like to use, I feel obliged to start my analysis exploring the concept that no one can shut up about when discussing this, yes the fact of whether madoka is a deconstruction, or not of the mahou shoujo genre, for it apparently containing an entirelynew perspective on the genre. One of the reasons for the series to be perceived in that way, is mostly due to the lack of knowledge of most anime fans, darker and more dramatic takes on mahout shoujo trappings are common since the times of uta-kata or princess tutu. Mahou shoujo is way more diverse, and madoka differs way less from it, than a fan that has only seen a few shows kind that can imagine (and yes there are lunatics that have only seen one mahou shoujo, madoka, and still claim the series is a deconstruction). But no, the concept of madoka being a deconstruction is not only based on its unusual tone, but in the idea of it actually containing lots of commentary, about the mahou shoujo genre. Aspects like the action in such series being unrealistic, and would demand way too much of the human body to be feasible, the innocence of supposing that girls in this kind of situation would simply join due to the presence of a common enemy, character deaths being a common reality in this story, just to name a few. Madoka is taking a few elements people take for granted, and applying what could be said as a more realistic logic to them, having this as a way to comment on the genre\u2019s nature. The problem in here is the content itself, what Madoka is actually saying about the genre with this, basically the series is using the commentary I explained above just to talk about how unrealistic each said aspects are. But verisimilitude with reality is not, and should never be the objective of any fictional story. The girls on those kind of plots join and have power of friendship to triumph over everything, not because of how much sense that makes realistically speaking, but because such elements are part of the socially important message those series are trying to pass on to younger audiences. When replacing those aspects for selfish heroes the series is in effect losing the messages which give meaning and purpose to the genre and its architypes. This is the issue I take with most of the so called deconstructions, they usually are works so eager in criticizing genres, to portray its meaning as hopeless idealism, but at the same time they construct nothing, no new coherent ideology in response to them. It just ends up amounting to a fake realism. They point out clich\u00e9s but fail to recognize that making a story where the heroes always lose, is as predictable and unrealistic as one where the heroes always win. Only portraying the other extreme, the cynical, the immoral, the despair does not make such works any real representation of reality. If madoka fallen to such trappings, my verdict on the theming and meta aspects of the show would be pretty negative, but happily that is not the case, and this is where madoka simply brilliant ending comes into play. When all hope seems to be lost, to the point where simply having hope would mean a flaw in character, when it seems the whole series is engulfed in its own cynicism. Than we have the last episode making an unbelievable turn, hope is reaffirmed through a wish, the uselessness of practicing good, because due to the entropy that could only lead to an equal amount of suffering being done, is contested. The universal rules this perverse system that seems to deny everything to individuals is changed by said wish. Madoka in its last act reconstructs and reaffirms ideals that form the genre, the idealism destroying the own cynical setting the series builds up, following the simplest format of all, of the hero that by making a choice and having personal sacrifices, escapes and subverts a pervert system of control. The template for mahou shoujo is the result of that, reappearing here, at the series last moments. To conclude, I am not sure if what madoka is doing is actually a deconstruction or not (to be sincere I do not really care that is the case or not) but what madoka does efficiently has to explore about the mahou shoujo genre, is interesting to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nI have Always considered myself a big fan of Akiyuki Shinbou style of directing (despite never being sure, he is the actually directing some of the shows he is credited to).  Despite the variables levels of quality of a lot of projects he seems to be attached to, in each one of them I can safely say, the directing really added a lot to the experience. His style of directing may not be as artistic as something like what Kubrick usually did, where the directing itself and usage of symbolism are used to strengthen themes, and make complex really subtle points about the work, his style is marked for being really accessible and even so extremely memorable. The show tries in every regard to be visually stimulating, every scene, be it for the imagination and creativity presented in the designs, scenarios, location mapping, the usage of color pallet, backgrounds, everything in the series shows this attention to detail and creativity. Every Witch liar has a completely different form of being presented, and the forms of physical combat are among the most creative I have seen in anime. I have to point how not a lot of the directing or the detailed production is purposed to reinforce the series themes, but the effort and passion demonstrated are certainly praiseworthy. \\n\\n\r\nAn important element, I would like to present a defense towards, are the characters. Sure madoka may not have the most interesting and complex characters in the world, and I am not sure if there was a way to make really great characters of a really plot focused 12-episode series. But claiming as a lot of people do, that the series characters are empty puppets for the ideas and history, goes beyond overkill. Take Madoka the protagonist for example, her way of acting and thinking are completely understandable, her low self-esteem due to her lack of capacity of seeing merit in the things she was able to do (it would have been great if that trait did not need to be repeated 15 times), as such low self-esteem is her motivation for a dangerous altruism, leading her to want to make good things for others even when those actions mean prejudice for herself. Her insecurity and hesitation in regards to her wish are also perfectly understandable, due to the almost no way out situation, in which she is being forced to make that decision. This tendency marks madoka\u2019s characters, they have simple personalities, that are easy to understand and sympathize, and their actions are coherent with the form they are written and their ideals. One character that negatively stands out for not being that way is Sakura Kyouko, her character and arc simply do not work. The establishment is relatively well done.  First we are presented to her and steadily her character is demonstrated through her actions, her individualistic mentality, when allowing that other humans may come to die, just to assure she will have more grief seeds, and for actively trying to take away the territory of another mahou shoujo, by force.  Later we find out her past, the fact she inadvertently has caused the destruction of her entire family, because of a wish she made judging it would help her dad, and how those elements explain the mentality she displays nowadays. All of this is shown in a short amount of time, but establishes her really well as a narcissistic asshole. And then what happens? Later she simply changes her mind, after a 5-minute conversation with Sayaka and starts to worry enough about her, to even sacrifice her life to save Sayaka. This change is not only sudden, she is also awfully explained, I do understand the fact of she forming a form of identification with Sayaka, because the two of them are suffering the shock of really awful reveals, that change completely the way that they see themselves. But from that, to there actually being this great connection between the two that justifies said actions, there is a great difference. The character development in this case, consists of convenient writing, that ignores previously stablished character aspects, just for the story progression, that needs Homura to face the Walpurgis Night alone. On a certain way it is way worse than Mami\u2019s characters that has a more simplified development and arc, while still being coherent, due to her minor importance in the history. So in general the madoka\u2019s cast is mediocre to ok, the characters do their job, and do not really deserve a lot of the backlash.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more prominent themes in Madoka is the dichotomy and clash between altruism and egoism. Which one those two concepts rules, or should rule our actions is extremely relevant for the series, having every character show a unique point about that. Sakura Kyouko being the most emblematic example, since her introduction her character is defined by her egotism, and for giving absolutely no value to helping others. Those characteristics are the result of her troubling past, especially the idea of it being useless to try to do good things for others, because of our lack of capacity of understanding and really managing to enact good acts for them. The series answer for that is bringing the same logic for her own egotism, Kyouko on her own vision may be thinking she is acting according to what is best for her, but she finds herself unable to comprehend her situation, which in turn makes her incapable of realizing what is actually beneficial. In the other side of the spectrum we have Sayaka, always acting for the good of others, feeling disgusted to even imagine of taking personal gain with the situation. The character due to the loss of her body, starts to only define her value by measuring how useful she can be for others. This excessive altruism is the reason for her fall, after placing the value of her existence only on how useful she could be, when she starts having doubts on the society she is trying to protect, Sayaka is left with nothing becoming engulfed in complete despair. Homura is an odd case since her actions seem to be altruistic in a first glance, after all her motivation is the love she fells towards Madoka, but such love is essentially selfish. She wants to save Madoka only, not worrying with anything else, like other people, how they may see her, the broader situation, and being because of that incapable to solve the situation. The ending portrays a synthesis of both concepts, sure Madoka\u2019s sacrifice may be the utmost representation of selflessness in the series, but that is only possible due to Homura\u2019s egotism. The union of both, egoism and altruism is the answer, both are important sources to guide our actions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother remarkable aspect of this work are some of the sources it takes influence from, especially two great literary authors. Goethe is the most obvious, madoka raises a lot of the same questioning that are in the center of his reputed work Faust, some witch\u2019s lair even containing direct visual references to that. And it is not hard to understand why that is the case, both works focus on human beings trying to enact impossible or almost impossible feats, through short cuts without putting the necessary effort. In this process the characters lose their humanity and souls, to see their desires come true. The message is also pretty similar; be careful with what you wish for. Kyuubei is also kind of reminiscent of the charismatic devil offering temptation to humans, and portraying an even understandable perspective for the audience. H.P Lovecraft, probably the most influential figure on terror as a literary genre, being another. Gen Urobuchi is in my opinion trying to recreate the existential horror that Lovecraft\u2019s works contain, the idea of the incubators being extremely reminiscent of the Cthulhu, this supernatural being that inflict terror on the characters, this mysterious being that gives no importance or value to human kind.  The key differences are in the form both beings are portrayed, Kyuubie has motivations, methods and objectives explained in the series, the figures of horror in Lovecraft\u2019s books on the other hand have pretty much everything about them involved in mystery, the mentality of those creatures cannot be understood for human beings and trying can only lead the individual to madness. Theoretically having said aspects explained would be a point in favor of madoka, but that is the deal. The horror in those histories comes from our lack of capacity to really know, of there being these incomprehensible horrors, which you cannot understand or predict. Giving answers and demystifying said beings only makes them less scary or threatening. This is one of the cases where raising questions and intrigue means way more for a work than any answer and explanation. If you view Madoka as an attempt in existential horror, it simply does not work on that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative quality of Madoka also cannot be understated. I have already seen people referring to this series as the one that has perfect story\u2019s pacing, and despite not agreeing with the sentiment, I really get the why. The narrative structure of madoka works really well, containing a healthy number of twists and revelations spaced out excellently. Having each one the twists fulfilling an important function in the narrative and in the character\u2019s arcs, by changing the character\u2019s perception of themselves or the reality they are inserted. Between those revelations the series never stops paying attention to how each character is being affected, how they react to the new events and reality. This constantly changing and evolving style of narrative makes madoka one of the more addictive experiences I have ever had with anime. Sure there is a degree of convenience involved here, I will always find hilarious how Homura is always getting late or in the nick of time in several events, even when she has the capacity of moving infinitely faster, than other characters.  But there is nothing that really hurts the series internal logic to a high degree, or really represents important structural problems in the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up, as I rewatched madoka I gained a deeper appreciation for the anime. I managed to comprehend what the series is trying to do, and what is the point it trying to make with its aspects.  While not always being that successful in those, it is overall doing a good job in its diverse aspects. I may not believe it will ever be a masterpiece in my eyes, mostly because of the characters, which I never managed to form a connection or caring that much about. Moments of intense emotional turmoil like those Madoka and Sayaka went through barely affecting me. But still I got a satisfying experience of the whole thing.\\n",

            "content": "When I first came across Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica I expected something that was light and fluffy (I did watch the series when it first started) but what I got was completely different. Everything came as a surprise and that's what really kept me watching. \r\nIt starts out like a regular magical girl anime, fighting enemies, collecting their droppings (yes that's what I like to call them), but then everything takes a turn.  The atmosphere becomes dark as we watch the hardships each character goes through. While all this takes place, we, the viewers, also learn what is really going on.  After a turnof unpredictable events we reach an exciting climax and then given a somewhat conclusive ending\\n\\n\r\nUsually the pacing is a problem in a 12 or 13 episode series, but not in this case.  Every episode does contribute to the story and the it never seems like the story is being dragged.  Pacing is part of the reason to why the series gets such a good reception, because if the series had horrendous pacing, the series would get boring at some points and super confusing at others no matter how good the story is\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason to why the series is fantastic is because of the unpredictable twists.  The anime is actually an original (as in not an adaption), so no one knew what happened next. A lot of the events that advance the plot are really unpredictable. It always surprises us which keeps us watching.  Also for the majority of the series, we are not given the full picture.  So it also keeps us watching as the events piece the picture together. The series also managed have a conclusive ending unlike many others today, which leaves the series up in the air.\\n\\n\r\nAs the idea itself, it's also another strong point but I wouldn't say it's a first. The reason being that there are countless series out there and I'm sure there is a number of them had a similar premise.  However since there is a large amount of series out there it is very difficult to come up with something totally unique.  Also the combination of genres really isn't the first thing that comes to mind.  So I applaud the series for going for something different.  The idea was also executed really well which plays a major role in how good the series is.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also character driven and the characters usually spark events that happen. All the characters have their time in the spotlight and each are more complex then what they appear to be.  Each character undergoes development and each one is explored in depth as we watch the hardships each one has to go through. We also have Kyuubey, who some may consider the antagonist of the show.  Although he has no emotions or moral values, the reason why he does what he does, seems logical.  There's thought put into each character but the behavior of the characters can be a strange at times and the development of each is a bit rushed but the characters were done really well nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nAs many of you know, the producers of the series was SHAFT so I was expecting another series with unique art.  The normal world is slightly futuristic and is drawn fairly well. However when we get to the world with witches the entire style changes.  Everything becomes very abstract and it helps set up the atmosphere of the series\\n\\n\r\nSound isn't really something I pay attention to.  However I did notice that ClairS did the opening which actually creates the illusion that the series would be something very light. The ending is a much different story, unlike the opening it matches the atmosphere the series and I feel that it fit perfectly. The cast has some well known voice actors and they all match their character, they also voice the characters' emotions quite well.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the series when it first started so the hype didn't really effect me as a viewer.  However with all the hype around, I feel like enjoying the series might be harder. The reason is when I came in I had no expectations so it was a pleasant surprise to see how good the series turned out.  But when there is a lot of hype, a viewer tends to come in with expectations which are through the roof.  Also when there's a lot of hype, I find that people tend to have a negative mindset because it's almost as if they are being forced to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica was really enjoyable due to all the unpredictable events that happened, it always had you guessing. The pacing also played a role in enjoyment because it ensured that it never got boring since everything that the show presented relevant.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is certainly making it's case for anime of the year and it has set the bar pretty high. It just goes to show that a well written, well paced story with a twist can still get pretty far.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Are you looking for a magical girl series filled with happiness and joy? Well, then you are looking in the wrong place. I watched the opening. The word dark was pushed into the back of my mind. I watched the first episode-I didn't expect much from the anime. But later, I included Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica in my ''favorite'' list.\r\nThis whole anime starts by showing Madoka running across a dark room and seeing a girl struggling. She wakes up after being told that she can save her. But then someone transfers to their school. Madoka thinks she is the same girl in her dream. Thestory is told in a slow pace, gradually showing hints that it's going to be dark. You'd need to watch every episode to understand what was going on. I think part of the reason why I gave the story a 10 is because it is not very easy to understand if you don't pay attention to the story.The thing that bothered me in this anime was that the ending didn't make much sense to me. I want to write this review without any spoilers, so I'm not going to write about what confused me. But if you watched the end, you'd see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is very unique. First, you think it's a happy-go-lucky anime, and...SNAP! Everything changes into a dark anime with very few comedy scenes. This is also why I gave the story a 10. You can always receive a surprise from this anime. The pacing is excellent too. I was always excited to watch the next episode. The first episode is very welcoming, showing events that will continue the story. The owners of this anime planned this anime very well and carefully, so we can watch an anime filled with excitement.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was very satisfying to me. There were a few plot holes, which bothered me a little, but other than that everything was explained. The ending concluded everything, but it leaves the audience would want more episodes, which is also why I gave this anime an extra point. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is developed by Shaft. I liked the character's ''wide face'' feature. It makes them look cute, which is needed for a magical girl anime. The director wanted you to think it was going to be a cute anime full of smiles, because of Madoka's cute and chubby face. Many people were fooled by this feature. I don't think the character's art styles are fitting for the story. If I knew what this anime was about before I watched it, I'd expect the art to be realistic, like Death Note. The witches are a totally  different story, though. Some may look cute (like Charlotte) but some may look scary and gross. I think every design matches the character's personality well, like Kyouko's red hair represents her fiery personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are very well drawn. I like the backgrounds when they are fighting witches. You can tell what the witch is going to be like by looking at them. The backgrounds are usually food or plants, but there are other kinds. The transformations are also superb. Unlike animations like Mermaid Melody, the transformations are very short but still enjoyable. I like how the background in the transformations also show the magical girl's personality, like how you can see music notes in one transformation because she likes music.\\n\\n\r\nThe eyes of the characters look very similar, but other than that, they look very different. This did not give the plot away, because I didn't see any characters that looked very dark and scary (except for the witches). By this smart plan, you wouldn't expect anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was composed by Yuki Kajiura. The music is for dark anime, suitable for anime like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I would listen to the music again one day, because they are very well played. My second favorite song from this anime is the ending song. It is actually so epic that they sometimes use it in battle scenes. The ending VIDEO isn't very epic though. It only shows Madoka walking past everyone. I kind of wish they made it more interesting. However, the opening is a different story. The opening is called ''Connect,'' by ClariS. It basically shows WHAT the anime would be like if it wasn't dark. It's the biggest lie ever. So I'm not very fond of the opening, but it is still enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have special traits or their own, making them unique and different. They react to situations and events in a realistic way. The supporting cast was useful in the anime, but there were so little that I thought there weren't a supporting cast at all. I think there were too little people in the supporting cast. But still, I would remember these characters in the future because they have a special meaning for me. My favorite character is probably Kyouko. She is very headstrong, and she matches my personality. I believe the staff wanted us to like Kyouko on purpose because they want us to have a little surprise after some episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters do not grow in age throughout the series- they grow in a special way, like how a character became wise. This usually happens in dark anime. \\n\\n\r\nOther than all of that, people will like this anime because it is filled with excitement. Even non-anime fans would like this work because this anime has a special meaning for everyone- and the meanings are all different. I would re-watch this work in the future. This would still make me excited even if I know what will happen. I think re-watching would add to my enjoyment of this series becuase I would understand things I didn't understand when I first watched this. This masterpiece is so enjoyable that you would remember it for years.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to people who like dark anime. Do NOT judge this by the picture. This anime is not for kids-it's for matured teenagers. It's even rated R. It is darker than you can imagine. Even if it sounds girly, this anime is superb. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Madoka Magica was hyped as the ultimate deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Not only that, but one of the best deconstructions to date. Its name carries a lot of weight with anime fans, and is often brought up when talking about great anime from this decade. I went into Madoka Magica expecting greatness; however, only mastering its goal wasn't enough to illustrate a true masterpiece. \r\n   The story starts out extremely slow and confusing and becomes predictable over time. It being called a deconstruction is a giant spoiler tag for me, as I can see what to expect. Ifyou go on the premise of a normal magical girl show, the plot will seem overly dark and brilliant in some eyes. This was not the case with me, as I only became interested in the plot around episode 9+. The story wasn't that dark, and became similar to a classic thriller, giving immediate signs of following a similar formula. \\n\\n\r\n   Shaft's animation quality was great, but the art style itself was unappealing in my eyes. The characters seemed bland and uninteresting, as well as the abstract enemies and backdrops portrayed throughout. The sound was top notch, not the best soundtrack, but not far off from perfect for this show. \\n\\n\r\n   The characters in Madoka Magica are easy to sympathize with and intriguing in their own rights; nonetheless, they're not perfect and their natures are distinguished early on. Each girl's personality is revealed early on, and with past examples of similar characters, they're, again, predictable. \\n\\n\r\n   Overall, I did not enjoy watching Madoka Magica; however, I still see it as a good, well rounded anime and an amazing example of a deconstruction. I give Madoka a good 7/10 and a recommendation for anyone                                          who likes thrillers or unique art styles to watch it immediately, or if anyone want's THE deconstruction of the magical girl genre.",

            "content": "Of all the genres in anime, there are few as innocent and as light as the magical girl genre. It is usually by default that audiences expect the same old concept of the young, optimistic heroine who harnesses some sort of magical power given to her to battle evil forces in the name of justice. So to those unfamiliar with director Akiyuki Shinbo and writer Urobuchi Gen, Puella Magi Madoka Magica must have come with quite a shock.\r\nWhile there certainly have been magical girl shows that have taken a darker focus in the past, none so far have been able to deconstruct the genre assuccessfully as Madoka Magica. In this regard, Urobuchi Gen lives true to his name, as he manages to carefully and logically dissect the magical girl genre, turning it into an often cruel and unforgiving place. The tension and horror that Gen creates is further compounded by an aura of ambiguity that lies over the setting, which is propagated by one of the most unreliable exposition characters of all time, Kyube. In such a universe there is no solace to be found in this little mascot companion, all the while there are barrages of unsettling revelations. \\n\\n\r\nIn appreciating the incredible atmosphere of this anime, one must not certainly forget composer Yuiji Kajura. The way she manages to bring out the often somber and dark atmosphere of the show with nothing but the ambience of her music is breath taking. In particular, the way each episode in the series is led into the powerfully dark ending theme, Magia, is chilling. It would not be an overstatement to say that without her contribution, Madoka Magica may have only been two-thirds as great. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough perhaps a bit eclipsed by Urobuchi Gen, Shinbo\u2019s style and hand in the series is definitely there. From the trippy and LSD induced scenes of the witches that create a sense of a foreign environment, to how usual scenes are made to look surreal, it is definitely classic Shinbo. Whether or not one will appreciate his distinctive style in a magical girl show is a different story. Sometimes seeing a bunch of mustache men and your lunch integrated into the action sequences just goes a little bit too far. There were often points in the series that perhaps would have done better with a more traditional approach to animation and art. This is not to say that Shinbo did not have his usual touches of brilliance, but that there is a fine line between brilliance and just being flat out pretentious, which at times I felt, was violated.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite everything, the story can be boiled down to the personal struggle of our main character Kaname Madoka. As an idealistic young girl, she has to come to terms with the cynical universe she is placed in and search for the best answer to solving the vaguely dark and evil forces that threaten to destroy the world she has come to love. The decisions she has to make eventually culminate into a very touching and emotional conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while the plot often forces the characters into dire situations, it is through these plot points that the viewer is truly able to see what each character is made of. In doing so Gen manages to not sacrifice the emotional involvement in this show in his pursuit of deconstruction, maintaining a nice balance of both intellectual and emotional satisfaction. Madoka Magica manages to become a unique experience that almost any anime fan can appreciate, and for that, it is fully deserving of the accolades it receives.\\n",

            "content": "Before this show was aired, anime enthusiasts were looking forward to cute character designs, pretty visuals, and charming stories of friendship. Weeks later, the same people were indeed enjoying those \u2014 while decoding encrypted text, citing 19th century German literature, brushing up on physics, and debating about ethics. \r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka\u2606Magica has certainly been the center of much attention. Despite the efforts of the creators to tone down certain elements in their promotional videos, the anime has suffered from levels of hype and backlash unseen since Neon Genesis Evangelion and the Haruhi series. The presence of notable names in the list of collaborators suggests thatthe show could be mind-blowing at best, or worth seeing at the very least. Regardless of these (or perhaps, because of these), there are two things to keep in mind when watching the show: Don't judge a book by its cover, and read between the lines.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with our protagonist Madoka and her friends living ordinary carefree lives until Kyubey, the obligatory cute mascot, appears. He calls upon them to become magical girls and fight the menace of the witches; in exchange, Kyuubey offers the girls the chance to have any single wish granted. Thus the life of a magical girl begins with a decision, and this leads to consequences both intended and unforeseen. Once the perils of the vocation are revealed, it becomes apparent that, as with any position of power, there's much more to magical girls than being selfless, righteous, and idealistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise seems fairly standard enough, it doesn't stay that way for long. Not in the hands of writer Urobuchi Gen. This anime takes the magical girl genre and infuses it with elements more reminiscent of Silent Hill 2 rather than Sailor Moon. The result is an unorthodox mix which induces cognitive dissonance. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Madoka\u2606Magica goes a step beyond simply contrasting ideas. More than just combining disparate details for the purpose of shocking the audience, Urobuchi Gen weaves these elements together to create a bigger picture. The plot itself is excellent, though not as revolutionary as hardcore fans would claim it to be. Even so, few anime titles out there could match this series in terms of thematic development, and it's a pity that only a handful express appreciation for this particular highlight. Some viewers may nitpick about factors such as technical details and suspension of disbelief, but given that the story prioritizes purpose over plausibility, I find most of the criticisms of these aspects to be blown out of proportion. \\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say that the story is without shortcomings. Having the series limited to a mere 12 episodes is simultaneously a boon and a bane. On one hand, it forces the creators to use a compact and focused style of storytelling which leaves no room for insignificant details. This accentuates the suspense of the plot and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. On the other hand, developments feel rushed on more than one occasion. Despite the good use of foreboding for most of the show, some twists still come suddenly with no warning whatsoever. Character development may have also suffered as the limited time made it difficult to flesh out the cast completely.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the previous points, opinions seem to be less divided with regards to aesthetics. This comes as no surprise since the merits of the audio and visuals are much more evident.\\n\\n\r\nThose familiar with Kajiura Yuki's previous works may set their expectations high as the music of this series does not disappoint. Similar to the soundtrack of Kara no Kyoukai, the pieces in Madoka\u2606Magica range from light and pleasant to haunting and dramatic. The ending theme in particular (Magia) is song that packs a lot of impact by featuring a mesmerizing tune and lyrics which are actually relevant to the story. \\n\\n\r\nOn the side of animation, director Shinbou Akiyuki brings in SHAFT's distinct art style puts it to good use. Although attentive viewers could easily spot signs of budget/time constraints at several instances, I find these shortcomings forgivable given how well the visuals were utilized for most of the show. Besides presenting eye-candy, the images play a significant role in presenting ideas. Appreciating the numerous details may require a bit of effort on the part of the viewers, but it does make the experience much more interactive and rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Aoki Ume's designs lie a bit on the cartoonish side. They're easy on the eyes and they have the unexpected benefit of having virtually no fanservice potential (except perhaps for the well-endowed Mami). However, these designs offer little advantage for later dramatic scenes after the dissonance has worn off. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately the voice acting makes up for this, and Madoka\u2606Magica has some of the most moving performances I've heard in years. Special mention goes to Yuuki Aoi for giving life to the main character in her moments of distress.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up: This anime is by no means perfect, but I find its flaws heavily outweighed by its more outstanding aspects. Hype or no hype, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2606Magica is a show worth paying attention to \u2014 if you're willing to pay attention.",

            "content": "*This is an in-depth review with spoilers.\r\nA rare original (non-adaptation) anime series by SHAFT, 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2606Magica' began like any other Mahou Shoujo series, and while it's not ground-breakingly original in any way, it's anything but ordinary.\r\nStory / Character:\r\nThe story is a very well thought-out three-act structure. Beginning with a standard exposition(ep1-2) of an action teaser to draw viewer's attention, and introduction of all the main characters before the protagonist learns the existence and power of Mahou Shoujo, and their unseen threat in ordinary life. Followed by conflict and rising action(ep3-9), where people around Madoka become involved in the underground war between Mahou Shoujo andwitches. Finally, the climax(ep10-11) and resolution(ep12) as Akemi's identity is revealed and Madoka finally gets her abilities, before the aftermath in the final episode. Although the story starts out very slowly, it slowly draws you in. The perfect example of this is the very first sequence with Akemi losing badly against Walpurgis Night before Madoka asks to sacrifice her soul to save her friend. I for one knew this sequence was a classic \u300c\u5922\u30aa\u30c1\u300d(\"dream punch line\"), because my first impression was: \"There's no way SHAFT would make something so corny\". However, the IDENTICAL sequence was shown in the climax ep10, and this time it was overwhelmingly dramatic and touching. This must be the exact reaction the producers were looking for, a solid proof of the engrossing nature of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to say whether this series is predictable or not. Like the opening sequence, there are many clich\u00e9s. On the other hand, there are some elements of this show that comes as a total surprise or distinctly different from your average Mahou Shoujo. For one, characters died in rapid succession, and none of the characters really came back to life (not in the primary timeline). Personally, I thought Mami was perhaps the mastermind behind it, and faked her death somehow to get others to sign the contract. Also, we're all accustomed to the miraculous rescues and close calls that save protagonist's allies from death. This does not happen here. It really turns out to be a desperate war to the last man (or should I say, girl) standing. The transformation sequence also occurs only once per person. Yes, no scene recycling, and no attempted ecchi either. Then of course, there's the time loop.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"conflict\" section of the show was an extremely difficult watch. The problem was not the pacing, but the fact that it crosses the suspension of disbelief despite its serious tone. It really forces the audience to accept excessive plot holes and irrational character behaviors. However, the time loop had completely turned the tables.\\n\\n\r\nEp10, titled 'I Will Never Depend on Anyone Again', was so much of a \u300c\u795e\u56de\u300d (\"epic episode\") that I feel the episode needs an entire paragraph of its own. Being a time-loop episode, it does make many references to the past episodes. Like when Akemi and Madoka meet for the very first time in ep10, Madoka turns around in hallway to say \"Homura\" is a wonderful name. If you remember, there was a similar event in the first episode, which even had the same turning shoe-shot then two-shot scene from the side. That shoe-shot was deliberately planted in the first episode to assist the emphasis of alternate reality in ep10. The same conversation came up in the \"main timeline\" (ep1), and Akemi and Madoka's positions have physically and psychologically reversed, with Akemi being the confident one, and even her reaction to the compliment is opposite.\\n\r\nEverything else about the \"first timeline\" was polar opposite of the \"main timeline\" we have been following up to ep10. From there on, she repeats the same events over and over to try to change destiny, much like 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Kai'. What makes this episode exceptional is the non-stop emotionally draining sequences of drama and action, with every single scene carefully chosen to depict Akemi's changing personality, without repeating too many same events even though she goes through 4 time loops in a single episode. It still amaze me how they were able to pack so much material in 25 minutes. Akemi fails every single time, but her personality gradually changes from an insecure and frail girl to cool-headed and powerful fighter. At the same time, the despair, anger, mistrust, and finally a sense of futility growing within her. Yet, the bond between Akemi and Madoka have only strengthened, single-sidedly.\\n\r\nThe episode completely throws you off in the beginning, but explains most of the major mysteries in the past episodes:\\n\r\n* Akemi's ability to instantly kill enemies\\n\r\n* How she knew Madoka's name, and that Walpurgis Night was coming\\n\r\n* Why she doesn't team up with others\\n\r\n* Why she didn't just kill Kyuubey after Mami died, to prevent its contact with Madoka and Sayaka\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are still many unexplained irrational character behavior that made it hard to appreciate the first half:\\n\r\n* Why didn't Madoka just wish for all witches to disappear in the beginning? - She wanted people to stop fighting, that would've been an obvious wish that could've proven Kyuubey's \"I can grant you any wish\" to be false (or so he would think).\\n\r\n* Why did Mami act like an evil mastermind in the beginning? - Deliberate misleading or not, the way she acted was strange unless she was the villain who was behind all (which she was not).\\n\r\n* Why didn't Akemi tell Madoka to her face what she's getting herself into? - If they didn't believe in time travel, telling everyone of the truth about Mahou Shoujo would have done the trick. She can even prove it by taking someone's crystal out of range.\\n\r\n* Why suspect other Mahou Shoujo? - If Akemi and Kyouko were indeed selfish, wouldn't they just ignore witches instead of fighting just to get magic replenishment? Sayaka's sudden distrust makes no sense.\\n\r\n* What is the problem with leaving the territory for those who are interested in Grief Seeds? - At the time, they were not aware of Familiars or that they can turn into witches. Why were they so eager to stop Mahou Shoujo who were solely interested in Grief Seeds?\\n\r\n* Why didn't Sayaka wish Kyousuke's injury to be completely cured? - It's just strange to cure only his hands instead of entire body.\\n\r\n* If Kyuubey's race has no emotion, why does it speak with emotion? - ???\\n\\n\r\nWish granting and time loops are tricky business, but ultimately, the scriptwriting was sloppy, and character development of side characters were rushed through (especially that of Sayaka, whose sudden change in personality was not convincing, nor that of Kyouko's). It was interesting though, that the story was driven by the side characters, and the \"protagonist\" Madoka was just trying to make sense of everything happening around her.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending (resolution) was a typical \"protagonist surpasses the law of the universe\". We've all seen it before, even in the same season with 'Yumekui Merry'. While this was very well executed with an afterthought of Madoka, it was overly predictable and corny. This might sound stupid, but I was actually hoping for an open ending for this series. Maybe she fights Walpurgis Night alone, fails, and goes back to the beginning again, only with more hope from maybe a word of encouragement from Madoka. Still, the actual ending was rather conclusive, and a fitting ending for the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBackground art is incredible. The outdoor scenes are visually reminiscent of 'ef' series in that the skies look like they have gone through a hundred gradient and gloss filters and everything is pretty and shiny. Visually pleasing, but nothing out of the ordinary. The \"Alternate Space Design\" or the \"boundary world\" of witches by animation team 'Gekidan Inu Curry', on the other hand, were absolutely phenomenal. The collage effect is somewhat similar to that of 'Mononoke', but far more detailed with better textures. The heroines enter the alternate space almost every single episode, and the scenery of the \"boundary world\" is different depending on the witch's despair. Scene transitions are often seamless with various special effects, the best one was perhaps ep10 witch that attacked Akemi, which began from pain and suffering as depicted in Picasso's 'Guernica' to the bloody eternal darkness version of Van Gogh's 'The Starry Night'. There's something about the surreality of the collages that instills fear into the audience.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters were drawn in 'Hidamari Sketch' style that did not match the theme nor the backgrounds. I suspect this style was chosen for the additional shock value of cute and innocent looking girls causing and falling victim to violent destruction, but it was totally not worth the incongruity it caused in most scenes.\\n\r\nThe art direction (camera angle, the way scenes are presented) were entertaining in the usual SHAFT fashion that contributes to seemingly accelerated pace.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOP 'Connect' by ClariS is exceedingly bland for a theme song. Was 'Irony' in 'OreImo' a fluke? The ED 'Magia', however, is a wonderful dark despair song that also works very well as battle insert song.\\n\r\nBGM is almost equally wonderful, with most pieces seem to be dominated by string and percussion instruments, successfully conveying the mysterious and scary atmosphere of \"boundary worlds.\" Sound for special effects also sounded very real, and dynamic enough as buildup for the battle scenes.\\n\r\nVoice Acting for Madoka was overly strained, and her mother sounded way too cool for the appearance, but otherwise wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nThere were some serious convenient story writing in the first half, but the masterpiece that is ep10 'I Will Never Depend on Anyone Again' and the following climax episode 'The Last Remaining Path' has saved the series from disaster, though not enough to completely remove the bitter aftertaste of earlier episodes. My favorite moment in this series is when Madoka says \"I will never forget you saved me\" in ep4. In afterthought (after watching ep10), it must have been excruciating for Akemi that her effort to save Madoka has been forgotten many times already, and the pain of listening to her say that she will never forget. Her bitter reaction finally makes sense. 'Madoka Magica' may have been more sloppy than their usual adaptations, but it's subtle scenes like this, and the previously mentioned hallway scene, that makes SHAFT one of the best anime studios around, because of the way they deliver the truly important scenes in ways that you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nI am certain the second viewing of this series will be far more enjoyable, as more of those subtle scenes start to make sense.",

            "content": "Madoka is hands-down the best anime series of 2011 thus far, and a contender for the best anime series of all-time. How could an original, non-adaptation magical girl show of all shows end up rousing the anime community in such a fashion?\r\nWhat starts out as a regular, pastel-colored magical girl show quickly turns on its head as the magical girls come to realize that they're in a zero-sum situation: the stakes are real, and for every bit of hope given in the world, an equal amount of despair must be displaced. The first three episodes have a sense of normalcy to them, but it isthis calm before the storm that sets the stage for the chaos which resides through the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs each revelation is presented, the viewer is left with some thought-provoking questions. Is the antagonist truly evil, or just looking out for the needs of the many? Is Madoka, the lead character, selfish in delaying her decision to be a magical girl? And what about the true intentions of the other magical girls? The answers to those and more are carefully presented at the right times, never too fast or too slow. However, the more the viewer learns, the more the viewer realizes that there's still much to be realized. Nothing is ever certain, and the viewer is kept on edge the entire way. It is not until the final two episodes that all the pieces connect in a harmonious manner.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation of the series is spot-on. The imagery of each of the witches' labyrinths is unique and firmly brings each combat scene into one of terror rather than one of indifference or skepticism. The rough, imperfect drawings of the characters' expressions only serve to remind the viewer that none of them are the ideal, righteous heroes that they thought they would be. As for the orchestral soundtrack, it blends in so well that you almost don't notice it's even there. Only the ending theme played at certain combat scenes steals the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nThe hype leading up to these final two episodes (that were aired together) was unprecedented, the likes of which had never been seen before. Full-page ads for just the final airing were printed in major Japanese newspapers. Multiple volumes of the blu-ray release were sitting at the top of Amazon JP's preorder list. Some shrewd people were even streaming live feeds of the final episodes over the internet. Everyone and their dog had an opinion on the show in the blogosphere, and a wiki site was created for the series. There were passionate discussions of a wide variety, such as the basis of entropy, the emotional breakdowns of the characters, the parallels with previous historical works such as Faust, and of course, the merits of specific scenes in the ending. Madoka took the pure, proud obsession of anime fans and gathered them together for one main event.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Madoka truly the greatest anime series of all-time? There can never be a concrete answer to that given the unique tastes of each individual. Indeed, there will always be people who will claim any sort of personal issue or technicality to prevent giving this a 10. However, it does what almost no show does: transcend its genre while maintaining homage to what it surpassed, requiring little prior knowledge of the anime medium as a whole. If there was to be any half-season series that you could show a friend who wasn't into anime at all, this would be the one. All that hype was definitely real. Thankfully, you can now marathon the whole series in one sitting instead of becoming crazy while waiting for the next episode, as many people were.",

            "content": "This is the slightly shorter version, if you are interested, you can read the unabridged one as blog entry on my profile.\r\nStory:\r\nUsually the story of a magical girl anime is about the main character becoming\u2026well, a magical girl, learning and growing and turning a whiny, timid girl into a confident, strong woman. Of course exceptions may exist (I am not an expert on this genre, even though I\u2019ve watched some of the more prominent shows). Madoka takes a different road to get to the same destination. Madoka Magica is the story about a girl growing stronger and becoming a more confident person by NOT becominga magical girl. Instead we witness her witnessing the paths of other magical girls and learning from their mistakes. People have accused her of being a nuisance to the story, but these folks seem to be missing the whole point of the show. Being a magical girl is not glamorous or fulfilling and least of all rewarding. The anime tries for a somewhat realistic approach of the subject. What would real girls do if they were given the opportunity, if they were fighting these abominationsI personally think that Madoka just seems grim to many people because it does not leave out the negative aspects of being a magical girl. Sure, other shows had that too, but having both, the realistic side of it and the negatives, might make it an uncomfortable watch. But one should not overlook the fact that the overall message it is trying to get across is a very positive one (even if it may not sound like it). Think before you act.\\n\\n\r\nBut without a thrilling story this would all go to waste, so let\u2019s take a look at that. The characters have different opinions and philosophies, which often do not work out well with those of others. What begins as a fight between magical girls and witches evolves into a much, much bigger picture until we are left with nobody being truly right or wrong and the outcome being completely uncertain. Even the ending does not make itself clear. The road throughout these 12 episodes is filled with twists and turns and if you manage to watch Madoka completely unspoilered, you will be in for a couple of big surprises (unless you are really good at guessing). But Madoka becomes even BETTER when you rewatch it with full knowledge. Which brings me to another thing that this show does incredibly well. There are tons of little details that are easy to miss the first time around, heavy, heavy foreshadowing of later events in the earlier episodes. There is so much going on that one can only fully digest it in a rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing before we move on. Often, I have whined about 12 episode anime being too short for their own good. That is not the case here. Sure, Madoka has the advantage of being an original creation, so it doesn\u2019t need to convey itself from one medium to the other, but it is still remarkable that this anime has no filler whatsoever. Every scene, every small remark has a purpose. This allows for the rather complex story to be perfectly played out in just about four hours. In total, the writing and direction is absolutely stunning. The people at work here knew exactly what they were doing. I would never go so far as to call something perfect, but this is probably as close as it gets.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCharacter movement is very smooth and looks natural, something I highly appreciate after watching one too many anime where this was not the case. It\u2019s always a matter of how much it fits the work, so for comedies for example, unnaturally animated characters can be perfectly fine. In a serious show like this however, it\u2019s crucial to make the people look like, well, people. The special effects work just the way they should, there is no badly used CGI that has sadly become the standard (and the recap movies are guilty of this as well).\\n\\n\r\nThe responsible person for character design is Ume Aoki, best known for the cutesy girls in Hidamari Sketch. While the girls in Madoka are not as cuddly as them, they are still designed to be cute. This was one of the major factors that were used to mislead the audience into thinking this would be a light-hearted show and to this day makes it very hard to convince people that Madoka is not a simple moe anime. One might argue that this design choice is irritating and distracts from the overall experience of the drama, but I disagree. The backgrounds are often overlooked when talking about Madokas artwork, but I think they play an integral part. The world of Madoka Magica looks highly technically advanced, which also makes it feel very cold. A very good example is the school, which is full of high tech and glass walls. It gives me a vibe of claustrophobia. On the other hand, the landscapes, which are often very effectively shown in wide angle shots, do the exact opposite. It should also be noted, that there are multiple real world buildings to be seen, which is a cool little bonus for those who recognize them.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably a good opportunity to address a certain aspect of Shaft anime, the hardly finished TV version vs. the revised DVD/Blu-ray version. While this would usually be a huge problem and embarrassment, Shaft somehow manages to work with it, most prominently in the Monogatari series. In Madoka, the two versions can create two very different scenarios and even character aspects. For example, on TV, Mamis room was completely empty, sticking out like a sore thumb. The revision completely changes this to a room filled with tons of girlish accessories, which can ALSO be seen as a sign of her loneliness, only this time she tries hard to cover it underneath all the kitsch.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura does an incredible job here. Pieces like \u201cSurgam Identidem\u201d, \u201cNux Walpurgis\u201d or \u201cSymposium Magarum\u201d make their scenes and leave an immense emotional impact. \u201cAnima Mala\u201d and \u201cVenari Strigas\u201d emphasize the darkness and tension respectively in the scenes they are in and the ever haunting \u201cSis Puella Magica\u201d constantly emits a mysterious aura, like something is not quite right. I could talk for hours about almost any piece of the soundtrack. The opening song is one of the weakest of the soundtrack, but that is very subjective, since I don\u2019t like J-Pop very much. It\u2019s still a lot nicer to listen to than many other random anime openings, and it has a secondary function as well. As part of the false advertisement as a kid-friendly happy-go-lucky magical girl show, the opening song is exactly what the viewer would be expecting of such a thing. Same goes for the first ending song, that you may not even know, but it is used after the first two episodes on the blu-ray. After the mask went off, the ending was changed to the fantastic \u201cMagia\u201d by Kalafina. There\u2019s one more ending for the blu-ray version of episode nine. It\u2019s a cute duet done by Eri Kitamura and Ai Nonaka, the voice actors of Sayaka and Kyouko. Speaking of which\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very, very good. Actually not that surprising if you take a look at the cast of the show. Let\u2019s start with the two I already mentioned. Kitamura is great at doing extreme emotions, that\u2019s why she usually voices hot-blooded characters. With Sayaka, she can run riot in that department and she did. Kitamura is a perfect fit. Nonaka does more or less the opposite. Most of her more prominent roles fall into the category of moe, something Kyouko does not stand for (even though she is, but you know what I mean). She doesn\u2019t even sound much different than usual, but she makes it work nonetheless. The fact that she is portrayed as a heartless monster (at first) but still sounds like a little girl makes her cruelness all the more jarring. Aoi Yuuki is an expert in voicing cute, innocent girls, so Madoka befits her nicely. But despite being very convincing as a whiney, weak girl, she is more than able to step up her game later on, when we see Madoka a lot more confident.\\n\\n\r\nChiwa Saito reprises her role as Senjougahara by playing another seemingly emotionless mystery girl. Later on, when we get to see more sides of Homura, she recalls her whole repertoire in an overwhelming fashion. It\u2019s hard to believe that these two are the same person and that is exactly what we are supposed to feel. Emiri Katou does a convincing little alluring bunnycat, but not too cute, after all, Kyuubey is an authority figure (kind of). Kaori Mizuhashi does a wonderful job as big sister role model Mami Tomoe and at this point I have to stop myself, because I start to sound like an advertisement for these people\u2019s agency. To make it short (too late boy), the voices are all done very well and with attention to detail, showcasing a lovely amount of passion for the project.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe cast of Madoka is relatively small, with only about a dozen named characters and only have of them recurring. However, these characters are interesting and fleshed out enough, that they are all you need to tell a compelling story, especially if you take the constant character development into account. All five girls have a solid backstory that explains their actions and thoughts and make them believable, while we are left mostly in the dark about Kyuubeys motivations and goals until the end. How multi-dimensional the characters are is especially blatant in the many, many dialogues Madoka has. Very often the girls can be seen in pairs of two, showing how much they differ from each other but also what they have in common. Due to their very different personalities, each of these pairs has vastly different dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka, the girl this show is named after seems to be the main character. Makes sense, right? But as the story progresses, this fact comes into question, as several plot points hint at somebody else being the real main character. She is however the center everything revolves around, but I can somewhat understand how one can overlook this as she is often damned to a passive role. She is anything but however, as long as she is given the chance. You see, even though she is a timid girl with low self-esteem, she is not a coward that just swells in her helplessness. That\u2019s the point of her character, she does not like how things are going and she tries to find a way to change this. Homura is the other character one can say is the focus of this anime, though we don\u2019t get to know much about her until late in the series. Her objectives and abilities remain mysterious for a long time, all we know is that she has knowledge that the others don\u2019t. The fact that it is never fully clear which side she is on makes for a lot of tension for everyone and much like Madoka, she is trying to change things, but she is able to work towards this more actively. Once we get to take a look at who she really is, she becomes a much more sympathetic character, even though her goal is a very selfish one.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Madoka and Homura are the protagonists of Madoka Magica, the driving force of the story is somebody else: Sayaka. The constant descend into drama has a lot to do with her and how she is slowly but surely mentally broken. She starts out as the more confident and pro-active companion to Madoka and unlike her, she is very decisive and has a clear morality and opinion on things. She is very into the idea of becoming a magical girl and the fact that this utterly destroys her leaves a lasting impact on Madoka and changes her perspective accordingly. What I especially liked about Sayaka was how well handled her love story is. Usually, these feel like they are shoehorned in, but here, the whole thing is believable and makes sense in context. It also works in terms of showing us a different side of the otherwise brash and tomboyish Sayaka.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there are Kyouko and Mami. Due to the rather short runtime of the anime, these two get the short end of the stick, which is a pity, but not necessarily a bad thing. They both serve a purpose to the story and in my opinion, the fact that there is much left to explore with them makes them the most interesting of the magical girls. There is a lot that is told between the lines, especially when it comes to Mami. We get to see her as this proper and a bit cocky big sister type that acts as the mentor of Madoka and Sayaka and only at the very end we get a glimpse of what lies underneath: loneliness. She is not only lonely, she becomes possessive the very moment the possibility of a friendship presents itself. Everything Kyouko says and does early on leaves the impression that she is a villain, but this is not a world of black and white. She is more or less right, there is no turning back and now it\u2019s all about survival. That\u2019s awful, but that\u2019s how it is and there is nothing you can do about it. Only when she has a change of heart does her world crumble as well.\\n\\n\r\nKyuubey is an interesting villain, as he is not evil in a tradtional sense. He lacks emotions (that\u2019s what he claims at least) and most of all empathy. The magical girls are merely means for the purpose of his bigger goal and he couldn\u2019t care less how much they suffer or if they survive or die horribly. In fact, their suffering plays into his cards so he is pushing them towards the edge in a passive-aggressive manner quite often. How much of what he says is the truth has been the subject of heated debates for years and I think that is what makes him so intriguing. All we know is that he is the root of the problem for everybody else. I\u2019m going to refrain from talking that much about the rest of the cast, they are of less importance (though they aren\u2019t exactly unimportant, mind you) than the six main characters and are therefore fleshed out a lot less, but they still fulfill their roles exactly like they are supposed to to keep the story moving.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is a well-written, well-animated anime with an interesting cast, a fantastic soundtrack and most of all, a plot that makes sense from start to finish. I\u2019m sure many of you will be able to find something to pick on, but for me, this show is as good as it gets and I have yet to see something better. Everything works, there are no weak spots. I highly recommend Madoka for anyone, no matter what kind of anime you usually prefer. Sure, my opinion might be clouded by Madoka being my favourite anime, but aren\u2019t all reviews subjective anyway? I think this anime justifies all the hype, even if internet hipsters like to bash it. I couldn\u2019t find a flaw that would have made me not give a perfect score (my very first in 100 reviews).\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10.0/10",

Evangelion defines the 1990's, capturing the mood of Japan at the time. Haruhi Suzumiya led to an explosion in moe culture, defining the 2000's. Madoka Magica would surely define the 2010's, at least up until now.\r\nFor example, would Made in Abyss be the success it was, or would it even get animated, if its formula of cute-meets-soul-crushing wasn't done here first? Unlikely.\r\nIts character development is probably the best thing on show. Each of our main cast has a certain amount of relatability about them.Even our \"villain\", when the details of his plotting are revealed, make you see his point, after some thought\\n\\n\r\nThis is yet another production by studio shaft, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou, which should give you some idea of how it looks. The characters' designs are well-done, but the witches are artbook-worthy, being imaginatively designed.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the Monogatari series, the soundtrack is nicely done, the opening theme lulling viewers into a false sense of security from the very start.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 10 rating because anything less would be an insult for a work of this magnitude. 'Masterpiece' is an entirely appropriate word to use when describing it.",

            "content": "The fact that so many people still name Puella Magi Madoka Magica \u201cthe greatest or most significant or most influential\" mahou shoujo series of all time only tells you how anime still is from becoming a serious art. Classic critics have long recognized that the greatest mahou shoujou series of all times are Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon and Revolutionary Girl Utena, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Other critics rank the highly controversial Princess Tutu over classic anime who were highly popular in courts around Japan. This new wave of anime fansare still blinded by commercial success: Puella Magi Madoka Magica sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. True anime critics grow up watching a lot of mahou shoujo of the past. Madoka Magica fans are often totally ignorant of the mahou shoujo of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that Puella Magi Madoka Magi did anything worth of being saved.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense Puella Magi Madoka Magica is emblematic of the status of modern anime criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena and too little attention to the merits of real anime. If somebody composes the most divine mahou shoujo seires but Crunchyroll refuses to hype it up and stream it around the world, a lot of bloggers will ignore it. If every teenager on MAL hypes up a mahou shoujo series which is as stereotyped as one can be but launches it worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on said series. This is the sad status of modern anime criticism.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica sells not because it's the greatest mahou shoujo series of all time but simply because it is easy to sell to the masses: it has no difficult content, it has no technical innovations, it has no creative depth. Gen Urobuchi just wrote flat characters and obnoxious plot twists to catch attention of the masses. If somebody had not invented \"Madoka Mania\" in 2011, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial anime.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica- an extremely popular, well loved, and held up by many as a landmark in the magical girl genre. A show that many describe as having beautiful artwork, a fantastic soundtrack, and contains one of the most exciting and unexpected stories in anime of late. Is Madoka Magica all of these things? Yes, and no. Let\u2019s find out what it is that works and doesn\u2019t. Note that I will try my best to avoid spoilers- but for my analysis of the plot, there may be one element that could be considered a minor spoiler. \r\nBeginning with the Artwork and Animation: \r\nMadoka definitely lives upto its reputation of having unique artwork. The trippy witch labyrinth sequences are, in a word, psychedelic. Imagine, if you will- a mixture of Salvador Dali\u2019s Dadaism mixed with Picasso, all in a very surreal, vibrantly colorful atmosphere. As for the character artwork and backdrops, Madoka is fairly average- with quite a few moments of very low detail in the characters, and a number of still frames used to conserve the budget. For the use of the surrealist art alone, this anime earns a place among the visually striking, but is dragged down at times by the standard animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe show succeeds to a much greater degree on the Sound and Voice Acting front, however. I watched it in both languages, and both are equally watchable. There are no real virtuoso performances in this, but it\u2019s handled very competently. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is very good. Opening and ending songs aside, the background music is really something- with everything from dark, grinding industrial music to classical violin to medieval chant to soft piano instrumentals to introspective and dramatic orchestral pieces, and even a few rock pieces, too. I\u2019m no Yuki Kajiura fan by any means, but this is decidedly one of her best works. The soundtrack is very effective in tense and dramatic moments, as well as it is in emotive and introspective ones. If nothing else good can be said about Madoka Magica- the music is really something. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what is this, \u201cSurvivor\u2019s Guilt: The Anime\u201d? \\n\\n\r\nThe idea behind the show is that these girls who are given magical powers are granted one single wish in exchange for their soul and servitude, in order to eradicate these entities of curses and malice known as witches. If offered a single wish in exchange for one\u2019s soul, does it not occur to the person that they should perhaps ask for more? The wishes are often very poorly thought out, especially in foresight and scope. There was no stipulation that \u201cmore wishes\u201d was against the rules. This isn\u2019t Aladdin\u2019s genie, who laid the rules down up front before any wish could be asked. \\n\\n\r\nThe wishes are also extremely shallow and selfish, especially considering that they\u2019re offered \u201cliterally anything\u201d by the wish granter, with the guarantee that it would come true. Their wishes are the equivalent of wishing for a car, when they could just be given an entire factory that can produce any car, or other vehicle for that matter, and an unlimited number of resources with which to supply it. The wishes are similarly short sighted and fruitless overall. It\u2019s not necessarily true to say that the characters are stupid- because they really aren\u2019t. Madoka describes herself as being very average and \u201cnot particularly smart, beautiful, or talented\u201d, and she\u2019s exactly this: average. This show examines a group of otherwise absolutely average individuals given otherworldly powers. They don\u2019t conform to normative anime color coded hair and character archetype tropes- which was refreshing, but at the same time, being that the characters were more grounded, they were also pretty predictable in their decisions. This, I think was used to good effect in a sort of \u201cdon\u2019t do it!\u201d, and \u201cthis can\u2019t end well\u201d type of way for the viewer, but inevitably you know that they\u2019re going to do it anyway. Perhaps this adds a more tragic element to it for the viewer, but for me it was mostly frustrating to watch characters make stupid decisions that were obviously not given much thought to.\\n\\n\r\nOften in anime or film, we have characters who are defined by one trait- such as Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass being the embodiment of a lawful good rule follower. He exists for no other purpose than to uphold the rules. Or, we have a one note harem girl who is an animate <insert prefix>-dere archetype. Similarly, the characters in Madoka Magica who have the most screentime have the least depth and are least thought out. I think it\u2019s because these other, lesser characters weren\u2019t given as much exposition, but were given very cut and dried motivations for making their choices (and wishes). It\u2019s not enough to say that their \u201cwish\u201d becomes the essence of their being, but even before they act out on said wish, their character is held back by this shallow, small scale goal. Perhaps they were designed to be that way- average, small minded people who don\u2019t think ahead, but I see it as an oversight in character development- where they don\u2019t consider that, when given an opportunity, they should concern themselves with all avenues that it may lead to. This was the focal point of the first four episodes or so- and I applaud the show for having the characters take time and reflect on their decisions (or lack thereof), but ultimately this is pointless, because they\u2019re either conned into or make the same decision they were struggling make to begin with, even when faced with the gravity of making said decision. \\n\\n\r\nFurthering this point, Homura\u2019s motivations are poor, to say the least. Dio Brando wanted to enslave the world because his dad was a jerk to him as a child. That\u2019s a bad motive. Many shows revolve around a concept of friendship and the ties that bind, but this show takes this to a bit of an unbelievable degree- while still borrowing concepts from a much more tightly run series. If faced with a traumatic event involving a friend, and then given the decision to redo that part of my life, potentially with a different outcome, while my friends and family lose recollection of said event, VS allowing the event to happen or just taking myself out of the equation and observing whether it played out differently, I would choose the latter. If presented the trolley problem, and I had to kill an animal in order to eat it and survive or whatnot, it\u2019s a non-decision to make- but one that\u2019s turned into a needlessly wrestled-with problem in this show- ESPECIALLY when combined with the wishes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also highlights very strongly why time travel is like taking a shotgun to the plot. Not only does it create a series of very questionable events and choices (and holes), but also opens up the story to \u201cwell, if this character can go back in time, why didn\u2019t they just go back to X event that leads to Y consequence?\u201d issues. Again, this topic was handled better in a pair of other, similar shows that were much less loose with their rules of time manipulation and the consequences thereof. I found myself asking \u201cif this character can go back in time, why is it that they don\u2019t just go back and stop the birth of the antagonist that plagues them?\u201d Or \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t this character go back in time and kill X person?\u201d This would create another paradox on top of the one that already exists in a time manipulation series- but, when a series plays loosely with its internal consistency and logic without a particular explanation of the limitations or grounds by which the time travel is made possible- then ergo, anything should be possible, right? This would have wrapped the plot up in a pretty pink bow (pun intended), with just a few words and actions by certain characters, but by virtue of \u201cthat\u2019s not how the show was written\u201d- it wasn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that needs to be addressed, though, is this false claim that Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre. Perhaps my own understanding of what \u201cdeconstruction\u201d in a literary use is, but my understanding is that it takes some established trope, idea, archetype, etc and draws attention to it- specifically how it works in a more \u201crealized\u201d setting vs the \u201cidealized\u201d. For example: In School Days, this is taking the idea of a harem, and then showing how playing a bunch of girls off on each other is probably a bad idea, and that Japanese schoolgirls aren\u2019t all necessarily polyamorous/okay with sharing partners as many ecchi/school/harem shows would have us believe. I do see that as a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d. A literal taking apart of the trope. Things like parodies aren\u2019t deconstructions, but are subversions- which I think many conflate the meanings of. A subversion is something that you \u201cexpect\u201d, but doesn\u2019t happen in the expected manner. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve established a baseline definition of a subversion vs a deconstruction, here\u2019s how it applies to Madoka Magica: Madoka (the character) has a horrible inability to make decisions for herself. Even the title of the show is a bit misleading in this instance, also similarly to Code Geass- and those who\u2019ve seen the show know exactly why. Because you know based on the title alone \u201cMahou Shoujo\u201d or \u201cPuella Magi\u201d, this show is going to be about some girl who uses magic. Duh. The girl with the dream of being a Magical Girl is offered the chance, but fails to make a decision. That would be a deconstruction- rendering the \u201cMagical Girl\u201d element of the show meaningless. However, if she were to find out that being a Magical Girl is not exactly what she expected, or that it\u2019s not something to necessarily strive for, or not even a good thing at all; then these are all subversions to the Magical Girl trope. Where the Magical Girl is typically painted as a little girl wearing a fancy dress and running around with a cutesy, stuffed animal looking mascot fighting some generic Machiavellian evil in a lighthearted manner, the subversion to this paints these all in a different light- which is exactly what Madoka Magica does. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending also left a bit to be desired- but was also fairly satisfying given the nihilistic feel the story had leading up to the conclusion. However, it felt like they were trying to outdo Gurren Lagann and End of Evangelion at the same time, especially in terms of scope and scale. There\u2019s such a thing as \u201ctoo much\u201d, and I think Madoka came very close to going over. I can\u2019t say I hated Madoka- far from it, really. As a show, it hits some of the right notes- and there\u2019s a blessing and breath of fresh air in the complete absence of fanservice, but as a whole, it really just failed to leave a lasting impression.\\n\r\nEinstein once said that \u201cinsanity was doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.\u201d Madoka Magica embodies this definition with a capital I. It was a different ride; certainly not what I\u2019ve come to expect from a magical girl series, but ultimately has some serious holes in the universe and the logic stemming from twists that leave me a bit ambivalent about how much magic there really is in Madoka. \\n",

So then I watched the first episode and got extremely confused.\r\nThen... I felt as if I was blinded by something. I went back to it. And when I hit the next two episodes, it was a mindfuck. This anime will screw up the image of magical girls. You'll think that they're a bright thing, but in reality, it's like as if a witch casted a spell on the innocent magical girls who want to save the world. Hearingthe truth about them made me shocked for almost a few days that my mind couldn't be sane anymore.\\n\\n\r\nStory (Rate: 10)\\n\r\nThe story of it... At first, you wouldn't understand it since your mind is only just at the beginning of a \"wonderland\". But as you go up and up each number of episodes, your mind. Where is it? You can't find it? That's because the second you see or hear truths being revealed, you can't blink. You can't speak. You can't think. Because it's a thriller. You start the anime with a smile, but at the end, you can't help but try about the truth. This anime turns from a candy wonderland with magical girls in tutus to a hell hole.\\n\\n\r\nArt (Rate: 10)\\n\r\nMostly how they use mystical creatures and the abstract art... It's amazing. At first they're in a peaceful town, next thing you know it, they're in a place where you can be slaughtered. Where you can see blood splattering everywhere without a police or a city patrol strolling by. The fighting, the action... You can't help but gander at it and think... \"Where is my mind?!\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development (Rate: 10)\\n\r\nYou see a few girls around high school age with smiles and giggles. But then you see nothing but tears and regrets a few episodes later. You see how the character drastically change. You even see how a character that is the \"antagonist\" use-to-be happy but they had to change for someone else's life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this anime deserves a 10. Definitely. If it mindfucked ages 14-25 year-olds (which is a very VERY deep age limit), then it deserves nothing but a loud and long round of applause. And a shit load of tears.",

            "content": "The thing about deconstruction anime is that everyone in the industry wants to make one, and the only reason is because that everyone wants a slice of Utena and Evangelion. Too bad not many are able to succeed in overtaking both Evangelion and Utena. The closest i can think of is Now, Here, Then & There which deconstructs the \"another world\" genre but it still failed to make an impact to the industry & fandom like what Eva & Utena did.\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica might not be the next Evangelion & Utena, but it certainly creates the same impact to the industry in the sameway that Evangelion & utena did. With great critical reception and high sales in DVDs and Blu-Rays, Madoka Magica exceeded it's expectations as a deconstruction of the Mahou Shoujo genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a middle schooler named Kaname Madoka who is torn between two choices: to either be a Mahou Shoujo in order to prevent an apocalyptic event called Walpurgisnacht or to not be a Mahou Shoujo in order to save herself from the impending despair befalling her. \\n\\n\r\nIn the midst of these two choices are two people who wants her to decide: Kyubey, a cat-thingy who wants her to be a Mahou Shoujo and Akemi Homura, a Mahou Shoujo who doesn't want her to be a Mahou Shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story starts off basically as that, but as it progresses it becomes more of a Faustian retelling than a simple Mahou Shoujo story. As the anime goes on, her friends and family members became torn as she sees her friends die, her colleagues becoming witches and the suffering Madoka endured. We get to see the true nature of Kyubey, and why Homura does not want Madoka to be a Mahou Shoujo. It's gets sadder, and in the end you can feel the sadness going into your heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that sets Madoka Magica apart from other Mahou Shoujo anime is that not only it's a deconstruction, it's also a more Evangelion-esque take on the genre. This is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo who's known for directing not only SHAFT's greatest works, but also anime masterpieces like Nanoha and La Petite Cosette, so you get alot of influences from Nanoha, Cosette and other SHAFT works in this. It's also written by Nitroplus's gen Urobuchi, known for writing mangas like Saya no Ueta and Fate/Zero along with Nitoplus's games like Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. So unlike Utena, Tutu and other Mahou Shoujo deconstructions, Madoka Magica makes itself way more darker ala Narutaru or Bokurano. Urobuchi was a fan of Mohiro Kitoh, and thus you can see some influences from Kitoh's works in this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty good. Now, SHAFT is also known for being experimental so they also include lots of stop-motion and retro-European animation style. But due to this, you can see QUALITY animation which became the product of 4chan memes. Still, it's nice to look at and it doesn't have \"stop text\" like Shinbo's other anime works.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters start off generic like other Mahou Shoujos, but as the story progresses they become much more interesting. Especially Akemi Homura, where later in the series you get the suffering she endures just to prevent Madoka from being a Mahou Shoujo. Her story is just heartbreaking. Madoka's friend Miki Sayaka also has a good side story, seeing her becoming a Mahou Shoujo because of a promise and getting broken after that. it's mean and sad at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the seiyuus in this are really good. Yuuki Aoi does a good job as Kaname Madoka, whereas SHAFT queen Chiwa Saito is amazing as Akemi Homura. Eri Kitamura does a great job as Miki Sayaka and Kaori Mizuhashi is also good as Mami Tomoe, a blonde but more refined version of her character from Hidamari Sketch. Nonaka Ai (Another SHAFT seiyuu) also does a great job as Kyouko Sakura. But one surprising casting is none other than Emiri Katou as Kyubey. Yes, it's Kagami from Lucky Star doing a role that is definitely different from her Lucky Star days. Holy damn i was surprised and disturbed at how good she is as Kyubey. I'm surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. Yuji kajiura's wonderful music creates this magical atmosphere that is present throughout this series. The OP is wonderful, i love listening to the OP. It's beautiful but as the series progressed, you actually feel sadder listening to it. It's one of the saddest OPs i've listened to in a while. But i don't like the ED. It felt more like a rip-off of a System of a Down song. Seriously, Kalafina's singer sounds like a Japanese high school girl trying to sing like Serj Tankian. I'ms erious. I don't get why people actually like the ED. But in the end, it didn't affect my enjoyment of Yuki Kajiura's music as a whole, so therefore with the exception of the ED, the music and sound of this is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOh and if you really want to enjoy watching this, do not judge this series from its first episode. Watch until episode 3, and after that you will get to know this series better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a well made anime that does the same impact as EVa or Utena. Whereas Utena deconstructs the Sailor Moon style of Mahou Shoujo, this series deconstructs the Nanoha side of Mahou Shoujo, and in the end it's great. It gets into your heart and you'll love it in the end.",

            "content": "In regard of Puella Magi Madoka Magicka, there are two kinds of people.\r\nOn the one hand you have these, who love the show, on the other you have the people who despise this show for being\r\ntotally overrated and not as unique, as it claims to be.\r\nI\u00b4m one of the former kind. I have never seen any mahou-shoujo-show comparable to this.\r\nTo be honest i havn\u00b4t seen many mahou-shoujo-shows at all.\r\nWhen i was little i watched Sailor Moon and i tried some other, like Cardcaptor Sakura and right now i\u00b4m watching\r\nMagical Girl Nanoha and some other.\r\nI still think Puella Magicka is much darker, then any of theformer named.\\n\r\nAlso Puella Magi's story has much more twists, actually at least one per episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's get some structure in this review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magicka starts off like any other mahou-shoujo-show.\\n\r\nOne or a small groupe of school girls get drawn into a fight with a magical monster (they are called witches in this show).\\n\r\nShe is/ they are saved by an other magical girl or the mascot of the show.\\n\r\nThe other magical girl/mascot explains the concept and the rules of the show to the school girl(s) and the audience.\\n\r\nThe school girl(s) decide to help the other magical girl/mascot to fight monsters \\n\r\nand collect MacGuffins (named griefseeds in this show).\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes are totally sterotypical for the mahou-shoujo-genr\u00e9, but after these the show shows it'S true\\n\r\ncolours. Very, very dark colours to be precise.\\n\\n\r\nOf course there are dark and sad moments in other mahou-shoujo-shows as well, but the major difference is, in other shows\\n\r\nthe characters are able to recover from these mental blows.\\n\r\nIn Puealla Magi Madoka Magicka this is not the case.\\n\r\nThe girls get pushed over the limit what they are able to endure.\\n\r\nSeveral of the girls just can't take it any more and thier mind snaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe pressure on the characters gets even higher, because in this show the greif seed is actually no MacGuffin,\\n\r\nit serves the purpose to restore the magical energy of the girls which is needed after becoming a magical girl, not\\n\r\nonly to fight on, but to survive.\\n\\n\r\nSo the girls are forced to ensure a steady supply of grief seeds even if this means to snatch an other girls prey.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe maincharacter, Madoka, is the stereotypical innocent ultimate-magical-girl messiah.\\n\r\nShe only cares for others and acts so sweet, your teeth will start to hurt, just by looking at her.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, she's the only stereotype in this show.\\n\r\nThe others characters seem to be stereotypical at first, but when the story moves on it is shown, \\n\r\nthat the other characters have multible layers of personality.\\n\r\nThese deeper layers often happen to be quite nasty character traits.\\n\r\nMany characters in this show are rather selfish and the word friendship often is not enough to\\n\r\ncalm them down.\\n\\n\r\nThe most obvious example is this shows cute mascot character, Kyuubey.\\n\r\nHe's the stereotypical cute and polite and always wants to help the girls.\\n\r\nBut while the show moves on you realise, all these good traits are just a facade, used to get the girls trust him.\\n\r\nHe's actually extremly cold hearted. He understands nearly nothing of human values.\\n\r\nJust enough to use it to manipulate the girls.\\n\r\nFrom a specific point onwards, he's just extremely creepy.\\n\r\nThis impression is even stronger because of his paradoxial appearence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nYou have to differentiate between two art-styles.\\n\r\nThe first is the real-world-style. In this style everything looks quite normal and the backgrounds are\\n\r\npretty much like every other anime now a days. \\n\r\nThe characters look rather plain compared to other anime these days.\\n\r\nThis might be a matter of taste, but i really like this.\\n\r\nIt makes the characters in this show much more recognizable in direct comparsions with other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second style is the witch-world-style.\\n\r\nTo fight the witches in this series the girls have to enter special dimensions, \\n\r\nwhich where made by the witches.\\n\r\nThese worlds look very surreal.\\n\r\nAlso they are wastly different from each other.\\n\r\nEach witch-world features a special and unique design.\\n\r\nThis goes for the witches as well.\\n\r\nTheir appearences vary from giant half-demon/half-robot monsters to little plushies.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing special about the intro-song. \\n\r\nIt's quite interchangable witch every other intro from mahou-schoujo-shows.\\n\\n\r\nBut the outro-song is a totally different case.\\n\r\nIt reminds me of the early songs of nightwish.\\n\r\nIt's hard beats und the dark overall tune goes quite well, with the dark story, which this show tells.\\n\\n\r\nAn other fact, which makes the outro even more memorizable is, it\u00b4s quite rare.\\n\r\nOnly six out of twelve episode actually end with this outro.\\n\r\nThe other six episodes use the two minutes to let the charcters reflect what just happend, or for foreshadowing\\n\r\nof the next big plot twist while the credits are shown over these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music within the episodes is also better than average.\\n\r\nIn the all days live you get very calming music, like flute tunes.\\n\r\nOr no music at all, so it doesn't distract you from the pichtures you see, or the conversation you hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle music has quite the variety.\\n\r\nDepending in the level of danger the music differs from J-Pop over orchestral to symphonic metal.\\n\\n\r\nconclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThis will be tough...\\n\r\nEither the Puella Magi fans or haters will stone me to death...\\n\r\nBut please keep in mind, that this last part are my personal thoughts, so you don\u00b4t have to agree with me.\\n\r\nIt's just a matter of taste.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what do i think about Puella Magi?\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs Puella Magi really this unique?\\n\\n\r\nI still think, it's just as unique as it claims to be.\\n\r\nYes, there are other magical girl shows, which are rather dark,\\n\r\nbut non the the shows I have seen takes it as far as Puella Magi Madoka Magicka.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs this show a real masterpiece?\\n\\n\r\nAnim\u00e9 is a form of art and art is always a matter of personal taste.\\n\r\nIt's impossible to create something, that is the ultimate form of art and everybody loves it.\\n\r\nWith that said, Puella Magi Madoka Magicka claimed the title of being my favourite anim\u00e9.\\n\r\nSo, from my point of view, i whouldn\u00b4t mind if somebody calls it a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the magical girl genr\u00e9 is as far as you can get away from my favourite genr\u00e9, mecha.\\n\r\n(At least if you ignore Magic Knight Rayearth, which actually is a magical girl meacha show...)\\n\r\nAnd still, Puella Magi managed not only to catch my attention, but to hold it.\\n\r\nI've rewatched my personal favourite episodes, as well as the whole series several time and it\\n\r\nstill manages to entertain me.\\n\r\nSo, there just has to be something special about this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWill you like this show, too?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, i cannot look into your head, so i won't guarantee anything,\\n\r\nbut if you like either dark plots, non-stereotypical characters or the magical girl shows,\\n\r\nthen there's a good chance you will like this show, too.\\n\\n\r\nBut keep in mind, if you try this show, watch at least the first four episodes before you make up your mind.\\n\r\nIf you stop watching earlier you won't notice the real concept behind this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 10/10.\\n\r\nYes, i'm fully aware, there are some problems with this anim\u00e9, \\n\r\nfor example the inconsistence of Homuras magic in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut these are minor problems compared to the join, this show brought me.\\n\r\nSo i'm totally willing to overlook these glitches.",

            "content": "This show is absolute trash. People try to say it is good just because of the poorly written plot twist at the climax of the story. The shows narrative is complete garbage, switching from one characters insecurities to the despair of homura due to madokas ignorance; with almost no transition. In the end nothing changes. This show tries so hard to be something that its not. Which only makes it worse overall. The ending provides no resolution to the story at all, instead just making it worse. This show ruined the magical girl genre. \r\nThe art is terrible, the scenes where they fight witches areawful. It looks like a 3-year old played with crayons over their frames. Like seriously what were they going for with that. People think its abstract so it must be a masterpiece. These people do not know what GOOD art is.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is mediocre at best, and even then its not that great. There are a few good background tracks, however apart from this the show again fails to deliver in yet another category. Definitely not as bad as the other though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are boring and 1-dimensional. Madoka has no depth to her at all despite being the main character. She doesnt change throughout the entire show, forcefully re-arriving at the same outcome, despite how hard Homura tries to stop her. She learns nothing and doesn't grow as a result of that, she instead remains a dumb little girl. How is this a masterpiece? It isnt.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who actually think this show is good are suffering from cognitive dissonance right about now. Trying to argue otherwise is like trying to detect brain activity in a Madoka fan. You cant. You could say Madoka herself is the personification of her fans, brainless and steadfast. Please take a hard look, and see this show for what it really is. That one edgy emo kid you hate for thinking they are big and bad but in reality they are pretty lame.",

            "content": "\"My desire to save you: the first emotion I had that started this all. And now that I've come this far, the only star left that will help guide my way... You don't have to understand. My words don't have to resonate within you. But still, I beg you. Let me protect you.\"\r\nMaybe its how Shaft grabbed me visually, perhaps its how unique it is to the rest of its genre, but when I finally decided to give the Magical Girl genre a chance again by watching Madoka\u2605Magica, I was rewarded with one of the greatest animes of its time, one that tears apart thestereotypes of Mahou Shoujo and creates from the ashes a breath of fresh air that made me ponder the very ideas of morality, power and most of all, the bittersweet tragedy of sacrifice itself. Normally I would break it down for individual ratings, but once, here is an exception, because it would take me an entire booklet to describe its intricacy. That day when I picked it from a shelf will be the day I consider a turning point in my belief.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I remember when I first collected the anime from a convention. Normally I avoid Mahou Shoujo's because frankly, the frills, sweet, moe characters with magical powers created by wishes or whatever wasnt appealing to me. It always seemed like a genre meant for 13 year old girls that wanted hope and a new world to entrance in, and being an 18 year old university student...thats rather embarrassing. Suddenly, it was in my hands...and so without much to care for, I watched the first episode, and from then on, I knew that this was the one that would change my perception completely. I saw black darkness and checkered beauty all within the dream of the girl who would become the main protagonist later on. In only 5 minutes, my perceptions of the Mahou Shoujo genre was shattered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat shocked me most though was the intricacy of the storyline itself. Unlike Naruto or other \"big\" anime that constantly drag me to hell with fillers, this was a delightful exception, with every minute of the storyline leaving me on the edge of my seat, weaving the basket of plot thicker and thicker as our curiosity increases at what will happen next. There are no \"fillers\",  you cannot skip an episode or you have basically missed out on a large chunk of the story for that. That is what makes it so perfect, its execution, but not only that, its sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Madoka\u2605Magica entranced me and thrust the series deeper into the world of psychological manipulation in terms of twisting my soul into pure emotion as time progresses. In fact, I even downloaded the OST and discovered my favourite interpretation of \"Ave Maria\" by Charles Gounod, interpreted by the legendary Kajiura Yuki, whose use of the violin moved me to tears by its intense feeling. Not even being roundhouse kicked in the face years back made me cry, so that says enough really.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, I had to get used to it, but then again, the characters were bubbly too, and speaking of that, after only 3 episodes, I felt like I was watching a different anime entirely, the character development being just so deep in such a short span of time, that it is almost impossible to top. \\n\\n\r\nIve never been a fan of the overly bubbly (unless its  K-On!!), and picking this up, I expected disappointment. Yet now I realise how wrong I was, and my only regret was that I didn't give this a chance sooner. I smiled, I was thrilled, I felt my emotions tingle and at times even teared up, and although Im hopeful that the Anime industry can continue to produce perfect worlds like the one created here, but in this genre, I doubt I will ever see something this beautifully perfect again, and although it only spanned 12 episodes, I have nothing but fulfillment from this, and cannot wait to see the trilogy of movies airing soon. 10/10, and well deserved.\\n\\n\r\n~Katsuro-chan",

I think that the story is very \"realistic\" hypotetically talking, because if this would happen in the reality, this is how it would be like.\\n\\n\r\nFor the artistic part, i think that the way witches were drawn for me were very great(the abstract form really worked), and the rest were fine, i dont usually critic this kind of things\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, were really great, how they related with each other, and the conections (especially of homura and madoka, of course). but if i have to stress the personally story of one of the girls, i would say sayaka.(if you watch it you will know why)\\n\\n\r\nAnd of the ending, i have to say that i didnt expected it,but liked it.And i think no sequels should be made, because its not a story to keep on writing about, and if it continues, it will lose the sense (However, if there is a spin-off or another diferent story, fine by me)\\n\\n\r\nFinally, to sum up, i really recomend it, as of me i loved it, the story is very strong and catching, and you will want to talk of it with another friend as soon as you finish it.\\n\\n",

Some weren't for the silly reason of 'different' magical girl anime already existing. To that, I say, are you high or what? God forbid new, interesting content. It's not a goddamn competition.\r\nEven being told it was dark and grim and whatnot didn't entirely prepare me for a totally different pacing, lack of comedy (usually present in this genre), amazingly well put-together story and in general something that many, if not most anime don't have - constant continuity and succeeding at it.\r\nThough exceptionally moein their design, the characters aren't as cute as they are simply well fleshed out. You simply can't look at them as cute after you get to know them better, because their personalities make them take on that form of beauty. If you ever truly had friends or anything, you're supposed to know the fuck I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, anyone who says Madoka\u2605Magica is overrated is either in delusion, or a hipster because like I said, the fact it's different doesn't mean all other different things are worse. Get off your high horse and enjoy the goddamn ride.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica doesn't need an introduction. Airing in 2011, the anime took the world by storm, having an unorthodox twist to the magical girl genre (to people who don't really know much about the magical girl genre, but I digress) in that it was incredibly brutal, lacked the usual plot armor that magical girl anime are infamous for, and it's more complex themes, ranging from Faust to selfishness vs. selflessness as well as finding salvation when there is nothing left.\r\nThere are mild spoilers in this review, but I've managed to avoid spoiling anything that isn't already known to the average person capable oflooking at the official art on the page and anyone who hasn't already heard about the series' reputation.\\n\r\nThat being said, proceed with some caution.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't much that we have seen before on a basic level, but becomes more multi-layered and complex as it goes along. The show has high re-watch value simply to watch all the pieces of the plot mash together, and boy do they mash together very well. The show remains thematically consistent in its message until the ending, while not providing any answers to most of the themes, leaving the a lot of aspects up to interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that, well, the show's story isn't as fleshed out as it could have been. A lot of aspects are left unexplained and undeveloped, from the point where magical girls always existed (which brings the question of when and how relevant they are to anything) to the point where you wonder why none of the wishes made when a person makes a wish are in any way similar to the wishes that occur over the course of the show, specifically near the ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is filled with plot holes like this, and you truly wonder if they edited out parts explaining such ideas in favor of cramming the story into 12 episodes. A lot of the world-building feels rushed and confused, which is a shame considering that the story as a whole is quite good, but doesn't reach the amount of depth and interest that it could've reached.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is another minor concern over the course of the show, as I find it unable to fully express the emotions of the various characters, and couldn't help but feel that with a more human appearance, I would've been more emotionally involved.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the art-style was supposed to fool people about the kind of show this is, but it nevertheless doesn't really work in this kind of show in my opinion. The show's character designs are a factor that stand in the way of humanizing the characters completely, since a lot of their facial expressions are indistinguishable from one another and hardly change.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is absolutely beautiful and the direction is incredibly well-done, with some absolutely gorgeous backdrops and a lot of amazing scenery throughout the show. The developers put a lot of care in bringing the setting to life, and it truly shows over the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting is exceptionally done and fits the characters well, and becomes absolutely chilling later on in the show. Sayaka's voice actress in particular did an absolutely fantastic job in bringing the character to life, and Eri Kitamura deserves full credit for managing to change from happy to sad to angry so effectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub is atrocious and forgettable, and I recommend avoiding that like the plague. The Japanese voice over has more passion and care put into it than the dub, and I couldn't help but feel while watching the dub that the voice actors were trying way too hard to sound like their Japanese counterparts rather than voice the characters in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is excellent as well, bringing some absolutely amazing tracks that are on my phone and frequently listen to. The ending song, Magia, is high on my all time favorite ending songs of all time, and the opening is surprisingly fitting, strangely enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my biggest problem with Madoka Magica; they are simplistic and mainly serve as tools to serve the plot, rather than the other way around. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, of course, but I couldn't help but feel that the story is why they're so popular rather than them standing as characters on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThey're so defined by the plot that they feel like plot points rather than characters, with very simplistic traits and conflicts (although the character conflicts are engaging in the context of the story) and don't stand on their own in any way. Again, this isn't a bad thing, but I couldn't help but feel that they were way too simple-minded for something that they're supposedly putting their lives on the line for.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka is a major exception to this flaw, and her character relationships with everyone in the show and her own character conflict was a joy to watch and easily the best part of the show. I don't quite understand the hate on her character to be honest, she's the character who felt the least like a plot device and felt the most human and dynamic out of the entire cast.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Madoka Magica greatly, don't get me wrong. It's a very solid show which is consistent from start to finish and is engaging and very easy to recommend to most people. I couldn't help but feel, however, that it's hype has more to do with the gruesome elements in the show rather than other elements more worthy of attention, and that many aspects of the show are underappreciated by the fanbase.\\n\\n\r\nI nevertheless recommend it, as I believe it's something most anime fans will find some enjoyment in.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, an anime which certainly became a real something during this season, has finally came to conclusion. One may say that conclusions are often parts that kills a good anime, but with this particular one we have a bit of a different story... However, let just start from the very begginning.\r\nAt first, we see the lovely story of Madoka, a typical ordinary girl, representing the stereotypical cute anime character - pink hair, ribbon, shool outfit and rather not too tall. With all that charm, she is drawn in a way that rather prevents her from being described as moe, but this isnot quite a problem in here. The main misfortune is the fact, that among all characters, the main one is the worst one. She is just warmly-hearted, one-dimensional girl, that seems to be existing just to keep the plot going.\\n\\n\r\nWell, what is the plot? As the title indicates, it is focused on the topic of magical girls, although there are quite not the same as in the most anime of its kind. In this one, the whole procedure of becoming mahous shoujo or puella magi, as you like, is telling your wish to Kyubey - a weird, but adorable cat-like creature, who has mouth, but never opens it while it speaks - and it grants it for the repayment of you starting a risky life as the magical girl, spending whole days on hunting the evil witches. The entire thing starts when the main character and her friend Sayaka meets Kyubey being chased by another character, Akemi Homura. It soon turns out that the cute monster wants to make contracts, as earlier described, with the two protagonists. The third one however, the mysterious Homura, wants to stop them from proceeding in this way. The reasons for her doing so and many other unknown facts concerning the true nature of magical girls in this universe are being revealed to us in the following episosed, making the whole plot much more complicated and darker than in any other anime of this kind. As many people claim, this is certainly not an anime for children. Althought the very begginning does not suggest it, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica has some very thrilling moments in it and is in fact overloaded with a hard, dreading climate.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is certain is that the audiovisual side of this anime is the factor that instantly keeps this climate going. Even if the plot is not very appalling itself, the way it is presented keeps the viewer's attention without any delays. The feeling that \"something\" may instantly happen is following you all the time as you keep watching the show. The music fits perfectly to the scenes, the opening is just great and the way in which this anime was drawn makes it even more appealing and outstanding, especially if you keep comparing it to the other mahou shoujos.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, despite how great this anime is, it still has a couple of drawbacks. As I already mentioned, the most annoying thing is the main hero. She really is the less interesting thing in the whole anime and despite her being the title character, one can argue that the whole show could even proceed without her at all. Apart from Madoka, there are not really many characters and the one that I most enjoyed is Homura. Always cool and mysterious, but having a completely different nature on the other hand, as it is revealed later on. She is the only non-one-dimensional character and the only one that you can at least sympathise with as far as I am concerned. Moreover, another problem with this anime, which I indicated on the beggining of this review, is the way it actually ends. I do not want to give you any spoilers, but I guess it is fair enough to warn you to not expect anything extraordinary. I had some hypothesis along before watching the final episodes and I was in fact closely enough with one of them and I did not find the ending scene that surprising. One may have other feelings regarding it, but in my opinion the last part was not that great as the rest of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how is it overall? If I have to sum it up, it is a very enjoyable anime overall. It has some cons regarding the characters and the ending is not that good as it could possibly be, but it still it a great piece to watch and I really liked the way it outstands on the background of its genre. I feel awkwardly sorry about the fact I cannot give it the highest score, but this does not change the fact that is a truly amazing thing to watch. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "After having just watched the finale on livestream, I must say that any attempt to be objective will fail at this point.  Shaft has delivered one of the most unique magical girl show ever in my mind.\r\nIt starts out like any other magical girl show, a quick glimpse in the daily routine of the main characters of the show.  The machinations of magic are quickly introduced, giving us time to be able to digest part of the world of Magical Girls before the first twist occurs.  From here on out, we catch a glimpse of a parallel plot and subtle foreshadowing, whilebeing explained of the truth of the Magical Girl.  All this was but a set up for Madoka's final decision as the story draws to a close, with nary a gaping plot hole in sight.\\n\\n\r\nShaft's first anime original has given them a lot of liberties to take.  The most striking is perhaps the Witches, each given their own theme and d\u00e9cor.  It is wide and varied, along with the architectural porn on display.  Not to mention some of the cinematographic choices in lighting and camera angles which adds subtle accentuations to the scenes.  However, the broadcast episodes do suffer in quality at some points; the characters looking slightly off.  Shaft is notorious for this but it is not to say that it detracts too much from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound as well is given great attention to detail.  The themes are simple yet easily bolster an already powerful scene.  Whether it is the hopeful rescue in the first episode or the sorrow and regret preceding the fall from grace.  Again, special mention goes to the sound effects of Witches and their minions.  Contrasting their horrific appearances with cheery laughs or a distortion thereof really completes what they are.  The voice work is a non-issue.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, once again a master stroke.  The cast were able to perform their functions in terms of plot and still have characterisation, changing over the course of the series.  This mostly applies to the main characters like Madoka but there was still attention paid to the minor ones like her mother.  Admittedly, I thought some were more plot-drivers than actual characters.  We are given enough to be able to feel somewhat strongly for the characters because of this.  For the Magical Girls though, the feeling is mostly of sympathy.  Even the quiet Homura is not what she initially appears to be and could arguably be the protagonist with along Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nAfter writing this much it'd be impossible to say I haven't enjoyed Madoka at all.  From deciphering the runic alphabet to recognising famous landmarks of the world present in Mitakihara, it was a fun ride, speculating on even the smallest details as the show ran its course.  The fact that this was an anime original that was trying to do something different only adds to the satisfaction.  If you can't at least recognise that, you think too highly of yourself.  And remember, the contract was always worth the price.",

            "content": "I was skeptical coming into this series. After showing me the trailer on Youtube, my friend laughed and remarked that the trailer was \"perfect\". It was simply a show about cute magical girls, he assured me. Being outside the conventional targeted demographic for this such a genre, I was very dubious of whether I would enjoy such an anime. However, since his recommendations had never led me wrong before, I decided to give it a try and started watching it with him.\r\nBy the first episode I was somewhat intrigued. The characters all seemed fairly likable, if not coming off as a little juvenile, considering theyare in middle school. The production and animation of the show was also demonstrably well-done which certainly made it more engaging to watch. However, the component that really piqued my interested were the witch fights and their bizarre and trippy animations. I really enjoyed watching those scenes and experiencing somewhat of a sensory overload as various, indiscriminate objects haphazardly wrapped around the screen and the textures and colors came to life. I did my best to try and describe these scenes, but really there is no substitute for viewing them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWe continued with two more episodes, and throughout I found that the exposition (where the laws of this universe are gradually explained to the viewer) was nicely intertwined with action sequences and the further revealing of character motives and backstories. I watched this show in early 2014, long after it had already been released, and looking back now, I consider myself very lucky that I had managed not to overhear anything about this wildly popular show. Due to this, I was entirely unprepared for the bombshell twist that was dropped on me at the end of episode 3. It was so unexpected that I nearly lost my head at how sudden a development this was. In my opinion, shock value in media can be done either very well or very poorly. Let Puella Magi Madoka Magica be a textbook example of it done flawlessly. I had originally come for the trippy presentations of the witch fights, but now I was definitely staying for the story.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the ensuing episodes, which glue the rapidly advancing plot together quite nicely, I was beginning to understand that this was a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Not being very well versed in the genre played straight, my only regret is that I had not watched some conventional magical girl anime beforehand so that I could better compare and contrast. Nevertheless, the writing is enthralling enough that it shouldn't matter too much for viewers without much previous experience with genre.\\n\\n\r\nThen we come to episode ten. There are too many brilliant factors to cover comprehensively in this acclaimed episode, so I will only talk about a few. We finally gain some semblance of a true understanding in regard to what is happening in the plot through very smart and angled storytelling that allows us to sympathize with several of the characters (trying my best to be vague in the interest of avoiding spoilers). Through this, I found it very hard to not perceive the sadness and sense of hopelessness that was so heavily percolating from the storyline. It is here that mask comes completely off and this anime reveals the full extent of its dark undertones for the whole world to see. And at the end when the opening credits play, and then the lyrics start to make sense... saying I was touched would be putting it much too lightly. I have to admit, I consider this episode of Puella Magi Madoka Magica to be the single greatest episode in television anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, while considered controversial by some, in my opinion put a very satisfactory ending to this magnificent and breathtaking tale. The ending was not some thoughtless, happy-go-lucky fairy tale ending, but more of an intellectual and thought-provoking close to the story that caused me to parse and ponder its true ramifications for weeks to come; and that's just the way I like 'em. With dazzling and intriguing visuals, a great and emotional soundtrack, and writing on a level that I have not yet seen another anime match, I can't recommend this series enough. But if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you didn't read too much into my review. Go watch it now, and just keep in mind the wise words of my friend: \"After all, it's just a show about cute magical girls.\"",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a masterpiece. I've rewatched this anime 5 times and can say that with utmost certainty. Why is it a masterpiece you might ask? You'll really have to see for yourself, but I CAN tell you why it's worth watching.\r\n- \r\nLet's start with...the story which I give a 10 overall. (Some spoilers for episode 1. I recommend watching it first if you care.) \r\nMadoka Kaname is your average middle school girl. One day, a new student transfers to her class.\r\nThat same day, after school, she's hanging out with her friend when they end up encountering a magical familiar named Kyubey, whois being attacked by said transfer student. \\n\\n\r\nAfterwards, Kyubey offers to grant them any wish that they desire. In exchange they must become magical girls and fight witches. \\n\\n\r\nSo far it seems like a regular magical girl series, right? \\n\r\nMagical familiar (\u2713)\\n\r\nMagical girls/magic being used (\u2713)\\n\r\nEnemies they must defeat (witches) (\u2713)\\n\\n\r\nThis could just be Cardcaptor Sakura or something! But that's where your wrong. The darker undertones are already there. \\n\\n\r\nNear death of magical familiar (\u2713)\\n\r\nTerrifying enemies (\u2713)\\n\r\nBitter rivalry between magical girls (\u2713)\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where this show differs from \"your average magical girl anime\". You probably already know this, but the show is a psychological thriller for a freaking reason. \\n\r\nThe world of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a perilous place and things are not what they seem. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime may seem happy-go-lucky for the first few episodes, but these things are present all the time. And as you go on, you'll see them become more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the art. This gets a 9 from me. The art style is very unique. The character designs are a bit simplistic, but they're charming. All the main characters can be associated with their own color since their eye and hair colors are the same and they each have their own style as well, making them distinct as characters. The backgrounds are really beautiful and creative (especially during fight scenes). The animation is really smooth as well. I don't really have any complaints, honestly. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the music. It gets a 10. The soundtrack of this show is absolutely amazing. From the opening (which stays the same the entire show) to the numerous ending themes. I've found they're all very fitting. Especially when you analyze the lyrics of these themes. The various characters also have their own character themes which fit their personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the characters. They all get a 10. All of the main characters feel almost alive. You can really feel yourself rooting for them at times and in my opinion, each and every one of them has an equally important role in the series and they make this anime the masterpiece it is. I won't say more to keep this review less spoiler-y.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment and overall opinion of this anime is a flat out 10. Sure I may be a bit biased, having watched it 5 times, but it may just be my favorite anime. I hope my review convinced you that you need to watch it (if you haven't already). Have a nice day! :)",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is not your standart magical girl show, but you probaby already know that because \"Not your typical magical girl show\" is the most oftenly used phrase to describe this anime. Still it is true nonetheless.\r\nThe show is a rather unusual and dramatic twist on an everyday magical girl show. The main word being dramatic. There are fights, transformations and monsters but the thing this show dedicates most attention to is drama. A well written and for the most part beautifly executed drama. The show takes a huge advantage of the protagonists being 14 or so year old girls to explore the psychology ofteens and how they can balance and swiftly change between bright hope and endless despair. I can boldly call this anime a master of controlling and manipulating the mood, atmosphere and the undertones to it's advantage to make you feel just what the show wants you to feel. Rarely I have seen the show knowing just what buttons to push and when to tell an deep, adult and intruiging story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother word that I would use to describe the story would be gripping. Now people throw that word to left and right like it is nothing and I don't think we should treat it that way. I have seen many good and interesting anime shows which were not neccerely gripping. Madoka Magica is really what I can call a gripping show. The episodes flow into each other flawlessly and always make you want to watch more without using the cheap tactics like awful cliffhangers at the end of the episode which did not really bring anything cool in the following episode but were impemented only for you to turn on the next epsode.\\n\\n\r\nThe reasons for being that gripping is that the pacing of the show is near flawless after the first 2 episodes. As I said the story flows with no filler and no time spent on unneccery things. The dialoges are well written and the voice actors did an outstanding job. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also had a memorable soundtrack with nice opening and amazing ending. And that says a lot because I mostly skip my endings even if the song is not bad. The reason that the ending stands out is not only because of the song (Which is wonderful) but because of the way it was implemented and how the last scenes smoothly flow into the said ending. The original soundtrack itself always helps create a special mood and is subtle when needed and energyzing when the scene demands it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is superb. There are not as many fight scenes as one would hope but they are all animated and stylized in a great fashion. The style change when the protagonists fight witches is imaginative and always cool to look at. Still this anime often reuses the same shots of character animations especially in dialoge. It is more apperent in the second half of the show. Still it looks more like a directing technique than the means to save some budget.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom here the review enters the spoiler section because to explain the things I did not like about the show I need to get more in depth into the story. If you have not watched this anime I urge you to do so and I also urge you to avoid any and all spoilers concerning it because it can really ruin the whole experience for you.\\n\\n\r\nNow it is time to discuss the things I did not like about the show and really all of them come from the last 4 or so episodes. To tell the truth the frist 8 episodes are near flawless and are a 9 or 10 out of 10 material. I can't say the same thing about the rest of the show. It was still rather good but not as good as what preceeded it at least in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI will start with a small nitpick which is the thing I personaly find a bit silly. The fact that the universe runs on the energy which is collected by aliens by giving young girls powers to turn into magical girls and then gather even more energy from their despair as they turn into witched is a bit silly to me. Yes it is a magical girls show and this kind of thing does not seem that much of a silly concept for the genre but this show had a completely different tone. Still it may just be me.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problems I have with this show started with the show introducing us to the information that one of the protagonists is a time traveler and that she has relieved this events many time already to try to get the different outcome but she always failed and went back in time to relieve these events again to try to fix things and make the outcome different. First of all it is rather dumb that she has the powers of complete time travel but only travels to a single perioud of time. I think anyone would think of going back a little further than a few weeks to try to fix things after you have failed numerious times. The anime did not set any limitations on her powers so it is not like she can travel only to that set time a few weeks ago. Often she failed only because the events she tried to stop from happenening already started happening at that time she returned to. You would think she had enough brians to go a bit further into the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the whole show till the end was just another timeline she traveled really and I mean REALLY undermined the events that happened before we were introduced to this twist. I mean why should I care if I knew that she could and did come back in time so that the events happened in a different way? The first part of the show starts feeling rather unimportant even though it was much better than the last few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem I have is the ending. I was left unsatisfied with it and it produced close to no impact on me. It leaves many questions and answeres close to none of them. The protagonist becomes a sort of \"God\" and just waves her hand to fix everything and make everything good...well at least it would be good if she actually thought the wish through. While better, what she wished for was not really a good solution to the problem.\\n\\n\r\nAlso one thing. The collosal potential of the main protagonist is explained as following. The more impact the magical girl has on the fate of the world and ETC the more powerful she becomes. But following that logic the time traveling protagonist should wield far greater power. She has the power to travel through time and basicly holds the fate of the unverse in her hands to some extent and it is only because of her obsession that  the main protagonist has this much of an impact of the fate of the universe. In reality the timetraveler is the one who has a much bigger impact. I mean the universe has repeated the same few weeks a dozzen times just because she wanted to save her friend.\\n\\n\r\nStill all of that issues may not bug you at the end of the day, but they did bug me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth overall I stil highly enjoyed the show, especially the first 8 or so episdoes. I can't be mad at this show beacuse in it's first half alone it accomplished more than a huge chunk of shows do in their long 26 or more episode run. The ending was not straight up horrible. Even though the idea was rather dumb in my opinion, it was executed very well. I still HIGHLY reccomend this show to anybody and urge you all to watch it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Magical Girls. When someone says that word nowadays, many people think of one series, this series, Madoka*Magica. Across the web, this title is heralded as a great series, but is it really?\r\nThe story of this series starts off like most MG animes. However, unlike many series, the protagonist takes a very backseat role on the action. Actually, the protagonist barely even fights. Its up to the other girls to carry her weight around, but when all they're talking about is the protagonist and she does not do anything of value, the plot suffers. The entire story is practically built around her and since she doesnothing of value for more than 3/4 of the series, the plot loses a lot of its meat. It has a good concept where there are consequences to the MGs and their presence, but the characters themselves rob it of its power. The ending is also very anticlimatic. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the series has a sketchy quality, yet the animations are crisp. That being said, the colors and abstract art that comes from the enemies, the 'witches' is blinding and it was hard to follow the action through all the kaleidoscope-like images. Character designs are good, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting matches the characters, and the BGM is strong as well. The opening and ending are good enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fault with this series are its characters. The main girl is a whiny girl who wants to be a MG but...doesn't want to be a MG? Her convicts and beliefs change by the second. She does not seem to get her ducks in a row until the end. Her friends are about as deep as a dried up kiddie pool in summer, with the exception of Mami and Kyubey. One is a MG who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and is doing the best she can. The other is a mastermind. I won't say more for fear of spoilers...Sadly, because of the rest of the cast and how they rely on Madoka to pull her share, they all fail in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode was a test of my conviction to finish this series. I nearly gave up several times and when I finally completed it, I felt as though I got nothing for my effort. I won't recommend this to anyone who wants a series with any notable  male characters in it or with any females that give the typical anime girl a good name. The people who may enjoy are those who like this kind of genre no matter what, or those who can see past Madoka's faults. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is famous for reasons I just can't understand. The horrible cast, weak Madoka-centered plot and bad ending render this show overly hyped and nearly a waste of my time. Watch at your own risk.",

            "content": "Before submitting this I would like you all to note that this review will contain spoilers. I'm am reviewing this assuming you have seen the series or don't care about spoilers, so read with caution. Also, this review will be very long. If you want my opinion without being spoiled, then yes, go watch this anime, I believe it is great. \r\nSo, this is my first review, so bear with me. I came into Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (MSMM from now on) quite skeptical, as I can imagine many others would be. I never have been the biggest Shaft fan in the world nor thebiggest mahou shoujo fan. I decided to pick it up solely for one reason and that was the involvement of Gen Urobuchi as the scriptwriter. Did I regret it? Absolutely not. MMSM has the potential to go on to be the best series released this year, if not one of my favourites of all time. I have allowed the ending to digest and now here I am reviewing it. I cannot stress enough, most of this review comes down to my speculation, and serves not only as a review, but also as an analysis of the series as a whole. Feel free to disagree with any observations I make. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMMSM's story is mostly about subverting the mahou shoujo genre. It does this by subverting, or altering, certain tropes commonly found within mahou shoujo and by allowing the show to have a much darker setting than that normally found within this genre. It also includes both religious and psychological differences. The story stars Madoka, a typical Japanese teenage girl. One day, she has a dream about a girl fighting some giant unseen monster. The girl is clearly outmatched. Madoka then decides to agree to a contract with some little white hairball. At this point Madoka wakes up. When she arrives at school, to her shock she sees the same girl from her dream, named Homura, joining her class as a transfer student. Later in that day, Madoka is with her friend Sayaka when she hears a telepathic call for help. Rushing to the help of the person who called her, she finds the hairball from her dream, named Kyuubey, being attacked by Homura. When she rushes to his help, both she and Sayaka are attacked by a monster, known as a witch. A girl called Mami, a mahou shoujo (or puella magi, depending on whether you use the Japanese or Latin translations for 'Magical Girl') come to their rescue, at which point both are recruited by Kyuubey to become mahou shoujo, in exchange for one wish, in order to fight witches for the remainder of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nMSMM incorporates religious symbolism and themes from both Buddhism and Christianity. Most notable are the Buddhism references. The ideas of balance play a vital role in what it means to be a mahou shoujo. Though there wish brings happiness, the mahou shoujo's must be burdened by the equal and opposite despair caused by their wish, so that the balance is preserved. It is this which makes becoming a mahou shoujo an unappealing prospect. However, in the beginning, becoming a mahou shoujo seems a rewarding experience. Not only do you get a free wish, borderline a miracle, you also get cool magical powers and you get to help people. However, it quickly becomes apparent that being a mahou shoujo isn't a pleasant prospect. Mami, who's wish is to keep living, is killed by a witch. Sayaka, who's wish is to heal the man she loves, ends up losing him. Kyouko, who's wish is to help his father's preachings, causes him to go mad in anger and murder her entire family when he realises just what she has done. These buddhist ideals of balance and karma play a vital role in just what it means to become a mahou shoujo and are also relevant to the plot. Ultimately, each and every mahou shoujo must pay the inevitable price of their wishes and all the lives they have saved, by becoming witches themselves in order to spread this despair, while the creation of witches helps to starve off the heat death of the universe. \\n\\n\r\nChristian references also play a part in MSMM, but only towards the end of the show and in the conclusion. In the climax of the show, Madoka becomes a mahou shoujo and her wish is to stop the creation of wishes entirely. Ultimately, she uses her own immense power, rather than that of Kyuubey's to take the despair of each and every mahou shoujo so they don't become witches and just die. This ties in with the Buddhism references mentioned earlier, as Madoka now has to burden the taint and despair of every mahou shoujo that has ever existed. However, in turn she effectively becomes a deity. Her very existence is erased, as if she had never been born and everybody forgets about her (save for one character... and possibly more depending on how you are willing to speculate on the ending). What prominent Christian figure do we know of who 'died' and was reborn as God? These symbols are further prominent by the fact that Kyuubey throughout the series tells Madoka that she has the ability to become as powerful as a God. As a result, those who had died throughout the course of the series are reborn. Witches no longer exist but instead are replaced by demons, hinted at being born from the darkness in the world, or possibly anomalies from the taint Madoka is forced to bear. In this world, mahou shoujo are forced to fight these demons. These demons drop 'grief cubes' instead of the grief seeds dropped by witches, which are harvest by the Incubators in order to continue to starve off the heat death of the universe. In this world, Homura's ability has changed, she now wields a bow, similar to Madoka and we see her with Angel like wings as she descends to fight the demons. From what I have speculated, Madoka has taken the Christian perspective of a God. That is, an omnipotent deity who has altered the laws of the universe. Homura, being confirmed as the only one who remembers the world as it was, is Madoka's Angel. Her wish, which was originally to protect Madoka, has become null and void, and as a result she fights for the protection of the world. She has been given power by God (Madoka's bow) in order to protect the world Madoka so desperately wanted to save, inheriting Madoka (or God's) will. This explains the brief glimpse of wings we see behind Homura. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that psychological references are also present in this series. Mahou Shoujo are picked as they 'enter their second growth phase' as Kyuubey calls it. In other words, puberty. Puberty is a stressing time for all who go through it. For many teenagers it leads to depression. For each of the Mahou Shoujo, they go through a similar phase which can be mirrored in real life (without the magical powers, fighting of supernatural beings and inevitable outcome of becoming a witch, of course). Each of them become Mahou Shoujo around the age of puberty and each of them become emotionally depressed due to the burden of despair that they must carry. This can be paralleled with the growing into an adult that each and everyone of us have, or will, experience. What happens to the Mahou Shoujo (ignoring the supernatural stuff), starting off proud, on top of the world, and then falling into depression, can be mirrored almost accurately with teenagers in our world. Proud of our changes, becoming adults, something we look forward to, and then due to hormonal issues, becoming depressed, unhappy and surly teenagers. \\n\\n\r\nMSMM suffers from what I call, the curse of the one cour. This seems to effect a lot of anime that are 11 - 13 episodes long. MSMM has pacing issues. For example, Sayaka's descent into darkness takes up one entire third of the anime, yet it still feels rushed, incomplete and too a point, forced. In my opinion, MSMM would definitely benefit from an addition 2 to 5 episodes, but then again, nothing can be perfect. \\n\\n\r\nMSMM has references to other popular sources, most notably Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a novel which tells the story of a man who makes a deal with the Devil who later comes to regret it (similar to how the girls make a deal with Kyuubey, who also later come to regret it). I could tell you about all the Faust references throughout the show, but it's much more fun to let you find them yourself. I'm sure there's a few I've missed out on as well. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI am by no means the biggest Shaft fan when it comes to art. The stereotypical Shaft headtilts are present in abundance, faces are abnormally wide and the girls come across as very 'moe'. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't mean the art style in general is bad. Not by a long shot. In fact, in a lot of ways, it is very cleverly used. For example, colour is an important part of the mahou shoujo genre, particularly bright colours, yellows, pinks, blues, normally associated with specific characters. MSMM is no exception, but it goes about it in a clever way to show that it is different from your typical mahou shoujo. Though the characters still have specific colours to them (Sayaka - Blue, Madoka - Pink, Mami - Yellow) these colours are presented in more subdued shades instead of bright colours. A clever way to help the series blend in with the darker pallet of the scenery as well as being faithful to the mahou shoujo genre while subverting it at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nAnother example of the art style being used cleverly is in the town where they live. This town is pristine and almost bland, with tall towers and classrooms made of glass. Everything is organised. These contrast very heavily within the world of the witches barriers, where everything is abstract and different. This makes our first foray into a witches barrier disorientating and makes every subsequent visit a surprise and as a result, we almost look forward to seeing what the next barrier will look like. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, just for giggles, pick two episodes at random and watch the openings side by side. See what changes you can pick out as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\n Sound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the music in MSMM is fantastic. The themes for each of the characters are incredible, the opening is deliciously deceptive (in order to trick us into what sort of show we are watching) and the ending is dark and dreary (held off intentionally from beginning until episode three).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nTime for another long section. I'm going to break this up into each of the main cast: Madoka, Homura, Sayaka, Mami, Kyouko and Kyuubey. \\n\\n\r\nMadoka-\\n\\n\r\nMadoka is an example of the subversion of the genre that MMSM fulfills. In the mahou shoujo genre, the main character takes the center stage. Her powers are often exceptional and she often saves the day. As a result, many of the supporting cast can be shadowed by her. Madoka is different. Infact, we don't actually see Madoka as a magical girl until episode 10, and even then it's in an alternate timeline, despite the fact the opening and all the promotional material shows Madoka in her magical girl outfit. Madoka is in no way a cliche mahou shoujo protagonist. She isn't the hero until the very end. Her character is, for the most part, almost entirely useless and is borderline bland. Madoka eventually does become the hero in the end, however. Effectively, her character is one of the main reasons I call this show a subversion. \\n\\n\r\nHomura-\\n\\n\r\nHomura is a mystery from the beginning. Her character is shrouded in allusion. Despite the fact she often comes at odds with the other mahou shoujo in the series (as well as trying to murder Kyuubey) it's clear to see from the beginning that she isn't an antagonist. Her character is strong and mysterious. Eventually, we come to learn that she is a time traveler, her abilities allowing her to manipulate time. After Madoka is killed in Walpurgis Night (the coming of an immensely powerful witch, which occurs at the climax of the story), Homura's wish is to go back in time in order to relive the events in order to protect Madoka. However, she eventually learns that the mahou shoujo are doomed to become witches and that kyuubey has been tricking them in order to harness the energy they release when they become witches. Throughout numerous timelines, Homura tries to warn the other girls and protect them from Kyuubey, failing at each Walpurgis Night along the way. The constant failure and even murder she performs on Madoka (at her request to prevent her from becoming a witch) changes and hardens her personality. Homura, in particular, is the character that most emphasises the darker nature of the series, being forced to live time and time again to try and prevent Madoka's inevitable fate. One of the most moving scenes in the anime occurs when Homura comes clean to Madoka about her past and her wish, revealing part of the original Homura before she became a mahou shoujo. \\n\\n\r\nSayaka- \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose a favourite girl in this series, it would be Sayaka. Sayaka best represents the fall from grace that all mahou shoujo experience. She is the first of the girls that we see as a human, and throughout the series we see her become a mahou shoujo, make her wish, and slowly accumulate despair and eventually, inevitably become a witch. It is almost painful to watch. Sayaka has a crush on a boy named Kyousuke, who she often visits in hospital. Kyousuke was a talented violinist before an injury left him crippled. Sayaka eventually makes her wish to help Kyousuke so he can play music again, ignoring the advice of Mami, who says \"Do you want to make this wish to help him, or do you want to make it so he'll say thank you to you.\" Sayaka makes this wish and becomes a mahou shoujo. Originally, she is proud and happy to become one. She is happy she has helped her crush and happy of the role she fulfills as the protector of the town. However, two main catalysts lead to her fall as a character. The first is when she discovers that the souls of mahou shoujo are removed from their body and placed into soul gems. This leads to her growing disgust in herself and the belief that she is a 'zombie'. At this point she begins to realise that being a mahou shoujo isn't all sugar and roses. The second catalyst is when her friend, Hitomi, expresses a romantic interest in Kyousuke. Sayaka doesn't pursue Kyousuke because she believes she doesn't deserve him. She believes he deserves someone whole, and not someone like herself, who she considers a zombie. \"How can I hold him with these hands? How can I kiss him with these lips?\" Ultimately, her growing despair leads to her becoming a witch, and subsequently her death. There is a beautiful scene involving her witch which shows a subversion of a typical trope. In shounen and mahou shoujo anime, it is not uncommon for a good character to be brainwashed over to the bad side. This is often followed with a scene where the main character yells the other characters name and eventually they are brought out of their delusion by the 'power of friendship' or something similar. This is what Madoka tries to do when Sayaka becomes a witch. In any normal Mahou Shoujo, this would work, however, in MSMM, it fails miserably. Sayaka's character is easily the best to see the Buddhism references to balance and the flaws of being a mahou shoujo. Her death also shows us that mahou shoujo eventually become witches. She gets to the point where she will easily strike out against Madoka and her fall is painful to watch. Though it feels slightly rushed as I mentioned earlier, it is well done and a credit to the writing staff.\\n\\n\r\nMami- \\n\\n\r\nMami's main position as a character is to show us the good side of being a mahou shoujo and also to set off the chain reaction that leads to the series becoming what it is. For most of the first three episodes, the series seems cliche, it appears as a typical mahou shoujo anime. It isn't until Mami's death that the chain reaction occurs which allows us to view the anime in an entirely different light. Her death is not only surprising, but horribly gruesome. Mami is looked up to by both Madoka and Sayaka. Her character is their envisioned perspective of a mahou shoujo. She did not choose to become a mahou shoujo, but was rather forced to become one in order to save her own life. Her wish was not out of greed but was out of mere survival. She fights to defend the people of the town and puts the obtaining of grief seeds second to saving people. When Sayaka becomes a mahou shoujo, her goal is to become like Mami. Mami's character provides a vital role to the early part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nKyouko- \\n\\n\r\nKyouko, originally, serves as an almost exact contrast to Mami. Kyouko doesn't care about the lives of people, only obtaining grief seeds. The first time she meets Sayaka, she fights her for the control of the town. Kyouko doesn't come into the series until after Mami's death. It is also Kyouko who comes up with the idea of balance and how happiness and despair must equal out. Kyouko is violent, aggressive and ultimately portrays what a mahou shoujo shouldn't be like and what one normally isn't like in other mahou shoujo anime. Ultimately, we do see Kyouko's more humane side. Her wish was not a selfish one, but one to help her father. She doesn't like people wasting food and is often seen eating because of when she had starved earlier in her life. Her selfishness can be put down to self preservation, caring only for herself, due to the betrayal by her father and the loss of her family. She eventually, however, becomes attached to Sayaka, as she can see Sayaka making what she perceives to be mistakes, the same mistakes that she made, making a wish for someone else, wanting to help people. Kyouko is the only girl who dies of her own volition. She kills herself in a powerful attack to kill Sayaka's witch, stating that she doesn't want Sayaka to live alone. This shows us that Kyouko becomes emotionally attached to Sayaka, more than she is willing to reveal originally, even though they started out as enemies. \\n\\n\r\nKyuubey-\\n\\n\r\nIf MSMM has an antagonist, it is him. I wouldn't call him an antagonist either. In fact, the series lacks a true antagonist, as the witches themselves are essentially fallen magical girls, and even though they are the targets throughout the series, they can be pitied and we see the struggles they had to go through when they were human. The series lacks a true antagonist, another feature which sets it apart from other mahou shoujo anime. Kyuubey creates mahou shoujo and harvests the energy they release when they become witches. He does this in order to prevent the heat death of the universe. His race, the Incubators, have been doing this and influencing the life of man since prehistoric times. Though Kyuubey deceives magical girls, his motives are quite logical and noble. He intends to prevent the death of the universe. He compares his relationship with the girls as similar to that of humans and cattle, but only more humane, as he recognises humans as sentient and intelligent, whereas humans do not afford this same respect to livestock. Kyuubey cannot be perceived as an actual antagonist, he is emotionless and destroys the lives of girls, but he states that the life of one girl is insignificant compared to that of the entire universe and every living being in it. Kyuubey cannot be called an antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. I loved this anime enough to put enough thought into analysing it and coming up with my own interpretations of it. I love it enough to spend over an hour writing this review. I love the subtle symbolism to religion and human psychology, I love the characters, the voice acting is incredible as is the animation and by believe this is the best work by Gen Urobuchi, I could not recommend this anime enough, in the off chance that someone who hasn't seen it (or anyone for that matter) has read all of this. I hope I have managed to help some of you broaden your views on this anime and perhaps made you start to speculate what this series means for yourself. Ultimately, I could not recommend this anime enough.",

            "content": "The first thing you need to know about Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is that it is not as revolutionary as it wants you to think it is. Dark magical girl shows have been done before--Princess Tutu delved into some pretty heavy stuff, and Revolutionary Girl Utena (if you can even call it mahou shoujo) went...well, deeper. Action magical girl shows have been done before, Nanoha's probably the prime candidate for magical girl shootouts, but practically every popular magical girl show since Sailor Moon's been about throwing around magic for peace and justice. Even looking outside the mahou shoujo field, at deconstructions that throw young kidsinto terrifying situations, Narutaru and Bokurano had it down a long time ago, graphic evisceration and everything.\\n\\n\r\nSo then, what makes Madoka Magica special, you might ask? The answer is a little tricky to define. It's not so much about the gripping story, the brilliant art direction or the incredible music as it is all these elements working together as one coherent entity. If the viewer wasn't so caught up in the plot, he wouldn't miss the visual shortcuts. If he wasn't awed and frightened by the witch battles, he would see the rough patches where ambition perhaps outstrips technique. And in patches where the visuals are almost too quirky or the story going on weird faux-scientific tangents about entropy, Yuki Kajiura's soundtrack saves the day and distracts the listener just long enough to get back to the good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBut make no mistake--despite Akiyuki Shinbo's recognizable touch, this is Gen Urobuchi's piece, through and through. Considering Shinbo's other work, which have been almost totally overwhelmed every time by his own unique aesthetic, this is kind of a miracle.  When the gloves come off in episode three and one of the magical girls is decapitated, directly followed by the brilliant hard-rocking ending, designed to make anime nerds shell out money for Madoka Magica Bluray disks. That's a statement of intent, right there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Madoka Magica outdoes just about every show in 2011, its insane ambition. You see, Madoka Magica is not a show about magical girls. It is a show about the magical girl system, and the handful of poor scared girls thrown into its midst. It is a show where the scope of the horror increases every episode, and the true villain is always in doubt. The scariest thing of all is that the true villain may be the rules of the universe themselves. I mean, if you've seen the show, I know you laughed through Kyubey's entropy speech, but think about it for a second. What happened there was that the show contextualized itself yet again, as it does over and over again throughout the show. What starts out as a slightly twisted show about girls fighting Lovecraft horrors quickly becomes the struggles of under-prepared young people against the universe itself. You might be able to fight witches, asks Madoka Magica. But can you fight gravity?\\n\\n\r\nComplementing the deranged scope of the story is the fact that the folks over at SHAFT are in no way interested in padding the story with filler, like Sailor Moon or even Cardcaptor Sakura (no matter how brilliant the filler was in the latter.) There are no extraneous transformation scenes, no villains-of-the-week, no cut-and-paste enemies. Every witch is a marvel of surreal design, and every magical girl uniform says something about its owner. The fights on display are probably some of the most kinetic and interesting of any magical girl show ever made. Many would say that the fights are not the focus of magical girl shows, and I'd agree. But it's also true that in each clash with witches , no moments are wasted and no punches are pulled.\\n\\n\r\nSHAFT couples Madoka Magica with arguably the most restrained use of Shinbo's trademark aesthetic yet. Some might decry his work as being a step below Bakemonogatari in terms of visual creativity. I'd say, though, that while some of his earlier work flirts with visual craziness for the sake of visual craziness, Madoka Magica comes as close as I've ever seen him come to his style actually meaning something. Just the sheer difference between the wide-open spaces and futuristic architecture of the human world coupled with the cluttered paper-cutout world of the magical world conveys more than flashing text across the screen. Even though the latter effects could certainly entertain in his other work. Shinbo's style is coupled with a memorable soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura, which is by turns melancholic, whimsical and terrifying. Then, of course, there's the opening theme, which grows more poignant with each listen; and the ending theme, which is probably one of the greatest ending themes of all time. Magia is Madoka Magica's Cruel Angel Thesis, and it deserves a spot up there in the pantheon with it.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story aims for greatness, the visuals amaze despite the middling budget, and the music is phenomenal. Why isn't this anime a 10, then? It's probably the best show of 2011 that isn't named \"Wandering Son\", and should be watched by every self-respecting fan of Japanese animation out there.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are two things about Madoka Magica that I can see as significant problems. The first is that it is that, when you come down to it, it doesn't bring anything particularly new to the table, besides maybe Kyubey. The second is that the characters don't hold their weight. Despite the superbly constructed story, despite the art and sound, the characters themselves can be a little dull. Kyubey is brilliant, and makes for one of the best sort-of-antagonists of any anime in the past few years, but as for everybody else: Sakaya's fall of darkness happens too quickly, Mami leaves the picture before she experiences much development, Kyoko's change of heart happens too fast and her decision in episode 9 is frankly ridiculous, and Madoka herself spends most of the series in a tear-ridden stupor. Madoka's family actually succeeds as one of the most convincing representations of family in recent memory, but they ultimately play so little part in the storyline that it is a little frustrating. Madoka's dynamic with her mother was so warm that I expected her to play a larger role, but in the end her role was disappointingly minor. The fact that Madoka actually had a visible family, in contrast to just about every other heroine in the story, was something in itself, but the potential was ultimately squandered for something less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHomura, on the other hand, received an entire episode to herself, and ultimately became one of the most sympathetic characters in the show. So maybe I'm undervaluing the cast just a little bit. Compared to a show like Princess Tutu, where the main cast are all uniformly multilateral and tragic, the characters of Madoka Magica are lacking; but on the other hand, given the show's time limit and the scope that it pulls off, it is difficult to see how they could have had time to give everyone more development. More importantly, in contrast to other shows where the characters remain frustratingly static, the cast of Madoka actually go somewhere. Sayaka loses her ideals but holds true to them at the same time, Kyouko puts her life on the line for a friend, Homura learns a lesson about hope and Madoka, at the very end, like Shinji before her, gets on her feet and makes a difference.\\n\\n\r\n I think it says something that while the amount of development the characters go through isn't enormous, each of the characters in the show are developed just enough to remain sympathetic. They may be archetypes, but they aren't one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThere's plenty more to say about this show: the Buddhist overtones, the cosmic balance of happiness and despair, whether or not Kyouko and Sakaya were lesbians, the ending itself. But I think it deserves to be said that whatever Madoka Magica's faults, it's something special. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, what other magical girl show would have the guts to end the way it did? That's not commercial calculation, right there. Anno might have aimed for meaning at the end of Evangelion, and Rahxephon might have tried to synthesize that meaning into something palatable. But I think that Madoka's end, succeeds in dominating both of these shows. Considering Evangelion's weight, that's no mean feat.",

            "content": "This is my absolute all-time favorite anime, and I find it extremely hard to believe that anything could ever top it for me. It holds a very special place in my heart, and I cannot possibly praise it enough.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe level of believability, tragedy, and logic that this universe presents is astounding. The plot twists are shocking, heart-wrenching, and well-placed. 12 episodes seems to be too short of a time frame to deliver this drama, but the pacing is, in my opinion, perfect. The story will take you on a roller-coaster ride. And the ending... no words can possibly describe how much that endingmeant to me. The scale of it, the way it wraps everything up in the neatest bow you could find, the hope that it gave to me. I bawled for the entirety of the last episode, and couldn\u2019t be less ashamed. It\u2019s a perfect ending. Perfect is near impossible in fiction, but in my eyes, Madoka reaches that level. Not only did the story throw my emotions around like a chew toy, I believe that it gave me hope in reality as well. This show changed my life, and I cannot give it anything less than the highest respect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one place where I\u2019ve seen some criticism of the show, but I disagree with those people. The development of the characters and their ideals is never forced or unnatural, and there is a layer of nuance to their characteristics that many don\u2019t see. Some people think Madoka is a bland goody-two-shoes crybaby, but that\u2019s far from the truth. Madoka is a pure, sweet girl with low self-esteem, who is thrown into a situation that brings nothing but misfortune to herself and the people she cares about most. If you think she\u2019s a coward because she cries so much, you clearly aren\u2019t paying attention to what this poor girl is going through. The change in Homura from a mysterious anti-hero to a broken-hearted time traveller is interesting at the beginning, but by the end, you realise that she was the hero all along, as well as the girl she loves. Sayaka\u2019s downfall is painful in the best way possible, and, in my opinion, the most tragic character arc in the show, though she has competition. Seeing her smiling and laughing at the start when you\u2019re rewatching is equally difficult. Ky\u014dko was my favorite character the first time through, and I still love her. I ship her and Sayaka so hard, but not in the lewd fanfiction way - their relationship and their song (more on that later) is that of two people who are meant to be, but not allowed to by fate. Mami is a favorite of some people, though she isn\u2019t in the show long, and I never adored her but still respect the dimension she has even being alive for three episodes. Madoka never forgot her, and the memory of Mami lives on in the hearts of the characters. Kyuubey is a complicated villain in that he actually has a damn good point. He doesn\u2019t die or have his plans defeated - a sort of compromise is made. I could argue Kyuubey\u2019s side of the story and have plenty of evidence to support it. That genuinely complicated morality is quite thought-provoking. I adore some of this show\u2019s characters, but they\u2019re all great.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Music - 10\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is gorgeous. Even the regular style of the series is unique in its ironically explicit moe nature. The action is great when it comes around, too. But the real star of the show is the witch labyrinths. They are nothing short of trippily beautiful, if rather disturbing at times. The soundtrack is my favorite of any anime that I\u2019ve seen thus far, and I\u2019ve heard good ones. Yuki Kajiura perfectly captures the emotion of what\u2019s happening with stunning grace. Decretum nearly brings me to tears, Sis Puella Magica! is an amazing main theme, Numquam Vincar, Surgam Identidem and Nux Walpurgis are epic, and Sagitta Luminis is... beyond words. The whole OST is pure gold. All hail Kajiura-sama.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nI knew all the twists before I saw the show. That didn\u2019t stop me from feeling, and crying like a little baby over the ending. If you can, go in blind, as your experience will likely be optimized. This show is spectacular and thoroughly engaging. I couldn\u2019t put it down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s impossible to explain how much this anime means to me. It may be my favorite piece of fiction ever. Puella Magi Madoka Magica hold such a special place in my heart, and is my absolute favorite anime of all time. You NEED to watch this show. This is what anime is capable of, and it would be a crime to miss it.",

            "content": "(SPOILER ALERT)\r\nIn order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost.\r\nHeard it before, right? Yes, it's the same quote from the FMAB series, in which the theme that is heavily stressed out is the fact that you must pay something to obtain another. Madoka Magica is a series that also uses a similar theme to the quote, except a little different. Let me first explain for people who have not watched the series exactly why.\r\nIn the universe of Madoka Magica, familiars such as Kyuubey have the ability to change you into a magical girl while granting your wish; all you haveto do is simply reply that you want to become one. But Kyuubey never explains at the beginning of the series that there is a cost to becoming a magical girl, and that is losing your own humanity. Kyuubey takes your soul and puts in into a soul gem, in which you are invincible, as long as your soul gem does not get damage. Kyuubey thinks of this soul transaction as a helpful bonus, because the human body by itself is incapable of battling against a witch. Yet the character cast is terrified, and some pay even more than just the loss of their humanity.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka becomes a magical girl after making a contract with Kyuubey to grant her wish, to help return Kamijou's ability to use his body to play music. But because of this miracle, Sayaka gave away both her humanity and sanity, eventually being turned into the very thing she was to fight against, a witch. Sayaka, after becoming a magical girl, was driven into insanity, because of her naive belief that her miracle would come true and everything would be happily ever after. Well, half of that was true.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica, similar to FMAB, tries to explain that nothing in this world is free, and if you got something very valuable, you were to pay something else that was valuable. Each character is to shown to have gained and lost something in this series, such as the aforementioned Sayaka, Madoka, who lost her best friend, and Sakura, who paid her life.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again Shaft Sudios tries out their unique style of animation, which I find quite fitting with the theme and dystopic story. Madoka Magica definitely gives off a different feel, like you truly are in another universe. The animation may seem lazy and simple, but in many ways it fits the series the best.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the soundtrack, Yuki Kajiura has done it again. She has created another magical OST using operas and instruments such as the flute quite often. With an amazing story and amazing soundtrack, the enjoyment of the series is amplified over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story, soundtrack, and art were amazing, and I can consider this to be one of my favorite animes out there. Shaft studios has once again, created a story with depth and multiple layers. Madoka Magica definitely does take time to understand, as you most likely need to watch it multiple times to understand each characters point of views. Don't let that title fool you, this is definitely a dystopia-type of anime.\\n",

            "content": "By now, you've seen countless reviews saying that Puella Magi Madoka Magica (PMMM) is a great show. Reviewers say that you should watch it because it's a brilliant deconstruction of the magical girl genre, or a surprisingly dark take on the genre. \r\nThat is not the only reason to watch the show.\r\nPerhaps you are like me. You heard about PMMM, and decided to do some investigating. I accidentally spoiled major plot points for myself because I was reading too much about the show. Knowing those plot twists, I had a hard time convincing myself to put the effort into watching the show. I finally did,and was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nEven knowing what was in store, the show was a thoroughly entertaining and beatiful experience. The following review hopefully outlines why PMMM is more than worth your time. I will not spoil anything in case you want to go in blind.\\n\\n\r\nStory: While the show starts like a standard magical girl show, the real meat of the story comes into play within the first few episodes. It is not a very complex story, but the themes presented and situations encountered are all at once heart-wrenching, joyous, frustrating and satisfying. The plight of the girls is immensely touching, and the sweeping conclusion is one of the best I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character designs are all unique, and very colorful. Animation is smooth, and backgrounds are beautiful. The witch labyrinths are easily some of the most haunting and interesting scenes of the whole show. Mixing traditional animation with the \"Unmoving plaid\" effect makes for a very disorienting trip.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I watched the sub, and enjoyed the performances of each voice actor. The background music fit each scene, but is not very memorable by itself. However, the music during the witch labyrinths is appropriately creepy, and coupled with the animation make for the most memorable parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each of the main girls has different reasons for becoming a magical girl, and exploring the backstories and motivations reveals a lot about each character. While each girl represents certain archtypes, they do not feel stale. Mixing common tropes with their varied backstories keeps the characters feeling fresh.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of character development achieved in only 12 episodes is amazing. Some characters change more than others, but every major character gets so much time devoted to her that you feel like you are going on their journey with them, and rooting for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A solid plot, engaging characters and beautiful art are why you should watch this show. Not just for the \"dark themes\" and \"shock value\". After a year, that shock value is lost.  What remains is a strong, well-rounded show. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR 5 words or phrases to describe PMMM\\n\\n\r\nbeautiful art, strong character development, emotional, mature, friendship is magic :)",

            "content": "I can't count how many times I have passed to watch this anime everytime I look at the top anime list. I just can't believe why on earth would a \"Magical girl theme\" have a high score? I mean look at the picture, doesn't it look like only a child would watch this or maybe some maniac who loves magical girls? Even after reading the synopsis, it hopelessly sounds like a 12 year old magical shoujo show. \r\nI still can't believe this show is Rated-17, and also have a weird genre, I think someone made a typo - but to hell with it. I'm boredso I watched episode 1 just for lulz, lets watch some childish anime since I've never seen one since I was 10. \\n\\n\r\nThis... isn't what I thought it would be. It looked like a fairy tale made by Disney, but the storyline is written by the Grimm Brothers. I can't even call this \"magical girl\", it doesn't fit the genre. The environment, the scenes, the story and the characters are way out of my expectations. I can't believe how good this show was and it tore my heart apart. In just 12 episodes it felt like I watched a 52 episode anime + OVAs. The show was not perfect but certainly not lacking, there were some irrelevant parts but they don't hurt the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development for this show is outstanding, Kyuubei was Kyuubei, while the girls showed some some growth regardless whether they matured or they became reckless. It's hard to describe the development for this show without spoiling it, this is the best part of the show; therefore, I'd leave it as it is.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this series, you get enticed by the background music from dramatic scenes to fighting scenes. The music plays with your emotion whether you want to be sad or interested. There was never a dull moment in this part, everything was synced and it fits the environment. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was amazing.. I don't even have to describe it as it would totally spoil the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI would not say I enjoyed watching this because its not a show you enjoy watching, its a show you need to be involved with. You have to be serious with it, love it and feel it because that's how its suppose to be. Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica is a title worth of a million applause.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DL: Watch it, I gave 10 for it and I rarely make reviews.",

            "content": "\"What is the wish which you would trade your soul for?\"\r\nHere we come to another anime series about magical girls. This genre usually involves girls that have to deal with their lives while having a form of supernatural power. When I first saw this anime, I had the thoughts of it being another 'Sailor Moon', but I was wrong. I have to say that Madoka Magica is a major deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Since the series, the magical girl genre has been more noticed. As I go into the review of this anime, I have to express my view that this series isa magnificent piece of work, which many will remember. Let's now go into details...\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nMadoka Magica is about a girl named Madoka Kaname living a normal life with her friends and family, but one day, her life took a dramatic twist, when she and her friend, Sayaka confronted a cat-like creature named Kyubey, who was being chased down by a girl named Homura Akemi. Kyubey then offered the girls the opportunity to wish for anything, but in exchange, to become magical girls. As this is a magical girl series, many would expect a light-hearted and passive atmosphere, but think again, Madoka Magica actually has a very dark atmosphere, as the magical girls had to face evil, such as fighting witches. Because of this, Madoka Magica has completely rewritten the magical girl genre. Even with the dark atmosphere, the story was really well-developed throughout. The first few episodes of the anime were pretty slow-pacing, but as the story progressed, it became more intense. The plot was setted out really well and this causes the audiences to be 'on the edge of their seats' for the whole time.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is being done by Shaft, the studio that also did the art for other series, such as Nisekoi and the Monogatari series. The art throughout the series suited the atmosphere really well, especially in scenes, such as when the magical girls fight the witches. It perfectly gives the impression of a dark and gloomy place and environment. The use of various colours on the characters makes them all look really unique in their own ways. The characters design were done really efficiently, which allows the audience to distinguish between the characters. The animation were very fluent in every scene, such as in the fighting scenes or passive scenes.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Madoka Magica has an amazing soundtrack, from A to Z. The thing that stands out the most in this area is the OST. There were many emotion expressed in each songs, such as happiness in the OP, 'Connect' by ClariS, or despair in one of the ED, 'Magia' by Kalafina. The songs just fit every situation in the series perfectly and intensifies our feelings.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDespite the small amount of characters in the series, this allows us to know more about each of the characters as they grow and change throughout the series. Madoka Magica does a good job of showing the audience, the past and backstories of all the characters. This helps us to evaluate the reason behind each characters' action and feelings towards certain situation. This makes each of the characters all different in their own ways.\\n\r\n10/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, Madoka Magica was a spectacular anime. The story was very well-written and developed really nicely. The art perfectly fits each scenes of the series. The music was impressive in every bit and the characters were really memorable.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nStory: Excellent in every aspect (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\r\nArt: Nice-looking and intriguing to look at (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\r\nSound: Suited the scenes' atmosphere efficiently (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\r\nCharacters: Well-developed and memorable (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Hooked for the whole time (10/10 Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 10/10 (Very well-done and superb)\\n",

            "content": "Lets be clear about it: This is good.\r\nIf you come here expecting Sailor Moon turn back, activate nitro and get as far away as possible. Nothing so lighthearted waits for you here.\r\nThe anime tells the story of... Nah, that would be a spoiler. Madoka, a normal highschool girl, gets introduced to a world of terrible monsters known as witches and those who fight them, magical girls (those are different... kinda... maybe... ok f@ck it, lets continue). A creature known as Kyubey offers to give her magical powers, along with fullfilling one wish, in exchange for her eternal servitude as a magical girl onwards. Along withMadoka comes Sayaka, a close friend of hers who is also offered this chance. Both Madoka and Sayaka spend a large part of the series trying to decide if they want to become magical girls, and also what their wish is. One magical girl specifically, Homura, from the start tries to convince Madoka otherwise, for unclear reasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's main focus is regret, aka the girls making decisions that later backfire 100% of the time. The sentence \"This is too cruel.\" has almost become a catchphrase for the anime, as the girls are continuously psychologically tortured and manipulated. In addition, Kyubey might not be exactly the happy little funny sidekick you'd expect in a magical girls anime. Just to clarify, this isn't an adventure anime, it's a drama. The protagonist is obviously Madoka, but equal, if not more, focus is given to Homura. Every scene is painted in the most surreal way possible, successfully creating a continuous feeling of unease that really gets to the user. But there is a reason I gave it 8 instead of 10, right?\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers warning: Lets be honest about this: Kyubey's deal is a win win situation, I would take it without a thought anyday. Hell, Kyubey doesn't even force the girls to fight, all of them fight because of personal reasons, yet they keep whining about their \"terrible fate\". Hey, here's an idea, wish for a billion dollars, get an ageless repairable body, get amazing magical powers, the ability to transform into an unstoppable monster if you ever were to become completely desperate AND THEN JUST WALK AWAY. \"K, thanks, bye, have a nice evening!\" Seriously, Kyubey's contact is a win-win situation, what's to complain about?! But I digress... A second complaint would be that the art of the anime sometimes comes out as \"forced\". While it reminds of the Monogatari series a lot when it comes to style, the chaotic scene change just doesn't come out as natural as it does in Monogatari. In addition girls faces' are way too squary, making them look unproportinally large.\\n\\n\r\nBut let me be honest, those are just water under the bridge. If you're looking for plenty of well-acted drama, surreal scenery and an interesting plot, then you have found it.",

            "content": "It's no secret that I love Magical girl anime. I love the upbeat atmosphere they tend to have. I love the characters. I love the tendency to include yuri. I love the way they're just fun to watch. \r\nThat being said sometimes an anime comes along that decides to do something different with the genre. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magika is one of those anime. It's going to be difficult to discuss it without spoilers, but I can manage. \r\nThe story surrounds a girl named Madoka. She lives a normal life until she encounters a transfer student named Akemi Homura who gives her a vague warningabout not accepting offers that seem too good to be true. She also encounters a small and very creepy looking creature named Kyubey who offers her and her friend Sayaka a simple contract, they can have any wish in exchange for becoming Magical girls and fighting against witches, supernatural beings who spread despair. He especially wants Madoka due to her vast potential. Unbeknownst to either of them they're about to embark on an adventure in which they'll learn several terrible secrets about Magical girls and the power they wield. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime deals with several complex themes that you normally wouldn't find in Magical Girl anime like corruption, temptation, sacrifice and duality. Okay, maybe you'll find the last two, but you probably won't find them this well handled. Urobuchi Gen is a very talented writer. Almost everything that comes up in this anime becomes important eventually and all the questions get answered by the end. The characters are well developed and have realistic personalities. Some of them are kind of annoying but they're annoying in a realistic way rather than an exaggerated cartoony way. I also like the way that the Magical girls get actual weapons as opposed to sparkly wands, microphones, castanets or anything like that. Yes, those are all real examples. My only complaint about the story is that, though they do eventually explain why Madoka has such vast potential, the explanation they give could just as easily apply to Homura. So why is there such a difference? This is never really explained. This is a relatively minor problem though, and it's easily canceled out by the ending. Mahou Shoujo Madoka has an amazing ending. It's easily a contender for the best ending I've ever seen, in anything. Problems are resolved, through logic, and that's all I'll say about it because I really want you all to watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly well done, but the way they do the faces for characters is kind of bland and the characters look virtually identical except for the hair and eyes. One thing that is really good about the art is the stylistic and surreal images they use for the areas surrounding witches and for the witches themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good. Yuki Aoi, Saito Chiwa, and Kitamura Eri all demonstrate a lot of range and Katou Emiri does a perfect job of sounding emotionless and artificial. The music is excellent too whether it's setting the mood or being used in a scene involving one of the minor characters playing the violin. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to give it a yuri factor of 7/10. Since Homura's motivation is really homoerotic and there are some really subtext laden scenes. To be honest, this disappointed me a little since most Magical girl anime have canonical yuri and this one with a more mature target audience kept it as subtext. I realise that it isn't a traditional Magical girl anime, but they come so close to having canonical yuri between Homura and Madoka by the end that a slightly changed line or scene would have made it official and it bothers me that they didn't take that minor step.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end there are a few problems with this anime, but there's nothing too significant. The story is well thought out and amazingly written. The characters are rich and interesting. The voice acting and music are both excellent and the graphics are decent. I give Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica a 9.3/10. I'm honestly tempted to give it a higher rating just for the amazing thematic content and ending, but its few problems are just enough to stop me from doing so. The bottom line is that you should watch this anime. Even if you normally hate magical girl anime you should check it out since it isn't at all typical of the genre and it's only twelve episodes. You know, since my review of Di Gi Charat every review has been slightly more positive. I wonder what's next? \\n\r\nKing of Fighters: Another Day... Well, that's a combo breaker.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is an interesting anime, and it surprised me. Nonetheless, it is by no means a masterpiece.\r\nThe story in this anime is extremely complex. Everything starts rather simply, but things got exponentially more complex as things went through.\r\n-------Spoiler ahead:\r\nThe story was fine until it touched the laws of the universe and thermodynamics. The principle of harnessing the energy of a witch conversion to nullify the universe's entropy is way too far fetched. \r\nThe time travel aspect of this anime was good, but nothing exceptional. It certainly improved the story.\r\nFurthermore, the concept of witches and grief seeds was not very good in my opinion.For instance, familiars are spared so that they collect human energy, to become a witch, and only then be killed by a magic girl so that they can collect the grief seed and get the witches energy, which essentially is indirectly absorbing human energy.\\n\r\nSo pointless. Why not make it so that magic girls, if they wish so, can directly kill humans to get stronger? I think evil magic girls could be explored more and replace witches.\\n\r\nKyubey being evil, or perhaps simply neutral, was a plus to the story.\\n\r\nBecause of these issues, and the over the top ending, I can not give this anime a high rating for the otherwise good story.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was hit or miss. I particularly did not enjoy the way witches and their barriers were made. In general, the art was mediocre. It delivered its purpose, but just that.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the music of the anime, and overall the sound quality and effects were good and fitted the anime well.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was the main theme of this anime. The plot mainly served as a way to display the characters feelings, rather being the focus itself.\\n\r\nAs such, we got to know all the characters deeply and know their personal struggles. That said, it became a bit repetitive, and in no way was it a masterpiece. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was initially dull to me, but then, it got overtly complex trying to achieve depth. It got me going in conjunction with the characters, but it was not a particularly memorable experience to me. The enjoyment was mediocre.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime certainly pleased the fans of the genre. But to an outsider, it just provided a fair experience. The plot certainly is the most interesting aspect of the anime. I am sure some will think of it as a masterpiece. But to me, complexity is not necessarily quality, so this anime can not have masterpiece status to me.\\n\r\n6/10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Take it easy please, my first review :)\r\nIn my time watching anime, I have always spent my time watching the cliche shows such as Naruto, One Piece etc. It was only recently that I had been introduced to the many deep and meaningful anime that have been out of my sight for such a long time, and Madoka Magica was one of them.\r\nOverall, the plot of the story was very well choreographer, the events taking place in the anime, as they are unveiled seem absolutely unbelievable. The scheme of things seem devious but also mistifying at the same time, and all do a very goodjob at causing the viewer to FEEL something. Yes this anime actually makes you go through emotional agony, really making you question matters like what it really means to be a human, religion, emotion, society. All are tied together and represented in a masterful and action filled heartbreaking anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story was very well done, wasn't rushed at all and was so unique but at the same time flexible, that it allowed the writers to really be able to portray the characters very well and show how they are developing through the dilemma they are in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters develop wonderfully, turning from happy to sad to insane in a steady and organized manner, everything has a reason for happening, which gives a great bit of satisfaction when you see something happen to a character and understand it fully and be able to connect to it feel bad or good about the character.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music was amazing. I felt that it did lack something, which I cant really put my hands on, but im still going to give it a 10/10 because it fit with the overall feel of the anime and made each seen either really intense or sad and did a very good job at it. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Shaft really did a spectacular job with this one, animation is very pretty and always top notch, they even went to the trouble of trying to make every seen or a quick still look really really epic, even if its just showing streetlights, or a dark room with only a single light, the lights arnt exaggerated Battlefield 3 style, but are still done so well that it makes all the stills stand out. The set pieces were also impressive and did a great job and showing off that Shaft had a lot of money to spare.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the anime especially because of the meaningful messages it brought up, and the many connections to religion that it made, tying it all this together was really magnificent and im just a sucker for this kind of stuff. I really enjoyed the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Its a great anime stressing many aspects of human nature and evil and portraying amazing set pieces and storytelling and pacing. Lovely characters and amazing art. This kind of anime is very rare and it should not be missed.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is a show that disguised itself as a typical magical girl series but ended up as a deconstruction of the genre, doing a whole 360\u00b0 and transforming an apparently innocent show into a dark fantasy series.\r\nThe story of Madoka Magica started up as a regular Magical Girl series, our young protagonist Madoka meets the \"adorable\" and \"cute\" magical creature Kyubey who  \r\noffers her to fulfill one wish, whatever it could be, and, in exchange, she would have to start being a magical girl.\r\nSo for the first two episodes they carry out this \"normal\" mahou shoujo plot as any other showof the same genre would, we see the magical girls fighting with their natural enemies, \"The Witches\" and the characters interact with each other as any other teenager would. But this is only the quiet before the storm.\\n\r\nIn episode three the show turns itself upside down and becomes a dark fantasy, and we see the characters trying to unravel the horrible truth behind the witches, the magical girls and their inescapable reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe director of this series was Akiyuki Shinbou who also directed Hidamari Sketch a moe looking show. As such the artwork in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is also kind of moe which was part of the reason why nobody would have guessed that it would become such a dark series and thought that this would be only a straightforward and light-hearted show.\\n\r\nHowever when things get crazy and people start dying, getting suicide and going insane, the moe looking artwork makes a high contrast and makes everything even more disturbing.\\n\r\nThe design of the main enemies the \"Witches\" is also used to make a contrast as they have a rather cartoonish look that make them seem harmless while, in reality, they are lethal monsters.\\n\r\nThe animation itself is fluid and consistent and it looks even more amazing in the battle scenes that is when it truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack can be described in one word and that particular word would be \"EPIC\", the reason behind this is only one and that is because Yuki Kajiura is its composer.\\n\r\nThe fact that Mrs. Kajiura composed the soundtrack of this series was kind of a clue about the show\u00b4s real nature, as she is usually involved in series with dark tones such as Fate/Zero and Kara no Kyoukai. But when this soundtrack really shines is in the battle scenes, where we can hear the orchestra with the vocal choirs in the background, and I\u00b4m a sucker for those.\\n\r\nAs for the openings and endings, the opening was \"Connect\" by ClariS and it was  \\n\r\na very nice song, granted, but it sounded kinda like it was made for a completely\\n\r\ndifferent show and, as the series went forward, this opening ended up being less and less fitting for the show, but it was very catchy so that\u00b4s really my only complain about it.\\n\r\nThe ending theme, however, it\u00b4s a completely different story because it fit the show perfectly, the ending theme is \"Magia\" by Kalafina and the ending became unskippable for me just because of that song, it\u00b4s simply awesome.\\n\r\nIn regards of the voice acting it was pretty solid I really have no complains about it and Chiwa Saito did an amazing job as Homura because she managed to give feelings to a character that, at first, apparently had none.\\n\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode series, this show has some heavy development for every one of it\u00b4s characters and by the end you will probably be attached to most of them which will only make the trauma worst when you see them dying RIGHT in front of your eyes in the most dramatic and sad way possible.\\n\r\nThe weakest character in this series is probably it\u00b4s protagonist, Madoka, because she is very indecisive on whether being a magical girl or not because even if there isn\u00b4t something she wants so much that she would risk her life for, she feels the need to help people and to help other magical girls in their fight, so there is a kind of dilemma, but when I thought about it I asked myself \"If I had seen the kind of sh*t this girl has seen, would I have done something different?\", and the answer to that is NO because everyone would be scared if someone told them to risk their life like that even if by doing so they can have a wish granted. So even if she is indecisive she has a very good justification for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series ended great and it had the two things I love the the most in any kind of medium: a dark story and a fantasy setting, plus it looks and sounds incredible. How could I not like this show?\\n\\n\r\nSo, people, do not be fooled by appearances because this is NOT your typical Mahou Shoujo, so if you are looking for great character development, a story with A LOT of plot twist (plus sad and traumatic events) and an awesome ending to the series, you owe it to yourself to watch this series.\\n\r\nFor me this series was a 9.4/10 but I can\u00b4t use decimals on MAL so it ended up with a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSo I will see you on my next review I hope. I bid you farewell",

            "content": "To say I am truly stunned and floored by this series isn't doing it any justice. I have never watched a magical girl series before this (I even made it a point to boycott Sailor Moon for good, because I couldn't stand how dry it was after watching a handful of episodes). However, this series' plot progression, style, and everything else about it stand to justify my watching it.\r\nLet's clear up one major detail: I am male. At the time of writing this, I am 19 and in college, and I am a huge fan of heavy metal music. I am one of the mosttestosterone-driven people I know. How this magical girl anime - which crosses over to borderline psychological horror at points - consistently drives me to emotional depths I never even knew I had is truly amazing. The range of emotion displayed throughout is downright amazing. Not since Hayao Miyazaki have I seen such brilliance from character development, and not since Ennio Morricone have I felt so swayed by the score of anything. The soundtrack is perfectly placed, deep and dark, with Kalafina's vocals reaching a whole new level of haunting. I sometimes find myself getting goosebumps by how well the sound is done. That's not easy to do for someone like me.\\n\\n\r\nI am very, VERY enthusiastic about the story. Few interpretations of true self-sacrifice and true, heartfelt emotion are made today, and even fewer are made in America. This is one \"Mahou Shoujo\" series that delivers. A lot of series are very easily distracted by the \"magical girl\" aspect and not easily brought into the plot, but the fact of the matter is, the plot is incredibly well-illustrated and there is never a dull moment. Again, not since a true classic has something like this been brought to light.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is definitely different from anything I've previously seen. Madoka's eyes are given very meticulous yet minimalistic direction. I can't call it \"effortless,\" but it comes together magnificently. Akiyuki Shinbo brings a hint of Shel Silverstein-influenced LSD into the mix, and we get a genuinely horrifying witch's labyrinth. You start to become entwined in the plot right alongside the other characters, so to speak, understanding their gravity of emotion and genuine fear. This only gets amplified in Episode 3. It's a whole different breed of enjoyment, like the kind of addiction you get to reading a classic horror novel, but scaled up to a much more widespread audience.\\n\\n\r\nSuffice to say, however, it's not for the faint of heart. If you like most other magical girl series, you probably should watch this as an experiment, but I can't recommend it to everyone. There are subtle nuances in the plot that leave you puzzled and dissatisfied at times, even though they have (so far) mostly been resolved. You can't be impatient with a series like this. It's the delicate balance of everything that's presented before you that makes Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (also known as Puella Magi Madoka Magica) such an amazing series. \\n\\n\r\nUntil an official sub is released, I'd stick with gg's fansub. It's pretty accurate and easy to read because of the high contrast, and it doesn't take away from the energy of the anime. It's dark, well-paced, well-versed, and breathtakingly beautiful at every turn. I can only hope the next two episodes are as good.",

            "content": "So, Mahou Shoujo animes are for little girls right? Hmm. How to put it. Neil Patrick Harris is gay by formality and title, but in actuality, he is probably one of the most awesome person to walk this Earth. Madoka Magica is pretty...gay.. by title, but in actuality it is probably one of the most awesome anime to have been aired. \r\nSTORY: Complete troll on the producer's part, this was actually advertised as a slice of life show....it's not....The show starts off with a normal school girl going to school (obviously) and having cute and moe fun with her friends, and by all means, thefirst two episodes can be categorized as a slice of life. But...when it hits the third episode...it basically makes you want to play Russian roulette with 6 bullets, crap your pants with rainbows, throw up your dinner, give you a lust for unicorn tears, while crying blood and eating your socks. Yes. Quite a mess of emotions to say the least. I will not say anything about the plot in detail from here because everything and anything will be a massive spoiler, but just be warned that you will be absolutely sh!t-faced after watching this show. It triggers painful emotions, with this extremely dark and depressing yet heartwarming story. The tags are there for a reason. The story wastes no time at all and in just 12 episodes it creates one of the most memorable story in your anime watching history. It revolves around hatred, jealousy, greed and everything in between, but mainly friendship and, in my opinion more importantly, loneliness and despair and overcoming odds. I honestly cannot say anymore without spoiling anything, but trust me, psychological and horror in my opinion are the biggest categories i would put this show under.\\n\\n\r\nART: Now this one is also very troll-y. The characters are so damn moe its almost disgusting at what they have to go through in these 12 episodes. The animation is veeery unique with its moe style with a few cg effects, and a world that gives a vibe of being sketched with colored pencil. Its very pleasing. The quality therefore is top notch as to how it is pulled off. I've never watched a mahou shoujo, but battling is a part of them i'm pretty sure. And the battles, to be honest, (at least in this show) is very well dished out, and i can safely compare them to the scenes of typical, no, top-notch shounen animes. The only thing is...the style of the battles...i cannot explain it but, the battles give the vibe that the artists were very high on various drugs while creating the show (you can decide for yourself if i'm joking or not). But yes, it is in the end, a very unique art style that sticks with you at how ironic the cuteness is compared to story of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: To be honest, its not memorable and its not the best, but instead, its unique (as in on drugs unique) to match with the rather different art style. I can say that the sound is perfect for the show at how it blends in with the scenes. But there are one or two OSTs that are gut wrenchingly messed up at how much emotion it puts you through.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is heavily character driven, and is focused on the hardships the character have to overcome (...do they overcome them?...watch and find out :D ) Like i said, the main focus of the story is the power of friendship, what loneliness will do to a person and what despair and pressure will make a person do. It also deals with the concept of \"Be careful of what you wish for\" because what you get in return may not be what you want, or there are unexpected and horrible consequences. Every character....grows..? Yes, they do, however, growing isn't always positive, as someone can grow and mature in the wrong direction and Madoka Magica deals with this idea VERY. THOROUGHLY. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: The first two episodes are slow and to be honest you might be thinking why the hell am i watching this, but, this is necessary to set up the plot and themes. These two episodes are a waste, but that is exactly why this shows needs it. And then comes the infamous THIRD EPISODE. You will be very surprised in both a good and bad way at the way the show goes about. Episode 4-10 will make you want more and more after each consecutive episode as the story gets deeper and darker, but at the same time, somewhat brighter. In the final two episodes, i must say, it is, out of all the animes i have watched ( i have watched much more than i have on my MAL list, just too lazy to post them up), i experienced some of the most powerful emotional rollercoasters. The conclusion is epic and you will not regret watching it. I suggest that you do not finish this in one sitting, however tempting it may be, otherwise your brain will turn into a mushy grey matter like mine and leak out of your ear because of the beating it took. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Amazing. This was my first mahou shoujo and it was recommended to me by a friend who told me how it will be the most f***ed up thing i will ever watch. It was pretty close, i think School Days still wins in this situation :P though. The morals that are presented are so good (i won't write them because they may be a bit spoilery) and the way the characters deal with them are both heartwarming and spirit breaking.  Nothing is perfect though, and the one \"flaw\" i would say is that, this is, in essence, a mahou shoujo, and it does get a bit sappy and girly, but that is the show, and i would like to think that it adds to the show. But it is in no way a true hinderence to the show. \\n\\n\r\nIs this a watch? Um, do you like anime? Yes you should f***ing watch it why are you even still reading this review?",

            "content": "With a show this complex and groundbreaking, a review in and of itself won't be able to cover all the factors that resulted in me giving it a perfect score. Nonetheless, I'll try my best to give a brief idea on why I felt Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica was a masterpiece. \r\nArt (10/10)\r\nNot even a minute into the first episode, the artwork intrigued me; not because it was necessarily outstanding, but because it was unique. For me, it was the first time that I have seen this type of art style being used in anime. After getting used to it, I noticed that it blended inreally well with the typical anime art that we are all used to. The flawless combination of these two art styles to create interesting visuals really impressed me. In the past, and even now, I haven't been a big fan of art, let alone abstract art, but after watching this series, my interest has grown slightly. In my point of view, I think this aspect of the series was either a hit or miss, with the totally different styles either enhancing or degrading the audience's experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\r\nThe most interesting character, in my opinion, has got to be Kyuubey. The emotionless face he has while telepathically spewing deceptive and persuasive words makes for a character that leaves many viewers unsure of whether to love or hate. As for the girls themselves, they are a great example of what can happen to a person when he/she is given the chance to obtain an immense amount of power. I find the Soul Gems a great representation of this. The more one uses their newfound power for themselves, the more evil will spread within them. But using one's powers for good, something that happens less often, will allow one to purify themselves (in a mental sense, that is). Throughout the series, the psychological stress of being a magical girl evidently changes the personalities of each character. These changes may be drastic but are surprisingly quite realistic and believable. Like in many of my other reviews a cast of characters with different personalities is always a plus in my books. What's special here is that the outfit of these girls after they \"transform\" also reflects their personality. Aside from the excellent story, I believe that the characters, especially Kyuubey, contributed immensely towards the success of this series. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe first ClariS song I listened to was 'irony', OP for Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai. Ever since then, I've become a fan of their songs. 'Connect', the OP for Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, was no exception. It was never a mood killer in any way and, in fact, set up the episode quite well in close to all the episodes. As for 'Magia', the ED, it wasn't really my cup of tea but I have to say that it was the perfect song to end off the episodes. A sense of despair and suspense amplified the often depressing and cliffhanger ends of the episodes. BGM was appropriate and fit in well. The cast of highly-talented voice actresses added to my enjoyment. Their portrayal of the characters' emotions were done especially well, sometimes making the 'acting' part of their job seem obsolete. If I were to pick the weakest aspect in this category, it would have to be the BGM. Although this is the case, I'm certainly not saying it's bad, but it just doesn't compare to the superior quality of the other aspects (OP, ED, VAs). \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\r\nThe toughest section to write about is definitely the story. I find it hard to string together a short paragraph that, without spoiling anything, describes this story well - one that, I believe, has revolutionized the \"mahou shoujo\" genre. In my opinion, Episodes 3, 8, 10 and 12 were the pinnacles of this excellent story; the great use of plot twists and the tying up of loose ends to keep the viewer interested and not confused, respectively. All in all, the story in Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is the reason for its success and trying to summarize it would never work; it would probably create some false hope/expectations instead. So all I can say now is: just watch it and you'll see why so many people, including me, say it's so good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nWhat more can I say? A perfect score in all the previous categories should be enough to convince you to give this anime a try. Whether you're an avid \"mahou shoujo\" fan or have no idea what it is, there's a high chance that watching Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica will change your perspective on the genre; I know that it did for me. What's best about the series is the fact that it doesn't spoonfeed every little detail to its audience and, instead, forces them to think a bit in order to understand what's going on. So, once again, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is definitely an anime to try. I'm almost certain that you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "The production quality is top notch... but the show has some very serious issues with theme.  If you want a fun visual romp then this is a great show, if you're hoping for something deeper you will end up disappointed.\r\nIt's very difficult to discuss it without spoiling, but basically my issue is that the show is dark, very dark.  But there's no actual exploration of why the world is dark other than to create an opposition to the show's art style & young characters.  \r\nThe principle of karma (that kindness and malevolence must be generated in equal amounts) makes very little senseand is just a fixed mechanic in the world.  There's no reason why it has to be that way, and there's not exploration into why there has to be a karmic balance, and the story muddles itself in trying to seem deep while not actually exploring human nature or anything that would be needed to talk about it on a next level.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Whenever we pray for somebody's happiness, someone else must be cursed in exchanged.\" - Sayaka Miki\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (Madoka Magica for short), is a psychological thriller, drama, and magic genre that made it's debut in early January of 2011. Since the time of it's release, the show has received a lot of praise and high scoring reviews over how much this show changed the magical girl subgenre. Madoka Magica is not your typical lighthearted magic anime, it delivers a deep and more darker message and portrays situations that the character's are in maturely to it's audience. With such a show that's cause widespread criticalacclaim, is it worth the hype it deserves? Let's find out. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I think of the phrase \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" now, Madoka Magica is the first thing that pops into my head. Gen Urobuchi wants you to be fooled by the cute and lighthearted image, opening theme, and first 2 episodes. In truth, this is a much more darker and deeper story than any other magical girl genre has ever produced.\\n\\n\r\nIn its first two episodes of Madoka Magica, two cute and young girls, Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki, run into a cat-like magical creature named Kyuubey in a shopping mall. Kyuubey then offers them a contract: he will grant any wish they desire. In exchange however, they will gain 'magical girl powers' and fight witches, who are natural and phenomenon forces of evil of unknown origin. After the first 2 episodes and end of episode 3, Madoka Magica evolves from an lighthearted story to a much more dramatic plot that explores the girls' relationships, despairs, and the price they must pay for fulfilling their wishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe main overall themes the anime explores, the build and set-up on the cold and dark truth of the Magical Girls, the sinister tone and dark themes it uses to portray the audiences interest and keep the show from dragging on, the immersive plot and overall picture makes Madoka Magica's story very unique, interesting, easy to follow, and enjoyable to a more mature audience who appreciates these kinds of themes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork done in Madoka Magica is very well done in doing both the lighthearted aspects of the film (character models, magical girls outfits, Kyuubey, etc), as well as the dark themes and sinister witch designs. The scenery and futuristic artwork of the school Madoka attends, the skyscrapers, landscapes, and environment surrounding the show is done in a very well mannered way. The character models, while first looking at them, may not be as attractive as to the design 6 years later, still holds up nicely if you take the time to get used to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork done with the witches and their dimensions, or labyrinths, is really what sticks out. The concept is very unique in making the witches and surrounding areas stick out from most of the current artwork in the film outside the labyrinths. They looked mysterious, Coraline like, which I really appreciated a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the artwork is definitely not for everyone. Some may find the character models to look funny and or goofy, and some might not be a fan of how the witches and their labyrinths are designed. Personally, I enjoyed it a lot and it holds up the dark tone the show gives at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Madoka Magica is outstanding and shines the brightest in the mood the show wants you to feel and interact with. The opening theme for the show is one of my all time favorites, the singing and music in it is very well choreographed. Once again, it tricks the viewers who are watching to think of the show as a cute lighthearted series, when it's in fact the exact opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe end theme after the third episode is probably the best soundtrack that comes into play. Kalafina's track 'Magia' sets the atmosphere as being a creepy and dark track to invoke the audiences shock of the drastic change the show undergoes. I found myself humming to both the opening and ending themes a lot and still am as I write this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the sounds, music, OSTs, and opening/ending themes are a masterpiece that really helps set the score high for Madoka Magica. I enjoyed every minute of the music and never skipped the opening and ending themes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest drive and success that I found while watching Madoka Magica was how the characters really stuck out and all felt important in the show. The characters throughout the show go through very meaningful and enjoyable character development, especially with Madoka Kaname and Homura Akemi, the girl Madoka was dreaming about in the first scene of the show. I felt an emotional attachment and deeper understanding for the character's motives, goals, and feelings throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Kaname sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, always doubting herself and what she's capable of. After seeing Mami Tomoe, another Magical girl who she befriends, fighting against witches, she now wants to be a wonderful and cool Puella Magi like her. Madoka always cares about others and puts them first before herself. A very lovable main protagonist who people can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nHomura Akemi is my favorite character in the show. She's a mysterious girl that Madoka dreamt of in the first episode. After transferring to Madoka's school, he seems to know Madoka well and has a constant goal to prevent her from becoming a magical girl. Her motives are unclear in the beginning, but as the show progresses, you learn the truth about Homura and why she has such a big and important role in Madoka Magica. She's also, in my opinion, one of the rare well done Kuundere girls out there.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters: Sayaka Miki, Mami Tomoe, Kyouko Sakura, and Kyuudey, all play a very critical and important role in Madoka's life and the overall story. Each having their own motives and agendas. The cast is short, but has a big impact on the viewer, as the show constantly has character development happening in each episode. The characters are what drove the show in the right direction with a strong story-line to follow. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy initial take on Madoka Magica was very different from how I feel now about the show. I was one of the many fooled ones who thought this show would be lighthearted and cute. Boy, I was in for an amazing experience. Almost every single aspect of the show stood out and made an impact on how I felt after each episode was concluded. I loved the themes Madoka Magica used to portray the plot and suspense, I loved (to a certain degree) the art design and aspects of how the witches were designed, the sound and characters were flawless and easily a perfect score for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2/10 (9)\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is one of my many gems that I'm glad I took a chance on and watched. It's definitely left an impact on me and I truly found everything to be better than average. You can forget about any kind of fan service, stupid story plot-holes, bland characters, and being bored. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing I would criticize about the show, is how some of the supporting characters didn't have too big of an impact with how the show played, as well as some of the design choices with the artwork in certain aspects. These unfortunately stop me from giving it a 10/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nIf Madoka Magica taught me one thing, it's how a wish you make can really impact someones and your own life, for better or for worse. I enjoyed this anime a lot and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan with a darker, yet lovable approach to shows like Madoka Magica.",

            "content": "All I have to say is, don't be fooled by the cover art and description of this anime... I would rank this as one of the most serious/deep psychological anime I've ever seen. If you are looking for something that is more than meets the eye, this anime is perfect for you.\r\nStory:  10/10 \r\nThe story was insane. It blows my mind how they were able to fit all that into just twelve episodes of anime. I must reiterate, the episodes are NOT LIGHT. If you are looking to laugh or enjoy some banter between characters, THIS ANIME IS NOT THAT. I found myself pausingand trying to figure out things quite often as I went through it, and I believe without stopping to understand the anime, it is difficult to appreciate how masterful the story is at the end of the day.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it so good? Simply how sudden the plot twists at around the 9th/10th episode. Everything that happens in episodes 1-8 foreshadows and sets up the big twist, which makes the ending THAT much more powerful. It all gathers up, every detail, to make the ending great. This is why I rate the story so highly- everything had its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA very unique art style, one that I've never seen before. I didn't find it bothersome as some people did, instead I did like how simplistic it was. A nice break from the often times complicated art styles of other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nCatchy OP and ED, sound in fights/dramatic moments were fitting. Nothing stood out but nothing bad either, so not much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 9/10 (minor spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nMy god the characters.. Let me just say the only thing keeping this from a 10 was probably the lack of development for characters like Mami, or the lack of more background for Kyubbey. Other than that, I saw no problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really make this anime. The personalities of the characters are emphasized in the plot, for instance the caring personality of Madoka eventually shapes her eternal fate in the ending. Even though Homura thought it was a sad existence for her being trapped eternally, the fact that Madoka loves to help people and cares about everyone, makes it so that its the perfect job for her. I thought that was really neat.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the characters are all believable, all of them kind of embodying a person who we at one point of our lives, probably were. For instance, Madoka embodies the \"good girl/boy\" that we might've been in our youth. Never told a lie, never done a bad thing, and essentially, as pure as it gets. Sayaka is kind of the ambitious, hotheaded, rush into it all kind of personality. And Homura is the opposite of Madoka, the one who knows everything that has happened and is in a way scarred by it all. I thought it was cool how the characters represented a progression of life that we all in some way go through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really impressed me in that it was short, but packed with action and meaning. I would recommend this anime, especially if you enjoyed something like Steins;Gate. I found myself doubtful of the good reviews at first, but I would say to keep watching as it only gets better!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Now I hated Sailor Moon. And I HATED Tokyo Mew Mew. I was just not a fan of the whole magical girl thing. It was boring, corny, and the powers were usually not that great. Needless to say, when Madoka Magica aired, I almost didn't watch. And after the first couple episodes, I almost dropped it. It's a good thing I did because if I did, I would have dropped a fantastic series.\r\nIf you were asked to sell your soul as a magical girl in exchange for one wish, how long would it take to answer? What wishes would you debate in your head? Wouldit be worth it? Just that alone is a dramatic scenario, and it peeked my interest, but only slightly since it seemed to me like it might end up like another mahou shoujo anime. However, three episodes in to Madoka Magica  I'm basically smacked across the face with something I didn't expect (you'll know when you see it). Basically, the girly giggly anime is nowhere to be found. Instead, a first class action drama is in its place. The story goes deeper than many anime I've see, and who would've thought that it would come out of an anime that looks like a kid's cartoon. A dark atmosphere combined with a top-notch scenario, however, couldn't be further than childlike.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite unique compared to other series of the genre. When the characters are fighting witches, the art is both impressive and disturbing, yet simple in its concept. That kind of art has been seen before such as in Tsumiki no Ie, but not in such a way that involves fast-paced action. The character designs are quite simple, but are effective none the less. However, this is not neccessarily an eye-candy series, so don't go into hoping for visuals that blow your mind. If that's the case, look elsewhere. Otherwise, expect above average visuals but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack floored me. Within the first minute, an insert (which also becomes the ED) sucks you into the action. In contrast, the OP conveys and innocence, and yet a sadness that matches the show perfectly. Also, the seemingly Celtic/Sacred feel of the BGMs is something the likes of which I've never heard before, and am impressed still. The soundtrack for this series is easily in my top five I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite believable given the circumstances. Not only that, but when it all comes down to it, a human is a human. When something happens that affects them all, they all feel the same. Showing it, maybe not. But feeling it yes, and Madoka Magica shows this nicely. When faced with a decision that can change your life, how will you act? If you have trouble figuring that out, think about the characters of Madoka Magica. In half-assed anime, their decisions would be immediate with no emotion, but in this case, it is how it would be in real life, which is impressive. Madoka takes a cautious and somewhat cowardly approach. Homura takes a more friendly approach by accepting to be accepted. Sayaka takes a selfish approach by doing it for someone she loves. Mami takes a desperate approach because declining would result in death. And Kyouko takes the more thoughtful approach and accepts in order to better her dads career. Different people, different reasons, different outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica will be an anime that will remain with me for a while. Compared to anime from the present, it is among my top 10. I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who watches anime for a deep and dramatic experience, and I promise you will receive it.",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka\u2605Magica Review \r\nThere are no spoilers in this review \r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica was an interesting anime to watch, it was a type of anime I avoid normally. That being focused on Magical Girls. I have to say this was quite a shock on what I expected. But it wasn't anything too drastic. I found myself confused at the end on exactly what I felt about the show. \r\nI do have to say early on much of it was spoiled for me so when certain scenes came on they didn't have the same effect, which means for a good portion of it Iwas bored watching it. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThe story was interesting. It started out slow and was difficult to pay attention. I found myself enjoying the first 3 episodes better before the show turned into the depressive state of a teenage girl. This wasn't particularly bad to view, but wasn't that interesting and I've seen similar happen plenty of times before; Neon Genesis Evangelion anyone? \\n\r\nThe show really picked up at episode 8 and so the ending played out well in my books. The most important aspect, the story was enough for me to boost up my score as it did improve my enjoyment of the series. \\n\r\nThis show was quite good for a show about selling your soul to the devil. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nWell this was the area which this show struggled the most. The artstyle was poor for most of it, with some pretty shocking style for the characters design. The witch fight sequences where interesting with the art direction, but those gave me the unofficial title which I had been referring to the anime; being \"The dangers of Gas leaks, the anime\". \\n\r\nI have no real complaints about the background art, the designs of the characters, the prop art, music and sound. I did watch the english dub so the voice acting wasn't that good, but it wasn't that distracting from the story. I did cringe a little however. \\n\r\nThe opening sequence really didn't suit the show well but the song was good; the credit sequence really suited the feeling of ths show well and I really liked that song and I listen to it often. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThe characterisation of this show is the strongest point. The designs where all good and the personalities the characters had were well emulated. I didn't really find myself liking any character particularly more than the others however. I think I did like Mami more then the others, but not that much. \\n\r\nI did think that they perhaps focused a bit to much on Sayaka for a while and her relationship with Kyousuke, which did steal away from who should have been the main focus, being Madoka. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nOverall I'm happy with how this show turned out. I enjoyed it and the only real negatives are from a bit of nitpicking. I was surprised how much I liked it in the end even though the ending was a bit lame. I think it earned the score which I'm giving it of 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10",

            "content": "Have you ever watched a movie so intense that you felt the irresistible urge to tell someone, anyone, about it because how it made you feel? Has a piece of media ever resonated with you so strongly that you were left speechless and felt empty? When was the last time that a work of art made you more closely examine the world around you? I ask these questions because these are the sorts of emotions and thoughts that ran through my head as the credits rolled on episode 12 of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\r\nMany anime are tearjerkers, many anime make you feel empowered, and manyanime deliver satisfaction through feelgood stories. Madoka could be considered all of those things, but more than any of those other feelings I just felt awestruck. I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed or how a show whose main characters are middle school magical girls had just forced me to stop and consider serious philosophical questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe above is all I can tell you about the content of the story. Even the slightest bit more specific would be massive spoilers. All I can say is you MUST give this show a few episodes. Don't judge it based on the first episode or two alone.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the story, the characters are perfectly written. No character is unnecessary. No character feels flat. All major characters have some sort of arc that is intricately and purposefully woven into the plot for a specific purpose. Empathizing with all of our magical heroes was very easy for me.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as execution, this is studio SHAFT to a T: striking visuals, surrealist styling, and an amazing use of imagery to convey tone, theme, and emotion. In the TV version some early art feels a bit rushed or lacking a budget, but SHAFT always cleans up the art for the BD release, so if you're watching that you shouldn't notice any of those problems. It feels like the art only gets better as the show goes on too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I watched the Japanese dub with English subtitles and the voice acting is strong and all of the characters feel unique and well acted. I didn't notice any errors, so there were none so egregious as to pull me out of the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is composed by Kajiura Yuki and it is simply amazing. The BGM is so hauntingly beautiful it stayed in my mind for hours after I had finished the series. Her ability to create exactly the right tone to convey the message of every scene left me breathless. In particular the track titled \"Credens Justidiam\" is so amazing that I can't stop listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThere's too much to say about this show in a review. The themes explored, the powerful nature of the work, and the brilliant execution deserve much, much more analysis and praise than I could possibly express here. My only goal in writing this is to convince you that you MUST go watch it. I hope I have succeeded.",

            "content": "What to say about Madoka Magika. Well First off This anime is one that will throw you for a loop one that its hard to forsee what is going to happen next. For a very long time this anime was at the top for me and its still my #2. to anyone that wants a serious in depth story for a short anime this one will take the cake. It will make you fall in love with characters along with hating them aswell it will also make you realize that you need to live your life and it shows that in a beautiful way. Thisanime will also show you that friends are important and without them you are lost. This is also some of the best Dubbing for anime ive seen and i dont like alot if dub anime but this one is very well done in my opinion. To people that think this is a girly magical girl anime you will be thrown for a loop when you see how dark it truly is. I will highly reccomend this to anime watchers. If you agree disagree or even wanna discuss the anime visit my profile and let me know.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSincerely, The Anime Gods",

            "content": "One in a while one would stumble upon a surprisingly subversive and interesting series that defies its roots. As such is the case of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. What makes this series interesting is it offers a unique deconstructive take on the magical girl genre.\r\nWhile the core concept of the show's story has been done before (grim, depressing magical girl show) the story still manages to leave its own mark by copying distinct elements and criticizing said elements by showing the realistic grim consequences. This type of genre deconstruction shows that the makers are very familiar with the conventions and how to subvert them. Grantedthere are some moments that could've been sped up a bit and the final moments seem confusing in a Gainax-esque manner. Fortunately, everything is held together by the reoccurring themes of selflessness and faustian motifs. These elements help prevent the story from buckling in on itself even with the occasionally uneven scenes and mind-bendingly surreal moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are all well-written and likable. What really makes the characters work surprisingly well is how some of the narrative offers deconstructive takes on their archetypical traits. For example, Homura is considered what TV Tropes describes as a \"Satellite Character\" whose life revolves only around one character, in her case Madoka. However, Homura's archetype is deconstructed as her clingly protective nature of Madoka shows how empty her life was before and how her obsession has worn her out at times. Interestingly Madoka herself is treated as helpless bystander yet she has her own engaging self-contained character arc of trying to find purpose. Overall these characters work because of how the story fleshes them out using basic character archetype traits. Plus everyone sound legitimately shocked at deaths thanks to the fact that the voice actors were deliberately mislead.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is obviously fantastic (this is a Studio Shaft work afterall), what really makes the animation style work is how it intelligently it mixes different styles and images. The girls are drawn in a soft pastel moe while the the witches resemble dark cutouts and the disaster scenes are drawn in dark watercolors straight out of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei. These mixed art styles provide a nice sense of contrast such that there is an eerie otherworldliness. Furthermore, the art direction helps with storytelling given the design of the witches. Each witch is a represent a despair-infused personification of feminine interest, thus giving insights into their origins and relationship to the characters. As such, fighting the witches would be like confronting their inner demons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Its narrative offers a unique deconstructive take on the Magical Girl genre and characters. It's an engaging experiencing of examining despair and the cruelty of world that leaves viewer cathartically relieved in the end. On a final note, I know a lot of people are unhappy with the ending and I get that. However, I'm also fine with it because it honors the recurring themes: everything has a price and true heroism means willing to give up one's happiness.",

            "content": "There are shows I rewatch to relive the magic, only to learn the magic has faded. There are times I fear the magic has faded, only for it to persist. And there are times the magic persists, and creates a miracle that improves a show. This is the show where the magic persists. This is the story where the miracle unfolds. This is the tale known as Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\r\nBut honestly, the miracle shouldn\u2019t have happened. There\u2019s no surprise to keep interest, but only inevitability in knowing what happens. And it\u2019s no secret the story is now exposed at the basic level; starting asa lighthearted fantasy before falling on a web of despair spun by its own builders. But more standout than the entire web is the strength of each thread. None of them insignificant. All of them a sight to behold.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what viewers behold in the first few minutes is our titular character Madoka, running through a vacant hallway shaped by shadows and light filling the emptiness. It\u2019s a fitting backdrop to establish what shapes the story VS what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s also one of many stylistic choices used to great effect. The witches are chaotic, their designs equally so, while a certain character\u2019s design grows steadily darker until it\u2019s only a silhouette of despair highlighted by a smile of insanity.\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes these stylistic visuals work is how they\u2019re not used to the point of ineffective. It punctuates scenes instead of the entire show, and allows normal visuals to do some heavy lifting. A veteran magical girl lectures two would-be rookies, but her own face is shadowed, creating a sense of uncertainty. A character\u2019s dependency shows early on as she blindly searches for a facetowel before her mother slides one to her. And another character is usually eating, hinting at part of her backstory.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s visual cues like these that make every thread of this web so strong. Sometimes they\u2019re obvious, sometimes they\u2019re subtle, but all the time they move the story forward. Knowing a character has a doomed fate, isn\u2019t the same as seeing them spiral to doom firsthand. Sometimes, a tragedy too obvious is the most painful to watch. Especially when the solution to their problems is clear, but young age and flaws stop them from making smart decisions.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all, tasking teenagers with the responsibility of essentially saving the world, realistically, wouldn\u2019t end very well. It\u2019s their necks on the line for one wish. Many of the character\u2019s reasons for becoming magical girls stem from well-intentioned naivety, but naivety is still naivety. It\u2019s not about being careful what you wish for, but the price you\u2019re willing to pay for your wish. Some of them have already paid the price of their wishes, while others are dealing with the brunt of costly miracles.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s the cost of a miracle that makes up one of the major threads of the story. It deals with someone who tries to convince others she did the right thing, but can barely convince herself. Her story crosses paths with a feisty hothead who lives for herself, smelting a fire-forged friendship. Another thread works in secrecy, for a person shrouded in mystery due to the way her story unfolds. And the last thread, from someone seemingly useless, is actually about getting closer to making a wish; she\u2019s stopped from taking action for most of the show, and it feels too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, problems surface in the show\u2019s writing because of \u2018why didn\u2019t they do this instead?\u2019 scenarios. There\u2019s also a problem with time. I would say people are fragile and can easily change, but the amount of time that passes in the story, for character development, can be a little fast thinking about it outside the story\u2019s context. So the show isn\u2019t perfect. The characters develop at a believable pace within the story but might not work outside of one, and the \u2018what ifs\u2019 of every situation will make the extra-nitpicky squirm.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the strengths of this show outweigh, outnumber, and outdo its nitpick-worthy problems. In addition to great visuals that paint a tight story and draw splendidly-written characters, is a music track that adds to its cast. The upbeat \u2018Credens Justitiam\u2019 matches the outlook of Mami, while the nostalgic \u2018Confessio\u2019 conveys jaded maturity for Kyouko. \u2018Conturbatio,\u2019 \u2018Decretum,\u2019 and \u2018Symposium Magarum\u2019 highlights how Sayaka changes through the story, while the ethereal \u2018Sagitta Luminis\u2019 is appropriately angel-like for Madoka. Finally, \u2018Puella in Somnio\u2019 and \u2018Inevitabalis\u2019 play different messages about Homura.\\n\\n\r\n\u2018Inevitabalis\u2019 describes the show especially. I rewatched this show knowing what inevitably happens, and the surprise factor gone. But, surprises don\u2019t make this show. Solid directing does. I noticed things on rewatch I hadn\u2019t noticed the first time around. There were visual cues I missed, like the \u2018exclusion\u2019 of certain characters from episode 10, and lines of dialog I caught that made previously \u2018weakly developed\u2019 characters like Madoka and Homura much better than I gave them credit for.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I mean when I say this show created a miracle. I rewatched it fearing I wouldn\u2019t like it as much, only for me to outright adore it. It takes magic for a show to keep its luster, but it takes a miracle for it to shine even brighter. And though I can\u2019t call it a masterpiece because my mind won\u2019t forget its minor flubs, my heart will likewise never forget the absolute pleasure of reliving the magic. The magic of Puella Magi Madoka Magica.",

You start watching it thinking  it will be something light and childish, and you got it all wrong. \r\nFirst, the story. It isn't necessarily outstanding, But the big thing about it is the hidden messages, the little details that are actually carrying a meaning, and the hours I enjoyed searching some answers on the web about little characteristics I discovered along my journey with Madoka and her friends. I respect the hours of work the links in the story probably took to make and i appreciated the lessons I learned while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the art. Considering it's a 2011 anime and comparing it to other great animes of that time, like fate/zero, I would rate it 8/10. But the fact of the matter was the budget Shaft studios had. They were limited and the simplicity was necessary. It actually added a personal touch to the anime wich i appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nThird, the soundtracks. Probably rating it 10/10 because I am emotionally attached to it but still, Yuki did a masterpiece. Nothing to add. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the characters. They were well built, had a clear personality and were relatable. Every connection made, from the soul gems to their very soul, was extraordinary  and extremely detailed. I absolutely loved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Madoka Magica was great and original! :D",

            "content": "Ahhhh. Mahou Shoujo Madoka magica (yes i'll  be a dick and write the whole name). THIS is not your average magical girl anime. If you go into this anime thinking \"oh it'll just be another Sailor Moon or another Cardcaptor Sakura\", well good cause that means that you've seen them. This anime is a deconstruction of the magical girl genre. If you don't know what a deconstruction is then Evangalion is an example of a deconstruction for a mecha. So if this show is your first magical girl anime you won't admire it as much. Anyways.....\r\nThis show is a master of surprise. \r\nThe storyis well written and well unexpected. I even thought this would be another classic magical girl anime. But, once you get to a certain episode, you'll see why this show is a master of surprise. This show is REALLY dark for the kind of genre it is in. But, it isn't as dark as other anime like Perfect Blue or Kara no Kyoukai. But compared to other magical girl shows IT'S FUCKING DARK.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are choppy at times. But, the things that really bug me about the art is the differences on where you watch the show. The tv release looks shit compared to the blue ray, but the blue ray looks like shit compared to the movies (The movies are basically the show missing a few parts).If you don't like shaft's animation than this may be a turnoff. Also, the Witches look like a bunch of really fucked up shit put together.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are pretty good. Especially the battle music (look up Magia on Youtube). But, the opening is kinda misleading  for the whole show being that it is pretty dark. The opening is like your classic magical girl opening. Happy and upbeat.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to discuss characters without spoiling the anime so I'd say that the characters are really good except for a few characters that i find annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is really nice especially if you like surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is pretty good. If you have never seen a magical girl show than try to watch one before you watch this. If you don't I won't complain I'm a really lazy too.",

            "content": "When this anime came out many people were drawn to it. Everyone was raving about it and saying, \"WHY HASN'T ANYONE MADE A MAGICAL GIRL ANIME LIKE THIS BEFORE?\" The answer is simple. Because the point of magical girl animes is to empower girls and Madoka Magica is basically supposed to be the opposite because it's a seinen manga/anime. I think many of us seem to forget that Madoka Magica is of the seinen genre and not at all written for teenage girls which is why it's so dark in plot. You can interpret the fact it is of this genre in a couple ofways: it's dark to attract the male audience who is shunned from magical girl animes (supposedly) OR because some men in Japan enjoy watching girls suffer. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, ignoring this fact Madoka Magica can actually be quite enjoyable to everyone because people can choose to ignore its origins and the darker side of Madoka Magica to take something good from it. And even if you don't care about any of this crap Madoka Magica is still very interesting and well put together for a 13 episode series. \\n\\n\r\nYou follow Madoka Kaname who is just an ~ordinary~ 8th grader and her friend Sayaka Miki in the beginning. Sayaka and Madoka meet this cat-bunny alien called Kyuubey who tells them to make a contract with him for in exchange they get one wish and after that they have to become magical girls and fight witches. This alone is already somewhat interesting despite being the premise for most magical girl animes (this other being finds some 8th grades, makes them magical girls, and then the rest is fighting the bad guys of the show, yada yada yada) and the way the rest of the show plays out is actually very human which is why I was saying you can choose to ignore the bad aspects you may find to pull out some good lessons. I don't want to spoil the rest of this great anime for you at all so all I have to say is to try it out (plus it's so short, why wouldn't you?). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the show, art is pretty great. You'll find it to be unique and interesting (especially the witches) despite how strange the characters might look in the beginning (well, at least I thought they were weird looking). The sound (music) is performed mainly by a band called Kalafina and it's just beautiful. The show really relies on the characters for the most part and their clashes and their friendships and in general, relationships so the characters are well established and interesting. As for enjoyment, like I said before, I can say that the majority of people coming across this anime will enjoy it. It's well known and I don't know many people who haven't at least heard of it. Overall, I'll give this anime a 9 and I recommend you go watch it.",

            "content": "Madoka magica is one of those shows that come along once every decade or so and changes everything about their respective genre and the way people view that genre. \r\nLike Evangelion did in the 1990s, Madoka manages to take a popular genre in anime and flip it on its head with a surprisingly thrilling, tightly written, psychological, dark show about what it means to be a magical girl. \r\nNow I've seen this anime twice and I got a different experience both times so I will be saying why this show is great and comparing through different viewings as to why it works and how myexperience changed whilst seeing it a second time. What were those changes? Lets find out shall we?\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Now many know that Madoka magica was falsely advertised as cute, innocent magical girl show. This was to trick people into lowering their defences so that they would be shocked by the quick change in tone from fun and care-free into a dark, physcological thriller.\\n\\n\r\nNow watching it for the first time, the show is exciting, gripping and shocking and is great fun to watch. However after watching a second time I found that the shock value wore off and it turns into quite a simple show and I got the gist of it in one viewing. The ending may need a re-watch but thats it.\\n\\n\r\nNow I gave the show a 9 so obviously its not a big problem I had as I loved other parts of the show. It is great to re-watch it to notice the subtler writing and dialogue that is placed throughout the series and to see it come back in future episodes which you may have missed the first time round but it was just something I noticed and was a bit noticeable and needed to be pointed out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now I'm only going to talk about the 5 main girls because to talk about other minor characters like Kyousuke, Hitomi and Kyubey and explain why I liked or disliked them and what did or didn't work with them would be a bit spoilery and I would not want to ruin the experience for newcomers.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion of the characters did change on a second viewing.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka: My opinion of her has not changed at all in both viewings. Quite honestly as a main protagonist she fails completely. A main character is someone who the story focuses on and someone who has direct influence on the plot thats going on around them. Madoka, herself, has no involvement what so ever in the plot and for 11 episodes just sits back and watches whilst the other girls change and get involved in the story. Madoka just cries and watches and doesn't get involved until the final episode, which is ironic as her only involvement is proabably the most significant event in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this could be another hint of the subtle writing and the fact that Madoka is not really the main protagonist but I can't explain that as that would be spoilery again. \\n\\n\r\nMami: She is probably my least favourite magical girl. Now people say thats just because shes not in it as much. I think thats a crap excuse as for example Kaworu from Evangelion is a hugely popular character and appeared in 2 episodes of evangelion. On my first viewing I liked Mami but as I watched the second time I realised she has no real personality and I didnt really care about her. Her motive was unclear and she could have used a bit more screen time. This is a reason why this show should have been longer but I'll talk about that later.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka: Easily the most well written out of the main girls. Her arc is very interesting considering I thoguht she was going to be the cliche best friend of the main character but she really was not. Now on first viewing I didn't like her and thought her problems were petty and childish. But on second viewing I couldn't help but feel bad for her and whenever I watch the show again, her arc always hurts to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKyoko: I really liked her personality. Her interactions with the characters were different and fresh in particular with Sayaka. On second viewing I realised that her backstory was really rushed. I mean she says her entire backstory in one speech in one episode. They could have used maybe one or two more episodes to really tighten up the character work a little bit but I liked her, she was a fresh presence on screen.\\n\\n\r\nHomura: Can't say too much about her as that would spoil the whole story but I found her backstory to be interesting. The segway into her revealing her backstory felt a bit quick and could have used more time to make the transition more smooth. But I liked her none the less.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Studio Shaft must have the largest bank reserves of any anime company in the world. This show is very distinct in look and is gorgeous to look at. It looked like Shaft were just masturbating on screen. It was just so gorgeous, some of the best I have ever seen, very fluid. Mami's costume design was my favourite. I loved the design of the witches, it was just so original and not what I was expecting. It really helped give the show a sense of identity.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Yuki Kajirua does a fantastic job here as well. The pieces she chose fit very well with the narrative whether it was the cute opening which misled people into believing the show was something different than what it actually was to the haunting theme when fighting the witches or the sad character themes.\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I hear \"Decretum\" I just have all the emotions come back to me and I go damn that is hauntingly beautiful despite it being only 1:49 long. It reminded me of a Hans Christian Andersen story and the kind of music I would want to hear in my head if I read his stories, in particular the little mermaid which madoka magica takes a lot of influence from.\\n\\n\r\nThe second end credits, Magia, not only highlights the show's real tone but emphasises the subtle writing and foreshadowing that you would miss on your first or even second viewing. Let me explain:\\n\\n\r\nIn the credits Madoka passes Sayaka who is ignoring her and looking down in sadness. Foreshadowing her arc in episodes 5-8.\\n\\n\r\nThen Madoka passes Kyoko who doesnt move or look at her at all. Hinting at her loneliness and having no one which is explored in episode 7.\\n\\n\r\nThen she passes Mami who is on the floor looking in an earnest pose for Madoka. Showing her loneliness and wanting a friend which is explored in episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then she passes Homura who turns around and tries to reach out to Madoka but fails to. Foreshadowing her story in episode 10. Then Madoka proceeds to run to what I guess is her wish.\\n\r\nJust more subtle writing which makes me love the show even more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a blast watching Madoka magica for its shocking and gripping story and emotional content. Even though this shock wore off on second viewing, it got me to notice the subtle hints that were placed in each episode to foreshadow either an event in a characters arc or backstory or personality. It made me appreciate the writing more.\\n\\n\r\n* I also didn't like how they changed the main character so suddenly (episodes 10-12), it came out of nowhere and if Madoka magica was a bit longer, it could have meant for a smoother transition. A nitpick quite honestly.*\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Madoka magica is great. Despite there being some character stories that felt rushed and some characters who were just there for plot devices, i.e. Hitomi and Kyousuke, this show is a true accomplishment in what you can do in only 12 episodes and is one of my favourite anime and I look forward to re-watching very soon.",

            "content": "I don't quite remember why I decided to watch Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica, but I do know for sure that it was one of my finest decisions anime wise. It's a show that I always highly recommend to anime watchers.\r\nIt's easy to be fooled by Madoka Magica. As you start watching you feel the familiar mahou shoujo theme: a group of young girls who are approached by a cute talking animal who wants to partner up and help them fight evil, whilst in frilly and girly outfits. But under this illusion Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica reveals itself as a memorable masterpiece.\r\nThe Story:\r\nTo become a Magical Girl youare granted one wish. What will you choose?\\n\\n\r\nStarting out smoothly, this anime truly begins on the third episode. This is the point at which the viewer realises that behind the guise of a cutesy show lies the cruel and hard story of the reality behind being a Magical Girl. The turning point of the episode happens so unexpectedly that it left me dumbfounded for quite some time. However, this was but the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses you are faced with the many perils of the the five girls, Kaname Madoka, Miki Sayaka, Akemi Homura, Tomoe Mami and Kyoko Sakura. Despite its short length Madoka Magica manages to flesh out all of its female leads, and given that character progression and development are central points in this anime it presents us with the girls' fears and expectations, their past and the motive for which they chose to make a contract, and while there was an undeniable favourite for me, Akemi Homura, I found myself empathising for all of the girls, their distinct personalities and stories with all of them having traits I adored and related to.\\n\\n\r\nThe most powerful moments of this show are key situations for the character's development and the story progress, and while I will not spoil them I can simply say that they were cruel, heart wrenching and utterly powerful, completely shattering the illusion created by its first episodes\\n\\n\r\nBy the twelfth episode I was fully aware of the show's emotional power and its ability to make me feel for its characters, having felt an almost full spectrum of emotions. However the ending managed to once again surprise me, succeeding to wrap up this tale in the most perfect of ways, twisting and turning the show's own world. Finale wise I am yet to find a better anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artwork:\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica has two very distinct art styles. The normal one is the one present in the character designs being bright, colourful and somewhat simple and childish. However, as the girls find themselves in the witch realms the artwork changes completely, switching to something entirely unique, featuring a magazine collage like theme in dark, vivid colours, combining real and drawn elements in a delightful manner that still maintains its cutesy way.\\n\\n\r\nAs I see it this contrast contributes to further cement Madoka's genre, the twisted magical girl anime. It helps disguise the nature of this show's world, shrouding it in an aura of cuteness making you not expect all it throws at you. It's hard to see harm come to cutely-drawn girls in a fantasy-like witch world, and that is exactly why it is so good when it does happen. It plays with your expectations as a viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music:\\n\\n\r\nThere are not many anime shows that have me listen to the entirety of their soundtrack after watching. But then again, there are not many shows like this one. The music is superbly executed, either blending eerie vocals into multi instrumental backgrounds or being purely instrumental, helping establish show's emotional tone. As a part of the series' soundtrack each magical girl was given her own theme song that subtly reflects her personality and dives into her views of the world, complementing both the character and her very own story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall View:\\n\\n\r\nBeing absolutely outstanding Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica is an anime you should not let yourself be fooled by, and one you should definitely set as a priority, with its compelling characters playing into a rich, superbly written story guaranteed to make you feel even if you try not to.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Madoka Magica was by far the most interesting anime I have seen. The story starts very lighthearted and girlish, but quickly turns into dark horror. The story was very thought out and planned. The music soundtrack was amazing. The character personalities were introduced thoroughly. The anime was hard to stop watching. (I watched it start to finish at 2:00 in the morning). Madoka Magica was a masterpiece. However, I did find one thing that I didn't like. The faces were too flat for my liking. After about 5 episodes, I forgot and stopped caring, but the flatness of the faces almost stopped me from watchingthis in general. Most other anime reviews about Madoka Magica state that one must watch this until episode three. Episode three was a huge plot twist, but in my opinion, you can't drop the anime until episode 8. If by then you don't like it, then fine, but for me episode 8 was the big one. Most people are thrown off by episode 4, because most of it is just girls crying, but if you can make it through that episode, then the rest will be very good.",

This anime keeps amazes me every twist and turn is something new and its all about interaction. Im falling for Madoka.. SHE IS HUMAN. Her Ideals and such make you think really what does it really mean to be a magicalgirl.. Yest its grim ... and the animation can get silly sometimes.. But I can honestly say that I will refer this anime to anyone.. it appeals to girls and boys on some levels. The opening is adorable and sweat where as the ending is so dark and grim..

            "content": "This is my first review on M.A.L., so please bear with me here. \r\nI found \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica\" by flipping through Netflix when I got bored. I thought it looked stupid, but it wasn't like I had anything better to do, so I decided to sit down and watch it. I was horribly wrong to judge this show before watching it. After episode three, I had to go to a Fourth of July party with my family but didn't want to stop watching, so I (rudely) shut myself up in a room and completed the series in one day! Screw Independence Day! That's how goodit was! I skipped a party! It's my absolute favorite show to date. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the specifics. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis isn't your normal magical girl show, like Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. Madoka Magica truly depicts what challenges the magical girls actually go through. How it interferes with their life and turns it upside down, messes with their emotions, inflicts fear into their minds and keeps them from fulfilling everyday duties. I can't even describe how much torture all of these girls had to go through. This may not seem like a very original plot now, but Madoka Magica does something else that other dark fantasy/tragedy magical girl titles don't. It creates a complex plot that messes with your feels and seems totally cruel. It's all so deep and meaningful. There is so much packed into this 12-episode show. There really is. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nYou either like it or you hate it. This is how it goes. I think the art has had a huge impact on me. It's amazing. It would earn a ten, but SHAFT's style really divides up everyone into the groups of liking or hating it. It always does. I especially love how they did the witches. I thought that they were on drugs for a while. It's so detailed and unexpected, which perfectly matches what this show is all about. Not to mention how the girls are drawn, too. I find the style very cute and lovely. I also love the animation. It's just so wonderful and I never noticed any awkward poses or movements. Also, the colors change slightly to fit the mood. Have you ever noticed that when Madoka and friends are magical girls fighting witches, their hair color, skin tone, eye color, and outfit colors get a little more vibrant? The attention to detail that SHAFT had was amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe opening and endings were very good. I loved how they tricked me! The ending theme in the first two episodes was all cutesy and happy with that picture of Madoka and Sayaka (and if I'm remembering right, Hitomi was there too, right?) and that definitely threw me off. Then in episode three, the ending changed to the darker, creepier and more serious \"Magia\" by Kalafina, which definitely fits the show better! The opening is also great. I can play it on my flute and I always get lots of compliments wherever I go from other Madoka fans!\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are also impressive. They definitely fit their character and almost never faltered. I especially loved the contrast between first timeline Homura and present Homura. \\n\\n\r\nOh, might I also mention the BGM? Fantastic! It leaves me speechless!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAt first, Madoka was your ordinary protagonist. Nothing special about her but OH MY GOSH! She gets an amazing opportunity! She's enthusiastic and not as smart! And Sayaka as the ordinary side character. The tomboyish best friend who always teased her.  And Mami was your cool, friendly, good-at-everything upperclassman. And Homura was the mysterious, \"cool\" character. And Kyubey was your equivalent of Luna in Sailor Moon. \\n\\n\r\nUntil this show screamed, \"HAHA! Just kidding!\" right in my face. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development is the best part of this show, I might argue. Madoka learns to put others before herself but also not to let herself be stupid and get everyone else killed along with herself. She learns a lot about herself. Madoka learns that not everyone is made for greatness, but she could help someone else be great- and possibly work hard to achieve something good herself. \\n\\n\r\nSayaka learns that things don't always work out the way you want them too. Sometimes it's better to be realistic than optimistic, but to never lose hope. She learns to always protect her friends and be there for them no matter what. Sayaka grows so much. She reminds me so much of myself that it isn't even funny. I love her so much. \\n\\n\r\nHomura develops the most out of everyone, in my opinion. She, like Sayaka, learns to protect her friends no matter what. She also learns that sometimes you have to sacrifice some things to get positive results. Also, what's done is done. You can't (always) change the past. She has to learn to suppress emotion and deal with the consequences of her actions. This entire show depends on Homura. Homura also reminds me of myself in the sense of loving friends and doing anything to protect them. \\n\\n\r\nMami learns that she can't always be the best, and sometimes in a crisis virtues don't matter. She also learns not to flaunt her stuff or act so cool. She develops the least, sadly, but this is justified by her lack of appearance in the show. \\n\\n\r\nKyouko learns to sacrifice some things for others' good, and that you can't always be a hero. She learns to utilize her resources and enjoy herself. She also learns that even if you don't like someone, teamwork is better than battling something individually. She actually develops a lot, but I'm getting a little tired and this review is a little too long. \\n\\n\r\nKyubey...let's not elaborate. You can just watch the show! He doesn't really develop anyways. \\n\\n\r\nI loved these characters so much. I cosplay as Homura all the time. I doodle them on my homework a lot (oops). I have fallen in love with them and you will too. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters:\\n\r\n-Hitomi: I hated her. She's so stuck up. I hate what she did to Sayaka even after how loyal she always is to her. She and Kyousuke definitely belong together! They are both stuck up, spoiled rich brats who never ever consider anyone else's feelings!\\n\r\n-Kyousuke: I hated him too. See above.\u2191 He's just so mean and selfish! I get it, he was in an awful situation, but that doesn't justify his actions! Sayaka gave everything to him! And in return, she was tossed out of his life like a piece of garbage. \\n\r\n-Madoka's mom, Junko: I love her, despite her imperfections. Her willingness to help Madoka and protect her family is awesome. I love her self-confidence, and the confidence she has in others. Her advice is really good and deep, despite the fact that she's drunk when she is giving it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have rewatched this series over and over again and loved it more every time. I think that rewatching it actually makes your experience with the show better, and it's easier to understand that way. I have watched both sub and English dub. The dub isn't THAT bad, but the subs are definitely better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThis show truly is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone will enjoy this show. Man, woman, boy, girl...all people will enjoy this show. Watch it. Now. Just do it. Stop reading this and go watch it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I really didn't think I'd like this show. Sure, I heard tons of praise about it from many people, but I still didn't expect much from it. But when I finally got around to watching it, I couldn't stop. I was so engrossed in the Anime that I finished it in one sitting, haha. Anyways, on to the review.\r\nStory(9/10): The thing about Madoka Magica is, that it's not really a magical girl Anime as one would expect from its name. Right from the first few minutes, it's pretty clear that it steers clear from the typical magical girl path. Infact, this Animeactually takes all we know about the genre, puts it into a grinder, and then puts them back together. Basically, deconstructing it to form something entirely different. The story is actually really dark, which was actually pretty good. I'll give a brief coverage of the story without spoiling anything. Basically, a white, red-eyed cat-like creature called Kyuubey forms a contract with girls, where he can grant one wish of her desire, but they in turn have to become a Magical Girl and fight Witches. The story takes an episode or two to really get going. But from then, it just keeps on getting better and better, with dramatic twists that I didn't really expect. Finally, the ending itself is ambiguous, which was kind of a shame since I expected a bit more from it. Then again, in an Anime like this, a happy ending wasn't really expected.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10): Animation is done by Shaft. So there isn't much to say it about it. It's top notch, as expected. Head twirls, sudden change of camera angles, all the Shaft goodness is here. The action scenes in particular are beautiful, with brilliant effects and lighting and other such small details. The art really shines when the Anime becomes dark. The character designs are childish, which some people may find odd, but I liked it that way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10): I have no complaints in the sound department. The soundtracks during light hearted and intense psychological parts of the Anime fit wonderfully. Yuki Kaijura did a spectacular job, as usual. The Ending is dark and moody and is really great. So great infact, that it was used in a few action sequences. As for the Opening, it's like a typical magic girl Anime's opening, which is a huge contrast to what the Anime actually is. So, it could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(8/10): The main character, Kaname Madoka is a normal girl attending school. She's cute, shy and timid. But meeting Kyuubey changed all that as she had to go through a lot of ordeals which she had a real hard time dealing with. Still, she's a really likeable character. Now we go onto my favourite character Akemi Homura. Without revealing much about her, she has the most character development in the Anime. Initially she seems cold and devoid of human emotion, but we later get to know more about her dark past, which made me liker her the most. We also have Miki Sayaka, who is Madoka's best friend. She's cheerful, energetic but really does things on impulse on multiple occasions. Her actions actually hurt Madoka a lot, though I could understand her reasons for doing so. We then have Kyouko and Mami. Kyouko seemed hostile at first, she grew on me as a character, especially after we came to know of her sad backstory. As for Mami, she's probably my least liked character. Reason is that she really didn't have that much of an impact on me. Sure, we was a veteran magical girl and all, and we get to learn her backstory too(which was a bit bland to be honest) but I just couldn't care for her that much. Overall, most of the characters are great and will leave an impact.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): I thoroughly enjoyed the Anime. Sure, the ending could've been better and it had a bit of a slow start. But inspite of all that, I loved it for all it was worth. If you're looking for a unique Anime with a great plot that'll draw you in as you progress and one which you won't be forgetting anytime soon, then by all means, watch this. You won't be disappointed. I sure as hell wasn't. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(actually read if your gonna mark this  unhelpful, not just because you don't like the score i gave it)\r\n     Now if you had told me back in 2010 that a magical girl anime could be dark, or have a remotely good story,  I would have probably  laughed at you, and went on my merry way. Now in 2013 I can truly tell you there is one great magical girl anime. At least one good one, and thank god for that. This is because I generally  hate magical girl animes. As imsure you have all heard from many in the anime community that this this  is an amazing anime.you don't need me to tell you that. Yet is it the greatest anime of all time? is it the anime we all have waited for? No and no. \\n\\n\r\n        Madoka Magica is not as it seems, and you have probably heard this from every reviewer on MAL.  You have heard that Madoka is a \"deconstruction\". I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said otherwise. Now what truly got me hooked was not the fact of it being a \"Deconstruction\". When I watched it for the first time in 2012 I was such a shonnen lover that i didn't even know what  Mahou Shoujo meant (therefore i go in without any bias). After the first 2 episodes I was about to drop the show wondering how I ever came to watch such a thing. Then the 3rd episode hit, and like any fan will tell you $#@% gets real, real fast. To me it wasn't a deconstruction while watching because i had no idea it was a magical girl anime (I knew sailor Moon, but nothing else).  From episode 4 on Madoka  had my undivided attention, and I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the series.  For Madoka Magica its all about the story, which much to my surprise was insanely good. Yet, only so  if you go in open minded and look past the frilly dresses. The true narrative before you will then present itself(NO SPOILERS HERE). Yet the story results with enough suspense, intrigue, and feels to keep your undivided attention. Its more like Faust than a Magical girl show. It turn me from someone who watches FMA and one piece, to someone who watches Steins;Gate, Mushishi, and Mawaru Penguindrum. It is not the greatest story ever told, but pretty damn flawless IMO(10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n          Now the Art style and direction is beautiful.  Yet not the greatest work SHAFT has ever done. Yet, IMO pretty close to it. Madoka Magica in its art has created some Trippe and dark moments. Mostly due to the \"Witch Labyrinths\". Now within these labyrinths are many examples of symbolism. Its this that truly got me going. Many of which I didn't see in-till a 2nd watch and are extremely obscure. They mainly allude to classic  literature such as: The Little Mermaid  or Faust (just to name a couple).  Now one thing that is the problem with the animation is the fact of SHAFT. They have a habit of rushing animation, and thus some things are not totally smooth. This is not noticed till a later watch. Yet, it is there none the less. May I suggest to you that you watch the DVD Ver. ? it has corrected many of the animation mistakes and will increase the Trippe lvls by a factor of 42 . (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n          The Sound of he show is top notch. Yuki Kajiura does what Yuki Kajiura\\n\r\ndoes. Make an epic score. The Osts are wonderful, the best being Sis Puella Magica, the \"main theme\". Some of Osts are epic but more leaning at  beautiful. This is appose to her work in Fate/Zero, which goes more at Epic. In Madoka the score uses  weeping strings and flutes, with a combination of more epic pieces. Yet,  I would say the violin is the principal instrument. The Ed's are also is extremely amazing.  With Magia being so epic it is sometimes used as a battle theme.  Episode 9's aEd deserves some props and   \"and Im home\" truly gave me some feels (DVD Ver. only). Yet, out of the songs the op is probably the worst, yet is not bad, just later on in the series seems very misplaced...(9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n           Now Characters are the hardest hit. They are in a 12 episode series that focuses on plot, and thus have little time for character development. Many people find this to be the bad factor of Madoka, and I agree. Characters themselves don't seem to last enough for us to grow too attached(oh gawd that is spoiler territory).  IMO its not the Character personality that makes them. But, that each character represents a concept(if you look for it its there >:D). Yet, the base personalities are pretty typical. Its not to say the Characters are bad, they are very good for the series size.... just not on par with the rest of this show.\\n\\n\r\n           As a final word Madoka is a great story, I would recommend it to most. I also would say it  will be enjoyed by most. But, will only truly be amazing to some. It also probably will leaves a few wondering how this could ever be good. With a pacing( episodes 4-12) that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Tons of feels, an amazing art direction, all rapped up in a 12 episode package. It is no surprise how Madaoka has become on of the most popular, critically loved, and divided animes of the last decade. Madok Magica in my eyes is not, the greatest anime ever. Yet, is up there in the top 50. Weather you like it or not Madoka Magica has made an impact. It  is here to stay. and I proudly give Madoka Magica A (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are some creative works so good, so entertaining, and so powerful in their message, that they transcend the medium that they originated from and become something greater.  They become something  that any person who calls themselves a lover of art or story telling or anything in between must see.  \r\nMadoka Magica is one of those creative works.  Madoka Magica is a show that not only belongs on say Netflix or Toonami.  Madoka Magica belongs in fine arts classes, womens studies courses, journals on film and literature criticism, etc.  It is not just a good anime, it is atranscendent piece of art that if you ever want to show someone who is not an anime fan just how great the medium could be, this is what you pull out.  Not Naruto, not even Evangelion, Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 10\\n\r\nI wont bother going to far into the actual details of the story as I am sure if you are reading this you either A- already know the major twists, or B- don't and dont want to be spoiled.  I will just say that the surface level intrigue of this story and the way it manages to start so small yet become incredibly huge by the end while still holding at its seems is amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nMore significantly, i want to touch on the downright inspiringly awesome feminist subtext of this show.  Initially as the show began i thought maybe as a male i was reading to much into, but as the show continued i knew i was dead on.  Madoka Magica is a symbolic endictment of patriarchal social structures and the way that these structures use and abuse women for the \"greater good\".  Again, i won't spoil it too much, but the show has some deep messages about women in society and it is so good and perfectly woven that i suggest any person with any type of feminist slant in their mind check it out.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10 Yuki Kajiura.  That is all.  She is the only composer i have learned by name.  That, and the ED is fricking epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9.  Here is the only place where there is any semblance of weakness.  The characters in the story are not overly deep or complex.  They are tools.  They are there to represent ideologies and issues within society and they do that well, but it is at the cost of well fleshed out motivations and character build up.  The show is only 12 episodes long, it would have been impossible for the creators to make such a dynamic and deep story with such a big message AND have well fleshed out characters too.  So is still give this really high marks because the characters definitely do what they are tasked with.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10  The normal art and animation is nothing special, looks very similar to your typical Moe show. But that is the trick that makes it so amazing.  The moe style contrasts with the incredibly dark and intense reality of the show to further drive home the messages within the show.  Also, the battles and design of some of the villain characters are like something out of a Salvador Dali fever dream.  Again, it is an amazing work of art that everyone should see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10 There are only a few anime that i bring to non anime watchers in my circle.  Most of them have been stretches that i think they may like.  I have forced my wife to watch many things and only a few of them didnt make her roll her eyes.  When we finished Madok Magica we talked about it for a week.  Now mind you we are both blessed with high levels of education and scholarly minds that enjoy analyzing and breaking down complex and depthful things.  Still, even if we weren't the show has plenty of twists and turns that even at the surface level you can greatly appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica is now my favorite show of all time.  It is so good and so impressive in its narrative and it's message that i dont even think it makes sense to call it a show.  I want everyone to see this, not just anime fans, not just sci fi/horror/drama fans.  EVERYONE should see this show and talk about it with their friends, especially their daughters and little sisters.  IT is that good and really it's probably the most important anime in recent memory. \\n",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is a deconstruction of the Magical Girl genre, and I would say a very good one at that. It is a series known among its fanbase for being something that will take your expectations, cut them up, douse them in petrolium, burn them, throw them off of a ten-story building, rip their nails off, drown them, and hand those expectations right back to you two days later. It is an exciting ride full of twists and turns, and an enjoyable one, at that.\r\nSTORY\r\nMadoka starts normally, following the most stereotypical magical girl formula: Cute animal turns schoolgirls in to magical girls so they canwear puffy pink dresses, fight evil, find love, and all that boring material that WE HAVE ALL SEEN BEFORE. Ah, if only it were that simple... The truth is, this series is full of dark, depressing material, that only shows itself when you least expect it.  Being 12 episodes, it is completely lacking in that fatty filler material that many slice-of-life magical girl are sometimes known for, and thank god, too, because I quite frankly find filler to be quite boring, and lacking in any intellectual or intense content that I so love in anime. Other than those first few episodes, it is extremely intense and plot focused. And quite frankly, I am glad that those first few episodes are as they are, because it helps make the 180-degree turn all the more shocking. It has a solid ending (assuming you don't watch rebellion), and great character development. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI rather liked the art of Madoka, although in the version I watched it in had rather plain and simple backgrounds. This didn't really distract me though, and the backgrounds were not by any means the thing I was paying attention to, by the time the show made its massive switch in tone. For its characters, it used a moe art style reminiscent to one of Studio Shaft's previous works, a slice-of-life known as Hidamari Sketch. It might have seemed out of place had the show not used Higurashi-esque methods for the faces (though to a very low scale) and dark, dreary colors. Overall, it worked for the lighthearted bits, and oddly enough, it worked for the dark bits as well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe soundtrack from Madoka was composed by Yuki Kajiura, and turned out very nicely. Kajiura tends to do work on the darker series, so it was a role fitting for Kajiura, and she did a very good job. Mami Tomoe's theme was very goiod, I liked Sayaka's theme, and Nux Walpurgis are all worth mention at the very least, but one particular piece stood out to me for different reasons- the ending. The look of the ending isn't anything really special, but the music is some of the best I have heard out of an ending theme as of late. I tend to just skip endings, but Magia was a very good song, that made up for the otherwise boring ending sequence, and was is worth watching, for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe character's are relatively stereotypical at first glance, but develop beyond those stereotypes that they were initially given. As the show progresses, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka, who are learning about the magical girl's world, and are considering  becoming magical girls, slowly crumble in to despair, depression, and even insanity... The other characters each have something that separates them from the stereotypes of their genre, be it ulterior motives, past obligations, or emotional baggage, all undergo at least a little bit of development, and even with the ones you don't, as the show goes on you get to learn all about each one respectively, and by the end you know and love each one as a character. I have two main problems regarding the character department; I felt one was rather lacking in screen time, and I felt that Sayaka was rather lacking in wisdom; she has a belief in justice, which is all good, but there is more to the world of both common humans and magical girls than justice, and she would have done well to understand that nothing comes without a price, and that you reap what you sew, as Kyoko puts it.  commend Madoka for not rushing in, and becoming a magical girl immediately, as that was an intelligent choice, and in a cruel world where not everything is as it seems, such a caution is a very good trait to have.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\\n\r\nAs stated above, Madoka is a thrill ride that is full of twists and turns, and has a deep and psychological story that will really grip and engross you until the very end, as soon as the show picks up. It is an intense story that puts the lighthearted, fluffy demeanor of the magical girl genre and drops it in to a cruel, realistic world, that uses your very own expectations to become great. I finished it in one night before I even knew what was what, and it was not something that I would ever want any lover of the magical girl genre to miss out on. The beginning is rather boring, and nothing that I haven't seen before, but if you get past the initial silliness of the thing, it becomes an enjoyable rollercoaster. Of the problems, the main ones are the slow start, the plain backgrounds, and character decisions that I considered lacking in intelligence sometimes, though chances are that won't bother you, as I seem to be among the minority in having that opinion. I can fully recommend Madoka to just about anyone, and similar shows include along with Princess Tutu (another dark magical girl), Neon Genesis Evangelion (a mecha deconstruction), and Tokyo Mew Mew, for those looking for a cutesy, stereotypical show. It streams all legal-like on Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Netfix.\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this series as much as I did, see ya later!\\n\\n\r\nKari-san",

            "content": "\"Don't forget, always, somewhere, someone is fighting for you. As long as you remember that, you are not alone.\" \r\nMadoka Magica is a masterpiece of an anime that I can't believe I didn't come across earlier. In fact, if it weren't for my favourite reviewer raving about how great it is, I would have passed it up if I had just seen the poster and description of the show, because the show is SO MUCH more than an anime from the magic girl genre. This review will contain slight spoilers (not revealing any plot details that's for sure but if you've yet to complete theshow I suggest you to just watch it blindly without any hints because it'll ruin the enjoyment). \\n\\n\r\nTo start off, the poster, opening, as well as the first few scenes of the anime is deceiving to say the least, and if you didn't know better you would have assumed that this was a colourful fun show about magical girls saving the world from danger! Wrong wrong wrong. This show takes the fundamental concept that exists in our realistic society, \"nothing is free in this world\", and from there this beautiful story is blossomed. I have to say that the constant reiteration of for every \"hope\" there needs to be an equal \"despair\" in order to maintain the equilibrium was done so splendidly. It wasn't the in-your-face way of portraying, through boring exposition or repetition by the same character. Well yes kyubey, the familiar constantly reminds us of that, but that always happens after we are SHOWN how this idea works through different happenings along the show. And at first we don't think much about it, the girls in the show brush it off and so do we as the audience because this isn't a new concept, its something that is so familiar to us and yet taken for granted. But gradually, as the hopes and wishes grow, so does the accumulation of despair and sadness. Not to mention this story is EXTREMELY original and unpredictable, it keeps you confused and speculating what's going to happen next, and while you hold on to the hope of something happening, it never really does, yet you're surprised by how they're able to twist the story here and there, without being too far-fetched or deus ex machina-ish. Everything is well thought out, well planned, and the flow of the story is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, to the different characters. (WHY ISN'T KYOKO IN THE POSTER T_T) Every character seems to fall under some sort of troupe at first, but as the story slowly flows, you realise how mistaken you are about them and how different they turn out to be. And I absolutely love their character development. Within the short span of 12 episodes they manage to bring out the dynamics of the 5 main characters, they past, their stories, their emotions, their flaws, their strengths, their regrets, everything. And the best part is that you think you know the main character, but you don't at all. The transition is extremely smooth without inconsistencies and abrupt shifts and their actions are justified throughout the series. You FEEL for the characters, you feel their pain, you understand why they did certain things, but at the same time being the on looker you question why they're so foolish, so selfish, why they can't see the picture. And at the end of the day you do understand why, and that is because they're human. And to err is human. \\n\\n\r\nNow the animation is really interesting. The witches' realm is shown through a different stlye all together, a rather creepy and eerie one if you ask me and I think its just perfect. The action scenes aren't that many but they're smooth and detailed enough. The music of the show added on to the greatness of this. With a mix of emotional to outright chills inflicting songs, it really sets the mood of the scenes and brings out the best in it. I'm listening to the ost as I'm writing the review because it is that good. Also, THE OPENING <3 Please please pay attention to the lyrics of the song, there is a huge spoiler embedded within it and when I first realised I was so WOWED. It made me love the opening even more. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Madoka Magica is one of those shows that lights a spark within you, keeps you thinking even completion and despite it being a fantasy, how it parallels reality is freaky as it is. But please have mental preparation that this show is pretty dark and impactful, it will leave a mark on you. It's a beautiful show about friendship, sacrifices, miracles, despair and hope. I give it my utmost recommendation.",

            "content": "This was yet another case of \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" for me this year, the first being Made in Abyss. Both shows had an art style that turned me away at first, but both ended up being great experiences that I'm happy to have gone through. \r\nDespite it's genre being outside of what I'd typically go for, and some slowness in the first few episodes, give this show the full 12 episodes before judging it. It's not even that long, and you will be amazed at how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's an amazing experience, and definitely one of those animesthat will stick with you for a long time.\\n\\n\r\n**spoilers**\\n\\n\r\nTalk about a bittersweet ending! Madoka becoming some sort of a magical anime girl version of Jesus was completely unexpected, and I found it seriously refreshing. My perception of the show changed so dramatically over the course of the 12 episodes that I'm honestly impressed that the it could was pulled off so smoothly. Unlike many shows that start off with a bang and fade in quality over time, Madoka gradually kept getting better and better. While I think the show lost some points with me on the rushed ending, the buildup to the apex of the show was excellent and I'm impressed at the range of emotions the creators were able to give me in just 12 episodes of content.\\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of time travel into the show, which is shown in episode 1 but not explained until much later, was done quite well but did not feel quite as clean as the implementation in Steins;Gate. I can't really put my finger on it, but the final episode just felt a bit fuzzy, rushed, and confusing at the very end. Perhaps there is additional material that will explain some of this, but the fact that it wasn't packaged together neatly marred the ending of the show. It's also understood that Madoka's wish created the universe, but how exactly was Homura placed in it? If Madoka is all-powerful, why can she not figure out some way to eliminate the wraiths? \\n\\n\r\nEven if there is some explanation I'm missing, I don't feel that shows should have confusing endings. I was extremely impressed with the second half of Madoka until it bit off more than it could chew, in my opinion, in the final episode. Had they given it another episode to explore everything \"post-wish\" as well as the full ramifications, it would have been much more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the story was great and had much more depth than initially anticipated. Also worth mentioning was that I found the sequence of events in the show hard to predict in the second half, which is a GOOD thing! The second half of the show also had truly massive emotional swings , plot twists, and interesting philosophical aspects that were all introduced very well. \\n\\n\r\nI ranked art as the lowest category here for a number of reasons, mainly because I (still) don't like the character designs. And as much as I appreciated the art style we saw inside the witch's labyrinths (ESPECIALLY the orchestral hall created by Sakaya Miki as a witch), I didn't feel that the art was a very strong category here.\\n\\n\r\nSound was quite good. I appreciated the generous amounts of focus on stringed instruments as a result of Sayaka Mikis' backstory. \\n\\n\r\n**NOTE: I originally rated sound an 8, and after listening to the OST by itself upgraded to a 9. The quality was hard to pick up while distracted by the visuals :) **\\n\\n\r\nCharacter was a hard one to rank, because I felt that some characters like Kyuubey and Sakura Kyouko were strong while others like Mami Tomoe and Madoka Kaname didn't have as much of a foundation as they should have. The lack of substance for Madoka Kaname relative to the others was particularly problematic due to her central role in the story. She was a stereotypically nice girl that just wanted to help others. That's not a bad thing, but even her mother had more interesting quirks about her. Madoka didn't appear to have any flaws, and that made her less real to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was an 8 to me because of the ambiguity of the ending and the slowness of the beginning. The first four or so episodes were hard to get through, and that has to be accounted for here. However, there were a few 10/10 episodes in the second half of the show that really did elevate this series out of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nI struggled between giving this show an overall of 8 or 9. When this problem occurs, I revisit my ratings for older anime and try to consider things from a relative point of view. In my book, this show was more or less on the same level as Elfen Lied (an 8), and definitely below Steins;Gate which I have as a 9 so I've assigned it an 8. I feel that it definitely could have been a 9 to me had the ending been wrapped up in a better way. Having said that, I definitely understand why a lot of people consider this anime as a masterpiece.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(7.0/10)\r\nOne of the greatest anime ever... for eleven episodes. \r\nI can't believe I've held off watching this show for such a long time. I've heard many things about it. How its visual style is beautiful, how it subverts expectations, how it's dark and brooding. I still put it off though. I was either busy with life or simply busy with other television.\r\nI've finally watched it. All twelve episodes. \r\nEnter the bubbling cauldron that is the mind of The Butcher, the mind of the killer that wrote the series. The mind of someone who so willfully thrusts himself into the realm of dark writing and escalatesit into compelling drama whilst never letting that suffocate the series. Urobuchi Gen utilizes his reputation to warn viewers of whats to come. Three episodes in we get a wallop that an unsuspecting victim could really love and a suspicious Suzie could gleefully indulge in. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the heads begin to roll they really don't stop until the finale decides that it's had enough fun. By that I mean it decides to try its best to make the last twelve episodes feel meaningless. Saying it underwhelmed me is a massive understatement. It was perhaps one of the most underwhelming climaxes to anything. Beyond that, we get eleven episodes of pure chaotic fun. Fun that really captivates and enthralls, no less. With assured direction from Shinbo and some electric music, we get a non-stop barrage of noise, unique animation, and some outstanding cuts sprinkled right on top. \\n\\n\r\nWe follow Madoka as she makes the dumbest decision of her life and becomes  Magical Girl. Something filled with sparkles, rainbows and the occasional depression after your close friend gets utterly eviscerated in front of your eyes. Wait, what? A harsh juxtaposition between the witches rifts and the modern high school shrouds this show in an alien vibe. How beyond every corner there could be a lurking witch ready to enrapture you in a world, unlike anything you've ever seen. These worlds, or rifts, operate on a single aesthetic. We're talking some Alice in Wonderland on acid themes, too. From upside-down cakes and pastries to syringes and medicine. It's all a wonderful spectacle to behold and if you want to see some truly outstanding creative design, Madoka might be the perfect series for you.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, through the cacophony, there are moments of true characterization too. While it won't blow you away, the characters here do end up standing out. The only weak link here ends up being Madoka who unfortunately stands by the wayside a lot of the time and doesn't get involved with some of the better character-driven moments. Particularly Sayaka gets some real gems throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, the show dies. Not in the good, way, either. Not in the way that makes you cheer and throw more popcorn at the screen. It peters out. The final episode is a dud of epic proportions. Without much meaning behind the actions, the rest of the show droops like an aging tit. It really hurt the overall experience and while the series as a whole is an easy recommendation, it isn't without preface. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like this show, I'll end this with a dishonest and fake statement. The mountain was never there. The climb never happened. The concept was always false. The story was always the same. The characters were never compelling. The idea never formed. If you enjoy anime, watch the show. The first eleven episodes are a marvel. When the time comes to watch the finale, however, close your eyes and wish for something real.",

            "content": "(Some Spoilers)\r\nGoing into Madoka Magica, all I'd heard about it was \"you don't know what you're getting yourself into\". To me, this is one of the biggest problems with the show; It relies on being compared with other shows in it's genre, rather than it's own qualities as an independent anime. It's not great, it's just better. But if you were to remove the prejudice and expectations that comes with being a \"magical girls anime\", and simply judge it on it's own merits, it's nothing special. \r\nIn other words, Madoka Magica falls victim of the \"cheerleader effect\", a cognitive bias where individuals appear more attractivein a group than on their own. For instance, the show gets pretty dark after a couple of episodes. But because of how not-dark these types of shows usually are, it feels even darker, simply because the audience didn't expect it. But is it really that dark? Sure, some characters die, but that's not very uncommon in anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd why should I even care if some of the characters die anyway? it's not like the show ever gave me a reason to. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional, and the little development that actually occurs is almost exclusevly handled in exposition scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty avarage and boring. It feels like 6 episodes would have been enough. Because except for the beggining and the ending, all that ever really happens in the show is the girls fighting between themselves, moping about how bad life is, and being busy trying not to move the plot forward. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not saying that Madoka Magica is bad by any means. It's just not as good as it would like to think it is. It wants us to see it as the masterpiece it could've been, instead of the one it failed to be. It's the equivalent of a bad artist presenting his work by saying: \"trust me, the painting was beautiful in my head\". \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Somewhere in this world, someone is fighting for you.\r\nWitches and Demons, that cannot be seen in our eyes, are all over the world, dragging people into despair and causing depression, murder, suicide, and many other crimes.  It is the job of Mahou Shoujo(Magical Girls) to find and kill them before they have their way with other human beings.  \r\nIt sounds like becoming almost like an Hero in a movie where you can save people's life.  One life that could save many; it doesn't sound bad but almost too perfect.  If one useless life can save these people than there's no reasonto hesitate...  That is what they believed...\\n\r\nAfter their death, witches drop a small item called \"Grief Seed\".  These are used by MahouShoujos to cleanse their own \"Soul Gems\".  If it isn't cleansed for a while, the MahouShoujo will lose her life.\\n\r\nIt didn't take too long for them to come to realization of their mistakes.  Like witches, they became invisible to everyone.  Their sacrifice was not there to be seen by the people.  Countless number of people were saved by their actions, but nobody was there to witness it happen.  You will not thank someone for something that you don't see them do; you will not praise someone that you cannot see.  This was now reality: you are risking your life for some guy you could possibly careless about and you will never be appreciated.  They too got sick of this and they no longer fought for anyone.  For pure reason of survival, they had no choice but to fight.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nMy only intentions for this anime was for some MahouShoujo Moeness.  From the very first episode, I do not see Madoka become a MahouShoujo.  Starting from episode 2, the only reason I continued this anime was to see Madoka become a MahouShoujo.(I will not be happy for a LONG time.)  Instead of Moeness I get ridiculous amount of drama.  I was totally dumb-founded and speechless by the end of the series.  Immediately I desperately searched the web for the culprit behind my tears.  \\n\r\nGoogle: Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica - Wikipedia\\n\r\nWritten by: Gen Uro- *FACEDESK*\\n\r\nGen Urobuchi have clearly been proven to me that he is a dangerous existence.  The World started to make sense again.  The story of MSMM was very similar to Fate/Zero, where he proves the misconception of justice.  I would have prepared myself for this, but I did not even imagine him to be associated with a MahouShojo Genre.  He has rewritten the genre in such beauty; his story has brought me to tears once again.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI found MSMM's art to be pretty sloppy in many ways.  Actually to reword it, It wasn't at the best works compared to many other animes.  The motions weren't very fluent and sometimes the characters seemed as if they weren't sketched at it's best.  Most of all, I found the wiggly worlds really unappealing.  The whole witch and everything were not even animated.  I was totally disappointed about how ugly the monsters were...  There was a cotton with a mustache that had butterfly wings as it's legs.  (That's damn creative, I'll give credits for that...)\\n\r\nWell the reason why I'm not gonna go hater is because there's a really good excuse for this kind of art work.  To begin with, MSMM was produced by Shaft studio.  Starting from 2004 Shaft has been working on lowering their paint group and replacing them with the digital group.  Their digital group has been growing since then and the results have come out in 2009 and 2011.  Yes, Bakemonogatari & Mahou Shojou Madoka Magica.  Even the best studios in all of Japan is desperate for better paint group but lowering it was declaring that they wished to go bankrupt.  However they disguised the weakness of their sketches and paint works by many digital and computer affects in such genius ways.  I've seen improvements in Mahou Shojo Madoka Magica so I'd say they really deserve a pat in the head... or a round of applause...\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme was very catchy.  I heard Claris sang it, who also sang the opening for Ore no Imouto...  It sounded more like a pop song of some kind but the opening video did a really nice job to highlight the dark theme of the anime.  The musics that they used in the \"wiggly land\"(I'll call it wiggly, cause the images are wiggling) were gave great impression of thrill and the chill.  Some of the musics really hit the spot to make me cry in the right moments and I've never really sensed any awkward moments where that one little note seemed as if it was lost...\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDespite being all depressing and dark themed anime, as MahouShojos all the characters still have their Moeness.  This is probably the reason that gives even stronger impact to the people.  It makes you wonder why these kinds of moe 2D girls have to suffer being a MahouShoujo...  Madoka's excessive kindness, Sayaka's sad yet energetic, Mami's lady-like senior, Homuro's mysterious background and extreme talent, Kyouko's tomboy attitude.  All of these characters don't seem to be the most original ideas.  However the story moves on while each of these girls' lives are being distorted and changed. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe story was never too repetitive nor did it ever slow it's pace.  It kept me impatient yet flowing in the right pace.  One episode never ran boring all of the sudden nor did the other standout excessively compared to the others.  It kept the right rhythm of the ups and downs like the graph of sinX.  I decided to stay up to finish the series despite the fact that I had SAT exam the next day.  Short but it has carried out a very heavy topic.  It's very easy to watch the series in one shot...\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\noverall 10/10\\n\r\nStory was good, not because it made me cry, but it also gave the most exciting ending.  Art was fairly interesting, but you really should prepare for the different style.  Music of the series really helped to keep the climax of a scene.  Characters were just unforgettable, and it kept the night before exam very enjoyable.\\n\r\nuhh maybe not a \"masterpiece\" but probably one of the outstanding and must-be-recognized anime.  \\n\r\nIdk about others, but I wish they'd finish this with a short OVA of a nice epilogue.  Nothing big like a movie or 2nd season.. totally disagree...",

            "content": "Note: I ain't no english speaker\r\nMadoka Magica is overrated. That being said, Madoka Magica is a great anime. I have watched this anime several times analyzing and taking into consideration all the aspects that compose its essence, substance and style. Due to this analysis I've been able to reach different conclusions regarding what aspects of Madoka Magica make it a great anime, and in which aspects this anime fails miserably. Before hating, please I encourage you to read this review carefully.\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE\r\nOn this point I am pretty sure that nobody will argue with me: Madoka Magica is visually amazing and sounds beautiful.\r\nThe overall art stylechanges from joyful and full of colour to dark and creepy in a matter of seconds. But this transition is done with great animation, stunning effects and specially breathtaking backgrounds. Combined with moe characters, this use of art and visuals add a lot to the shock factor that the anime aspires to.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was really well done and the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura is masterpiece as always (although I am getting a little bit bored with her work).\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nAlright, here is when things start to go downhill. I am not going to spoil anything but you should read MAL's resume in order to understand where I am going. Basically, Madoka Magica is supposed to be a deconstruction of the magical girl genre the same way NGE was a deconstruction of the mecha genre. Madoka bets on its shock factor: it deceives you into thinking that you are watching a cute and nice show about girls with pretty dresses and magic, and suddenly it turns into a dark world full of suffering and misery in which the threat of death is real and you need more than just \"the power of love and magic\" to survive. The combination of top-notch fights with stunning visuals, and absolutely heart-breaking situations in a dark and constantly deppressing world was a lot of fun.\\n\r\nHowever, in terms of story Madoka Magica felt unsatisfactory due to two major problems: conclusion and pacing. The first one is easier to explain: Madoka's ending sucks, big time. Is a complete asspull \"deus ex machina\" that leaves enormous unsolved plotholes, unanswered questions and feels like it was made up at the last moment. And no, the 3rd movie didn't provide a satisfactory conclusion either. It just made the plotholes bigger and threw more questions on the table. The pacing problem requires me to talk about the characters, but let's just say that the series felt rushed. It was going too fast.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nConsidering that Madoka was supposed to be a psychological thriller, you would expect Death Note-tier or NGE-tier characters that could drive the anime instead of the action and the story. Well, sadly Madoka Magica's characters are average at best.\\n\r\nRegarding characters I feel obligated to discard both Mami and Kyoko. Mami is a Mary Sue, supposedly the most perfect of the magical girls, who lacks any personality beyond her super-confident attitude, any backstory or any motivation. As for Kyoko, she is your typical badass character, with not-so-clear motivations or objectives, a 5 min. speech backstory, and a rushed, messy and inconsistent development.\\n\r\nKaname Madoka is one of the (if not THE) blandest main character in the history of anime. She lacks any kind of development. Her personality is  nonexistent, except for her obvious shyness and fearfulness, and the only thing she does is question herself for 12 episodes on wether or not she should become a magical girl. With the exception of the totally unsatisfactory conclusion, she plays no role in the anime. Literally Sayaka could have taken her spot and be a better MC.\\n\r\nThis leads me to Sayaka and Homura, the two characters that save this cast from being downright terrible. Sayaka starts off as a naive and energetic character. Contrary to Madoka she has clear goals, and she has a multi-directional perspective as a character, meaning she has different worries and objectives. Her development is really well handled and she evolves clearly but with subtlety, turning into a completely different character (but not in a messy way). Unlike Sayaka, Homura lacks a multi-directional perspective. She has one goal and one goal only, although she indeed pays attention to different things and she approaches her objective through different means, meaning she has a wider range of thought than most characters. She also has a clear backstory that reflects her intentions, and a development just as well handled as Sayaka's.\\n\r\nAll I am going to say about Kyuubey is that he is awesome and he totally rocks.\\n\r\nBack to the pacing problem, it has a lot to do with Madoka. I feel that the anime didn't have enough time for her and instead they just threw her development on the last episode as a big ball of unexplained things. This seems weird, wasn't SHE supposed to be the main character? I am sure that having Sayaka as main and completely erasing Madoka would ended much better for the series. Or having more time to focus on Madoka might have gave us a well developed girl that transformed from a moeblob to an all-around 3rd dimensional goddess.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Madoka Magica? Yes, I did. I did greatly enjoyed it. As a matter of fact I constantly encourage people to watch it because I believe is one of the most fun and well done anime I have ever seen. On the other hand though it is true that it poorly handled its main character development, its pacing and ending, thus leaving a bad taste in many viewer's mouth that maybe were expecting too much.\\n\\n\r\nStill a great deliver by Shaft that I higly reccomend.",

I'd heard about it and thought 'hmmm...meh' after looking at how girly it is.\r\nHowever, I decided to give it a shot, and I'm definitely glad I did. From the beginning, the surreal-esque artwork that deviates from the generic anime style and the music from Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina set up this anime. \r\nWithout spoiling anything, it's a magical girl anime that by far sets itself apart from most generic magical girl anime.\r\nStory: 10 out of 10 - the plot is initially simple, but gets gradually more complex as the series goes along.\r\nArt: 10 out of 10 - theanime style alongside the different styles incorporated through the witches' barriers were amazing. The transformation sequences were amazing, too!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 out of 10 - the voice acting for the Japanese version was great, the English dub was okay, but I wasn't quite feeling the English Homura. The soundtrack, as well as the opening and endings were amazing, too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 out of 10 - goddamnit Kyuubey. That is all. Favourite character? Probably Kyoko, although I do have a Sayaka t-shirt somewhere...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 out of 10 - enjoyed this a lot more than I originally thought. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 out of 10 - yep.

            "content": "It sometimes bothers me that people advertise Madoka as a morbid deconstruction of the magical girl genre. First of all, taking a genre full of roses and choosing to emphasize the thorns is not in itself an indication of quality. Furthermore, if that\u2019s what you wanted you\u2019d need to look no further than to the appropriately named Revolutionary Girl Utena from the late 90\u2019s era. In truth, anime fans have peculiar ways of promoting their latest obsession which might have caused quite a few to perceive this show as the typical piece of generic storytelling so commonly adored by the majorities but ultimately unsatisfying. Surprisinglyenough, they\u2019d be incorrect.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably familiar with the synopsis by now but this is a magical girl anime provided with a long row of increasingly dark plot twists. Unlike some shows that wait until the very last episodes to show off their unexpectedly sadistic agendas (School Days, Narutaru); Madoka is a process of gradual revelations that depict the lifestyle of a magical girl as anything but cheerful.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the clich\u00e9s from the genre are piled up but are either altered or provided with emphasized significance; no decision is to be hastily made and the contractors hold little to no regard for any moral responsibilities it might be appropriate to respect when you make adolescent girls fight and die for your cause. Ultimately what the show produces is not only a thought-provoking story structure and almost flawless pacing (no scene here is ever excessive) but also a refreshing lineup of both familiar tropes like transformation sequences and relatively fresh material like the seemingly inevitable and hauntingly dark fate of any magical girl na\u00efve enough to think her decision to join the battle was a good one.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBased on somewhat objective measurements like frame rates and coloring, Madoka is far from average. The character designs may look unappealing at first but are perfectly assimilated into the scenery to look distinctive rather than annoying.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show, really, truly, shines though is when it comes to the battles. Interestingly enough, the antagonists in Madoka are witches capable of ensnaring their victims in nightmarish labyrinths where twisted imagery is combined with downright bizarre creatures and backgrounds for an effective assault on your retinas. Basically, what you get are various magical girls and their trademark weapon of choice battling their way through surreal worlds equipped with everything from industrial objects to sweets. It\u2019s almost as if they took the artistic virtues of Lynch, Burton and Studio 4C in order to create something very comparable but in the end also very original.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the poor girls are voiced by competent actors and boast impressive performances under their respective archetypes; Madoka is na\u00efve but incredibly kind, Homura is cold (for reasons later revealed) and Kyoko is fierce etc.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, this is the first show I\u2019ve seen with a soundtrack made by Yuki Kajiura. That does not, however, mean that I\u2019m unfamiliar with her work. Oh no. That woman is a miracle worker capable of producing jaw-droppingly beautiful music. Here she uses a long row of various instruments to fuel her creativity only to top it all off with a powerful choir. Madoka\u2019s soundtrack ranges from mundane, sad, often mysterious but is always well-made. In combination with strikingly haunting visuals, the music here is absolute gold.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs previously implied, we\u2019re dealing with rather common archetypes here. However, as the show makes progress their typically one-dimensional personalities are expanded rather impressively as they face tough decisions and encounter more and more powerful enemies. Much like Evangelion, a lot of the character development takes place during the witch battles themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAt the center of all the commotion is Madoka, a protagonist who receives surprisingly little screen-time and instead spends the first half of the show observing the development of her friends. In most cases it\u2019s a bad thing to place such a minimal focus on a main character but it\u2019s executed just fine. In the end, the personalities here are not particularly deep in and of themselves but when forced to interact with other entities, especially under life-threatening circumstances, they can produce absolute awe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably heard many things by now and I feel like I\u2019m just jumping on the Madoka fanboy-wagon when giving the show such a high rating. I do not hesitate, however to call this the best anime to be released in the past few years along with titles like Kaiba. Its fans do a better job of poisoning its appeal to potential viewers than they do promoting it but that is by no means a reflection of its quality. This is a show that works fine in every single regard despite coming off as stronger in certain areas. Even if you end up feeling that the story and characterization were poorly structured (which I\u2019d disagree with) you\u2019re likely to still have enjoyed it based on its technical merits alone. There\u2019s no real reason not to watch this!",

            "content": "I should I say this, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica or Puella Magi Madoka(or simply Madoka Magica, as I like to call it) is not your average Mahou shojou anime. As I have deep rooted loathing for cute-looking, frilly dresses and cute transformation scenes, I never really planned to watch this anime. After reading such good comments about it I felt a bit left out, so I decided to try it without getting my hopes to high. After finishing it though, I was really amazed. How in the world did I not only watch the entire thing, but am still craving for more? Well, without furtherado, let\u2019s get on to the review and see the reasons.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Madoka Magica is more or less a story-driven anime, my kind of type. To make a brief summary of the story, it is about a girl named Madoka who meets a rabit-cat hybrid thing called kyubey, who will grant one of your wishes. In exchange, you will have to become a mahou shoujo and fight evil witches. To tell you frankly, the story seems so clich\u00e9 that it\u2019s painful to read but no, Madoka Magica is way more than just that. At the first few episodes, I could have sworn that continuously watching this might make me lose my manliness, and that I might have to wrestle with a bear just to get back my balls. Although at first it starts out like that, with cute stuff everywhere, no, it is just disguise that will enhance the eerie mood of the later episodes. What made the story so good is that the change in its theme, from a light-hearted anime filled with cute girls and frilly dresses to a dark anime filled with sorrow and darkness. Though that on its own would not have made it great, it was along with the execution that made it great. The transition between the two was so smooth that it completely took me by surprise because you don\u2019t see it happening, it just happens gradually. Another good thing about it is that even though it turns dark later on, it doesn\u2019t lose its core theme, which is mahou shoujo. Even though the setting turned different, it was still the same frilly dresses and the same cute girls, it doesn\u2019t change. And with that, I give it a 10/10 for a story that despite its outward appearance, managed to pique my interest and make me question whether I should forget my hatred for this genre.\\n\\n\r\n Art and sound: The art is more of a hit and a miss. For me who\u2019s more of a guy who likes the clean and slick animation that most new animes sport today, as well as more normal faces, I didn\u2019t really like the art that well. Sure it cute and moe, I guess it just comes down to preference with this type of things. One thing I can\u2019t deny though is the awesomeness of the fight scenes. As fight scenes in this anime usually happen inside the witch\u2019s world, it would only be fitting for me to describe it to you. It is a very weird place wherein everything seems like it was hand drawn with chalk, with visuals that rival that of the randomness of Nisemonogatari. Now back to the fight scenes, they are wonderfully animated, something that I didn\u2019t expect out of an anime in the mahou shoujo genre. The fights were fast, smooth and even epic in some scenes. As for the music, they were true masterpieces. The opening which has a lively, upbeat tone perfectly complements the beginning of the story while the ending has a sort of dark feel to it somehow gives a sort of premonition about the later episodes. All in all I give it another 10/10 in both fields because I have nothing to complain about them, they\u2019re perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, seeing as this is a mahou shoujo anime, you can expect a lot of cute girls. And what do girls do? They laugh, eat bentos on the rooftop, talk about love and boys? WRONG! Well, at least for this anime. Although those things I mentioned earlier aren\u2019t completely incorrect, Madoka Magica developed the characters in such a way that over time, they turn dark, revealing things that you would never expect. Heck, even the familiar kyubey was developed into one of the more amazing characters I\u2019ve seen. To put it simply, character development in this anime is wonderful. It wasn\u2019t rushed, it wasn\u2019t over the top, but just right.10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really can\u2019t tell you why I enjoyed it, it just is enjoyable. It made me laugh, it made me sad it made me excited, and it made me feel all fuzzy inside, something that the newer animes fail to give me. Overall I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Nothing much to say, except that this is indeed one of the best animes of 2011, and I highly recommend it for everyone to watch. Just beware though because this anime can give you a bittersweet feeling at the end. I give this anime a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nWait, WTF, why only a 9/10 when you gave it like 10/10 in all criteria? Well, this is a MAJOR SPOILER so if you are planning on watching this anime, turn back and don\u2019t read it. Now, my reason is that I didn\u2019t like the time travel concept in this anime. Yes, I know I might sound a bit biased but it\u2019s just that Homura  creating multiple timelines, Madoka  becoming a god and changing the laws of the universe and stuff like that just didn\u2019t tickle my fancy like other animes did, Steins;Gate for example. In other words, they didn\u2019t do it well, or at least not as good as an anime focused on actual time travel but instead made a couple of plotholes at the very end of the story, making look messy and overall disappointing. For short, I didn\u2019t like the ending. Although I said this, it might have been done deliberately in preparation for the movie and so, that is my reason.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked my review, a simple click on the helpful button will help a lot.

It felt like the protagonists and antagonists  had been set out from the start. It seemed like it was a simple story of good against evil.\r\nThen came the third episode and onwards. At the end of the third episode I was crying. They attach you to the characters so much that it was such a shocking moment.\r\nAnd from there the series kept getting darker and darker. Every episode had some sort of bombshell, which something terrible happening each episode. Andthe backgrounds and colours would darken alongside the show.\\n\\n\r\nNothing seems out of place in this anime. The dramatic music is perfect. I felt like I was able to relate to a few of the characters myself. And the story is written so that you never expect what will come next. And the deception of the cutesy anime at the start was very cheeky of them to do, but it was a great touch for people who wouldn't like an anime which starts out with a terrifying beginning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that PMMM was a great anime and I'm glad that I had watched it. It is one of my all time favourite animes and I still remember some of the scenes that shocked me the first time through and there is a lot of value in watching again and again.",

            "content": "Clearly \"deconstruction\" at this point has become the \"Meryl Streep\" of anime: people just LIKE the word and praise its \"sophistication\" just like how people awe over at the name \"Meryl Streep\" even though I've met people who didn't watch a single film starring the actress -_- Ultimately, Madoka Magica is a series that has been given too much credit imo for just BEING a deconstruction. \r\nMadoka Magica clearly is a deconstruction series. You can tell from the chilling, goosebumps-inducing ending theme at the 1st episode that is by far my favorite. But my question is, why go CRAZY over the word \"deconstruction?\" At theend of the day, this is just another story device like irony, deux ex machina, etc, that exists to elicit uniqueness and stand out from the crowd just like how EVERY OTHER anime SHOULD be doing IN THE FIRST PLACE. All this hype over deconstruction just tells me how low the bar for mahou shoujo genre has become that people are going crazy over a series that managed to actually stick out. This isn't a celebration of greatness. This is a living proof that this genre needs to improve significantly. With that main complaint out the way, I have some pros and cons.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\nliked the opening. loved the ending theme. \\n\\n\r\ndoes do a solid job of actually executing deconstruction especially with Kyuubey. \\n\\n\r\ncharacters that I thought would be sidelined were developed more than I imagined (esp. one particular one that I was very impressed with).\\n\\n\r\nKyuubey became increasingly more horrifying with genuinely thought-provoking observations about human nature and his purpose and mission actually made sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending \"bit more than it could chew\" but I was still on board and was satisfied that it committed to its uniqueness until the end.\\n\\n\r\nno forced fanservice (to be fair though, fan service in this type of animation would've made me feel like a criminal)\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\nhated Madoka Kaname. she's the Lisa (Zankyou no Terror) of the series. bad example of using crying animation that ended up generating more annoyance than feels.\\n\\n\r\nfor a 12 ep series, pacing was slow --> it could use more editing (cutting)\\n\\n\r\nnot a fan of this kind of animation \\n\\n\r\n(personal cliche I notice as a student): why be in school if you're never, ever going to study...\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you're curious on what \"deconstruction anime\" means, give it a try. I don't highly recommend it for I think you can find better examples in other visual mediums and books. I don't recommend the third \"revolution\" movie either. \\n\r\nWhat I want to lastly mention is the sad catch 22 this anime has. I think I personally would've enjoyed this much more (be surprised/impressed more) had I not known that this was a deconstruction. But given the state of mahou shoujo genre, I don't think I would've tried the series if nobody mentioned the unique factor of madoka magica.",

            "content": "\u201cMadoka\u201d isn\u2019t your father\u2019s version of a magical girl anime anymore. Akiyuki Shinbo\u2019s \u201cPuella Magi Madoka Magica\u201d is a haunted anime that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. It creates characters we come to care about. That\u2019s because of the performances, because of the direction, because of the writing, and because of the superlative technical quality of the entire production. This anime, and to a lesser degree \u201cMagical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\u201d (also a Shinbo-directed work), redefine the possibilities of the \u201cmagical girl anime.\u201d\r\n\u201cMadoka\u201d is not a simplistic tale of good girls who choose to gain magical powers to fight evil. The girlsare good, yes, the witches are evil, yes. But \u201cMadoka\u201d poses a more complex puzzle than usual: The witches\u2019 ability to bring death and despair to the citizens of Madoka\u2019s hometown requires someone to step up to eradicate the threat. But is it worth sacrificing your mortal soul for all this? Enter Kyuubei, the cute mascot-like character who is more than a villain. He\u2019s a Mephistopheles whose lack of empathy and amoral outlook pose dilemmas for all would-be magical girls, especially when many aren\u2019t told of the risks and are too innocent to ask for the fine print.\\n\\n\r\nThe key performance in the anime is by Emiri Katou, as Kyuubei. Her rendition draws power from her matter-of-fact delivery. Though Kyuubei lacks the malice of \u201cBokurano\u2019s\u201d Koemushi, it is precisely the way Kyuubei\u2019s lines are spoken that make the character more despicable. At least Koemushi was being purposefully cruel and even if we cannot condone such behavior, it\u2019s not outside of our experience. Kyuubei\u2019s actions fall outside the scope of what we\u2019re used to as he takes a Machiavellian stance towards what must be done for the good of the universe. In short, he\u2019s a sociopath\u2019s sociopath. Throughout the anime, he continually nudges the girls to enter in the contract without a care for their fates, enticing them with the fulfillment of a wish as a reward. This Faustian bargain effectively threatens the whole moral foundation of the magical girl genre.\\n\\n\r\nBecause these characters and the situations they find themselves in are so powerful, and because the anime does not allow its spectacular visual effects to upstage the narrative, we\u2019re surprised how deeply the drama affects us. Eri Kitamura does an especially good job as Sayaka Miki, whose character is transformed by a simple wish into a bitter monster. The same can be said for Yuko Goto\u2019s performance as Madoka\u2019s mother, who dispenses with sage advice when called for, but who begins fretting for her daughter towards the end of the series. And let us not forget Kyoko\u2019s final prayer. It is customary in an anime to maintain a certain knowing distance from the action, to view everything through a sophisticated screen. \u201cMadoka\u201d slips around those defenses and engages us.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the visual effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and catastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate depictions of a descent into madness. The setting in which \u201cMadoka\u201d takes place is a wilderness of skyscrapers and unfinished construction sites that carry a hint of danger in their unbuilt state. Especially noteworthy are the alternate witch dimensions that seem like they were taken from Salvador Dali\u2019s surrealist landscapes and Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream.\u201d It is through these worlds that the characters fight in and, ultimately, die in.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot involves nothing more or less than a girl\u2019s attempt to save her friend from a horrible fate. Kyuubei\u2019s deceit, combined with a tragic series of events, is what sets this all in motion to begin with. The twists and turns that come along are complex, with all credit going to Gen Urobuchi\u2019s screenplay, which has more depth and poetry than we might have expected.\\n\\n\r\nShinbo also directed the previous, and excellent, \u201cLe Portrait de Petite Cossette,\u201d which explored the darkest corridors of the human psyche. Now, Shinbo has taken his experience from \u201cCossette\u201d and materialized them into \u201cMadoka\u2019s\u201d cruel twists. There are a series of flashbacks and time-jumps that make us realize that this conflict is borne by children who have fallen victim to cruelty \u2014 they compensate by trying to do good and fulfill their wishes, but when the final revelations come forth, all that\u2019s left is despair. If they didn\u2019t understand it then, they sure as hell do now.\\n\\n\r\nSomething fundamental seems to be happening with magical girl anime as a whole. \u201cCardcaptor Sakura\u201d may have defined the classical high point of the traditional magical girl anime. A show like \u201cNanoha\u201d allows its director to combine the excellent battle scenes typical of shounen series with the magical girl genre to bring to the attention of a male audience. But now, \u201cMadoka\u201d moves the genre into deeper waters. They realize, as some anime viewers instinctively do, that these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes. And this reinvention of the magical girl genre is the most fruitful one for exploration.\\n\\n\r\nIn \u201cPuella Magi Madoka Magica,\u201d Akiyuki Shinbo has freed the magical girl character to be a canvas for a broader scope of human emotion. For all the magical girls in \u201cMadoka\u201d face deeply troubling decisions, let there be no doubt, and if ever the despair begins piling on, it would not surprise me the extent of the harm these characters are capable of inflicting upon one another.\\n\\n\r\n(With apologies to Roger Ebert)",

            "content": "OVERALL (If you aren't going to read the whole thing just read this): Madoka Magica was the show I didn't want to watch because of how girly it looked, I was fooled  and impressed by the show. It had the gravity of dealing with death, maintaining normality, the brutality of repercussions, and the bonds of friendship. It was beautifully drawn, with a soundtrack to match, and storyline that will take your heart away. If anything else, why not give Madoka Magica a shot?\r\nSTORY: Madoka Magica was a roller coaster ride from the first ep to the finale, at first i wasn't sure what iwas getting myself into shortly thereafter i was on a wondrous ride which just seems to have went by so fast. And fast it did go, in one night I finished this 12 episode show and am just hyped to write about it. At the end of it all I just wanted to stay and go for another ride. I couldn't have asked for another storyline like this, unlike Mass Effect 3 you feel a sense of satisfaction after watching and although you may want to change the course of things, well it just wouldn't be the same if you did.\\n\\n\r\nART: The artwork in Madoka Magical dealing with witches added the surreal feel that just fit in so well with everything else. It was beautiful and was exactly what it needed to pull me into this world full of witches and magical girls. Though the character designs were cute I couldn't help feel that every female character looked like an adolescent and I wasn't too fond of facial structures.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music for Madoka Magica couldn't have been any better for the show, seamlessly flowing with the mood of the show, the action scene music is something you will likely youtube while you are in your own personal battle. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: With a 12 ep show its hard to really grasp any character and hold onto them. Madoka along with Homura develop quite well, solidifying there place in your heart as characters you will not likely forget anytime soon. Kyuubey the cute emotionless cat like alien is adorable, but at times you may want to strangle him for acting like a douchebaggish salesman.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Start to finish with only a break to answer my door to get pizza and koolaid I thoroughly enjoyed the show. While thinking to myself well it looks like a little kids anime, I found the popularity of the show to be absurd and saw myself having to check it out for myself. One of the better decisions as before the first episode was over I was sure I was going to love this show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is amazing in my book for a number of personal reasons, and I really hope I can remember to write them all as I type this. \r\nThe one thing I praise Madoka for is being a modern take on a genre of anime that is either really old/not that popular. What genre is this you ask? Well none other than the deconstruction genre of anime. The best one I can think of to this date is Neon Genisis Evangelion, and while being on two opposite sides, are very much on par with each other in terms of storytelling (Just one isn't as confusingas the other). \\n\\n\r\nStory: In case you missed, this is a deconstruction anime. Which means it takes something that's very popular in a genre (in this case magical girls) and instead of showing you the good like everyone else does, it in turn shows you anything and everything bad that can happen with this concept. It takes something everyone wants to be, and tries its best to convince you that no, this isn't what you want at all. Madoka Magica does such a good job with this. \\n\\n\r\nI also describe this to my friends as a devil in disguise. I put this off for a while just by looking at the cover art for it because it honestly looked like another magical girl anime (and we all know we NEED another one of those right?) but boy was I wrong. Somebody told me to watch to the end of episode three, and the shift that happened in that episode was unexpected and terrifying. From that point on, it turns into something completely different and shifts further and further every three episodes. For something with twelve episodes that does this kind of thing should be taken in regard because it could have been very easy to mess it up (cough School Days cough). \\n\\n\r\nArt: Studio Shaft never fails to impress. From Chobits to Hidemari Sketch to Bakemonogatari, Madoka has a solid studio with a solid grasp of how to do this kind of thing. The art changes from bright and cheerful to dark and ominous, to outright depressing so well, it almost gave me whiplash. The art also has this thing where some scenes look polished, and then some will look a little roughed out, but it fits with the tone and the context of what's happening. Another thing that can't be forgotten is the scenes that play when each Witch shows up. Those are nothing short of amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice wise, its basic to me. I saw this when the sub was coming out so I didn't watch the dub. The real gem that lies in the sound is the music. Its whimsical, its dark, its fast and confusing, and it actiony (is that even a word?). Not a single piece of music feels out of place in this anime. The opening music is great, and so is the ending music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I can't really get much into this without spoilers,so I'll just say this; If you're the type that gets attached very easily, I'm so sorry for you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: Anime like this come once in a while. Neon Genisis Evangelion is one, and so is a good part of Gantz, along with recent anime Re:Zero. These kinds of masterpieces need to be taken into account for all the kind of story they have to tell, as well as how they tell it. I adore this anime to pieces for just the swell and twists and turns of emotions it brought, and how strong the bond of friendship can actually be for someone else. My only downfall with it is I can't seem to find all the episodes on DVD for a reasonable price, so I just settled for downloading them onto my laptop.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Madoka Magica is required to watch. At least a try to the end of episode 3 nothing more.",

            "content": "This isn't your average magic-girl show, it is unique for its genre. But while being different holds the potential to be great, it doesn't inherently make it thus. There is endless praise for Madoka Magica, but delving into the pot of shining 10s, they are all based on its \"deconstruction\", it's breaking of standards, the depiction of the flaws and strengths of human nature. And while I'd argue Madoka does a subpar job confronting those ideas, even if I were to simply ignore them, what you're left with is an otherwise unpolished show. \r\nSince every other review speaks exclusively of those aforementioned topics- I willfocus on the other aspects instead. It may be unfair to willfully avoid the bulk of Madoka, but so is labeling it a masterpiece regardless of its obvious and plentiful flaws. My goal is to convey why I didn't find Madoka to be an 8+ anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nA very small cast- good. There are 4-5 \"Main Characters\" + an antagonist. This is perfect for a 12 episode show- no complaints here. But when you only have 4-5 characters to develop, I expect their development to be consistent and rational. Yet every single character does a complete 180 when convenient for the plot. And those turn arounds are so expected and patterned you can precisely guess who will suddenly change and when purely via their looks and screen time. All characters started off in a great standing, so for them all to turn out exactly as expected was incredibly disappointing. \\n\\n\r\n**slight spoilers until next section** This is especially true for Madoka. Madoka simply *does not* change. She sits in the background of the plot for its entirety (literally), and when its her turn for her 180, its unoriginal, uninspired, and contradictory to everything the show stood for. Its like everything she heard and saw went through one eye/ear and straight through the other. Her actions just don't make any sense, let alone her 'power' being complete BS dues ex machina and an undeserved one nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nArt + Sound:\\n\\n\r\nGreat. The music was very fitting, varied, accompanied the right moments, and was genuinely fun to listen to- I'd argue this was the best aspect of the show. The overall art was nothing special, but it worked with the theme and remained consistent. The scarce 'magic-girl action' moments were creative, visually appealing, and truly interesting.\\n\\n\r\nPacing:\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely horrendous. Usually bad pacing is something I'd attach to dead-time in tournament arcs or filler-like episodes, but Madoka, being a 12 episode show, does a terrible job at managing its time. The first 3 episodes were the hook, and was successfully executed. This means the rest should plot about: 50% for the meat of the story, and 25% to its conclusion. Instead the story appeared to become driven directly by the mangaka, not the characters nor story. \\n\\n\r\nNothing of interest _ever_ happens if not for divine intervention by the author. And while this is just usual lazy writing, these interventions are so vaguely and sparsely placed there is an immense amount of downtime, and for the most part, not properly used. Especially when character development is lackluster, action or meaningful drama is missing, and our main character still can't make up her damn mind knowing she'll have to eventually do it anyhow. \\n\\n\r\nPlot holes:\\n\\n\r\nThe major hole was so massive it was a serious detriment. Obviously minor spoilers, but I'll try to avoid specificity. The broad prospect of the show is the implication of magic. The magic-girl gets to request a single wish, and in exchange becomes a magic user with her future solely used to fight evil. This concept is necessary for the show's purpose, but is executed very poorly- in all its aspects. \\n\\n\r\nThe pre-magic-girls wish can be *anything* and i mean ANYTHING. There is absolutely no restriction on their requests. Thus it appears the wish-provider selects girls who are in desperate need or otherwise momentarily mentally unstable to make an impulsive wish that won't cause unnecessary hassle. We also know there isn't a lack of magic-girls, in fact, there are too many. Via that provided piece of information alone, the decision making process both our MCs continue to use is straight-out flawed. But even earlier, the notion Madoka & Sayaka were chosen as potential magic-girls doesn't make sense since both were not in a desperate need of a wish, unlike every other magic-girl in existence. \\n\\n\r\nMadoka and Sayaka had the time to choose *any* wish they could imagine. World peace, global removal of disease, family's eternal safety, etc.. But they don't do it. Why? The show itself declared anything is possible, but they choose to limit themselves, fully aware of the opportunities. Let alone both taking way too long. \\n\\n\r\nThe wish-provider is emotionless- but he isn't. He is the embodiment of Utilitarianism- but isn't. There are moments where he claims he didn't \"trick\" anyone, because he doesn't even understand the concept of tricking. But throughout the show his favorite pastime is to trick and deceive people. His selection of Madoka and Sayaka is also not utilitarianism in nature, he should've stuck with desperate girls. A very, very flawed character- and it deeply hurts the show.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the ending. The ending throws every \"deconstruction\", every thought and realization the show provided straight out the window. Madoka tries so hard to illustrate the hypocrisy of magic-girls; these small, feminine, caring, prepubescent girls, sent out with cheers and excitement by the viewers-- straight into the claws of hardship and inevitable deaths. It hammers this realistic approach to fiction over, and over again- because that's all it has to latch to. By doing so it enforces ideologies such as: Hope and despair always balance out in the end, emotion in the long-term will be used & abused, and interactions or any reliance on others will surely lead to sorrow- but are necessary. These are all controversial of course- but the ending of the show contradicts everything. In a complete turn around, out of nowhere, the power of kindness and friendship prevails! It was predictable, idiotic, and completely against everything the show itself explored and realized.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to re-watch, I could pick up on a dozen specific unquestionable plot holes entirely due to bad writing or insufficient detail. An average of at least 1 plot-hole per episode isn't the worst thing a show could do, but its monumental in a 12 episode show considered a masterpiece. This show was meh. There is nothing this show does another hasn't done better.",

            "content": "So if you read my other reviews, a show has to work hard to get beyond my skeptical shell, but Madoka Magica was just one of those shows that did a really good job at subverting my expectations despite said skepticism. There are so few shows that can present a girly outer shell promising action and ridiculous entertainment value, but then actually adding substance through a cautionary tale about getting what you want like Madoka Magica does. It easily slides into the initial guess of protagonist Madoka and Sayaka becoming magical girls into a downward spiral of tragedy and insanity in the face of dealingwith the consequences of one's actions. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously everything in the show is either subverted or subversive in and of itself. As soon as the hopeful, colorful opening theme ends, you're hit with a psychological acid trip accompanied by haunting, epic operatic tracks to accompany the end (of each episode) and the action, and it really does the show well. Said acid trip action sequences are just as haunting, as it plays into the fact that the magical girls in the show are in for much more horror than they bargained for. \\n\\n\r\nThe first part that's important to note that sets the stage for the subversion of everything is the catalyst Kyubey. I won't say how for the sake of spoilers but you find out early in that he's not all he seems, and throughout the course of each episode, you find four very realistic characters being tossed around in a sea of deception; and this is what the show does best. Through his deception, you see a young, naive Madoka and Sayaka learn the consequences of becoming magical girls, and even more so through the past experiences of Mami, Kyoko, and Homura. I'm not saying the show is preachy, but the point behind the show is that you as the viewer are expected to be just as shocked at what happens to the characters in the story as they are. \\n\\n\r\nSo I can't say too much about the show without spoiling anything, but while the show expresses a good story about the consequences of not everything being what it seems, I was disappointed that the towards the end, the climax wasn't a dark mind bender and was instead a happier sequence of events that brought in Donnie Darko-esque time travel elements to fix the evil. That's only a minor gripe, and if you know me you know I don't like happy endings, and if you've seen the show you probably understand where I'm coming from. But you have to see the show to know what I'm talking about so I don't spoil anything. So overall, this was definitely a show that impacted me because of the seductively deceptive nature of it, so if you want something different and more subversive from anime, Madoka Magica can scratch that itch.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What are the consequences of wishes, when should commitment become sacrifice, and when does the end truly begin? Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica focuses on the dark side of a reality where miracles may be fulfilled through mystical contracts. Throughout the story, the protagonists struggle with friendship, the pursuit of happiness, commitment, and sacrifice as they face the dark side of their ambitions. The main characters are well constructed; each possessing unique personalities and differing values. Each protagonist displays signs of development (for better and worse) as the story progresses, although these changes are largely offset by the pacing; which, is relatively slow until the laterarcs, where most of the plot occurs. Basically, too much time is spent introducing characters and establishing setting with an imbalanced amount dedicated to key events.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is consistent overall, although there are several key instances in which the protagonists\u2019 actions are questionable. Granted that erratic behavior is common in stressful situations, several of the protagonists\u2019 key decisions are simply inconsistent with their personalities. The challenges of the protagonists are easy to relate, making the story consistently thought provoking. In life, there is rarely an end: a semblance of resolution is often buried in suffocating despair; with happiness remains uncertainty; we as sentient beings are rarely fulfilled because these decisions are our existence.  Certain audiences may enjoy the translation of these realistic undertones into the story. In my case, I felt unfulfilled; as a number of the protagonists\u2019 mistakes seemed to serve little purpose beyond setting atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nStory (50%) \\n\r\n-Premise: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Depth: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Logical: Neutral (2)\\n\r\n-Pacing: Negative (1)\\n\r\n-Entertainment: Neutral (2)\\n\r\n11/15= 36.66 Points\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (35%) \\n\r\n-Depth: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Development: Neutral (2)\\n\r\n-Unique: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Interactions- Neutral (2)\\n\r\n10/12: 29.16 Points\\n\\n\r\nProduction (15%)\\n\r\n-Art: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Music: Positive (3)\\n\r\n-Effects: Positive (3)\\n\r\n9/9: 15 Points\\n\\n\r\nTotal Score: 81/100\\n",

At the first time, i think the plot was normal from begin till end or this anime was a sailormoon-like, but In one of the episode I realize that it was a looping. For the looping anime, it still keep the consistency for the whole plot. \r\nThe art is very great, I can see the details, such an episode that show Homura browing in internet, the flying sword because Homura stoped the time. \r\nFor the sound, it is very good. We can see from the homura voice, the changes was clearly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters was good. I think homura should be a people in title. But I am still waiting for the reason, why madoka is the main actor. The information that I have now is only, she has a great power when she become a puella magi.\\n\\n\r\nI am enjoying this anime especially for watching episode 10. One factor that I enjoy this anime was an predictable plot that usually has for looping time anime. I can make some possible ending, but, sometimes my prediction was wrong. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was great. I enjoy watching and I recommend to re-watch this anime because there're a lot anime details that very surprising.",

Herein lies the rub.\r\nForgive my vulgarity, but when I first dabbled into the dark magic known as Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica. I fully expected it to be your typical magical moe girl shit, I had assumed those who had rated it so highly were smoking some form of crack cocaine whilst tripping on Lysergic acid diethylamide. I am man enough to admit my faults, and I have seen the error of my ways.Being wrong never felt so good. \\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was so entranced by the gripping story line. Urobuchi took something ordinary (Magical Moe Girls) and took it to a whole another level, an extraordinary feat. Pure Horror, unadulterated violence, visceral gore, and a healthy dose of paranoia exudes the essence of the plot. These are themes not usually found in magical girl genre.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is top notch, a class act. Very reminiscent to another popular anime Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. No complaints from me here. Shaft spares no expense when it comes to animation. And they have the best animators in the industry, just look at the Monogatari series. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack 10/10\\n\\n\r\nInherently amazing, without a blemish. I listen to the (Connect) Madoka OP theme song every time I go to work, and when I come home. It is a ritualistic part of my day. As I absorb the Mozart-esque music into my eardrums. I like to pretend that I am a magical moe girl, defeating the darkness that would consume the universe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nUrobuchi's characters are very dialog driven, much like Quentin Tarantino, most of his movies are dialog and character driven, the plot is almost secondary. The subtleties are all there, a great script and background music can transform an average piece, into legendary, mythical proportions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica taught me is that, to accept all genres, you never know when a serendipitous gem might surface from the ground. Please give this a chance, do it for Madoka!",

            "content": "Some argue that this show is a masterpiece, others argue it is an overrated disappointment. I'm going to admit: I'm leaning towards the former.\r\nThe design of this show is probably one of the most unique things about it. Brightly designed characters in a dark and uncertain setting. This isn't something one sees very often, and it will shock the senses of expectation versus \"reality\". There's just something bizarre about watching a character who looks like Sailor Moon fight something from HP Lovecraft. \r\nAnother stand out quality is the sound. This is some of the best music you will hear in an anime. It drives thecharacter's forward, builds suspense and perfectly fits the situation. It's a mix of pop, electronic and still manages to have a 'grand' quality about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that the pure tragedy of this story is what I remember most. Not the characters, or even the designs (which were memorable), but the story. It's almost a call back to the Greek tragedies, a hero suffering and ultimately defeated due to pure human folly. \\n\\n\r\nI won't reveal exactly what happens, but you figure out something bad is going to happen from the beginning. It's the inevitability that is so heart-breaking. Watching these characters fight against their fate, and wanting them to succeed, even though you know it isn't possible.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch, form your own opinion. But love it or hate it, it's certainly memorable.",

            "content": "When I think of the Magical Girl genre in Anime I think of an innocent light-hearted story about a bunch of young girls using magical powers to fight evil, and that would be as deep as it would go. That's exactly what I thought when I was going into the magical girl Anime 'Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica' but could I have been proven anymore wrong. This anime not only surprised me, but it heavily touched me emotionally, and it takes a lot to do that.\r\nThe animes setting revolves around Magical Girls, who form a contract with this white mysterious creature named Kyubey, where they can askfor any wish imaginable in return for carrying the duties of being a Magical Girl. A Magical Girls job is to hunt down and kill witches, which are formed from as Kyubey put it \"As Magic Girls are born from wishes, witches are born from curses.\" If they were not stopped these witches would otherwise continue to kill and torment innocent people, in the forms of accidents, suicides and other horrible outcomes, since normal people cannot see them, people are none the wiser to their existence. When they are near a witch, the magical girls go into a sick and twisted alternate world called a \u2018labyrinth\u2019 made by the witches, where all the animation style  changes and really creeps you the hell out. Still sounds like an innocent story right, WRONG.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is surprisingly one of the darkest stories I\u2019ve seen, there being twists and tragedies occurring that cannot help but make you feel sick to the stomach, and scenes that will no doubt bring a tear to your eye. The anime centres around Madoka Kaname, an eighth grader of Mitakihara middle school. One day, she had a very magical encounter along with her friend 'Sayaka Miki' where they met Kyubey and the magical girl 'Mami Tomoe' and from there they were shown the life of a Magical Girl. The story contains an unbelievable amount of sadness for a Magical Girl anime, especially the last few episodes of the series where I couldn't help but have watery eyes for most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in the anime are done extremely well, where you feel a connection with all of them as you learn of their trudged pasts and the kind of challenges they really need to go through, the exception being 'Mami Tomoe' which I felt like was a character that didn't really get explored much, and was never really able to connect with the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the anime was absolutely brilliant, when in the normal world the art style is normal, with some high quality visuals for the scenery, great lighting, and great atmosphere. The character designs were top notch, both when they were normal and as magical girls. However when they enter the \u2018labyrinths\u2019 the animation style changes into a unique and crazy style each time. This not only makes the labyrinths seem crazier, but scarier as well, the kind of things you see seem like they came right out of someone\u2019s worst nightmares. Each time it\u2019s slightly different and brings a whole unique feeling to the anime as a whole; as it affects the viewer\u2019s feel of the entire setting of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was an absolute piece of gold, not only was it captivating but it successfully aided the scenes so much more, that it brought entire feelings of emotions with them, from joy to pure sadness. The sound effects used in the anime were outstanding, from the simple sounds of the ambience and such, to the awesome sounds of the magic and fighting sounds that occur, the sound effects are done supremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe only negative I feel this anime had was how it didn\u2019t explore into 'Mami Tomoes\u2019 character, however this doesn\u2019t negatively impact the anime for reasons that I shall not spoil for you. Another thing that some people might find a negative is the fact that from the outside the anime is a giant lie, from the cute and happy intro to the seemingly happy setting in the start, the anime can truly fool those expecting and wanting a happy and joyful anime, because when in the middle of it, this is absolutely not the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the series has one of the most emotionally sad yet happy endings I\u2019ve seen, it truly nails the ability to make me cry every time I see it, and every time I Think about it. However the anime did get a sequel movie, which is really a whole other thing to review, but I will say that the ending for the movie truly destroyed my very soul in a way I wouldn\u2019t think possible, it has THE most heart shattering ending I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was an enormous surprise to me; easily being one I can call a Masterpiece in all ways without the look of such quality on the surface. I personally believe every single person should watch this anime. Whether or not you like Magical Girl animes, this one will be an anime to never forget. A true emotional and heart wrenching experience.  10/10\\n",

I have resisted this show forever, even though it was constantly recommended to me by Netflix and came up in searches for mystery/psychological genres. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (or Puella Magi if it's easier on the eyes) takes a hot sec to gain momentum, but once you finish episode 3, it's liftoff from there. Each episode after that escalates the depth of its characters and both raises and answers questions. \r\nStory - 10\r\nMahou Shoujo is set up relatively simple and theworld that the characters are in are explained quickly in the beginning. Madoka Kanama, a very average 8th grader, grows up with a happy family and has plenty of friends at school. She has a cute little brother, a businesswoman mom who's her best friend, and a househusband dad who cooks. One day, she rescues Kyubey, a cute critter, from a new transfer student at her school, she is thrown into the world of magical girls. Kyubey will grant a single wish to these chosen girls. In return, they must become magical girls and fight witches. Win-win, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime cleverly lulls you into the fantasy you hopelessly expect will happen, and then it peels it away layer by layer. The magical world is seemingly explained very briefly and efficiently in the first 2 episodes, and it seems like a basic premise. However, more information is revealed every episode, and the physical danger of fighting \"witches\" soon seems trivial compared to the true trade-off of the win-win deal the viewer has come to know. What is initially a fantasy about child heroines making wishes turns out to be the world you would expect in reality - no one gets a free miracle. Puella Magi accomplishes through excellent pacing. No scene is wasted, and each episode is densely packed with new findings, important details, and foreshadowing brought on by minute details and day-to-day conversations. Gen Urobuchi is known for making his characters suffer, and the emotional burden dished out in the story would overwhelm any preteen girl, yet at the same time the plot is believable. Urobuchi doesn\u2019t betray his universe. The ending seemed confusing at first, but upon a rewatch, it works for me. \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the event of becoming a magical girl can be seen as a metaphor to real challenges girls must face, and it is no coincidence that the characters are teenage girls. Parallels of this event have been drawn to one losing her virginity (and each character\u2019s respective reaction to that event), marriage, having children, or simply becoming an adult.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I think the show has opportunity for improvement, but it is by no means bad. The characters do carry an incredible amount of symbolism and are diverse in their attitudes. Their color schemes all fit very well. Madoka (pink) is gentle and has the happiest background lives of all the characters on the show. Many consider her to be quite ordinary, since unlike in any conventional series, the protagonist doesn\u2019t just become a magical girl right away \u2013 rather, this is actually used as a plot device, because the actual event of becoming a magical girl is made so much more significant in this anime. Sayaka (blue) draws many parallels to the original Little Mermaid, even down to her fascination with music and perky, rash personality. Mami (yellow) is a believer in justice and doing the right thing, and her bright appearance fits that trope. Kyoko (red) is hot-headed and bloodthirsty but in some ways might be the nicest of them all. Finally, Homura (black) is the one darkened by her lack of hope of correcting a mistake she made. Her character is writing at its finest. Many of her actions and words may seem strange or inexplicable, but viewers will come to understand. Therefore, at the end, it actually makes sense to re-watch the show when you\u2019ve finished after knowing her rationale for her behavior. The most incredible part is that Homura\u2019s abilities and what she uses it for completely parallels the action of re-watching the show from the beginning. Kyubey (white)... well. The whiteness is a reflection of his blank characterization, and that\u2019s pretty much all I can say. The other characters may lack buildup behind their actions, may seem to change their mind quickly, or requires a little push for some viewers to really invest in, Kyubey is a consistently strong character in that he represents a question very relevant to our real society. He... She... It? Values the greater good, which is something any emotional human being would consider important, only Puella Magi flips this idea on its head and show how our emotions can actually be at odds with the optimal outcome for society. It\u2019s up to the viewer to decide what they consider more important, or if the greater good is worth the despair the characters have to face.  \\n\\n\r\nArt & Music \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nWith a decent budget, creative character design, and a futuristic universe, Puella Magi is a cut above many other shows episode 1-12. The flashes of the background scenery and animation of the world, the coloring, the fight scenes \u2013 they\u2019re all great. The pastel colors are very pleasant and contrast with the otherwise ordinary and sometimes monochrome world. However, the \u201cwitch lairs\u201d are animated like a weird LSD trip and it\u2019s masterfully done \u2013 to the point where it earns the show distinction for its quality. While some underlying style is consistent among all of them, every lair is still very uniquely animated in its own theme and different from all the others. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a masterpiece. The soundtrack isn\u2019t as good stand-alone, but the scenes are expertly paired. The opening theme\u2019s [Connect] lyrics are actually relevant to the plot, which just shows how thoroughly this was produced. The show has a few ending themes, but the one most frequently chosen is the sinister-sounding [Magia], which starts playing right after the true nature of the show is exposed at the end of episode 3. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Never before has an anime succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes. From the story to the relationship between the characters, I loved every second of my time watching it.\r\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica puts a very nice spin to the magical girl genre that blew my mind. Before watching, I've heard about it through some of my friends, but hearing about it and actually witnessing the hardships each character goesthrough are two entirely different things. After finishing the last episode, I found myself on the roof of my shed with a cigarette in hand, simply watching the start of a brand new day. It was that powerful for me.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think my once gloomy outlook of life has changed. If anyone reading this hasn't seen this show, I highly suggest watching it this very instant.",

            "content": "I\u2019m going to be\u00a0completely honest in this review. I was quite hesitant and sceptical about watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica purely because magical girls and all that jazz are usually something that I don\u2019t like to watch. But I am pleased to say that when I did go\u00a0ahead to watch this anime, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, though I had seen it floating around for quite some time. The first\u00a0episode past and I was still not convinced on the show but after the second episode was finished, I found myself up to episode 8 just like that and before Iknew it I had completed the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept and storyline is not like what you would expect from a\u00a0\u2018magical girl\u2019 kind of anime. The theme of Madoka Magica is tragic and grievous, depressing and heart-rending. It follows the lives of a middle school girl Madoka Kaname and her friend Sayaka Miki who meet Kyuubey who is a\u00a0\u2018mysterious and friendly\u2019 familiar who can grant the girls any wish they would like. All they have to do is make a contract with him and become a Magical Girl.\u00a0Whilst the idea seems\u00a0intriguing and\u00a0fascinating little do they realise that with that power comes severe and serious\u00a0consequences\u00a0that would change their lives forever. I don\u2019t want to really give the storyline away to those who are yet to see this anime but just know that Puella Magi Madoka Magica is not your light romance/comedy.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThemes: The main themes in this anime are friendship, nothing is for free, and the manipulation of evil.\u00a0\\n\r\nFriendship is key part of this anime as it\u2019s what keep the girls fighting through and battling\u00a0each witch. But the power of\u00a0friendship and\u00a0loyalty is something I noticed occurring repeatedly\u00a0throughout the show eg. Homura looks out for Madoka and protects her as best she can from becoming a Magical Girl.\u00a0\\n\r\nAnother theme is the manipulation of evil. Evil twists deeper and deeper into the storyline, Kyuubey as cute and innocent as he may look is quite deceitful and insidious. Since he cannot understand the values and morals that humans carry, he looks upon them as merely useless shells. The only part worth capturing is their souls which he can then make immortal. The lesson the girls learn and come to realise is that nothing is for free. Wishes may be granted but in turn, making someone else happy will create despair and doom for others. Changing destiny, is something that is not to be messed with, as it can alter and destroy all of what they\u2019ve known. I found the story to be quite engaging, interesting, and twisting the usual spin on \u2018magical girls\u2019 was a surprising and new experience for me to see. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI found the artwork of this series to be very simplistic and different. I can\u2019t say that I was a huge fan of the way the characters were drawn but I did enjoy the futuristic settings and environments in which the story is set in. The houses and schools in this anime seem spacious and ultra modern which makes the school setting different from most anime I have seen. The contrast between light and dark colours portray a statement in the \u2018Good vs Evil kind of way. Though the colour palate can be quite gloomy and dreary at times, the contrast between their world and the characters clothing and colour scheme is something I seemed to have noticed quite a bit. It makes me feel like the characters are trapped in their world and cannot escape it until they fight off the darkness that is suffocating them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The character development was like a journey through an electric storm. Thinking you know what to expect from these characters and then they surprise you with devastating and heart breaking backstories that changed the way I perceived the character. From Kyoko Sakura\u2019s past to Sayaka Miki\u2019s future. Each one is so depressing and some what emotional that it gives a depth into how magic can destroy lives. Through the character of Madoka, I feel like I can relate to how she couldn\u2019t fit in or do anything really extraordinary. She wanted to prove to everyone around her that she could protect others too. Her dejected facade made watching this show interesting because you didn\u2019t know what she was going to do. The characters are each individuals and have their own morals and values of what they believe is right and wrong. I found that the characters in this anime were memorable, my favourite being Kyoko Sakura. Homura Akemi, was the silent badass type which I immediately loved. Sayaka Miki started off alright but gradually disliked her more and more. A character that I absolutely loved was Kyoko Sakura. Her fieriness, her blunt and straight up personality is something that made her stand out in this series. I personally think she is the best character in this series and her backstory is quite tragic and depressing. All the characters take dark and twisted turns, but keeps the story engaging.\\n\\n\r\nSound: In many aspects, the soundtrack I found was perfectly suited for this anime. The opening theme Connect suited the atmosphere of the show quite well. I wouldn\u2019t say it was my favourite opening or that it is one I found very memorable but it provided a nice touch to the series. I found the second ending theme Magia so perfect for this anime. It really captured the emotions and deep aspects of evil and manipulation that is conveyed in show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall I think Puella Magi Madoka was worth watching. Everyone is obviously entitled to their own opinion but I can say that this show isn\u2019t for everyone. I enjoyed the pace of this anime and the overall concept of themes behind it. It left me thinking about just how cruel life can get sometimes and the obstacles we have to face in order to live. I would give this anime a 8/10.",

On my first run, I gave it an 8, but there is just so much hiding in the story that cannot be picked up without knowing the context, which isn't given until later on in the story. I personally adored the papercraft style of the labyrinths, but it may not be for everyone, so that's a personal thing, and others have commented about the hatching on the eyes, which I feel gives the anime a unique charm and makes it stand out a bit more. Hard to say much about it without spoiling, asit is a very tightly woven anime, but it is definitely not your average mahou shoujo, and without a doubt, even people who aren't fans of the genre should give this one a watch for its universal appeal.",

            "content": "Time to dive right into the atypical magic girl anime, Madoka Magika.\r\nPremise is that there's a young girl named Madoka, who's all normal and shit. One day, she comes across a creature named Kyubey being attacked by a girl at Madoka's school named Homura. Madoka soon learns about the Puella Magi, magic girls who are granted one wish from Kyubey at the expense of fighting witches. Kyubey takes great interest in Madoka and asks if she wants to become a magic girl. The story then goes on from there.\r\nStory - 10 \r\n------------\r\nStory may not sound too interesting to some of y'all but there's more toit revealed later on, which ultimately affect Madoka's decision on whether becoming a magic girl or not. It reveals a lot stuff, mainly Kyubey's mission on Earth, why Homura tried attacking him so much, some very tragic stuff involving the formation of witches and some other stuff. Overall, though, the story can get very depressing, which is usually unheard of in a magic girl anime (of course some of y'all may disagree, which is fine, we all have different tastes). I knew what the story was overall way back when since I spoiled it for myself, but I still loved it, especially the very bittersweet (IMO) ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 \\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nI really liked the art style in this one, especially in one aspect. The characters looked appealing enough for me, the scenery was very nice looking (or depressing looking) to me, but the big points go to anything involved with witches. I guess to show how corrupt and crazy these witches are, the art style was made so that the witches' \"mazes\" looked like a bunch of random cut outs mixed into a big collage of just unnerving and very weird imagery. It was trippy, to say the least. Witches also didn't look like the horror style witches I was expecting. Instead, they basically look like something out of Coraline, and if you know what I mean, yeah, it's pretty creepy sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThis was also a big plus for me. The opening intro sounded both light and happy yet also sad in a hidden way for me, and the ending theme was dark yet also kind of badass. The OST also was very good to me. The music was successfully suspenseful to me many times, and also managed to be cheery, albeit, that is rare in this anime lol. Big points go to the more calm, melancholic, and sad pieces from me though. Those really got to me the most. Sound effects were also pretty damn well to me, but really, the music is what I liked the most. Oh, and props to the voice actors as well. I think they did a good job IMO.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nMadoka is obviously the main gal being focused on here, but the other characters also play a big role. Homura looks cold and emotionless at first glance but really, is actually extremely close to Madoka and Madoka herself doesn't even know it. Madoka was pretty standard to me but I thought she was very nice, so I cared for her. There's also a girl named Mami, who I also liked and thought was helpful, although she sadly has something happen to her early on in the show. There's then Kyoko, a girl who you may or may not hate because she first comes in with quite the bitch attitude. I personally liked her, especially for having such a sad backstory. There's also Madoka's friend who I unfortunately can't get the name fully right. I know it starts with an S though, I just don't want to butcher it. She is also a nice gal to me with good intentions but does have quite a downfall as the story goes on. Kyubey, much like Homura, also plays a major role in the show. There are also other peeps but I'm just rounding out the main ones. I give this an 8 though since there wasn't really one character I was very attached to. Don't get me wrong, I like all of them a lot, even Kyubey, but there wasn't one where I was very close to, but ah well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this one. I was nervous to watch this one for a while fearing it would make me way depressed, but despite making me feel down, and almost made me cry a few times, I had a fun time. Those action scenes, the melancholic moments, the hopeful moments, the disturbing moments, and especially that bittersweet ending just all combined in making this a sad yet happy (if that makes sense) anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nOverall, I am so glad I heard of this a while back, and I am so glad I finally got to watch it. The art, sound, and story were mah high points, and the characters also mixed very well into everything for me. It was sad, dark, depressing, creepy, maybe even scary, but also happy, joyful, and I'd say hopeful, especially at the end. I just love that ending so much. Now I gotta go onto the movies, as a way to basically rewatch the show in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like making recommendations since people have different tastes, but I'd say, if you want to try a magic girl anime that is quite different to the norm, or wanna tap into something quite sad and depressing at times, maybe you can try this one out. Either way, you make the call.",

Seriously, it's like we're reliving the times of Elfen Lied and Higurashi (the anime adaption, not the VN\u2014 the VN was pretty good) when everybody thought tragic loli harems with gore were the best animes ever. \r\nIt's not doing anything that other animes haven't already done, and it certainly isn't a \"deconstruction\" of the magical girl genre like everyone makes itout to be. If you want an actual deconstruction, watch Revolutionary Girl Utena. Utena did a much better job at criticizing issues within the shoujo genre, oh, and the creators don't compare their characters to terrorists.\\n\\n\r\n(For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, in an interview Urobuchi compared the girls to Al-Qaeda.)\\n\\n\r\nDark themes aren't something unfamiliar within the magical girl genre. Princess Tutu was dark, Sailor Moon had it's share. Even PRETTY CURE, a mahou shoujo directed at 5 year-old girls, had pretty rad fight scenes. PMMM takes a bunch of elements from Magical Lyrical Nanoha, an anime made by the very same company. \\n\\n\r\nPMMM is just another tragedy with moe girls directed at a male audience (yes, it's directed at a male audience, the creator himself made this pretty clear) so dudes can fantasize about boning helpless woobie lolis. \\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I did enjoy watching it. I just don't think it deserves all the praise it gets.",

            "content": "Title says the most. When I saw the picture of the series, I was like \"rainbows and unicorns and fluffy dolls\". I couldn't be more wrong.\r\nWhat compelled me to watch this show and revise my thoughts was the combination of Aniplex (for great animation), Yuki Kajiura (for wonderful music) and Gen Urobochi (for splendid story). That combination never failed.\r\nAt first, I thought the animation was a bit \"sketchy\" instead of fluid. Aside from the scene before the opening, the animation looks like it's sketched on a notepad. However! It's actually because of a reason in the story, specifically related to the bad guys. When Isee them, I feel a sense of dread and horror like when you descend into madness. A twisted version of wonderland. Kudos to Aniplex.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely wonderful. It always sets the right mood for the right scene, whether it's sad, happy or dreadful, and listening back to the bgms makes me remininsce the scenes. I especially love the music during the ominous versions, when you feel like all hope it drained from you. Yuki Kajiura is probably my favorite musician right now. Oh, and Kalafina's \"Magia\" is going right into my playlist!\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the story. Like I said in the beginning, the cover is absolutely misleading, so are the few first episodes. It was first like a normal Sailor Moon anime where a young girl without confident begins to see wonders of magic and wants to be a part of it. And then BAM! Real world takes over and it only continues to spiral into madness from there on. While how the story progresses is not entirely original, it is rare enough to take you by surprise. There are definitely some sad scenes, though due to me having seen sadder animes, I didn't really feel teary. The only thing I can complain is the ending actually. While it's not what I expected, I found it somewhat lacking, like they just realized they are on the last episode and just had to throw something in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the best series I have ever seen and I recommend it for everyone.",

            "content": "This is easily my favorite anime ever produced. I own a multitude of figures, and the entire manga collection from this anime, and I would be more than happy to explain why I feel this way.\r\nStory: The story to Puella Magi Madoka Magica is beautiful. It starts off slow and confusing, but as you get farther into the show it starts to make more and more sense as to why it started off this way. The story revolves around the concepts of witches, and how those impact different values to our lives. I think the story does a great job entertaining us, while also putsout an absolutely beautiful message that would be hard to disagree with. I would say that my only critique with the story would be that it should be longer, but I feel like the fact that it was 12 episodes long is perfect for how much is fit into each episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this anime is incredibly unique, unlike any other anime ive ever seen. The faces and shadows are drawn differently anything else, and its a little weird at first, and I know people who are put off by it, but once you adjust, I feel it adds a layer of depth to the anime, as the feeling of an anime revolves around its animation. The witches and their lairs are drawn to look alien and out of place. They contrast so hard on the animation of the show, that it creates a beautiful scene within the show. There is so much effort put into making these witch layers look out of place, and you can really tell, they are shocking, disturbing, and bizzare, that instills fear in the viewer, and gives you an insight on how it must feel to the characters to be within their lairs. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound in this show is great, It gets fast paced when the anime gets fast paced, and it gets slow and heart wrenching at times. The ambient cosmic sounds at the end of the show really puts you in a head space of understanding the ending.The Op to this show is also the most notable ive ever heard. It is so memorable, because its such a banger. Also it was a meme for a long period of time, so it has ties to other fassets of my life. Connect is the best anime op ever composed, fight me on it.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The different characters in this show all have different motives, and different ways they got into this anime, they all have a unique backstory. The only character decision I didn't really vibe with was some of the motives Sayaka had, but other than that all the actions and feelings of all the characters are beautifully illustrated, and executed. One of the characters slowly unravels themselves as the show progresses, and as ive said before in story, it adds an unfathomable amount of depth to this already gorgeous show. Each character is unique and sets themselves apart from most other characters of this genre. Kaname Madoka is ridiculously entertaining to follow along on this journey as it all ties together. Plus shes super cute and that's a good chunk of why I love this anime :3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show had me gripped the entire length of my watch, and my multiple re watches of it. Every time the enjoyment of this show stays the same for me, it doesn't seem to get old. If i'm feeling down, this show feels like a comforting friend, reminding me that its okay, and they will always be there for me. The message in this show reminds me to never give up, no matter how hard things get, which honestly, sometimes I need. Madoka has helped me get through some of the darkest periods of my life, which might sound super cringe, but goddammit I love this show so much. Its so inspiring listening to Madoka talk, she makes me want to get out of bed in the morning sometimes. \"If anyone tells me its a mistake to have hope, well then, I'll just tell them their wrong. And Ill keep telling them till they believe, no matter how many times it takes.\" \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: This show makes me feel happy no matter how bad things get and every single component of every second of this show is perfect. \\n",

            "content": "I was hesitant to write this review. While my stance on this series is well known amongst friends and family, I was hesitant to actually step up and make a public statement on the reasons WHY I rate this like I do.\r\nLet us break this down.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story feels like your generic Magical Girl series at the onset. Cute cat-like creature wants to make a contract with one (or more) 'everygirls' in order to have them fight against a grand evil. There is your token main character, her friends that do know about this world of magical girls and those who do not, your typicaldark magical girl, pretty gems that the females use to channel their abilities, the girls occasionally butting heads over how to go after the evil enemy, and this side-lifestyle beginning to show its' negative effect on the main character's normal daily life.\\n\r\nThe similarities slowly drop away from there. Death, which is occasionally addressed in other Mahou Shoujo series, is more then just a kick in the teeth to make the viewer pay attention and give the show a 'raised stakes' feel. Here, Death is treated as the traumatic situation it truly is, especially to a cast of 14-16 year olds. The effects of seeing a fellow companion die weighs heavily on the main cast, and rather then the characters just 'moving on' with their lives, they never do recover. The series analyzes how such an evil can come about, rather then just presenting it as a long-present force that wishes to wipe out the world from behind it's giant chair beneath the earth. It looks at the effects that power gained by strange means has, such as the effect on relationships with others. And these are just some of the topics, all of them weaved cleanly into the story, flowing marvelously. As one situation comes up and is dealt with, another one rises up from the ashes of that, each piece bringing the 'answer' of the previous problem to it's logical conclusion. \\n\r\nIn short, it is a complex plot and story line, but it never gets too deep.\\n\r\n(Note: Despite all of this, I hesitate to call this a deconstruction, as in nature PMMM fits the definition of a Darker and Edgier take on the Magical Girl franchise. Most of those elements which are deconstructed in here have already been done in many other Magical Girl shows, such as Lyrical Nanoha.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhile the original TV airing was a bit on the bland and empty side, you'll typically just end up watching the DVD/Blu-Ray releases of the series, where the animation teams went back and added to the scenes, along with spicing everything up. It shows. The Art is scary when needed, and beautiful when need also. It pulls this off by actually showcasing two different art styles, both being vividly different from the other. Yet on either side of this contrast, everything is literal eye candy. Your eyes will never bore. The foreground is just as pumped as the background with things, but neither is so obtuse that it breaks immersion.\\n\r\nPersonally, I don't worry to much about the artwork and artstyle in a series, as my only real request is that the art reflects the mindset of the main character(s). PMMM does this with flying colors, using two alternate styles of presentation, the first being 'cute' but never feeling quite right, representing the start of the series and the character(s)' mindset, while the later is plain 'wrong' and does a great job showcasing everything that is wrong with the situations it is used in.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the more observant viewer (or the viewer re-watching the series) will notice many things hidden within both styles of artwork. The foreshadowing is cleverly placed in every episode, but it is never so extreme as to give away the entire plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEvery piece of music does the job it is set out to do. If the situation is somber, the music either shuts off completely or sets off to mimic the somber nature. In the middle of the fight scene, the beats are well timed to compliment the flow of the battle, rather it be swift and quick, or harsh and violent. The background noises never clash or take away, only add. The voice acting in both the Japanese and English dubs are marvelous. Many other series have issues with one or the other, but upon rewatching both several times, I will say that both were an example of voice actresses and actors putting their best feet forwards each time they came to the mic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nA good story goes nowhere with a bland cast. A bad story can be salvaged by a good cast. This, however, is a case of a smooth, flowing story being complimented by a well written group of characters, both primary and supporting.\\n\r\nAbove, I made mention as to the flow of the story. This flow is aided by the characters. While the titular character is Madoka Kaname, the focus of the story shifts along with the situation at hand, often using Madoka herself as the tool for the perspective shift, but never neglecting her even when another Magical Girl is the topic.\\n\r\nAll of the cast are also quite active for the majority of the show. The very few times that character(s) do not jump to advance the plot, they have reasons, and the reasons they state are actually reasons that anyone with a more mature mindset wold be able to resonate with. Each magical girl has her own trove of troubled pasts and dark secrets, and even toward the end of the series the cast expands the lore behind them and alongside the world around them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a really subjective section. Those who love tragedy or bittersweetness will likely be roped in quickly. On the other hand, the intense darkness of the series, which overshadows nearly everything else in the final four episodes does clash with the lighter sections of the first few episodes. The transition is smooth and never terribly over dramatic, but the end result of the overall atmosphere could very easily turn off viewers that are more familiar with lighter and softer series such as the Classic Sailor Moon or Pretty Cure. Personally, I would say that due to the smooth transition and emotional investment, the enjoyment and satisfaction of watching and completing this never abates.\\n\r\nWatching a collection of characters interact also adds to the enjoyment. Along the likes of Lyrical Nanoha or Sailor Moon, the primary characters interact with each other in a variety of situations, and they all bounce off of eachother in a natural way. Even if the story itself is a turn off due to the extreme darkness in the closing stages, the characters themselves make it worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\n'Outstanding' is the term used by this site for 10/10 ratings, and I have to fully agree. PMMM does what many other series do, and runs with it without stumbling over any hurdles, major or minor. On the emotional level, intellectual level, and the 'pure-entertainment' level, you will always be interacted with and treated to a wonderful and terrifying work.\\n\r\nPersonally, I can not stop recommending this series to anyone, regardless of their stance on the Magical Girl genre or on Deconstruction/Dark series. And without exception, everyone I have recommend this series to was quickly pulled in, and found the same investment and love for it that I did.",

It was enjoyable enough to keep watching, but at the end I was expecting some kind of grand finale which didn't deliver. Still, I do give them credit for giving a *very* basic explanation for the magic girl phenomenon rather than none at all, like most shows do, but still it lacked in my humble opinion in the two most important departments; storyand characters. Really, the only thing it absolutely excelled in was uniqueness without a too bad story, which for most avid anime fans might be enough reason to love it as much as they do, I guess. Either way, if you need an in depth review, there enough of those on the site, but I just wanted to show a glimpse of the other side of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOh and, as far as the art goes, yeah, sure, it might be totally intentional and totally unique, but that still doesn't make it beautiful or anything.

            "content": "No spoilers.\r\nMadoka Magica is a very surprising series. At first glance it seems like a shallow magical girl straight-to-DVD sort of thing. Even slice of life, at first. While such a thing has it's own merits, it doesn't sound very thrilling on the surface. But Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (hereafter MSMM) isn't famous for what's on the surface. The series will pick you up in the first episode and you won't be able to stop until the final.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nInitially, things seem sort of vague and rushed. You're rather abruptly introduced to some of the fundamental plot elements, which would normally prevent this series from gettinga 10/10 in this category, at least from me. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that it only gets better. I loved everything about this story, and I'd be willing to bet that you will, too.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animators for this series were boldly creative in their representation of the normal world, the warped, lethally bizarre labyrinths that witches inhabit, and the characters. There's a sort of endearing moe motif in the girls, which draws the watcher into caring for them. However, where this series really shines is in the scenery. The represented Japan is futuristic and sterile, in sharp contrast to the maddening, colorful worlds in which the magical girls combat their enemies. The art shift can be jarring, but I think that it's for the best.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMSMM isn't exactly a star example of stunning audio in anime, but this isn't a deal breaker considering the stunning quality of nearly every other aspect of the show. Overall, the OST and dub are average, neither adding to or diminishing the effect of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another area in which MSMM shatters expectations. The majority of magical girl genre characters are, well, just little girls with magic powers. There's not much to them. MSMM takes the trope of the cheery, ever-capable magical girl and smashes it to bits. The characters are complex and their motivations make sense, after a bit of exposition. Again, it's not easy to elaborate on what exactly makes MSMM stand out in the character department without spoiling some major plot points, so unfortunately I can't flesh this category out much more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10 - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMSMM is, surprisingly, one of my top 20 favorite anime, after having watched it. This series is filled to the brim with almost all of my favorite situations and subject matter. As expected of Gen Urobuchi, you're in for it in the emotional department if you decide to watch this show. To anyone looking for feels and stunning characters, this is a show for you.",

Especially amazing was the art direction regarding the Witches and their Labyrinths, and the way it contrasted so much with the rest of the world.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 - The sound kept to a high standard throughout the show - the OP is probably one of my favorite songs from an anime right now. The music played is appropriate for the scene it's shown in, and it always sounds absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 - The characters all had believable backstories, realistic reasons for becoming a Puella Magi, and solid personalities at the time of the show. The character development was executed well, especially in the case of Sayaka and Homura. On the surface, they didn't seem like very relatable characters - how do you relate to a character in this sort of scenario? - but, as we uncover more of the characters' lives and backgrounds, they become more and more easily relatable to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - What can I say? This anime was beautiful in every aspect. Can't wait for the movie!",

            "content": "What defines something as \"Evil\"? Is it being heartlessly cold?? Sacrificing other's lifes without any doubt, to achieve a goal, even if it is worth something?! Yes... and no. \"Evil\" is something that can only exist in the presence of \"Good\", you cant have one without the other. We define something as \"Evil\" because, in the counterpart as human beings, fueled by emotions, we have came to experience and understand the concept of \"Good\"! \r\n Thus without these emotions, neither of the two would exist. We cannot expect to understood a self that doesnt know what emotions are, we may try to, but fully comprehensionwill be impossible to achieve. So for this emotionless self, its actions maybe viewed purely by the logic behind those, so cataloging its evilness, is not correct, neither is it wrong, it is a relative opinion, based on our biological predisposition, the core of what means being human. \\n\r\n We are what we are, we cant avoid it, it is how we work, not something that can be changed.\\n\r\nThose who have already seen the anime, will understand what I m referring to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe story is what drives this anime, the reason why it is so different from other Mahou Shoujos! The easiest example, more for some than others, its unforeseen impact, from all those gruelsome events that the main cast has to surpass. \\n\r\nAll characters in consideration, my 2 favorites are Akemi Homura and Kaname Madoka. \\n\r\nWhile the major flaw of the anime, was being only 12 episodes long, thus the character development can only go so far... still it was very enjoyable to watch the relationship betweem both my favs flesh out. \\n\r\nIt got me teary by the end, but a anime doesnt need to make your shed tears to be that great, so yeah it had various memorable moments.\\n\r\nMiki Sayaka, Sakura Kyouko and Tomoe Mami, out of the 3, not getting into spoilers, each one had its showtime that I much enjoyed, no doubt, but they weren't as developed as the other 2. It is easy to see they weren't the main focus of the anime, but the support.\\n\r\nSpecial mention for Kyuubey, which also added to the anime.\\n\r\nEvery character felt realistic enough, their struggles and decisions felt extremely human to me! The \"villain\" was also a part of what made all this possible, some hate him, I dont. \\n\r\nI just love it all.  \\n\\n\r\nIn all and all, I felt I could have enjoyed it a bit more, maybe because this is still a Mahou Shoujo, and while the characters are well built into the time-frame so short, it still has its limits. \\n\r\n\"I could fancy with these girls still a bit more.\" \\n\r\nBut a 9 is no doubt, a HIGH score, so while it may seem like a big flaw with all this focus, it really is not, it was simply overshadowed by the rest of what made the series so good for me.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story about \"magical girls getting a reality check\", something one wouldn't think to see in the Mahou Shoujo genre, hence it is a descontruction of the genre. \\n\r\nIt is not all that pretty, fancy, happy-go-lucky slice-of-life stuff, the story pushes the characters, that faced with danger and grief won't behave as perfect humans! They aren't flawless by any means. You wont be seeing the typical one-dimensional behavior. \\n\r\nThese characters make mistakes, regret them, learn from it, but that doesnt lead to a \"everything is fine now, another barrier surpassed, lets go find more, and surpass it with the power of friendship!!\"\\n\r\nIf you want, and expect the following to happen, while watching the anime, immediatly get rid of those illusions of yours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThe story is a major point of interest, when one watches a story, \"the story is the river, and the characters are its streamflow\". \\n\\n\r\nEverything starts like anyother typical Mahou Shoujo, the girls meet the contracter, help him out of trouble, in return the contracter proposes them to became magical girls and other magical girls show up, etc, etc... but if you look well, ever since the first episode, from the first minute, its darkness is there! \\n\r\nIt is, lying underneath of the Mahou Shoujo's troupes, you just have to look for it, between the lines. \\n\r\nFrom the very first dream sequence, the music, the art, the atmosphere, look closer, those imply to something more! \\n\\n\r\nBreaking from the molds that defined the genre for so long, indeed not your cliche sunny scripted story, where the episode finishes with the classic, girls defeating the villains, and going all happy to their homes, living and preparing themselves for the next day of \"the rich new cheerful adventures, that awaits them\".\\n\r\nTables will be fliped at a certain moment, sooner in the anime, be prepared for it, there were hints to something more darker. \\n\r\nAnd let me say I had the opportunity to read/watch worst psychological/horror scenarios, than those at this point. I was prepared. \\n\r\nI knew it would came to this, at a certain point in the story... but it still had that effect of \"ohh shit!!, stuff is getting real now\", from there on, it gets darker and darker, as plot twists are revealed, horrendous events unfold, as the harsh bitter truth strucks into their minds, human principles are bent and the characters reach breakdown point, going even further beyond, the perfect day-to-day reality crumbles and shatters to dust.  \\n\r\nAnd thus the fate of being a Magical Girl is revealed! \\n\\n\r\nIs there any hope, a glimpse of light in the future reserved for them? \\n\r\nCan the cycle of despair and loliness of a Mahou Shoujo be ended??\\n\r\nEither way you wont be disappointed, Gen Urobochi the writter (which also wrote Fate/Zero), from a dying genre, he created in 12 episodes a fantastic and clever story! There is no short income of surprises adn twists, in a bold approuch, a fresh breath of genious, better than whatever you could expect in this genre nowadays.\\n\r\nA well crafted plot, far more original, surprising and creative, AND at least as twisted when comparing to its other works.\\n\r\nThe ruthless destiny awaits.\\n\r\nI love how sick the story turned to be, whenever some twisted event took place I was begging for MOAR! More suffer, more great, unpreddictable, writting.\\n\r\nI was glady fulfilled by the end. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Sound: 10\\n\r\nThe characters designs while being good, were nothing sort of breathtaking, and the facial design being widder, was a bit weird at the beggining, but easily I adapted to it. \\n\r\nNothing special so far, so why another 10, you may wonder.\\n\\n\r\nLets start by the dreams sequences, where most of the action happens. \\n\r\nThese are that unique and visually different from the common stuff you find on anime. \\n\r\nEach dream sequence is different, from how the enemies and scenario were drew and the angles used, to the colour palette used, ranging from the brighest colours to the darkest ones, now fused with awesome music like \"Gradus prohibitus\", giving that feel of entering into a dream-like stage,  you are like being draw to the dream, to the atmosphere, in a trance-like-behavior, just like the characters, you just fall deeper, \"following the dangerous light\" that could mark your premature end. \"Credens justitiam\" for some stylish transformations, and others like my 2 favs, \"Sis puella magica!\" or \"Magia\"(the ED true song), for the action scenes that will surprise you in the fluid and creative epicness, it is a blast! \\n\r\nThe dreams sequences ARE a psychedelic experience, I was deeply immersed myself in every second of it.\\n\r\nThe action also happens outside these dream sequences, and it just as epic and flashy, while the scenarios are more mundane. \\n\r\nAnimation, Shaft, I love you even more now!  \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned the awesome soundtrack...this was the aspect of the anime where I was mostly pleasent surprised with, when I started to watch Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\\n\r\nI was already expecting the OP, that didnt told me much at first place.  \\n\r\nI got more meaning from it, by the end of the series (one moment the dark side of Madoka, the destiny, then it follows up with this happy OP song, the contrast was great), thought the first ED reeks, and that won't change. Couldn't care less...\\n\r\nWhen you first face reality, it all ends with a bang followed by the true ED theme, Magia by Kalafina, and I have seen hers others workers, song-wise only, I prefer her's Sprinter more, but how Shaft fused the song with the ED visuals, it became one of the most memorable ED's for me, first on my top! \\n\r\nIt symbolized the reveal in full splendor, of Puella's true nature, the first I seen it... one of the best moments in the anime! \\n\r\nI was expecting the true ED to be more gore-like, less abstracted, when I heard people talk about it. But it wouldnt be as perfect as it is. It pumped my soul, and it still does, everytime I re-watch a episode. \\n\r\nFurther into the void, the unknowed, your life flame burning way, ever more unstable, with each step the determination growns only stronger, which only leads to its self-destruction.\\n\\n\r\n\"The light of love you lit in your eyes one day... transcends time, \\n\r\n and surely destroy one dream... of this world and hurries to its ruin.\\n\r\n  Swallow down your hesitation.\\n\r\n   What is it that you wish for?\\n\r\n    On the path of yearning as greedy as this, \\n\r\n    will there be a good future?\\n\r\n     Like ancient magic... that I dreamed of when I was young,\\n\r\n     with the power to slash the darkness,  \\n\r\n     I want to meet the smiling you.\\n\r\n      In these frightened hands of mine,\\n\r\n      I have the courage of hand-picked flowers.\\n\r\n      My feelings alone are all that I rely upon,\\n\r\n      a wish that awaken... the light.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned I expect more gore before... \\n\r\nRemenbering myself, when I first came in contact with the anime, and people's thoughts about it, I did expect GORE, lots of blood, violence here, girls screaming and dying there, even more than before, when I realised something like Neon Genesis Evangelion was in the reccomendation box! \\n\\n\r\nDunno, I thought there would be some fanservice to people that like gory scenes... I was glady wrong, it seems I forgot this was Shaft! The way they do it, is less visually agressive, but still that impressive, with all those colors, and stuff I dont want to spoil for you folks. \\n\r\nNothing could had fit the nature of Mahou Shoujo Madoka more, than how the fulfilled here! \\n\r\nAnd after reaching the end of this journey, I came to realise, only Shaft could do something like this. \\n\r\nNot really downgrading other studios (they have they strong points too), just the way Shaft has come to animate stuff, it is tricky to explain, but once you see a Shaft animation, you will understand its style, the abstract way to transmite information about the atmosphere and the characters, it is a charm exclusive to Shaft, its trademark.\\n\r\nI have seen better character animations, in terms of fluidity, details and expressiveness, mostly in movies!! That have lots of budget to do so.\\n\r\nThis anime probably didnt had that much budget, but with what it had, it was wisely implemented, because nothing felt awkward for me, the action even surprised me positively, along with the different take on Visuals (Shaft TM), the decisions of how to do stuff, everything felt in, improving further the immersion with one of the best OST's for an anime, EVER. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy first experience with the anime:\\n\r\n\"First 2 episodes completed, ok anime, good OST and animation, this is different from everyother Mahou Shoujo, but I cannot quite get it yet... (progressing further) DAMM, the story is really becoming quite something!\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the anime for the first time, I was confused, yes I did enjoyed it alot, and had already came to a conclusion with what I said above.\\n\r\n\"Interesting till the end, shocking the viewers for the most part!\"\\n\\n\r\nBUT for the enjoyment segment, something was missing, I had to rewatch the anime, to fully grasp my thoughts about it, to clear my mind, put it into words 100 % correct , no exageration or mistake, and here it goes.\\n\\n\r\nColder reality, sweet despair, was never as sweet, sweeter than all those moe cliche mahou shoujos. Am I evil for enjoying it that much?? \\n\r\nI enjoyed the characters and did at some point wanted them to be happy... \\n\r\nSo why?\\n\r\nWhy did I enjoyed the despair the story is built into so much, and so readily accepted such fate??\\n\r\nSimple. I loved the concept that much! \\n\r\nIt still falls onto the Mahou Shoujo genre, but the way it picks on the genre troupes and twists them till you scream, the way it fuses the great animation with godly soundtrack, the twists, the great \"villain\", the atmosphere!\\n\r\nI can't recall the last time I watched a Mahou Shoujo anime, and that is because with the exception of the classics of my childhood days, most of them seem pretty boring, plain, predictable, not as complex, charming and interesting nowadays, when compared with those I remenbered from my childhood. \\n\r\nWith the grown of the mind, I desired for something more convoluted.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Magical Girl genre, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is the answer to my \"Coming of Age\" ideology I have come to adquire in my last 6 years.\\n\r\nThe ray of light, that shines on the genre, and enlights the vast amount of potential yet to be explored, the deconstruction & reinventation of the Mahou Shoujo genre, saved the genre itself from stagnation!\\n\r\nFor such a short anime, great characters, and though it could only go so far in those twelve, the whole originality that the anime breaths of, clicked all the right notes, struck what I wanted for the genre, something that I had not came to release until I came in contact with the anime.\\n\r\nFrom the slow start, to the finishing line, I deeply enjoyed Madoka and Homura life's story. \\n\r\nI deeply enjoyed the ending, and I'm really eager to see the movies, and at the end, the third movie, the sequel.\\n\r\nEnjoyemnt score :10\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is not every come of tea, I can see some type of people not enjoying it as much, either because of its unique style, or the way it approuchs and twists the troupes of the genre itself.\\n\r\nIn the end, considering everything I said, while I dont consider the anime, the best anime ever, it is at the top tier of anime.\\n\r\nSomething I would reccomend everyone to give a try and watch, even you if you will come to hate it, it is that different of the norm, that I think it is worth it to do so. \\n\r\nSadly doing something like this to a genre like that, is not something I expect to see again, it really requires great writing to be achieved...\\n\\n\r\nEvery Mahou Shoujo anime contains LOTS of gem and \"shinning stuff happening\", this is the genre's darkest one, and still, shines brighter than all the other ones lumped together!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9,7 = 10  \\n\\n\\n\r\n    --Don't forget.\\n\r\n      Always, somewhere,\\n\r\n    someone is fighting for you.\\n\r\n   --As long as you remenber her,\\n\r\n                            you are not alone.\\n",

            "content": "So, Madoka Magica, eh? Well, Madoka is a SEEMINGLY lighthearted, girl-ish mahou shoujo show, and normally I wouldn't touch shows like that with a 10 foot pole, as the genre just doesn't appeal to me.\r\nWhat made me watch it? Well the thing that made me watch it a while ago is the anime community simply exploding and praising the hell out of it.. Were they right? YES, YES THEY WERE! \r\nStory: 9-10/10\r\nHere we have the story of Madoka, a normal highschool girl with a normal family,  and OH MY DEAR GAWD NO DECEASED PARENT(S), who meets a strange-looking-animal-thing, Kyuubey, that wants her to signa contract with him and become a magical girl, yay. So far, so good, but as Madoka gets thrown in this unexplored world of magical girls and witches she begins to understand things she has never thought of before. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art of this show is great as it perfectly presents the world you are getting into and from the first moment of episode 1 you know that this show, is in fact NOT your typical mahou shoujo show, thanks to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack deserves a solid 10/10 as it is completely beautiful.  Plus it's done by Yuki Kajiura, whoose soundtracks are always amazing /see Fate/Zero, Kara no Kyoukai,Pandora Hearts and every anime she has ever made the OST for/\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nI can't go explaining everything about the characters in-depth without spoilers, but let me tell you this... YOU WILL REMEMBER SOME OF THOSE CHARACTERS FOR LIFE. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed this show, as it was a nice surprise and I simply wasn't expecting what I saw. So if you are turned-off by the genre and the seemingly cutesy girls anime, then just give this genre-breaking masterpiece a try to change your opinion. \\n\\n\r\ndark_cookie",

            "content": "[Abridged storyline:  Puella Magi Madoka Magica is about a group of young girls who are being persuaded to make a contract with this unusual animal called Kyuubey. Basically, if this contract is made, the girls get their wish fulfilled, and become magical girls for life.]\r\nIf you have an obsession with the \u201cmagical girl\u201d genre, but want something new and different, I highly recommend this anime. \r\nPros: \r\n1)\tThis magical-girl show is filled with tragedy and uniqueness.  It\u2019s not just about girls who are fighting crime, and bringing justice. There is a high amount of depth in this show. It goes away from the rainbowsand butterflies of magic. \\n\r\n2)\tIt\u2019s a combination of various genres. It has a bit of sci-fi, action, drama, magic, etc.\\n\r\n3)\tThough this show only has female main characters, both genders will enjoy it.\\n\r\n4)\tFor a 12 episode series, it answers a lot of questions we are thinking through out the show about the contract, Kyuubey, and the wishes.\\n\r\n5)\tThe ending is bittersweet. The writers did an excellent job of concluding the show even thought it is predictable and pretty unoriginal.\\n\r\n6)\tThe relationship that the main character has with the mom is something that should be done in more anime. We get to hear the wisdom and helpful advice from mother to daughter, and we are able to see why the character is the way she is. I just wish that they showed the other girls parents (where the heck were they?)\\n\r\n7)\tI have yet to do this, but rewatching the show will not kill the enjoyment. The first episode will actually make more sense after you finish the series.\\n\r\n8)\tI did not really focus on the songs when I was watching the anime, but it has been mentioned that even the songs (especially opening theme) starts to make sense when the show is in its final episodes.  It sounds bright and cheerful, but is it really?\\n\r\n9)\tThe artwork was intriguing. The \u201cother realm\u201d, the background, the fighting sequences was done brilliantly. You might not understand it in the beginning, but like everything else in this anime, the pieces of the puzzle seems to come together by the end of the series (might be a turnoff for some).\\n\r\n10)\tThere was character development. You learn more about the characters that you actually want to know more about.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n1)\tI absolutely did not like how the characters were drawn. The eyes, hair, and the facial structures were not my cup of tea. \t\\n\r\n2)\tAlthough the characters had development, the characters role in the story was obvious. They were very irritating in the beginning, because they were the typical archetypes of any anime. \\n\r\n3)\tEven though the first episode might have hooked many people to continue the show, for others (like me), it\u2019s only when we\u2019re half way through the anime (approx. episode 5-6) that we start to fully enjoy it.  \\n\r\n4)\tThough I said this anime does not follow the clich\u00e9\u2019s of the magical theme shows, there are a lot of unoriginal content; I cannot really mention them because it contains spoilers. Some people might not be emotionally invested in this anime because of it. I think the thing that saved this anime was the fact that it did well in its presentation/execution of the storyline. It made up for those unoriginal moments.\\n\\n\r\nThings you may want to know before you watch this show:\\n\r\n1)\tThere is blood and violence.\\n\r\n2)\tThere is little to zero romance.\\n\r\n3)\tThere is nudity by the end of the series (nothing too explicit or detailed). Actually, it's really nothing.\\n\r\n4)\tIt does emphasize on friendship. \\n\r\n5)\tThe storyline is not shallow; it\u2019s not just about happy people.\\n\\n\r\nI have not seen many anime of this genre (I didn\u2019t even bother watching Sailor Moon when I was little), so I could not completely appreciate the originality of this show. Though I enjoyed it, I believe many others who are familiar with the magical theme will applaud it. I would recommend some people to watch it! \\n\r\n\u202612 episodes wouldn't hurt anyone, right?\\n\\n",

The animation and art design is beautiful arranging from a nice vibrant area to crazy fast paced area to a deep and physiological, complex exploration of the witches labyrinth. The sound was great in the Japanese version... the English on the other hand is fine the jap. version is just better. I enjoyed every single second I was watching this Masterpiece of an anime and it left such a great impression on me that I have re-watched it 5 times researchedso much stuff on this anime that I know it like the back of my hand and I cannot recommend this anime enough this is a treat for anime fans everywhere.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut of course NO work of art is completely perfect. So here are the few problems I had with this anime and I will say this before hand they are very small problems that most people would not find distracting in any way and it took me quite a bit of re-viewings to find them now there might be more that I missed even after 5 re-viewings, but that just shows  how small and insignificant these problems  are to your overall enjoyment. 1) The TV version had a few stretches and mishaps in the animation department mostly dealing with the lighting it was a bit to dark to see things BUT they fixed this on the Blu-Ray and DVD version. 2) I cannot spoil the ending I don't even like telling people what this is even about I just want them to go in dry, but at the end of the series there is just a small bit of too much talking to explain a certain plot point.. but its payoff is brilliance. 3) I don't find this a problem as much as others might this is a very complex anime, and some might not be able to understand it but does a good job at explaining what goes on.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nSO overall  Story (10\\10). Art (10/10) Blue-Ray DVD, (9.5\\10) TV broadcast version. Sound (10\\10) Jap. (9\\10) Dub. Characters (10\\10), Enjoyment (10/10), Overall (10\\10),  A defiant MUST WATCH Anime experience that SHOULD be seen blind SO NO SPOILERS HERE!",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is an anime that you are supposed to consider through the character's perspective, alike Elfen Lied. \r\nStory - 8 = The story is admittedly made very minimal. Firstly, there is a switch from the expectation of shoujo style magical girl into the very rare seinen magical girl genre. Second, there are a lot of people who should appear to be role models, only to show that the human heart is fickle and cruel when not being considerate enough. However, I will say that the theme of rivalry and friendship and befriending your enemy is very weak and contrived here and it takes uptoo much time.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest story theme is caution and it is extremely vital here. It is possible to have great power, but it does not really feel like a power at all. This is the most realistic fictional analogy concerning what it takes to grow up because so many adults have power, but they act like they need something more or they put themselves in an endless cycle. This is why Madoka's hope is so vital to add conclusiveness to the world. She is the only true magical girl, even if she is afraid to embrace the magick. However, this is mainly because of how others keep pushing for her to succeed. They remind her not to make a dangerous decision time and time again, like adults in real life do, but she must make the most daring push in order to make for a fulfilling life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the real way toward saving the world and it is masterful that it has been expressed here.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, just this theme makes Madoka high art. While it might not have slow building character and arcs like classic literature is supposed to, but the slow building does not always work and the limited time frame only adds to the story. Additionally, literature focuses on making the characteristics of the world into ideas that deepen your horizon of understanding. Madoka Magica is very successful in that aspect and surpasses classic literature that is too grounded in reality and pessimism based on what is known to actually convey something meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nOne last theme is hope. Many people have died in the belief that a dream can come true. The only thing left is to hope that someone will arrive to adamantly carry the lost flame.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion is that the 4th episode was super scary and the last two episodes were cohesive and artful. Yet, the idea about the history of magical girls feels a bit on the edge for me. Something about it was very poorly executed but I do not recall why.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 = The sci-fi landscape in this anime is incredible! Everything is subdued by the seeming blandness, but the amazingly advanced desks, holograms and such inside of the school give us the idea that there are many cool advances in technology that we never see. The fact that the power is never on in these rooms and such means that a lot of people are probably using all sorts of entertaining technologies. Leaving out the details is what Madoka Magica relies on and the fact that everyone is so sedated and mundane really lends to the need for Madoka's magick.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem like they would be completely cheery, but even the school showcases that things are not at all upbeat and everything feels industrial more than urban. Additionally, it does not feel like we could be looking at Japan. This could be Russia for how different the landscape is. For the sake of fooling us, the school has traditionally Japanese school uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it is always sunset because things generally take place after school. This gives everything a very nice, provocative appearance that allows you to care about friendship and bonds in a different way than the plot does by itself.\\n\\n\r\nWitches are the main artistic area, of course. The witches all look like the background of a Klimt painting. There's also some Andy Warhol elements and probably something else. I did not really like it, but I think that the work was really complicated to do and should not subtract much from the rating. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6 = The opening and ending songs are top-notch, but you will probably only remember one song that plays during the actual anime. Honestly, I did not like that song. However, I feel like there were probably some other decent tracks I did not pay attention to.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is pretty much fine, but a little stale. You have heard these voice actors before and I prefer arguably bad voice actors to those that are too familiar or too cool-sounding. Madoka is a great voice, though. Her mother might be, but I do not remember. She might just have that Rangiku voice actor who does a lot of mother voices.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds used are pretty low. The witches could feel a lot more interesting with better sounds, but they just have distorted voices. Combat pretty much has five sounds at the most. There seemed to be a lack of sound when they were on the highway with many cars, which seems pretty lazy I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7 = The nice thing about the beginning of the show is that the characters already feel a little desperate. Madoka and Sayaka are pretty much clinging to each other for support and Madoka's mother is never home and comes home drunk (rather unique for a mother character). Her mother is really a fleshed out character, but Madoka is dreamy and plain as a Disney princess although showing a tinge of unique personality so small that it might be impossible to pinpoint. But, Madoka is probably one of my favorite characters ever because she makes me feel like I am not the only one. The plot gives her more meaning than most people will want to appreciate or understand. Additionally, she and Sayaka seem to wander in their minds the most. Madoka is special for being the only support-based character despite being the most powerful magical girl. Everyone else in the story is very active, but Madoka is trying to compose herself and keep others more composed and in harmony.\\n\\n\r\nSayaka is pretty much your average tsundere, I guess. She acts tough, but hides a lot under that shell. However, she is pretty unique as a tsundere given that what she hides is being highly envious and poising dangers to herself in order to provide justice to the world. She basically represents your average shounen hero, but is broken down and becomes increasingly neglectful of love and respect.\\n\\n\r\nMami is a character that Sayaka and Madoka treat like a true mother figure. It was very endearing to see a stranger who was willing to focus everything on making a future for the others. Although, it seems like this is somewhat a facade of her personality, just like any kind person. She is a person strongly driven by motive and she is skilled at battling alone but her fault seems to lay in not being able to form strong enough bonds.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko is a nice character. She is very much an urbanite, but she has a past that was very painful. Her father seems to be a representation of offshoot religions like Mormonism or Scientology, but presumably, it was not such a negative religion. Kyouko just adds depth to what a magical girl behaves like, but I really do not remember much about her.\\n\\n\r\nHomura is a very important character who acts cruelly in the beginning. She really excels as a character in that she is a stoic who has a very strong sense of purpose, but she actually is emotionally driven, too. When it comes to Madoka, she puts her wellbeing above everything. She saves Madoka's life many times, but she also represents a deep pessimism, which you might have witnessed from some adults, in telling Madoka that nobody is worth trusting besides her. We are shown her development at the end of the story and it seems logical, but it actually makes her character a bit more artificial while adding a lot more to the themes of the story. Her determination is the world's strongest and reminds me of how I wanted to feel if I had something important to protect (before my life view changed).\\n\\n\r\nBackground characters are essential to adding more to this story and when you see how militaristic and homogenized the students are, the advanced world and its minor characters coalesce to show great disdain for the magick in the world.\\n\\n\r\nOne daring scene is where a worldly criticism is made by a faceless man on the subway or bus. He says, girls are trash and basically deserving of rape and domestic violence and everything. He says that women do not deserve anything because they go out and waste their money on clothes and accessories and such. This is extremely misogynistic and generalized if applied to the world in general, but for some people (like the usual magical girl type) they really do act in superficial ways that can exacerbate financial stability. They do this out of stress from abusive people like the boyfriend. (The blue-haired girl) Sayaka says that they are wrong to say these things because the girl obviously loved him a lot to stay with such a jerk. The important thing is that these apparent criminals might be strapped for both cash and freedom and instead of being helped, their lover is spending money for escapism (which can be applied to more than just women as well). While the man is not a strong person and this is why he mistreats her, he could really have a very stressful life. He is still wrong to do what he does, but we are given a deeper context to a very, very sensitive issue.\\n\\n\r\nKyubey is kind of a boring character, but his design is really good. However, it is fun to see the girls lash out at him.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is the rating only a 7? The characters interact in very artificial ways. The are more customized archetypes and tools for Madoka rather than people who interact with one another. However, I think the message being explained was worth the sacrifice.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 = The battle scenes are a little too fun to watch - I wish I could focus more on emotional content. The aesthetic is really good and the fast pace and focus on central ideas is something enjoyable to me even if it is a reason to dislike the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10!!!",

            "content": "To be honest, I tried to avoid this series at first. It just didn't seem like a series that I would enjoy watching just from looking at the pictures I saw. But I decided to give the first few episodes a chance, and watched them. That turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. \r\nI loved the first few episodes, so I kept watching. From then on, the anime just got better and better, from introducing new characters to showing the tragic backstories of some characters. This anime has a rich story, as well as beautifully made art and animation. Thecharacter design is great as well, as each character has their own story, and their own reason to fight for. I enjoyed every minute of this anime, and it even made me re watch the entire series for the movie, which is something I don't usually do.\\n\\n\r\n I would fully recommend this anime, but I would see why some people would dislike this anime. Some parts of the story has it's moments, and some people may think of it as a bit dark and grim as an anime, but it is all worth it to see just how the entire story is resolved. If you haven't seen any episodes, and you think that it isn't your type of anime just by looking at it, I implore you to just watch at least the first episode, and see what you think after that. It's an anime that deserves to be loved by fans, and I feel like it's the best anime that I've watched this year.",

            "content": "(Edit: Re-watched this, and enjoyed it *considerably* more the second time around. I think perhaps I was already in a dark mood when I first encountered this series, and it negatively impacted my viewing somewhat. Make no mistake, I think this is still an unpleasant series to some degree, but its shocking eagerness to tear apart the magical girl genre from the inside out kept a bitter smirk plastered on my face when it wasn't ripping my heart out. I've kept my original review mostly intact below, because I really don't feel like rewriting it, but I've bumped my score for it from an 8up to a 10. This is truly a great series, and I don't think it'll be long before it's held in the same sort of love/hate esteem that people reserve for deconstructor fleet shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion--though I can assure you that this is probably less-flawed than that particular program.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a tough anime review for me to write, and a tough anime for me to assign a score to. I knew going into it that Madoka Magica was going to be a 'dark' take on the magical girl genre, and I was sort of prepared to hate it just based on that. I'm honestly sick of people equating 'dark' with 'good,' and have been for as long as I can remember. (Star Wars Episode III was praised to the high heavens for its 'darkness.' Am I the only one who thought that it was the worst entry in the prequel trilogy?)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I can safely report that I did not particularly enjoy this anime. Nor did I particularly like it. But I respect its artistry, and am positively in awe of its willingness to mercilessly and logically follow its initial rule-establishing through to its inevitable, bitter (sweet) end. Every episode is a wham episode, without any overt signs of contrivance. I'm not certain that there's an ounce of spare fat in the plot that could be done away with, other than arguably the first two episodes. Still, the first two episodes serve their purpose well--they set the viewer up for a cutsey, nice, slightly post-modern magical girl series before ripping the rug out from underneath you and allowing you to plummet through deeper and deeper horrors. \\n\\n\r\nIt sounds unpleasant--and I'm not going to lie, it sort of is. But it's also brave storytelling, anchored by fairly-well developed characters and a pervading sense of dread and tragedy that actually feels like proper tragedy--not just drama gussied up with heightened emotions and forced sorrow. And yes yes, it subverts this, that, and the other. Because we all dearly love our subverting, here.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Madoka and her friends, and their encounter with Kyubey, a weird cat-thing who tries to get them to become magic girls. Magic girls pay a steep price, hunting 'witches' who torment the general populace and drive individuals to suicide. The up-side to it for the girls, well, in addition to being magic girls, is that Kyubey will grant a wish of theirs. Of course, it's very quickly revealed that not all is as it seems, and things go to hell *very* quickly.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there's that. As for the art--well, the character designs don't do much for me--the ultra cute style never does. Unfortunately it also occasionally looks cheap, on top of that. The witches and the labyrinths, on the other hand... You know what? Just go watch this show. I'm no art major, and I lack the vocabulary necessary to explain to you just how awe-inspiring the art design is when the girls find themselves in a witch's labyrinth, each of which is its own unique place. \\n\\n\r\nOn the whole I'd say this is a series very much worth watching, even if it ultimately may be easier to admire than it is to like.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica was one of those series that I had always heard people talk about, but never really knew anything about it or had any interest in watching it. Now that I've finally gotten around to it, I feel like an idiot for taking so long.\r\nI went into this series knowing without any idea what it was going to be. All I knew was that there were girls who had magic powers and frilly costumes. I assumed it was going to be some cheesy fantasy story--not that I wasn't expecting to like it. Madoka managed to defy every single expectation I had, tothe point that I can only assume that that was exactly what it was aiming for.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to say what made this series so fantastic without spoiling anything, so I'll just talk about this as generally as possible. Every aspect of this series was excellent. I was not expecting a show about magical girls to make me think as much as it did. The art style of the witch labyrinths was so surreal and creepy, definitely making up for the visuals of the normal world which were good but not great. Everything I'm saying right now is stupid because there is a lot more that I want to say but I don't want to spoil this for anyone who hasn't seen it.\\n\\n\r\nMy point being: watch this series. Whether or not the magical girl thing seems like something you're interested in, I can't recommend this strongly enough. Madoka is the only series I have ever felt comfortable giving a perfect 10/10 rating. To be perfectly honest, it's not a genre that I'm particularly interested in, and I'm not sure if I'll ever come back and watch it again. Regardless, I'm glad I watched it. If you like the mahou shoujo genre, watch Madoka. If you don't, watch Madoka anyway.",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, is one of the greatest anime series i have as yet encountered. The plot is simply amazing, the soundtrack is mesmerising, the characters so easy to relate to that it is just phenominal. \r\nBut that's not all, because this series takes everything you ever thought you knew about the magical girl genre and gives it to you, then turns your coach into a rotten pumpkin.\r\nThe theme of this series is desires, dreams and wishes. Not only how we think we want something, but also how far we're willing to go for that wish, what we're willingto do for it, and the consequences behind being given what we want. \\n\\n\r\nKyuubei, the wish-granter, is one of the most chilling characters i have ever met in the world of fantasy. And you end up empathising completely with Madoka and the other girls as their characters are so wonderfully developed within the series. The artwork is a mixture of cute-ish style and just plain wacked (you have to wonder how exactly some of these artists came up with them) and the soundtrack completes the mood so perfectlythat it all ultimately helps create an endearing and heartbreaking anime series. I've actually downloaded the entire soundtrack i thought it was so cool!\\n\\n\r\nThe basic idea is simple; everyone has a desire within their hearts, be it for themselves or another. What this series does is turn the whole concept of this idea and the magical girl genre on its head like you're watching a dark fairytale that you didn't even realise was actually a nightmare until it was too late to turn back.\\n\\n\r\nI fullly recommend this to anybody, because this is not your average run of the mill magical girl series, and it reveals that behind the cutesy-fluff of the genre there is a whole other side to it that no one ever wanted to believe existed. If watching this series doesn't make you shed a tear or get even vaguely watery eyes, then i don't know what will.\\n\\n\r\nA truely enchanting and heartbreaking series that everyone should watch.",

            "content": "Madoka Magica is hardly the first dark Magical Girl series. Before, there was Princess Tutu, and before that was Revolutionary Girl Utena. But I think Madoka Magica can overtake them both in a mere 12 episodes, showing just how painful the life of a magical girl can be. The series could change the Magical Girl genre as a whole.\r\nStudio SHAFT's first original work has proved to be nothing short of a masterpiece and I regret not watching it sooner. Yes, the art has occasionally slipped into \"Meduca Meguca\" style at times, but for the most part it's not noticeable and doesn't take away from theexperience. And of course, there are some truly surreal sequences. It's a Studio SHAFT series. They are required by law to have fans questioning whether or not they were on drugs when they were animating.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic. You just want to reach into the screen and give them hugs. I'd say more about them, but I'd be giving away spoilers, ones that would be best seen for yourself. Make sure you're sitting down, though. This series churns out Wham Episodes like butter.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is a fantastic series that I highly recommend. For those who are skeptical of the Magical Girl genre, I'd suggest watching the first 3 episodes at least. Trust me, it's not nearly as innocent as it looks.",

            "content": "Hello! This is my first review. This is definitely an anime worth watching. Your mind will be blown and you won't regret it at all.\r\nStory: The anime starts off a bit slow, admittedly. It's just getting across the point that Madoka and her friends live a normal life. But after meeting Mami and learning about Magical Girls, things become dark and tragic. At first glance, this seems like a cutsey anime. But it's not. In fact, this anime has one of the most haunting yet beautifully tragic stories ever.\r\nArt: The art is very cutsey. However, one very interesting thing the anime has done is theart they use for witches. It's something I've never seen in anime before. Basically, it isn't drawn--it's some sort of real-looking animation that's totally confusing and creepy and gives off the exact essence it's aiming for. It really adds to the anime in that sense, but if you don't understand why, then it's just awkward.\\n\\n\r\nSound: One of the most beautiful OSTs you will ever hear is Madoka's. The songs alone really tell the story and the tragedy of the anime. I pity anyone who has not heard this beautiful music. Also, \"Connect\" by ClariS is a great opening theme. However, \"Magia\" by Kalafina is kind of painful to listen to. All of the character's voices fit them nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character is unique. Every character has their own story, their own motives and principles, and that's what makes Madoka a great series. When the character's pasts are revealed, your mind will be blown and you'll never be able to look at life the same way again. The characters are truly well-developed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series gets a 9/10 on \"A Review For xx's\" scale. It's definitely an amazing anime, and no matter what, everyone should watch it!\\n\\n\r\nFor a more in depth (and more spoilery) review by us, you can go to our site, \"areviewforxx.blogspot.com.\" We have an \"overall\" anime review for Madoka, as well as episode-by-episode reviews with the same categories above, as well as a special Award Ceremony for Madoka Magica!",

Big time.\r\n'm a guy and from the appearance of this show it should be the kind of thing that would be sheer torture to sit through. The box is very pink looking and it belongs to a sub-genre referred to as \"Magical-Girls\".\r\nThis show should be awful and un-watchable, the sort of thing a guy would run from watching.\r\nNow the reality of this series is that is is genuinely AMAZING. Buy this series, do it now, you will not be sorry. To anyone that enjoys skilful story telling, gorgeous animation and wonderful music, youwill love this. There is intelligence and depth to spare in it's characters and the themes explored here. Almost every episode comes with a \"LOST\" type twist/revelation, though unlike that live-action series when the twists and revelations come they are GENUINE and MEANINGFUL and actually have an emotional resonance with the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe last third of the series becomes awesomely cosmic and mind-bending and the manner in which the story is resolved both happy and bitter-sweet. When you watch the series through a second time (knowing the ending/outcome) you will notice numerous hints and touches layered into the narrative that you didn't catch the first time.\\n\\n\r\nI would tell anyone to watch this ASAP, the only down-side to getting it is that you will no longer be able to knock \"Magical-Girl\" shows any more.",

            "content": "The Magical Girl genre has seen many changes over the decade, the perhaps most well known involving teenage girls transforming into magical superheroines to battle evil, i.e. Sailor Moon, Wedding Peach and the like while some take a turn into the fantasy genre such as the Final Fantasy-like Magic Knight Rayearth. Many of these shows are often filled with cheer while also spreading the message about love and friendship as the colourful band of girls battle evil with the aid of a cute and cuddly mascot character, find romance then go off to meet up for tea and cakes.\r\nHowever in January 2011, an all newanime series surfaced on TV in Japan that and changed Magical Girl anime as we know it. That anime was Puella Magi Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka basically did for the Magical Girl genre what Evangelion did for the mecha genre in that it broke the mold by taking a more darker approach to an already well know genre. The first few episodes start out in the typical cheerfulness of Magical Girl anime, but this is merely a trick to cover up what's to come. After the third episode, the series goes down a much darker path with unsuspecting twists showing that becoming a magical girl is much like a deal with the devil and maitains a foreboding sense of threat. The characters go through so much pain and suffering that you actually feel bad. Even Kyubey, the token magical girl mascot of the show isn't all he seems and has a much more sinister agenda. This is defiantly a whole lot grittier than any Magical Girl anime before it. But this is really what makes it stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka was picked up for a DVD release in the U.S. Valentine's Day 2012 by Aniplex before eventually being released in the U.K. by Manga Entertainment October 29 the same year and was awarded as Neo Magazine's favorite anime of 2012. And it's also become mine.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica is a fresh new take on the Magical Girl genre with it's overall darker tone. Forget about everything you've seen in Sailor Moon, cause Madoka is NOT your typical Magical Girl anime. Watch it!",

            "content": "I started watching this anime when it first premiered, but dropped it after the first episode due to time constraints.  When it finally finished after the huge delay the tsunami caused, there was such a buzz about it I had to try it.  I marathon'ed the whole thing in two days, Easter Weekend, and I was enthralled.\r\nI don't watch much of any Magical Girl anime, but I know enough to know this is a very, very dark take on a lot of the genre's conventions.  The 'good guys' are far from protected by main character armor; don't be surprised to see apparentlymajor characters start dying, and brutally fast.  And when the magical girls fight the 'witches', the evil protagonists they make deals with the creepy-ass 'QB' to battle, the animation turns into a bad acid trip.  I never thought cotton balls with Groucho 'staches could be so terrifying.  And that's just the one they fight in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nIt's often depressing, and the art style is very distinctive (I find myself staring at the cross-shading in the character's pupils a lot of the time), so some people may get turned off by that.  The ending is a bittersweet one and very thematically apropos, not to mention epic as all hell.  I love the character designs, especially Mami-san, the old Magical Girl with the oversized breasts, drill hair, perpetual dopey smile and a huge arsenal of flintlock-style guns.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, for once, a Magical Girl anime that uses absolutely no stock footage!  Hooray for not saving money by playing the exact same transformation sequence every episode.  \\n\\n\r\nI recommend Madoka Magica as highly as I can.  Full 10/10!",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Where do I even begin?\r\nI\u2019ll just start off with putting it out there, that yes. I am a grown ass man. But see, I still need my guilty pleasures in life, one of those being magical girls. What can I say? The dresses and poses are way too cute, and usually magical girl shows include adorable pet sidekicks as well. I love it all, it makes my kokoro go dokidoki.\r\nMadoka Magica is a pristine example of a feel good magical girls show! For one thing, the girls are just absolutely moe up the ass. Also, Madoka Magica sports some of themost beautiful and cute transformations, into some of the prettiest dresses I\u2019ve ever seen! I know its main demographic is for young girls, but I can\u2019t help myself! Madoka Magica is way too cute for me to resist!\\n\\n\r\nOr so you want me to say. Nah man, Madoka Magica is anything but cute. If anything, it\u2019s dank. Really dank. And manly!\\n\\n\r\nI was one of the lucky few who got absolutely trolled the fuck out by this show. It was a beautiful Sunday, and I had just finished watching Angel Beats, meaning I was dying under my tear soaked blankets. I was frantically searching the Internet for a good show to cheer my poor ass up, until I found artwork for Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. I decided to toss away my manliness and believed that cute girls doing cute things was what I needed to climb out of this massive hole. Needless to say, I got rekt harder than TSM at Worlds.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, after finally rewatching Madoka Magica, my manly tears won't stop. Someone, call the ambulance!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Great for all ages, perfect show for the family to enjoy.\\n\r\n- Very strong and respectable role models.\\n\r\n- Probably the most artistic and creative art style in any anime.\\n\r\n- Arguably the best soundtrack in anime!\\n\r\n- Masterful execution of incredibly powerful themes! So many quotable quotes in this show.\\n\r\n- Manliest show ever made.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- As with all shows that use time as a theme, plot holes m8.\\n\r\n- Believe it or not, Madoka Magica isn't the first to do what it did! GASPS!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nI believe I called it dank, and I still hold true to that statement. As stated before, I was effectively trolled by the first couple of episodes. I mean, I could tell that the show wasn't ALL rainbows and butterflies, since witch labyrinths are literally drugs, but I still thought it was going to be a relatively lighthearted adventure. And then...\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica may be the most dark and twisted tale. Well, not exactly THE darkest, but its complete 180 twist from the apparently lighthearted nature in the beginning gave the dark moments a lot of contrast. This huge twist in the beginning is what I believe made Madoka Magica's fucked up story extremely powerful.\\n\\n\r\nMagical Girls are usually symbols of hope, friendship, cute dresses, cute sidekicks, and girly fun adventures full of wishes and dreams. Madoka Magica completely turns these ideas on its head. I believe you call this a de-construction or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nNormally it would be like \"Oh, wishes and dreams can defeat evil, and friendship can win against all odds!\" Madoka Magica says \"Filthy casual, that's what Shounen-tards say! Evil actually spawns from within, and all wishes, no matter how selfless, have selfish and evil intentions within them.\" \\n\\n\r\nLaw of Equivalent exchange is a thing here. If you wish in loads of hope and good, and equal amount of evil will come to balance it out. Wishes never go as smoothly as you think they will. Selflessness is always tailed by selfishness. Good always brings in evil. Whenever there is the best, there will always be the worst. Life isn't fair, ya nerds!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI've never taken drugs in my life, and after watching Madoka Magica, I don't need to, even if I'm curious! I'll just simply search up one of the witch fights on YouTube, and voila! I know what drugs are like.\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica's artwork is absolutely amazing! There is a lot of symbolism, metaphors, all that artistic stuff. It's full of dark imagery, amazing animation, headtilts, quirky yet lovable character designs, headtilts, brilliant depictions of insanity, and headtilts. Madoka Magica truly supports its eerie and messed up atmosphere with its artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nTroll opening OP! It's super fun, lighthearted, and was one of the reasons why I believed the show was going to be a funny and adorable journey! Ey, we even got the troll ED during the first 2 episodes! Wow, this show is really fun!\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, the ED from episode 3 onwards. GG! That song is one of the most creepy and manly songs I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, it's all about the OST and sound effects. Madoka Magica's OST is just breathtakingly beautiful and well written. As a composer myself, I'm hitting myself over the head due to how amateurish my own pieces feel compared to Madoka Magica's soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects, like the artstyle, always seem to fit the mood of a scene incredibly well. During the witch fights, the sound effects, whether it be jingling or laughing, creeps me the hell out man! The voice acting was also borderline perfect! The seiyuus did such an amazing job voicing the emotions of their characters, it really made the show that much more engaging and impactful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe magical girls of Madoka Magica are all incredibly unique from each other, and they were all incredibly lovable (except Sayaka, but even she redeemed herself in more ways than one).\\n\\n\r\nHomiera: Homiera did nothing wrong! She's just doing something that's right, not good. Homiera is an absolute bro! She's willing to go to such lengths for one person. She's the definition of a saint. Homiera is definitely someone I would want as my Homie.\\n\\n\r\nMadopeka: Madopeka is pretty dope. She is such a damn pacifist that even Ghandi would be proud of her. She cries so much, like actually though. How is she not dehydrated yet?? She represents hope, and as you can tell, hope isn't always happy. In this case, hope is always crying. Even Saki Watanabe held it in at times, but Madopeka lets the waterfall continue falling.\\n\\n\r\nSayucka: Sayucka was a bit yucky at first, but she's still a good character. At first, she seemed like one of those lesbian friends, but, SPOILERS, she isn't lesbo!!! Not only is she Sassyaka, since she's so sassy, but she also cares way too much about everything. I guess you can call her the PMS Master. Either way, Sayucka is the one who teaches us that there are always selfish intentions under selfless deeds. There is a huge difference between wanting to save someone and wanting to be someone's savior. Just because you're correct, doesn't mean you're right. Shirou, good job.\\n\\n\r\nMommy: Mommy! Mommy is the reliable senpai who... ends up not being so reliable. She is the one who represents what an actual magical girl should be like! She is selfless for selfless reasons, but due to her righteous ways, she's incredibly lonely. See, no matter how righteous one is, one can't avoid bad things to happen to them.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko Littner: I think this pun is a stretch, since the only thing the two have in common is hair color, but this'll do. Kyouko Littner is the opposite of Mommy! While Mommy is selfless and is the representation of what all good mahou shoujos should be, Kyouko Littner is the representation of what mahou shoujos are like in the world of Madoka Magica. In this world, acting righteous only gets you killed. Kyouko Littner is selfish, with her main goal being survival. She really highlights just how unfair and twisted the world of Madoka Magica really is.\\n\\n\r\nKyubae: Kyubae is bae! Just kidding, he's Satan incarnate, and I think most people will agree with that. Kyubae is the definition of READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS! Although, he takes this even further by not even giving you the entire terms and conditions. Believe it or not, Kyubae isn't evil! He's just an asshole, but he doesn't even know what being an asshole means. In fact, when you think about it, Kyubae is really just thinking long term, and his actions are technically the most righteous of the bunch. He's the embodiment of what it's like to truly be selfless, but as you can see, being 100% selfless isn't exactly viewed as a good thing in this show, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDuring my first viewing, Madoka Magica definitely made me shed a tear. The twist completely got to me, and I was sitting there in awe, especially since I just wanted something to get over Angel Beats.\\n\r\nAnd finally, during my rewatch, I cried rivers upon rivers of tears. This show is definitely something you should watch twice, with different perspectives, in order to get the full experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nCall me over pretentious all you want for liking Madoka Magica so much, but I really think that it's a masterpiece of an anime! In fact, I love it so much, I think I'll watch it with my entire family! After all, my little kid sister would totally love something as happy and rainbow colored as Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Cute girls doing cute things has never been this manly.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is an extended review of Puella Magi Madoka Magica adapted for suitability to MAL from my own personal blog. Therefore this will be a longer review. If you are looking for something that quickly summarises the scores someone has given then you are better looking elsewhere. This is designed to be a detailed breakdown of the show. Anyway, hope you enjoy the read.\r\nMany 12 episode shows that are extremely plot driven go on to disappointment me greatly due to their annoying habit of just skipping forward and missing out far too much. Many magical girls shows tend to lack anything past cute girls prancingaround. Many moe shows end up having next to no solid development of plot and concentrate more on making you go \"Awwwwwww!\". So, Madoka Magica. It's review time!\\n\\n\r\nMadoka Magica follows the story of Madoka herself and her everyday fun adventures as a magical girl. Yeah right. Of course if this really was a generic magical girl show there's no way I'd be here reviewing it because there's no way I'd have watched it in the first place. In contrast though I've watched Madoka Magica not one, not two, but three times. It's difficult for me to give a plot overview because quite simply I'd ruin the show doing so. The initial plot of the show quickly becomes redundant as it develops and we start to get a real feel for its true nature. Now there's something worth talking about.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake. This is a dark narrative show which has some genuinely twisted moments in. To actually label this as a 'magical girl' show is unfair to those who get suckered in watching it under that name. This is the very definition of a psychological thriller. In saying this it's worth noting that whilst this might not actually be a regular magical girl show it sure as hell presents itself as one. Everything from the art style (which I'll speak about in more detail later on), the way it was promoted to the characters themselves, there's very little here that'd tell you that you're about to watch something with even a hint of dark narrative. This is perhaps Madoka Magica's greatest strength. It manages to be so much whilst appearing as so little. It baits you in just so it can punch you in the face. It's a bit backwards in that regard really. It was promoted as a generic magical girl show when it was really a psychological thriller. As a result of this at the time of its release it didn't actually get a huge reception. People simply didn't take in interest in it due to their misunderstanding of the show's reality. Instead Madoka Magica has actually become more renowned in the last couple years where attention from big YouTubers has allowed people to appreciate its real beauty. Oh and if you can't tell already, I really like this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme here is one of risk against reward and the judgment of humans. \"If you had to make one wish that could literally do anything, what would it be?\". These are strong words that Madoka Magica gives you early on as you get your first real taste of the values this show really wants to explore. Making a wish when only given one opportunity is a really difficult decision. What would you do? The obvious path is the fortune one but what repercussions does this have? You can never return to your old life again and is it really money you even want? What about helping out someone you care for? Well, the show itself explores that in a lot of detail so I'll let you see exactly what the consequence of that can be for yourself. What this show does is take a seemingly light-hearted theme and give it a dark, realistic twist. There's a real lesson to be learnt from Madoka Magica. Do you really want what you think you want? Messages of life only appear from truly great shows.\\n\\n\r\nMoving more towards my traditional format of reviewing let's have a look at the characters. It's no surprise that the entire cast pretty much consists of ultra moe magical girls who seek justice and righteousness. Well... except for the ones who don't. The main usage of characters here is that they are all young, eager minds that, due to their naivety, are corrupted by the desire to have something.  Sometimes this came in the form of utter selfishness yet at other times it was complete selflessness. The point though is that regardless of their motives, they all fall to the same trap. This practical use of the characters in order to reflect the overall theme of the show is a real strong point for Madoka Magica. As for the characters themselves I find it difficult to pick out a particular highlight as they're all pretty damn solid in their own right. Their presentation of emotion is done better than a huge majority of anime out there and their designs are cleverly done as they both subvert and conform to the conventions of the magical girls genre. If I really had to pick my favourite characters though I'd have to go with Akemi and Kyouko. I can't go into detail about why I love them (especially Akemi) but basically they have by far the most powerful scenes in the show. Also, Akemi's ability is really cool as not only does it look amazing but it also is very relevant to the over-arching narrative but once again, that's heavy spoiler territory. To summarise though the characters here really are pretty much faultless. There are a couple times where I felt the transitions between them came across as being marginally unnatural feeling but that really is being overly picky. I've had to actively seek out that fault and I heavily doubt any regular viewer would notice it.\\n\\n\r\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica (which is a very elegant name indeed) is a truly gorgeous show. The real strength here is that it manages to look beautiful both during the casual chatting scenes between the girls and the brutal moments. The art style adapts itself wonderfully to suit the occasion with the transition between bright pastel colours and dark moody colours being faultless. This is really emphasised in the fighting scenes later on. What's so magical about it is that the base art style doesn't actually change. The characters are still drew the same no matter the occasion and yet they look suitable at all times. It's also worth giving a special thumbs up for the art style during the witches' labyrinths. It comes across as being mental and mad with a real focus being placed on the craziness of the universe they are in. That's what makes it so perfect though. They reflect the very attitudes of the witches incredibly in a distinctly stand out way. Also don't be put off by the show's appearance, this knows how to do a fight scene. Many shows such as Sword Art Online get special notice for their supposed incredible fighting scenes and great visual effects. Here's the thing though, they aren't all they're cracked up to be. I'm not claiming SAO's fights are bad but rather uncoordinated. Most fights in that series include two people mindlessly throwing a sword at each other until one wins. It lacks intelligence is the best way to describe it. In comparison though Madoka Magica has a real sense of sophistication about it's action scenes. You feel like a lot of time was put into not only the choreography but also the meaning of each attack. Characters fight with a serious passion to get what they want and you never feel like the fighting is done for the sake of it looking cool. If characters in Madoka Magica fight, they have a strong reason to. This reason isn't always admirable or heroic but it isn't supposed to be. At times they fight for completely irrational and selfish reasons and yet all that does is emphasise the naivety of the cast even more. I adore this show's art style and the usage of its art so much that I don't think I can even convey just how much I do in this short review. It really is one of the most artistically brilliant shows out there as far as I'm concerned.\\n\\n\r\nThis opening falls nicely into the 'I have downloaded this onto my iPod' category which basically translates to I love the music in it. As with most of the show's quirks the opening would have you think this is going to be a nice slice of life with some magical girls in. Without repeating myself once again this further reinforces the whole emphasis of the subversion of the genre that Madoka Magica produces. Looking past artistic merit and all that can be just appreciate for a second how great of an opening it is in its own right. Not only is it catchy with some very nice looking art but it also has very light foreshadowing in as well as some strangely placed fan service. Yeah I don't really get that one. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for fan service but that one shot where Madoka is naked with herself and having some kind of self reflection really is weirdly out-placed considering the rest of the show. It says a lot though when you consider that's probably been my biggest criticism of the show up till now.\\n\\n\r\nI don't feel the need to tell you that this show is worth watching because by now that should be very apparent. As genre subversions go Madoka Magica is in a league of its own. It takes the magical girls genre, turns it on its head and then blows it up for good measure. I think this shows gets a lot of praise but unlike many mainstream shows I do not for a second believe it is undeserved. It manages to convey a strong message whilst looking wonderful, portraying a well structured narrative and most importantly no skipping forward all the time to ruin the overall experience. Basically if you want to know how to do a 12 episode series right, look no further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10",

            "content": "Puella Magi Madoka was one of the most talked about shows last season. I initially checked it out because SHAFT (Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Bakemonogatari, Arakawa Under The Bridge) was behind the project. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve constantly enjoyed most of their work and was willing to look into Puella Magi Madoka Magica despite it being a genre I\u2019ve never really enjoyed.\r\nSo what\u2019s there to say about Puella Magi Madoka Magica? A lot apparently. This was a masterfully crafted story that injected new life to a tired genre without completely straying away from it. In a way, Puella Magi Madoka Magica is both a tributeand a deconstruction of the magical girl concept.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show made good use of the 12 episodes it had, they wasted no time and used every episode to progress the story and develop the characters. Every character was important, each one was given sufficient growth and this made the tragic events have a bigger impact on the viewer. With all these important storytelling elements in place accompanied by unique visuals and gorgeous (sometimes heart wrenching) music, Puella Magi Madoka Magica has undoubtedly become one of the most remembered and revered shows of 2011.\\n\\n\r\nI think a lot of people mistakenly compare this to Neon Genesis Evangelion. And honestly? I don\u2019t see a lot of similarities between the two. NGE presented itself as a mecha show that went on to write a completely different genre for itself. Madoka as I stated earlier, is more of a tribute and a deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\nIt has more in common with the grim Now and Then, Here and There delivering a story of hope in the backdrop of a despair-filled setting while still being somewhat loyal to the genre. Another commendable feat of this show is that it doesn\u2019t sacrifice it\u2019s plot for the sake of being different, it doesn\u2019t blame anyone in particular for all the misfortune that\u2019s happened and things still make sense if you think about it and the protagonists hardly act out of character.\\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws, the show doesn\u2019t suffer from any major flaw but it might take some time to get used to the art style. Also, while the show did utilize the time it was given, the concept of entropy remains vague and isn\u2019t exactly given a more concrete explanation. Other than that, Madoka remains to be a solid show I\u2019d recommend to anyone. It now has a place in my all time favorites. Whether or not Madoka will leave a legacy in its wake is something only time can tell. It definitely has the makings of a classic, proving that you can still find a gem in this day and age when anime is saturated with mediocrity.\\n",

            "content": "Madoka Magica... if there was a list of five most hyped anime of the last ten years, this would definitely make it.  Typically I avoid the magical girl genre, its just not my taste, but after seeing Madoka mentioned for the thousandth time in a week I finally relented to my curiosity and watched the short series the day after the last episode aired.  Much to my surprise, it wasn't half bad.  \r\nThe art in this series is heavily stylized, but truly fantastic and bursting with detail.  Given as much anime as i watch the fact that I can clearly rememberscenes months later is a testament to that.  Sound quality is excellent and used to good effect.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters in the series are likable (or unlikable when appropriate), but most are highly cliche and overflowing with girly angst (to be fair, its a feature of the genre).  For the most part they fall neatly into archetypes, but they undergo proper development as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, after the first couple episodes warm the series up Madoka stays enjoyable, though like most anime trying to be different it introduces plot elements that are frankly out of place (the big one is hard to mention without spoiling, but Ill just say that in a story that revolves around magic scientific explanations just aren't necessary).  Pacing is good, and a handful of twists (some which can be seen coming, but don't get tired) keep things fresh.  If you aren't a fan of the genre stick out the first couple episodes, they get progressively better after those. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its one of the better anime in the last couple years and a treat to watch.  Groundbreaking?  No.  Thought provoking?  Slightly.  But its fresh enough and crafted with enough care to rise to the top of a genre that till now felt totally played out.  At 12 episodes its worth a watch for sure, you probably wont regret the four hours you invest.",

I find the art style interesting, if a bit strange at times. The sound is clear and...well...what else can I say about that?\r\nThe characters are dull. I finde I don't know much about them and that makes ithard to become emotionally attached. Without that attachement I find it hard to care about them. I don't even miss Mami because I barely knew her and had no attachment. She was juat like that one episode character you nbever see again. That's the way most of the caharcters feel. The exception would be Sayaka,at least we know a bit about her.\\n\r\nOverall this isen't the worst thing I have seen, but it dosen't live up to the hype either. Most things don't.",

            "content": "Top 5 all-time favorite anime. No question about it.\r\nHow to best talk about this one without making a too long review?...\r\nI'm pretty sure this is an epic piece. Going by what epic actually is.\r\nThe story is so incredibly great yet so simple.\r\nYou probably have already heard how this show seems cuddly at first but turns incredibly dark later. I knew that starting it up, and it didn't ruin anything... It's not a surprise you're being spoiled. I wanna say that even though you know the change in tone will come, it still happens so well and gradually creeps up, that the transition becomes smooth andyet sudden as a guillotine dropping the blade (pun intended).\\n\\n\r\nActually even when it hasn't really set off to become a dark atmosphere, there's a very creepy eerie tone. It's almost like with all the cutesy stuff going on there's always a ghost sitting on everyone's shoulder, staring them down with a malevolent smile. (Insert your \"Soon\" memes here.)\\n\r\nWhat could seriously be a drawback, is all the cutesy stuff maybe seeming out of place, and possibly a bit over the top. But I guess it's possibly what creates the extreme contrast and personally it didn't bother me at all. \\n\r\nThe plot along with the tones and atmosphere thoughout the show takes alot of turns, some more expected than others. Even when the explanation is on the table, there are questions and speculations the viewer can make still.\\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere is really selling itself so well. It's backed up by some really interesting art design choices, with something that could almost look like fabric sewn onto the animation. It makes these creatures and setting look distinctively twisted, and there's never any doubt that it's something unfriendly. \\n\r\nThis art design at times though, also fails and sometimes doesnt blend into the rest of the picture quite like it did in other scenes. I guess what I'm saying is that while it's really great, it doesn't stay consistent all the way.\\n\r\nWhat does stay incredibly consistent though... and this will become unforgettable to anyone who's experienced it. Atleast definitely to anyone who enjoyed this anime immensely. (Just look above)\\n\\n\r\nAnd let it be written in bold letters!\\n\r\nSound- 10/10 \"Outstanding\" ...\\n\r\nYuki Kajiura made something really astonishing here. It's an absolutely amazing soundtrack, and probably my favorite soundtrack yet.\\n\r\nTry and look up \"Credens Justiam\", \"Decretum\" or \"Symposium Magarum\" right now.\\n\r\nThis soundtrack has the right set of emotions for every scene. Each track perfectly fitting, every time.\\n\r\nIt has some of the most cheerful tones and the most tragic. There's a time for everything, as the saying goes... and the timing of the soundtrack is undeniably good.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the soundtrack's example the lincensed songs are up to par.\\n\r\nKalafina's \"Magia\" is just so iconic and grandiose. The song plays fairly early, in a scene that sets the show off to a great start, and which personally gave me shivers. The song becomes the ending credits theme for most of the episodes, while still playing in some scenes now and then. \\n\r\n\"and I'm Home\" by Eri Kitamura and Ai Nonaka. This one comes into the show later and at the perfect time. I'd tell you not to look it up and first hear it in the show. It's a great song and really a favorite of mine.\\n\r\nThe opening song \"Connect\" by Claris is a tricky one. Seems perfectly normal and mundane. While it's good, don't get me wrong, it just seems like a typical anime song. It seems really natural and fitting at first, but the further into the show you get, it just seems more and more unfitting. It's almost great how it becomes \"the odd man out\" you could say. The way that the song like a person oblivious to the change in tone in the show, just further cements the contrast that the changes have made. It's also a nice reminder that there were happier times before despair.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters. Some characters seem to have less development than others. That's mostly supporting acts of course, but this good. Well no, not really... Let me explain.\\n\r\nSome characters that fall off the wayside you genuinely start to miss. And others almost disappearing makes you grow distant to them in a way just like the main characters do. As the main characters spiral ever further into a constricting future, and things that they knew disappear. It feels real and relatable, because us, the viewer, actually experience the same feeling of growing distance to their lives and the characters. We feel their world becoming bleak, the same way as the main characters do.\\n\r\nThis is either smart directing or really lucky coincidence. I can't tell.\\n\r\nThe best character development probably lies with Kyoko and Sayaka. I won't get into too much detail on that, but they go through quite the change.\\n\r\nThe others also have good character development, but those two stand out to me as the cherry on the cake.\\n\\n\r\nTalk about cherries... Many seem to think there's alot of lesbian undertones in the show, and I can honestly see where they get that from... \\n\r\nWell. The problem isn't really that it might be lesbian, but more that it seems like it's there to cater to a certain yuri fetish crowd. It's most of the time harmless though and kinda funny. But there are a couple of moments where it just seems a little much. It's a shame that, those couple of times it is really immersion breaking. One of them is near the ending, which is rough, but thankfully doesn't ruin the ending.\\n\r\nPersonally it didn't bother me much, but I can definitely see why it could be a serious problem to some.\\n\\n\r\nI overall really enjoyed this anime alot. I already feel nostalgic hearing tunes from the soundtrack. Offer me an apple, I'll remember Kyoko.\\n\r\nI can understand one of the big otaku fanbases revolves around this anime, but I really couldn't give a damn. I'm not part of that fanbase, but I really did love this anime. If anything I can see why there would be a diehard fanbase for it, but I don't think it's healthy to go to extremes.\\n\r\nThere is a real sense of magic to this anime (who'd have guessed. No, but really...), and also real sense of despair and hopelessness. I enjoy alot of gothic stuff, and this fits right in there.\\n\r\nThe show captures the feeling of something otherworldly and epic really well, with and intricate plot and great atmosphere. You can question its aesthetic, but think this show relies much more on atmosphere and it has that in spades.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I need to think a bit about whether a show is a top favorite of mine. But like Hellsing Ultimate there was no doubt on this decision\\n\\n\r\nI can't guarrantee it's an anime for everyone, but don't discard it or underestimate it at first glance.\\n\r\nI'd like to give it a perfect 10 out of 10. But keeping realistic and critical I have to keep it a 9. \\n\r\nI definitely love and recommend this show to anyone though.",

It appears to be extremely joyous and happy with puppies frolicking through fields of rainbows and lollipops.\r\nIt's pretty much anything but.\r\nThe anime begins as lighthearted as any other super fruity magical girl anime. Hell, it was almost Winx Club level. But as the anime goes on you delve deeper into an ugly truth yet to be disclosed. It's as if your inner cynical is nagging at you telling you something feels off. It was too cute. It was too happy. That's what makes this animeso special. Madoka no Magica presents an ugly truth as the sugar and gumdrop topping is slowly scraped off. The reality of things behind the magical adventure trope is revealed bit by bit as a horrid yet necessary truth is revealed. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part about that is, that truth isn't a selfish and evil truth with lightning in the background and an organ somewhere. It was realistic, without gumdrops or gummy bears. It's the unfair but necessary mechanic of things that with enough thought, you could see how justified such atrocious actions are. They are necessary, and that's what makes it even more morbid. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I will say that the art style isn't necessarily detailed or advanced.
