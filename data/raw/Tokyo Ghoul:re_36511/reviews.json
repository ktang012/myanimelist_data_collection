            "content": "Tokyo Kushu Re is bad excuse for a sequel. The story starts off as a complete mess, directly jumping into action without any build-up and focusing around characters that have not even been introduced. Somehow the series assumes that it doens't have to put any efford into explaining any of these new things because it's part of already existing franchise.This makes it very hard to actually care about anything that is happening.\r\nSoon after, it becomes clear that our main character has gone thru some trauma and now suffers from amnesia. Great, isn't this just perfectly cliche writing and also a way to turn all thecharacter development seen in season 1 and 2 back to zero. I am not exactly sure what type of author hates their characters so much to go and do something like this. I disliked Kaneki Ken in the beginning of S01, but still came to like him because of his character development. And now I am supposed to see the same shite again? How about no. Alternative version in the same universe would have been a much better idea.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI admit, I was never a big fan of Tokyo Kushu. I did see S01 twice, S02 once and read the manga once, but still this 3rd season is inferior in every way. All the good things were removed, the director was changed and now the OST - which made the first seasons seem better than they actually were, is now garbage, too. Thus far, there has only been one good scene in the whole show in episode 2 and even that was lend from S02. It's very hard to recommend this to anyone. Especially those who liked the original series for its characters should stay far away.",

            "content": "!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!\r\nI'll start off by saying that Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul :Re are two of my favourite manga that I've read and they both hold a significant place in my life. The anime adaptions before :Re had been iffy to say the best, Season 1 of TG whilst not terrible left out a lot of content due to how few episodes they had and Root A was flat out awful.\r\nSo moving onto the anime adaption of :Re I was very apprehensive about how it was going to play out. Would they try and mish mash anime original and manga canon materialagain like they did with Root A or would they ignore Root A and stick to the manga? At the time of these thoughts it wasn't clear on the direction the show would take, thankfully they decided to forget Root A completely and pushed forward with adapting the :Re manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the :Re anime ignores the Root A anime is going to leave a lot of anime only people confused, my advice along with the advice of the creator of TG, go read the original manga chapter 1-143 and then you can watch :Re but perhaps you should read it instead. \\n\\n\r\nHow well have they done? The short answer is not great, worse than season 1 better than Root A. \\n\\n\r\nThe long answer, well buckle in. :Re's biggest problem is its budget. The animation and general art in the show are poor, it is clear that this is the work of people who aren't the best in the business and that are working under time constraints. There is very much a real lack of soul in this anime and I think a lot of that is due to the budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe next major problem for the :Re anime is the pacing. Just like season 1 they've got very few episodes / minutes to tell the story of the first 57 or so chapters of the :Re manga and as manga readers will know :Re starts slow and has a lot of content in those first 50+ chapters. Several episodes adapted 5-6 chapters worth of content the rest around 3-4 chapters per episode. Due to the budget and pacing, a lot of details were left out most notable Haise touching his chin and Fluffy hair Touka. These small details are what made the manga so good. \\n\\n\r\nNow :Re's anime didn't do everything wrong, once again the score has been generally A+ The opening Asphyxia is almost as good as Unravel and the closing isn't too shabby either. As well as the opening / closing tracks there are several other songs the names of which I do not know that are really quite good, especially the song when Haise and Touka meet. \\n\\n\r\nAnother 1+ for the anime is in regards to the VA, there are 1 or 2 that sound odd (Suzuya and Kanae both sound pretty bad imo.) However, the rest of the cast put in a very strong performance and I was very pleased to see some familiar names return to voice characters that had previously voiced in past seasons. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately the anime falls short it was handed a fantastic story on a silver plate and they did it a disservice with how cheaply they made this show. A lot of the focus was put on the fighting which is just a small part of what the manga is and when the animation is as bad as it is in :Re there is nothing to be but to be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the Manga my advice is watch it if you've really got nothing better to do, if you're an anime only well I'm sure you're pretty confused in general about :Re and it's probably best you go and read TG and then  TG:Re if you really want to experience the story as it was intended. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 5.4/10",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul except everything that was good is bad.\r\nAs a fan of the first two seasons I can't see this season as anything other than a massive failure and disappointment.\r\nStory-5\r\nVery tiny spoiler: Haise is Kaneki. Wow this show is boring. I'm not sure that a single interesting thing has happened in 12 episodes. Basically it's just 12 episodes of Haise and his new buddies fighting ghouls. Not a single fight is cool, interesting, or well animated, and not a single character is as good as a character from season one. \r\nOne thing I found so great about the original is that the man-eating ghouls whocouldn't possibly seen as good people were constantly and effectively humanized through the folks at Anteiku.  It presented an incredibly difficult and interesting conflict where ghouls and humans desperately want peace but simply cannot coexist. Kaneki and friends constantly tried to balance peace and protecting their friends and that's part of what made the show great. \\n\r\nWell no more Anteiku. No more of Kaneki's old friends. And no more ghouls that are worth caring about. They're all gone and replaced with Haise's boring crew of half ghoul investigators and a bunch of ghouls who's most interesting and human trait is that they don't want to die.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nSignificantly uglier than the original. The drop in animation quality is actually both astounding and depressing. A show that could be praised for it's stellar animation and dark edgy art has fallen so so low. It's production budget is likely close to half of the original and it shows. Not one fight sequence is cool or impressive and the art can also be incredibly inconsistent at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\nAlso a big step down. The opening is good but not nearly as good as the original. The ending is also fine but kind of weird and not worth adding to any kind of playlist. All the background music is mediocre and totally forgettable. The sound does almost nothing to improve this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-4\\n\r\nThis is actually the worst part of the show. Haise has to be the most boring main character I've seen all season, maybe all year. His only character trait is that he cares about his friends and his current lifestyle. It's essentially impossible to get anything more than that out of his character. Every time he speaks it's something about how much he loves his life or how he doesn't want to be Kaneki again because he loves his life so much right now. I was constantly wanting him to return to being Kaneki against his will because I was so damn tired of Haise's babbling.\\n\\n\r\nNo side character is worth me mentioning with the exception of Urie (half ghoul investigator who works under Haise) who has untapped potential as of now. All the new ghouls are boring. All of Haise's new friends are a bore. They add nothing to the show whatsoever. The biggest internal conflict seen in a side character is \"Damn killing ghouls is kind of sad.\" Really groundbreaking stuff. Massive failure in character writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nObviously I did not enjoy this show and my expectations were shattered. This show has almost no redeeming qualities, and I never once looked forward to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nI don't understand how anyone can watch the all three seasons of Tokyo Ghoul and say that this one stands up to the first two. It's clearly a massively overambitious failure of a project. \\n\r\nI haven't read the manga and I don't plan to. This is a review of the anime only.",

            "content": "This show is a hot mess. It is confusing due to its poor execution of plot; the animation becomes lazy and sloppy after episode 3; the soundtrack was disappointing and did not live up to the high expectations set up by the priors series and what was well developed characters were turned into archetypal and flat characters. After watching this train wreck I didn't even feel anger, as if at that point I was numb to the disappointment. All I could say was \"Well that sucked\". A few day later I have decide to write a review, because I'm just so bitter.\r\nS T O RY 3/10\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re's plot is carefully constructed, into a smart and clever story, leaving you desperately anxious and on the end of your seat as you watch the characters tragic tales overlap...- if only I could say the same for the anime. I was talking about the manga UwU The anime takes all these amazing things aND THROWS THEM OUT THE BLOODY WINDOW. It rushes important events and sometimes even pretends they dont happen. When these important events are ignored future events don't make sense, because they are meant to be a consequence of that past important event????? that you just cut out for no reason???? Also, since this show hadn't adapted the end of the first series, Tokyo ghoul, the whole plot makes no sense, because that is what triggered Tokyo Ghoul:Re to occur in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nA R T 3/10\\n\r\nThis really upsets me to give it such a low score, this is because at the start of the series the animation was pretty solid and nice to look at. However after episode 3 its just crashes right down into the mud. The animation looks lazy, boring, ugly, flat, silly and downright offensive. While most people for some reason praised the art style I thought it was generic and looked like any average low-budget anime. \\n\\n\r\nS O U N D 4/10\\n\r\nThe Tokyo Ghoul anime adaptations are famous for having its surprisingly good soundtracks that truly manipulate the viewer emotions, such as \"Licht Und Schatten\" plus \"Unravel\" from Tokyo Ghoul and \"Glassy Sky\" also with \"On my own\" from Tokyo Ghoul Root A. With the standard set so high you'd naturally expect :Re to be the same. Well... ehhhhh. I Mean, its not bad, its far from bad... but nothing was good. There was no song that made you go like \"Holy crap that is amazing\", it was all forgettable and just meh but with the bar set so high for the music in the TG franchise, \"meh\" isnt good enough. Thus it having a low score of 4, even if it would be forgivable with any other show.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R S 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and left a nasty aftertase. In the Tokyo Ghoul:Re manga, at first these characters still do look bland and generic, but what saves them from staying this way is the amazing and well thought out backstorys and future character development. Annoyingly, the anime fails again to make a solid stride and doesn't give any of these characters the proper stoplight they deserve. Apart from Haise and Urie all of the developments and backstories are rushed. Instead of them spending a good episode length on the development (like I think they should be) some of them are mushed into a dreadful 5 minutes. I think that Urie's execution and portrayal of his personality traits, inner monologue and backstory were wonderfully done; so was Haise's. If only I could say the same for the rest of the cast, then it would have a much higher score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nE N J O Y M E N T + O V E R A L L 1/10\\n\r\nI think that what annoys me so much is the potential this show has, this show could be truly amazing if it wanted to be, it has the right material to do so. Unfortunately the studio behind it is too lazy to care and just wants to squeeze as much as the can get from the manga, instead of treasuring it and understanding how to correctly adapt the work. I have to be extremely harsh on this series because believe it or not; I WANT IT TO DO WELL!! So when it doesn't I'm going to be very mad. I do not recommend this show to anyone, even if your an anime only just don't bother because the show wont make sense anyway and you'll just be confused. If you're a manga reader while it is nice to hear the characters voices and see the fights moving I still don't advise it, as it just is painfully frustrating to watch. Overall I have to give it a 1... Thank you for reading my review ( \u2022\u2304\u2022 \u0942 )\u2727",

            "content": "Note: This is a review coming from an anime only viewer.\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re is one heck of a series. From the start, you are taken on the world of Sasaki Haise, and the Quinx squad. The story, at the beginning, was quite confusing, having no context about the actual series at all. However, the pieces start to fall in much later, and the story gets more in depth than before.\r\nThe story in here is really good, with a complex and unique story which surprisingly shocks me at some points, and makes me laugh at other points. I definitely didn't expect to cry in this, but Iwould be lying if I didn't cry at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was alright. I mean, the animation and the styling done in :re doesn't match up to images of the manga that I've seen, which looks a lot better than this, but then again, the first two seasons were just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and the choice of really different sounds was something that really felt right. It's not the typical soundtrack that most people are accustomed to; it's different, dark, unpredictable and very suited to the story of :re.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation here is another good point. The contrast of Kaneki and Sasaki is quite striking, and really well done. The Quinx squad all have their unique quirks, and I especially love how they managed to put a different spin on the characters than what I've typically seen. The characters that were also present in the original series have clearly changed, bringing the story and characters to a different level than what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was something I thought was alright. The series was definitely made for manga readers, and for a person like me who hasn't read past the two chapter of the original, I definitely couldn't enjoy it due to my lack of context. I think that if I knew the context better, and knew what really happened instead of what we got in Root A, then I would have definitely enjoyed it more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is a wonderful work, and was something I didn't expect that I would like as much as I thought. Although I'm an anime only water, this has definitely incentivised me into reading the manga, and after watching the final episode, it makes me really look forward to season 2 of :re.",

            "content": "For me as a long-term Tokyo Ghoul fan, the newest anime adaptation does little to redeem the troubled state the Tokyo Ghoul franchise, as a whole, is currently in. \r\nTokyo Ghoul :re starts out strong, even if not as outstanding as the original. There's (still) the man-eating species known as \"ghouls\" terrorizing modern Tokyo. There's (still) the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG), a complex, very police-like organization tasked with protecting the populace from this menace. The job of a CCG investigator is hard: identifying a ghoul is only half the story, since ghouls will resist with superhuman abilities; prominently \"kagune\", predatory tentacle-like appendages. \r\nWhile theoriginal Tokyo Ghoul focussed on a group of \"pacifistic\" ghouls in hideout from merciless capture and extinction, the narrative focus of :re shifts, at first, to the CCG. We're introduced to a colorful palette of completely new investigators. There's timid outsider Mutsuki, likable simpleton Suzuki, lazy nerd Saiko (the only girl in the squad ... or is she?) and resentful careerist Urie. Our main character also appears in this underperforming CCG squad, as enthusiastic but ultimately unfit leader Haise Sasaki. \\n\\n\r\nGradually, the one-dimensional ghouls-vs-investigators massacres will make place for a twisted, unpredictable narrative. Since Haise Sasaki isn't just a mediocre investigator: figures from his past will resurface -- and they're not only investigators-gone-missing from the first part, but also ghouls with a game-changing agenda. \\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the namesake for the sequel is cafe :re, where old acquaintances are waiting for Haise to make his move. \"re\" may also reference to the one-eyed king: the legendary ghoul-human hybrid that will put an end to the dramatic inter-species war: but how? And what are the brutal ghouls of Aogiri, the human (?) elites of the CCG, the enigmatic V and the psychopathic Clowns up to? We'll find out, but as Kaneki from the original Tokyo Ghoul warned us: this story will become a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like a fantastic anime? Well, it certainly could've been. If (!) the anime was well-produced and, more importantly, if (!) the source material (manga) had kept its shit together. My disappointment could not have been greater, as neither has proven to be true.\\n\\n\r\nThe :re anime repeats the exact mistake of previous Tokyo Ghoul adaptations, by running through at a breakneck pace, which doesn't let story or characters breathe. The mostly great character designs from the manga haven't been built and improved upon in the anime; instead, they have been colored in a rather flat and predictable fashion, as far as I can tell. \\n\\n\r\nYet, these minor complaints actually pale in comparison to my actual complaint: it's not about the anime-specific adaptation issues, as I may need more episodes to properly evaluate these. My actual complaints are about the source material, the Tokyo Ghoul :re manga series, whose deep flaws a middling anime adaption will only exacerbate. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the original manga series used to have it all: a flashy and well-executed concept of man-eating humans, iconic art direction with memorable and unique character designs, an engaging story with a multitude factions and facets, fascinating characters, tense edgy atmosphere, references to highbrow literature done right, and, last but not least, gory over-the-top action.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these perks placed the original Tokyo Ghoul manga far, far above yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). Now, straight to the issue: what the sequel to the brilliant original, Tokyo Ghoul :re, turned out to be, is ... yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). \\n\\n\r\n:re, currently amassing 170 or so chapters, managed to stay good for about 60, decent for about 90 and tolerable with a grain of salt for about 120 chapters. With infuriating rigor, Ishida Sui murders his story and forcefully drags its mutilated corpse so far away from the original direction that leaving it to fan-fiction aficionados may have been a kinder fate for this once great series.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with needless and anti-climactic deaths of his very best characters, Ishida proceeds to rush through long-awaited plot developments in the least satisfying way imaginable. Equally disappointing, populist and banal climaxes to formerly subtly blossoming romantic and personal relationships follow. What's left is a pointless and directionless exercise in continuing for the sake of continuation, as long as sales numbers permit.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the bumpy path to ruin, we will be served city-sized monsters and banal melodrama as surrogates for psychologically compelling writing. Formerly interesting female heroines will be reduced to subservient breeding cattle, in \"best\" shonen traditions. \\n\\n\r\nSound power balances will be abandoned; battles will be decided by kicks to the groin. In the increasingly rare case a confrontation becomes interesting, it HAS to end offscreen, lest this manga might become interesting again. Death flags will be ceremonially displayed in lame cliffhangers, but no one ACTUALLY dies in this manga. Unless it's an interesting and well-written character: then, its either offscreen butchering or poorly motivated suicide for ya. \\n\\n\r\nAt his worst, the main antagonist acknowledges he had no idea what he had been doing the last 60 chapters. Well, neither does the reader. The authors' self-awareness seems to slip through, as he ends his worst chapter so far with the line \"Stop. Just stop.\" \\n\\n\r\nI'm not exaggerating. Read the manga. Or, rather -- don't. It's a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nSuper peace.\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\n0/10, Unfortunately a huge let down, an almost exact repeat of the mistakes made before, this anime is both an unusually bad adaption, sequel, and has been vastly overhyped.\r\n- Characters: 0/10 - Does what Tokyo ghoul does best, it ignores interesting characters, and instead focuses on the subpar, uninteresting ones. After establishing a bland and unchanging cast from the first series, this pointless sequel throws them all under a bus and replaces them with insert generic copy and paste characters here. This now includes the protagonist, the author waited until this sequel to reset him with a deux ex memory loss to retcon hisdevelopment. Also with Nishio, he does get to come back but Re resets him too so, surprise, surprise he\u2019s right back to what he was doing before. \\n\r\nSimilarly, Touka was the most popular character in popularity contests in the first manga, so naturally she had to be demoted to a side character here (remember Tokyo ghoul\u2019s claim to infamy is that it identifies the good members of the cast fans like, and purposely boots them to the curb in favour of second rate, extra inferior characters. This fails in terms of concept, an audience would want to see cool and great characters, not insert wooden acting person or ghoul here, character wise it chose the wrong path to walk). \\n\r\nRegarding Touka, the female lead, even though Kaneki at first fancied Rize, and didn\u2019t give Touka the time of day, Tokyo Ghoul is somehow convinced that Kaneki would fall madly in love with the most trite, insipid person on the market. It\u2019s because she was supposed to have her Emo black hair for Kaneki to fall head over heels in love with, so they can have a Marilyn Manson themed romance later. In a dire attempt to introduce a tender moment (Kidding you not, Touka is waiting for Kaneki to regain his memories/cut Kaneki right out her life, perfectly content with moving on without him, \u201ctwo years later my life\u2019s fine without you, seen you again, you mean nothing to me.\u201d) It brings to mind the \u2018Twilight\u2019 comparisons, just bizarre, mismatched and wholly unconvincing attempts at romance with clumsy plastic characters, and it doesn\u2019t work, unless it\u2019s an Emo\u2019s unite (spoiler, it is) series, funny that should be mentioned.\\n\r\nIdentically, Amon, the only one with some sense, a capable fighter and strategist has disappeared, again because he was a good character and, don\u2019t forget, Tokyo Ghoul can only focus on the third rate, especially dull characters, all eyes on you Quinx squad.\\n\r\nThe added problem with this is the author already tried this by establishing the bad characters as the focal point in the first series. The animation studio made them worse than they were on paper, route \u221aA spiral dived further underground. Now Re is out with a vengeance of a retcon, even direr characters to revolve around in the form of everyone, with the occasional call back to the least inspired props from before. It\u2019s like some kind of aggressive belly flop to the bottom in making the poorest excuses for characters as possible, quite impressive in hindsight. \u201cInteresting characters, and character development? What are those?\u201d \u2013 author of Tokyo Ghoul Re, clearly. Not to be out manoeuvred the studio leaped on the bandwagon: \u201cNice looking, well drawn, emotive animated characters with good voices? Does not compute\u201d \u2013 the studio\u2019s apparent view.\\n\\n\r\nThe other result of this is that Tokyo Ghouls main niche audience, the Emo \u201cmy life is such a black abyss\u201d crowd have also been rejected and forgotten, by the author himself no less. I think the creator was like \u201cit\u2019s ok! In Re the Emo\u2019s are gone! Even Juuzou\u2019s had his body modifications toned down, look! Normal, \u2018cool\u2019 people now!\u201d Disrespectful towards fans who come to this series for a certain validation (\u201cmy mom told me to do my homework, but I want to grow my fringe all over my face, I can totally relate to Tokyo Ghoul\u201d) not to mention it remains unacceptable for anime fans that want to see something promising, and this reset couldn\u2019t even provide it when it had the chance to attempt it. \\n\r\nCharacters, with good, bad, in between traits, whatever quirks they have, are vital to a great story; Tokyo Ghoul Re characters don\u2019t warrant a second glance. To fail to create anyone likeable, or unlikable in a series that is supposed to flesh out the backgrounds of even minor players, there is something fundamentally unsound with the premise. The anime couldn\u2019t even bring them to life with voice acting, expressions, or anything. How on earth an anime can be created where you don\u2019t like a least one character and want to follow their story, hear their voice, see their expressions and who they are, I\u2019ll never know, but Re has achieved that. \\n\r\nIgnoring popular characters to focus on ones with even less likeability, and having no complex development in quite a harsh world that should draw something, anything out doesn\u2019t work for a reason. It is not needed, or courageous for Tokyo Ghoul to play a necessary evil and remind manga and anime creators that sketchy characters and menial plot routes make for a subpar anime, everyone already knows.\\n\r\nThe repercussions of this, and the greater failure, is that the audience will find it challenging to become invested in a story. It\u2019s more like looking at playing cards: that\u2019s not Kaneki, that\u2019s chew toy number one, there\u2019s wall flower whoever, indeed Hide, not the best friend, rather the plot device is also missing. Whether it\u2019s Hide, Rize, guy Mado, even a comatose Shinohara, whoever it is, the golden rule of this series is to stamp out the good characters, Tokyo Ghoul always makes that clear. \\n\\n\r\n- Story: what story?/10 - Decided to reset the previous Tokyo Ghoul and voila, here\u2019s some detective, whatever the heck is going on with this plot (genre wise its a reminder of a show called \u2018Descendants of Darkness\u2019 which was effective in the sense that it done what Re is trying to do here but done it a lot better. That Re came out some time after but hasn\u2019t added anything new to this genre is discouraging). \\n\r\nRe\u2019s animation couldn\u2019t do anything for the clich\u00e9d and monotonous arcs, no need to describe the failures of the story in detail, but spoiler alert, Re is just essentially the same as the first manga. It just shows the human detective viewpoint, with the added bonus of missing good characters, the Emo\u2019s have been white washed removed, and there is a clich\u00e9 crime watch plot this time, in lieu of the fractured nonsensical one the first time round.\\n\r\nThe audience (especially those who haven\u2019t read the manga) may not know what is going on with the story, and it\u2019s not hard to acknowledge; you don\u2019t actually need to care. This brief advert for the manga has too much material condensed in far too few episodes, and complicated further when there\u2019s a fundamental detachment between the audience and this series. What does the casual viewer want to see? A bargain bucket police academy? What do the fans want? An anime where significant material has been scrapped, and a supposed seinan manga crammed into this? Have I missed something?\\n\r\nThat so many manga chapters are condensed into a 12 episode series was, quite frankly shocking to learn, and really sets the bar for the failures to come. Couldn\u2019t even give some nice text or sentences worth listening to in this rock bottom adaption. The only suspicion is that Re was made with the express intention of being bad on purpose to big up other series, imagine: a studio could point to their other anime and say, \u201clook doesn\u2019t this look good in comparison to Tokyo Ghoul?\" Suppose it\u2019s a shrewd business manoeuvre, it\u2019s not like Tokyo Ghoul has any artistic integrity to preserve or risk losing at any rate.\\n\\n\r\n- Animation: 4.5/10 \u2013 objectively and technically speaking near average, not bad but not great either. But just not good enough especially considering other anime titles that will be commanding people\u2019s attention. My Hero Academia continues to knock the ball out of the park, and who else is very keenly aware that Tokyo Ghoul is trying to ride on the success of Attack on Titan. Tokyo Ghoul can\u2019t even claim to be a good filler anime until the time comes for fans of this genre, try being a good animation and build your own success by being a great series, free advice. \\n\r\nCertain chapters of the manga are drawn reasonably well and you would have thought the anime would reflect this, or make up for the not so great parts, but major spoiler alert: you thought wrong. Just to maim the manga even more, and also ensure that the studio has matured and tried to edit out the Emo feel of, like the whole cast, they even had Touka\u2019s haired dyed purple, not manga Goth black hair, \u201csee! See! It\u2019s OK for normal people to watch now!\u201d Says the studio, undoubtedly.\\n\r\nThe animation needed to be optimal for this reboot considering the dive off the deep end the second season (route A, which is now officially irrelevant with Re, which still can\u2019t clear up that travesty though) was, you would have thought the studio would really up their game with the animation to try and claw something back. Unfortunately, it\u2019s clear that the good folks were like \u201coh its Tokyo Ghoul, here\u2019s some basic stuff those weebs enjoy, they\u2019ll lap up anything.\u201d I do feel sorry for the fans, though it\u2019s telling what the studio really thinks of Tokyo Ghoul when the environments and backgrounds are\u2026 just why, what wicked, unforgivable actions have people done to deserve this?! The Twilight/Tokyo ghoul fans deserve sympathy for them having their hopes built up and presented with this, and especially with a Spring time anime this should be top notch regardless of what it is. In hindsight, it's perfectly feasible that the creators are in fact cats, who thought they were doing good and were expecting some praise when they came in with a horribly mangled mouse/Tokyo Ghoul animation. \\n\\n\r\n- Sound: don\u2019t even waste a rating/10 - sub fails to give emotions, anything at all to what should be an illustrative cast, as for the dub\u2026 just don\u2019t, got to spare you, it\u2019s too late for me, I\u2019m gone, save yourselves.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite obnoxious considering the Emo/Gothic niche that Tokyo ghoul is supposed to lay claim is now gone. The sound track could have been a great glue to cement that semi-unique status, the voice acting too. Honestly, it\u2019s not certain how they could have got it so\u2026 wrong, but lets be self aware here and realise Re is a \u201coh splat, there you go Tokyo Ghouls all done for now, time to move on to the next project, what do I care about this series.\u201d Not exactly reassuring, even for people who have moved on from this series but came back hoping there was something salvageable (I did want there to be something salvageable, I really did). \\n\r\nThey couldn\u2019t even have another cheese ball of an opening song. Whilst it\u2019s ridiculous, the male version of Twilight fans were all over the \u2018unravel\u2019 titular song from before, it reminds them of the dark times when their parents told them they have to stop dying their hair black and tidy their rooms, and they were the edgiest people alive, just ask them. But the songs here have failed to encapsulate the supposed atmosphere of Tokyo ghoul, and sound wise there\u2019s nothing notable to enjoy or remember. \\n\r\nA wasted opportunity in that sense, could have had music to match the tone of the series, but it is apparent this is a part of the white washing exercise to remove all traces of what fans liked from the start (must not forget the only golden rule of Tokyo Ghoul, the fans like something? It\u2019s removed; this evidently applied not just to the story courses and characters, but has carried over to even the music as well). It was a bit suspect but it\u2019s obvious now, we aren\u2019t imagining things, and perhaps the writer and studio really do loathe the fans, let go of the hate people, treat your fans right, they\u2019re the ones propping up this explosive train wreck of a show.\\n\\n\r\n- Homophobic undertones - (addressed) To its credit the glaring read between the lines prejudice articulated in the first manga have been acknowledged. It\u2019s clear that the following conversation took place between the publisher and author. Publisher: \u201cdude the whole Tsukiyama, Yamori, Nico, Souta ghoul villain thing is not subtle at all, son, people don\u2019t use the magical N-word man, or the coin grabbing greedy Jew, or the homosexual stereotypes any more, they weren\u2019t right then and they\u2019re not right now. And the whole ghoul culture as an allegory for LGBT culture, with those yucky ghouls/gays out to prey on one another, who don\u2019t have feelings for one another, who view each other as pieces of meat and only approach human/straight people to eat them/come onto them, someone will notice!\u201d And then the author, after he had stopped frothing at the mouth, nevertheless continued to chug beakers of mercury and proudly proclaimed: \u201cbut Tokyo Ghoul is perfect! In the first manga we had Kaneki catching the ghoul/gay disease AIDS from a blood transfusion! He doesn\u2019t have bad AIDS so it\u2019s cool right?\" The author is a machine, nothing stops this train. \\n\r\n\"And then! He goes over to see Tsukiyama for whatever purpose those gays/ghouls invite guys over for, (even showering before! I wonder what was going to happen?!) With the intention of having him torn apart for fun, and only spared because \u2018that guy\u2019 Tsukiyama wanted him for himself! After which Kaneki faints and wakes up on the sofa by himself, whatever occurred when he was unconscious and Tsukiyama was with him? What impression do you get?! What do you think I\u2019m trying to tell you?!\u201d Is or is not quite possibly the thoughts the author wants us to have.\\n\r\nThe author guides us through: \u201cTokyo Ghoul also explores Nishio struggling with his homosexual/ghoul desires but he rejects those foul urges and stayed with his girlfriend, a lady!\u201d The editor, or someone who wasn\u2019t totally clueless chimes in with \u201cthis is what happens when you don\u2019t take your meds! We get it! Tsukiyama and especially Nico were made with the express intention of prodding our vulnerable audience to react with \u201cyuck the horrible gays!\u201d and the writer, giddy with excitement demonstrates how subtle he is \u201cright! So after every arc being centrally themed around homosexuality (catching the gay/ghoul disease, Nishio inviting Kaneki and Hide, two guys back to his place where he makes his move when they\u2019re on their own, you know? Then predatory gay Tsukiyama who just loves the smell of Kaneki, and wants to cannibalize him, just like ghouls/gays just look at you and want to be around you for whatever.\" \\n\r\nRe continues in the same vein thought wise, this was after setting a foundation that Kaneki and the ghouls/gays can deny their carnal urges by drinking coffee, and resist their inner desires by being happily together with a member of the opposite sex, even when there\u2019s little compatibility between them (Nishio and his girlfriend, Kaneki and Touka, Akira is literally thrown at Amon). \\n\r\nThe homophobic bedrock Re is built upon will bring up the past, as the author helpfully explains: \u201cAfter that non stop parade, it\u2019s time to switch things up!\u201d Cue the daring stereotypes: Nico and Yamori, the latter who beats and kidnaps heterosexual Kaneki, after Yamori stabs Kaneki from behind with his kagune no less (can you see me ker wink) and then violates him (implied in the manga during the centipede scene) \u201cbecause that\u2019s what those awful gays/ghouls do of course! Not to mention that Kaneki learned his lesson not to approach those ghouls/gays, see Tsukiyama, but horror alert, they come and kidnap you and do what they do!\u201d The author gives it his all.\\n\r\nThe editor, noticing that the author\u2019s eyes had stopped rolling in opposite directions in his head must have said, \u201cJust like straight people, LBGT people are awesome, do some good now, introduce people to offset this demonizing behaviour\u201d to which the writer replies \u201cof course! I\u2019ll introduce a trans character but only because my hate infused homosexuals are horrible monsters apologue has been caught and my editor is making me do it.\u201d This is good, greater representation is sound, but clearly Mutsuki is the result of an editor\u2019s input rather than being present due to the writers choice, the latters views on LGBT+ people are clear, discreet as they were. \\n\r\nThe writer, having his homophobic anthem of stereotyped, crude prejudices called out, was strong armed into adapting his ways, with condescending attitudes such as: \u201cWe\u2019ll show that Naki does care about Yamori! See! Those yucky gays/ghouls can feel human emotions too! Who would have thought?!\u201d The author did try, and though Mutsuki has been introduced, these serious issues have not been remedied in Re. Souta, who is of course \u2018fabulous\u2019 because the author relishes his out-dated stereotypes from a bygone era, and of course the homosexuals have to be villains to be defeated. Re doesn\u2019t do much to bring this back from the brink, indeed, in terms of grossly odd biased views it goes further over the edge! \\n\\n\r\nNote: (spoiler for manga, and where Re has set the stage, and will no doubt be shown in the later episodes this year) with Hide\u2019s \u2018because I love him\u2019 comment, and with the commentary that came with Kaneki choosing Touka when fans wanted Hide (apparently Kaneki's mind was so severely damaged that he considers hat stand Touka to be the most beautiful person he's ever seen. To his credit when Arima wants to mangle someones brain, he does not mess around), first accept deepest sympathies for fans of either of these pairings. To begin with, Hide was taken out for largely the entire story, so much for that pairing, or indeed any exploration of what was clearly a special bond between Kaneki and Hide. Even Touka & Kaneki shippers have a poor guy who really needs some psychological help and decent friends and loved ones around him, matched with a physically and emotionally abusive literal side bit of a character, now demoted here to a non-tier character. Be nice to Tokyo Ghoul fans, with this anime and series they don\u2019t have much to be happy about, still the pairing options are a testament of how greatly Tokyo Ghoul can fail. \\n\r\nAs for Hide, the author\u2019s rabid disdain of LGBT people may be the greatest clue to the outcome. It\u2019s very subtle (lock me away for criminal sarcasm, and throw away the key) but the author is very keen to portray LGBT people as horribly as possible, whether because they\u2019re made to be all harsh stereotypes, or through what the author makes them do and the message is resolute: ghouls/LBGT people are truly bad, and this will reflect in the treatment the author has in store for them, including Hide.\\n\\n\r\nWe can infer that Hide is romantically attracted to Kaneki because of the appalling way that the author perceives and treats homosexual people. \\n\\n\r\nCan you imagine what the author thinks, and precisely what he wants his audience to deduce: \u201cHide is an amazing person in terms of friendship, bravery and skill, but behind that perfection he\u2019s one of those yucky queerosexuals, and that therefore stops him being good! Turn on your dear, precious friend and hate him now because you\u2019ve discovered he\u2019s gay!\u201d \\n\r\nThough Hide is a great character, (don't make the silly mistake of referring to a Tokyo Ghoul drawing as a \u2018person\u2019, Tokyo Ghoul manga and animation has not ever, and does not bring its text and drawings on paper to life) but because of Hide\u2019s sexual orientation he has to be relegated to a minor part in the entire series, his brief cameo on a \u2018missing\u2019 poster here says it all. Perish the thought that we can have a focus on those creatures now! But we can, only if there are negative depictions of homosexuals and have them represented badly, hence the myriad of characters like Nishio \u2013 \u2018struggling\u2019 with same sex/unnatural ghoul desire, and the crass steryotypes Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Furuta, more or less every arc baddy of the day. Re lets it's hair down by plummeting head first right back into the mire with newcomers Torso, the woman hater gay stereotype that was designed to not exactly be \u2018manly\u2019 and drawn to Mutsuki \u201cyou know when those type of people meet, wink wink, nudge nudge\u201d being the suggestion. There is also the man hating lesbian, Nutcracker, and of course the exaggerated super horrible villain of Big Madam. Big Madam, birth sex male, and the no contest parent of the year in raising Suzuya. Can you hear it? listen closely, it's there, guttural chanting from the deepest recesses of the earth: STAWP THOSE HOMOTRANSOSAPIENS! Must stop them adopting DUR children at all costs, look what they DOO!\" You can just about make out the token \"will someone PLEASE think about the children!\" The author delivers its hysterical, paranoid anti LGBT adoption audience a pristine example of why we can't allow LBGT adoption like ever. The author also walks the walk since Suzuya ends up dealing with that nasty awful LBGT caregiver, PHEW! Thank heavens! And then all the LGBT's were never allowed to adopt again, and the heavens opened up in a sea of sunshine and reclaimed rainbows, all thanks to Tokyo Ghoul's on point message.\\n\r\nIt's strangely awe inspiring how may blundering, degrading steryotypes of LBGT people the authors imagined, he's won every game of Bingo don't doubt it. The little rascals fervently, wackadoodle, maniacal prejudice drenched head must have been smoking as it went into overdrive to conjure the whole gang. Then there's the rest, Ghouls/gays in general are made to be horrible looking and acting, don\u2019t forget depicted in such a heartless and sadistic manner, wanting to eat human flesh? As unnatural and revolting as wanting to be with someone of the same sex is the presumed meaning. \\n\r\nThe deeply rooted prejudice the author exhibits untoward LGBT people extends to Uta and Yomo, both single and meant to provide a theist example of how like Nishio, those evil gays/ghouls can be redeemed by resisting their impulses. Yomo is likely meant to be perceived as \u2018the homosexual uncle\u2019 (\u201csee! Those homosexuals can be useful and they can be family! Praise me for my deep revolutionary message!\u201d) It was more so the case for Uta if the author is associating Emo\u2019s with homosexuals \u2018deviant\u2019 behaviour (which actually is the case in some cultures) and it\u2019s why they\u2019re given the time they\u2019re given for the reader to get this poisoned, do you notice the gamma radiation, see the real story message for the whole of Tokyo Ghoul. \\n\r\nThe author also lays a heavy handed \u2018code\u2019 essentially stating that: \u201cKaneki as a straight person can end up experiencing the ghoul/gay scene with all its misery and horror but ended up living happily ever after, delightfully married to a lady!\" Never mind that it\u2019s scrape the bottom of the barrel Touka, so long as it\u2019s something, anything with female parts. \\n\r\nMeanwhile his homosexual best friend Hide can look on from the side-lines because that\u2019s the place of homosexuals in this series. Even if they are good natured then they can\u2019t have main roles or happy endings, they exist to revolve around the straight protagonist. If Hide were heterosexual, wouldn\u2019t be a problem, can be back-to-back with Kaneki in the thick of the plot (the way Banjou was despite him not serving much purpose fighting, or story wise, but Banjou's straight so it's cool, don't you know). But not straight? Not allowed (was also applied to the nice natured Yomo), homosexuals don\u2019t get page/screen time in stories unless it\u2019s in a negative light, just in case Nishio, Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Naki, Torso, Nutcracker, Big Madam, Souta and goodness knows who else, didn\u2019t give the game away. \\n\r\nThe author\u2019s pathological sickness concerning his mind set on homosexuals is only fully realised when we see what he has happen to Hide. If you were invested in this series, and we saw more of Hide we could actually emotionally react to the terrible maiming that occurred. We see that the poor guy has much of his mouth bitten off, teeth gone, neck severely damaged needing a voice synthesiser, the lot. The author really turned on Hide like some demented animal snapping and trying to murder it\u2019s own young after deciding Hide was that way. This was complete with the read between the lines message of \u201cthat horrific, life ruining scarring will teach Hide a lesson for trying to get close to Kaneki! Hope that teaches those homosexuals to try and kiss their friends! And kids! If you have someone who\u2019s gay and they try and kiss you/dare to show you affection, inflict that horrible injury on them too, gay panic defence nice and legal! The gays aren\u2019t your friends, they\u2019re horrible monsters out to eat you/show you affection, how awful!\u201d How awful indeed for the author to hold those toxic views, and to try and imprint them on an impressionable and resistless crowd. Make sure you\u2019re not duped, as tough as it is to resist this very convincing propaganda. \\n\r\nAdd to the fact that truly amazing people like his best friend Hide, a really nice guy, really clever, courageous, selfless, best of them all, that Hide was reduced to a plot device, had his lower face badly mutilated for everyone to see, just because he loves Kaneki, \u201cthat will teach those filthy gays, to be gay!\u201d (The author reinforces his concrete views by bringing Amon back, he too experienced the gay/ghoul treatment but like Kaneki he can be happily together with a woman, the ever bland Akira, oh how wonderful!... meanwhile the homosexuals/ghouls including the nice ones like Hide will end up with nothing, and that's if they\u2019re lucky). Says a lot that the heterosexual relationships, however contrived are meant to be considered nice, and distinguishes them to the homosexual ones, say Nico who was made by the author to just see Yamori as an attractive man nothing more, but that's how they think and act, get with the program already. The series is not a fan of happy endings for ghouls/gay people, just in case you couldn\u2019t tell.\\n\r\nOverall we may accept the authors treatment of ghouls/LBGT people as proof that Hide does indeed love Kaneki romantically because of what the author has diminished Hide to be. \\n\r\nEven their later reunion was to be superficially meaningless on another level, \u201coh hey best friend, always had my back, lost your face? Whatever I\u2019ve got Touka now, you\u2019re not a part of this story, still keep admiring the straight protagonist from over there, know your place now.\u201d Leave the author at his basement dungeon lair bending over and squirting Tokyo Ghoul out of all his seeping orifices into his braying fan army of hooting human rabbit dolls, it can\u2019t be any worse than this shoddy anime that was left behind.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Re gets a mercy 1/10 in this area for doing something to alleviate the LGBT equivalent of all the black face racism of the past that is central to the first season. The presence of Mutsuki, better that than nothing. But as the points with \u2018camp\u2019 Souta, Tsukiyama whose entire life revolves around Kaneki, to 'eat' him no less, and now Torso, Nutcracker and Big Madam, and especially Hide as explained above, the prejudiced undertones, well overtones now remain a central pillar of this series, and are still in the sludge filled pipeline to come. \\n\r\nDon\u2019t be deceived though, or lose heart, with the story, animation, the travesty of the cast, and now this, scraping Tokyo Ghoul off your boot is easy. The author can rest soundly, resolutely secure in the knowledge that he has completely and utterly failed to turn me against LBGT people. That one can immediately identify Tokyo Ghoul as not a thinly veiled jab at LGBT people, but correctly recognise this as the LBGT equivalent of some sort of crafted propaganda demonising Jewish people using crass stereotypes and behaviours. It can be viewed right now the same way we look at old racist Disney cartoons, interesting being modern, ancient history let's give it that. And appealing to the audiences suspension of disbelief to accept what is shown them, to be able to see through it all is a good skill for the audience to have. \\n\r\nDespite the major league, full throttle conditioning (subconsciously moulding the reader to think these are the issues the ghouls/gays face, keep away from them, see how horrible they look/are, virtually every villain is some variation of a LBGT stereotype, don\u2019t worry the good straight people all make it, but even the nice LGBT examples like Hide have to have the hammer fall on them) and the normalisation of extreme preconceptions this series espouses, Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s efforts must prove to be futile, it would not be wise to drink from this radioactive lagoon. And though Re continues to be the must have quintessential tool for some lobotomised fear monger to illustrate how ghoul society and how all the awful villains are supposed to represent LGBT people and how detestable they are, it can fail to lay a claim to our views. For the real overarching villain isn't the LGBT/ghouls, their society or the humans, not Arima, Eto or Furuta, the true villain is well hidden within plain sight. Hint, it's in the form of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, animation, the series itself, and the foul hateful anti LGBT message it champions. \\n\\n\r\n- Summary - Deserves some praise because Re does actually somehow manage to be worse than both previous seasons, no easy feat considering the state they were in. Re was supposed to make it all better but it doesn\u2019t. It could have righted the wrongs done before but it didn\u2019t. Though there is an intuition that suspects this was done to be spiteful, not just to the fan base, but casual viewers as well (the \u2018My Little Pony\u2019 creator mocked bronies, the cast of the \u2018Twilight\u2019 movies look down on the subject material and fans, and it\u2019s evident here that both the author and animation studio are repulsed by the Emo/Goth fan base of Tokyo Ghoul and are trying to shake them off). They also need hugs and whatever it takes therapy wise to cleanse them of their serious wrangle against LBGT people, don\u2019t worry though who\u2019s gullible enough to absorb anything from Tokyo Ghoul, right? It can't even patronise the viewer with some cutesy \"look Mom, I figured out gays/ghouls have feelings too just like us!\" Can we all agree to be beside our precious LGBT friends and family and disown the broken homophobes that had an accident on their failed expedition to the toilet and violently discharged Tokyo Ghoul? We can train them to be better, we\u2019ll be that good.\\n\r\nAdditionally, Re does have a remarkable penchant for resetting the established narrative, characters and repeating the exact same events with a deux ex machine memory loss, so they can parrot entire events but with the protagonist as a detective this time, complete with new rusty old forgettable clich\u00e9 characters as a bonus, whoop! \\n\r\nThis anime, in terms of plot, characters, animation, premise, everything is dull, and subpar, though nothing does dull and subpar like Tokyo Ghoul, and Re has taken that to a brand new, unprecedented tier of defective. Sorry guy versions of Twilight fans, and the Emo crowd, I actually am, for the author to cut his fan base loose, and for this series to plummet to ever greater depths must be hard, my condolences, though finding something good and leaving the series behind to wallow in it\u2019s own squalid filth takes nothing, that\u2019s for certain.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall verdict: negative points/10 \u2013 unworthy of your viewership or time, people are waking up and recognising Tokyo Ghoul as the \u2018Twilight\u2019 manifestation of anime. Identifying the male version of Twilight fans, who can see Bella and Kaneki in abusive, fake relationships with certainly no love, in no story, characters, everything is appallingly dire, why go on. Let\u2019s acknowledge that land fills like Twilight and Tokyo Ghoul may have their fans, but that does not mean that they are good. Tokyo Ghoul is a block so shockingly deficient and worthless from a literary and personal enjoyment perspective, yet under propped up by\u2026 really nice people. \\n\r\nUnderstand It\u2019s Ok for you to feel let down by this latest soiled diaper unto our fair earth; at this point what\u2019s important to note is that no you did not deserve this, and no it is definitely not your fault, you done NOTHING wrong to warrant this animation. Tokyo Ghoul Re was supposed to be everything to make up for the previous seasons, indeed the manga itself but, it just didn\u2019t want to, or couldn\u2019t. \\n\r\nThe problem is ingrained with the manga source material itself; it was already a fail by concept, character and story premise, had a reset in Re but repeated the exact same mistakes but to an even greater extent. To result in this animated abomination is an absolute travesty of our time. Try as you might you simply cannot polish excrement. You can strive to apply a glossy concealment but you can\u2019t disguise the material that lurks underneath and forget about containing the rancid stench. You can give Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s manga a shiny, well\u2026 at least not an eye exploding, hideous anime adaption, but the gloop within cannot be covered for long. And for all the production values, sound and animation, they sink into the heap that is Tokyo Ghoul. The good features on board go down with the ship. Whether it\u2019s the point blank refusal to center on the appealing characters (of which there are fewer in Re) or ignore decent plot options, to choose the exact same boring story, again, Re cannot trip over the hurdles enough and repeatedly. \\n\r\nBasic animation and voice acting can apply a cover, but what type of awful veneer is this anime? In hindsight the studio done the best with what they had to work with, and the weary and uninspired result is far from pretty. That they made a hippo mess failure of an anime, which should be safely disposed of, is actually a compliment considering the state of the actual manga. \\n\\n\r\nCasual viewers will likely have zero interest in the anime equivalent of an almost B-movie both in terms of the actual animation, sound and characters. Little here stands out, if you like police/detective stuff, find something that\u2019s worth it, this will leave you hanging. \\n\r\nPerhaps the fans can hope for an entire wipe the slate clean anime reboot, to properly polish out the swan dive to the bottom that route A was, and now this is. It happened with Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and that was astonishing, fingers crossed Tokyo Ghoul can also be redone and done as right as can be. Some people cling to anime to feel nice, that's fine, whatever makes them happy. Tokyo Ghoul, however is a life jacket made out of lead, a parachute that when opened is revealed to in fact be an anvil. Be decent and chuck people a bone here.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of dire, boring characters, uninspired dull plots, and always opting for the poorer choices instead of the enriching ones, nothing does it like Tokyo Ghoul. It may always be resented for choosing the worst when it could be the best, and the direction the whole dilapidated series took is a pale inferior shade of what it could have been. \\n\r\nRe has once again used it\u2019s tried and tested, super delicious recipe of baking a cake using ultra fresh cat vomit instead of flour, malevolent hobo droppings rather than icing, a choice collection of plague rat fur and tapeworm eggs for sprinkles, and who needs a cherry garnish when Tokyo Ghoul opts for a sublime bloated, fully loaded prolapsed rectum on top. The animation proceeded to make a malodorous finger paint, cave scribble with infected menstrual blood, savour Tokyo Ghoul to your hearts content, party people.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, If you\u2019re a fan of Tokyo Ghoul make sure you watch this anime, it\u2019s such a good adaption, you\u2019ll be really happy, and it will be so worth it, and you\u2019ll love it so, so much : )",

            "content": "Don't watch this anime.\r\nWhether or not you've read the manga, you'll be extremely disappointed by this mess of an adaptation. As someone who's been with :re from chapter one, I'm actually appalled by how horrible this anime is.\r\nThe story, although enjoyable in this part of the anime, is extremely rushed. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pacing, and at first I excused it, thinking they'd fix it by episode two, since the first episode tends to have weird pacing. But no, we're at episode five now and nothing has changed. Nothing is fleshed out, the interactions are rushed, and because of this, therelationships between characters seem forced and fake.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what you'd come to expect by a Tokyo Ghoul anime. I didn't mind the original's animation as much, but I have to point out that the animation is as boring and tasteless as A1 Pictures's. No fluid movement, rushed, boring, and so many frames look dumb and wonky, I can't help but rush. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the ending song a lot, considering I'm already a huge Queen Bee fan, and have mixed feelings about the opening. The music in the show is nothing to write home about- mostly just some weird synth beats that were made with no inspiration. It feels lackluster and boring and it really is. I feel like the performances of the voice actors are amongst the worst they've done, especially Natsuki Hanae's portrayal of Haise, which sounds stiff and really forced. I'm also extremely angry they decided to use a higher-pitched female voice actor for Mutsuki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the same as the manga, but are, as mentioned before, much less fleshed out. Can't say much here.\\n\\n\r\nI've been with :re since the beginning of its serialization, and what a shitfest it's been. These first three books are my favorite, and have a special place within my heart (yes, the anime got through volumes one through three in five episodes). But I can't say I enjoy this anime at all. I love Haise, so I enjoy seeing him, but other than that, I can't find myself looking forward to the episodes every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a three out of a ten. I'll most likely lower it.",

            "content": "-Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime)-\r\n-Episode Watched: 4-\r\n-Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) (Season 3) Score: 3/10-\r\n-Status: DROPPED-\r\n(Seriously, Citrus was a MUCH better anime than whatever this is)\r\nSo.....Tokyo Ghoul:re actually has gotten an anime series.....well.......that was a thing.....right anyways....I've been a fan of Tokyo Ghoul ever since I started reading the manga back in high school in 2015 and ever since then I was hooked by its characters, story, world and neat little lore and everything and it pretty much became my 2nd favorite manga series of all time (All time favorite being Berserk, of course) and so when I saw the previous 2 Seasons of the anime I was beyonddisappointed with the whole thing.....\\n\\n\r\n-Season 1 adapted 7 Volumes of the manga into 12 Episodes which pretty much felt the whole thing to be a rush job and it also changed story elements both major and minor that didn't need changing in the 1st place. But the most damaging flaw was that it focused more on action than the story, world and characters.\\n\r\n-Tokyo Ghoul (anime) (Season 1) Score: 3/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Season 2 titled \"Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA\" (Pronounced: Root A), on the other hand, was an anime-original storyline that featured some story elements from the manga but painted in a different light. All of which was spun the original creator of Tokyo Ghoul: Sui Ishida. So what went wrong here? The answer was simple, the story was beyond disjointed, confusing and made no sense, the characters were basically pointless and the whole thing overall felt like a bastardization and betrayal of Tokyo Ghoul and worst of all, remember when I said Sui Ishida made the entirety of \u221aA story? well the worst thing was that Studio Pierrot (The studio making T.G to begin with) pretty much threw Ishida's storyboards and drafts into the dirt and outright disrespected his work, granted they also did that with Season 1 but it's much more noticeable here and overall though, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA was REALLY BAD and no one, whether Manga Reader or Anime Watcher, should EVER waste their time with this at all.\\n\r\n-Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA (Season 2) Score: 1/10-\\n\\n\r\nSo then, when I heard that Tokyo Ghoul was getting a 3rd Season was never looking forward to this whatsoever. Later on, witnessed more and more of the anime being showcase I was still never impressed but what I saw and even though it was sticking to the manga this time, like Season 1, but with no recap or anything didn't make matters any better and it seemed like Studio Clown didn't learn their lesson after all. Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) gave me the impression that it was going to be on autopilot for the entire stay and you know, THAT'S a perfect description for it.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is the official 3rd Season of the Tokyo Ghoul anime series, \"adapted\" (adapted in Massive Quotes there and use that term very, VERY loosely) from the manga of the same name: Tokyo Ghoul:re (manga) which is a sequel series to the original series: Tokyo Ghoul (manga) which all done by the mangaka: Sui Ishida.\\n\\n\r\n---Story: 3/10---\\n\r\n----DISCLAIMER: In order to avoid confusion for Anime Only Watchers, Listen up. This season is not connected to Season 2 whatsoever in anyway, shape or form. It is a continuation of the events that transpired in the manga. So in other words, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA IS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!!!!----\\n\r\nSet 2 years after the events of the original manga (Read the manga, the light novels and [Jack] to fully understand those said events), Tokyo has changed drastically due the influence of the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), however ghouls themselves still pose has a problem to them especially the terrorist organization: Aogiri Tree (Read the manga to know who they are) as such, the CCG has decided to start up a brand new project by created their own set of Ghoul Investigators comprised of Half-Human, Half-Ghoul Hybrids (Well, more human than ghoul to be honest, but again read the manga to fully understand) known as the \"Quinx Squad\" (or \"Quinx\" or just \"Qs\" for short) in order to fight off the ghouls while being led by their mentor, Rank 1 Ghoul Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is) who has mysteriously suffered from amnesia as he can't seem to remember 20 years of his past life. (Again. He is EXACTLY who you think he is).\\n\r\n-Anyways, despite the fact that this show is \"adapting\" Volumes 1-5 of the manga into 12 Episodes (Just like Season 1), it doesn't excuse the fact that the story and overall writing for the was just straight-up flimsy, unlike its original source material, this isn't a deep story and there's literally nothing here. A MASSIVE amount of story felt like it was removed (and that's because it is). A lot of moments and element from the manga have been completely removed and changed and what was \"adapted\" from the manga even I knew they would screw up at, so any tension, character development, lasting impact and even symbolism is entirely removed. But on top of that, for Anime Only Watchers, they're going to get EXTREMELY confused when they watch this show because they won't know what's going on here and to make things even worse the show starts off as if everyone knows about what happened previously....NOT A GOOD SIGN and also LITERALLY NOTHING is ever explained and the whole thing feel completely rushed, even more so than Season 1. Seriously, though did the writer just fall asleep or just not give a shit?.....But anyways, I'm not gonna put too much energy into this simply because not much energy felt like it was placed into this. Tokyo Ghoul........could be enjoyable as its on anime series but with an anime series like this you can never really tell sometimes. However, if we're allowed to go back to that early comment I made about Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) feeling like it's on autopilot....I wasn't just talking about the story....-\\n\\n\r\n---Characters: 3/10---\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly comprised of returning characters like Kishou Arima, Akira Mado, Touka Kirishima, Juzou Suyuza, Hinami Fueguchi, Ayato Kirishima, so on and so forth and new characters like Karao Saeki, Miza Kusakari and of course, the Ouinx Squad: Rank 2 Investigator: Kuki Urie, Rank 3 Investigator: Ginshi Shirazu, Rank 3 Investigator: Tooru Mutsuki, Rank 3 Investigator: Saiko Yonebayashi and finally our protagonist: the amnesic Rank 1 Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is). While all of this may sound like good idea on paper, it's terribly executed in practice because none of the characters both old and new aren't really that interesting most of them are either undermined, uninteresting or just flat out unlikable with no rhyme or reason. Most of the character's personal motivations make absolutely no sense and it leave you scratching your head wondering why any of what they're doing is happening in the 1st place and none of their actions at all make any sense. Which is left a very empty feeling. In fact, the characters are just there for the sake of being there. (Seriously, the manga got the characters right so what's this show's excuse?). Also, one more THE OPENING SPOILED THE ENTIRE SHOW'S PLOT. I MEAN, WTF!?!?!\\n\\n\r\n---Art & Animation: 2/10---\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot is once again making Tokyo Ghoul and this time around they're not even trying. The art and visual style is a massive downgrade compared to Season 1, \u221aA and even the manga for the matter. Everything looked extremely cheap from the environments to the character design everything just looks half-assed and color palette looked completely muted, almost like the studio's ink cartridges ran out of ink and forgot to go resupply at the office depot. Seriously, Season 1 at least looked like it had some effort placed into it. The animation is some of the worse the series has ever produced it's completely stiff, unnatural and empty and overall nothing is really impressive in anyway, I mean, Good God even the action scenes suck, the action in the show in is barely any actual movement but it instead a bunch of still frames and slideshows that you can easily make in Mircosoft Powerpoint as a mid-term project. Sometimes there are a few times where the visual are pretty nice but still though overall, this is just not a pretty show to look at. Also, Touka once again has Purple Hair when in the manga she has Black Hair and later in early :re she has Light Blue Hair.....I mean, WTF!!!\\n\\n\r\n---Sound:9/10---\\n\r\nIf there's always one actual good thing about the previous 2 Seasons was the GORGEOUS Soundtrack and Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is no different. Yutaka Yamada once again returns as the composer for Tokyo Ghoul (anime)'s soundtrack and it's just as amazing as ever and it's overall fits the overall themes of Tokyo Ghoul, sporting some great piano and techno pieces and some amazing vocal tracks. As for the Opening and Ending Songs, Tokyo Ghoul (anime) has always had amazing songs as Unravel by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure, Munou (Incompetence) by \u00f6sterreich (which I'm might by the only one who actually did like the song) and Seasons Die One After Another by amazarashi (The only song I did like was The Saints by People in the Box because I thought it was pretty dull). For Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) the songs this time around are: asphyxia by C\u00f6 shu Nie and HALF by queen bee and both songs are really incredible and fit very well with the early stages of Tokyo Ghoul:re. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Voice Acting, the Japanese Voice Acting and the fit their individual characters quite I especially did like the performances of Natsuki Hanae, Kaito Ishikawa, Yuma Uchida, Natsumi Fujiwara, Ayane Sakura, Yu Kobayashi, Daisuke Namikawa, Takahiro Sakurai and Mamoru Miyano as Haise Sasaki/Ken Kaneki, Kuki Urie, Ginshi Shirazu, Tooru Mutsuki, Saiko Yonebayashi, Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, Kishou Arima, Uta and Shu Tsukiyama respectively. Overall, the Japanese Voice Acting is overall really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe English Voice Acting, on the other hand, was pretty weak none of the performances impressed me in anyway and voices themselves range from just fine, to boring or in the case of Daman Mills as Ginshi Shirazu just plain awful. On top of the almost none voices don't fit very well the characters themselves with only 3 expectations: J. Micheal Tatum as Shu Tsukiyama, Brittany Lauda as Miza Kusakari and Jeannie Tirado as Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, while I could've gone without the German accent but I think it kinda works. But still, I never did watched the previous 2 Seasons in English beforehand but if this seasons English Dub is anything to go by then I dodged a bullet I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The soundtrack is once again absolutely amazing as ever and it's easily the single good thing from this show. As for the voice acting, this is the very 1st anime series where I prefer the Japanese over the English, so I really won't recommend the English Dub.\\n\\n\r\n---Verdict---\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re (anime) just its predecessors is the living definition of misused potential, like I said earlier, Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is basically on autopilot from beginning, middle to end. This show is going back to \"adapting\" the manga like the 1st Season but like that Season Pierrot's means of doing so are means of subtraction of designs, themes, characters, core mechanics, story elements everything feels lesser here. If anyone are fans of the manga or otherwise DO NOT watch Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) and the previous 2 Seasons, there's no excuse for such a sloppy execution as an adaptation of the manga: it fails, as an anime series on its own: there are so many better options. If you like anime as much as the next guy or girl, Don't bother wasting your time with this series (and read the manga). Black Clover offered a better experience than this although I'd easily recommend My Hero Academia, Full Metal Alchemist, DARLING in the FRANXX and Citrus way above that show.\\n\\n\r\n~HERE'S HOPING TO A REBOOT FOR THE ANIME!!!~",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re is a highly misunderstood anime. Manga readers condemn it for its rushing of the plot; anime-onlys enjoy it for its fresh storyline and decent action. To enjoy TG:re to the max, you have to find a balance between these two common opinions by acknowledging that the anime and manga are two different entities that should be viewed - and enjoyed - separately. \r\nIshida is a phenomenal storyteller. There are a plethora of brilliant scenes that you can tell have been crafted perfectly and could not be any better. For instance, while the overall drive of the plot felt rushed and unnecessarily accelerated insome aspects, the focus on Haise regaining his memories was designed and paralleled perfectly with the original Tokyo Ghoul series; it made me feel nostalgic over Ken Kaneki's tragic tale. (\"If you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be a tragedy.\") The only criticism of the story, for me, would be the rushing of the plot (and in the process) ignoring certain scenes from chapters that add to the atmosphere of the series. However, as previously mentioned, it is my belief that an anime and manga should be enjoyed - or hated - separately, in order to get the most out of it. \\n\\n\r\nSome people hold the opinion that the animation is lacking in particular departments. This could be referring to the action scenes, the character stills, and/or the overall art. It is true that during some action scenes, the animation could have done with a new animator. In fact, the reason as to why some animated scenes flumped is because the anime was outsourced, which means that different studios work on different episodes, so quality can, and often will, vary from episode to episode. In spite of this, it is important to remember that TG:re and TG are not action-driven works (shounen) - they are, without a doubt, character-focused stories. Even more so, I personally prefer the new colour tint and animation style when it comes to the still scenes. Especially when Haise was the main focus on the screen - he looked fucking great. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its superb soundtrack. During the original TG, we were blessed with the work of art commonly known as 'Unravel'. Its closing soundtrack, written by the J-Rock band 'people In The Box' didn't fall behind the legacy of unravel much further, either. Ignoring the atrocity of the second season and its horrendous soundtrack, the opening song to TG:re, Asphyxia (written by Co Shu Nie) is almost as angelic as unravel. Some fans even prefer thus opening to its first, perhaps because of the chaotic buzz and fervent energy it installs in you as you watch and headbang to it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its ability (or rather, Sui Ishida's) to construct groundbreaking characters that you can't help but adore to watch. Whether her is Haise or Kaneki, I love this character as if he were my child. Not to mention the warm and fulfilling relationship between the QS members, which is something worthy of a prize itself. But in relation to Haise/Kaneki, this character glowed brighter than any other character so far, as he does in every season he is in - because that is the final product of Ishida's hard work and spectacular storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TG:re is a fantastic addition to the series. Now that the manga is coming to a close, the anime successfully provides its fans with the chance to fill their empty hearts as they wait - and beg - for another manga series in the future. As a whole, it is a work of art when you look at it from an outsider's perspective and refrain frm comparing it to the manga as an abundance of fans like to. Either way, if you read the manga or not, it is highly likely that you will find yourself enjoying the anime adaptation of TG:re, and hopefully, like me, end up adoring it. \\n",

It brings back old characters who maybe play a larger role later, but at the beginning seem to be there because they already existed in the first 2 seasons.\r\nCertain elements are very apparent immediately from the start, making me care less about the main character. Speaking of caring less, I care even less about the tensions between humans and ghouls since most of the main cast is some form of in-between, which just displays to the viewer that the tensionsare less than they were, when really they were supposed to be more.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, less enjoyable than the first 2 seasons.

            "content": "You're probably wondering whether or not I'm being serious about such a low score. Long story short, yes this show is really that bad. Frankly, at times I couldn't believe my eyes while watching this. I hope that after reading this review you'll see just how bad this show is yourself. \r\nSTORY\r\nNow, at that point most reviewers would recap the plot of the show, albeit in very broad terms to avoid spoilers and such. But here's the problem: this show has no plot. None. A thing happens, the characters respond to it, then they fight it out. Rinse and repeat. This has been a formulafor the second season as well, and surely enough it's back this season with no changes to it being done.\\n\r\nIt doesn't go anywhere, and even if character arcs are present, there's still no sign of an overarching narrative to tie them all together. Any story, in its essence can be divided into the beginning, the middle and the end. While Tokyo Ghoul certenaly had a beginning, we don't have a slightest idea if it progresses anywhere. The episodes feel disjointed and abrupt, pacing is all over the place. That is, however, the least of my problems with the series and this season in particular. Moving on to the \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the previous section I can at least say something about the characters of this show. While many of them are underdeveloped and bare-bones, it's definately the strongest aspect of the show. And by strongest I mean it's not completely abscent or all around terrible. \\n\r\nBefore talking about individual characters I want to adress by far the most outrageous aspect of the show. A lot of the episodes feature characters that were never introduced, but treated by the show like they have been, or like they matter. An episode can literally start with characters framed like we're supposed to care about them or at the very least know them. A lot of them end up dying dramatically, even though the viewer couldn't possibly have cared. I even ended up rewatching the previous episodes' endings to make extra sure I didn't miss an episode or two on accident. I didn't. I don't know if that's because half of the episodes got cut out from the show, or because the writers expect the viewers to be familliar with the source material or any other reason, it's simply unforgivable. With that out the way, let's talk about some of the more prominent characters. \\n\r\nThe Main Protagonist -- Is it even a spoiler to just call him Kaneki rather than Haise? I mean it was obvious from the start. And yet I don't feel like calling him by his real name. Why? Because Ken Kaneki is not even a character. They change him up, seemingly at will every single season, to the point where his name doesn't belong to any character. Kaneki from season one and Haise from season 3 are two completely diffirent characters, no matter what the writers want you to believe. Haise himself is incredibly dull, he lacks a character arc and prominent traits, unless caring for his friends a lot counts as one. You knew what was gonna happen to him, I knew what was gonna happen to him, so he really lacks any sort of hook. This guy is really hard to care about on any level. \\n\r\nUrie -- he's the best character this season, but once again, \"the best\" as in not entirely dull or boring. He has a character arc, complete with a motivation and a goal. Sure, it's all basic, but it exists and I have to commend the effort. His only gimminck of being an egoistical hypocrite still gets old very fast. \\n\r\nSaiko -- the token loli. She's listed as the main character in on the title page, but doesn't do anything. She can usually be found playing vidya or running around aimlessly with that big goofy-looking hammer. She's hinted to have an amazing power, but when she does it, it's kinda meh. \\n\r\nTooru -- no idea if it's a guy or a gal, either way had a lot of time devoted to him in the beginning of the season, only to be entirely forgotten about in the end. \\n\r\nShirazu -- the opposite of Tooru. Had nothing going for him at the beginning, only to rapidly develop a storyarc near the end. His only piece of characterization is having shark teeth.\\n\r\nJuuzou -- I'm only talking about him because he was my favorite character of the second season by far. Not only was he the only character to feature a proper arc and any sort of nuance to him, he also wasn't too boring in a fight. However, that was the last season (whitch was almost as bad as this one by the way). Here, Juuzou is a dissapointment, honestly. They skipped his character development to its conclusion, and so this season nothing happens to him. Even his fights have gotten boring.\\n\r\nShuu -- absolutely irrelevant as a character, despite having a hude arc of his own. I don't really get why I'm supposed to care about anything that's happening to him, he was never even likable to begin with. Since his very first appearance in season one, he wasn't shown to have a single redeeming quality as a character. \\n\r\nWell, that about covers most of the relevant ones, now onto the reason I can't see anyone ever enjoying this show: \\n\\n\r\nFIGHTS AND ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEvery action-driven anime lives and dies by the execution of its fight scenes. And by execution I mean everything in them, not just choreography and animation. Nontheless, if I had to start somewhere, I'd start with animation in general. It's all over the place, ranging from being legitimately not bad in some fighting scenes to being insulting in more somber moments. The low point to me was in episode 3 or 4, where, durning a conversation, animators used shot-reverse shot in such a way, that the speaking characters' mouth would not be visible. When it was their turn to talk, we'd only see their back, and not their face. I wish I was kidding. That being said, when the action heated up, the animation sometimes followed suit, for the more important battles. And that would even be sort of fun to watch, if not for two reasons: \\n\r\nFirstly, I had a hard time caring about any of the characters because of the reasons described in the previous section. And even without that, I couldn't enjoy the action at the most basic level because, secondly, there was no stakes. Let me elaborate. The ghoul powers are basically never put in any sort of easy to understand but concrete enough to follow bounds. Because of that, the viewer is never sure what's dangerous and what's not. At the writer's whim any hit can hurt the characters badly, or be completely ignored by them. \\n\r\nIs a gaping hole in your abdomen bad? What about being sliced in half? There are no answers to that. It's unknown just how much can the characters endure before going down, so you can't even follow the battles from that perspective. Some can die from a fairly normal looking wound, some can withstand being dismembered. You never know, so naturally, you never care.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I couldn't even enjoy watching this show just to laugh at how bad it was, like I can with some other ones. It was a chore all the way through. I can't, with good faith, recommend this show to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the sound was kind of alright, the OP was even good at times.",

            "content": "I am going to be reviewing Tokyo Ghoul:Re as purely an anime and judge it based on its merits as simply that. Not some appendage meant to supplement its source material. This has been my approach when viewing seasons 1 and 2, which is why I enjoyed them for the most part (to the dismay of manga readers). Who knows? Coming in as a blank slate probably made it slightly easier for me to enjoy them. The world we were introduced to was lucid and well-established right from the first episode of season 1. The story was elaborate and well-paced, the character dynamics and relationshipswere complex. The voice acting was emotionally laden and three dimensional. The music was superb and probably the best part of both seasons. While the animation, though tolerable, was possibly the weakest aspect. All in all, season 1 was a great watch and season 2 was not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think I would\u2019ve been overjoyed by TG:Re based on how I felt about its predecessors. And I was when it was announced. I stayed away from the manga for good measure here as well, so as to stay open minded just in case they opted for some creative liberties. Pointless. Tokyo Ghoul:Re was just difficult for me to watch... Part of why this was the case for me is that I kept convincing myself that it would get better. That somewhere in the episodes to come the writers would get on their feet and find their stride, that the studio was still setting us up for one huge payoff mid series. Just something. I kept making excuses to keep from losing interest and filling my head with as many excuses as I could conjure up until all that hope dissipated and I was left to confront my denial and convince myself that season 3 was a betrayal that should never have even happened. Everything that I loved about the first two was gone. They stripped it, left it unrecognizable and with nothing for it to stand on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNever mind that I didn\u2019t know where Kaneki had gone much less that he was still the lead of this series lodged in there somewhere, or what happened to all the other members of Anteiku and why Hinami wasn\u2019t a part of it anymore. It didn\u2019t take me long to figure out that the narrative had shifted and that the story would continue to unfold from the perspective of the CCG and its mish mash of new albeit incompetent faces. The story ran amok with no discernible direction. \\n\\n\r\nWith so much ground work laid from previously, it looked like none of that mattered here. It felt like a reboot more than anything else, but what really infuriated me was how it acted like we would somehow carry all that emotional package that season 1 and \u221aA worked hard to build in its audience and adapt it to an unfamiliar setting with a landscape of characters we don\u2019t even know let alone care about. It doesn\u2019t take the time to establish any of its characters or why they mean what they do to one another and by extension, the viewer. When you have a death take place and you want it to elicit an emotional response from me but instead you get a \u201cwhat on God\u2019s beautiful earth is going on here?\u201d then you ought to know that you lost a good moment to score points with me. Little two-minute flashbacks before killing someone off with the background characters watching in horror and disbelief doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to follow suit. You legitimatelyscrewed up. If you\u2019re going to start from scratch with a whole new palette of characters to kill off no matter how much I want you to win, emotional reactions are earned.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was another culprit that emptied this show of any evidence that I am on this show's side. It was so bad it made the voice acting seem awful. I know for a fact that the fault was in the writing because I looked up the cast and all of them are very capable voice actors with extensive work much of it laudable. These are all talented people who know what their doing if given decent material to work with. And no amount of talent could save it, unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nBut the music, of everything else that was done horribly wrong was the one biggest assault against the body of work that got me interested in the anime. I was shocked to learn that Yutaka Yamada composed the score here. He scored the previous seasons and did an amazing job of elevating even the most mediocre scenes and turning them into something to reflect on while holding back tears. Nothing akin to that here. This was the laziest score I\u2019ve ever heard since the decline of Hans Zimmer in Hollywood. Even Yamada was utterly uninspired by the events of TG:Re. He has unapologetically done away with the sophisticated symphonies that accentuated the mood of first two seasons. His \u201ccompositions\u201d here are, as if in protest, simple synth beats just as hollow as everything else about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was never Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s strongest factor, but with nothing else going for it, it seems to me to be unwise to lower your standards at that as well. The character designs were pretty basic with faces constructed from rudimentary shapes meant for colour in books. The action sequences are the notorious one frame movements that don\u2019t spark any tension. They don\u2019t feel even mildly exciting or rewarding in the few places they have been sprinkled in. They look like an afterthought of some sort much like the music.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted this show to be good. I believed what was done before it was a work of art that though wasn\u2019t flawless, was honest in its intentions to take us on an adventure. I have vehemently defended the anime against its own manga fans for years but I can\u2019t stand behind this and still claim to be an anime fan. I stand on the side of art that showcases passion. Whether it stays true to the source or not is immaterial to me personally. The effort just has to be there. I don\u2019t know what this was, sadly. I just couldn\u2019t recognize any of this. But what I could spot could be summed up in one word: Lazy.",

            "content": "This is perfect example how to totaly bungle the sequel. I seen previous seasons of Tokyo Ghul and I can't still belive this is possible to create such poor continuation.\r\nLet's start with the plot - to begin with I am not a manga reader so as avarage viewer all my infromations come from previous seasons.\r\nTo be honest first season was something \"fresh\", well made with very good soundtrack and composition. Tokyo ghul was touching some interesting and important topics as \"what is bad\" and \"who is bad\" and all dilemma related to being a ghul. \r\nSecond season was also well made but I felt abit lost there. Whole anime was from very different perspective - everything was mixed and many actions of characters didn't make any sense but still that was something decent.\\n\r\nAs the first season I rated [9] and second [8], this one deserves hard [5] and this is why:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all I have completely no idea what is happening and more importantly - why. Third season starts with completely new environment, characters + main character can't remember his past so he is totaly different person and [whoa!] this time he is the one who fights ghuls. \\n\r\nThe worst thing in this mess is the fact that in previous seasons we had some kind of \"balance\" between bad and good ghuls/people but this time we recived simple 2 facts:\\n\r\n- ghuls are bad because they are bad. (even tho they are acting good)\\n\r\n- humans are good because they are. (although they are actually acting like villains)\\n\r\nThis time there are no questions why they are bad or good. It's just a fact.\\n\r\nMoreover whole climate of first and second seasons has been changed to completely idyll world with some \"ghul problems\". The fun thing is that the show still tries to be serious but it just can't be taken serious with whole crap we can see on the screen becasue after seeing the first episode we know where exactly this show is going.\\n\\n\r\nThe second great problem are motives of characters and behaviour. \\n\r\nNo one. None of the new characters is likeable. They have no good motives, stupid past and in overall they are just not interesting or even retareded. I have got feeling like they have the same knownlage of what they are doing in this show as me who watch it. As addition we can see some characters from previous series like group commanders and other \"soldiers of peace\" and they only exists to die in the fight.\\n\\n\r\nIf it comes to fight - in general half of this show is some kind of battle but fights looks sooo poor and avarage that you can see better fight scenes by opening very random anime from genre 'school life' or 'sport'. \\n\r\nBassicaly, fights looks like showing key scenes, effects of fight so in result we get constatly scenes aka \"I penetrated you with my kagune N-th time\" or \"I strangle you 10th time but you still don't die\". By the way very strange thing is current balance between ghuls and humans. Single random ghul can be easly killed now by some strange not-kagune weapon aka sword not to metion it can block few big kagune and ... I just don't understand what happened during last 2 years.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to mention is soundtrack and art. As the the first season came with great piece of music and decent art then this time I have to say we are attacked by medicore or very bad looking backgrounds and animation. Quality of TG:re is not so bad itself but compositon and animation parts of it is so bad executed, its not comparable to previous seasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs summary, this is probably the worst execution of sequel I have ever seen in my life. This show can't be compared to previous seasons in any terms. Simply speaking Tokyo ghul:re completely eliminated all good aspects of this series making it bad animated, poor, avarage sh*t show.",

This season achieved the impossible, by somehow being even worse than the second season. \r\nStory : 1\r\nThe pacing in this season is absolutely dreadful. From the get-go, you already have no idea on what is going on. It is revealed that Kaneki has lost his memories and is now living as a different person. While this sounds interesting at first, after a few episodes in you begin to wish that he would just turn back to his former self as soon as possible. Until this date, Ihave no idea what the plot is or what anyone hopes to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 2 \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much garbage compared to the standards of current short series anime. It looks cheap and bland. nothing spectacular and frankly disappointing for an anime as over hyped as this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\\n\r\nI did like the soundtracks though. Mostly the ones that were from previous seasons. However, there was a scene where they used the first opening and it kind of pissed me off because of how shitty the scene was. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 1\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be the shittiest supporting cast ever. I generally dislike every single person in this show except maybe Kaneki. Any character development that Kaneki received is all thrown out of the window form the beginning of the season. His crew is straight up uninteresting and bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1 \\n\\n\r\nWhile I was a fan of Tokyo Ghoul when the first season came out, it wasn't enough for me to get through the entirety of this garbage ass season. My recommendation for people considering watching this sequel... PLEASE DON'T. I had to put myself through the disservice of sitting through 7 episodes of this nonsense.

While it looks great and has some great fights, TG:re is confusing and frustrating. I don't know where my season 1 tokyo ghoul storyline went, but I missit.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main new themes introduced in TG:re are the \"quinx\" members of the CCG, who are introduced out of nowhere. While there are a few info dumps that try to explain this dramatically new direction where the CCG is actually using half-ghouls as weapons, it isn't satisfactory. Each of the quinx members have their own slice of backstory to justify their existence, but there isn't enough depth. Maybe it's because the cast has grown way too large, and because adding 4 new main characters isn't going to work in 12 episodes...\\n\\n\r\nThe most egregious mistake was the way they handled Haise. Although I feel that the manga readers have a better understanding of what's going on, as a show watcher I was only able to vaguely understand what he is halfway through the season. And if Haise did the fusion dance with Kaneki, what about Rize who's supposed to be part of Kaneki's body? From what I remember, she never appears. Also, the lack of Touka Kirishima screentime was with him was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what else to say. The show did look and sound very good, and I enjoyed it enough to sit through the whole season, but the plot and characters fell very short of the standard established in season 1.",

            "content": "Tokyo Kushu Re is bad excuse for a sequel. The story starts off as a complete mess, directly jumping into action without any build-up and focusing around characters that have not even been introduced. Somehow the series assumes that it doens't have to put any efford into explaining any of these new things because it's part of already existing franchise.This makes it very hard to actually care about anything that is happening.\r\nSoon after, it becomes clear that our main character has gone thru some trauma and now suffers from amnesia. Great, isn't this just perfectly cliche writing and also a way to turn all thecharacter development seen in season 1 and 2 back to zero. I am not exactly sure what type of author hates their characters so much to go and do something like this. I disliked Kaneki Ken in the beginning of S01, but still came to like him because of his character development. And now I am supposed to see the same shite again? How about no. Alternative version in the same universe would have been a much better idea.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI admit, I was never a big fan of Tokyo Kushu. I did see S01 twice, S02 once and read the manga once, but still this 3rd season is inferior in every way. All the good things were removed, the director was changed and now the OST - which made the first seasons seem better than they actually were, is now garbage, too. Thus far, there has only been one good scene in the whole show in episode 2 and even that was lend from S02. It's very hard to recommend this to anyone. Especially those who liked the original series for its characters should stay far away.",

            "content": "!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!\r\nI'll start off by saying that Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul :Re are two of my favourite manga that I've read and they both hold a significant place in my life. The anime adaptions before :Re had been iffy to say the best, Season 1 of TG whilst not terrible left out a lot of content due to how few episodes they had and Root A was flat out awful.\r\nSo moving onto the anime adaption of :Re I was very apprehensive about how it was going to play out. Would they try and mish mash anime original and manga canon materialagain like they did with Root A or would they ignore Root A and stick to the manga? At the time of these thoughts it wasn't clear on the direction the show would take, thankfully they decided to forget Root A completely and pushed forward with adapting the :Re manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the :Re anime ignores the Root A anime is going to leave a lot of anime only people confused, my advice along with the advice of the creator of TG, go read the original manga chapter 1-143 and then you can watch :Re but perhaps you should read it instead. \\n\\n\r\nHow well have they done? The short answer is not great, worse than season 1 better than Root A. \\n\\n\r\nThe long answer, well buckle in. :Re's biggest problem is its budget. The animation and general art in the show are poor, it is clear that this is the work of people who aren't the best in the business and that are working under time constraints. There is very much a real lack of soul in this anime and I think a lot of that is due to the budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe next major problem for the :Re anime is the pacing. Just like season 1 they've got very few episodes / minutes to tell the story of the first 57 or so chapters of the :Re manga and as manga readers will know :Re starts slow and has a lot of content in those first 50+ chapters. Several episodes adapted 5-6 chapters worth of content the rest around 3-4 chapters per episode. Due to the budget and pacing, a lot of details were left out most notable Haise touching his chin and Fluffy hair Touka. These small details are what made the manga so good. \\n\\n\r\nNow :Re's anime didn't do everything wrong, once again the score has been generally A+ The opening Asphyxia is almost as good as Unravel and the closing isn't too shabby either. As well as the opening / closing tracks there are several other songs the names of which I do not know that are really quite good, especially the song when Haise and Touka meet. \\n\\n\r\nAnother 1+ for the anime is in regards to the VA, there are 1 or 2 that sound odd (Suzuya and Kanae both sound pretty bad imo.) However, the rest of the cast put in a very strong performance and I was very pleased to see some familiar names return to voice characters that had previously voiced in past seasons. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately the anime falls short it was handed a fantastic story on a silver plate and they did it a disservice with how cheaply they made this show. A lot of the focus was put on the fighting which is just a small part of what the manga is and when the animation is as bad as it is in :Re there is nothing to be but to be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the Manga my advice is watch it if you've really got nothing better to do, if you're an anime only well I'm sure you're pretty confused in general about :Re and it's probably best you go and read TG and then  TG:Re if you really want to experience the story as it was intended. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 5.4/10",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul except everything that was good is bad.\r\nAs a fan of the first two seasons I can't see this season as anything other than a massive failure and disappointment.\r\nStory-5\r\nVery tiny spoiler: Haise is Kaneki. Wow this show is boring. I'm not sure that a single interesting thing has happened in 12 episodes. Basically it's just 12 episodes of Haise and his new buddies fighting ghouls. Not a single fight is cool, interesting, or well animated, and not a single character is as good as a character from season one. \r\nOne thing I found so great about the original is that the man-eating ghouls whocouldn't possibly seen as good people were constantly and effectively humanized through the folks at Anteiku.  It presented an incredibly difficult and interesting conflict where ghouls and humans desperately want peace but simply cannot coexist. Kaneki and friends constantly tried to balance peace and protecting their friends and that's part of what made the show great. \\n\r\nWell no more Anteiku. No more of Kaneki's old friends. And no more ghouls that are worth caring about. They're all gone and replaced with Haise's boring crew of half ghoul investigators and a bunch of ghouls who's most interesting and human trait is that they don't want to die.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nSignificantly uglier than the original. The drop in animation quality is actually both astounding and depressing. A show that could be praised for it's stellar animation and dark edgy art has fallen so so low. It's production budget is likely close to half of the original and it shows. Not one fight sequence is cool or impressive and the art can also be incredibly inconsistent at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\nAlso a big step down. The opening is good but not nearly as good as the original. The ending is also fine but kind of weird and not worth adding to any kind of playlist. All the background music is mediocre and totally forgettable. The sound does almost nothing to improve this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-4\\n\r\nThis is actually the worst part of the show. Haise has to be the most boring main character I've seen all season, maybe all year. His only character trait is that he cares about his friends and his current lifestyle. It's essentially impossible to get anything more than that out of his character. Every time he speaks it's something about how much he loves his life or how he doesn't want to be Kaneki again because he loves his life so much right now. I was constantly wanting him to return to being Kaneki against his will because I was so damn tired of Haise's babbling.\\n\\n\r\nNo side character is worth me mentioning with the exception of Urie (half ghoul investigator who works under Haise) who has untapped potential as of now. All the new ghouls are boring. All of Haise's new friends are a bore. They add nothing to the show whatsoever. The biggest internal conflict seen in a side character is \"Damn killing ghouls is kind of sad.\" Really groundbreaking stuff. Massive failure in character writing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-5\\n\r\nObviously I did not enjoy this show and my expectations were shattered. This show has almost no redeeming qualities, and I never once looked forward to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nI don't understand how anyone can watch the all three seasons of Tokyo Ghoul and say that this one stands up to the first two. It's clearly a massively overambitious failure of a project. \\n\r\nI haven't read the manga and I don't plan to. This is a review of the anime only.",

After watching this train wreck I didn't even feel anger, as if at that point I was numb to the disappointment. All I could say was \"Well that sucked\". A few day later I have decide to write a review, because I'm just so bitter.\r\nS T O RY 3/10\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:Re's plot is carefully constructed, into a smart and clever story, leaving you desperately anxious and on the end of your seat as you watch the characters tragic tales overlap...- if only I could say the same for the anime.

When these important events are ignored future events don't make sense, because they are meant to be a consequence of that past important event????? that you just cut out for no reason???? Also, since this show hadn't adapted the end of the first series, Tokyo ghoul, the whole plot makes no sense, because that is what triggered Tokyo Ghoul:Re to occur in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nA R T 3/10\\n\r\nThis really upsets me to give it such a low score, this is because at the start of the series the animation was pretty solid and nice to look at. However after episode 3 its just crashes right down into the mud. The animation looks lazy, boring, ugly, flat, silly and downright offensive. While most people for some reason praised the art style I thought it was generic and looked like any average low-budget anime. \\n\\n\r\nS O U N D 4/10\\n\r\nThe Tokyo Ghoul anime adaptations are famous for having its surprisingly good soundtracks that truly manipulate the viewer emotions, such as \"Licht Und Schatten\" plus \"Unravel\" from Tokyo Ghoul and \"Glassy Sky\" also with \"On my own\" from Tokyo Ghoul Root A. With the standard set so high you'd naturally expect :Re to be the same. Well... ehhhhh. I Mean, its not bad, its far from bad... but nothing was good. There was no song that made you go like \"Holy crap that is amazing\", it was all forgettable and just meh but with the bar set so high for the music in the TG franchise, \"meh\" isnt good enough. Thus it having a low score of 4, even if it would be forgivable with any other show.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R S 2/10\\n\r\nThe characters were bland and left a nasty aftertase. In the Tokyo Ghoul:Re manga, at first these characters still do look bland and generic, but what saves them from staying this way is the amazing and well thought out backstorys and future character development. Annoyingly, the anime fails again to make a solid stride and doesn't give any of these characters the proper stoplight they deserve. Apart from Haise and Urie all of the developments and backstories are rushed. Instead of them spending a good episode length on the development (like I think they should be) some of them are mushed into a dreadful 5 minutes. I think that Urie's execution and portrayal of his personality traits, inner monologue and backstory were wonderfully done; so was Haise's. If only I could say the same for the rest of the cast, then it would have a much higher score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nE N J O Y M E N T + O V E R A L L 1/10\\n\r\nI think that what annoys me so much is the potential this show has, this show could be truly amazing if it wanted to be, it has the right material to do so. Unfortunately the studio behind it is too lazy to care and just wants to squeeze as much as the can get from the manga, instead of treasuring it and understanding how to correctly adapt the work. I have to be extremely harsh on this series because believe it or not; I WANT IT TO DO WELL!! So when it doesn't I'm going to be very mad. I do not recommend this show to anyone, even if your an anime only just don't bother because the show wont make sense anyway and you'll just be confused. If you're a manga reader while it is nice to hear the characters voices and see the fights moving I still don't advise it, as it just is painfully frustrating to watch. Overall I have to give it a 1... Thank you for reading my review ( \u2022\u2304\u2022 \u0942 )\u2727",

            "content": "Note: This is a review coming from an anime only viewer.\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re is one heck of a series. From the start, you are taken on the world of Sasaki Haise, and the Quinx squad. The story, at the beginning, was quite confusing, having no context about the actual series at all. However, the pieces start to fall in much later, and the story gets more in depth than before.\r\nThe story in here is really good, with a complex and unique story which surprisingly shocks me at some points, and makes me laugh at other points. I definitely didn't expect to cry in this, but Iwould be lying if I didn't cry at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was alright. I mean, the animation and the styling done in :re doesn't match up to images of the manga that I've seen, which looks a lot better than this, but then again, the first two seasons were just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and the choice of really different sounds was something that really felt right. It's not the typical soundtrack that most people are accustomed to; it's different, dark, unpredictable and very suited to the story of :re.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation here is another good point. The contrast of Kaneki and Sasaki is quite striking, and really well done. The Quinx squad all have their unique quirks, and I especially love how they managed to put a different spin on the characters than what I've typically seen. The characters that were also present in the original series have clearly changed, bringing the story and characters to a different level than what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was something I thought was alright. The series was definitely made for manga readers, and for a person like me who hasn't read past the two chapter of the original, I definitely couldn't enjoy it due to my lack of context. I think that if I knew the context better, and knew what really happened instead of what we got in Root A, then I would have definitely enjoyed it more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is a wonderful work, and was something I didn't expect that I would like as much as I thought. Although I'm an anime only water, this has definitely incentivised me into reading the manga, and after watching the final episode, it makes me really look forward to season 2 of :re.",

            "content": "For me as a long-term Tokyo Ghoul fan, the newest anime adaptation does little to redeem the troubled state the Tokyo Ghoul franchise, as a whole, is currently in. \r\nTokyo Ghoul :re starts out strong, even if not as outstanding as the original. There's (still) the man-eating species known as \"ghouls\" terrorizing modern Tokyo. There's (still) the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG), a complex, very police-like organization tasked with protecting the populace from this menace. The job of a CCG investigator is hard: identifying a ghoul is only half the story, since ghouls will resist with superhuman abilities; prominently \"kagune\", predatory tentacle-like appendages. \r\nWhile theoriginal Tokyo Ghoul focussed on a group of \"pacifistic\" ghouls in hideout from merciless capture and extinction, the narrative focus of :re shifts, at first, to the CCG. We're introduced to a colorful palette of completely new investigators. There's timid outsider Mutsuki, likable simpleton Suzuki, lazy nerd Saiko (the only girl in the squad ... or is she?) and resentful careerist Urie. Our main character also appears in this underperforming CCG squad, as enthusiastic but ultimately unfit leader Haise Sasaki. \\n\\n\r\nGradually, the one-dimensional ghouls-vs-investigators massacres will make place for a twisted, unpredictable narrative. Since Haise Sasaki isn't just a mediocre investigator: figures from his past will resurface -- and they're not only investigators-gone-missing from the first part, but also ghouls with a game-changing agenda. \\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the namesake for the sequel is cafe :re, where old acquaintances are waiting for Haise to make his move. \"re\" may also reference to the one-eyed king: the legendary ghoul-human hybrid that will put an end to the dramatic inter-species war: but how? And what are the brutal ghouls of Aogiri, the human (?) elites of the CCG, the enigmatic V and the psychopathic Clowns up to? We'll find out, but as Kaneki from the original Tokyo Ghoul warned us: this story will become a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nSounds like a fantastic anime? Well, it certainly could've been. If (!) the anime was well-produced and, more importantly, if (!) the source material (manga) had kept its shit together. My disappointment could not have been greater, as neither has proven to be true.\\n\\n\r\nThe :re anime repeats the exact mistake of previous Tokyo Ghoul adaptations, by running through at a breakneck pace, which doesn't let story or characters breathe. The mostly great character designs from the manga haven't been built and improved upon in the anime; instead, they have been colored in a rather flat and predictable fashion, as far as I can tell. \\n\\n\r\nYet, these minor complaints actually pale in comparison to my actual complaint: it's not about the anime-specific adaptation issues, as I may need more episodes to properly evaluate these. My actual complaints are about the source material, the Tokyo Ghoul :re manga series, whose deep flaws a middling anime adaption will only exacerbate. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the original manga series used to have it all: a flashy and well-executed concept of man-eating humans, iconic art direction with memorable and unique character designs, an engaging story with a multitude factions and facets, fascinating characters, tense edgy atmosphere, references to highbrow literature done right, and, last but not least, gory over-the-top action.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these perks placed the original Tokyo Ghoul manga far, far above yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). Now, straight to the issue: what the sequel to the brilliant original, Tokyo Ghoul :re, turned out to be, is ... yr average run-of-the-mill dragged-out-for-profit shonen action series (think of One Piece, or Bleach). \\n\\n\r\n:re, currently amassing 170 or so chapters, managed to stay good for about 60, decent for about 90 and tolerable with a grain of salt for about 120 chapters. With infuriating rigor, Ishida Sui murders his story and forcefully drags its mutilated corpse so far away from the original direction that leaving it to fan-fiction aficionados may have been a kinder fate for this once great series.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with needless and anti-climactic deaths of his very best characters, Ishida proceeds to rush through long-awaited plot developments in the least satisfying way imaginable. Equally disappointing, populist and banal climaxes to formerly subtly blossoming romantic and personal relationships follow. What's left is a pointless and directionless exercise in continuing for the sake of continuation, as long as sales numbers permit.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the bumpy path to ruin, we will be served city-sized monsters and banal melodrama as surrogates for psychologically compelling writing. Formerly interesting female heroines will be reduced to subservient breeding cattle, in \"best\" shonen traditions. \\n\\n\r\nSound power balances will be abandoned; battles will be decided by kicks to the groin. In the increasingly rare case a confrontation becomes interesting, it HAS to end offscreen, lest this manga might become interesting again. Death flags will be ceremonially displayed in lame cliffhangers, but no one ACTUALLY dies in this manga. Unless it's an interesting and well-written character: then, its either offscreen butchering or poorly motivated suicide for ya. \\n\\n\r\nAt his worst, the main antagonist acknowledges he had no idea what he had been doing the last 60 chapters. Well, neither does the reader. The authors' self-awareness seems to slip through, as he ends his worst chapter so far with the line \"Stop. Just stop.\" \\n\\n\r\nI'm not exaggerating. Read the manga. Or, rather -- don't. It's a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nSuper peace.\\n",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\n0/10, Unfortunately a huge let down, an almost exact repeat of the mistakes made before, this anime is both an unusually bad adaption, sequel, and has been vastly overhyped.\r\n- Characters: 0/10 - Does what Tokyo ghoul does best, it ignores interesting characters, and instead focuses on the subpar, uninteresting ones. After establishing a bland and unchanging cast from the first series, this pointless sequel throws them all under a bus and replaces them with insert generic copy and paste characters here. This now includes the protagonist, the author waited until this sequel to reset him with a deux ex memory loss to retcon hisdevelopment. Also with Nishio, he does get to come back but Re resets him too so, surprise, surprise he\u2019s right back to what he was doing before. \\n\r\nSimilarly, Touka was the most popular character in popularity contests in the first manga, so naturally she had to be demoted to a side character here (remember Tokyo ghoul\u2019s claim to infamy is that it identifies the good members of the cast fans like, and purposely boots them to the curb in favour of second rate, extra inferior characters. This fails in terms of concept, an audience would want to see cool and great characters, not insert wooden acting person or ghoul here, character wise it chose the wrong path to walk). \\n\r\nRegarding Touka, the female lead, even though Kaneki at first fancied Rize, and didn\u2019t give Touka the time of day, Tokyo Ghoul is somehow convinced that Kaneki would fall madly in love with the most trite, insipid person on the market. It\u2019s because she was supposed to have her Emo black hair for Kaneki to fall head over heels in love with, so they can have a Marilyn Manson themed romance later. In a dire attempt to introduce a tender moment (Kidding you not, Touka is waiting for Kaneki to regain his memories/cut Kaneki right out her life, perfectly content with moving on without him, \u201ctwo years later my life\u2019s fine without you, seen you again, you mean nothing to me.\u201d) It brings to mind the \u2018Twilight\u2019 comparisons, just bizarre, mismatched and wholly unconvincing attempts at romance with clumsy plastic characters, and it doesn\u2019t work, unless it\u2019s an Emo\u2019s unite (spoiler, it is) series, funny that should be mentioned.\\n\r\nIdentically, Amon, the only one with some sense, a capable fighter and strategist has disappeared, again because he was a good character and, don\u2019t forget, Tokyo Ghoul can only focus on the third rate, especially dull characters, all eyes on you Quinx squad.\\n\r\nThe added problem with this is the author already tried this by establishing the bad characters as the focal point in the first series. The animation studio made them worse than they were on paper, route \u221aA spiral dived further underground. Now Re is out with a vengeance of a retcon, even direr characters to revolve around in the form of everyone, with the occasional call back to the least inspired props from before. It\u2019s like some kind of aggressive belly flop to the bottom in making the poorest excuses for characters as possible, quite impressive in hindsight. \u201cInteresting characters, and character development? What are those?\u201d \u2013 author of Tokyo Ghoul Re, clearly. Not to be out manoeuvred the studio leaped on the bandwagon: \u201cNice looking, well drawn, emotive animated characters with good voices? Does not compute\u201d \u2013 the studio\u2019s apparent view.\\n\\n\r\nThe other result of this is that Tokyo Ghouls main niche audience, the Emo \u201cmy life is such a black abyss\u201d crowd have also been rejected and forgotten, by the author himself no less. I think the creator was like \u201cit\u2019s ok! In Re the Emo\u2019s are gone! Even Juuzou\u2019s had his body modifications toned down, look! Normal, \u2018cool\u2019 people now!\u201d Disrespectful towards fans who come to this series for a certain validation (\u201cmy mom told me to do my homework, but I want to grow my fringe all over my face, I can totally relate to Tokyo Ghoul\u201d) not to mention it remains unacceptable for anime fans that want to see something promising, and this reset couldn\u2019t even provide it when it had the chance to attempt it. \\n\r\nCharacters, with good, bad, in between traits, whatever quirks they have, are vital to a great story; Tokyo Ghoul Re characters don\u2019t warrant a second glance. To fail to create anyone likeable, or unlikable in a series that is supposed to flesh out the backgrounds of even minor players, there is something fundamentally unsound with the premise. The anime couldn\u2019t even bring them to life with voice acting, expressions, or anything. How on earth an anime can be created where you don\u2019t like a least one character and want to follow their story, hear their voice, see their expressions and who they are, I\u2019ll never know, but Re has achieved that. \\n\r\nIgnoring popular characters to focus on ones with even less likeability, and having no complex development in quite a harsh world that should draw something, anything out doesn\u2019t work for a reason. It is not needed, or courageous for Tokyo Ghoul to play a necessary evil and remind manga and anime creators that sketchy characters and menial plot routes make for a subpar anime, everyone already knows.\\n\r\nThe repercussions of this, and the greater failure, is that the audience will find it challenging to become invested in a story. It\u2019s more like looking at playing cards: that\u2019s not Kaneki, that\u2019s chew toy number one, there\u2019s wall flower whoever, indeed Hide, not the best friend, rather the plot device is also missing. Whether it\u2019s Hide, Rize, guy Mado, even a comatose Shinohara, whoever it is, the golden rule of this series is to stamp out the good characters, Tokyo Ghoul always makes that clear. \\n\\n\r\n- Story: what story?/10 - Decided to reset the previous Tokyo Ghoul and voila, here\u2019s some detective, whatever the heck is going on with this plot (genre wise its a reminder of a show called \u2018Descendants of Darkness\u2019 which was effective in the sense that it done what Re is trying to do here but done it a lot better. That Re came out some time after but hasn\u2019t added anything new to this genre is discouraging). \\n\r\nRe\u2019s animation couldn\u2019t do anything for the clich\u00e9d and monotonous arcs, no need to describe the failures of the story in detail, but spoiler alert, Re is just essentially the same as the first manga. It just shows the human detective viewpoint, with the added bonus of missing good characters, the Emo\u2019s have been white washed removed, and there is a clich\u00e9 crime watch plot this time, in lieu of the fractured nonsensical one the first time round.\\n\r\nThe audience (especially those who haven\u2019t read the manga) may not know what is going on with the story, and it\u2019s not hard to acknowledge; you don\u2019t actually need to care. This brief advert for the manga has too much material condensed in far too few episodes, and complicated further when there\u2019s a fundamental detachment between the audience and this series. What does the casual viewer want to see? A bargain bucket police academy? What do the fans want? An anime where significant material has been scrapped, and a supposed seinan manga crammed into this? Have I missed something?\\n\r\nThat so many manga chapters are condensed into a 12 episode series was, quite frankly shocking to learn, and really sets the bar for the failures to come. Couldn\u2019t even give some nice text or sentences worth listening to in this rock bottom adaption. The only suspicion is that Re was made with the express intention of being bad on purpose to big up other series, imagine: a studio could point to their other anime and say, \u201clook doesn\u2019t this look good in comparison to Tokyo Ghoul?\" Suppose it\u2019s a shrewd business manoeuvre, it\u2019s not like Tokyo Ghoul has any artistic integrity to preserve or risk losing at any rate.\\n\\n\r\n- Animation: 4.5/10 \u2013 objectively and technically speaking near average, not bad but not great either. But just not good enough especially considering other anime titles that will be commanding people\u2019s attention. My Hero Academia continues to knock the ball out of the park, and who else is very keenly aware that Tokyo Ghoul is trying to ride on the success of Attack on Titan. Tokyo Ghoul can\u2019t even claim to be a good filler anime until the time comes for fans of this genre, try being a good animation and build your own success by being a great series, free advice. \\n\r\nCertain chapters of the manga are drawn reasonably well and you would have thought the anime would reflect this, or make up for the not so great parts, but major spoiler alert: you thought wrong. Just to maim the manga even more, and also ensure that the studio has matured and tried to edit out the Emo feel of, like the whole cast, they even had Touka\u2019s haired dyed purple, not manga Goth black hair, \u201csee! See! It\u2019s OK for normal people to watch now!\u201d Says the studio, undoubtedly.\\n\r\nThe animation needed to be optimal for this reboot considering the dive off the deep end the second season (route A, which is now officially irrelevant with Re, which still can\u2019t clear up that travesty though) was, you would have thought the studio would really up their game with the animation to try and claw something back. Unfortunately, it\u2019s clear that the good folks were like \u201coh its Tokyo Ghoul, here\u2019s some basic stuff those weebs enjoy, they\u2019ll lap up anything.\u201d I do feel sorry for the fans, though it\u2019s telling what the studio really thinks of Tokyo Ghoul when the environments and backgrounds are\u2026 just why, what wicked, unforgivable actions have people done to deserve this?! The Twilight/Tokyo ghoul fans deserve sympathy for them having their hopes built up and presented with this, and especially with a Spring time anime this should be top notch regardless of what it is. In hindsight, it's perfectly feasible that the creators are in fact cats, who thought they were doing good and were expecting some praise when they came in with a horribly mangled mouse/Tokyo Ghoul animation. \\n\\n\r\n- Sound: don\u2019t even waste a rating/10 - sub fails to give emotions, anything at all to what should be an illustrative cast, as for the dub\u2026 just don\u2019t, got to spare you, it\u2019s too late for me, I\u2019m gone, save yourselves.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite obnoxious considering the Emo/Gothic niche that Tokyo ghoul is supposed to lay claim is now gone. The sound track could have been a great glue to cement that semi-unique status, the voice acting too. Honestly, it\u2019s not certain how they could have got it so\u2026 wrong, but lets be self aware here and realise Re is a \u201coh splat, there you go Tokyo Ghouls all done for now, time to move on to the next project, what do I care about this series.\u201d Not exactly reassuring, even for people who have moved on from this series but came back hoping there was something salvageable (I did want there to be something salvageable, I really did). \\n\r\nThey couldn\u2019t even have another cheese ball of an opening song. Whilst it\u2019s ridiculous, the male version of Twilight fans were all over the \u2018unravel\u2019 titular song from before, it reminds them of the dark times when their parents told them they have to stop dying their hair black and tidy their rooms, and they were the edgiest people alive, just ask them. But the songs here have failed to encapsulate the supposed atmosphere of Tokyo ghoul, and sound wise there\u2019s nothing notable to enjoy or remember. \\n\r\nA wasted opportunity in that sense, could have had music to match the tone of the series, but it is apparent this is a part of the white washing exercise to remove all traces of what fans liked from the start (must not forget the only golden rule of Tokyo Ghoul, the fans like something? It\u2019s removed; this evidently applied not just to the story courses and characters, but has carried over to even the music as well). It was a bit suspect but it\u2019s obvious now, we aren\u2019t imagining things, and perhaps the writer and studio really do loathe the fans, let go of the hate people, treat your fans right, they\u2019re the ones propping up this explosive train wreck of a show.\\n\\n\r\n- Homophobic undertones - (addressed) To its credit the glaring read between the lines prejudice articulated in the first manga have been acknowledged. It\u2019s clear that the following conversation took place between the publisher and author. Publisher: \u201cdude the whole Tsukiyama, Yamori, Nico, Souta ghoul villain thing is not subtle at all, son, people don\u2019t use the magical N-word man, or the coin grabbing greedy Jew, or the homosexual stereotypes any more, they weren\u2019t right then and they\u2019re not right now. And the whole ghoul culture as an allegory for LGBT culture, with those yucky ghouls/gays out to prey on one another, who don\u2019t have feelings for one another, who view each other as pieces of meat and only approach human/straight people to eat them/come onto them, someone will notice!\u201d And then the author, after he had stopped frothing at the mouth, nevertheless continued to chug beakers of mercury and proudly proclaimed: \u201cbut Tokyo Ghoul is perfect! In the first manga we had Kaneki catching the ghoul/gay disease AIDS from a blood transfusion! He doesn\u2019t have bad AIDS so it\u2019s cool right?\" The author is a machine, nothing stops this train. \\n\r\n\"And then! He goes over to see Tsukiyama for whatever purpose those gays/ghouls invite guys over for, (even showering before! I wonder what was going to happen?!) With the intention of having him torn apart for fun, and only spared because \u2018that guy\u2019 Tsukiyama wanted him for himself! After which Kaneki faints and wakes up on the sofa by himself, whatever occurred when he was unconscious and Tsukiyama was with him? What impression do you get?! What do you think I\u2019m trying to tell you?!\u201d Is or is not quite possibly the thoughts the author wants us to have.\\n\r\nThe author guides us through: \u201cTokyo Ghoul also explores Nishio struggling with his homosexual/ghoul desires but he rejects those foul urges and stayed with his girlfriend, a lady!\u201d The editor, or someone who wasn\u2019t totally clueless chimes in with \u201cthis is what happens when you don\u2019t take your meds! We get it! Tsukiyama and especially Nico were made with the express intention of prodding our vulnerable audience to react with \u201cyuck the horrible gays!\u201d and the writer, giddy with excitement demonstrates how subtle he is \u201cright! So after every arc being centrally themed around homosexuality (catching the gay/ghoul disease, Nishio inviting Kaneki and Hide, two guys back to his place where he makes his move when they\u2019re on their own, you know? Then predatory gay Tsukiyama who just loves the smell of Kaneki, and wants to cannibalize him, just like ghouls/gays just look at you and want to be around you for whatever.\" \\n\r\nRe continues in the same vein thought wise, this was after setting a foundation that Kaneki and the ghouls/gays can deny their carnal urges by drinking coffee, and resist their inner desires by being happily together with a member of the opposite sex, even when there\u2019s little compatibility between them (Nishio and his girlfriend, Kaneki and Touka, Akira is literally thrown at Amon). \\n\r\nThe homophobic bedrock Re is built upon will bring up the past, as the author helpfully explains: \u201cAfter that non stop parade, it\u2019s time to switch things up!\u201d Cue the daring stereotypes: Nico and Yamori, the latter who beats and kidnaps heterosexual Kaneki, after Yamori stabs Kaneki from behind with his kagune no less (can you see me ker wink) and then violates him (implied in the manga during the centipede scene) \u201cbecause that\u2019s what those awful gays/ghouls do of course! Not to mention that Kaneki learned his lesson not to approach those ghouls/gays, see Tsukiyama, but horror alert, they come and kidnap you and do what they do!\u201d The author gives it his all.\\n\r\nThe editor, noticing that the author\u2019s eyes had stopped rolling in opposite directions in his head must have said, \u201cJust like straight people, LBGT people are awesome, do some good now, introduce people to offset this demonizing behaviour\u201d to which the writer replies \u201cof course! I\u2019ll introduce a trans character but only because my hate infused homosexuals are horrible monsters apologue has been caught and my editor is making me do it.\u201d This is good, greater representation is sound, but clearly Mutsuki is the result of an editor\u2019s input rather than being present due to the writers choice, the latters views on LGBT+ people are clear, discreet as they were. \\n\r\nThe writer, having his homophobic anthem of stereotyped, crude prejudices called out, was strong armed into adapting his ways, with condescending attitudes such as: \u201cWe\u2019ll show that Naki does care about Yamori! See! Those yucky gays/ghouls can feel human emotions too! Who would have thought?!\u201d The author did try, and though Mutsuki has been introduced, these serious issues have not been remedied in Re. Souta, who is of course \u2018fabulous\u2019 because the author relishes his out-dated stereotypes from a bygone era, and of course the homosexuals have to be villains to be defeated. Re doesn\u2019t do much to bring this back from the brink, indeed, in terms of grossly odd biased views it goes further over the edge! \\n\\n\r\nNote: (spoiler for manga, and where Re has set the stage, and will no doubt be shown in the later episodes this year) with Hide\u2019s \u2018because I love him\u2019 comment, and with the commentary that came with Kaneki choosing Touka when fans wanted Hide (apparently Kaneki's mind was so severely damaged that he considers hat stand Touka to be the most beautiful person he's ever seen. To his credit when Arima wants to mangle someones brain, he does not mess around), first accept deepest sympathies for fans of either of these pairings. To begin with, Hide was taken out for largely the entire story, so much for that pairing, or indeed any exploration of what was clearly a special bond between Kaneki and Hide. Even Touka & Kaneki shippers have a poor guy who really needs some psychological help and decent friends and loved ones around him, matched with a physically and emotionally abusive literal side bit of a character, now demoted here to a non-tier character. Be nice to Tokyo Ghoul fans, with this anime and series they don\u2019t have much to be happy about, still the pairing options are a testament of how greatly Tokyo Ghoul can fail. \\n\r\nAs for Hide, the author\u2019s rabid disdain of LGBT people may be the greatest clue to the outcome. It\u2019s very subtle (lock me away for criminal sarcasm, and throw away the key) but the author is very keen to portray LGBT people as horribly as possible, whether because they\u2019re made to be all harsh stereotypes, or through what the author makes them do and the message is resolute: ghouls/LBGT people are truly bad, and this will reflect in the treatment the author has in store for them, including Hide.\\n\\n\r\nWe can infer that Hide is romantically attracted to Kaneki because of the appalling way that the author perceives and treats homosexual people. \\n\\n\r\nCan you imagine what the author thinks, and precisely what he wants his audience to deduce: \u201cHide is an amazing person in terms of friendship, bravery and skill, but behind that perfection he\u2019s one of those yucky queerosexuals, and that therefore stops him being good! Turn on your dear, precious friend and hate him now because you\u2019ve discovered he\u2019s gay!\u201d \\n\r\nThough Hide is a great character, (don't make the silly mistake of referring to a Tokyo Ghoul drawing as a \u2018person\u2019, Tokyo Ghoul manga and animation has not ever, and does not bring its text and drawings on paper to life) but because of Hide\u2019s sexual orientation he has to be relegated to a minor part in the entire series, his brief cameo on a \u2018missing\u2019 poster here says it all. Perish the thought that we can have a focus on those creatures now! But we can, only if there are negative depictions of homosexuals and have them represented badly, hence the myriad of characters like Nishio \u2013 \u2018struggling\u2019 with same sex/unnatural ghoul desire, and the crass steryotypes Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Furuta, more or less every arc baddy of the day. Re lets it's hair down by plummeting head first right back into the mire with newcomers Torso, the woman hater gay stereotype that was designed to not exactly be \u2018manly\u2019 and drawn to Mutsuki \u201cyou know when those type of people meet, wink wink, nudge nudge\u201d being the suggestion. There is also the man hating lesbian, Nutcracker, and of course the exaggerated super horrible villain of Big Madam. Big Madam, birth sex male, and the no contest parent of the year in raising Suzuya. Can you hear it? listen closely, it's there, guttural chanting from the deepest recesses of the earth: STAWP THOSE HOMOTRANSOSAPIENS! Must stop them adopting DUR children at all costs, look what they DOO!\" You can just about make out the token \"will someone PLEASE think about the children!\" The author delivers its hysterical, paranoid anti LGBT adoption audience a pristine example of why we can't allow LBGT adoption like ever. The author also walks the walk since Suzuya ends up dealing with that nasty awful LBGT caregiver, PHEW! Thank heavens! And then all the LGBT's were never allowed to adopt again, and the heavens opened up in a sea of sunshine and reclaimed rainbows, all thanks to Tokyo Ghoul's on point message.\\n\r\nIt's strangely awe inspiring how may blundering, degrading steryotypes of LBGT people the authors imagined, he's won every game of Bingo don't doubt it. The little rascals fervently, wackadoodle, maniacal prejudice drenched head must have been smoking as it went into overdrive to conjure the whole gang. Then there's the rest, Ghouls/gays in general are made to be horrible looking and acting, don\u2019t forget depicted in such a heartless and sadistic manner, wanting to eat human flesh? As unnatural and revolting as wanting to be with someone of the same sex is the presumed meaning. \\n\r\nThe deeply rooted prejudice the author exhibits untoward LGBT people extends to Uta and Yomo, both single and meant to provide a theist example of how like Nishio, those evil gays/ghouls can be redeemed by resisting their impulses. Yomo is likely meant to be perceived as \u2018the homosexual uncle\u2019 (\u201csee! Those homosexuals can be useful and they can be family! Praise me for my deep revolutionary message!\u201d) It was more so the case for Uta if the author is associating Emo\u2019s with homosexuals \u2018deviant\u2019 behaviour (which actually is the case in some cultures) and it\u2019s why they\u2019re given the time they\u2019re given for the reader to get this poisoned, do you notice the gamma radiation, see the real story message for the whole of Tokyo Ghoul. \\n\r\nThe author also lays a heavy handed \u2018code\u2019 essentially stating that: \u201cKaneki as a straight person can end up experiencing the ghoul/gay scene with all its misery and horror but ended up living happily ever after, delightfully married to a lady!\" Never mind that it\u2019s scrape the bottom of the barrel Touka, so long as it\u2019s something, anything with female parts. \\n\r\nMeanwhile his homosexual best friend Hide can look on from the side-lines because that\u2019s the place of homosexuals in this series. Even if they are good natured then they can\u2019t have main roles or happy endings, they exist to revolve around the straight protagonist. If Hide were heterosexual, wouldn\u2019t be a problem, can be back-to-back with Kaneki in the thick of the plot (the way Banjou was despite him not serving much purpose fighting, or story wise, but Banjou's straight so it's cool, don't you know). But not straight? Not allowed (was also applied to the nice natured Yomo), homosexuals don\u2019t get page/screen time in stories unless it\u2019s in a negative light, just in case Nishio, Tsukiyama, Nico, Yamori, Naki, Torso, Nutcracker, Big Madam, Souta and goodness knows who else, didn\u2019t give the game away. \\n\r\nThe author\u2019s pathological sickness concerning his mind set on homosexuals is only fully realised when we see what he has happen to Hide. If you were invested in this series, and we saw more of Hide we could actually emotionally react to the terrible maiming that occurred. We see that the poor guy has much of his mouth bitten off, teeth gone, neck severely damaged needing a voice synthesiser, the lot. The author really turned on Hide like some demented animal snapping and trying to murder it\u2019s own young after deciding Hide was that way. This was complete with the read between the lines message of \u201cthat horrific, life ruining scarring will teach Hide a lesson for trying to get close to Kaneki! Hope that teaches those homosexuals to try and kiss their friends! And kids! If you have someone who\u2019s gay and they try and kiss you/dare to show you affection, inflict that horrible injury on them too, gay panic defence nice and legal! The gays aren\u2019t your friends, they\u2019re horrible monsters out to eat you/show you affection, how awful!\u201d How awful indeed for the author to hold those toxic views, and to try and imprint them on an impressionable and resistless crowd. Make sure you\u2019re not duped, as tough as it is to resist this very convincing propaganda. \\n\r\nAdd to the fact that truly amazing people like his best friend Hide, a really nice guy, really clever, courageous, selfless, best of them all, that Hide was reduced to a plot device, had his lower face badly mutilated for everyone to see, just because he loves Kaneki, \u201cthat will teach those filthy gays, to be gay!\u201d (The author reinforces his concrete views by bringing Amon back, he too experienced the gay/ghoul treatment but like Kaneki he can be happily together with a woman, the ever bland Akira, oh how wonderful!... meanwhile the homosexuals/ghouls including the nice ones like Hide will end up with nothing, and that's if they\u2019re lucky). Says a lot that the heterosexual relationships, however contrived are meant to be considered nice, and distinguishes them to the homosexual ones, say Nico who was made by the author to just see Yamori as an attractive man nothing more, but that's how they think and act, get with the program already. The series is not a fan of happy endings for ghouls/gay people, just in case you couldn\u2019t tell.\\n\r\nOverall we may accept the authors treatment of ghouls/LBGT people as proof that Hide does indeed love Kaneki romantically because of what the author has diminished Hide to be. \\n\r\nEven their later reunion was to be superficially meaningless on another level, \u201coh hey best friend, always had my back, lost your face? Whatever I\u2019ve got Touka now, you\u2019re not a part of this story, still keep admiring the straight protagonist from over there, know your place now.\u201d Leave the author at his basement dungeon lair bending over and squirting Tokyo Ghoul out of all his seeping orifices into his braying fan army of hooting human rabbit dolls, it can\u2019t be any worse than this shoddy anime that was left behind.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul Re gets a mercy 1/10 in this area for doing something to alleviate the LGBT equivalent of all the black face racism of the past that is central to the first season. The presence of Mutsuki, better that than nothing. But as the points with \u2018camp\u2019 Souta, Tsukiyama whose entire life revolves around Kaneki, to 'eat' him no less, and now Torso, Nutcracker and Big Madam, and especially Hide as explained above, the prejudiced undertones, well overtones now remain a central pillar of this series, and are still in the sludge filled pipeline to come. \\n\r\nDon\u2019t be deceived though, or lose heart, with the story, animation, the travesty of the cast, and now this, scraping Tokyo Ghoul off your boot is easy. The author can rest soundly, resolutely secure in the knowledge that he has completely and utterly failed to turn me against LBGT people. That one can immediately identify Tokyo Ghoul as not a thinly veiled jab at LGBT people, but correctly recognise this as the LBGT equivalent of some sort of crafted propaganda demonising Jewish people using crass stereotypes and behaviours. It can be viewed right now the same way we look at old racist Disney cartoons, interesting being modern, ancient history let's give it that. And appealing to the audiences suspension of disbelief to accept what is shown them, to be able to see through it all is a good skill for the audience to have. \\n\r\nDespite the major league, full throttle conditioning (subconsciously moulding the reader to think these are the issues the ghouls/gays face, keep away from them, see how horrible they look/are, virtually every villain is some variation of a LBGT stereotype, don\u2019t worry the good straight people all make it, but even the nice LGBT examples like Hide have to have the hammer fall on them) and the normalisation of extreme preconceptions this series espouses, Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s efforts must prove to be futile, it would not be wise to drink from this radioactive lagoon. And though Re continues to be the must have quintessential tool for some lobotomised fear monger to illustrate how ghoul society and how all the awful villains are supposed to represent LGBT people and how detestable they are, it can fail to lay a claim to our views. For the real overarching villain isn't the LGBT/ghouls, their society or the humans, not Arima, Eto or Furuta, the true villain is well hidden within plain sight. Hint, it's in the form of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, animation, the series itself, and the foul hateful anti LGBT message it champions. \\n\\n\r\n- Summary - Deserves some praise because Re does actually somehow manage to be worse than both previous seasons, no easy feat considering the state they were in. Re was supposed to make it all better but it doesn\u2019t. It could have righted the wrongs done before but it didn\u2019t. Though there is an intuition that suspects this was done to be spiteful, not just to the fan base, but casual viewers as well (the \u2018My Little Pony\u2019 creator mocked bronies, the cast of the \u2018Twilight\u2019 movies look down on the subject material and fans, and it\u2019s evident here that both the author and animation studio are repulsed by the Emo/Goth fan base of Tokyo Ghoul and are trying to shake them off). They also need hugs and whatever it takes therapy wise to cleanse them of their serious wrangle against LBGT people, don\u2019t worry though who\u2019s gullible enough to absorb anything from Tokyo Ghoul, right? It can't even patronise the viewer with some cutesy \"look Mom, I figured out gays/ghouls have feelings too just like us!\" Can we all agree to be beside our precious LGBT friends and family and disown the broken homophobes that had an accident on their failed expedition to the toilet and violently discharged Tokyo Ghoul? We can train them to be better, we\u2019ll be that good.\\n\r\nAdditionally, Re does have a remarkable penchant for resetting the established narrative, characters and repeating the exact same events with a deux ex machine memory loss, so they can parrot entire events but with the protagonist as a detective this time, complete with new rusty old forgettable clich\u00e9 characters as a bonus, whoop! \\n\r\nThis anime, in terms of plot, characters, animation, premise, everything is dull, and subpar, though nothing does dull and subpar like Tokyo Ghoul, and Re has taken that to a brand new, unprecedented tier of defective. Sorry guy versions of Twilight fans, and the Emo crowd, I actually am, for the author to cut his fan base loose, and for this series to plummet to ever greater depths must be hard, my condolences, though finding something good and leaving the series behind to wallow in it\u2019s own squalid filth takes nothing, that\u2019s for certain.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall verdict: negative points/10 \u2013 unworthy of your viewership or time, people are waking up and recognising Tokyo Ghoul as the \u2018Twilight\u2019 manifestation of anime. Identifying the male version of Twilight fans, who can see Bella and Kaneki in abusive, fake relationships with certainly no love, in no story, characters, everything is appallingly dire, why go on. Let\u2019s acknowledge that land fills like Twilight and Tokyo Ghoul may have their fans, but that does not mean that they are good. Tokyo Ghoul is a block so shockingly deficient and worthless from a literary and personal enjoyment perspective, yet under propped up by\u2026 really nice people. \\n\r\nUnderstand It\u2019s Ok for you to feel let down by this latest soiled diaper unto our fair earth; at this point what\u2019s important to note is that no you did not deserve this, and no it is definitely not your fault, you done NOTHING wrong to warrant this animation. Tokyo Ghoul Re was supposed to be everything to make up for the previous seasons, indeed the manga itself but, it just didn\u2019t want to, or couldn\u2019t. \\n\r\nThe problem is ingrained with the manga source material itself; it was already a fail by concept, character and story premise, had a reset in Re but repeated the exact same mistakes but to an even greater extent. To result in this animated abomination is an absolute travesty of our time. Try as you might you simply cannot polish excrement. You can strive to apply a glossy concealment but you can\u2019t disguise the material that lurks underneath and forget about containing the rancid stench. You can give Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s manga a shiny, well\u2026 at least not an eye exploding, hideous anime adaption, but the gloop within cannot be covered for long. And for all the production values, sound and animation, they sink into the heap that is Tokyo Ghoul. The good features on board go down with the ship. Whether it\u2019s the point blank refusal to center on the appealing characters (of which there are fewer in Re) or ignore decent plot options, to choose the exact same boring story, again, Re cannot trip over the hurdles enough and repeatedly. \\n\r\nBasic animation and voice acting can apply a cover, but what type of awful veneer is this anime? In hindsight the studio done the best with what they had to work with, and the weary and uninspired result is far from pretty. That they made a hippo mess failure of an anime, which should be safely disposed of, is actually a compliment considering the state of the actual manga. \\n\\n\r\nCasual viewers will likely have zero interest in the anime equivalent of an almost B-movie both in terms of the actual animation, sound and characters. Little here stands out, if you like police/detective stuff, find something that\u2019s worth it, this will leave you hanging. \\n\r\nPerhaps the fans can hope for an entire wipe the slate clean anime reboot, to properly polish out the swan dive to the bottom that route A was, and now this is. It happened with Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood and that was astonishing, fingers crossed Tokyo Ghoul can also be redone and done as right as can be. Some people cling to anime to feel nice, that's fine, whatever makes them happy. Tokyo Ghoul, however is a life jacket made out of lead, a parachute that when opened is revealed to in fact be an anvil. Be decent and chuck people a bone here.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of dire, boring characters, uninspired dull plots, and always opting for the poorer choices instead of the enriching ones, nothing does it like Tokyo Ghoul. It may always be resented for choosing the worst when it could be the best, and the direction the whole dilapidated series took is a pale inferior shade of what it could have been. \\n\r\nRe has once again used it\u2019s tried and tested, super delicious recipe of baking a cake using ultra fresh cat vomit instead of flour, malevolent hobo droppings rather than icing, a choice collection of plague rat fur and tapeworm eggs for sprinkles, and who needs a cherry garnish when Tokyo Ghoul opts for a sublime bloated, fully loaded prolapsed rectum on top. The animation proceeded to make a malodorous finger paint, cave scribble with infected menstrual blood, savour Tokyo Ghoul to your hearts content, party people.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, If you\u2019re a fan of Tokyo Ghoul make sure you watch this anime, it\u2019s such a good adaption, you\u2019ll be really happy, and it will be so worth it, and you\u2019ll love it so, so much : )",

            "content": "Don't watch this anime.\r\nWhether or not you've read the manga, you'll be extremely disappointed by this mess of an adaptation. As someone who's been with :re from chapter one, I'm actually appalled by how horrible this anime is.\r\nThe story, although enjoyable in this part of the anime, is extremely rushed. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pacing, and at first I excused it, thinking they'd fix it by episode two, since the first episode tends to have weird pacing. But no, we're at episode five now and nothing has changed. Nothing is fleshed out, the interactions are rushed, and because of this, therelationships between characters seem forced and fake.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is what you'd come to expect by a Tokyo Ghoul anime. I didn't mind the original's animation as much, but I have to point out that the animation is as boring and tasteless as A1 Pictures's. No fluid movement, rushed, boring, and so many frames look dumb and wonky, I can't help but rush. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the ending song a lot, considering I'm already a huge Queen Bee fan, and have mixed feelings about the opening. The music in the show is nothing to write home about- mostly just some weird synth beats that were made with no inspiration. It feels lackluster and boring and it really is. I feel like the performances of the voice actors are amongst the worst they've done, especially Natsuki Hanae's portrayal of Haise, which sounds stiff and really forced. I'm also extremely angry they decided to use a higher-pitched female voice actor for Mutsuki.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the same as the manga, but are, as mentioned before, much less fleshed out. Can't say much here.\\n\\n\r\nI've been with :re since the beginning of its serialization, and what a shitfest it's been. These first three books are my favorite, and have a special place within my heart (yes, the anime got through volumes one through three in five episodes). But I can't say I enjoy this anime at all. I love Haise, so I enjoy seeing him, but other than that, I can't find myself looking forward to the episodes every week.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a three out of a ten. I'll most likely lower it.",

But the most damaging flaw was that it focused more on action than the story, world and characters.\\n\r\n-Tokyo Ghoul (anime) (Season 1) Score: 3/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Season 2 titled \"Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA\" (Pronounced: Root A), on the other hand, was an anime-original storyline that featured some story elements from the manga but painted in a different light. All of which was spun the original creator of Tokyo Ghoul: Sui Ishida. So what went wrong here? The answer was simple, the story was beyond disjointed, confusing and made no sense, the characters were basically pointless and the whole thing overall felt like a bastardization and betrayal of Tokyo Ghoul and worst of all, remember when I said Sui Ishida made the entirety of \u221aA story? well the worst thing was that Studio Pierrot (The studio making T.G to begin with) pretty much threw Ishida's storyboards and drafts into the dirt and outright disrespected his work, granted they also did that with Season 1 but it's much more noticeable here and overall though, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA was REALLY BAD and no one, whether Manga Reader or Anime Watcher, should EVER waste their time with this at all.\\n\r\n-Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA (Season 2) Score: 1/10-\\n\\n\r\nSo then, when I heard that Tokyo Ghoul was getting a 3rd Season was never looking forward to this whatsoever. Later on, witnessed more and more of the anime being showcase I was still never impressed but what I saw and even though it was sticking to the manga this time, like Season 1, but with no recap or anything didn't make matters any better and it seemed like Studio Clown didn't learn their lesson after all. Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) gave me the impression that it was going to be on autopilot for the entire stay and you know, THAT'S a perfect description for it.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is the official 3rd Season of the Tokyo Ghoul anime series, \"adapted\" (adapted in Massive Quotes there and use that term very, VERY loosely) from the manga of the same name: Tokyo Ghoul:re (manga) which is a sequel series to the original series: Tokyo Ghoul (manga) which all done by the mangaka: Sui Ishida.\\n\\n\r\n---Story: 3/10---\\n\r\n----DISCLAIMER: In order to avoid confusion for Anime Only Watchers, Listen up. This season is not connected to Season 2 whatsoever in anyway, shape or form. It is a continuation of the events that transpired in the manga. So in other words, Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA IS COMPLETELY WORTHLESS!!!!----\\n\r\nSet 2 years after the events of the original manga (Read the manga, the light novels and [Jack] to fully understand those said events), Tokyo has changed drastically due the influence of the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), however ghouls themselves still pose has a problem to them especially the terrorist organization: Aogiri Tree (Read the manga to know who they are) as such, the CCG has decided to start up a brand new project by created their own set of Ghoul Investigators comprised of Half-Human, Half-Ghoul Hybrids (Well, more human than ghoul to be honest, but again read the manga to fully understand) known as the \"Quinx Squad\" (or \"Quinx\" or just \"Qs\" for short) in order to fight off the ghouls while being led by their mentor, Rank 1 Ghoul Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is) who has mysteriously suffered from amnesia as he can't seem to remember 20 years of his past life. (Again. He is EXACTLY who you think he is).\\n\r\n-Anyways, despite the fact that this show is \"adapting\" Volumes 1-5 of the manga into 12 Episodes (Just like Season 1), it doesn't excuse the fact that the story and overall writing for the was just straight-up flimsy, unlike its original source material, this isn't a deep story and there's literally nothing here. A MASSIVE amount of story felt like it was removed (and that's because it is). A lot of moments and element from the manga have been completely removed and changed and what was \"adapted\" from the manga even I knew they would screw up at, so any tension, character development, lasting impact and even symbolism is entirely removed. But on top of that, for Anime Only Watchers, they're going to get EXTREMELY confused when they watch this show because they won't know what's going on here and to make things even worse the show starts off as if everyone knows about what happened previously....NOT A GOOD SIGN and also LITERALLY NOTHING is ever explained and the whole thing feel completely rushed, even more so than Season 1. Seriously, though did the writer just fall asleep or just not give a shit?.....But anyways, I'm not gonna put too much energy into this simply because not much energy felt like it was placed into this. Tokyo Ghoul........could be enjoyable as its on anime series but with an anime series like this you can never really tell sometimes. However, if we're allowed to go back to that early comment I made about Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) feeling like it's on autopilot....I wasn't just talking about the story....-\\n\\n\r\n---Characters: 3/10---\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly comprised of returning characters like Kishou Arima, Akira Mado, Touka Kirishima, Juzou Suyuza, Hinami Fueguchi, Ayato Kirishima, so on and so forth and new characters like Karao Saeki, Miza Kusakari and of course, the Ouinx Squad: Rank 2 Investigator: Kuki Urie, Rank 3 Investigator: Ginshi Shirazu, Rank 3 Investigator: Tooru Mutsuki, Rank 3 Investigator: Saiko Yonebayashi and finally our protagonist: the amnesic Rank 1 Investigator: Haise Sasaki (Who is EXACTLY who you think he is). While all of this may sound like good idea on paper, it's terribly executed in practice because none of the characters both old and new aren't really that interesting most of them are either undermined, uninteresting or just flat out unlikable with no rhyme or reason. Most of the character's personal motivations make absolutely no sense and it leave you scratching your head wondering why any of what they're doing is happening in the 1st place and none of their actions at all make any sense. Which is left a very empty feeling. In fact, the characters are just there for the sake of being there. (Seriously, the manga got the characters right so what's this show's excuse?). Also, one more THE OPENING SPOILED THE ENTIRE SHOW'S PLOT. I MEAN, WTF!?!?!\\n\\n\r\n---Art & Animation: 2/10---\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot is once again making Tokyo Ghoul and this time around they're not even trying. The art and visual style is a massive downgrade compared to Season 1, \u221aA and even the manga for the matter. Everything looked extremely cheap from the environments to the character design everything just looks half-assed and color palette looked completely muted, almost like the studio's ink cartridges ran out of ink and forgot to go resupply at the office depot. Seriously, Season 1 at least looked like it had some effort placed into it. The animation is some of the worse the series has ever produced it's completely stiff, unnatural and empty and overall nothing is really impressive in anyway, I mean, Good God even the action scenes suck, the action in the show in is barely any actual movement but it instead a bunch of still frames and slideshows that you can easily make in Mircosoft Powerpoint as a mid-term project. Sometimes there are a few times where the visual are pretty nice but still though overall, this is just not a pretty show to look at. Also, Touka once again has Purple Hair when in the manga she has Black Hair and later in early :re she has Light Blue Hair.....I mean, WTF!!!\\n\\n\r\n---Sound:9/10---\\n\r\nIf there's always one actual good thing about the previous 2 Seasons was the GORGEOUS Soundtrack and Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is no different. Yutaka Yamada once again returns as the composer for Tokyo Ghoul (anime)'s soundtrack and it's just as amazing as ever and it's overall fits the overall themes of Tokyo Ghoul, sporting some great piano and techno pieces and some amazing vocal tracks. As for the Opening and Ending Songs, Tokyo Ghoul (anime) has always had amazing songs as Unravel by TK from Ling Tosite Sigure, Munou (Incompetence) by \u00f6sterreich (which I'm might by the only one who actually did like the song) and Seasons Die One After Another by amazarashi (The only song I did like was The Saints by People in the Box because I thought it was pretty dull). For Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) the songs this time around are: asphyxia by C\u00f6 shu Nie and HALF by queen bee and both songs are really incredible and fit very well with the early stages of Tokyo Ghoul:re. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Voice Acting, the Japanese Voice Acting and the fit their individual characters quite I especially did like the performances of Natsuki Hanae, Kaito Ishikawa, Yuma Uchida, Natsumi Fujiwara, Ayane Sakura, Yu Kobayashi, Daisuke Namikawa, Takahiro Sakurai and Mamoru Miyano as Haise Sasaki/Ken Kaneki, Kuki Urie, Ginshi Shirazu, Tooru Mutsuki, Saiko Yonebayashi, Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, Kishou Arima, Uta and Shu Tsukiyama respectively. Overall, the Japanese Voice Acting is overall really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe English Voice Acting, on the other hand, was pretty weak none of the performances impressed me in anyway and voices themselves range from just fine, to boring or in the case of Daman Mills as Ginshi Shirazu just plain awful. On top of the almost none voices don't fit very well the characters themselves with only 3 expectations: J. Micheal Tatum as Shu Tsukiyama, Brittany Lauda as Miza Kusakari and Jeannie Tirado as Karren/Kanae von Rosewald, while I could've gone without the German accent but I think it kinda works. But still, I never did watched the previous 2 Seasons in English beforehand but if this seasons English Dub is anything to go by then I dodged a bullet I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The soundtrack is once again absolutely amazing as ever and it's easily the single good thing from this show. As for the voice acting, this is the very 1st anime series where I prefer the Japanese over the English, so I really won't recommend the English Dub.\\n\\n\r\n---Verdict---\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re (anime) just its predecessors is the living definition of misused potential, like I said earlier, Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) is basically on autopilot from beginning, middle to end. This show is going back to \"adapting\" the manga like the 1st Season but like that Season Pierrot's means of doing so are means of subtraction of designs, themes, characters, core mechanics, story elements everything feels lesser here. If anyone are fans of the manga or otherwise DO NOT watch Tokyo Ghoul:re (anime) and the previous 2 Seasons, there's no excuse for such a sloppy execution as an adaptation of the manga: it fails, as an anime series on its own: there are so many better options. If you like anime as much as the next guy or girl, Don't bother wasting your time with this series (and read the manga). Black Clover offered a better experience than this although I'd easily recommend My Hero Academia, Full Metal Alchemist, DARLING in the FRANXX and Citrus way above that show.\\n\\n\r\n~HERE'S HOPING TO A REBOOT FOR THE ANIME!!!~",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re is a highly misunderstood anime. Manga readers condemn it for its rushing of the plot; anime-onlys enjoy it for its fresh storyline and decent action. To enjoy TG:re to the max, you have to find a balance between these two common opinions by acknowledging that the anime and manga are two different entities that should be viewed - and enjoyed - separately. \r\nIshida is a phenomenal storyteller. There are a plethora of brilliant scenes that you can tell have been crafted perfectly and could not be any better. For instance, while the overall drive of the plot felt rushed and unnecessarily accelerated insome aspects, the focus on Haise regaining his memories was designed and paralleled perfectly with the original Tokyo Ghoul series; it made me feel nostalgic over Ken Kaneki's tragic tale. (\"If you were to write a story with me in the lead role, it would certainly be a tragedy.\") The only criticism of the story, for me, would be the rushing of the plot (and in the process) ignoring certain scenes from chapters that add to the atmosphere of the series. However, as previously mentioned, it is my belief that an anime and manga should be enjoyed - or hated - separately, in order to get the most out of it. \\n\\n\r\nSome people hold the opinion that the animation is lacking in particular departments. This could be referring to the action scenes, the character stills, and/or the overall art. It is true that during some action scenes, the animation could have done with a new animator. In fact, the reason as to why some animated scenes flumped is because the anime was outsourced, which means that different studios work on different episodes, so quality can, and often will, vary from episode to episode. In spite of this, it is important to remember that TG:re and TG are not action-driven works (shounen) - they are, without a doubt, character-focused stories. Even more so, I personally prefer the new colour tint and animation style when it comes to the still scenes. Especially when Haise was the main focus on the screen - he looked fucking great. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its superb soundtrack. During the original TG, we were blessed with the work of art commonly known as 'Unravel'. Its closing soundtrack, written by the J-Rock band 'people In The Box' didn't fall behind the legacy of unravel much further, either. Ignoring the atrocity of the second season and its horrendous soundtrack, the opening song to TG:re, Asphyxia (written by Co Shu Nie) is almost as angelic as unravel. Some fans even prefer thus opening to its first, perhaps because of the chaotic buzz and fervent energy it installs in you as you watch and headbang to it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that distinguishes TG from other anime is its ability (or rather, Sui Ishida's) to construct groundbreaking characters that you can't help but adore to watch. Whether her is Haise or Kaneki, I love this character as if he were my child. Not to mention the warm and fulfilling relationship between the QS members, which is something worthy of a prize itself. But in relation to Haise/Kaneki, this character glowed brighter than any other character so far, as he does in every season he is in - because that is the final product of Ishida's hard work and spectacular storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, TG:re is a fantastic addition to the series. Now that the manga is coming to a close, the anime successfully provides its fans with the chance to fill their empty hearts as they wait - and beg - for another manga series in the future. As a whole, it is a work of art when you look at it from an outsider's perspective and refrain frm comparing it to the manga as an abundance of fans like to. Either way, if you read the manga or not, it is highly likely that you will find yourself enjoying the anime adaptation of TG:re, and hopefully, like me, end up adoring it. \\n",

            "content": "You're probably wondering whether or not I'm being serious about such a low score. Long story short, yes this show is really that bad. Frankly, at times I couldn't believe my eyes while watching this. I hope that after reading this review you'll see just how bad this show is yourself. \r\nSTORY\r\nNow, at that point most reviewers would recap the plot of the show, albeit in very broad terms to avoid spoilers and such. But here's the problem: this show has no plot. None. A thing happens, the characters respond to it, then they fight it out. Rinse and repeat. This has been a formulafor the second season as well, and surely enough it's back this season with no changes to it being done.\\n\r\nIt doesn't go anywhere, and even if character arcs are present, there's still no sign of an overarching narrative to tie them all together. Any story, in its essence can be divided into the beginning, the middle and the end. While Tokyo Ghoul certenaly had a beginning, we don't have a slightest idea if it progresses anywhere. The episodes feel disjointed and abrupt, pacing is all over the place. That is, however, the least of my problems with the series and this season in particular. Moving on to the \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the previous section I can at least say something about the characters of this show. While many of them are underdeveloped and bare-bones, it's definately the strongest aspect of the show. And by strongest I mean it's not completely abscent or all around terrible. \\n\r\nBefore talking about individual characters I want to adress by far the most outrageous aspect of the show. A lot of the episodes feature characters that were never introduced, but treated by the show like they have been, or like they matter. An episode can literally start with characters framed like we're supposed to care about them or at the very least know them. A lot of them end up dying dramatically, even though the viewer couldn't possibly have cared. I even ended up rewatching the previous episodes' endings to make extra sure I didn't miss an episode or two on accident. I didn't. I don't know if that's because half of the episodes got cut out from the show, or because the writers expect the viewers to be familliar with the source material or any other reason, it's simply unforgivable. With that out the way, let's talk about some of the more prominent characters. \\n\r\nThe Main Protagonist -- Is it even a spoiler to just call him Kaneki rather than Haise? I mean it was obvious from the start. And yet I don't feel like calling him by his real name. Why? Because Ken Kaneki is not even a character. They change him up, seemingly at will every single season, to the point where his name doesn't belong to any character. Kaneki from season one and Haise from season 3 are two completely diffirent characters, no matter what the writers want you to believe. Haise himself is incredibly dull, he lacks a character arc and prominent traits, unless caring for his friends a lot counts as one. You knew what was gonna happen to him, I knew what was gonna happen to him, so he really lacks any sort of hook. This guy is really hard to care about on any level. \\n\r\nUrie -- he's the best character this season, but once again, \"the best\" as in not entirely dull or boring. He has a character arc, complete with a motivation and a goal. Sure, it's all basic, but it exists and I have to commend the effort. His only gimminck of being an egoistical hypocrite still gets old very fast. \\n\r\nSaiko -- the token loli. She's listed as the main character in on the title page, but doesn't do anything. She can usually be found playing vidya or running around aimlessly with that big goofy-looking hammer. She's hinted to have an amazing power, but when she does it, it's kinda meh. \\n\r\nTooru -- no idea if it's a guy or a gal, either way had a lot of time devoted to him in the beginning of the season, only to be entirely forgotten about in the end. \\n\r\nShirazu -- the opposite of Tooru. Had nothing going for him at the beginning, only to rapidly develop a storyarc near the end. His only piece of characterization is having shark teeth.\\n\r\nJuuzou -- I'm only talking about him because he was my favorite character of the second season by far. Not only was he the only character to feature a proper arc and any sort of nuance to him, he also wasn't too boring in a fight. However, that was the last season (whitch was almost as bad as this one by the way). Here, Juuzou is a dissapointment, honestly. They skipped his character development to its conclusion, and so this season nothing happens to him. Even his fights have gotten boring.\\n\r\nShuu -- absolutely irrelevant as a character, despite having a hude arc of his own. I don't really get why I'm supposed to care about anything that's happening to him, he was never even likable to begin with. Since his very first appearance in season one, he wasn't shown to have a single redeeming quality as a character. \\n\r\nWell, that about covers most of the relevant ones, now onto the reason I can't see anyone ever enjoying this show: \\n\\n\r\nFIGHTS AND ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nEvery action-driven anime lives and dies by the execution of its fight scenes. And by execution I mean everything in them, not just choreography and animation. Nontheless, if I had to start somewhere, I'd start with animation in general. It's all over the place, ranging from being legitimately not bad in some fighting scenes to being insulting in more somber moments. The low point to me was in episode 3 or 4, where, durning a conversation, animators used shot-reverse shot in such a way, that the speaking characters' mouth would not be visible. When it was their turn to talk, we'd only see their back, and not their face. I wish I was kidding. That being said, when the action heated up, the animation sometimes followed suit, for the more important battles. And that would even be sort of fun to watch, if not for two reasons: \\n\r\nFirstly, I had a hard time caring about any of the characters because of the reasons described in the previous section. And even without that, I couldn't enjoy the action at the most basic level because, secondly, there was no stakes. Let me elaborate. The ghoul powers are basically never put in any sort of easy to understand but concrete enough to follow bounds. Because of that, the viewer is never sure what's dangerous and what's not. At the writer's whim any hit can hurt the characters badly, or be completely ignored by them. \\n\r\nIs a gaping hole in your abdomen bad? What about being sliced in half? There are no answers to that. It's unknown just how much can the characters endure before going down, so you can't even follow the battles from that perspective. Some can die from a fairly normal looking wound, some can withstand being dismembered. You never know, so naturally, you never care.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, I couldn't even enjoy watching this show just to laugh at how bad it was, like I can with some other ones. It was a chore all the way through. I can't, with good faith, recommend this show to anyone.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the sound was kind of alright, the OP was even good at times.",

            "content": "I am going to be reviewing Tokyo Ghoul:Re as purely an anime and judge it based on its merits as simply that. Not some appendage meant to supplement its source material. This has been my approach when viewing seasons 1 and 2, which is why I enjoyed them for the most part (to the dismay of manga readers). Who knows? Coming in as a blank slate probably made it slightly easier for me to enjoy them. The world we were introduced to was lucid and well-established right from the first episode of season 1. The story was elaborate and well-paced, the character dynamics and relationshipswere complex. The voice acting was emotionally laden and three dimensional. The music was superb and probably the best part of both seasons. While the animation, though tolerable, was possibly the weakest aspect. All in all, season 1 was a great watch and season 2 was not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think I would\u2019ve been overjoyed by TG:Re based on how I felt about its predecessors. And I was when it was announced. I stayed away from the manga for good measure here as well, so as to stay open minded just in case they opted for some creative liberties. Pointless. Tokyo Ghoul:Re was just difficult for me to watch... Part of why this was the case for me is that I kept convincing myself that it would get better. That somewhere in the episodes to come the writers would get on their feet and find their stride, that the studio was still setting us up for one huge payoff mid series. Just something. I kept making excuses to keep from losing interest and filling my head with as many excuses as I could conjure up until all that hope dissipated and I was left to confront my denial and convince myself that season 3 was a betrayal that should never have even happened. Everything that I loved about the first two was gone. They stripped it, left it unrecognizable and with nothing for it to stand on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNever mind that I didn\u2019t know where Kaneki had gone much less that he was still the lead of this series lodged in there somewhere, or what happened to all the other members of Anteiku and why Hinami wasn\u2019t a part of it anymore. It didn\u2019t take me long to figure out that the narrative had shifted and that the story would continue to unfold from the perspective of the CCG and its mish mash of new albeit incompetent faces. The story ran amok with no discernible direction. \\n\\n\r\nWith so much ground work laid from previously, it looked like none of that mattered here. It felt like a reboot more than anything else, but what really infuriated me was how it acted like we would somehow carry all that emotional package that season 1 and \u221aA worked hard to build in its audience and adapt it to an unfamiliar setting with a landscape of characters we don\u2019t even know let alone care about. It doesn\u2019t take the time to establish any of its characters or why they mean what they do to one another and by extension, the viewer. When you have a death take place and you want it to elicit an emotional response from me but instead you get a \u201cwhat on God\u2019s beautiful earth is going on here?\u201d then you ought to know that you lost a good moment to score points with me. Little two-minute flashbacks before killing someone off with the background characters watching in horror and disbelief doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to follow suit. You legitimatelyscrewed up. If you\u2019re going to start from scratch with a whole new palette of characters to kill off no matter how much I want you to win, emotional reactions are earned.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was another culprit that emptied this show of any evidence that I am on this show's side. It was so bad it made the voice acting seem awful. I know for a fact that the fault was in the writing because I looked up the cast and all of them are very capable voice actors with extensive work much of it laudable. These are all talented people who know what their doing if given decent material to work with. And no amount of talent could save it, unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nBut the music, of everything else that was done horribly wrong was the one biggest assault against the body of work that got me interested in the anime. I was shocked to learn that Yutaka Yamada composed the score here. He scored the previous seasons and did an amazing job of elevating even the most mediocre scenes and turning them into something to reflect on while holding back tears. Nothing akin to that here. This was the laziest score I\u2019ve ever heard since the decline of Hans Zimmer in Hollywood. Even Yamada was utterly uninspired by the events of TG:Re. He has unapologetically done away with the sophisticated symphonies that accentuated the mood of first two seasons. His \u201ccompositions\u201d here are, as if in protest, simple synth beats just as hollow as everything else about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was never Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s strongest factor, but with nothing else going for it, it seems to me to be unwise to lower your standards at that as well. The character designs were pretty basic with faces constructed from rudimentary shapes meant for colour in books. The action sequences are the notorious one frame movements that don\u2019t spark any tension. They don\u2019t feel even mildly exciting or rewarding in the few places they have been sprinkled in. They look like an afterthought of some sort much like the music.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted this show to be good. I believed what was done before it was a work of art that though wasn\u2019t flawless, was honest in its intentions to take us on an adventure. I have vehemently defended the anime against its own manga fans for years but I can\u2019t stand behind this and still claim to be an anime fan. I stand on the side of art that showcases passion. Whether it stays true to the source or not is immaterial to me personally. The effort just has to be there. I don\u2019t know what this was, sadly. I just couldn\u2019t recognize any of this. But what I could spot could be summed up in one word: Lazy.",

            "content": "This is perfect example how to totaly bungle the sequel. I seen previous seasons of Tokyo Ghul and I can't still belive this is possible to create such poor continuation.\r\nLet's start with the plot - to begin with I am not a manga reader so as avarage viewer all my infromations come from previous seasons.\r\nTo be honest first season was something \"fresh\", well made with very good soundtrack and composition. Tokyo ghul was touching some interesting and important topics as \"what is bad\" and \"who is bad\" and all dilemma related to being a ghul. \r\nSecond season was also well made but I felt abit lost there. Whole anime was from very different perspective - everything was mixed and many actions of characters didn't make any sense but still that was something decent.\\n\r\nAs the first season I rated [9] and second [8], this one deserves hard [5] and this is why:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all I have completely no idea what is happening and more importantly - why. Third season starts with completely new environment, characters + main character can't remember his past so he is totaly different person and [whoa!] this time he is the one who fights ghuls. \\n\r\nThe worst thing in this mess is the fact that in previous seasons we had some kind of \"balance\" between bad and good ghuls/people but this time we recived simple 2 facts:\\n\r\n- ghuls are bad because they are bad. (even tho they are acting good)\\n\r\n- humans are good because they are. (although they are actually acting like villains)\\n\r\nThis time there are no questions why they are bad or good. It's just a fact.\\n\r\nMoreover whole climate of first and second seasons has been changed to completely idyll world with some \"ghul problems\". The fun thing is that the show still tries to be serious but it just can't be taken serious with whole crap we can see on the screen becasue after seeing the first episode we know where exactly this show is going.\\n\\n\r\nThe second great problem are motives of characters and behaviour. \\n\r\nNo one. None of the new characters is likeable. They have no good motives, stupid past and in overall they are just not interesting or even retareded. I have got feeling like they have the same knownlage of what they are doing in this show as me who watch it. As addition we can see some characters from previous series like group commanders and other \"soldiers of peace\" and they only exists to die in the fight.\\n\\n\r\nIf it comes to fight - in general half of this show is some kind of battle but fights looks sooo poor and avarage that you can see better fight scenes by opening very random anime from genre 'school life' or 'sport'. \\n\r\nBassicaly, fights looks like showing key scenes, effects of fight so in result we get constatly scenes aka \"I penetrated you with my kagune N-th time\" or \"I strangle you 10th time but you still don't die\". By the way very strange thing is current balance between ghuls and humans. Single random ghul can be easly killed now by some strange not-kagune weapon aka sword not to metion it can block few big kagune and ... I just don't understand what happened during last 2 years.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I want to mention is soundtrack and art. As the the first season came with great piece of music and decent art then this time I have to say we are attacked by medicore or very bad looking backgrounds and animation. Quality of TG:re is not so bad itself but compositon and animation parts of it is so bad executed, its not comparable to previous seasons. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs summary, this is probably the worst execution of sequel I have ever seen in my life. This show can't be compared to previous seasons in any terms. Simply speaking Tokyo ghul:re completely eliminated all good aspects of this series making it bad animated, poor, avarage sh*t show.",

This season achieved the impossible, by somehow being even worse than the second season. \r\nStory : 1\r\nThe pacing in this season is absolutely dreadful. From the get-go, you already have no idea on what is going on. It is revealed that Kaneki has lost his memories and is now living as a different person.

While it looks great and has some great fights, TG:re is confusing and frustrating. I don't know where my season 1 tokyo ghoul storyline went, but I missit.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main new themes introduced in TG:re are the \"quinx\" members of the CCG, who are introduced out of nowhere. While there are a few info dumps that try to explain this dramatically new direction where the CCG is actually using half-ghouls as weapons, it isn't satisfactory. Each of the quinx members have their own slice of backstory to justify their existence, but there isn't enough depth. Maybe it's because the cast has grown way too large, and because adding 4 new main characters isn't going to work in 12 episodes...\\n\\n\r\nThe most egregious mistake was the way they handled Haise. Although I feel that the manga readers have a better understanding of what's going on, as a show watcher I was only able to vaguely understand what he is halfway through the season. And if Haise did the fusion dance with Kaneki, what about Rize who's supposed to be part of Kaneki's body? From what I remember, she never appears. Also, the lack of Touka Kirishima screentime was with him was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what else to say. The show did look and sound very good, and I enjoyed it enough to sit through the whole season, but the plot and characters fell very short of the standard established in season 1.",

            "content": "Since it's initial premier in 2014, Tokyo Ghoul has taken the community by storm and added elements to the horror/ gore genre that will mark it as a show that won't be forgotten.\r\nThat being said, Tokyo Ghoul has faced a precarious balance of backlash and support as the series has continued on. The show, premiering in July of 2014 was initially directed by Shuhei Morita through the second season. The director's job was handed on to Odahiro Watanabe for Tokyo Ghoul: re which premiered April of this year and ended it's first half just before the summer season. Studio Perriot took this project on, initiallyand added Perriot+ to the equation for :re.\\n\\n\r\nInitial thoughts on the show:\\n\r\nWhat the hell is this art and animation?\\n\r\nWhat happened to the rest of the story?\\n\r\nOh, hey Kaneki, fancy meeting you here.\\n\r\nHaise, what the hell, get it together.\\n\r\nWow, what the hell is this art and animation?\\n\\n\r\nAlright, as per usual:\\n\r\nIF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT WHY I DID/ DIDN'T LIKE THE SHOW, THEN SKIP TO THE END FOR MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\n- Before I get someone jumping down my throat about this, just know that the way the story was directed makes my skin itch. I gave it a 6 because there is a semblance of effort to follow the Haise story depicted in the manga. Other than that, the story is so full of holes that needed to be filled and weren't. I don't care if you think \"they are going to do it in :re season 2,\" because the problem is that they didn't do it in season 1. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\n- WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD CHANGE THE ART AND ANIMATION STYLE LIKE THAT. You all know when twitter updated from using a square theme to a bubble theme? Or when they switched the actress for Aunt Viv in Fresh Prince of Bel Air? Yeah, that's exactly what Perriot thought was going to be a good idea. I could go on forever about this, but I'll spare you on that. All in all, what made the first two season's mistakes bearable, was how absolutely beautiful the art was. All of that was lost with the change in style. The veins and movement of the ghouls' kagunes, specifically, fell more than short of my expectations. I was incredibly disappointed that the aesthetic set by the first two seasons was lost to a bunch of bubbly art and shiny faces.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n- Sound quality wasn't bad, but I almost feel like there's a lag of the sound throughout the show, especially in battle scenes. Its like the sound and the animation are separate entities when they need to work together to help with the scene. Other than that I reaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy like the opening for this season. The singer's voice is so pure and pretty/ It was almost like the opening credits are what kept me around for the whole season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\n- Unpopular opinion: I really like Haise as a character. He may be a baby back bitch, but I think that his presence and the explanation of who he is IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STORY.\\n\r\n-cough- anyway\\n\r\nDespite liking him, Haise is just as annoying a character as the first Ken Kaneki. He has the ability to kick some ass, but he's mentally unstable and all around a brat with a death wish. The rest of the characters seem out of place with each other. There's a distinct disconnect in how the characters work together. Lastly, be prepared for the constant, miserable internal monologue happening with Urie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\n- I truly am sorry to say that my enjoyment within these 12 episodes was low and slow occurring. Despite the challenges the production team faced with the first two seasons, I thoroughly enjoyed them and was extremely let down by what was offered with :re. Despite that, I was able to watch to the end and find the good in the bad.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING: 5/10          RECOMMENDATION: Read the Manga\\n\r\n- I think the Tokyo Ghoul story is wonderful and brought a spark of originality to the table at a scale that hadn't been seen by the community in a long time (especially in the horror genre). That being said, I feel that :re did not even come close to meeting the aesthetics, story, and character depiction that the first to seasons paved the way for it to do. I think you're better off reading the manga to get a clearer understanding of the story and some semblance of consistency. That being said, I don't think the show is a bad watch, entirely, just a very disappointing one.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, everyone!\\n\r\nCome back on Friday to see which show I'll be breaking down next.\\n\\n\r\nCiao =^-^=\\n\\n\r\nAma_",

            "content": "I have no idea what is going on in this anime. I didn't read the manga. I watched the first two anime seasons and enjoyed them (gave them both a score of 8). But, re: makes no sense to me. I cannot follow the plot whatsoever. I cannot assess the characters, their relationships, their power levels and the reasoning behind such power levels, the hierarchy at CCG and how the many characters attained such positions, etc. It's UTTERLY confusing. I feel no emotional attachment with any of them. I don't even get a sense of Ken Kaneki from Haise. I understand that he has someform of amnesia, but we all know he is Kaneki. I loved Kaneki as a character, but I cannot say the same for Haise. I feel nothing for him. I don't care about his plight. I don't understand his power. I'm not particularly interested in his amnesia except that I wish he'd just quickly sort it out and turn back into Kaneki.\\n\\n\r\nHis half-ghoul squad of losers are lame and rather uninteresting. I don't understand why or how they became half-ghouls/half-human. I don't understand Aogiri Tree's intentions, strategies, or reasons for doing what they're doing. I don't understand why the show seems to be trying to make me feel some emotional connection with the Aogiri ghouls. I don't understand new weapons like \"Detached\" kagune. I don't understand how or why the ghouls are being found so easily...almost like they want to be found. I don't understand the ranking of ghouls in terms of their power nor why CCG is so effective at defeating even some of the most powerful of them like Mama and Nutcracker.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no backstory for a non-manga reader to follow. So, I just don't get it, and I'm surprised I've watched this many episodes tbh. I'll finish it because I want to see Kaneki come back to the forefront. I don't see how I could continue with this anime after this season. It's like being thrown into the last few episodes of Game of Thrones but with a far less interesting plot and zero character development for so many characters. Re: would be better off if it used flashback as a device to catch its audience up to speed. It should be extended by 12 episodes so that the story can breathe life into these characters and into its own plot.\\n\\n\r\nI like the art and sound in general. 4 is the best I could give this anime purely based on art and sound. It will be painful finishing this one most likely. When watching it I feel like I've never known the Tokyo Ghoul universe whatsoever. Very disappointing.",

            "content": "As someone who has read the manga-Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul: re-I have twice as many caveats that a person who is just watching the anime has. So I would try to make any comparison; I know that a comparison with the source material is valid, but I believe it fits better in a text apart. I will not make this critique a text \"Anime vs Manga\".\r\nBefore we got here we had two other anime: Tokyo Ghoul, which was just shallow at all, and the just too bad \"Tokyo ghoul Root A \"-that even though it has occurred in stagnation and a lazy progression ofcharacter, still had something to be said. Remember the finals of the first two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul? They were gloomy and harrowing poems about Kaneki confronting evil in and out of himself, probing the depths of his psyche. On \"Root A \" Walking purposely along the last stretch of your journey towards certain death.  The music and the visual were artistically worked to reflect the mental state of Kaneki, full of fear, despair, anger and unbearable amounts of weight on his shoulders.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Re, just like in the first two seasons, is a show that had the opportunity to be more, but eventually became more a bloodbath. Social discrimination and persecution are an issue that plagues humanity since we know it, dating back to the earliest historical texts and manuscripts. Whenever a social group feels threatened or simply does not understand the social norms of another group, hostility becomes always present. And despite our advances and technical prowess, this primitive reaction to the unknown is still a problem these days. It's just simply watching the current news and events to see that unfold on a daily basis. Because of this constant conflict, there are many stories that try to clarify the subject with social commentary in one way or another. That comes in the form of a song like what John Lennon, Bob Dylan and similar artists produce. Every narrative has approached this question one way or another. Anime are not an exception, with every year giving rise to at least one title that follows that path.\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul: Re became the title for 2018, with the story of a subspecies known as Ghouls and the tug-of-war relationship they have with humans. A configuration very similar to other anime titles like Shiki, Nikle and others. TG had the option of examining and exploring more themes such as existentialism, human condition, social Darwinism and human ethics. But the common problem that most shows, just like Tokyo Ghoul, is not being able to transmit them properly. Instead, it was simply an idea that got in the backseat so we could do another Gore action/party, not unlike other shows like Gantz, Deadman Wonderland, Terra formers etc. None of the themes are explored, not passing the level of the surface-those themes that were there simply to try to add some depth to a show that clearly lacked.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of following our protagonist Kaneki and using him as an intermediary to explore all the multifaceted themes that the show suggested, we are only teased once in a while as to his tormented mind. This is a cheap way to not properly traverse the correct steps of providing layered characterisation. So when it's present, we have a personality switch instead of a character that gets any form of development. It is simply a two-dimensional persona that moves from one side of the gradient to another. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are treated superficially. Instead of concentrating on shaping the already considerable cast, they introduce a multitude of new and less than a handful delve into the basic patterns. The rest is a territory of \"read the manga\", since they supposedly play an important role in the plot, but we never get any screen time with them to care or even remember their names. This great dependence on the source material reflects only in the roadmap below the point and the lack of proper execution. Instead, you remember them only by your extravagant presence or personality similar to caricature. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is standard, but the way they present it without any breath is deplorable. It is not even necessary to have read the base material to notice the content being drowned here; It is never conceived the chance of: re saying something. The environment of the world remains undeveloped, since we never see public concern on a large scale that must come with such a dilemma or even the themes common to this setting, such as social discrimination. The closest we've come to this is the form of law enforcement authorities, but they're considered an exaggerated sinister group, so you never feel the weight behind your actions. The only time dedicated to the construction of the world came from the first handful of episodes of season 1, and even then was not given the time due to get settled because of the erratic pace. Everything seemed just a giant piece of theater with a deep gray morality and some cockfighting. They want you to question who's right and who's wrong, but when it really happens, it seems laughable and childish.\\n\\n\r\nIf ever there was an area where \"Root a \" deserved credits, it would be in the sound department. With well-timed music tones that provided a certain ' punch ' to each scene that accompanied it and well-composed vocal tracks that brought emphasis to moments that would not normally carry any weight on their own. But, not even that  \": Re \" worried. Here we have tracks played anyway, and even an evocation to  \"Unreval\"-almost a  \"present\" to the fans for having continued to follow such a deplorable series. Or perhaps an admitted defeat; Whatever this may have proved was sad. There is a possibility that soundtracks are good in isolation, but frankly, I have no desire to look for them to listen. I may be in the minority here, given the general consensus regarding the opening, but I personally like it; As well as I liked the opening of \"Root a \".\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are summarized by the studio in charge of them-Pierrot. There are many cases where it becomes unstable and even had several whole episodes where the quality fell from beginning to end. Even for scenes where you think they would invest a little more, like the fight of Haise vs Takizawa, still contained perceptible hiccups even for untrained eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe details are the life force on which great stories are actually built, the true soul that can create or break something special. I'll have to break my promise and do a comparison of the anime and manga. I would like to bring the table a specific moment in the anime: almost halfway through the second episode, Haise confronts Uri and his role as leader. An important scene in the sleeve. and the direction of this scene is bland and mostly-without inspiration; That defines a lot of scenes here. The slap is delivered with little conviction compared to the slap on the ego that Haise delivers the URI in the sleeve. Still in the source material, this slap is then reflected in the contempt that URI begins to show defiantly facing the one who would be his superior. Ishida's art is magnificent. URI's disgust is so palpable and the reaction of his colleagues to this indiscretion is equally strong. And what does the anime deliver parallel to this? A few minutes of sheer inexpression. And yet we have the cut the scene of Haise crying in his room--a blatant of the infinite mischaracterization that the series delivers. This cry is an internal attack that Sasaki is facing by the weight of his role within the battle and within his team. All this harms these characters; There is much more to life in them than was recognized here.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Odahiro left me with nothing positive to say about this adaptation. Odahiro Watanabe does not have to follow a rule book to adapt the manga of Tokyo Ghoul, but he is not even continuing the interpretation of the series of Mikasano (screenwriter of the second season) adding something new, so little is putting thoughts in Finer details that define Ishida's work as a work of panels and dialogues. Tokyo Ghoul: Re, in the end, is nothing; Worse than that... he doesn't try to be anything. \\n",

I haven't read the manga but I get the gist why \"season 2\" was a hot garbage. And to be honest even without reading the manga there are a lot of things I can see that the studio who animated this have skipped.\r\nThe story 2: So kaneki just jumps from one group to the other? At first he denied being a half ghoul but quickly jumps into anteiku... ok fair enough because they treat him well and taught him how ghouls fitin society. Then he joined the group that tortured him to protect the people in anteiku... what?! Wouldn't it be better if he just stayed in anteiku so if things turns south he'd be there to protect them? And now he is in the ccg because....reasons, I guess? The story to me seems basic enough in a good way. Finding a place/society you will fit in despite being different, great. But the anime just want to capitalize on the action fights thus making the story a complete mess especially to those who just wants to watch the anime and not read the manga. And that's the biggest problem right there, if someone who isn't an avid manga reader but enjoys anime saw this adaptation of tokyo ghoul it failed to convince it's new audience to read the manga since the anime is a mess.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 5: at least the censored scenes were not that off putting but I can tell what they're censoring. Nice try.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3: I know unravel is masterpiece but can't they at least think of something new? As much as I hated root a at least the music was good. In here I couldn't think of a memorable song from the op, ed or even on the ost.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3: So after under developing the characters from season 1&2 you'd really expect me to care about these quinx? Whatever happened to rize? They told the audience she's this big deal for being a bindge eater but we never see her again other than from kaneki's head. The anime just keeps on shoving in new characters and sets them aside like they never exists after a couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: The action is sometimes cool and other times underwhelming. Not knowing what's going on is leaving me little to no care whatever happens to the characters. Anyone could die and I would completely forget them after an episode or two. And that's not right, the story and characters must be the strongest selling point of an anime and keeps the audience invested. Root A did not end but just stops and decided to tell a new story and expects it's new audience to read the manga before watching the anime. That's also wrong since I heard from some friends that read the manga didn't liked the anime because of skipping too much important details.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3: Season 1 was somehow good season 2&3 was just confusing and I didn't know what happened.",

The thing about this third season in the Tokyo Ghoul franchise is that it sets up a hell of a fourth season, and that alone makes it worth a watch. \r\nNaturally, the art and sound are stunning, as well as thebattles. However, the fact that Kaneki can't remember who he is makes for a very frustrating watchthrough.

            "content": "This season of Tokyo Ghoul is without a doubt the best adaptation of the entire franchise thus far. Although it will likely cover 58 chapters in this season, it is handling itself very well. The reason for this is that it's modifying its pacing so that it's slower when it needs to be and faster when it can be. Although this is by no means a perfect adaptation, it is still the best to date.\r\nStory:\r\n8/10\r\nIn terms of story, Tokyo Ghoul:re may not be nearly as thought-provoking as the original story, but it still does very well. Many people may be confused at the start ofthe series as to what the hell happened at the end of season 2. However, as time passes, that will all be revealed. They have also additionally retconned a couple of things that had been previously established within season 2 of the anime. As such, it may be a little difficult for anime only's to understand. It still does a great job nonetheless (especially in comparison to \u221aA). In the end, however, what exactly happens in the season isn't nearly as important as the direction it takes the protagonist in. What people don't understand, however, is that Kaneki doesn't have amnesia. He forced himself to forget his past and that resulted in another personality.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Tokyo Ghoul:re takes itself in a very different direction than was previously seen but I think it works pretty well. It's pretty stylish but may not be everyone's cup of tea. The animation has become a little bit sloppy but that's not really what makes the series for the better or for the worse. It's not terrible but not the best.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, in spite of how even Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA did a good job with OST. However, :re finds a way to bring out some emotional and hype-ridden OSTs that fit the mood really, really well. It's by no means My Hero Academia when it comes OSTs, but it still does a fantastic job. The OSTs played at the end of the 2nd and 3rd episodes are absolutely fantastic and fit the series very well. At the same time, the opening does wonders with the series as it fits it so damn well! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt the aspect that Tokyo Ghoul:re excels at. From the very beginning, it shows characters that you immediately care for. This season of Tokyo Ghoul:re centers around the Quinx squad, a squad of humans implanted with quinques that can basically be used as kagunes. As soon as they're introduced, they're so relatable. First, one sees Urie, who undergoes some of the most meaningful character development I have ever witnessed. Then, you have Saiko, who is a stuck up NEET that was forced to be a quinx. She is freaking hilarious and by far one of my favourite characters in the series. Another fantastic member of the quinx squad is Mutsuki, who much like Kaneki, shows such internal conflict and growth over the series. Lastly, we have Shirazu, who may be an idiot but like everyone else, grows tremendously and turns out to be one of the most loveable characters in the series. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait, what about the MC? Haise Sasaki is without a doubt one of my favourite versions of the Tokyo Ghoul protagonist. His internal struggles are so profound that it really leaves me feeling so shocked by what he displays. He doesn't want to forget his \"family\" but at the same time, he feels like he can't leave things the way they are. Over the course of the series, Sasaki continues to be haunted by his former self and his interactions and response to that is what truly makes this series great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re does a good job at hyping things up and its foreshadowing is absolutely fantastic. However, it still rushes over things at times and that in on its own makes things a little worse. Overall, it is still a very solid and enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile this is definitely the best adaptation of the entire franchise, it still suffers from some pacing and material flaws. In the end, it is still a pretty damn solid psychological Seinen.\\n",

We already know that Sasaki is kaneki, with his personality built from the previous two seasons reset completely.\r\nWith only four episodes, it is still hard to tell whether this season of the anime will reach its maximum potential of the story from the manga (or they will make different story path as they did in the first two seasons),  but until now i could say that it is promising.\r\nStudio pierrot definitely made the characters lively and enjoyable. Physical actions follow mainworld physics. I always like the kagune fights, they executed it well. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors played their character precisely, especially Urie. The opening 'asphyxia' is good in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting, typically follows those in the manga. It is nice to see how the quinx squad interacts and doing missions together.\\n\\n\r\nLet's just hope the anime will bring the same enjoyable moments like the manga, cause i love TG so much I don't want to be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nYou guys hould watch it btw.\\n",

            "content": "This season may be more controversial than root A, but it's not as bad as everyone says. Let me explain...\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re...where to start? Honestly I don't even know. I have a serious love-hate relationship with this one. I liked the overall action that was done here. All the battles were highly entertaining and very engaging. And I loved the fact that Haise was having a battle in his mind about his past and who he *really* is...but.\r\nI really hate how horrible this anime was paced. It just felt so disorienting. From the start I was asking questions like \"who's that,\" \"where's kaneki,\" \"why did helose his memories.\" Questions that a person like me (who hasn't read the manga) shouldn't be asking. They had a huge opportunity to make this a 24 episode season, combining this season with RE 2. But instead they decided to chop it right down the middle and half-ass everything, including the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are pretty entertaining...but, I still don't know who they really are or anything else other than they were assigned to kaneki as he is their \"mentor.\" I *really* wanted to find out more about the Quinx Squad, but sadly we're never really given the option. The rest of the characters from the old cast were barely shown, other than Shuu-san, who I must admit, was the only one with a decent-enough back story explanation. But other than that, many things were either glossed over, or simply not explained. Like honestly, *spoiler alert* what happens to Hinami after she gets taken by the CCG? \\n\\n\r\nSo, you're probably wondering if this anime is worth your time after that long rant. Well I have news, it kinda is. As much as this anime may have got hated on, there are some good things about it. For starters, it has a great OP! And, like I said earlier, it has some great action scenes, and has some interesting stuff going on with Kaneki. Also just to clear this up, not sure why people have said this so much, but the art style really isn't that bad. It's just not as good as the older seasons (a bit rushed, albeit still good).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give this season a shot, specially if you're already a fan on the series...HOWEVER, I would leave all expectations and just watch for fun.",

            "content": "Why should you watch Tokyo Ghoul :re?\r\nStory is Very Good (8). The question is... Did Tokyo Ghoul :re redeem the failure of its root a brother? I would say it did, but it could have been better. The reason for this statement is that, although :re did well with the story and presentation, it failed in its pacing. I have been reading the manga and it takes 3-4 chapters of the manga per episode. Please take note that each chapter of Sui Ishida's Magnum Opus is filled to the brim with details and character build up that would take time to fully adapt. So having3-4 chapters congested in a single anime episode is too much. In the case or :re, it ended up taking the story and character build up out of anime and focused more on the head on battles among doves, quinx and ghouls. Don't get me wrong, I love some good anime fights and some of the best I've seen was in this anime, but have not enough build up to back the battles up would end up in just a \"generic\" battle AMV style. This is what they should really try to work on the second season, even if it ends up as a patch to the mistakes of the previous Tokyo Ghoul anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt is Very Good (8). The difference is clear when you watch the original Tokyo Ghoul anime and it's :re counterpart. There was a huge bump in the budget this time and it shows on the details in the art per episode. It now has a refined feel to it which I really like. I would like this to be kept on the second season and polish it even further.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Very Good (8). If there is one thing that Tokyo Ghoul animation did right, it is on the sound department. Although not perfect, it captures how its universe should feel and presented through the sound. \"asphyxia\" by Co\u0308 shu Nie still continues the trend of and eerie vibe with the opening, and \"HALF\" by Ziyoou-vachi is just a perfect way to end each episode; a light, fun, yet pretentious wrapping up of the dread and darkness of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Very Good (8). One of the strongest part of the story are its characters. However, if they are not presented right they would fall into the land of forgotten characters. After watching all 12 episodes of :re, I could only count the number of characters that I remember. Most of them are remembered either because I watched the original Tokyo Ghoul, or have read the manga. This is bad, and this is the product of fast pacing of the story. Its hard to invest in characters if you do not let build up and shine as the story progresses. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Tokyo Ghoul :re is an amazing story that everyone should try. But I would still recommend that you read the manga, then watch the anime if you want to have a strong grasp of the characters and story. Or you watch the anime for the action packed Kagune and Quinque battles then go to the manga for details. Either way, you need both to fully enjoy Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I would give Tokyo Ghoul :re 8 Shirazu Kagune missiles out of 10.",

I felt that the original tokyo ghoul action scenes were epic and impactful but here I feel that its a bit lackluster. So not too impressed in what I've seen so far. The action is okay but this is Tokyo Ghoul! I expect it to be more thrilling, gory and just as violent as the previous sequels.\r\nStory 5/10: I didn't read the manga so I don't know what's going on. Everything is a bit of a mystery right now, the storyis yet to connect but its a bit messy.\\n\\n\r\nTone (Weird): The feel of Tokyo Ghoul RE is a bit weird. The new characters as much as I enjoy them, feel a bit out of place. For me Tokyo Ghoul has been a dark depressing anime of somewhat. But all of this light hearted comedy has come out. Feels like there's too much comedy and happiness in this sequel. Tokyo ghoul has always been a dark anime with pain and struggle. I don't feel that energy here.\\n\\n\r\nThese are just my personal opinions. Its still a good anime but right now I feel it's the worse than the previous 2 seasons",

If you, haven't read the manga, the first episode will be kind of all over the place until you catch on towards the end of the episode of what is actually happening ~~\r\nAlthough I think it was good, there weren't as many scenes of the characters from previous seasons andI would have really liked for there to be more scenes between Sasaki and Touka (~ ship ship ship ship ~)\\n\r\nAnother thing was that they kept on introducing new characters and proceeding to kill them off, which I found a bit meaningless. I don't think, from the viewer's point of view there was enough time for people to actually develop a deep impression of said characters. \\n\r\nSo....To watch or not to watch? That is the question I suppose!\\n\r\nAlthough I am a little disappointed, I would still recommend giving it a watch, since the story line progresses quite a bit and as I mentioned, there are a few new characters and more scenes or those that weren't really in the previous seasons *cough* Arima *cough* in them. \\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nHope you guys found this review helpful! \u0295\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re is the sequel to the original Tokyo Ghoul manga and the anime fails on many fronts to capture what makes the manga great. \r\nStory- 3\r\nThe story introduces us to Quinx Squad, a group of half human/ half ghouls who work for the CCG to hunt down criminal ghouls. \r\nHaving a squad of characters as the typical \"main focus\" is a nice change from the original series that had Kaneki as our MC. The problem here is that the squad never really gets any time for themselves to feel fleshed out. The source material here is rushed as it is made by none otherthan Studio Pierrot. There are too many plotlines at the start of :Re and it sure can make those watching it confused.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the info dump that the original source had, the anime sacrifices this in hopes that us the viewers can understand all that happens but it's just not enough. There are many new characters that are introduced and killed off easily, serving no purpose whatsoever. It's because of this that makes the show very hard to recommend, the multiple plot lines hurt it and does the show no favors since much content gets axed.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation- 3\\n\r\nStudio Pierrot rarely ever has any sort of show that can be said it has \"good animation.\" Where the first two seasons of TG look ok at best, the production values of :Re are much much lower. From the first episode onward character models are very inconsistent. Much of the anime involves stills and the fights are as bland and cheap with no sort effort to be put in. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 3\\n\r\nIt's ok. OST of the show is nothing great, it does it job at complimenting certain scenes as it needs to. The OP \"Asphyxia\" by Co\u0308 shu Nie is pretty damn nice while ED \"HALF\" by Ziyoou-vachi is a decent but awkward closer given the content of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 3\\n\r\nReally the only likable new character for me was Saiko. She's just one of those \"one dimensional\" waifu bait characters. She's cute, lazy, likes to eat and play games. Everyone else besides her, Haise and Shuu are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nAs horrid of an adaptation this may be i cant deny I liked it. It's hard for me to bash it since i love the original source so much but really the anime couldn't fully kill it. My enjoyment would be a 1000 times higher if it was a actual decent or even good adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 3\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment aside, this adaptation is a waste of time. Please do yourself a favor and read the manga. If you are looking for a good story and wonderful character development then you won't find it here as it doesn't exist. The second cour is slated in October and I highly doubt it'll be any better than this under Pierrot's supervision. \\n",

            "content": "WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THE REVIEW!  \r\nI will try my best to avoid any spoilers, but they are unavoidable at some parts. If you dont want to be spoiled with anything, please GO WATCH THE SHOW FIRST!\r\nThis review is solely based on the anime, i didnt read the manga, and im not planning to do anytime soon. So.. where do i start? Oh boy, it's hard indeed. Why? Because this show is just a big mess. First episode throws an audience into an ocean of confusion, not even trying to explain a single bit of what's actually happening, and why it's happening. I diddeduce everything pretty quickly, but i didnt like how it was done at all, just completely unnecesary. And with this magnificent start, we're moving to the actual plot.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nA few words: ALL. OVER. THE. PLACE. I was really confused what is the actual main plot there. It was bouncing from one to another all the time, without any real conclusion. Don't get me wrong, i like complex plots in my shows, but this one was made so badly i couldn't get hooked in any of it. Too many meaningless characters thrown just to fill the plot hole and make as much story compressed in 12 episodes as possible. Once again, i didnt read the manga, but i have a feeling, that the show should have twice as many episodes to make any sense at all, and hook you up in the story. The transitions in-between were not smooth, not even one bit. This makes you bored just after a few episodes, and there's nothing that can stop it. \\n\\n\r\nART: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nA seriously big downgrade in the animation. Especially noticeable within the fighting scenes. I dont know why is that, considering it's the 3rd season already, just.. why? It feels clunky, not smooth and sometimes just ugly. Alot of some smaller studios can do a better work with not so big amount of money. I dont know who's to blame, but nevertheless, it's super average.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul series always had some very good openings in my opinion. This one is still very solid, and i really enjoyed it (nothing beats the 1st season opening though, it was godlike). The ending is very forgettable, besides the first few seconds, where the riff starts. Its okay, but the rest, always skip. The same goes for the whole music in this show. Its super forgettable. I tried to pay attention for a few episodes, but it just didnt matter, i stopped and didnt even care about it later. Just some average stuff thrown in to play in the background, like it was done without any effort whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is an abomination of a character design. This is the reason why this show is such a letdown for me. And im gonna be clear, i'll be VERY ANGRY on this part. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Kaneki K... i mean, HAISE SASAKI. Dear god. We're back to the most average character design in the history of anime. Boring, naive, and of course always super nice and altruistic for NO FUCKING REASON. You thought that he was the worst in the 1st season? NOPE. This is way worse. It's like he's just a walking mannequin without any personality at all. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the secondary characters dont matter at all, besides just a few in my opinion, and they're not even in the team with a main character. And im gonna be honest, i need to look at their names to describe them, because i just forgot most of them an hour after watching the show. That should say how forgettable everyone in this show is. \\n\\n\r\nHaise's team was also just the most average group of people you could imagine in an anime show, and the only kinda likable person was Ginshi. Kuki was the stereotypical type of a douchebag with power-hungry complex, and Tooru just a weaker link in the team, there always must be one, right? Right. Wait, there's one more.. yeah. Saiko. Just tell me please. Who is she? Why is she there? You wont know ANYTHING. She is just there for the 'comedic' purposes, being annoying and trying to be cute, and failing miserably in it, just to relieve some stress between some situations i suppose? There is nothing said about her IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING SHOW! She  just walks around, and complains, doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I SHIT YOU NOT. Ill never get why does she exist there.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with portraying anyone here is that there's VERY little story said about anyone. The most hilarious ways they do it here is when you're in the last episodes, and there is some memory retrospect section for about 30 seconds in the middle of a fight for a character that you dont care for, because they didnt say a single word about his life, feelings, desires, family. Just absolutely nothing. How am i supposed to feel any sympathy to anyone at this point? This is just a GIANT trainwreck of a character design. The only enjoyable characters were some of the Rose family, because there was some kind of a plot, and passion between the family and the servants. Not the best one, but it was pretty okay. And that's it. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI have a feeling that this season had way more fights thrown in than the other ones. Im not a big fighting scene freak myself, i prefer the story-driven, character building anime shows, but i get that people enjoy some good action. Good action in this one isnt a good word to describe anything though. The clunky animation and the poorly made story was the nail to the coffin, and left this show without almost nothing to offer to me. I was bored and annoyed for the 3/4 of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nI really wish this show was made well, but its just empty, lifeless and confusing. The combination of horrible character writing and the story that feels always unfinnished makes all of this a disaster. It is possible that it's made in a rush to squeeze in the manga in just 12 episodes for some reason, but i cant really tell. I would recommend this only to a die-hard Tokyo Ghoul fans, otherwise, dont waste your time. It's not worth it.\\n\\n",

Subsequently, my excitement with the adaptation announcement was expected, but, when the time came, the anime gave me a single impression: pathetic.\r\nThe disappointment began when the PV's were released, and here is where I start.\r\nART: 1\r\nMy eyes are still hurting from this stupid animation, it is exacly like those fan animations and I'm not even joking (I don't mean to offend anyone who does fan animations, it is only that I expected more than a beginner's work from a big studio).\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nOnce again, the problem with a Tokyo Ghoul adaptation is the small amount of episodes for a large number of chapters, but this time the solution was quite different and really worse. Instead of cutting some parts, they decided to put everything, however, they reduced the amount of time per scene, leaving an impression of lack of development and resulting in odd rushed passages. Honestly, I couldn't take anything seriously, because it all seemed so ridiculous. Even the parts in the manga that were precious to me and made me so emotional were completely laughable. Another thing is, if you hadn't read the manga, it's impossible to understand it. They put too much information in a short time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\r\nI liked both opening and ending. At least this they made it right. Even so, the rest of the soundtrack was kind of \"meh\" and that one moment that Unravel started to play was very cringey. After all, I think the time was inappropriate and the song was put only to create emotion over a poorly executed scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 3\\n\r\nI really like the Tokyo Ghoul:re characters, but, just like I said on the story part, you can't absorve it with such a rushed timeline. There's no real development whatsoever and the ones who only watched the anime can't remember anyone.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 2\\n\r\nIn a short explanation, it only made me angry and cringe a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 2\\n\r\nWhen all these thing I talked about come together, it results in a big mess and I seriously can't see how anyone enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Man, I haven't written one of these in a while but allow me to just get back into the swing of things in order to vent my frustration on this absolutely disgusting insult of an anime. Remember: This is only regarding the anime. The manga has nothing to do with this and I trust that it had a good follow-up to boot.\r\nSo, why am I frustrated? Well, simples. It's because this anime is literally UNWATCHABLE if you have not read the manga. There are just so many plot points that have been skipped over since the last available prequel, Tokyo Ghoul Season 1. (Yes, RootA doesn't count because it was it's own thing), that you would give up trying to care about what's going on after a certain point. Like seriously, new characters get introduced and hurt and killed so on so forth, and I'm just sitting there going: \"Well, that happened. Who was that again?\" Not to mention, if we' just talk about the many ghouls in this show, the anime is trying to tell me to care about their plight and symphatise with them. But just like some bad guys in Attack on Titan S2, I couldn't give a hoot about these \"characters: let alone two. But to AOT S2's credit, it only lasted about 3 to 5 episodes. This was a whole 12 episode season. \\n\\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on Shu!!! Just Shu Shu Go Away I Swear. You expect me to somehow feel for this character... who tried to kill Kaneki and the gang in S1... and somehow forgive him for some reason without any prior evidence as to why I should?! GTFOOH!!! It was laughable to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even if you don't understand what's going on, is it worth watching just to see the visual spectacles? Haha. In your dreams. You seriously believe that visuals by Studio Pierrot are that transcendent? This show is average at best when it comes to animation, as usual by a crappy animation studio. \\n\\n\r\nAs an anime-only, this was just disgusting. And to all you mofos out there who counteract with: \"Read the manga, man!\", I have this argument to make:\\n\\n\r\nIF I HAVE TO READ THE MANGA JUST SO I CAN WATCH YOUR GODDAMN ANIME, THEN THIS ANIME MIGHT AS WELL NOT EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S NOT SPECTACULARLY ANIMATED IN THE FIRST PLACE.\\n\\n\r\nIt is safe to say that I have pretty much had it with Studio Pierrot and all their mediocrities. If this is how they are gonna treat their audience, then I might as well just stop putting trust on them. This show was a huge waste of time. SCREW YOU, STUDIO PIERROT. I AM DONE!!!",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re is what I expected but definitely not what I wanted.\r\nA poorly adapted anime.\r\nAfter Studio Pierrot decided to take the story into their own hands with the previous season Root A, fans were already disappointed. Tokyo Ghoul:re just adds to that disappointment.\r\nStory : 5/10\r\nTG:re occurs after a time skip of two years after the events of the raid on Anteiku. It features the investigator's side of the story, hoping to stress on the fact that there are losses on both sides of the war between the Ghouls and Humans. Unfortunately, the anime just doesn't add enough depth or assertion to the story. With alot of the backstories feeling repetitive, TG:re just reuses stuff from the original season, which was already sub-par when compared with the original work of Ishida Sui.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is despicable. I was hopeful when I watched the first episode, but it all went downhill from there. The studio hasn't yet realised that Tokyo Ghoul is not a generic shounen and should not be treated so. The fight scenes have no lustre to the point that all the action seems childish. There's generic shounen tropes like landing multiple hits at once, or that the seemingly harmless character is actually extremely powerful. Also, this is a series which should not be driven by action because the depth gets lost due to a change of focus.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, \"asphyxia\" by Co\u0308 shu Nie is amazing, almost as perfect a fit as \"unravel\" was for the first season. Chaotic music, all jumbled up, kind of highlights the messed up mental state of the protagonist. The ending, \"HALF\" by Ziyoou-vachi is also great which is a bit of a break from the general theme of the series showing some light-hearted moments of the members of the Chateau.\\n\r\nApart from this, the anime offers nothing else. The music is not a focus during action, which just leads to awkward music-less fighting, and takes away any remaining feelings of enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe producers reused \"unravel\" again, which could have had a great nostalgia effect if it was not almost completely muted when it played.\\n\r\nMoments where the OST reflects the setting of the episode are rare.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't give equal priorities to characters, with some just showing up when they're useful and then exiting for the rest of the episode.\\n\r\nThe main characters aren't very well developed and even though it's been only six episodes, my hopes aren't high.\\n\r\nSasaki Haise : Sasaki is the leader of the members of the chateau, who takes care of them and trains them in fighting. He himself was mentored by Arima Kishou and Mado Akira. The anime doesn't show any of his own ideology, or how he thinks. Rather, his main goal is projected to be to protect his mental state by keeping Kaneki suppressed. Character development is non existent.\\n\r\nUrie Kuki : Urie is perhaps the only character who really got some development. He is portrayed as a person with a superiority complex who deceives others just to get his way. He has potential, but let's his judgement get clouded by his envy for others.\\n\r\nShirazu Ginshi : It feels like some details were just skipped upon and Shirazu hasn't just been developed as a character. So far he is just the side kick.\\n\r\nMutsuki Tooru : I must say, Tooru is an extremely interesting and complex character in the manga. The anime doesn't give the same vibe.\\n\r\nYonebayashi Saiko : So far her screentime has been limited, so no comments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 1/10\\n\r\nMid-way between watching TG:re, I realised why I was so critical of everything. The main reason is that it's boring. The only agenda of the production seems to be merchandising by creating cool characters. In other words, making money. And it's garnering success because it's previous seasons were very successful anime. It does seem that everything is being rushed, with the production committee barely meeting deadlines which results in poor animation. I also don't have a lot of hopes for Tokyo Ghoul:re Season 2, which airs in October 2018. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, with skipped details and a lot less focus on the story than is required, it is barely a shadow of what the anime could have been.",

For those of you continuing from TG: Root, you will find yourself scratching your head as to how in the world you possibly got here.\r\nStory (1/2): A time skip and confusing circumstances. Very little gets cleared up as the season goes on. More questions are raised than answers given.\r\nThere is an overall story arc but it really does not fit the TG world we got to know in the first two seasons. I don't like to compare animeto Manga or LN content but it almost seems like the producers just picked a random handful of scenes from the Manga and didn't consider continuity of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe action really picks up in the last few episodes but gives no answers to the story or the characters motives. Everything seems arbitrary.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1/2): You only see a few old characters and the new ones are very bland. Very little information is given making their story seem dull and boring. The only interesting characters do not stick around long. It does bring back a few characters from the OVA's, so thats cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC has an interesting inner struggle that we see him constantly battle with. It is done really well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (1.5/2): Quality animation, but fewer fight scenes. It did not look on par with the previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Voice (1.5/2): Great voice acting and suitably disturbing music that matches the series. The OP and ED were good.\\n\\n\r\nBonus/Other Points (0/2, nothing noticeable stands out): \\n\r\nThere is a surprising amount of LGBT/cross dressing/effeminate men content in this season.\\n\r\nWhile not being great, there are good moments, but a LOT of bad and dull moments.\\n\r\nThis series is coasting on a solid first season and huge potential from the manga.\\n\r\nSeriously whats going on?",

            "content": "Watch this only if you like watching dumpster fires, otherwise drop it if you can.\r\nMinor spoilers and complaining below, etc. etc.\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nI was only watching this for OP Kaneki, which brings me to my first point:\r\nThe thing with the Tokyo Ghoul anime (to me) is that its true strengths lie in narrative situations where the show is undeniably shounen: the finale of season 1 works and gets people excited and riled up because it's the common shounen trope of the OP character rising from the ashes to take on a Big Bad Villain and defeat the crap out of him. It's an anime classic. The OP-ness,the fight choreography, the Unravel that played in the background to heighten the intensity of the scene, all worked together to create a rather \"shounen\" effect. And this can be tied back to the previous episodes in the season as well, where the fights and ghoul encounters followed a similar execution style. Tokyo Ghoul as an anime is unable to devote the level of time and detail to craft a story that will make you \"feel things\" based on themes and concepts alone; instead it relies on stereotypical action and suspense to capture people's attention, with the darker themes simply there as an added plus. And that's totally acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nBut :re doesn't even have that much.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it was sort of gone already in season 2. I have this theory that there's a direct relationship between Tokyo Ghoul the anime's anticlimactic-ness and how sociopathic/angsty Kaneki is that season--which is ironic, because I don't think that was what the anime (or manga) originally intended. Hence, why it fails. There's a lot left unexplained throughout season 1, but it was never ambiguous or confusing to the point that it was bothersome. :re takes this ambiguity to an entirely different level, to the point where it feels like...the studio wasn't even trying anymore. With the Kaneki v. Jason fight, you can tell that they wanted it to be epic; they wanted viewers to get really into it, to freak over Kaneki's power-up, to worship his bad***ery. You can tell, even in season 2, when they lingered on Yoshimura's backstory, that they wanted to speak to something about human-ghoul relationships and the hardships he had to endure. \\n\\n\r\nInstead in :re, none of the action scenes made any logical sense. On top of that, we're introduced to, pretty much, an entirely new set of characters. Kaneki himself is totally new, hardly recognizable in appearance and personality, followed by a cast of negligible borderline-ghoul-doves or whatever. There's a lot of implied tragic backstory going on at first, an indication of a lot of trauma that the characters have experienced in the past--but, like, you can only foreshadow this for so long before I stop caring. Rather than exploring these past events in detail to develop our *central* characters--the ones with most screen time, mind you--the show inexplicably decides to spend multiple episodes uncovering the backstory and pre-re: events of a servant (?) of Tsukiyama Shuu, who was also easily one of the minor \"main\" characters in the previous two seasons. At the same time, it pummels us with *scraps* of details on Aogiri, other random character experiences pre-time skip, names of characters and places and events that we're apparently supposed to know and remember?, and a little too much focus on random CCG members who maybe had, like, a one-minute scene in prior seasons.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I was left wondering if the studio was even trying to get us to care at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the biggest disappointment about this season. There are occasional glimpses of themes and messages that the story is trying to communicate, but none of it could be concretely pieced together in any way thanks to how the show is executed. The fights played out almost in slow-motion, and I found myself simply waiting for a minor character to die rather than leaning in and becoming emotionally invested in the action that unfolded. 95 percent of the time, it was because I just didn't know what was going on. It's sloppily done, and done in a way with little to no heart put into it. It's like this season was planned, and the writers/producers started working on it, and at the end of each episode they would throw their pencils down and lean back and look at each other and say, \"Well, we tried.\" And shrug. And go home. It always seemed like my attention was constantly being pushed to focus on a multitude of possible plot points at once without any real reward in the end. This was why I said :re is incredibly anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nSo Tokyo Ghoul:re is missing a lot of things: interesting characters, direction that actually makes sense, good pacing, and OP Kaneki. It felt like a shell of its former self, an anime that had no heart and care put into it, a season that, to sum it all up, was very emotionally detached from its viewers and fans. It didn't seem to care, and so now, neither do I.\\n\\n\r\n(Jk I'm still hanging onto the hope that OP Kaneki will make a reappearance which is why I'm watching the final season lol)\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 4/10 for holding my attention long enough to finish all 12 episodes, some effort on the art/sound/animation, some effort to bring back the old days by playing Unravel in that one episode where Kaneki almost was OP and then wasn't, and Urie not being a total a** in the final episode.",

But it does not give any excuse for bad animation, where the action scenes were hardly moving. They were practically just pictures.\r\nAlso as for character, I could not get attached to this character name Haise sasaki. When I watched season 1 and 2, I liked Kaneki for who he wassince he was likable and had some kind of emotions. But Haise Sasaki is a bad character since he seems like he has no emotion what so ever. Even when he does it seems fake.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did not enjoy this anime as much as I did for season 1 and 2. It would have been way better if the animation quality was higher and if there was more character development.",

I have never read the manga, so can't base this review off of how great other people say it is. This review may contain spoilers:\r\nPlot- 1/5\r\nHaise is an amnesiac Kaneki. Now knowing all the trauma he went through during the first 2 seasons, you would expect more psychological trauma when he starts to regain his memories, but nope. He honestly sounds kinda whiny about not wanting to go back to being Kaneki even though he doesn't remember much abouthimself just that he use to be a ghoul named Kaneki. Other than that there's no plot I could ascertain. Maybe this would have been better as a movie.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/5\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters, new or old are enjoyable. The old ones don't make many appearances and the new ones aren't interesting at all. One thing I hated about  this season, is that  they made the old characters bad. Like all characters that you wanted to know more about were lackluster and probably didn't need to be in this season. The only one I liked towards the end died, so...\\n\\n\r\nSound:0/5\\n\\n\r\nThe most disappointing thing in :re for me is the sound. I loved the previous ops and ends, but like the rest of the anime the sound is just bad. The most enjoyable part is when they played season one's opening during an episode. The music in the episodes at times to me sounded like a bad remix of the previous seasons sounds.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/5\\n\\n\r\nAverage at best. Which may not seem bad, but other seasons were just beautiful to watch. There were scenes you would never forget. I just finish watching this and can't recall anything special during the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/5\\n\\n\r\nOne because only the last episode was even close to enjoyable. If you're very read the manga probably skip 1-10 and just watch the last 2.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nJust a huuugge disappointing overall. I binged the episodes, because if I had taken my time, I don't believe I would have completed it. I really liked the story they put forth during the first seasons that's why I finished it, so I'm really hoping next season is better. I scored it an emotional  5 because I know how good it could have been.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re Anime Review\r\nEpisodes: 12\r\nGenres: Horror, Supernatural, Psychological\r\nPlot: 3.5/10\r\nMost stories will have a clear problem in the beginning that the characters need to resolve before the book or show ends. Like in a classic mystery: someone dies, we need to figure out who killed them. Tokyo Ghoul:re doesn\u2019t have something like that? We\u2019re introduced to a mishmash of character who seem to not have any motivations, except one. Nothing happens that would indicate a problem until the anime is 3/4 over. The characters just live their lives, doing whatever they want, not achieving anything. The story is actually about how Haise deals with his lostmemories, but the way he deals with it is so incredibly unrealistic and boring. The show cannot even get its main objective done well. Also, can we talk about Deus Ex Machina? Maybe used once or twice in a show isn\u2019t that bad, but multiple times in every episode? It\u2019s so annoying when none of the characters can die because everyone apparently has magical powers of living. You finally think someone will die, nope saved by some random luck. It\u2019s poor story writing when you rely on this clich\u00e9 so heavily.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation is \u201cmeh\u201d at best. There\u2019s nothing really special about it. For a show heavily focused on fight scenes, said fight scenes weren\u2019t animated to their full potential. Why this category gets a 6 however, is the art. I quite liked the character designs and seeing how old characters changed. Juuzou <3\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nNumerous times while watching this show I thought to myself, \u201cYou know, there may be something wrong with your show if the opening theme is the greatest thing about it\u201d. The opening was great; everything else was lackluster. Nothing more to be said about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1.5/10\\n\r\nThis is my biggest problem with the show by far. None of the characters were likable, none (Juuzou is cool tho). The show tries it hardest to make you like the characters, except Urie, and feel for their struggles, but you just feel nothing. The show makes the ghouls out to be these harmless creatures that just need to eat, but you really couldn\u2019t care less if any of them died. Speaking of Urie, he was the most annoying character I have ever had the misfortune of seeing in my entire life. His monologue was simply there to prove how much of a jerk he is and everything he does, everything is useless to the plot. He does nothing, but make himself look idiotic. Now, do the characters have any development? No. No they don\u2019t. The one character that is meant to have a lot of development, Haise, is the most indecisive person I have ever seen. I don\u2019t want to talk about the ending because of spoilers, but you cannot have a character develop when they are constantly fluttering back and forth on how to behave. His entire character is a mess.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 4/10",

Nevertheless, my expectations were high because I was hyped for it 3 years ago. You can figure that I've read the manga too.\r\nHere's my biggest issue with the anime.\r\nIt's confusing. I've spoken to a lot of people who are anime only be very confused about what is going on. \"I thought Tsukiyama and Kaneki weren't that close?\" \"Who are these people?\" And so on. Since I know the story form the back of my hand Ican easily follow along, but the story isn't some easily explainable and thoroughly linear work. I firmly believe you need to experience the manga in order to get full enjoyment from Tokyo Ghoul. With the specific style, foreshadowing, and narrative missing from the animation, the story is bland and frankly not as interesting. The panels were drawn in a specific way that makes their following animated direction seem awkward or lacking. However, no one I know will read the manga because they thought the anime was subpar. I agree. Unless I were that curious to see what would happen next I wouldn't be bothered to. I wouldn't be able to believe the manga is much better than the anime adaptations. Japan knew this would be an issue. They tried to send out ad campaigns telling watchers to read the original Tokyo Ghoul manga to understand the events a little more. This should not have been an issue in the first place, and it definitely contributed to why so many people are scoring this with such mediocre scores.The anime left out so many specific details, lines, and panels that I can't even begin to list them. \\n\\n\r\nI had to set all of my disagreements with the anime aside so I could still enjoy it. It's a good way to spend almost a half an hour of your time. Brutal honesty. I got to see some of my favorite characters and scenes animated at least. Not as impactful as I originally read them, but I was satisfied with seeing them at least.\\n\\n\r\nI loved, loved the musical scores. I can listen to Asphyxia for hours on end. I really loved the ending too. The OST was pretty enjoyable as well. It was reminiscent to Root A, but the music was one of the good things about Root A in my eyes. It was refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice to look at. I thought the animation was stellar at most points, but it definitely had its choppy moments.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Tokyo Ghoul:re an 7 because I love the original story and the art and music were great. The anime was cut short for 12 episodes and that can't be helped. The anime's story was lacking, which is why it got knocked down three numbers.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish people would give the :re manga a chance. It really makes Mondays survivable. I know it's by far not for everyone, though.",

Most of the episodes of this installment are just one big battle played out over several episodes. But the battle makes no sense. :RE jumps around all over the place. Seemingly random stuff happens, and there's very little continuity of the story. It feels like you're in some random dream when random people just start doing random things, and nothing is explained why they are doing it, or who this or that new person is,and why are the acting that way? Why is this person upset? Why are they doing this?\\n\\n\r\nThat's what this show feels like. Like one long random series of random events.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happened to Kaneki Ken? Why is he now some guy named Haise, fighting ghouls? Why can't he remember who he is? None of this makes any sense. \\n\\n\r\nSupposedly much more of this series makes sense if you read the manga, but for anime watchers, there's really no continuity of the story. If you left off on Season 2 of Ghoul and came into this, the effect is as if a huge chunk of the story has gone missing and you feel as though you've missed a lot of very important things, without them being explained from the time of the last anime, to this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels like this series has taken an interesting manga, and so badly executed it that it's worked out as a terrible mishmash of random events with huge holes in sections of the story and so much random chaos that you have no idea what's happening or why things are going the way they are or people doing things they're doing, that the overall feel is just one of confusion. \\n\\n\r\nThere's lots of potential here, but overall, :Re fails.",

In case you do not know, this adaptation is going through, pretending the events of Tokyo Ghoul's second season did NOT happen.\r\nTL;DR at the bottom (wtf, this isn't even long)\r\n*If you have absolute NO intention in reading the source material or give a single shit about understanding the events going on in THIS season, ignore anything in brackets ()\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul:re is well, insert description here, taking place 3 years later after the events of the manga Tokyo Ghoul. We are introduced with our main character, HaiseSasaki, a ghoul investigator part of the CCG as the mentor of the Quinx squad. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the story, because the first half of the season are rushed into 12 episodes, the pacing is ridiculously fast, thus, the characterization, and minor details can't all be included. Not surprisingly enough, even the major details are skipped on, which I won't spoil as you will eventually find out if they are stitched in later on, probably not, (it's Studio Pierrot). Characters from the Quinx squad have backstories that are briefly touched upon and are handled poorly. I'll give credit where its due especially because it's a 12-EPISODE season that efforts are being made towards character development, such as Urie's backstory on his father, gives a good explanation for where his loosely-bonding personality comes from, his desire for credit, credit, and credit.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to the first two seasons, the Tokyo Ghoul:re anime's adaptation of the story is a big step up from its predecessor season, Tokyo Ghoul Root A, and a lot similar to the first season, (so far it is fairly faithful to the manga and brought this up a million times, the pacing is inevitable for a 12-episode season)\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound:\\n\\n\r\nFOR a 12 episode season I THINK it's expected the animation should be PRETTY good. right? \\n\\n\r\nStarting this season off, you would think that they were at least saving the animation for the later episodes but as we get to the halfway mark, there is no sign of it. The shit animation isn't very noticeable but it's evident that they are incomplete. the art is pretty good, but how far are still frames going to get you? \\n\\n\r\n( art is probably the least of the problems Studio Pierrot faces when they fuck up their adaptations. had to add in my bias towards Studio Pierrot somewhere.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall / Enjoyment / TL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nIF you are an anime-only and are deciding on watching this...\\n\\n\r\n(Read the manga, read the manga, and read the manga)  Do some research before starting the season as it doesn't follow the events of the season aired before it.\\n\\n\r\nIF you are a manga reader and are deciding on watching this...\\n\\n\r\n(Read the mang- why are you planning on watching this season? oh right because we don't have any other anime studio that won't censor the hell out of it. yeah fuck you wit studio)\\n\\n\r\nIF you are COMPLETELY new to this series and are deciding on watching this...\\n\\n\r\nit's clear you are interested in this series, (read the manga) you clever bastard, (spare some of your intellect for the dumb asses who chose to not to read the manga) before watching this season and if you are confused out of your ass, watch the first season, and do some research and/or read the original from start to finish or from roughly chapter 70..",

Studio Pierrot has done a fine job at ruining what could have been a masterpiece in the cross-genre of action/horror. \r\nAfter leaving fans hanging for over 3 years with nothing but a disappointing sequel of \u221aA to reminisce about, TG made a comeback with even worse arts and more clich\u00e9 plotlines. Gone are the electric and vibrant palette which is now a somber and vapid backdrop. The MCs have become less psychological withSasaki looking like a bishounen in the role of a hero and always jumping out at the right moment to save the day. Stagnant interactions between characters and unsatisfactory horror scenes seem to wrap the show up nicely. \\n\\n\r\nSince Unravel, have we seen another \"cool and catchy\" song coming from TG? Fortunately, now we have. The opening song is sweet yet chilling at the same time and is extremely befitting TG. But it's not iconic. And don't get me started on that mistake of an ending song. I mean what on earth am I listening to Pierrot?\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for the sequel to your fav anime, try the manga. \\n\\n\\n",

Re is not what you would expect it to be, it's set 2 years in the future and doesn't necessarily have much correlation to 1 and 2. \r\nThe story follows the synopsis seen here with Haise Sasaki being the focal point of the 2 part season.They basically took all the good parts of Tokyo Ghoul and shoved it down adrain. I haven't finished the manga but I can say so far that it is better than the anime. Not shaming Studio Pierrot but I would be so down for a Tokyo Ghoul: Brotherhood made by a different studio. If only it followed the manga...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I'm not going to complain too much. In contrary to others I thought that 1 & 2 were great (1 being the superior). Re also had some good parts like the sound track and art. The characters were a bit too overwhelming since so many were introduced in a short time span (once again read the manga, the transition is better).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Tokyo Ghoul:Re a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul:re is the first half of Season 3 in the three-part Tokyo Ghoul series.\r\nThis half of the season is, without doubt, a disappointment in many aspects.  From the first scene, the show jumps into action without bothering to provide background information about any of the new characters.  The episodes did not follow a strategic storyline and instead spread out in multiple, often nonsensical, directions.  While retaining a value of uniqueness, the plot was overly complex and decidedly underwhelming.  Thankfully, every episode had something of consequence; there were no noticeable fillers.\r\nThe art is a significant 'upgrade' from the kind found inTokyo Ghoul (S1) and Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA (S2). \\n\r\n However, this is nothing special as many anime underwent a graphics upgrade in recent years.  While the art style fit the show, it's a far cry from the art found in the original series.  It also made it disconcerting having to reconcile with new looks for old characters.  That being said, the character designs were fresh and introduced new themes into the show.  All scenes, action and otherwise, were well-made and fluid.  The designing and production crews did not grant room for errors.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English SUB of this show and I'm pleased to report the sound quality is solid.  Every voice actor felt natural in their respective character roles.  The background music found across a variety of scenes was well-made.  The intro and outro music had an intriguing tone that I found enjoyable to listen to; I almost never skipped either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was monumental in this part of S3 - although not in the traditional way.  One of my prominent complaints of the first season of Tokyo Ghoul was the lack of personality development which led to stale characters.  In this half of S3, I can attest to the presence of significant change in many characters in the show.  While this may sound positive initially, there is a downside.  Almost none of the character development is viewable - it all happened before the show began.  The worst part is the viewer isn't told why some characters are behaving significantly differently than in S1.  Some aggressive characters were toned down and vice versa.  However, both the antagonists and protagonists had clear-cut goals and plans to achieve them.  The majority of the characters are unique and not easy to forget.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Tokyo Ghoul:re has some factors in its favor - overall the show is a lackluster husk of what it should have been.  It did not capitalize on the storyline nor did it attempt to offer insight into the happenings behind the scenes.  As the audience, we're expected to just 'know things.'\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't a huge fan of this half of S3.  It's not a terrible season half; nor is it a good one.  It's simply 'alright.'  After watching the original Tokyo Ghoul, I set a certain list of standards - most of which weren't met.  I'm hoping the latter half of S3 is better.",

A manga that had the potential of being a true masterpiece has been adapted where potions of the story are cut out and important reveals are not even given much thought. Just thinking about the fact that they are releasing the sequel in October which is a 12 episode season and is the final season is truely disappointing and sad. 120 chapters in 12 episodes is madness, especially when it is a manga where detail matters most and so does almost every chapter. Either they will skip anarc or they will squeeze 10+ chapters into each episode. Both ways, i cannot find the \"bright\" side for this adaptation. Perriot and Perriot Plus have really let the community down with this. No hate to them as I understand that anime is an industry and is a business for them but budget limitation and stuff should not be the primary issue. We are talking about the same studio that made Naruto, Naruto Shippuden, Bleach, Yuu Yuu Hakusho and is currently making shows such as Black Clover and Boruto. You guys invested fortunes into making fillers on fillers and invested in making so manu of these 50+ episode shows that putting that same care and consideration for Tokyo Ghoul would not have hurt. I understand that it is a considerably different show from the other ones they have made and is quite dark however it is already so well known in the world with poor adaptation, Imagine if they did an amazing or atleast a good adaptation they would have made this one of the biggest animes of its time. All that is left is the last season this October and they have already spoiled major reveals from the anime. Only good thing that has come out of Re season 2 is the opening since TK (who made \"Unravel\") is back and has made the opening for season 2. Hopes are low but still i hope they do show a miracle. Heart is broken that one of my favourite shows is ending like this but oh well, you cannot have all the happiness in the world.  Time to watch, cry, and move on...",

            "content": "(Spoilers) \r\nI'm writing this as somone whose only watched the anime so bare that in mind cuz I think it's important for what I'm saying. \r\nSo the biggest disappointment about this series is the story and how, as an anime only person, the story makes no fucking sense. The 2nd season(Root A) was a completely original series because they wanted to capitalise on the popularity of the original Manga but the Manga was not yet finished so the animation team made up there own story to fill the gap which is why the popular opinion is that it sucked. Skip forward to Tokyo Ghoul:Re andthey are back to the original Manga however a HUGE chunk of the story is now missing between the first season, the made up second season and now the third season. So your constantly left with the feeling of what the fuck is going on? Who are these people? Where have the original cast gone? They don't even try to explain this absence of continuity. Not even a summary. And people going 'read the Manga and you'll understand' is not an excuse.\\n\r\nWhat personally annoyed me the most was how the 'old cast' act around kaneki(Haise). So kaneki has forgotten who he was, Touka etc do turn up a couple times but they seem to have no will to remind kaneki of anything. For those who don't know, what actually happened in the Manga is that Arima won against kaneki and forcefully gave him amnesia. Something all his old buddies knew. So why on earth are none of them trying to get him back!? Why are they fine leaving him in the care of their enemies who are hunting them down?  Touka and kaneki were pretty much in love but does she want to help him get his old self back? Nah. Tsukiyama came pretty close to helping him but when Halse actually straight-up asks Tsukiyama to tell him what he used to be like, he bottles it and doesn't say anything. In sure thats to force a bit of drama or something but it's just unrealistic. \\n\r\nIm conclusion I guess I still enjoyed it, but the lapse in story(you HAVE to read the Manga to fully understand what's happening) and the stupid logic forced on to the original cast, ruined it a bit for me.",

            "content": "After watching the original 2 seasons of Tokyo Ghoul I had high expectations of Tokyo Ghoul Re. My expectations were not only too high, but it was actually so bad I feel like I wasted my time even watching it. There is so much fighting (probably 10 of the 12 episodes were solid fighting), so little explanation, and absolutely terrible character development. The best part of this season was the Opening lol. If you had watched Tokyo Ghoul and Re side by side it's almost hard to believe they're made by the same people. The only reason I give it 5/10 and not 1/10 isbecause I'm hoping they connect things together better for season 2. I haven't read the manga but I can only imagine it's miles better from what I've heard.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul (anime) is a terrible adaptation in every way. Both this third part, like the other two. There's no way out, it's too bad.\r\nThe characters we met back there with the first part and the second \u221aA were already badly developed. Twelve episodes (24, added) with fights played on screen, bad dialogues and in the background a beautiful soundtrack that really surprises and serves as a mask for the grotesque mistakes of the anime.\r\nIn RE, you may think that those characters will be developed ... But they will not be. They are again played on the screen and you need to figure out whatis going on, since nothing is explained within the adaptation. Worst of all, it's that in addition to these characters, they've obviously put a lot more characters inside RE ... And again, they do not know how to develop any of them. It's all done quickly, launched on screen in twelve episodes to end soon.\\n\\n\r\nYou do not understand the reason of the characters, the background of each of them. The real motivation does not exist in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut okay, I can not speak only negatively of the anime. Let's try to find some good points in the series. The soundtrack falls level, but would hardly exceed the first two parts (especially the first). And between the three parts, I have for myself that it was in RE that we had some really worthwhile sentimental scenes (like Shirazu on his deathbed) and Urie feeling the death of Shirazu next to Saiko and Tooru. The scene in which Touka sticks with Haise for the first time sounds clumsy if we stop to think but deep down, I felt truthful in the moment and in the encounter between the two. Seconds before, we see Yomo already looking at Haise. We remember good moments of the scenes in the previous parts of the anime. A little nostalgia? Perhaps.\\n\\n\r\nThe final scene of episode twelve, in which Tsukiyama is 'cornered' by some GGC extras, is not bad either. Especially when we look up from the building and we see Touka next to Yomo doing his part and avoiding an end to Tsukiyama.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if we are to take into account (which would be right), the adaptation is very bad with these three parts released. It is well below average.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in every evaluation, we must carefully examine the whole context and this even serves an anime / manga.\\n\\n\r\nWe had all these changes in the staff and other 'adjustments' to adapt the anime and this corroborates not to leave a great adatap\u00e7\u00e3o. Tokyo Ghoul is an anime that suffered a lot with this and for certain issues ended up not having all its potential put into play.",

            "content": "I want to start this review by stating that this third season could have done anything and, it probably would have been better than Root A. \r\nTokyo Ghoul:re takes place three years after the events of the second season. We still follow Ken Kaneki now known as Haise Sasaki and his \"team\" known as the quinx squad who are half ghouls that were humans turned to ghouls by the CCG. The two main arc of this season are the auction and rose arcs. In the auction the CCG bust a ghoul auction where humans are sold and, the rose arc centers around Shuu Tsukiyama. Auctionwas just an excuse to have over the top action sequences but, they were absolutely phenomenal, it also served as a reincarnation of the character of Takizawa who graduated from the Trevor Philips school of insanity also, his battle with Kaneki was phenomenal. I liked the battle between the nutcracker and, Shirazu who was by far the most interesting member of this team that we are supposed to root for. However the best arc presented on Tokyo Ghoul television was Rose, I absolutely loved how they handled the character of Tsukiyama, watching him go from the pompous prick to emotionally broken was something else. Also, Tsukiyama in my opinion was the most compelling character in this season because he had motivation and, development which can't be said for certain characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe one constant with Tokyo Ghoul is its art. Characters design, action sequences and, locations were all beautifully animated. The ending theme to the show half became an ear worm after a while and, its upbeat tone was soothing after what the show had to offer. It was nice hearing unravel playing in an action sequence but, as much as I love that song they can't keep on reusing it. The opening song was completely forgettable but, the video package it had was really cool and, got me hyped for what was to come.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the Tokyo Ghoul anime was the lack of character development. I understand that with only twelve episodes of content some stuff is going to be cut or altered but, it should not be at the expense of character growth. Lets start off with kanji/Haise from the start of the show towards the end it felt like I was watching generic anime protagonist number 26 on screen. This is a result of vital material being cut/saved the only time he seemed interesting was when he had the conflict inside himself as a matter of fact I felt that if an entire episode was dedicated to just Kaneki and, Haise talking it would have been pure gold. I love what the did with his hair fading from white to black as he recovered pieces of his memory and, at the very last episode he essentially became the Punisher. I didn't like him much this season but, I'm excited to see what comes next. His team is composed of Urie, Shirazu and, two forgettable clowns that probable have less than thirty minutes of screen time combined. Urie is that one guy who wants to take on the world, be the best and, constantly monologues and, makes you ask yourself how is this guy employed. Shirazu on the other hand was the most interesting member of this group, his manner, look and, backstory made him a fully flushed out character and, he was the one member of this team that I wanted to see have a big moment which he did. As stated earlier Shuu Tsukiyama was easily the best character on this season and, his crew was also really cool particularly Kanae. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, certain characters are completely ignored, Hide is not mention or seen at all this season aside from a missing poster, we don't know what happened to Amon although we did briefly seem him and, he apparently joined Aogiri. Aogiri (Hinami, Atayo, Takizawa, Eto) the had a moment in the sun with the auction arc and, a meeting where some inner turmoil is established but aside from that and, their appearance at the last episode they were a non factor on the show. The crew from Anteiku basically have glorified cameos. The CCG stuff was an absolute bore, I honestly lost count of how many meeting were held throughout the season. Also, with certain action sequences or story elements they don't go all the way with it which always irritates me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this season had its ups and, downs. Its was fun watching characters grow and, watching the story progress. Some action sequences and, story themes were brilliantly executed such as how obsession leads to depression and, how we have to embrace our inner demons to overcome adversity. It was beautifully animated and musical sore wasn't bad. However, the show leaves much to be desired, unfilled plot point carried from previous seasons and, a group of protagonists that I couldn't care less about even if I tried. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude I would recommend watching Tokyo Ghoul:re if you are looking for mindless fun to kill time and, the rose arc is definitely with your time but, to me this will probably be a one shot anime that I will rewatch certain scenes of when I'm bored. I recommend watching Parasyte if you are looking for a more compelling and, freakier anime.\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m a huge fan of the manga series and I should say that this season might be one of the most faithful adaption we\u2019ve seen so far. Still, I can\u2019t really say I loved Tokyo Ghoul:re, like I loved the first season. This adaption seems to be lacking something, although I find it a bit hard to say what exactly. My best guess is that it just misses the atmosphere that came through so nicely in the manga.\r\nIn this season of Tokyo Ghoul, we meet Haise, a ghoul investigator who\u2019s working very hard to keep together his little family. Just like everyone (except Haise) notices,he\u2019s the former Kaneki and struggles with his other personality that just isn\u2019t a sweet snowflake like Haise himself. A lot of people say they hate Haise, but I kinda like his sweet, innocent side (I do like Kaneki better though).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Tokyo Ghoul:re follows the manga very closely, but just doesn\u2019t seem to have the same effect. Maybe it\u2019s because the animation is worse than ever before. Maybe it\u2019s because the voice acting ruined some scenes (please stop the Japanese sounding German/French, why would you do that to my ears?) and made them almost hilarious, while that obviously wasn\u2019t the intention. Maybe it\u2019s because the story is rushed. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s a big blank space after Tokyo Ghoul Root A. Maybe it\u2019s because the finale didn\u2019t really feel like something you would call a finale.\\n\\n\r\nSome scenes in the manga made my cry. The same scenes in this anime just leave me gazing at the screen, thinking: what the hell am I even watching? Characters I had no problems with in the manga suddenly became very hollow, not convincing and sometimes even annoying, though I just can\u2019t point out what has caused it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if the anime will continue to follow the manga, this might just be a necessary pain to go on to the better part of the series (and I really hope that it will turn out better than this season did, a girl can hope, can\u2019t she?)",

            "content": "I'm both a manga reader and anime watcher of the Tokyo Ghoul series. The adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul Re isn't even all that bad.\r\nIt was easy for me to understand the story because I've been reading the manga. As for anime only watchers, I guess it could get somewhat confusing. Haise Sasaki is introduced as the main character and I'm sure at least some people thought \"Where's Kaneki?\" or \"Who's this guy?\" This isn't a very big problem though since the answer to these questions are given pretty early in the anime. Another source of confusion is Tokyo Ghoul Root A. Some may have beenconfused as to whether or not this season was including the events of season 2. But, technically, Tokyo Ghoul Root A just took an alternative route to pretty much the same outcome. Some things were left out but the most important part was included at the very end of Root A. Anyway, people who only watched the anime should be able to put together at least a basic idea of what's going on. And the plot itself is good. I mean, what do you expect from an anime about ghouls and ghoul investigators? The answer would be ghoul investigators fighting and, well, investigating ghouls. That's exactly what we got plus some extra stuff. I will admit that I wish they included Kaneki's chin rubbing habit. It would've made that one scene earlier on much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself is good. I actually like it, especially when it comes to Tsukiyama. He looks so much better now than he did in seasons 1 and 2. The animation wasn't intolerable but it could've been better. During certain scenes, faces and movements look weird and it just sucks to have good moments interrupted like that. \\n\\n\r\nBut I am a bit disappointed with the soundtrack... Season 1 and 2 had amazing soundtracks and I really hoped that this season would include beautiful music as well. While I did like the music that they included, I expected more. I do really like the opening song though. The many different sounds form something beautiful and I love that. The ending song is pretty good too. And I really like how they brought back Unravel for that one episode. It tugged at my heartstrings until they broke and it left me sadder than I ever thought I'd be... As for the voice actors, they were good. I watched the dub version and I just absolutely love Austin Tindle. Everyone else sounded great but Kanae was a bit iffy. The voice actor had the French accent going on but I couldn't understand what they were saying at times.\\n\\n\r\nI like all the main characters but Saiko is the only one in Haise's squad who lacks something. She has a personality of some sort and has a motivation but there's no development or change. If you compare how Urie, Shirazu, and Haise were at the beginning to how they were at the end, you can notice some change. Saiko's a different story though. Oh, and Suzuya's different compared to how he was in the previous seasons so that's good. That certain incident has affected him and made him look at things differently. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nSound: 9 (Even though I was disappointed, there wasn't anything I didn't like.)\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (Despite everything, I didn't regret watching this one bit.)\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, this season could've been much better. Even though it may have been confusing for some people and some things weren't as good as they should've been, Tokyo Ghoul Re isn't bad in the slightest. I give it a 9.",

            "content": "I'm probably biased having read the manga already, but this isn't a very good anime or adaptation. \r\nPros:\r\n- The soundtrack\r\nCons:\r\n- Unpleasant fight scenes \r\n- Lazy animation\r\nOne of the only things I can enjoy about Tokyo Ghoul animations are the soundtracks they bring with them, whoever decides what songs they use is brilliant, I wish I could say the same about the animation and the fight choreography.\r\nI watched the prequel animations quite a while ago so I don't remember if the fights were always this goofy or not, but Tokyo Ghoul;Re has some pretty awful fights, at times it looks like a puppet show with charactersmaking stupidly inhuman movements. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it were just the ghouls moving inhumanly, but at times both the human and ghoul characters make very clunky movements that feel very out of place. Also be warned there are some pretty stupid sound effects in some fights. \\n\\n\r\nIt certainly doesn't help the animation is pretty below average, after reading the manga it's hard to look at this lazy mess and be satisfied but I tried my best. \\n\r\nThe three reasons I hate the animation are: \\n\r\nFirstly, the animation they use is quite a downgrade compared to the art from the manga, this is understandable as a much larger budget would be needed to replicate Sui Ishida's art style but I still wish there weren't so many still frames.\\n\r\nSecondly the animators often uses stock image like characters to make it seem like the scene is full when in reality it feels really hollow, I really dislike seeing the same cutout character over and over again. \\n\r\nAnd finally the excessive overuse of still frames with blood splattering around characters to give the illusion of a fight, I wish they would just animate something happening instead of these boring, practically still, frames. \\n\r\nOverall it feels like they really overuse cost cutting techniques so they don't have to animate as much.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: I wouldn't bother with this anime, you'd get a lot more enjoyment out of reading the manga in my opinion but to each their own.",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW HAS SOME SPOILERS*\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re takes place after the events of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, hopefully giving us more insight on what really went down after the hunt for the One-Eyed Owl. Unfortunately, this is not at all what we are given. TG:re instead gives us a look at Kaneki post-amnesia, recruited by the CCG and given a squad of artificial ghouls to help suppress the advances made by Aogiri.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nTG:re doesn't know where to focus its story, thus, we're left with a cesspool of plotholes and boredom. Aogiri is emphasized as a huge threat throughout the show, though, we hardly ever get any looksat how dangerous they've truly become until the final few episodes. Instead, we're left with Kaneki (who is actually Haise) struggling with a never-ending identity crisis, Kaneki's squad consistently whining about who's really in charge and who deserves authority, and Tsukiyama letting his family tear themselves apart without stepping in to do anything. Three things that I, and no one else really wanted. The title of the anime is Tokyo Ghoul:re, named after the cafe that Touka opened up at the end of Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA. With a title like that, I expected to see much more of Touka and crew, but they're practically nonexistent here. TG:re barely has a story, and even then, it is severely disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe Tokyo Ghoul series has always had impressive animation, art style, character design, and background displays. TG:re seemed a bit of downgrade in all of those aspects, but not to the point where it becomes hard to watch, in fact, I was still very much impressed by the design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nJust like the art, the music and voice acting is also extremely impressive. The opening always gets me hyped up for the show, even if it is severely lacklustre. As much as I dislike a lot of the characters in TG:re, I have to give credit where it is due with the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nWhere to start... TG:re has far too many characters to keep track of, most of which get killed off within seconds of their debut. Having a lot of characters isn't a bad thing, but there is a right and a wrong way to handle such a large cast. TG:re constantly tries to give us little quips or bits of backstory with nearly all characters we meet, just to kill them off without a second thought. I do not understand what the directors were aiming for here, but every death in TG:re brought nothing more than a yawn from my mouth. Hell, the main character, Haise, is probably one of the most forgettable characters. How do you make your mc incredibly disappointing? Even when Kaneki breaks free from Haise's chains, I still wasn't entertained, in fact, I was upset. Once Kaneki finally showed up, it didn't even feel like I was watching the same Kaneki from the past. Just a lifeless husk who lives by his own rules without a care for anyone but himself. He even attempts to kill his own friend out of nowhere for whatever reason. A lot of Kaneki's actions were random and felt incredibly out of place. Also, Haise's squad is just a team of cliches with overdone sob stories that just make us hate them even more. The characters in TG:re are forgettable and just incredibly underwhelming; I expected more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile the lack of story and disappointing character performances did ruin my experience with TG:re, I was still able to find enjoyment out of this show with the art and sound, both phenomenal. The fight scenes are colorful and wild as always and the music is always the perfect mood setter for whatever scenario we're given.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nIf you were a fan of Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, then don't expect too much from Tokyo Ghoul:re. If you enjoyed the fight scenes and music from Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul \u221aA, then you may find some enjoyment out of Tokyo Ghoul:re. Overall, Tokyo Ghoul:re is disappointing for fans looking for a more in-depth story at what happened in the past and what's to come, but still offers the incredible design and audio seen and heard throughout the series.",

            "content": "Right then. The much anticipated sequel to Tokyo Ghoul's root A has run it's course, and is getting a second season in the near future. What did I think of it? Well let's see...\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nOne of the main problems of Tokyo Ghoul:re is that it only caters to those who have read the manga. As someone who has only watched the anime, this made the story at times very dull and on several occasions hard to follow. I'll try and make this as spoiler free as possible, but in short, the story feels like it doesn't really know where it's going. Our protaganist Kaneki is,with little explanation, shown to us to now be a pretty senior Ghoul Investigator (Don't know why? Should've read the manga obviously) in charge of a team of other half ghouls. They go on multiple missions together, but all of them are rushed and much of it wont be understood by anime only watchers (did I mention this before?) and is mainly either for basic character progression, which I'll get to later, or for a weak build up to a confusing and anticlimatic ending which, although it clearly intended to, drew out no emotion for me while watching whatsoever. To sum it up, the story was boring and lacked any weight or significance to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was pretty solid, as was the animation, but in all honesty you'd expect it to be. Nothing stood out but nothing was lacking. I liked the design for a number of characters, particularly Haise (but still not sure how the fuck his hair works lol.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the sound was pretty solid, with a few stand out tracks here and there, though nothing on the level of glassy sky from Root A in my opinion. Pretty basic again, but the soundtrack did the job. If we're including voice acting here (Idk if I do, this is my first review lol) then all the actors did a serviceable job, though I would've liked to have heard more from the amazing Mamoru Miyano as Tsukiyama Shuu, given just how talented he is and based on what he's done with the character in the past.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhere to start... well, if I can give Studio Pierrot credit for one thing, it's that they at least tried this time round. The main characters have individual motives and drives, although they are extremely basic and clich\u00e9d. However, you may have noticed the word \"main\" in that sentence. This is because Tokyo Ghoul:re throws a  whole bunch of new characters into the mix who we are supposed to give a shit about, but who are barely expanded upon, similarly to Root A. None of them stick out in my memory, and are just sort of there for the story to use as it wants. I did admittedly enjoy the interaction between Haise and the rest of his team as well as his superiors, however. Basically, :Re shoves a boatload of new characters down our throats and expects us to swallow and enjoy, when we don't even get a chance to taste most of them. (That sounded a lot weirder than it meant to.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I usually find enjoyment even in anime that I consider to be bad. Naruto, Fairy Tail, heck even Root A had it's share of dynamic fight scenes that I could get into and at least understand what was going on. :Re however... just sort of happened. I watched it, and felt a bit of emptiness when it ended. Much of it just didn't click with me as an anime only watcher, and I think this was most of the reason, but that wasn't just it. The fight scenes just aren't that interesting, the story doesn't really go anywhere and what the fuck happened in that ending?? None of it was explained to me during the show to the extent that I had no knowledge of who must apparently be the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you actually bothered to read this review, then thanks, seems the late night might've been worth it :). But to conclude, Tokyo Ghoul:Re feels like it barely scratched the surface of the source material, and that's coming from someone who has never even read it. The characters and story are both weak, and I found little enjoyment in watching it, I can only hope that the second season delivers what the first didn't. Oh and if you didn't catch it during the rest of the review, this anime is not friendly to those who haven't read the manga ;)",

The main character which had very amazing character development in S1 & S2 was completely wiped out with only amnesia for Hasie Sasaki. Who is what I call, \"Kankei's Evolution #3\". From the beginning, I very much enjoyed the series but for the creator to make this was a great disappointment to my expectations.\r\nFor starters, the audience is greeted with a 2-year jump without any explanation of what happened or the new characters introduced. I one of my major complications with the anime is with Hasie's refusal to his true self. But hey, he doeswhat he does. Another question is \"What happened to the other characters over the years? Where have they gone?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, guess what? \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is a giant loophole to it that I can't even explain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was very disappointed with the outcome nothing more, nothing less.",

            "content": "Before I spit any words, let me first clarify that I have not read the Manga, and I do not plan to, I don't and didn't know any future plot points, the only knowledge I had about Tokyo Ghoul before watching this season was that of the two previous seasons.\r\nBack when I had just started watching anime, I got introduced to what became one of my favorite action anime, Tokyo Ghoul, I always consider myself lucky because I didn't start watching anime until a late phase, I had just finished the first season of Tokyo Ghoul, and to my surprise, the second season was alreadyreleased, this all was somewhere mid 2015, I didn't have to wait and taste and ordeal of that kind, but the same cannot be said on my time expecting a third season to drop. I sure took a time, but I never tried to spoil anything during that time, and so Tokyo Ghoul:re was released...\\n\\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re follow Ken Kaneki after the events of the second season, I don't intend to spoil any plot points in this review, but let's say, things changed, and the world is a lot more gruesome and challenging too, old enemies attained to their injuries and are back, and also are the Ken's friends.\\n\r\nAs somebody that never read the Manga, I really believe that this season was created with the idea in mind that everyone watching it would have already read the Manga, and thus will be able to keep up with the very fast-paced nature of the storytelling on this season, It really was a challenge to me to make up sense of what's happening most of the time, a lot of foreshadowing was present, a lot of dialog and action, but to mee, it still felt way too fast for me to be on the same page as the events were occurring.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (9.0/10):\\n\r\nBeautiful, almost tastable eye candy on your screen, this one would go up into my compilation of amazing art, and hold a solid spot somewhere on the top. the Tokyo Ghoul series has always had some great art and animation, but this season took it all to a whole next level with its breathtaking details and fluid animation, it was almost distracting from the yet complex and fast plot points.\\n\r\nI can at least appreciate the gore in this one, I like how they are not afraid to censor anything, but giving us all of the gruesomeness we deserve.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (7.0/10):\\n\r\nI'd say, the sound production was at its most average form, the voice actors did their best, but it still didn't connect to me at the end, I didn't really like the opening song, but the end was great.\\n\r\nAgain, the voice acting really was just as messy as the fast paced action, I could have sworn that if I had read the Manga first and then watched the season I would hvae grasped what's happening a lot better.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (6.0/10):\\n\r\nOk, this is where I drew the line, I was okay with the character roster of the earlier seasons, but this was just too much, not that the new characters were bad or anything, but it was just too much, way too overkill for a short season as far as 12 episodes go, I had just taken a long enough break from Tokyo Ghoul to be greeted with loads and loads of new characters, it was a real challenge remembering their names, or even on which side they are, looking how most of them where similarily looking to one another.\\n\r\nI would have loved if it had a smaller character roster because, for newcomers who never read the Manga, it feels more like a chore to keep up than actual entertainment.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\\n\r\nI really was disappointed after finishing this season, I never felt hyped up at the part that I was supposed to, I never cried or felt sad or even connected with any of the characters, I was just sitting in front of a screen trying to understand what's going on most of the time, not really hating it, but not praising it either. I would probably do better with a rewatch, but that's something for another day.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.2/10):\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul:re was a let down for me, I would suggest that you rewatch the two first seasons if it's been a while since you last saw them, because trust me, you will need to know all the prior information you can grasp at once, if you already read the Manga, I believe you'll find this one entertaining than I did, seeing those cool panel moments animated will definitely pay off with this new smooth animation, good luck.",

Not only does Tokyo Ghoul: Re leave you with \"wtf is going on\" It also leaves you with disappointment and boredom.

What this season has done was made the cliffhanger of the previous season more known but unknown. What I mean is they have given good explanations for many of the characters but not enough to reveal all the juicy secrets of what happened. That to me is how this anime survives and blooms to become more dramatic, action-packed, and to continue to be the very intriguing story not for just one character but every character involved. The Art Style I would say isvery different from the previous seasons which might come as a shock to many Tokyo Ghoul Purists. As you continue to watch you will end up getting used to the art style because it doesn't affect how good the story is. What I like about this anime is how good it is staying within a good amount of the manga and not straying far from the origins.\\n\r\nThis Anime has made a name for itself and continues to prove that Tokyo ghoul is more than humans v.s. ghouls or ghouls against the world. And it always leaves you wanting more.",

            "content": "Tokyo Ghoul: re is a prime example of an adaptation that deserved better but didn't suck either.\r\n--SPOILERS--\r\nTokyo Ghoul has its fair share of variety between adaptation strength. The first season in my opinion was very strong and solid with changes from the manga being done in a relatively fair way. The art was fantastic and the soundtrack was goosebump  inducing. The second season, root a, was disappointing to say the least where the changes from the manga were almost entirely harmful, but retained good enough animation and a good soundtrack. \r\nAfter several years comes re, from the famous sequel manga. As a reader ofthe manga i was curious how they would be able to continue the story without much of the setup that was skipped in root a. I will say, Pierrot surprised me and managed to just leave the story as was as if root a never happened, and that worked in this adaptations benefit. Unfortunately many anime only viewers were confused, but manga readers could help clarify for the curious. The issue was with the inconsistency in character priority. This season could have used an extra episode, because although many episodes were very faithful to the manga, certain characters who already were glossed over in root a, were again glossed over (I'm looking at Suzuya in particular). \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about re, was the animation. The animation was inconsistent and fight scenes were much worse than even root a. There were times I felt like i was watching an anime from the early 2000's with the still frames. This anime deserved a better staff or a better budget, perhaps both. This was massively disappointing because my biggest grievance with the manga was not being able to tell what exactly was happening in the fights, and i desperately hoped the anime would fix that, but except for rare occasions the animation was entirely lackluster and often downright awful compared to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and soundtrack were good. I enjoyed the opening very much and it grew on me more over time. The ed was decent, and the ost was pretty good, although sometimes misused. I felt the lack of ost in a certain death scene in the final episode was a smart way to make it more impactful. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment of this series was just fine. It wasn't bad, not nearly as bad as root a, but it was damn disappointing to see the animation and art quality drop so dramatically. The story is good enough, but backstories are glossed over too quickly to really be lasting. It was not a waste of time to watch this season, but it was entirely unnecessary for any manga reader. Studio pierrot should devote a franchise with so much support a more experienced staff or a greater budget, as I'm not sure which was the more predominant issue.",

            "content": "I'm going to refer to this season as Tokyo Ghoul 3, but by doing so I also feel like im doing something unjust.\r\nThis season is barely anything alike the first 2 entries, which were very closely tied in terms of quality. A lot of people dislike the fact of how season 2 diverted from its source material, but the divergence certainly doesn't leave a bad taste after watching. More importantly, I believe that an anime adaptation does NOT have to do \"Justice\" to the source material. It's important for me personally to think this way since there are a lot of garbage mangas which couldpotentially have a great anime adaptation if pacing, scenes and in some cases the entire story is tweaked. Consecutively, the adaptation for Tokyo Ghoul 2 tied up the story and could've ended there quite neatly, it didn't really leave a big gap for a direct sequel but ended on a strong note instead.\\n\r\nTokyo Ghoul 3 does leave a bad taste however. Regardless of how it follows the manga, this series does not live up to the standards of the first 2 entires. The pacing is all over the place, Animation goes from garbage to mediocre and art is inconsistent in quality between characters. It's so inconsistent that I barely know what the actual plot is about, but that might be a bad way to put it.\\n\r\nIt's more accurate to say \"The script for what has happened the 8 episodes I've watched has been complete shit.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet me expand on a few details to further my point.\\n\r\nThe first 2 entries gave us a hint about \"Power level\", which is essential to any series with a limited amount of relevant characters where the main plot is a conflict which results in battles. The \"owl\" was feared by the CCG for being powerful, and his power (albeit weaker) was properly shown in the 2 fights he participated in. The MC grew in power over the course of the series as he would've in most shounen, and we could \"kind of\" tell how powerful he was by the end considering his fight with Amon.\\n\r\nIn the new entry, powerlevel barely matters, plot armor without justification  decides if a character wins or loses and instead of individualizing characters they introduce new concepts of kagune \"Detached\", and introduce some new pseudo owl and super powerful previously never mentioned investigators. On top of all that, most characters from the previous entries have had both their personalities and looks completely altered.\\n\r\nI got the assumption that the \"owl\" was a unique ghoul, such as \"rabbit\" or \"eye-patch\", a name created from either how they looked or the mask they used. The new owl was apparently \"Created\" the same way kaneki was, and looks like a corpse with a cowl, small as a human and not even resembling what was previously called \"The Owl\".\\n\r\nThe rankings for ghouls have also been inflated for some reason, Nishiki is an \"SS rated\" ghoul who is beat up instantaneously by Kaneki \"SS\" for something like comedic relief in the first episode.\\n\r\nThe last nail in the coffin is the way kagunes look. Unless they are from specific previously existing characters, they all look precisely the same as one another. \\n\\n\r\nThat about sums it up. The show is not AWFUL, but instead of competing with \"7.85 shows\" on MAL, it sits at a very low 7 or high 6, all things considered.",

I feel like Haise Sasaki. \r\nI'm only 5 episodes in as I write this (that's how many are out at the time of writing). \r\nThis isn't the 3rd season I expected. Also, I haven't read the manga past the first arc. But I rewatched the first two seasons before starting this one, and I feel disconnected. Like they are picking it up from a different spot all together. It feels like there is A LOT we are missing between end of S2 and start of S3, and it doesn't feel like they are working on filling in those blanks. \r\nSeason2 jumped in right where we left off, and all the characters maintained their appearance and animation style. But Season 3... I'm confused as to who is who. I assumed Haise was Ken Kaneki but he looks completely different in style and the way he was animated. Suzuya has died his hair... I guess? Or maybe it was always supposed to be black? Nothing is mentioned about this change. The new characters making up the Quinx squad feel like they are from a different anime all together. The pointy teeth guy, the different style eyes on every one, the Umaru style lazy girl. I could go on, but I'll stop.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks pretty, the story isn't hard to follow, characters are fine. But overall, this feels like a complete \"do over\" instead of a continuation of the Tokyo Ghoul anime franchise. Seems like there is an OVA or movie I totally missed that would answer things between S2 and S3, or maybe they are just waiting to clear it up later. \\n\\n\r\nBut as the classic youtube video \"Tokyo Ghoul in 5 minutes\" says: \"This probably makes sense in the manga\". Maybe if I read the manga all the way I would understand better what the heck is happening and why. \\n\\n\r\nI'll finish the season, it's not horrible, but it's not what I expected. The change in animation and character design are the most problematic for me.",

Would i have liked some things differently? Yes. Am i complaining they weren't in that way? No, becauseI really really enjoyed this 3rd season, both of its parts very much actually.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, if you plan to watch it or have already watched it, try to look at it from only the anime's point because it's worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, yes I really loved it. Would I recommend it? 100%",
