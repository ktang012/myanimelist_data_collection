            "content": "The original Prison School is probably the most impressive ecchi manga I have ever read. By impressive I don't just mean that it's enjoyable, but rather that it accomplished something that I sincerely didn't believe was possible. It manages to tell a story with hilarious comedy and incredibly lewd ecchi scenes, but at the same time also have a legitimately suspenseful and interesting plotline, *without* making those aspects feel incompatible. I don't think I have ever seen such a smooth and natural way of merging serious and non-serious elements anywhere else where it actually succeeds on both fronts.\r\nNow the anime covers the entirety of thefirst arc of the manga, which tells the story of five boys who enroll in a previously all-girls boarding school which has just become co-ed. However, many of the female students are still disgusted at the notion of having men as their fellow classmates, and a certain vigilante organization within the school called the Underground Student Council decide to take the matter into their own hands. The group consists of the manipulative president Mari, the voluptuous and sadistic vice president Meiko, and the rather violent crazy person Hana who's also got a quite peculiar fetish to say the least. They set a trap for the boys where they manage to frame them for peeping, and consequently send them all off to live inside a small prison located on the school courtyard. And thus, their new life of hell begins as they are forced into manual labor under Meiko's relentless whipping, and they constantly have to be on their guard against the USC's foul play and attempts at getting the boys expelled for good. Meanwhile, the boys try to channel their inner Andy Dufresne as they start to dream about breaking out of prison...\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that needs to be said about this anime is that it doesn't hold anything back. Like not in the slightest. Among other things it features hardcore masochism, a principal obsessed with asses, misunderstandings about two of the guys supposedly being gay for each other, cross dressing, golden showers, a guy shitting himself in class, a girl who sweats about 50 liters per day, a myriad of sexual innuendos, non-stop femdom, epic speeches about the stupidest things imaginable and god knows what else. There are no breaks on this pain train and you better be prepared for what you're getting yourself into when deciding to watch Prison School, because it is rather... crude, to say the least. But crude or not, the execution is stellar, and it rarely fails to make you laugh with how blunt it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all highly exaggerated in their behavior, but given the crazy atmosphere of the show it fits perfectly. Our main character Kiyoshi is energetic and dedicated, Gakuto is the best bro ever, Andre is a huge masochist, Joe is infatuated with ants and Shingo is an American delinquent. And of course they're all perverts, whether they admit it or not, but at least they're perverts with class... well discounting Andre that is. Speaking of which, the ecchi elements in Prison School are not to be underestimated. It has scenes you will probably never see anywhere else other than in hentai. But it doesn't come across as needless fanservice at all; rather it either makes it humorous or just plain epic, especially anything starring Kiyoshi and Hana in the same room is a sight for sore eyes. It's something you really need to see for yourself to understand. Of course the TV-airing of Prison School is censored like almost every ecchi anime is these days, but since the sexual content is mostly there for the sake of comedy rather than arousal I don't really find it all that distracting anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as pacing goes though, there are some issues. The anime covers 81 chapters' worth of content in just 12 episodes, which is quite a lot of story in not too much time. As a result, the transitions in-between scenes are oftentimes done extremely quickly, which means that a lot of the jokes don't really have time to sink in properly before the story moves on to the next segment. There's also the fact that many of the characters actually talk *very* fast, which might just be another way of saving time. So in that sense it is a pretty rushed adaptation, but I think it gets gradually better the longer it goes on, and honestly even despite the fast pacing it still works out fairly smoothly most of the time. A few episodes more would have done wonders though.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga is notorious for its unusually detailed and realistic-looking art style for an ecchi series, and the anime follows the same idea. I don't think it looks quite as crisp as the original art does, but it still gets the job done and gives you a pretty fresh outlook on the genre. The voice acting is also very on-point. Kamiya Hiroshi's performance fits Kiyoshi's character like a glove, probably because he shares a lot of traits with Araragi Koyomi from the Monogatari Series whom Hiroshi has also voiced. Seeing Hanazawa Kana of all people do the role of Hana might be a bit more unexpected though given her absolutely crazy persona, but she actually does an absolutely phenomenal job at it. I also have to give Konishi Katsuyuki a shout-out for his voicing of Gakuto's character; it was truly a special experience to listen to and a very impressive performance overall.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is an anime with a very unorthodox combination of genres and styles, and an even rarer case of one which actually does it successfully. It stands out for its hilariously exaggerated scenes, its crazy characters and its ability to do literally *anything* without holding back for even a second. Is it a show for everyone? No, but I still think it's targeting a much larger audience than first impressions may lead you to believe. It's a highly entertaining series from start to finish, and while I still prefer the manga version, it's definitely an anime worth checking out, even if only to see just what the hell is actually going on in it.",

            "content": "First, I\u2019m going to have to say what Prison School is about. Because I\u2019m honestly still trying to wrap my head around the concept and the hundreds of planning paper I bought at Office Depot isn\u2019t helping. In some weird universe where parental absence is even more out-of-place than normal by anime standards, there is a private girls\u2019 academy called Hachimitsu (not gonna dignify that name with a response) that has recently started to admit boys for no particular reason like some gender-reversed version of Zoey 101. However, Hachimitsu is an academy that\u2019s far from being suitable for the Nick-audience viewing.\r\nIt\u2019s a harsh place wherethe most minor of infractions will cause you to get treated like a literal prisoner complete with wearing the stereotypical white and black outfits or face expulsion, which is something the five boys who transferred to the academy learn the hard way after making the stupid mistake of trying to peek into the girls\u2019 locker room. Although why they\u2019d want to is beyond me, considering every single girl in this show is less sexually appealing than Bayonetta in clown make-up. In fact, come to think of it, what exactly happens to these boys after they get expelled, considering they don\u2019t exactly seem to be learning anything as is? Well, it turns out they want to stay so they can see a girls\u2019 wet T-shirt contest that\u2019s supposed to occur sometime in the future. Something I find very hard to believe actually exists in this academy - which is quite a feat considering everything else that goes past the headmaster\u2019s eyes.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is an incredibly difficult show to summarize because it seems like it was based on somebody\u2019s Madlibs and the guy who filled it out was off his meds that day. I get that it\u2019s supposed to be combining prison exploitation films with the standard \u201canime harem/school\u201d tropes, but some things just don\u2019t combine, like the Hercules legend and Michael Bolton. Every single element of the series is so contradictory to another element that I have a hard time trying to find out what I\u2019m supposed to be caring about and more importantly, what I\u2019m supposed to laugh at. So the vice-president punishing the boys for being perverted shows ample amounts of cleavage in school? These girls hate the male form and yet they\u2019re open with showing their vaginas to them and the audience at every opportunity? There\u2019s a guy who really loves ants to the point that he\u2019d die for them? There is a gun in my drawer with a special mechanism that only fires the trigger if I\u2019m pointing it up my nose?\\n\\n\r\nOh sorry. My head was getting overwhelmed and I was thinking for a fast way to clear some thoughts. This whole show plays out like a South Park episode that was stretched to twelve times the length and stripped of all the life, memorable characters, great movie parodies, and subversive topical humor that still played by the rules even when it showcased a magician entertaining kids by sawing his penis off and hiding it behind a kid\u2019s ear, causing it to fall into the same lifeless monkey cheese the shows it tries to parody fall into. Get past the presentation and all Prison School is is another goddamn story about the opposite sex trying to fit into a same-sex school and discovering what qualifies as romance in this medium whilst being about character types rather than characters. And unless you\u2019re one of those people who really like over-the-top art styles, you\u2019ll get tired of the presentation real fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor relies entirely on overreacting, awkward situations that the characters narrate to the point that the joke overstays its welcome (which is any length of time above zero seconds), or just being nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical. And unusually for a Tsutomu Mizushima anime - and especially compared to JC Staff\u2019s other perverted comedy that aired in the same season - the comedic timing is completely awful, so forget laughing. I know Funimation has never been above being a little liberal with translations, but poking the bear aside, I find it very hard to believe that video games even exist in this universe. And once that thought entered my mind, the shock chuckle I got from seeing that became like the shock chuckle of seeing a piece of wood stuck down someone\u2019s sphincter: incapable of provoking an emotion from me other than confusion.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this show isn\u2019t the least bit as edgy or gritty as it thinks it is. It\u2019s more like a desperate dad trying to make his baby smile by stretching his face out and go \u201cabloogeewoogeewoo\u201d. And when that\u2019s not working, he tells the kid about all the fucked-up things he saw in the world like a twelve-year old who doesn\u2019t know any better. Who\u2019s the baby at that point, huh old man?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this stupid conversation between the male students and their principal in which he\u2019ll allow them to stay a little longer if they can tell him whether or not boobs or asses are better and why that is. The punchline is supposed to be that being perverted gets you rewarded, which I think has only been used in at least ten different gross-out comedies, as well as every Kevin Smith film ever. Most of all, I don\u2019t even care about the semantics regarding which is better. It\u2019s a dumb conversation to have in real life and it\u2019s dumb in fiction.\\n\\n\r\nAnother memorable attempt at the show\u2019s desperation was when the closest thing to a male lead tried to sneak out of the school in order to show up for a date. Let\u2019s be generous for now and say we give two shits for if he actually shows up or not, but the attempts at hiding his break-out are just pathetic because it\u2019s very obvious he won\u2019t get caught until the episode ends at the very least, and the punchline is always that he avoids getting caught due to last-minute circumstance that\u2019s too weird to be funny. I\u2019ll admit to smiling a bit at the defecation radio because that actually seemed possible in reality, but that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the biggest thing that got to me was the finale. First off, it was incredibly obvious who was going to win in the end and the plan to achieve said end was pretty damn simplistic in of itself with virtually no twists to the formula or any attempt to make the characters less boring resulting from it. And yet the show drags the plan out for three episodes just so it can cram in a hundred more overlong \u201coh shit, I saw a woman\u2019s privates\u201d joke whenever it spots an opportunity to do so whilst tying up loose ends that quite frankly missed the mark for payoff ages ago. Yeah, South Park itself has a tendency to overreach, but not to this extent.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, I won\u2019t spoil the final result, but I felt nothing for anybody after everything was wrapped up, and not just because of the rampant yet confusing sexism. Because at the end of the day, nothing\u2019s changed aside from certain circumstances. The characters have achieved nothing, learned nothing, will never be remembered for anything, and have certainly not learned how to be funny to anyone older than twelve. All the suffering they went through? What exactly was the point of it all? Please tell me. I\u2019m dying to know.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard some people who acknowledge this show\u2019s problems by saying it gets by on the tension. As we\u2019ve covered before regarding Detroit Metal City, I find this impossible to feel when the show has an over-the-top style that is ALWAYS on. It NEVER takes a break to have the characters actually act human or feel like they\u2019re in real danger. Imagine if the intrigue in Gurren Lagann was dealt with using the same \u201cwho the hell do you think I am/raw raw fight the powah\u201d atmosphere as mostly everything else in that show. We\u2019d think Imaishi wasn\u2019t taking the audience seriously, or that Baz Luhrmann somehow broke into the industry. When they say style can be substance, they don\u2019t mean keep the style on 24/7. Because even the most powerful religious symbolism gets old if you just hammer in the same verse over and over.\\n\\n\r\nNo likable characters, no funny jokes, not a lick of sense regarding anything that happens, and whatever tension that\u2019s supposed to exist throughout the series is undermined by the fact that I\u2019m watching a bunch of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys rejects constantly trying to perform bad stand-up comedy. Final grade? Utterly forgettable.",

            "content": "Prison School is by far my favorite anime this season! I'm a big fan of Great Teacher Onizuka and it's the first time in years I've had the same kind of enjoyment watching a comedy. I'm usually not a big fan of over-sexualized female characters or harem animes but prison school is an exception.\r\nStory 9/10\r\n5 perverted teenagers end up in a school full of girls. They peak into the girls bath and get grounded into a prison set in the middle of the campus. These 5 guys are hilarious, one is fat as fuck, one is creepy as fuck, one is geeky as fuck... Thegirls in charge of them AKA the Underground School Council, bully them, torture them, insult them. This kind of treatment gives them boners lol\\n\r\nAll the comical elements that build up in the series are pretty similar to what would happen in GTO in these kind of weird sexual moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is flawless. The action scenes are fast paced and you never get bored. Great attention to detail. Nothing bad to say about it. Character design is fine too and there's a lot of panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\neeeeh, not a fan of the opening or ending. For the sake of giving Prison School a 10/10 I'll just give the sound a 10. The voice acting is awesome though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nAMAZING. The 5 guys are funny as hell, the MC kyoshi is kinda lovable and cute while his friends are just creepy sexual weirdos. Since they're always stuck together they create great bonds and funny homoerotic quiproquos. The girls in charge of the prison are as fucked up as the guys.\\n\r\nAND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SCHOOL DESERVES AN AWARD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nYou will not get bored.

            "content": "Prison School is a good anime, although it sometimes fails to play to its strengths and descends into pointlessness. \r\nI don't look to anime for sexual gratification; so when I criticize the censorship, I'm not doing it out of blue-balled resentment. (Well, not just that anyway.) It detracts from the quality of the animation, and it's often just unnaturally forced into the scene, to cover things that don't really need to be covered. They can indirectly depict urolagnian debauchery but they draw the line at panty-shots? Prison School has nice animation, but it's difficult to appreciate this when so much of it is censored. \r\nHonestly,I kind of wish there wasn't quite so much sex-appeal. I want to be able to just watch and laugh without having to make the sign of the cross every three seconds. A lot of it was just for the purpose of humor, but when we got into territory that was more clearly aimed at arousal, it got a bit more uncomfortable. The series could have been better if it stopped trying to tickle my boner and started focusing solely on tickling my funny bone. (I can tickle my own boner, thank you very much.)\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how Prison School could have been better, the characters were something of a minefield placed over a gold mine. Characters like Hana, Vice President, the Principal guy, Kiyoshi, Joe, and Gakuto were great. But then there's characters like that one guy who had no personality, but got kind of pissy sometimes and that's all we really know about him so how can I really be expected to know his name, and Mari, who I find to be rather flat compared to characters like the Vice President. (Haha. Flat.) And then there's Andre. He is filth. He is the most disgusting character, the most repulsive thing, that I have ever seen in any anime. No, in anything. Every time he was on the screen, I felt tears welling in my eyes and beginning to drip down onto my cheeks as my body shook with dry heave after dry heave after vomiting fit. The creator of this character should be shot. Or just killed. I suppose it doesn't matter how. But he must be brutally murdered (or just murdered, I'm not picky) before he releases another Andre into the world. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's a testament to the strength of the best characters that the presence of Andre does not result in an automatic 1. Instead, the good, borderline non-existent, and terrible characters balance each other out. I just wish we saw some characters more often. (Like Hana. I want more.) \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is absurd; it barely exists, and what is there is ridiculous, but it still maintains somewhat of a sense of internal consistency, and it works. The premise is bizarre, and a lot of the plot developments just make it weirder, but it has a beautiful sense of logic to it that would make Hegel turn green with envy as he realized the insignificance of his boring collections of meaningless compound words. \\n\\n\r\nBut whatever. You should probably forget everything I've said up until now. And I mean everything. Forget everything I've ever said in my life. The most important thing is that Prison School is very funny. It could have been better in a lot of aspects, but it succeeds in entertaining its audience. It's unique and hilarious. You won't find anything else like it, and it's not easy to find anything funnier. If you watch it, you will laugh, unless you suck. It's a comedy; it's comedic. There you go. It's a success.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the gags can get very repetitive, (Despite the changing of details and introduction of some new sexual situation, it's still the same damn joke. And somebody needs to tell the mangaka that a running gag isn't just a copy-and-paste thing; you actually have to be creative to keep it funny.) but they don't quite over-stay their welcome. A lot of the time, when Prison School seemed to get stale, it changed just enough to keep you going for another episode. But, towards the end it really isn't that funny anymore. Not laugh-out-loud funny anyway. Ramping up the vulgarity does not equate to increasing the funniness, and it's sort of a cheap tactic.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of watching this anime, you should probably just read the manga. Think about it. It covers a lot more of the story, it has minimal censorship, and the panel format sometimes lends itself to better comedic timing. (Mostly just the first two.) And what did it really gain in the adaptation? The boring OP and ED? I am unimpressed. But if you absolutely refuse to read manga, then that's fine too. I would still recommend the anime, provided that you know what you're getting into. \\n\\n\r\nA 7 seems about right for Prison School. It is very flawed, but the entertaining parts are entertaining enough for me to call it 'good.' It's certainly better than a lot of other anime out there.",

            "content": "You\u2019re probably thinking what does \u201cprison\u201dand \u201cschool\u201d have to do with each other? Isn\u2019t prison where criminals go to and school is where people get an education? Prison School sort of works differently. When the ratio of girls to guys is around 20:1, then you know your school has something that\u2019s worth more than just education. Of course, I\u2019m referring to the elite boarding school known as Hachimitsu Academy.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series was long sought to get an anime adaptation at some point. And when it did, there were concerns about how it should be adapted. The concerns includesthe amount of censorship or material omitted as a show like this may not be suitable to air on TV. And that\u2019s pretty obvious to tell as well. Prison School is literally like a fan service extravaganza. No less than 30 seconds into the first episode and you\u2019ll realize it why. However, I would also describe Prison School more as a comedy thriller, a show that satirizes fan service itself. Sounds a bit odd right? If you\u2019re interested, keep reading on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story involves 5 boys. They are Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Shingo, and Andre. Kiyoshi is sort of the primary protagonist among them although all of them get spotlight in the story some way or another. Regardless, the school they are attending has over 1000 girls and they are some of the few guys. While this seems like some sort of heavenly dream coming true, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. It turns out, there\u2019s a strong female dominance and authority at the school. This mainly composes of the Underground Student Council made of an elite group of female characters such as Mari, Hana, and Meiko. Their main intention is to get the boys expelled and throughout the show, we see how far they go. To say the least, the Underground Student Council is ridiculously powerful. They seem to have absolute rule over the school and anyone who fails to abide by their authority will pay the consequence. This is where the prison part comes in as people get locked up. For its purpose, the show often portrays the women abusing the boys while the main characters tries to make the most of their time there. Remember what I said about fan service earlier? That part easily comes to play when most of the female characters are sexualized throughout the story. Take Meiko for example. She is one of the Student Council members and often punishes the boys through extreme form of sadism such as whipping, brutalizing, and beating up the boys to get satisfaction. Andre is mostly the victim of her assaults although there\u2019s implications that he secretly enjoys it. While all this seems a bit over-the-top notch, I dare say that its performance is more like a thriller. The comedy is the fan service while the thriller is how much the boys can take the mental and physical abuse. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, most if not all the boys are perverts. Kiyoshi is probably the tamest of them and probably also the most normal character in the show. His crush on Hana, a secretary of the Student Council, often lands him into controversial positions. Despite this, Kiyoshi is an honest guy and stands firm as a character that most others contrast in this series. The other boys also show some delicacy when it comes to their own personalities but none of them come close to him. A good amount of emphasis is also placed on some of their interactions with female characters. While most of them are victims of the characters, there are some that achieve a bit of closure. For instance, we have Shingo\u2019s relationship with Anzu that seems to develop into some genuine love. Kiyoshi\u2019s relationship with Hana also has some bits of innocence although given the nature of the show, it\u2019s mostly satirized by fan service. \\n\\n\r\nAs fan service dedicates the style of Prison School, the plot has less of a focus. The story is actually pretty simple and prison breaking is part of its plot element. It\u2019s exactly as the premise implies and follows it pretty accurately. When it comes to adaptation faithfulness, there\u2019s some obvious content that is omitted while the story itself is rushed. On the other hand, the adaptation does an explicit job with its comedy. I can\u2019t remember how many times I laughed when watching this show. This is set by Prison School\u2019s high standards of crafting ridiculousness. It\u2019s as if the fan service is alive and self-aware. Cameras are deliberately focused to highlight moments when boobs are bounced or when crotch shots are shown in close view. There\u2019s also some comedic symbolism such as with the mushroom or Medusa that really create a sensational satire. So in essence, Prison School knows its intentions and isn\u2019t shy at all from hiding it. If you want to be serviced, this is where it\u2019s at. \\n\\n\r\nBy adaptation standards, the artwork is crude but in a good way. For some reason, Madhouse decided to toughen it up a notch and make the boys look more ripped than their manga counterparts. Similarly, the female characters show all sort of juicy body parts. As the show is saturated by fan service, there\u2019s almost endless amount of it. There\u2019s also both a censored and uncensored version so watch at your own discretion. In the meantime, the series\u2019 school looks normal except with the establishment of the prisons. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Prison School\u2019s success comes from the characters. It takes a strong cast to convince the audience of realism of the setting. Thankfully, the cast pulls it off. Character reactions matches in par with the voice in particular during torture scenes. Yes, torture scenes. This is when the boys get their mental and physical abuse from the Underground Student Council. The voices screams both pain and pleasure as it convinces the audience of their complication. On a lesser scale, the OST and theme songs are much more standard although I will say that some of the symbolism portrayed in the OP theme song is cleverly done. The OST also gets some thrilling moments in particularly some of the later episodes as the boys gets more desperate to fight back.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the endgame for a show like this? My advice is to give the first 5 minutes a try. If you can last that long, then you\u2019ll have an easy time watching the series. Be aware that fan service is endless and you may forget at times what the story is actually about. Regardless if you\u2019re an anime-only or manga veteran, Prison School accurately adapts its comedy with the character reactions. Unfortunately, the show is only a 1-cour so do expect content to be omitted. (there\u2019s a \u201cteaser\u201d for a potential second season though) Whether these may be something appealing or a personal favorite will be left in the dust. Despite that, Prison School in the end is a fun show. It\u2019s fun enough to not only portray fan service in an overwhelming way but one that makes you come back for more.\\n",

            "content": "Prison school is in fact a great example of bad show with great elements. Prison School successfully takes suspense, drama, action, and ecchi, turns them into one perfect mess. Prison School is also a great example of a \"Hit or Miss\" anime show. Meaning you either like it or don't like it depending or your personal tastes in anime and experience.  The story is sort of plain however the elements they add like violence, sexy scenes, drama, suspense etc literally makes the a bit non existent. There are many things I like about story though, but for now the thing that stood out themost was the fact that (and stated before) the show overall was so bad it's good. The soundtrack is awesome lots of rock and metal added to make action scenes and \"Uh oh i'm in trouble\" scenes more suspense. The characters, will never, ever be forgettable. Prison school has one of the best cast of unforgettable characters I have seen in a while. Hana (she's first because she was my favourite) Kiyoshi, the vice president, the Chairman of the school, just about everyone is unforgettable. You, the viewer, if Prison school is up you alley and you enjoy bizarre shows this show is indeed for you. Overall I think the show was Really, really good given the elements and story the creator and directors were working with. 8/10",

Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive :D\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nPrison School is all about 5 guys in a school for girls that are caught peeping in the girl's bathroom, and are sent to a prison in the middle of the school. Pretty normal, huh? You've seen nothing yet lmao. I gave the story \"just\" an 8 because  the storyline had some ups and downs, as after episode 7, the whole plot is left a bit unconsistent, but recovering later on.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nWhat makes Prison School sucha good show is the animation. I was extraordinary suprised by how each character's face is done to emphasize how they are feeling in each moment, not to mention the smoothness throughout the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing special to say here. Music was pretty sweet, especially the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nDid I say animation was what made the show good? HAH. Characters in the show are just the most hilarious thing EVER. Normally when seeing the show, I would almost laughh just by seeing their weird ass face. But what really stands out for me is the fact that you are always mind fucked by everything they do, combined with a great sense of humor (plus animation). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say. I've enjoyed every single chapter in the whole show, and not only would I watch the chapter every single week but also be thinking about it for the next days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Prison School can be defined by one word: awesome. i didn't give it a 10 because of the post-escape storyline, but overall, I would recommend this great anime to almost everyone.",

Even if the show was vile and disturbing, it was entertaining to watch during my free time. \r\nI thought of the vice president as an overly sexualized character, but thats what makes it even funnier. The sexual scenes make the anime look like a hentai animehonestly. Overall, I have nothing to say about this anime other than it was one of the most hilarious anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Prison school is a weird one for me. That's mostly due to because I absolutely despise ecchi / harem / blah, blah generic titillating content that's incredibly common in anime. And that might be why I enjoyed the show to a certain extent. It takes the idea of fanservice and stretches to a very specific and fetishized realm that it can end up being hilarious to some people or, at least, intriguing because the absurdity of it.\r\nThat said, besides a couple of moments spread out far and between I wasn't laughing or let alone chuckling as much as I heard I was going to be.Some jokes are repeated or just go for a bit too long which ends up at times being slightly annoying. The story isn't much either; Do me a small favor and read the synopsis of this show. Did it? That's the entire show but stretched to 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSure, some things happen here and there, but it follows a very simple formula. People do things, people get punished for doing those things, the end. Which sure, is fine and dandy as long as the characters are interesting, but besides two out of the three crazy dominatrixes, the entire cast is pretty forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a perverted boy band of main characters; The first being the standard, boring anime dude, second, the nerdy guy, third, the tough guy, fourth, the fat one and last but not least, the wimpy weird one. Like I said, besides two out of the crazy trio the characters are pretty darn boring. \\n\\n\r\nBut I still enjoyed the show, I mean is not great, but is not bad either. Is a good time waster if you have nothing else to do and hey if you want to see an incredibly over-the-top and fetishized version of your standard ecchi wank-off fest, check it out. Worst case scenario is that you wasted your time by reading this review and hated the show thanks to my weird yes and no recommendation for the thing. What do you have to lose!? \\n",

            "content": "[8.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSo I didn't expect to like Prison School nearly as much as I did. In fact, this may be one of the best anime series I've seen thus far. What I'm seeing from people discussing this show is contempt for the more risque and bold elements it utilizes so often. A dismissive attitude is taken towards just about every facet of the shows storytelling, structure, and characters when you can wave the magic \"fanservice\" stick and reject the positives that this story brings. \r\nTo describe this further, I want to go to the root of the issue. Fanservice. What does it mean and how doesit affect the way someone views something. Especially if that someone regards fanservice as wholly negative. Or, I should say, what fanservice has become. \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Fanservice : What It Means and What It Is]\\n\\n\r\nFanservice, as a term, began as a description of a series, show or film, that gained a following of fans that imposed their views onto the creative staff. This could be having opposing views to the stories being developed or something as simple as pushing a relationship between two characters that only they see. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of proceeding with their own vision, the creative teams of these products decided to cater their content towards the fans. Which meant creating plot devices, no matter how contrived, to create these pairs or storylines. At its base, this is exactly what fanservice is. Servicing the fans. Giving them what they want to see. This is a negative term because it often resulted in characters being flanderized. \\n\\n\r\nFlanderization is a term that strictly exists in the media landscape. The general definition is a character losing their humanity and becoming nothing but a collection of their most popular traits. For example, if there's a great child character that also happens to be excessively adorable and the fans love the kind of cute shit this character does. If the creative team decides that they want to make this show strictly about fanservice, they'd slowly forget about every other character trait just to force scenes of that character being cute. Therefore flanderizing the character and making them more hollow as a result. \\n\\n\r\nFanservice, as a term, grew from there. It evolved to talk about fans of a medium in general. Like anime? Well you have a specific set of things you may like that are generally included in just about every anime there is. For example, this could be the fact that as a whole, a vast majority of hardcore anime fans love seeing cute girls with big tits act clumsy and stupid. So now every show past a certain demographic has a cute, clumsy girl with big sweater puppies. That's servicing the fans by creating content that the creators think they'll like without the fanbase for that specific piece of work existing yet. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how a list of certain tropes and archetypes began flooding into anime. Seemingly overnight an influx of certain character types penetrated the industry. These archetypes slowly became tropes which slowly became boring, unoriginal cliches. \\n\\n\r\nThe last evolution of the term laid with online communities. It simply began meaning having tits in your show. Or ass in your show. Or some kind of romanticization of any of that. Sexy characters doing cute or sexy things. This is where I have to disagree. If a show starts with concrete themes and original ideas that happen to involve sexuality or sex in some way, is that servicing fans? Or is that simply creating a story. If it doesn't impact the overall shows quality, in fact, in many casing, adding to the entire concept, should it be dismissed? \\n\\n\r\nThe answer is no. Throughout my journey through Prison School, there were gross, sleazy shots of these perverse characters. yet none of them felt pandering or exhausting or even sexy. None of it felt like it was there to sell to a lowest common denominator. So either i'm completely missing something, which I find hard to believe since i'm generally incredibly critical of \"fanservice\". Or, more logically, the show is simply following a structure. That structure involves batshit insane sexuality, fetishism, and violence. None of it felt pandering. Why? Because it was all played for the theme. More importantly, it was all made to make you laugh. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Narrative Jail]\\n\\n\r\nWe follow five characters as they try and survive a prison that is hilariously located within a school environment. Being sentenced to jail for doing what boys do, peeping, they try to balance relationships, labor, and escaping. If it sounds ridiculous then it's doing the trick. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is solidly insane. The idea is so crazy and hard to believe, it's almost crazier to think that I found myself fully buying into it by episode two. An idea can only be stupid if it's execution is stupid. If the idea is far-fetched then the writer needs to work extra hard to sell that idea. Whether it's through comedy, drama, or flat out surrealism. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of this shows premise and comedy that gets drawn out of it comes from the way the story is treated. Instead of having characters constantly break the meta by pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation, they instead double-down on the seriousness. That seriousness transforms into believe-ability as you get just as swept away as the characters do. By treating the situation seriously, the narrative not only sets proper stakes, but also creates a great anti-dichotomy. Both drawing comparisons to how school and prison relate and how they differ. \\n\\n\r\nBut the show doesn't waste time making these kinds of parallels. This is because Prison School doesn't waste any time. Period. The first four episodes fly by because their pacing is so incredibly fast. If a joke doesn't land, then the one that comes two seconds after may. Its ability to build on a scene and progressively make the situations more and more ridiculous causes this potentially exhausting scenario all the more hilarious and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me as surprising was the amount of tension this show can build. What was even more surprising was the amount of tension it can build while still being funny as fuck. The pacing services the comedy, the three separate arcs of the show service the tension. When a scene is intense it's smartly played as fully serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor comes from the situation, rather than the characters pointing out how stupid the situation is. Which I was so grateful for, since too many shows rest on pointing at something and laughing, rather than explaining the comedy as the scene unravels. By having the characters deal with these stakes that are built up seriously, this show kicks two crows with one stone by creating genuinely intense scenarios with laugh-out-loud results. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAll my praise goes towards the way the first four episodes were dealt with. They were near-flawless executions of character building, comedic timing, and rising stakes with equally rising absurdity as a result. While the show slows down afterwards, I wouldn't necessarily say that was a bad thing. It begins telling the story of all the characters, rather than two of them. Giving each one a reason to be there and add to the story being told.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School smartly drops hints and ideas throughout it's build-up and has each one of these ideas create an entertaining and thoroughly well-done climax. I'd say that this show is a regular anime mystery and thriller but in an absurdist scenario, but I'd be wrong. This is wholly better than any Anime thriller. In fact, this show does better storytelling regardless of the scenario it's in. \\n\\n\r\nThat's both thanks to tight narrative structure as well as the characters. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Prisoners and Their Masters]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are great. Each one has a role to play and each one builds enough of a character never be fully likeable or hateable. Even the seemingly one-dimensional captors get enough time to actually become believable characters within this absolutely insane universe. The secondaries being included in this show are more there for their quirks, however, even they gain some hilarious and interesting things to do as the series progresses. The Chairman in particular is both hilarious and outstanding as the looming hand of god that peers over the school. \\n\\n\r\nAll five prisoners have their own interesting traits. Even the more hate-able a character becomes they manage to fight their way back into your heart with the writers ability to create scenarios that are heartfelt but also hilarious at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe three captors of these prisoners could have very well served as fetishistic dominatrix porn and nothing else. Yet they are constantly played as both threats, but given enough character to also be interesting in their own scenes as well. Each one, as I've said, has a role to play. I never felt as though I should be turned on by anything in this show, which is a huge plus to the creative team. While I may not personally be into the whole cartoon thing, I can easily recognize when an anime is trying to be erotic and sexy, and when an anime is trying to play something for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is undoubtedly exploitative in the way it portrays its characters. However, the amount of which it exploits is where the humor lies. Specifically in the inconceivably ludicrous Vice-President character who carries around a riding crop wearing a short skirt and tits that seem to have a gravity of their own. She's subject to probably the most sexuality throughout the series, yet none of if felt lame or pointless. We get these hilarious sleazy shots that are never really questioned in-universe. Her entire character may feel one note, yet they develop that note until it's playing a tune. \\n\\n\r\nAs the Prison School progresses and it's journey winds down, so do its characters. Each one feels as though they've been pushed to the brink and only one side may win. In this universe, the idea of Men vs. Women could've been incredibly annoying to me, as i'm consistently annoyed at anime for making it's female characters useless, unrealistic, exploitative, doting, etc. Yet it comes as one of the biggest surprises that I had none of these feelings during the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhile something like No Game No Life infuriated me with it's blatant figurine-bait characters with absolutely no depth other than the pockets that the producers were lining... Prison School on the other hand goes the extra mile by creating this competition, Girls vs. Boys, in a way where both sides felt equally capable of defeat. \\n\\n\r\nFor once, I feel, the females in an anime that was, for the most part, meant for men were given an intimidating role that wasn't ever really stripped from them in favor of self-insert bullshit. These girls were awesome. They were memorable. They were exactly what I wanted from villains and it never felt as though they were there to sell. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wish that towards the ending that every character had a role to play in the finale, it felt as though there was one big story being told that never really involved the lesser developed characters. Unfortunately, this caused a feeling of shoehorning certain characters to wrap up a story, rather than actually creating something that can be seen as a \"perfect\" wrap-up. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending leaves a lot of room for the future of the show, however, it still provides a decent closer in terms of character development and status. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Art of a Cell Block]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly great. J.C Staff really put a lot of effort in translating the visuals from the Manga to the series. In fact, i'm thoroughly impressed with the fact that so many of these characters were drawn with so much detail and effort. The shows style overall suited this oddly gritty environment and it helped sell the entire concept better.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in this show is pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. It keeps a mostly realistic style. However, some of the characters are also hilarious unrealistic in terms of design. Both Andre, a fat tiny-faced student, and Meiko, the student council vice-president are incredibly unrealistic in terms of design. They do mesh well with the other characters too, especially since they are the two most fetishistic and fetishized characters. \\n\\n\r\nSince a lot of the humor did come from the situation, more specifically, character dealing with a certain situation, J.C staff being able to perfectly translate the hilarious and over-the-top expressions and emotions every character was going through was just brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nIt felt like what KonoSuba could've been when it comes to creating punchlines through reactions, rather than a flat-out joke being told.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Music]\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was pretty awful. The ED was pretty bad. That being said, the actual music within the show was flat-out great! A lot of it was thematic, intense, and memorable. I really enjoyed the use of dramatic sound effects to either sell a joke, or a sell a scene as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nOn occasion some of the sounds did become a little repetitive, however, it didn't get to the point where it detracted from the scene as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Directing]\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't expect to be talking about direction with this show. Directing in comedy anime has often been fairly weak in terms of creativity. They set up a scene, they deliver it, and the reaction-based comedy does all the work. Two shows stand out from that crowd. Nichijou, and now Prison School. Very different shows, yet equally bursting with creative direction. \\n\\n\r\nTsutomu Mizushima does an outstanding job. I never knew you could be so creative with simple blocking shot utilizing some thicc-as-fuck thighs. There are some genuinely fun PoV shots and some really smart editing. I got some really impressive Edgar Wright vibes from the way some of the scenes were put together. \\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, certain match-cuts elevated scenes from simply funny to flat-out hilarious. I can't emphasize how much editing and directing in general plays a role in how many jokes in a series land. I can't think of a single time when a joke in this show fell flat due to an issue in editing or directing, which is some major praise. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Where the Enjoyment Is Derived]\\n\\n\r\nThis show was outstandingly enjoyable. Although peppered with certain flaws it was, as a whole, a very fun experience. One I'd recommend experiencing with like-minded friends rather than alone. The ability to hear the tension build as you journey with these characters is amplified by hearing your friends experience the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nPrison School isn't there to be sold as a marketing tool. In fact, i'd say a lot of it is crazy and off-the-wall enough to straight up turn off viewers. However, that's all the more appealing to me. I love the \"no-fucks given\" attitude that this show takes. The creative freedom the mangaka had when creating this is so well expressed by the animation studio.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying, but this show is infinitely better being viewed as it was meant to be viewed. Uncensored. I can't imagine how awful some of the punchlines and extended scenes of gratuitous violence or fetishism may have been if half the shot was black. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is something to be cherished. I feel like I could've easily dismissed it as a fetishistic potential-harem. One-dimensional characters with a limp story that was there only to provide eye-candy. Since I'm not one to really enjoy something meant to just serve the fans, I was incredibly hesitant with watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, its ability to convey genuine tension with more genuine laughter hooked me immediately. It wears its motivations on its sleeve, but these motivations aren't nearly as sleazy as this shows  scenarios. The motivation is to make you laugh your ass off. I'd be hard pressed to say that this show didn't do that perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe director worked wonders with what he was given and created funny situations significantly more funny with incredibly clever editing and great shot composition throughout. It makes me furious that so many series out there lack this kind of understanding of comedic timing and editing. However, it makes me even more grateful that I was able to watch something that honestly impressed me from a creative directorial standpoint as well as a comedic and storytelling one. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not lacking flaws, as our protagonists love interests aren't nearly as engaging as any other character and the finale could've involved more of the shows characters. The solid audio, standout art, surprisingly deft storytelling, and endlessly memorable and bad-ass characters deserve all the praise I can give this show. \\n\\n\r\nPrison School is infinitely enjoyable if you are a fan of over-the-top scenarios and equally over-the-top characters in a hilariously inappropriate world. Don't simply dismiss this show as fanservice. Don't simply expect something lame and tedious. Take the extra step and look into that peephole and maybe you can see what this show is truly keeping locked up.",

            "content": "First, I'd like to mention that I'm only writing this review because I lost a bet to someone during an unfaithful night when Echo Fox lost to G2 in the group stages of League of Legends Rift Rivals. I'd also like for it to be known that Dardoch should be hung, torched, and fired. \r\nPrologue-?\r\nLet me start off by saying that this anime was the tits. I don't mean them saggy granny sacks that your girl probably houses. I'm talking about them big ol Hindenburgs that you only see in an Eastern European basement strip club. When I was watching this show, I couldn't containmyself from how funny it was. At every corner, I was thrown with a dramatic plot twist driven off some pretty ridiculous joke. At some point, I was laughing so hard it sounded like I was dying of a heart failure after snorting too much coke off some girl's double D's. Let it be known that I don't even do that kind of shit, but that's just how hard those titties rolled. \\n\\n\r\nStory-9\\n\r\nThe MAL police said no spoilers, so Im cucked, because this makes it really hard for me to fill in words for this review. But the story was pretty great. Real quality content. It's got good pacing with solid twists to keep your ass glued to that dildo sticking off on top of your seat. Then out of no where it smacks you in the face with a soggy homerun meatstick that'll makes you make you drop harder than Dre drops beats. I for one thought the story was a 10/10 but I'm giving it a 9/10 because my butt hole still itched at the end. Also because I don't like to wait for a season 2 but that's a whole another ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nArt was a combination of transcendental elements intertwined with neo-contemporary vibes. By utilizing thick brush strokes and a color pallete of unsatu..I really don't fucking know. The art was good. Character expressions and whatnot  stood out and dramatized everything, which I thought they executed well. And yeah they did a pretty good job drawing out the fan service hentai we all know and love.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nSound was great too. It complimented the anime well and that's as much as I can say. But it was no Beethovan or anything that made you go \"WOWZERS IM LITERARALLY BONKERS and AND EARGASM RIGHT NOW.\" But it was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nThe characters seemed well balanced. Again, no spoilers so yeah, all I can really say is that they complimented each other well and a lot of great moments were had from their similarities and differences. Honestly I gave this anime a 9/10 overall so I don't know why I'm breaking down each quality as though my opinion matters so fuck it HERE WE GO - ENJoyMENt & oVERALL 9 & 9- it was really GREAT ReAlLY GOOD ANIme HOPE you LIKE BEccause I LoVED IT. DEFnitely not foR tHE FAINT HEARted SO DONT WATCH iF U ARE a PUSSY. Go watch Infinite Stratos instead if you are.\\n\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This anime is for mature audiences.\r\nThis anime is currently on episode 12/12(Complete) and that deeply saddens me because this anime uses shock humor at its finest. If there is a weakness to this anime it's the over the top fan service; however, some may find this as a bonus (I don't).\r\nStory: 8/10-\r\nThe story is very entertaining and has good comedic value. There are many scenes I found enjoyable. Give the anime 4-5 episodes before you might drop it because the nonsense will make sense eventually. As redundant as that sounds trust me on this one. The plot is simple, but executed well. Overall Igave this an 8/10 for it's entertainment value and comedic expertise. If the plot were more intricate I could have graded the story higher. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was on par with many current anime's. It can be a little flashy and sexually explicit (more so sexually explicit) than other current anime. That is perfectly fine because the identity calls for it to a degree. I gave the art a 9/10 for its crisp clear visuals and its well formed variety of character expressions. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was competitive with other anime's, but did not standout. After watching the anime you won't remember the sound as much as the scene it was the background for. I think the sound suffered from the visuals and story, as they grabbed the viewers attention in a demanding way. For those reasons I gave the sound an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are very fun, light, and enjoyable (Chiyo Chan is adorable!!!). Their development is done considerably well when you take into account the length and purpose of this anime. I gave this a 8/10 for those reasons above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't express how entertaining this anime is. This anime has absurd, but sharp comedic value. (*SPOILER ALERT*) (***DON'T READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE TO SEE SMALL SPOILER***) You have peeing on others, homosexual innuendos, and just shocking off the wall comedy. Watch with your own discretion.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nReview the above reasons to see specific details on why I believe this anime warrants a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful and enjoy the anime!",

            "content": "Prison School took me by surprise. I have never laughed so hard at something so degenerate, stupid, yet undeniably hilarious since GTO. The humor is so amazingly well executed that the stupidest things will drive the plot, which is surprisingly well done. One of the greatest strengths of Prison School is the voice acting, as all the proper screeches and fluctuations come in fitting times to make the experience worthwhile. There isn't much significant character development, a deep plot, or any of that, but rather this anime utilizes all the ideas we find ridiculous and mashes it together, backing the viewers out into a cornerwhere they have no choice but to laugh. The directing is great, as the animation is by the same studio that responsible for \"Shokugeki no Souma\". The camera angles are utilized to its fullest to provide the ultimate ecchi-comedic effect. Great anime to watch in groups, if you find a few friends who can see the humor in degeneracy. Very impressive overall, but if you don't find the first episode amusing, then don't bother with the rest. If you do, you're in for a ride, as each episode tops its previous shenanigans.",

            "content": "AS AN ANIME\r\nPrison School was without a doubt a surprise for a lot of viewers, even if I'm sure some of you fans of the manga were waiting for it (that was not my case).\r\nProduced by J.C. Staff,  a studio well-known for adapting mediocre light novels and for their bad deeds against reputed visual novels, their relatively poor artistic sense in comparison with competiting studios, and their more or less tight budget (generally more than less), Prison School's adaptation was kind of disappointing even before we could watch it. I myself didn't plan to see more than the first episode, and talking with someblinded fans of the manga beforehand didn't encourage me to review my position (don't ask me why, it's not even anticonformism but more something like disgust regarding their circlejerk for which I was insensible).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the first trailer came out and, stunned by the care given to the visuals, I was very decided to watch at least the beginning. Anyway, let's talk about the anime in itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who discovered Prison School for the first time (like me), some might have been a bit perplexed at the beginning, but quickly, without even liking that much this exagerated, distasteful ecchi side, everyone seemed to go along with the entertaining plot. To the point it became hard to wait for next week's episode, the suspense being definitely present, and sometimes unbearable. If what I'm saying is giving you hope to find again a good thriller series like Death Note, it's not a coincidence, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga plays a lot with parody. It parodies ecchi (some think so at least) by using it in a shameless and absolutely commercial manner, until it becomes, like I already said earlier, distasteful and taxing. But the adaptation goes further, until even mimicking the sonorities of Hollywood blockbuster movies' soundtracks, which award it, as an anime, a certain singularity, a really dramatic or even epic side. It also parodies thrillers like Death Note, or maybe even Prison Break (which I didn't see, so I'm only imagining), and from this absurd blend of absurd, erotism, pinch situations and friendship in a prison-school environment (?!) is born a funny mess in where each situation \u2014 and that is less true for their solution which seemed very well-thought and logical \u2014 seems to come from another world so much improbable they are.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is excellent in the end is definitely how the main characters succeeds to find their way out of the worst dead-ends, in a manner much more composed and believable than all the unbelievable shit that fall upon them. And it is, in a way, exhilarating, like a good Death Note, even if more original.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I couldn't wait for the end of the broadcasting so I started reading the manga after episode 4. Which made me realize some flaws inherent to the anime, which may not be noticeable or bugging when you only experienced this one. I don't really consider them like cons, or maybe yes I do, but I think it could have been way more awesome if this part would have had a better treatment.\\n\\n\r\nAS AN ADAPTATION\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the pacing. A flaw that I seem to often notice in recent anime adaptations like Parasyte, Seven Deadly Sins, Magi or even Hunter x Hunter 2011, and which seems be something like a new  trend or a commercial approach allowing to adapt more, while keeping a low number of episode which avoid fillers and also permit a constantly good animation quality all the way to the end without costing buckets (and all this by satsifying the general public, traumatized by Naruto fillers and One Piece's catastrophic recent episodes). I complain so much about those pacing issues these times that I feel obligated to talk about it, for once I make a review. Maybe I'll convince you, reader, and you'll finally understand why filler is, in itself, not a bad thing, and can be an intelligent way to give additional value to the adaptation, while saving money and time (for the long-running franchises at least).\\n\\n\r\nIt's when I read Prison School's manga that the parodying side of Death Note came to my eyes : the dark tones from some scenes, the camera angles and the internal monologues in pinch situations, the keikakus (it means plan). And it's very well done in the manga. And Death Note anime is very impressive too, because it adapts perfectly this psychological tension, while being very dynamic (it could have been slower and more boring like Monster \u2014 I like Monster), and the pacing doesn't feel too much rushed, the thought processes are well rendered and believably timed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the loss which come from the very fast pacing in the anime is unfortunately the intensity of the best psychological scenes (those with Hana, mainly), it goes fast, too fast, I personally found it difficult to feel worried about Kiyoshi's recurrent incredible and desperate situations. I'm not an expert, nor a scriptwriter, but I think that some added lines of introspective monologue, or silent stills to show the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, even filler,  would have helped to add a bit of hesitating emotions, and even some intensity, to those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, to put it simply, the anime's director gave us an external point of view of the scene, the one of a spectator, when the manga gave me a more \"in Kiyoshi\" feeling, which felt much more tense and desperate and made me worry about the next actions, \"what should he do, he's risking his social life right now, poor Kiyoshi\".\\n\\n\r\nThe \"external viewer\" point of view that the director put in place isn't in my opinion very appropriate because the jokes aren't so well-thought in themselves (it's just the level of absurdity that is amazing), so seen  from outside it just looks like some retarded chain of quickly happening dumb actions commited by the characters, when from an internal point of view, more introspective, everything at stake seem much more important and heavy. It's too bad, in my sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe other flaw in this anime is also, in my opinion, directly due to the fast-pacing. And it's much more to the core of the anime, so it's plain wrong. The problem when you go so fast, it's that the gags don't have the time to take properly effect. A big part of the comedy in this anime is absurd, but really some \"what the fuck did I just watch?!\" kind of absurd. The thing is, as a manga, Prison School give the reader one or two gag per chapter, so you can digest them with a laugh before reading the next chapter. But in the anime, and I have to precise beforehand that it adapted more or less 80 chapters in 12 episodes (didn't count exactly), the events and unbelievably ridiculous actions come one after another in pack of ten, the viewer don't have any time to integrate the joke, so it could have sink in.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a secret that for some jokes, the timing is very important. In Prison School, the joke that is supposed to make you laugh after 5 seconds, not because your brain is slow and that one is very subtle, but more because you really need 5 good seconds the realize the immensity of the ridiculousness of what just happened before your eyes, this awesome stupidity is sweeped away by the next one that comes only 3 seconds after and for which you will do your best to understand to follow the story, to finally sacrifice the comic potential of the situation. And I also think that's too bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the anime place itself in the grandstand, rather than wanting to be involved to understand what happens in the field, with the players, it's a shame but it is nevertheless a very good anime, granted with a good soundtrack and a stunning visual work, there's a lot of things that happens in the plot that will keep you from getting bored even if some joke, while staying always astounding, are less impacting than they could have been. And maybe you will succeed better than me at involving yourself in the characters through the anime, a thing I couldn't do with the pacing imposed on me by J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those who loved the first season, you have to know that it is only the beginning and the sequel will be even better, the psycho-erotic frenzy really takes off at episodes 11-12, and a lot of the following event are equal or worth more than those, some reminding me a lot the deviant but intimate  perversion of manga like Nozoki Ana.",

            "content": "What a goddamn stupid-ass, asinine show.\r\nIt almost feels like one of those series that I'd be ashamed to have admitted enjoying, but there's something that  turns it into an ecchi comedy romp of a very impressive caliber. \r\nWhat elevates it above the others in its class (and the term \"class\" here is used very, very loosely) is its utter sincerity in its absurdity. It takes itself as seriously as possible with its pace and its *god-tier* sound and art direction which brings about an incredible sense of urgency for what is an incredibly dumb story premise. By taking itself seriously and going so farin it comes out the other side, it invites us to laugh at it and telegraphs to us that it knows how stupid it is. Bold, striking art and a hilariously complex orchestral score underline some of the best story moments and dramatic tension, using them as a vehicle for comedy simply by manipulating the tone of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis sort of expert manipulation applies *most* of the time. Meiko's scenes are shamelessly exploitative and her design is absurd, and I'm not a huge fan of her character, especially given how down-to-earth almost every other character's design is (although she shines as a caricature whenever she's partnered with Andre for a comedic scene). \\n\r\nHer use in the plot is mostly justified and it's great for a laugh when her sex appeal is actually used to drive the plot somehow, but her scenes are the closest to that feeling of actual sincerity to its fanservice and I honestly don't care for that a whole lot. Characters like her and several others pale in comparison to seeing characters like Hana, ones with developing internal conflicts and real struggles (albeit hilarious ones).\\n\r\nAs \"real\" as they can get within the boundaries of the high school comedy genre, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, this is a lot more words than is really deserved for a show this stupid. But it is unflinching in its stupidity and dares to go beyond. It's something to be both respected and laughed at.",

            "content": "I came across Prison School after checking the top seasonal anime. At first glance I believed it to be nothing of interest, as I am not a fan of ecchi anime. However, after watching the first few episodes I came to understand why it was among the higher ranks of its season.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIf I had one word to describe the story of Prison School, I would call it absurd. The simple story that boys can get locked into a school prison is completely nonsensical. However, upon closer evaluation, where does something like this even show up? It is so ridiculous that it can be describedas uncommon. Therefore, it avoids the the usual tag that people like to throw onto shows. Generic. If the story is not good, it will at least be interesting.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is a eight. I usually don't bicker too much about art as long as the animation does its job. However the one downside about the graphics of the show is the abundance of censorship. While I do believe that it is probably needed, it can get a little awkward at times and for some, it is even annoying to an extent.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music for the anime is a eight. I usually have the same rule for sound as I do art. However, in this case, the sound not only functions within the anime, but it adds a little. \\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines the most. The five boys that enter the prison are already very interesting characters. However, the one thing that makes characters good is change. In prison school change becomes something very apparent. As the five boys continually face challenges, they change a lot throughout the series. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAre you serious? This is most definitely a ten. The anime shines the most with its sense of humor. The absurdity of the anime, the strange characters, even the music and art contribute to the overall humor of the anime. If anything, this aspect of the show will always make you want to watch the next episode!\\n\r\nOverall: B\\n\r\nWell the mean of my evaluations round up to 8.6. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons that I feel that the show is a B and not higher. This has a lot to do with the discrepancy of character development. While three of the five boys were given a deep character, two of them didn't really get highlighted. Also the fact that the censorship was everywhere did make the show a little bit worse in presentation.",

            "content": "Prison School is the love child of a raunchy teen movie and a grisly \u201970s exploitation flick that successfully balances comedy, sex, and violence. Viewers are never left fatigued from any single element of the show because it knows how and when to give and how and when to pull back. This mastery is what takes the ingredients of what would otherwise be an unremarkable ecchi show and transforms them into something quite exceptional.\r\nMake no mistake about it: Prison School is, at its core, a comedy. Jokes are mostly of the dick-and-fart variety, but rather than hang its hat on lazy, throwaway one-liners, the showinstead carefully takes its time in constructing and delivering jokes. Setups are thoughtfully prepared and allowed to marinate, and then when the right opportunity presents itself, punchlines come out in full force and in unexpected ways, which is why even the crudest, most lowbrow material can make viewers hold their sides with laughter. Furthermore, because the show makes an effort to seamlessly integrate jokes and gags into its plot, the aftermath of the delivery is far more rewarding than it would be from a standalone joke, as can often be seen in scenarios involving callbacks. \\n\\n\r\nThe stylized sexuality found in Prison School is a rare example of fan service complementing a show\u2019s story. Generally, fan service runs the risk of detracting from an otherwise enjoyable show; at best, it adds nothing of substance, and at worst, it is a bothersome distraction. However, as it is in the cases of many teen sex comedies, fan service actually enhances the story here because it is one told from the perspective of horny teenage boys, who from the outset crave the attention\u2014any attention\u2014of the opposite sex. We, the viewers, are able to understand the Prison School world through their eyes, where peeping toms are the heroes and the ones who seek to punish them are the villains. Thus, things like ever-jiggling breasts and all-too-convenient upskirt shots never seem inappropriate or extraneous and are brilliantly effective in properly conveying the amusing hormonal plight of the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nStill, because of such prevalent vulgar humor and hypersexualization, the show seems as though it is constantly in danger of being monopolized by bawdy jokes and T&A at the expense of everything else it has to offer. Fortunately, timely bouts of exaggerated violence, a core component of the exploitation films Prison School shares so much in common with, remind both the viewers as well as the protagonists of their grim reality. Even though the context of the violence is frequently comedic, the sheer brutality of it nonetheless illustrates that their prison life is not all sexy fun and games. The bloodshed and cruelty, coupled with increasing stakes as the story unfolds, gives much-needed weight to their desperate mission to leave the prison and be reinstated as students.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School makes no apologies for what it is, nor should it have to. From the beginning, the viewer is told of all the smut and obscenities to come, and the show never wavers in delivering. It is not the first show to prominently feature some combination of comedy, sex, and violence, but it stands out because it succeeds in its execution of all three, skillfully juggling them and never allowing any single one to completely dominate the entire show.",

But when a friend sorta forced me to eat it with him, I ended up really, really, REALLY enjoying it. It definitely was grotesque and disgusting looking, I normally don't like my pizza with anchovies. But aside from all that the flavours it also gave was just so overpowering and meaningful. I found myself bewildered at howmuch it managed to change my mind. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to hate this pizza, I wanted to find every excuse to drop it. But I gave it a chance and each bite kept proving me wrong and it ended up being one of the funnest and tastiest pizza I've ever had.

I have never watched ecchi before and when I saw the first episode, I was floored by how gross and explicit it was at times. So I dropped it for a while, and then got convinced by my friend to keep on watching when the anime already had 10 episodes. I consumed all of them in one day and I loved it. \r\nI have no excuse. This anime is vile, it is disgusting and it is also hilarious. The art is fantastic, very well drawn, the music fits the show incredibly well,the voice actors do all sorts of ridiculous things and it's just... the ultimate guilty pleasure, I should think. The fact that they got such bigshot seiyuus to voice this speaks for itself, I should think. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're not too squeamish (there's lots of cleavage, butt humor and also public defecation \u2013 not explicit but it's still there \u2013 then go for it. This anime will definitely be remembered. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, though, I still have no idea why I like it, I just do, and so do many other people. I was very interested in seeing the ending, and if there is a season two, I will definitely watch it (much to the horror of my more PG-13 friends).",

            "content": "The original Prison School is probably the most impressive ecchi manga I have ever read. By impressive I don't just mean that it's enjoyable, but rather that it accomplished something that I sincerely didn't believe was possible. It manages to tell a story with hilarious comedy and incredibly lewd ecchi scenes, but at the same time also have a legitimately suspenseful and interesting plotline, *without* making those aspects feel incompatible. I don't think I have ever seen such a smooth and natural way of merging serious and non-serious elements anywhere else where it actually succeeds on both fronts.\r\nNow the anime covers the entirety of thefirst arc of the manga, which tells the story of five boys who enroll in a previously all-girls boarding school which has just become co-ed. However, many of the female students are still disgusted at the notion of having men as their fellow classmates, and a certain vigilante organization within the school called the Underground Student Council decide to take the matter into their own hands. The group consists of the manipulative president Mari, the voluptuous and sadistic vice president Meiko, and the rather violent crazy person Hana who's also got a quite peculiar fetish to say the least. They set a trap for the boys where they manage to frame them for peeping, and consequently send them all off to live inside a small prison located on the school courtyard. And thus, their new life of hell begins as they are forced into manual labor under Meiko's relentless whipping, and they constantly have to be on their guard against the USC's foul play and attempts at getting the boys expelled for good. Meanwhile, the boys try to channel their inner Andy Dufresne as they start to dream about breaking out of prison...\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that needs to be said about this anime is that it doesn't hold anything back. Like not in the slightest. Among other things it features hardcore masochism, a principal obsessed with asses, misunderstandings about two of the guys supposedly being gay for each other, cross dressing, golden showers, a guy shitting himself in class, a girl who sweats about 50 liters per day, a myriad of sexual innuendos, non-stop femdom, epic speeches about the stupidest things imaginable and god knows what else. There are no breaks on this pain train and you better be prepared for what you're getting yourself into when deciding to watch Prison School, because it is rather... crude, to say the least. But crude or not, the execution is stellar, and it rarely fails to make you laugh with how blunt it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all highly exaggerated in their behavior, but given the crazy atmosphere of the show it fits perfectly. Our main character Kiyoshi is energetic and dedicated, Gakuto is the best bro ever, Andre is a huge masochist, Joe is infatuated with ants and Shingo is an American delinquent. And of course they're all perverts, whether they admit it or not, but at least they're perverts with class... well discounting Andre that is. Speaking of which, the ecchi elements in Prison School are not to be underestimated. It has scenes you will probably never see anywhere else other than in hentai. But it doesn't come across as needless fanservice at all; rather it either makes it humorous or just plain epic, especially anything starring Kiyoshi and Hana in the same room is a sight for sore eyes. It's something you really need to see for yourself to understand. Of course the TV-airing of Prison School is censored like almost every ecchi anime is these days, but since the sexual content is mostly there for the sake of comedy rather than arousal I don't really find it all that distracting anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as pacing goes though, there are some issues. The anime covers 81 chapters' worth of content in just 12 episodes, which is quite a lot of story in not too much time. As a result, the transitions in-between scenes are oftentimes done extremely quickly, which means that a lot of the jokes don't really have time to sink in properly before the story moves on to the next segment. There's also the fact that many of the characters actually talk *very* fast, which might just be another way of saving time. So in that sense it is a pretty rushed adaptation, but I think it gets gradually better the longer it goes on, and honestly even despite the fast pacing it still works out fairly smoothly most of the time. A few episodes more would have done wonders though.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga is notorious for its unusually detailed and realistic-looking art style for an ecchi series, and the anime follows the same idea. I don't think it looks quite as crisp as the original art does, but it still gets the job done and gives you a pretty fresh outlook on the genre. The voice acting is also very on-point. Kamiya Hiroshi's performance fits Kiyoshi's character like a glove, probably because he shares a lot of traits with Araragi Koyomi from the Monogatari Series whom Hiroshi has also voiced. Seeing Hanazawa Kana of all people do the role of Hana might be a bit more unexpected though given her absolutely crazy persona, but she actually does an absolutely phenomenal job at it. I also have to give Konishi Katsuyuki a shout-out for his voicing of Gakuto's character; it was truly a special experience to listen to and a very impressive performance overall.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is an anime with a very unorthodox combination of genres and styles, and an even rarer case of one which actually does it successfully. It stands out for its hilariously exaggerated scenes, its crazy characters and its ability to do literally *anything* without holding back for even a second. Is it a show for everyone? No, but I still think it's targeting a much larger audience than first impressions may lead you to believe. It's a highly entertaining series from start to finish, and while I still prefer the manga version, it's definitely an anime worth checking out, even if only to see just what the hell is actually going on in it.",

Because I\u2019m honestly still trying to wrap my head around the concept and the hundreds of planning paper I bought at Office Depot isn\u2019t helping. In some weird universe where parental absence is even more out-of-place than normal by anime standards, there is a private girls\u2019 academy called Hachimitsu (not gonna dignify that name with a response) that has recently started to admit boys for no particular reason like some gender-reversed version of Zoey 101. However, Hachimitsu is an academy that\u2019s far from being suitable for the Nick-audience viewing.\r\nIt\u2019s a harsh place wherethe most minor of infractions will cause you to get treated like a literal prisoner complete with wearing the stereotypical white and black outfits or face expulsion, which is something the five boys who transferred to the academy learn the hard way after making the stupid mistake of trying to peek into the girls\u2019 locker room. Although why they\u2019d want to is beyond me, considering every single girl in this show is less sexually appealing than Bayonetta in clown make-up. In fact, come to think of it, what exactly happens to these boys after they get expelled, considering they don\u2019t exactly seem to be learning anything as is? Well, it turns out they want to stay so they can see a girls\u2019 wet T-shirt contest that\u2019s supposed to occur sometime in the future. Something I find very hard to believe actually exists in this academy - which is quite a feat considering everything else that goes past the headmaster\u2019s eyes.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is an incredibly difficult show to summarize because it seems like it was based on somebody\u2019s Madlibs and the guy who filled it out was off his meds that day. I get that it\u2019s supposed to be combining prison exploitation films with the standard \u201canime harem/school\u201d tropes, but some things just don\u2019t combine, like the Hercules legend and Michael Bolton. Every single element of the series is so contradictory to another element that I have a hard time trying to find out what I\u2019m supposed to be caring about and more importantly, what I\u2019m supposed to laugh at. So the vice-president punishing the boys for being perverted shows ample amounts of cleavage in school? These girls hate the male form and yet they\u2019re open with showing their vaginas to them and the audience at every opportunity? There\u2019s a guy who really loves ants to the point that he\u2019d die for them? There is a gun in my drawer with a special mechanism that only fires the trigger if I\u2019m pointing it up my nose?\\n\\n\r\nOh sorry. My head was getting overwhelmed and I was thinking for a fast way to clear some thoughts. This whole show plays out like a South Park episode that was stretched to twelve times the length and stripped of all the life, memorable characters, great movie parodies, and subversive topical humor that still played by the rules even when it showcased a magician entertaining kids by sawing his penis off and hiding it behind a kid\u2019s ear, causing it to fall into the same lifeless monkey cheese the shows it tries to parody fall into. Get past the presentation and all Prison School is is another goddamn story about the opposite sex trying to fit into a same-sex school and discovering what qualifies as romance in this medium whilst being about character types rather than characters. And unless you\u2019re one of those people who really like over-the-top art styles, you\u2019ll get tired of the presentation real fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor relies entirely on overreacting, awkward situations that the characters narrate to the point that the joke overstays its welcome (which is any length of time above zero seconds), or just being nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical. And unusually for a Tsutomu Mizushima anime - and especially compared to JC Staff\u2019s other perverted comedy that aired in the same season - the comedic timing is completely awful, so forget laughing. I know Funimation has never been above being a little liberal with translations, but poking the bear aside, I find it very hard to believe that video games even exist in this universe. And once that thought entered my mind, the shock chuckle I got from seeing that became like the shock chuckle of seeing a piece of wood stuck down someone\u2019s sphincter: incapable of provoking an emotion from me other than confusion.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this show isn\u2019t the least bit as edgy or gritty as it thinks it is. It\u2019s more like a desperate dad trying to make his baby smile by stretching his face out and go \u201cabloogeewoogeewoo\u201d. And when that\u2019s not working, he tells the kid about all the fucked-up things he saw in the world like a twelve-year old who doesn\u2019t know any better. Who\u2019s the baby at that point, huh old man?\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this stupid conversation between the male students and their principal in which he\u2019ll allow them to stay a little longer if they can tell him whether or not boobs or asses are better and why that is. The punchline is supposed to be that being perverted gets you rewarded, which I think has only been used in at least ten different gross-out comedies, as well as every Kevin Smith film ever. Most of all, I don\u2019t even care about the semantics regarding which is better. It\u2019s a dumb conversation to have in real life and it\u2019s dumb in fiction.\\n\\n\r\nAnother memorable attempt at the show\u2019s desperation was when the closest thing to a male lead tried to sneak out of the school in order to show up for a date. Let\u2019s be generous for now and say we give two shits for if he actually shows up or not, but the attempts at hiding his break-out are just pathetic because it\u2019s very obvious he won\u2019t get caught until the episode ends at the very least, and the punchline is always that he avoids getting caught due to last-minute circumstance that\u2019s too weird to be funny. I\u2019ll admit to smiling a bit at the defecation radio because that actually seemed possible in reality, but that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the biggest thing that got to me was the finale. First off, it was incredibly obvious who was going to win in the end and the plan to achieve said end was pretty damn simplistic in of itself with virtually no twists to the formula or any attempt to make the characters less boring resulting from it. And yet the show drags the plan out for three episodes just so it can cram in a hundred more overlong \u201coh shit, I saw a woman\u2019s privates\u201d joke whenever it spots an opportunity to do so whilst tying up loose ends that quite frankly missed the mark for payoff ages ago. Yeah, South Park itself has a tendency to overreach, but not to this extent.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, I won\u2019t spoil the final result, but I felt nothing for anybody after everything was wrapped up, and not just because of the rampant yet confusing sexism. Because at the end of the day, nothing\u2019s changed aside from certain circumstances. The characters have achieved nothing, learned nothing, will never be remembered for anything, and have certainly not learned how to be funny to anyone older than twelve. All the suffering they went through? What exactly was the point of it all? Please tell me. I\u2019m dying to know.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard some people who acknowledge this show\u2019s problems by saying it gets by on the tension. As we\u2019ve covered before regarding Detroit Metal City, I find this impossible to feel when the show has an over-the-top style that is ALWAYS on. It NEVER takes a break to have the characters actually act human or feel like they\u2019re in real danger. Imagine if the intrigue in Gurren Lagann was dealt with using the same \u201cwho the hell do you think I am/raw raw fight the powah\u201d atmosphere as mostly everything else in that show. We\u2019d think Imaishi wasn\u2019t taking the audience seriously, or that Baz Luhrmann somehow broke into the industry. When they say style can be substance, they don\u2019t mean keep the style on 24/7. Because even the most powerful religious symbolism gets old if you just hammer in the same verse over and over.\\n\\n\r\nNo likable characters, no funny jokes, not a lick of sense regarding anything that happens, and whatever tension that\u2019s supposed to exist throughout the series is undermined by the fact that I\u2019m watching a bunch of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys rejects constantly trying to perform bad stand-up comedy. Final grade? Utterly forgettable.",

I'm a big fan of Great Teacher Onizuka and it's the first time in years I've had the same kind of enjoyment watching a comedy. I'm usually not a big fan of over-sexualized female characters or harem animes but prison school is an exception.\r\nStory 9/10\r\n5 perverted teenagers end up in a school full of girls. They peak into the girls bath and get grounded into a prison set in the middle of the campus. These 5 guys are hilarious, one is fat as fuck, one is creepy as fuck, one is geeky as fuck... Thegirls in charge of them AKA the Underground School Council, bully them, torture them, insult them. This kind of treatment gives them boners lol\\n\r\nAll the comical elements that build up in the series are pretty similar to what would happen in GTO in these kind of weird sexual moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is flawless. The action scenes are fast paced and you never get bored. Great attention to detail. Nothing bad to say about it. Character design is fine too and there's a lot of panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\neeeeh, not a fan of the opening or ending. For the sake of giving Prison School a 10/10 I'll just give the sound a 10. The voice acting is awesome though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 \\n\r\nAMAZING. The 5 guys are funny as hell, the MC kyoshi is kinda lovable and cute while his friends are just creepy sexual weirdos. Since they're always stuck together they create great bonds and funny homoerotic quiproquos. The girls in charge of the prison are as fucked up as the guys.\\n\r\nAND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SCHOOL DESERVES AN AWARD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nYou will not get bored. I swear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nyep",

            "content": "Prison School is a good anime, although it sometimes fails to play to its strengths and descends into pointlessness. \r\nI don't look to anime for sexual gratification; so when I criticize the censorship, I'm not doing it out of blue-balled resentment. (Well, not just that anyway.) It detracts from the quality of the animation, and it's often just unnaturally forced into the scene, to cover things that don't really need to be covered. They can indirectly depict urolagnian debauchery but they draw the line at panty-shots? Prison School has nice animation, but it's difficult to appreciate this when so much of it is censored. \r\nHonestly,I kind of wish there wasn't quite so much sex-appeal. I want to be able to just watch and laugh without having to make the sign of the cross every three seconds. A lot of it was just for the purpose of humor, but when we got into territory that was more clearly aimed at arousal, it got a bit more uncomfortable. The series could have been better if it stopped trying to tickle my boner and started focusing solely on tickling my funny bone. (I can tickle my own boner, thank you very much.)\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of how Prison School could have been better, the characters were something of a minefield placed over a gold mine. Characters like Hana, Vice President, the Principal guy, Kiyoshi, Joe, and Gakuto were great. But then there's characters like that one guy who had no personality, but got kind of pissy sometimes and that's all we really know about him so how can I really be expected to know his name, and Mari, who I find to be rather flat compared to characters like the Vice President. (Haha. Flat.) And then there's Andre. He is filth. He is the most disgusting character, the most repulsive thing, that I have ever seen in any anime. No, in anything. Every time he was on the screen, I felt tears welling in my eyes and beginning to drip down onto my cheeks as my body shook with dry heave after dry heave after vomiting fit. The creator of this character should be shot. Or just killed. I suppose it doesn't matter how. But he must be brutally murdered (or just murdered, I'm not picky) before he releases another Andre into the world. \\n\\n\r\nBut it's a testament to the strength of the best characters that the presence of Andre does not result in an automatic 1. Instead, the good, borderline non-existent, and terrible characters balance each other out. I just wish we saw some characters more often. (Like Hana. I want more.) \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is absurd; it barely exists, and what is there is ridiculous, but it still maintains somewhat of a sense of internal consistency, and it works. The premise is bizarre, and a lot of the plot developments just make it weirder, but it has a beautiful sense of logic to it that would make Hegel turn green with envy as he realized the insignificance of his boring collections of meaningless compound words. \\n\\n\r\nBut whatever. You should probably forget everything I've said up until now. And I mean everything. Forget everything I've ever said in my life. The most important thing is that Prison School is very funny. It could have been better in a lot of aspects, but it succeeds in entertaining its audience. It's unique and hilarious. You won't find anything else like it, and it's not easy to find anything funnier. If you watch it, you will laugh, unless you suck. It's a comedy; it's comedic. There you go. It's a success.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the gags can get very repetitive, (Despite the changing of details and introduction of some new sexual situation, it's still the same damn joke. And somebody needs to tell the mangaka that a running gag isn't just a copy-and-paste thing; you actually have to be creative to keep it funny.) but they don't quite over-stay their welcome. A lot of the time, when Prison School seemed to get stale, it changed just enough to keep you going for another episode. But, towards the end it really isn't that funny anymore. Not laugh-out-loud funny anyway. Ramping up the vulgarity does not equate to increasing the funniness, and it's sort of a cheap tactic.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of watching this anime, you should probably just read the manga. Think about it. It covers a lot more of the story, it has minimal censorship, and the panel format sometimes lends itself to better comedic timing. (Mostly just the first two.) And what did it really gain in the adaptation? The boring OP and ED? I am unimpressed. But if you absolutely refuse to read manga, then that's fine too. I would still recommend the anime, provided that you know what you're getting into. \\n\\n\r\nA 7 seems about right for Prison School. It is very flawed, but the entertaining parts are entertaining enough for me to call it 'good.' It's certainly better than a lot of other anime out there.",

            "content": "You\u2019re probably thinking what does \u201cprison\u201dand \u201cschool\u201d have to do with each other? Isn\u2019t prison where criminals go to and school is where people get an education? Prison School sort of works differently. When the ratio of girls to guys is around 20:1, then you know your school has something that\u2019s worth more than just education. Of course, I\u2019m referring to the elite boarding school known as Hachimitsu Academy.\r\nBased on the manga of the same name, the series was long sought to get an anime adaptation at some point. And when it did, there were concerns about how it should be adapted. The concerns includesthe amount of censorship or material omitted as a show like this may not be suitable to air on TV. And that\u2019s pretty obvious to tell as well. Prison School is literally like a fan service extravaganza. No less than 30 seconds into the first episode and you\u2019ll realize it why. However, I would also describe Prison School more as a comedy thriller, a show that satirizes fan service itself. Sounds a bit odd right? If you\u2019re interested, keep reading on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story involves 5 boys. They are Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Shingo, and Andre. Kiyoshi is sort of the primary protagonist among them although all of them get spotlight in the story some way or another. Regardless, the school they are attending has over 1000 girls and they are some of the few guys. While this seems like some sort of heavenly dream coming true, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. It turns out, there\u2019s a strong female dominance and authority at the school. This mainly composes of the Underground Student Council made of an elite group of female characters such as Mari, Hana, and Meiko. Their main intention is to get the boys expelled and throughout the show, we see how far they go. To say the least, the Underground Student Council is ridiculously powerful. They seem to have absolute rule over the school and anyone who fails to abide by their authority will pay the consequence. This is where the prison part comes in as people get locked up. For its purpose, the show often portrays the women abusing the boys while the main characters tries to make the most of their time there. Remember what I said about fan service earlier? That part easily comes to play when most of the female characters are sexualized throughout the story. Take Meiko for example. She is one of the Student Council members and often punishes the boys through extreme form of sadism such as whipping, brutalizing, and beating up the boys to get satisfaction. Andre is mostly the victim of her assaults although there\u2019s implications that he secretly enjoys it. While all this seems a bit over-the-top notch, I dare say that its performance is more like a thriller. The comedy is the fan service while the thriller is how much the boys can take the mental and physical abuse. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, most if not all the boys are perverts. Kiyoshi is probably the tamest of them and probably also the most normal character in the show. His crush on Hana, a secretary of the Student Council, often lands him into controversial positions. Despite this, Kiyoshi is an honest guy and stands firm as a character that most others contrast in this series. The other boys also show some delicacy when it comes to their own personalities but none of them come close to him. A good amount of emphasis is also placed on some of their interactions with female characters. While most of them are victims of the characters, there are some that achieve a bit of closure. For instance, we have Shingo\u2019s relationship with Anzu that seems to develop into some genuine love. Kiyoshi\u2019s relationship with Hana also has some bits of innocence although given the nature of the show, it\u2019s mostly satirized by fan service. \\n\\n\r\nAs fan service dedicates the style of Prison School, the plot has less of a focus. The story is actually pretty simple and prison breaking is part of its plot element. It\u2019s exactly as the premise implies and follows it pretty accurately. When it comes to adaptation faithfulness, there\u2019s some obvious content that is omitted while the story itself is rushed. On the other hand, the adaptation does an explicit job with its comedy. I can\u2019t remember how many times I laughed when watching this show. This is set by Prison School\u2019s high standards of crafting ridiculousness. It\u2019s as if the fan service is alive and self-aware. Cameras are deliberately focused to highlight moments when boobs are bounced or when crotch shots are shown in close view. There\u2019s also some comedic symbolism such as with the mushroom or Medusa that really create a sensational satire. So in essence, Prison School knows its intentions and isn\u2019t shy at all from hiding it. If you want to be serviced, this is where it\u2019s at. \\n\\n\r\nBy adaptation standards, the artwork is crude but in a good way. For some reason, Madhouse decided to toughen it up a notch and make the boys look more ripped than their manga counterparts. Similarly, the female characters show all sort of juicy body parts. As the show is saturated by fan service, there\u2019s almost endless amount of it. There\u2019s also both a censored and uncensored version so watch at your own discretion. In the meantime, the series\u2019 school looks normal except with the establishment of the prisons. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack, Prison School\u2019s success comes from the characters. It takes a strong cast to convince the audience of realism of the setting. Thankfully, the cast pulls it off. Character reactions matches in par with the voice in particular during torture scenes. Yes, torture scenes. This is when the boys get their mental and physical abuse from the Underground Student Council. The voices screams both pain and pleasure as it convinces the audience of their complication. On a lesser scale, the OST and theme songs are much more standard although I will say that some of the symbolism portrayed in the OP theme song is cleverly done. The OST also gets some thrilling moments in particularly some of the later episodes as the boys gets more desperate to fight back.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the endgame for a show like this? My advice is to give the first 5 minutes a try. If you can last that long, then you\u2019ll have an easy time watching the series. Be aware that fan service is endless and you may forget at times what the story is actually about. Regardless if you\u2019re an anime-only or manga veteran, Prison School accurately adapts its comedy with the character reactions. Unfortunately, the show is only a 1-cour so do expect content to be omitted. (there\u2019s a \u201cteaser\u201d for a potential second season though) Whether these may be something appealing or a personal favorite will be left in the dust. Despite that, Prison School in the end is a fun show. It\u2019s fun enough to not only portray fan service in an overwhelming way but one that makes you come back for more.\\n",

            "content": "Prison school is in fact a great example of bad show with great elements. Prison School successfully takes suspense, drama, action, and ecchi, turns them into one perfect mess. Prison School is also a great example of a \"Hit or Miss\" anime show. Meaning you either like it or don't like it depending or your personal tastes in anime and experience.  The story is sort of plain however the elements they add like violence, sexy scenes, drama, suspense etc literally makes the a bit non existent. There are many things I like about story though, but for now the thing that stood out themost was the fact that (and stated before) the show overall was so bad it's good. The soundtrack is awesome lots of rock and metal added to make action scenes and \"Uh oh i'm in trouble\" scenes more suspense. The characters, will never, ever be forgettable. Prison school has one of the best cast of unforgettable characters I have seen in a while. Hana (she's first because she was my favourite) Kiyoshi, the vice president, the Chairman of the school, just about everyone is unforgettable. You, the viewer, if Prison school is up you alley and you enjoy bizarre shows this show is indeed for you. Overall I think the show was Really, really good given the elements and story the creator and directors were working with. 8/10",

Any feed back would be appreciated as long as its constructive :D\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nPrison School is all about 5 guys in a school for girls that are caught peeping in the girl's bathroom, and are sent to a prison in the middle of the school. Pretty normal, huh? You've seen nothing yet lmao. I gave the story \"just\" an 8 because  the storyline had some ups and downs, as after episode 7, the whole plot is left a bit unconsistent, but recovering later on.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nWhat makes Prison School sucha good show is the animation. I was extraordinary suprised by how each character's face is done to emphasize how they are feeling in each moment, not to mention the smoothness throughout the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing special to say here. Music was pretty sweet, especially the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nDid I say animation was what made the show good? HAH. Characters in the show are just the most hilarious thing EVER. Normally when seeing the show, I would almost laughh just by seeing their weird ass face. But what really stands out for me is the fact that you are always mind fucked by everything they do, combined with a great sense of humor (plus animation). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say. I've enjoyed every single chapter in the whole show, and not only would I watch the chapter every single week but also be thinking about it for the next days.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Prison School can be defined by one word: awesome. i didn't give it a 10 because of the post-escape storyline, but overall, I would recommend this great anime to almost everyone.",

Honestly this anime is like the South Park characters all grown up and horny, and what makes it even more funnier is how these guys are such relentless virgins, its hilarious. Even if the show was vile and disturbing, it was entertaining to watch during my free time. \r\nI thought of the vice president as an overly sexualized character, but thats what makes it even funnier. The sexual scenes make the anime look like a hentai animehonestly. Overall, I have nothing to say about this anime other than it was one of the most hilarious anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Prison school is a weird one for me. That's mostly due to because I absolutely despise ecchi / harem / blah, blah generic titillating content that's incredibly common in anime. And that might be why I enjoyed the show to a certain extent. It takes the idea of fanservice and stretches to a very specific and fetishized realm that it can end up being hilarious to some people or, at least, intriguing because the absurdity of it.\r\nThat said, besides a couple of moments spread out far and between I wasn't laughing or let alone chuckling as much as I heard I was going to be.Some jokes are repeated or just go for a bit too long which ends up at times being slightly annoying. The story isn't much either; Do me a small favor and read the synopsis of this show. Did it? That's the entire show but stretched to 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSure, some things happen here and there, but it follows a very simple formula. People do things, people get punished for doing those things, the end. Which sure, is fine and dandy as long as the characters are interesting, but besides two out of the three crazy dominatrixes, the entire cast is pretty forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a perverted boy band of main characters; The first being the standard, boring anime dude, second, the nerdy guy, third, the tough guy, fourth, the fat one and last but not least, the wimpy weird one. Like I said, besides two out of the crazy trio the characters are pretty darn boring. \\n\\n\r\nBut I still enjoyed the show, I mean is not great, but is not bad either. Is a good time waster if you have nothing else to do and hey if you want to see an incredibly over-the-top and fetishized version of your standard ecchi wank-off fest, check it out. Worst case scenario is that you wasted your time by reading this review and hated the show thanks to my weird yes and no recommendation for the thing. What do you have to lose!? \\n",

            "content": "[8.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nSo I didn't expect to like Prison School nearly as much as I did. In fact, this may be one of the best anime series I've seen thus far. What I'm seeing from people discussing this show is contempt for the more risque and bold elements it utilizes so often. A dismissive attitude is taken towards just about every facet of the shows storytelling, structure, and characters when you can wave the magic \"fanservice\" stick and reject the positives that this story brings. \r\nTo describe this further, I want to go to the root of the issue. Fanservice. What does it mean and how doesit affect the way someone views something. Especially if that someone regards fanservice as wholly negative. Or, I should say, what fanservice has become. \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Fanservice : What It Means and What It Is]\\n\\n\r\nFanservice, as a term, began as a description of a series, show or film, that gained a following of fans that imposed their views onto the creative staff. This could be having opposing views to the stories being developed or something as simple as pushing a relationship between two characters that only they see. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of proceeding with their own vision, the creative teams of these products decided to cater their content towards the fans. Which meant creating plot devices, no matter how contrived, to create these pairs or storylines. At its base, this is exactly what fanservice is. Servicing the fans. Giving them what they want to see. This is a negative term because it often resulted in characters being flanderized. \\n\\n\r\nFlanderization is a term that strictly exists in the media landscape. The general definition is a character losing their humanity and becoming nothing but a collection of their most popular traits. For example, if there's a great child character that also happens to be excessively adorable and the fans love the kind of cute shit this character does. If the creative team decides that they want to make this show strictly about fanservice, they'd slowly forget about every other character trait just to force scenes of that character being cute. Therefore flanderizing the character and making them more hollow as a result. \\n\\n\r\nFanservice, as a term, grew from there. It evolved to talk about fans of a medium in general. Like anime? Well you have a specific set of things you may like that are generally included in just about every anime there is. For example, this could be the fact that as a whole, a vast majority of hardcore anime fans love seeing cute girls with big tits act clumsy and stupid. So now every show past a certain demographic has a cute, clumsy girl with big sweater puppies. That's servicing the fans by creating content that the creators think they'll like without the fanbase for that specific piece of work existing yet. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how a list of certain tropes and archetypes began flooding into anime. Seemingly overnight an influx of certain character types penetrated the industry. These archetypes slowly became tropes which slowly became boring, unoriginal cliches. \\n\\n\r\nThe last evolution of the term laid with online communities. It simply began meaning having tits in your show. Or ass in your show. Or some kind of romanticization of any of that. Sexy characters doing cute or sexy things. This is where I have to disagree. If a show starts with concrete themes and original ideas that happen to involve sexuality or sex in some way, is that servicing fans? Or is that simply creating a story. If it doesn't impact the overall shows quality, in fact, in many casing, adding to the entire concept, should it be dismissed? \\n\\n\r\nThe answer is no. Throughout my journey through Prison School, there were gross, sleazy shots of these perverse characters. yet none of them felt pandering or exhausting or even sexy. None of it felt like it was there to sell to a lowest common denominator. So either i'm completely missing something, which I find hard to believe since i'm generally incredibly critical of \"fanservice\". Or, more logically, the show is simply following a structure. That structure involves batshit insane sexuality, fetishism, and violence. None of it felt pandering. Why? Because it was all played for the theme. More importantly, it was all made to make you laugh. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Narrative Jail]\\n\\n\r\nWe follow five characters as they try and survive a prison that is hilariously located within a school environment. Being sentenced to jail for doing what boys do, peeping, they try to balance relationships, labor, and escaping. If it sounds ridiculous then it's doing the trick. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is solidly insane. The idea is so crazy and hard to believe, it's almost crazier to think that I found myself fully buying into it by episode two. An idea can only be stupid if it's execution is stupid. If the idea is far-fetched then the writer needs to work extra hard to sell that idea. Whether it's through comedy, drama, or flat out surrealism. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of this shows premise and comedy that gets drawn out of it comes from the way the story is treated. Instead of having characters constantly break the meta by pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation, they instead double-down on the seriousness. That seriousness transforms into believe-ability as you get just as swept away as the characters do. By treating the situation seriously, the narrative not only sets proper stakes, but also creates a great anti-dichotomy. Both drawing comparisons to how school and prison relate and how they differ. \\n\\n\r\nBut the show doesn't waste time making these kinds of parallels. This is because Prison School doesn't waste any time. Period. The first four episodes fly by because their pacing is so incredibly fast. If a joke doesn't land, then the one that comes two seconds after may. Its ability to build on a scene and progressively make the situations more and more ridiculous causes this potentially exhausting scenario all the more hilarious and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nWhat struck me as surprising was the amount of tension this show can build. What was even more surprising was the amount of tension it can build while still being funny as fuck. The pacing services the comedy, the three separate arcs of the show service the tension. When a scene is intense it's smartly played as fully serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor comes from the situation, rather than the characters pointing out how stupid the situation is. Which I was so grateful for, since too many shows rest on pointing at something and laughing, rather than explaining the comedy as the scene unravels. By having the characters deal with these stakes that are built up seriously, this show kicks two crows with one stone by creating genuinely intense scenarios with laugh-out-loud results. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nAll my praise goes towards the way the first four episodes were dealt with. They were near-flawless executions of character building, comedic timing, and rising stakes with equally rising absurdity as a result. While the show slows down afterwards, I wouldn't necessarily say that was a bad thing. It begins telling the story of all the characters, rather than two of them. Giving each one a reason to be there and add to the story being told.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School smartly drops hints and ideas throughout it's build-up and has each one of these ideas create an entertaining and thoroughly well-done climax. I'd say that this show is a regular anime mystery and thriller but in an absurdist scenario, but I'd be wrong. This is wholly better than any Anime thriller. In fact, this show does better storytelling regardless of the scenario it's in. \\n\\n\r\nThat's both thanks to tight narrative structure as well as the characters. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Prisoners and Their Masters]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are great. Each one has a role to play and each one builds enough of a character never be fully likeable or hateable. Even the seemingly one-dimensional captors get enough time to actually become believable characters within this absolutely insane universe. The secondaries being included in this show are more there for their quirks, however, even they gain some hilarious and interesting things to do as the series progresses. The Chairman in particular is both hilarious and outstanding as the looming hand of god that peers over the school. \\n\\n\r\nAll five prisoners have their own interesting traits. Even the more hate-able a character becomes they manage to fight their way back into your heart with the writers ability to create scenarios that are heartfelt but also hilarious at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe three captors of these prisoners could have very well served as fetishistic dominatrix porn and nothing else. Yet they are constantly played as both threats, but given enough character to also be interesting in their own scenes as well. Each one, as I've said, has a role to play. I never felt as though I should be turned on by anything in this show, which is a huge plus to the creative team. While I may not personally be into the whole cartoon thing, I can easily recognize when an anime is trying to be erotic and sexy, and when an anime is trying to play something for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is undoubtedly exploitative in the way it portrays its characters. However, the amount of which it exploits is where the humor lies. Specifically in the inconceivably ludicrous Vice-President character who carries around a riding crop wearing a short skirt and tits that seem to have a gravity of their own. She's subject to probably the most sexuality throughout the series, yet none of if felt lame or pointless. We get these hilarious sleazy shots that are never really questioned in-universe. Her entire character may feel one note, yet they develop that note until it's playing a tune. \\n\\n\r\nAs the Prison School progresses and it's journey winds down, so do its characters. Each one feels as though they've been pushed to the brink and only one side may win. In this universe, the idea of Men vs. Women could've been incredibly annoying to me, as i'm consistently annoyed at anime for making it's female characters useless, unrealistic, exploitative, doting, etc. Yet it comes as one of the biggest surprises that I had none of these feelings during the show. \\n\\n\r\nWhile something like No Game No Life infuriated me with it's blatant figurine-bait characters with absolutely no depth other than the pockets that the producers were lining... Prison School on the other hand goes the extra mile by creating this competition, Girls vs. Boys, in a way where both sides felt equally capable of defeat. \\n\\n\r\nFor once, I feel, the females in an anime that was, for the most part, meant for men were given an intimidating role that wasn't ever really stripped from them in favor of self-insert bullshit. These girls were awesome. They were memorable. They were exactly what I wanted from villains and it never felt as though they were there to sell. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wish that towards the ending that every character had a role to play in the finale, it felt as though there was one big story being told that never really involved the lesser developed characters. Unfortunately, this caused a feeling of shoehorning certain characters to wrap up a story, rather than actually creating something that can be seen as a \"perfect\" wrap-up. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending leaves a lot of room for the future of the show, however, it still provides a decent closer in terms of character development and status. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Art of a Cell Block]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly great. J.C Staff really put a lot of effort in translating the visuals from the Manga to the series. In fact, i'm thoroughly impressed with the fact that so many of these characters were drawn with so much detail and effort. The shows style overall suited this oddly gritty environment and it helped sell the entire concept better.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design in this show is pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. It keeps a mostly realistic style. However, some of the characters are also hilarious unrealistic in terms of design. Both Andre, a fat tiny-faced student, and Meiko, the student council vice-president are incredibly unrealistic in terms of design. They do mesh well with the other characters too, especially since they are the two most fetishistic and fetishized characters. \\n\\n\r\nSince a lot of the humor did come from the situation, more specifically, character dealing with a certain situation, J.C staff being able to perfectly translate the hilarious and over-the-top expressions and emotions every character was going through was just brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nIt felt like what KonoSuba could've been when it comes to creating punchlines through reactions, rather than a flat-out joke being told.\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Music]\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was pretty awful. The ED was pretty bad. That being said, the actual music within the show was flat-out great! A lot of it was thematic, intense, and memorable. I really enjoyed the use of dramatic sound effects to either sell a joke, or a sell a scene as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nOn occasion some of the sounds did become a little repetitive, however, it didn't get to the point where it detracted from the scene as a whole. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Directing]\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't expect to be talking about direction with this show. Directing in comedy anime has often been fairly weak in terms of creativity. They set up a scene, they deliver it, and the reaction-based comedy does all the work. Two shows stand out from that crowd. Nichijou, and now Prison School. Very different shows, yet equally bursting with creative direction. \\n\\n\r\nTsutomu Mizushima does an outstanding job. I never knew you could be so creative with simple blocking shot utilizing some thicc-as-fuck thighs. There are some genuinely fun PoV shots and some really smart editing. I got some really impressive Edgar Wright vibes from the way some of the scenes were put together. \\n\\n\r\nSpecifically, certain match-cuts elevated scenes from simply funny to flat-out hilarious. I can't emphasize how much editing and directing in general plays a role in how many jokes in a series land. I can't think of a single time when a joke in this show fell flat due to an issue in editing or directing, which is some major praise. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Where the Enjoyment Is Derived]\\n\\n\r\nThis show was outstandingly enjoyable. Although peppered with certain flaws it was, as a whole, a very fun experience. One I'd recommend experiencing with like-minded friends rather than alone. The ability to hear the tension build as you journey with these characters is amplified by hearing your friends experience the same thing. \\n\\n\r\nPrison School isn't there to be sold as a marketing tool. In fact, i'd say a lot of it is crazy and off-the-wall enough to straight up turn off viewers. However, that's all the more appealing to me. I love the \"no-fucks given\" attitude that this show takes. The creative freedom the mangaka had when creating this is so well expressed by the animation studio.\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying, but this show is infinitely better being viewed as it was meant to be viewed. Uncensored. I can't imagine how awful some of the punchlines and extended scenes of gratuitous violence or fetishism may have been if half the shot was black. \\n\\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is something to be cherished. I feel like I could've easily dismissed it as a fetishistic potential-harem. One-dimensional characters with a limp story that was there only to provide eye-candy. Since I'm not one to really enjoy something meant to just serve the fans, I was incredibly hesitant with watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, its ability to convey genuine tension with more genuine laughter hooked me immediately. It wears its motivations on its sleeve, but these motivations aren't nearly as sleazy as this shows  scenarios. The motivation is to make you laugh your ass off. I'd be hard pressed to say that this show didn't do that perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe director worked wonders with what he was given and created funny situations significantly more funny with incredibly clever editing and great shot composition throughout. It makes me furious that so many series out there lack this kind of understanding of comedic timing and editing. However, it makes me even more grateful that I was able to watch something that honestly impressed me from a creative directorial standpoint as well as a comedic and storytelling one. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not lacking flaws, as our protagonists love interests aren't nearly as engaging as any other character and the finale could've involved more of the shows characters. The solid audio, standout art, surprisingly deft storytelling, and endlessly memorable and bad-ass characters deserve all the praise I can give this show. \\n\\n\r\nPrison School is infinitely enjoyable if you are a fan of over-the-top scenarios and equally over-the-top characters in a hilariously inappropriate world. Don't simply dismiss this show as fanservice. Don't simply expect something lame and tedious. Take the extra step and look into that peephole and maybe you can see what this show is truly keeping locked up.",

I'd also like for it to be known that Dardoch should be hung, torched, and fired. \r\nPrologue-?\r\nLet me start off by saying that this anime was the tits. I don't mean them saggy granny sacks that your girl probably houses. I'm talking about them big ol Hindenburgs that you only see in an Eastern European basement strip club. When I was watching this show, I couldn't containmyself from how funny it was. At every corner, I was thrown with a dramatic plot twist driven off some pretty ridiculous joke. At some point, I was laughing so hard it sounded like I was dying of a heart failure after snorting too much coke off some girl's double D's. Let it be known that I don't even do that kind of shit, but that's just how hard those titties rolled. \\n\\n\r\nStory-9\\n\r\nThe MAL police said no spoilers, so Im cucked, because this makes it really hard for me to fill in words for this review. But the story was pretty great. Real quality content. It's got good pacing with solid twists to keep your ass glued to that dildo sticking off on top of your seat. Then out of no where it smacks you in the face with a soggy homerun meatstick that'll makes you make you drop harder than Dre drops beats. I for one thought the story was a 10/10 but I'm giving it a 9/10 because my butt hole still itched at the end. Also because I don't like to wait for a season 2 but that's a whole another ordeal.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nArt was a combination of transcendental elements intertwined with neo-contemporary vibes. By utilizing thick brush strokes and a color pallete of unsatu..I really don't fucking know. The art was good. Character expressions and whatnot  stood out and dramatized everything, which I thought they executed well. And yeah they did a pretty good job drawing out the fan service hentai we all know and love.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nSound was great too. It complimented the anime well and that's as much as I can say. But it was no Beethovan or anything that made you go \"WOWZERS IM LITERARALLY BONKERS and AND EARGASM RIGHT NOW.\" But it was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8\\n\r\nThe characters seemed well balanced. Again, no spoilers so yeah, all I can really say is that they complimented each other well and a lot of great moments were had from their similarities and differences. Honestly I gave this anime a 9/10 overall so I don't know why I'm breaking down each quality as though my opinion matters so fuck it HERE WE GO - ENJoyMENt & oVERALL 9 & 9- it was really GREAT ReAlLY GOOD ANIme HOPE you LIKE BEccause I LoVED IT. DEFnitely not foR tHE FAINT HEARted SO DONT WATCH iF U ARE a PUSSY. Go watch Infinite Stratos instead if you are.\\n\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This anime is for mature audiences.\r\nThis anime is currently on episode 12/12(Complete) and that deeply saddens me because this anime uses shock humor at its finest. If there is a weakness to this anime it's the over the top fan service; however, some may find this as a bonus (I don't).\r\nStory: 8/10-\r\nThe story is very entertaining and has good comedic value. There are many scenes I found enjoyable. Give the anime 4-5 episodes before you might drop it because the nonsense will make sense eventually. As redundant as that sounds trust me on this one. The plot is simple, but executed well. Overall Igave this an 8/10 for it's entertainment value and comedic expertise. If the plot were more intricate I could have graded the story higher. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was on par with many current anime's. It can be a little flashy and sexually explicit (more so sexually explicit) than other current anime. That is perfectly fine because the identity calls for it to a degree. I gave the art a 9/10 for its crisp clear visuals and its well formed variety of character expressions. \\n\\n\r\nSounds: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was competitive with other anime's, but did not standout. After watching the anime you won't remember the sound as much as the scene it was the background for. I think the sound suffered from the visuals and story, as they grabbed the viewers attention in a demanding way. For those reasons I gave the sound an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are very fun, light, and enjoyable (Chiyo Chan is adorable!!!). Their development is done considerably well when you take into account the length and purpose of this anime. I gave this a 8/10 for those reasons above.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI can't express how entertaining this anime is. This anime has absurd, but sharp comedic value. (*SPOILER ALERT*) (***DON'T READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE TO SEE SMALL SPOILER***) You have peeing on others, homosexual innuendos, and just shocking off the wall comedy. Watch with your own discretion.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nReview the above reasons to see specific details on why I believe this anime warrants a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful and enjoy the anime!",

            "content": "Prison School took me by surprise. I have never laughed so hard at something so degenerate, stupid, yet undeniably hilarious since GTO. The humor is so amazingly well executed that the stupidest things will drive the plot, which is surprisingly well done. One of the greatest strengths of Prison School is the voice acting, as all the proper screeches and fluctuations come in fitting times to make the experience worthwhile. There isn't much significant character development, a deep plot, or any of that, but rather this anime utilizes all the ideas we find ridiculous and mashes it together, backing the viewers out into a cornerwhere they have no choice but to laugh. The directing is great, as the animation is by the same studio that responsible for \"Shokugeki no Souma\". The camera angles are utilized to its fullest to provide the ultimate ecchi-comedic effect. Great anime to watch in groups, if you find a few friends who can see the humor in degeneracy. Very impressive overall, but if you don't find the first episode amusing, then don't bother with the rest. If you do, you're in for a ride, as each episode tops its previous shenanigans.",

            "content": "AS AN ANIME\r\nPrison School was without a doubt a surprise for a lot of viewers, even if I'm sure some of you fans of the manga were waiting for it (that was not my case).\r\nProduced by J.C. Staff,  a studio well-known for adapting mediocre light novels and for their bad deeds against reputed visual novels, their relatively poor artistic sense in comparison with competiting studios, and their more or less tight budget (generally more than less), Prison School's adaptation was kind of disappointing even before we could watch it. I myself didn't plan to see more than the first episode, and talking with someblinded fans of the manga beforehand didn't encourage me to review my position (don't ask me why, it's not even anticonformism but more something like disgust regarding their circlejerk for which I was insensible).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the first trailer came out and, stunned by the care given to the visuals, I was very decided to watch at least the beginning. Anyway, let's talk about the anime in itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who discovered Prison School for the first time (like me), some might have been a bit perplexed at the beginning, but quickly, without even liking that much this exagerated, distasteful ecchi side, everyone seemed to go along with the entertaining plot. To the point it became hard to wait for next week's episode, the suspense being definitely present, and sometimes unbearable. If what I'm saying is giving you hope to find again a good thriller series like Death Note, it's not a coincidence, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe manga plays a lot with parody. It parodies ecchi (some think so at least) by using it in a shameless and absolutely commercial manner, until it becomes, like I already said earlier, distasteful and taxing. But the adaptation goes further, until even mimicking the sonorities of Hollywood blockbuster movies' soundtracks, which award it, as an anime, a certain singularity, a really dramatic or even epic side. It also parodies thrillers like Death Note, or maybe even Prison Break (which I didn't see, so I'm only imagining), and from this absurd blend of absurd, erotism, pinch situations and friendship in a prison-school environment (?!) is born a funny mess in where each situation \u2014 and that is less true for their solution which seemed very well-thought and logical \u2014 seems to come from another world so much improbable they are.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is excellent in the end is definitely how the main characters succeeds to find their way out of the worst dead-ends, in a manner much more composed and believable than all the unbelievable shit that fall upon them. And it is, in a way, exhilarating, like a good Death Note, even if more original.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I couldn't wait for the end of the broadcasting so I started reading the manga after episode 4. Which made me realize some flaws inherent to the anime, which may not be noticeable or bugging when you only experienced this one. I don't really consider them like cons, or maybe yes I do, but I think it could have been way more awesome if this part would have had a better treatment.\\n\\n\r\nAS AN ADAPTATION\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the pacing. A flaw that I seem to often notice in recent anime adaptations like Parasyte, Seven Deadly Sins, Magi or even Hunter x Hunter 2011, and which seems be something like a new  trend or a commercial approach allowing to adapt more, while keeping a low number of episode which avoid fillers and also permit a constantly good animation quality all the way to the end without costing buckets (and all this by satsifying the general public, traumatized by Naruto fillers and One Piece's catastrophic recent episodes). I complain so much about those pacing issues these times that I feel obligated to talk about it, for once I make a review. Maybe I'll convince you, reader, and you'll finally understand why filler is, in itself, not a bad thing, and can be an intelligent way to give additional value to the adaptation, while saving money and time (for the long-running franchises at least).\\n\\n\r\nIt's when I read Prison School's manga that the parodying side of Death Note came to my eyes : the dark tones from some scenes, the camera angles and the internal monologues in pinch situations, the keikakus (it means plan). And it's very well done in the manga. And Death Note anime is very impressive too, because it adapts perfectly this psychological tension, while being very dynamic (it could have been slower and more boring like Monster \u2014 I like Monster), and the pacing doesn't feel too much rushed, the thought processes are well rendered and believably timed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the loss which come from the very fast pacing in the anime is unfortunately the intensity of the best psychological scenes (those with Hana, mainly), it goes fast, too fast, I personally found it difficult to feel worried about Kiyoshi's recurrent incredible and desperate situations. I'm not an expert, nor a scriptwriter, but I think that some added lines of introspective monologue, or silent stills to show the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, even filler,  would have helped to add a bit of hesitating emotions, and even some intensity, to those scenes.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, to put it simply, the anime's director gave us an external point of view of the scene, the one of a spectator, when the manga gave me a more \"in Kiyoshi\" feeling, which felt much more tense and desperate and made me worry about the next actions, \"what should he do, he's risking his social life right now, poor Kiyoshi\".\\n\\n\r\nThe \"external viewer\" point of view that the director put in place isn't in my opinion very appropriate because the jokes aren't so well-thought in themselves (it's just the level of absurdity that is amazing), so seen  from outside it just looks like some retarded chain of quickly happening dumb actions commited by the characters, when from an internal point of view, more introspective, everything at stake seem much more important and heavy. It's too bad, in my sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe other flaw in this anime is also, in my opinion, directly due to the fast-pacing. And it's much more to the core of the anime, so it's plain wrong. The problem when you go so fast, it's that the gags don't have the time to take properly effect. A big part of the comedy in this anime is absurd, but really some \"what the fuck did I just watch?!\" kind of absurd. The thing is, as a manga, Prison School give the reader one or two gag per chapter, so you can digest them with a laugh before reading the next chapter. But in the anime, and I have to precise beforehand that it adapted more or less 80 chapters in 12 episodes (didn't count exactly), the events and unbelievably ridiculous actions come one after another in pack of ten, the viewer don't have any time to integrate the joke, so it could have sink in.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a secret that for some jokes, the timing is very important. In Prison School, the joke that is supposed to make you laugh after 5 seconds, not because your brain is slow and that one is very subtle, but more because you really need 5 good seconds the realize the immensity of the ridiculousness of what just happened before your eyes, this awesome stupidity is sweeped away by the next one that comes only 3 seconds after and for which you will do your best to understand to follow the story, to finally sacrifice the comic potential of the situation. And I also think that's too bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the anime place itself in the grandstand, rather than wanting to be involved to understand what happens in the field, with the players, it's a shame but it is nevertheless a very good anime, granted with a good soundtrack and a stunning visual work, there's a lot of things that happens in the plot that will keep you from getting bored even if some joke, while staying always astounding, are less impacting than they could have been. And maybe you will succeed better than me at involving yourself in the characters through the anime, a thing I couldn't do with the pacing imposed on me by J.C. Staff.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those who loved the first season, you have to know that it is only the beginning and the sequel will be even better, the psycho-erotic frenzy really takes off at episodes 11-12, and a lot of the following event are equal or worth more than those, some reminding me a lot the deviant but intimate  perversion of manga like Nozoki Ana.",

            "content": "What a goddamn stupid-ass, asinine show.\r\nIt almost feels like one of those series that I'd be ashamed to have admitted enjoying, but there's something that  turns it into an ecchi comedy romp of a very impressive caliber. \r\nWhat elevates it above the others in its class (and the term \"class\" here is used very, very loosely) is its utter sincerity in its absurdity. It takes itself as seriously as possible with its pace and its *god-tier* sound and art direction which brings about an incredible sense of urgency for what is an incredibly dumb story premise. By taking itself seriously and going so farin it comes out the other side, it invites us to laugh at it and telegraphs to us that it knows how stupid it is. Bold, striking art and a hilariously complex orchestral score underline some of the best story moments and dramatic tension, using them as a vehicle for comedy simply by manipulating the tone of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis sort of expert manipulation applies *most* of the time. Meiko's scenes are shamelessly exploitative and her design is absurd, and I'm not a huge fan of her character, especially given how down-to-earth almost every other character's design is (although she shines as a caricature whenever she's partnered with Andre for a comedic scene). \\n\r\nHer use in the plot is mostly justified and it's great for a laugh when her sex appeal is actually used to drive the plot somehow, but her scenes are the closest to that feeling of actual sincerity to its fanservice and I honestly don't care for that a whole lot. Characters like her and several others pale in comparison to seeing characters like Hana, ones with developing internal conflicts and real struggles (albeit hilarious ones).\\n\r\nAs \"real\" as they can get within the boundaries of the high school comedy genre, anyway.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, this is a lot more words than is really deserved for a show this stupid. But it is unflinching in its stupidity and dares to go beyond. It's something to be both respected and laughed at.",

            "content": "I came across Prison School after checking the top seasonal anime. At first glance I believed it to be nothing of interest, as I am not a fan of ecchi anime. However, after watching the first few episodes I came to understand why it was among the higher ranks of its season.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIf I had one word to describe the story of Prison School, I would call it absurd. The simple story that boys can get locked into a school prison is completely nonsensical. However, upon closer evaluation, where does something like this even show up? It is so ridiculous that it can be describedas uncommon. Therefore, it avoids the the usual tag that people like to throw onto shows. Generic. If the story is not good, it will at least be interesting.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is a eight. I usually don't bicker too much about art as long as the animation does its job. However the one downside about the graphics of the show is the abundance of censorship. While I do believe that it is probably needed, it can get a little awkward at times and for some, it is even annoying to an extent.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music for the anime is a eight. I usually have the same rule for sound as I do art. However, in this case, the sound not only functions within the anime, but it adds a little. \\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines the most. The five boys that enter the prison are already very interesting characters. However, the one thing that makes characters good is change. In prison school change becomes something very apparent. As the five boys continually face challenges, they change a lot throughout the series. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAre you serious? This is most definitely a ten. The anime shines the most with its sense of humor. The absurdity of the anime, the strange characters, even the music and art contribute to the overall humor of the anime. If anything, this aspect of the show will always make you want to watch the next episode!\\n\r\nOverall: B\\n\r\nWell the mean of my evaluations round up to 8.6. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons that I feel that the show is a B and not higher. This has a lot to do with the discrepancy of character development. While three of the five boys were given a deep character, two of them didn't really get highlighted. Also the fact that the censorship was everywhere did make the show a little bit worse in presentation.",

            "content": "Prison School is the love child of a raunchy teen movie and a grisly \u201970s exploitation flick that successfully balances comedy, sex, and violence. Viewers are never left fatigued from any single element of the show because it knows how and when to give and how and when to pull back. This mastery is what takes the ingredients of what would otherwise be an unremarkable ecchi show and transforms them into something quite exceptional.\r\nMake no mistake about it: Prison School is, at its core, a comedy. Jokes are mostly of the dick-and-fart variety, but rather than hang its hat on lazy, throwaway one-liners, the showinstead carefully takes its time in constructing and delivering jokes. Setups are thoughtfully prepared and allowed to marinate, and then when the right opportunity presents itself, punchlines come out in full force and in unexpected ways, which is why even the crudest, most lowbrow material can make viewers hold their sides with laughter. Furthermore, because the show makes an effort to seamlessly integrate jokes and gags into its plot, the aftermath of the delivery is far more rewarding than it would be from a standalone joke, as can often be seen in scenarios involving callbacks. \\n\\n\r\nThe stylized sexuality found in Prison School is a rare example of fan service complementing a show\u2019s story. Generally, fan service runs the risk of detracting from an otherwise enjoyable show; at best, it adds nothing of substance, and at worst, it is a bothersome distraction. However, as it is in the cases of many teen sex comedies, fan service actually enhances the story here because it is one told from the perspective of horny teenage boys, who from the outset crave the attention\u2014any attention\u2014of the opposite sex. We, the viewers, are able to understand the Prison School world through their eyes, where peeping toms are the heroes and the ones who seek to punish them are the villains. Thus, things like ever-jiggling breasts and all-too-convenient upskirt shots never seem inappropriate or extraneous and are brilliantly effective in properly conveying the amusing hormonal plight of the protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nStill, because of such prevalent vulgar humor and hypersexualization, the show seems as though it is constantly in danger of being monopolized by bawdy jokes and T&A at the expense of everything else it has to offer. Fortunately, timely bouts of exaggerated violence, a core component of the exploitation films Prison School shares so much in common with, remind both the viewers as well as the protagonists of their grim reality. Even though the context of the violence is frequently comedic, the sheer brutality of it nonetheless illustrates that their prison life is not all sexy fun and games. The bloodshed and cruelty, coupled with increasing stakes as the story unfolds, gives much-needed weight to their desperate mission to leave the prison and be reinstated as students.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School makes no apologies for what it is, nor should it have to. From the beginning, the viewer is told of all the smut and obscenities to come, and the show never wavers in delivering. It is not the first show to prominently feature some combination of comedy, sex, and violence, but it stands out because it succeeds in its execution of all three, skillfully juggling them and never allowing any single one to completely dominate the entire show.",

But when a friend sorta forced me to eat it with him, I ended up really, really, REALLY enjoying it. It definitely was grotesque and disgusting looking, I normally don't like my pizza with anchovies. But aside from all that the flavours it also gave was just so overpowering and meaningful. I found myself bewildered at howmuch it managed to change my mind. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to hate this pizza, I wanted to find every excuse to drop it. But I gave it a chance and each bite kept proving me wrong and it ended up being one of the funnest and tastiest pizza I've ever had.

I have never watched ecchi before and when I saw the first episode, I was floored by how gross and explicit it was at times. So I dropped it for a while, and then got convinced by my friend to keep on watching when the anime already had 10 episodes. I consumed all of them in one day and I loved it. \r\nI have no excuse. This anime is vile, it is disgusting and it is also hilarious. The art is fantastic, very well drawn, the music fits the show incredibly well,the voice actors do all sorts of ridiculous things and it's just... the ultimate guilty pleasure, I should think. The fact that they got such bigshot seiyuus to voice this speaks for itself, I should think. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're not too squeamish (there's lots of cleavage, butt humor and also public defecation \u2013 not explicit but it's still there \u2013 then go for it. This anime will definitely be remembered. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, though, I still have no idea why I like it, I just do, and so do many other people. I was very interested in seeing the ending, and if there is a season two, I will definitely watch it (much to the horror of my more PG-13 friends).",

            "content": "Yours truly is here to write a review about one of your truly's favorite anime this season.\r\nWhen I first looked at the tags for this anime, I though it looked fairly promising, \"Comedy, Ecchi, Romance, School, Seinen.\" Definitely a stereotypical romantic comedy, right?\r\nOh boy was I wrong. This was nothing like the stereotypical anime that I was expecting, but I guess I'll just get into the parts of the anime right away.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story was good in comparison to any average anime, and very good in comparison to other romantic comedies, that are almost 100% slice of life and gag comedy. The premise is interestingin that instead of one main guy and his one dimensional buddy, we have 5 pretty unique guys. First episode features these 5 socially awkward guys in a formerly all-girls' school. Weird stuff happen and they get locked up in a prison that is on school grounds. Umm.... yeah.... Like I said the premise is pretty weird, but very unique. I haven't read the manga that the anime is based off of, but in that respect, I think the anime did a good job in adapting and definitely in making the viewers enjoy (I'll get more into this later).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nLet me be clear. If you came here looking for ecchi, you came to the right place. The art could use some getting used to. I personally didn't hate it, but didn't like it too much either. It doesn't have the stereotypical anime girl art to say the least. The backgrounds are very nicely drawn and the character faces are just so side-splittingly hilarious, sometimes I found myself pausing the show just to laugh my head off. Sometimes, I even rewatched certain parts to get more laughs off. I personally didn't like the immense amount of ecchi, especially with certain parts blurred out and whatnot, but it was definitely bearable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOh boy, the sounds were amazing, from the voice actors to the background noises. Especially anything involving the vice president, I pretty much always got some giggles out of that. I thoroughly enjoyed the detail in which the background noises, like how clothes sound like when you move in them, or clothes ripping, or a certain someone pooping their pants... Yeah. I said it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nLike I said before, there are 5 main guys all with unique personalities. Some of them are pretty nasty, I'll have to admit, but all are hilarious in their own aspect. My two favorite main guys were Kiyoshi and Gakuto just because they reached such a great dynamic with each other that whenever they came on screen together, I had to prepare myself. However, despite me singing praises, the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. Sure they do have their moments of brilliance, but overall, you can sorta predict what's going to happen, heck, even the prison guys could predict the actions of the USC members.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs you could probably guess from my praises on praises above, I really like the show. It truly was a fresh air to the stereotypical romantic comedies out there and ecchis out there. Everything from the art to the sound came in sync with each other to make a super fun, super funny, amazing anime. I haven't watched too many anime from this season, but I think Prison School really stands out in the ecchi and comedy departments.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review. I can't really tell how long it's going to be because I'm typing in a super small box, but if it's really long sorry teehee:P.\\n\\n\r\np.s. If you plan to start watching, look forward to episode 11. It's crazy funny.",

            "content": "Story (5): First and foremost, this series is not meant to be taken seriously, and I think a lot of people fail to recognize that before starting it. It's pretty much a parody; it's the unapologetic, over the top ecchiness/comedy that manages to carry the ridiculous setting/plot line and the series sticks to its guns in that regard. Take out the fan service/ecchiness (its essence), you essentially have a thin, slice of life story about high school boys being... high school boys. If you're completely opposed to sex jokes and are2edgy (as there already seems to be indications of elsewhere) well, don't watch. Idk whatelse you would expect after reading the premise. I mean the cover picture alone should tell you enough about its target audience/genre. My story score of 5 though is trying to be objective as possible keeping said people in mind, along with the other different types of anime enthusiasts, but honestly if this series is up your alley in terms of comedy/open mindedness to ecchiness you'll definitely rate it higher.\\n\\n\r\nHere is an interesting side note about the mangaka I've read in various discussions online; His previous main series, Ore to Akuma no Blues, was a much more serious-toned manga about the historical American South/Blues scene that apparently did not do very well sales wise and subsequently prompted him to present works to his editor that were ridiculously over the top in fan service (aka Prison School) catered to the general public. Ironically enough, Prison School to date has become his biggest success lol.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): If there is anything that this series outshines all others in, it's the art. Obviously it looks pretty in HD animation, but to get a better idea of how skilled the mangaka's drawings are all you need do is see a random page out of the Prison School manga as compared to any other random manga. This being an Ecchi work only enhances this. What I love most personally is that the character facial features tend to be of more \"realistic\" proportions, as in not the traditional super large eyes with barely visible nose, if one exists at all. On top of that, each significant character's face is subtly distinct from one another where they can be somewhat distinguished from face alone (like Kiyoshi's face compared to Shingo's), as compared to completely relying on different hair style/color in other media. The appreciation of this becomes a little more apparent in the would-be characters introduced in a potential season 2. IMHO it's the best art I've seen in manga/anime period.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): The OP/ED are apparently anime original, and IMO nothing special. Not bad, but not something I would listen to by itself. The overall soundtrack chosen though for the actual episode content I feel was very, very well done. From well timed over the top, traditional orchestra to emphasize the comedic/parody aspects talked about above, to the Chinese instrumental music to accompany Gakuto and the Three Kingdoms, everything is well timed/appropriately chosen. Overall, the sound/music thoroughly enhances the entire comedic value this show has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7): Character development wise there isn't anything too significant to squeeze in within the given 12 episodes. More manga content would have to be adapted to see that. However, from the male protagonists perspective, what you get throughout the story is high school male bonding at its finest, with the plot doing everything it can to test said male bonds/friendships. Character wise, the MC (Kiyoshi) is used to connect to the viewers as he is the most \"normal\" of the bunch (Shingo as well, but he isn't the MC). The other male characters, though relatable in some respects, all have hilariously unique/original quirks that drive the story's comedy. The girls likewise are all uniquely (sadistically) distinct from each other, though in some of respects contain many cliche anime tropes. The best aspect of the characters though is the relationships in the unique rapport/wit built between each individual male prisoner/female overseer, from labels like \"Brown Thunder\" to \"Masochistic Slave\" lol.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): Like I said, if you understand going into the series that this show embodies ecchiness/fan service/sex driven comedy to its very core, you will enjoy it. If you're looking for something serious/more meaningful in its theme or message, why the f*ck would you choose to watch this? As a male in his mid 20s, I found this to be one of the best comedies I've had in a long while, that former detail being very important. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): Again, I will reiterate for a third and last time, understand what you're getting into beforehand by realizing the genre/type of audience this show is catered to. Though the story premise is ridiculous, the mangaka does a great job at unabashedly recognizing that and turns said ridiculousness into all out \"I can't believe that just happened\" comedy that is ultimately enhanced by the superb art/sound, making it a highly rated overall experience for me. If you're not into ecchi/sex jokes I can understandably see why you wouldn't rate highly of the show, but I wouldn't be able to understand what compelled you to watch the show in its entirety in the first place. Seriously, you'll be able to tell within the first 2 episodes whether you like the series or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review btw, I tried my best to be somewhat balanced in bringing to light what this show is really all about while also addressing some points to those who will have a problem with it.\\n\\n",

Let the rant begin:\r\nStory: Sadistic (it's not even the right word for it, because calling them sadists is an insult to sadists!)monsters, without any redeemable features, imprison, severly injure and torture five typical high school boys. That might sound a bit harsh, but in my opinion that's exactly what's happening there.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy all the violence (usually I like that in anime). \\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the ecchi (usually I like that in anime - come on who doesn't like boobies?

I was surprise by how much it surprised me. It's definitely not for everyone but for the people that don't mind a story that really only takes place in one area this is a very good choice. \r\nArt and Animation (10/10) Masterpiece \r\nI'm going to start taking about both art and animation in this section for now on. Animation must be talked about. So both Artand Animation is done by J.C. Staff Studio and I have to give it to these guys that they have to be the best at creating ecchi series they've done quite a lot in the past if you look up their resume but this one has to be the best and their budget and work put behind it speaks for itself.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Masterpiece\\n\\n\r\nThe character's voice acting, anime opening and ending, sound effects, and BGM all outstanding. I have to wear my surround sound headphones when watching this series when the series when it starts to get serious and their BGM starts to play the dramatic scenes really feel so much more impact with the choice of music that they have made you have to be deaf retard to not give them a perfect score in the section. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) Outstanding \\n\\n\r\nThe character roster in Prison School for what type of genre anime this is understand is at the top of it's food chain. Not once have I personally watched an anime to have such an interesting cast of characters on both the protagonist group and the antagonist group every character that was introduce felt relevant and outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nOther than majority of episode 1 (basically till the end of episode one with the Hana scene) every episode in this 12 episode anime had me hooked in with enjoyment. The opening and ending song i love and the comedy in this anime is amazing not a lot of comedy anime these days are actually funny to me. I was always excited to watch a Prison School episode because none felt like a waste and it never disappointed me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.60/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nPrison School was flat out amazing to me it's definitely my favorite anime and also in my opinion as far as this Summer Season of Anime of 2015 the best one. Maybe is I watched Rokka No Yusha which I heard is better than it my opinion may have been different but I didn't so don't disagree with what I think is the best because I haven't seen things people say are better, so to me Prison School is the best anime of the summer season of anime for 2015, it's also the most surprisingly impressive on also. I thought I would give this series a high 7 to mid 8 I have no clue it would be so close to a 10 for me and it deserves to be this high. I hope that J.C. Staff makes a season 2 because they setup for it at the end of episode 12 which you would assume they would make another but you know nothing is guaranteed these days but this series deserves it!",

The hyperbolic setup for this series destroyed any semblance of hope I had in this anime.",

            "content": "An extreme comedy about a daring group of students who, well, want to catch some chicks. The show stops at nothing to deliver on laughs so be cautious about age appropriate watching. I'd call it \"a no boundaries comedy with just as much fan service as disservice\". If I had to say something bad about the show it would be that the show may be difficult to watch with others or in public. The art takes a bit of getting used to, but becomes a core part of the comedic value once you get used to it. If I had to say something good aboutthis show it would easily be the soundtrack. An unusually well composed and elaborate soundtrack adds great value to many hilarious and odd scenes. (It's personally in my top 10 anime soundtracks very much worth collecting). Voice acting delivers constantly time and time again with clever and ridiculous lines that make eating while watching dangerous. The pacing is very easy to follow, not that the plot is complex. Animation has it's moments and has it's epic moments that are not easily forgotten. \\n\r\nOverall it's a crude and irreverent comedy that should absolutely not be taken seriously. Some will enjoy it's clever humor while others will find it too far over the top and exaggerated. Favorite characters: Chairman, Gakuto, Hana. I give it a 9/10 and remain hopeful for a 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Version: Wild, exaggerated comedy with great lines. Abnormally crude, but delivers on laughs in brilliant ways. NOT for everyone, may traumatize younger audiences.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nPrison has a lot negative connotations attached to it. Prison is a place where the wrongdoers of society go as punishment for their crimes against humanity. From killing to theft, prison is designed as a correctional institute. Whether or not that actually happens is a topic for another day, but at the minimum prison, as people know it, is a place that you do not want to end up.\r\nPrison School is the same. \u201cSchool\u201d in the title should not fool anyone; this prison is more like a torture chamber than a place of reform. That soundsabsurd \u2013 and it is \u2013 but that is exactly what the anime thrives on: absurdity. Of course there are other undeniable motifs throughout the show but those, too, always have their absurdity cranked up to eleven and then some.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about myself, I have never been to prison (and I plan to keep it that way forever). Furthermore neither my immediate nor extended family has ever had anyone in prison. My father did go to his local jail once when he was in his late teens, though. He and his friends had gotten into a scuffle with others, landing them all in a jail cell for the night. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t scared of the place,\u201d my father always says when recounting this small tale, \u201cI was scared of what my dad was going to do me when he found out.\u201d And that surmises Prison School pretty well: it is not the prison, but the people, that should be feared.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIn order to understand Prison School, one has to be prepared for the absence of shame. This anime is not afraid to debase itself. By never being ashamed, the anime achieves its comedy through a variety of means that, ultimately, lead into the bigger picture of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe first of these means is the over-the-top scenarios the characters constantly find themselves in. While this is a realistic show in the sense that the setting, people, and outcomes are seen in everyday life, Prison School always makes sure to go one step further. For instance, Andre keeps a diary detailing all of his punishments, but the cutesy, kiddy nature of the violent depictions makes the diary more like a children\u2019s book rather than a fetish-filled notebook. Similar is during the arm-wrestling match. During Kiyoshi\u2019s turn, he gets sent into a daze when he sees the vice-president\u2019s nipple. A daze so deep that he does not notice that his arm has been essentially twisted backwards. These types of scenes work as well as they do because of the contrast between the reality of the show and the imaginary portrayal that the aspects often take.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School does not always lean on the ridiculous to elicit laughs from its audience. The anime can actually be quite clever with its jokes, relying on its context and its expectations to use yet another form of comedy. One of the earlier examples of this is when Kiyoshi and Gakuto are together in the shower. Shingo misunderstands the situation; from his and subsequently the audience\u2019s point-of-view, Kiyoshi and Gakuto appear to be taking part in a \u201cdon\u2019t drop the soap\u201d scene, utilizing a known prison trope. Another example is when the gang forgives Shingo for his misdeeds, apparently upholding that friendship comes first. But after he confesses what he had been doing with Anzu, specifically her \u201cdownblouse and nip-slip\u201d, the boys proceed to beat the snot out of him. Again, these scenes are funny because they both rely on the context of the given setting and on the flipping of initial expectations.\\n\\n\r\nFor Prison School, it takes the ridiculousness and the cleverness to get at its next brand of comedy. The show has a weird focus on both domination and degradation. The women in the anime are, sexually speaking, dominatrix. They whip the prisoners, they are evil towards the prisoners, and they look down on the prisoners. That is to say, the women are constantly put on a pedestal above the men. Granted, the men do have their dominating moments, too. Gakuto smashing his prized figurines and Andre\u2019s nipple hair, while not directly dominating the women, are events where they overpower their captors. Yet the anime also does the complete opposite. Meiko is known to sweat profusely due to the sheer gravitas of their leader. Hana at one point is peed on. Mari, the student council president, unbeknownst to her, eats a handful of dirty peanuts. As for the men, they usually occupy this camp. They are constantly humiliated throughout the season, such as when Gakuto defecates himself on purpose to get a sound-clip of some bathroom noises or Kiyoshi makes the stupidest face possible when taking a selfie with Chiyo.\\n\\n\r\nBut Prison School shines brightest when it combines these features simultaneously, achieving a harmony of domi-grading proportions. A highlight from the show is Hana\u2019s \u201cMedusa\u201d, encapsulating the power she holds over the situation while also insulting her severely with the comparison to an ugly, mythological snake-creature. These dominating and degrading scenes would presumably not be comedic due to the definition of the words; watching someone get mercilessly abused or lambasted is not normally funny. But because they are as crazy and inventive as they end up being, the show manages to make even these touchy subjects fun.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of these separate examples demonstrate where the comedy is most often derived: sex. Without a doubt,Prison School\u2019s most utilized asset is sex, sexual exploits a way to obtain the trifecta that is absurdity, shame, and comedy. Otherwise known as \u201cecchi\u201d content, the anime rarely has nonsexual downtime, and due to the amount of sex, there are no boundaries for the show. The sexual content can reach quite the crude levels. In-your-face calisthenics, \u201cmushroom\u201d touching, and a butt-shaped mouse pad are merely a sampling of the perverted material that the show regularly presents in a comedic fashion. This should not be taken lightly. Whether it is the vice-president wearing a much-too-tight outfit or the Kurhiara sisters touching the tube that Kiyoshi had equipped minutes before, sex permeates the anime like pornography fills the Internet.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly the sexual content is not just used for comedic purposes. Sex also plays a meaningful role as well. To be fair, the anime does have sexual moments that are purely aimed at arousal; the Meiko cleaning the president\u2019s body in the shower or Meiko (a lot of the sex revolves around the vice-president\u2026) getting her underwear caught on a door handle serves little else than to please the audience. But even these moments, like the more meaningful, drive Prison School. \u201cDrive\u201d in every sense of the word. The plot begins only because the boys are deviants \u2013 peeping on the girls in the bathroom. Their biggest motivational factor is sex \u2013 the feeling of a girl\u2019s chest pressed against their face and the prospect of a wet T-shirt contest. How they escape from sticky situations \u2013 explaining the evolution of the female body and an intense make-out session. The teenage boys\u2019 hormones more or less force them forward. Thus sex is not just used for comedy or for pleasure. Sex is what pushes the narrative along.\\n\\n\r\nTaken together, there is more to Prison School than meets the eye. Intriguingly, Prison School can be interpreted allegorically. People are driven by sex. Scientifically speaking, everyone is programmed to seek out sex as a means for genetic propagation. Sex is an inherent, and indeed natural, part of life. This can be extended beyond humanity and to society; entertainment like Prison School uses sex as a selling point because that is what people are drawn to. Sex controls people, influences people. In other words, sex makes people prisoners to themselves. That is the metaphor. The prison in Prison School represents the dominating hold that sex has on the lives people lead. And as was said, sex is both the cause and the savior within the narrative. So paradoxically sex is something that is always around even when it is not and allegorically sex is something that is inescapable.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not this interpretation is true is certainly up for debate, but regardless Prison School executes every part of its narrative as best as it can. The comedy is diverse, the \u201cecchi\u201d content is purposeful, and the ending \u2013 the three main women going to the prison, providing some satisfying role-reversal and full-circle framing \u2013 is as successful as it could be. Meaning, shame or no shame, the anime easily made bail.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Prison School, the anime sees a small step down in the artistic and animation department. This is almost entirely at the hands of the censoring that is overly employed. Crotches are blackened out and beams of light cover chests, obviously getting in the way of the \u201cecchi\u201d content. Given that the sex is such an integral part to the show, hiding a sizeable portion of it behind censorship is nothing short of a bad move.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the art is a different story. Despite the show taking place in pretty much the exact same area \u2013 the school-grounds prison \u2013 Prison School gets quite inventive with the way in which it presents everything. The camera direction especially sees a variety of angles, perspectives, and zooms, giving the anime a dynamic feel that fits comfortably with the craziness that the events are so often steeped in. This craziness likewise gives the show the chance to be as imaginative as possible. Gakuto\u2019s historic idols drinking together or Kiyoshi defending butts over boobs are chances for the show to get away from the prison and the school while also remaining contextually relevant and adding to its comedy. Speaking of comedy, the anime also focuses on the reactions of the characters. Andre getting desperate, Joe looking murderous, and Shingo acting creepy take advantage of the anime\u2019s over-the-top tendencies, which in turn produce even more comedic moments. Most notably is Hana, whose face goes through every range of emotion \u2013 insanity, pleasure, and anger to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are a mixed offering. Kiyoshi is decidedly plain, his short hair and normal looks meant for the audience to self-insert themselves as him. This works but the result is that his design is rather boring, especially compared to the rest of the cast. Shingo is similar, although his slick-backed blonde hair and \u201cYankee\u201d face give him a cool vibe. Chiyo and Anzu, the women who have a romantic relationship with Kiyoshi and Shingo respectively, are likewise plain in their designs \u2013 cute faces and shoulder-length brown hair. It is not until Mari, Chiyo\u2019s older sister and the student council president, do the designs start to flourish. Her long black hair, leg-long black tights, and icy, teal eyes paint her as not just the leader but as someone to be feared. Her and Chiyo\u2019s father dons a trimmed mustache and a blue tie, turning him into quite the gentleman. Andre\u2019s small face, huge stature, and floppy ears create a walking clown. Joe\u2019s defined but hidden face and small height make him an enigma. Hana\u2019s loose pants are meant for easier karate movement but they also reduce her overall sex appeal, contrasting with the other women of the show and with her (unintentional) perverted habits. But the best design goes to Meiko. Her absurdly large breasts, glasses, and gray-with-bun hair give her a very mature look, coinciding with her commanding position. Her knee-high black boots and leather riding crop add further to her dominatrix personality and persona, collectively making her design the most intricate of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nFor all of the designs, everyone has very refined contours, shadows, and detail that makes them realistic and impactful, regardless of how boring some might be. These highly detailed designs surprisingly do not get in the way of the amount of animation that is used. Prison School does have a sizeable chunk of \u201cvisible\u201d animation \u2013 eyes can go chaotic, limbs fly during violent segments, and breasts jiggle. But there are also subtle movements like twitching and hair ruffling that exist to keep the anime flowing. A possible explanation may be due to the fact that the anime prides itself on capturing each ridiculous moment. Meaning, the anime constantly has prolonged shots of the characters\u2019 faces or the current situation. This consequently reduces the overall amount of animation for those scenes but the trade-off is that the more involved ones receive even more animation. It is a trade-off, one in which Prison Schooldiscovered a nice balance.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Prison School are not complex characters in the slightest. For the most part, they are made up solely of their base characterizations. Given the comedy-centric direction, this makes perfect sense; Kiyoshi the straight-man, Gakuto the hobbyist, Shingo the dude, Andre the gentle giant, and Joe the reserved. The same line of thinking can be applied to the women; Mari the vixen, Meiko the buff, and Hana the psycho. The characters are who they are and not much more.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNot much\u201d because there is thought put into some of the characters. Mari, the student council president, is infamous for her adoration and control of crows. Crows are intelligent creatures, some of the smartest nonhuman animals on the planet. They are also ominous; their pitch-black feathers and foreboding cry are creepy, especially when these birds fly in flocks. No better bird symbolizes the equally intelligent and ominous Mari. But as the anime depicts, Mari is not as smart or as scary as one is lead to believe. Her plan falls through and while she has a deep-seeded hatred for men \u2013 most likely the result of a disconnect with her father \u2013 she is regularly shown to care for all of the women. She offers them positions, she shares tea with them, and in Hana\u2019s case, she stops her from doing any more damage than has already been done when she takes a punch meant for Kiyoshi for herself. In other words, Mari has an inversion about her that makes her the opposite of what she appears to be.\\n\\n\r\nHana is also an interesting character in her own right. Arguably she is the least attractive of the women, mostly because of her personality, looks, and actions. But she, more than any of the women, finds herself always at the brunt end of the stick. Simultaneously, she is the most immature in the sense that she has no idea what an erection is or how to kiss. Again, there is an inversion present, one that flips the audience\u2019s perception of her.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately inversion is what the characters rely on to achieve their brand of comedy. Andre is a very calm and very nice person, thus his love of punishment and lack of receiving it is comedic. Meiko acting high and mighty towards the boys but then going fully submissive towards Mari is comedic. Chiyo\u2019s father nonchalantly having pornography lying around when his daughter is nearby is comedic.\\n\\n\r\nInversion, like the sexual material, also does more than act as a comedic crutch. Looking at Shingo\u2019s character throughout the season, he was initially placed on the wayside. It was not until Kiyoshi and Gakuto were caught that he more or less takes center stage during the season. When he learns of Kiyoshi\u2019s behavior \u2013 that he had gone behind his, Andre\u2019s, and Joe\u2019s backs in order to meet up with some girl and that he had caused their prison stay to lengthen \u2013 he shuns Kiyoshi, mistreating him as much as possible. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to do the exact same as Kiyoshi (technically he did even more by getting free meals, going outside, and personally betraying his friends), he does not hesitate. It was hypocritical, or considering the discussion, it was an inversion of his character. And it is this same inversion that he witnesses with a bunch of young kids that opens his eyes to how childish he had been. In the end he realizes the error of his ways and the group comes together once more, appropriately enough ending on a joke relying on inversion.\\n\\n\r\nGakuto is also a prime example of the anime\u2019s reliance on inversion. Gakuto is a bit of an oddball. He is obsessed with history and speaks in a strange manner. He is also very respectful, a trait derived from the previous two. But despite what he does or says, he rarely acts selfish. That is to say, Gakuto might seem like an attention seeker but he is the first to sacrifice himself before anyone. Embarrassing himself in front of the whole school, destroying his prized figures, and refusing to \u201cbesmirch\u201d (Gakuto\u2019s words) Chiyo\u2019s clothes are just a sampling of the individual instances where Gakuto chooses his friends over himself.\\n\\n\r\nFriendships feed directly into relationships, another staple of Prison School. Kiyoshi\u2019s relationship with both Chiyo and Hana is bizarre. The former is more or less a lie \u2013 he does not really like sumo wrestling and he never told her the truth about the peeping \u2013 whereas the latter goes way too far for mere acquaintances. Furthermore, Kiyoshi\u2019s crow-helping and butt-worshipping has made him into, according to the Kurihara family members, not a \u201cbad\u201d guy. To put it differently, Kiyoshi having a relationship with them requires him to uphold quite the niche stipulation. Joe has his ants that mean more to him than any girl could \u2013 the final sequence shows all of the boys with a woman except Joe who, coincidentally enough, is with his ants. But the most important set of relationships within the anime are the ones between the men. They each have those moments where they forget the others \u2013 Kiyoshi going on his date, Shingo sneaking out, Andre succumbing to depravity, Joe overcome with venomous rage, and, surprisingly yes, Gakuto ignoring Kiyoshi for some period. Their time in prison seemingly breaks the friendships they had. However, through their determination for each other (and for sex), the boys rise above their misdeeds. Each person, at one point or another, apologizes and, like friends do, they forgive them, reconstructing their bonds to be even stronger than before. And this is what the characters represent thematically. What gets somebody through tough times is not some figurines or a few ants or even a personal diary. What gets somebody through tough times are the people that person holds dear.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to Prison School, relationships are coveted. Thus, the only prominent time in which the cast weakens is when these relationships are prevented from developing. This stunted growth is caused by the disproportionate on-screen time. The show focuses mainly on Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Meiko, and Hana, and to be fair this makes sense since they are arguably the funniest characters in the anime. And given that this is a comedy, having the most fun cast members at the front more so than the others is a logical move. Still, Andre and Joe are hardly used throughout the season, both receiving two, very brief spotlights (Andre with his non-punishment and nipple hair, and Joe with his ants and deception). Arguably again, Andre and Joe exist just for their silly personas and nothing more, and given that there are the other three boys and a handful of girls to focus on, those two not getting much attention is somewhat understandable.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is still the issue of Shingo \u2013 who has no presence in the beginning, takes over briefly, then disappears again \u2013 and Mari \u2013 who is technically the kingpin of the whole fiasco but is rarely shown doing much of anything. So, dissimilar to the animation, Prison School misses the balance in regards to its characters and their on-screen time. This has a domino effect: less of the characters means less foundation for the relationships they share with the others, a dampening in the relationships hurts the theme, and damaging the theme lowers the overall execution of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is rock-and-roll heavy, but what it champions is the theme the show\u2019s characters symbolize; switching off the vocalists achieves that friendship feel. The piece is also satirical, the hard instruments contrasting with the silly lyrics. Yet the lyrics also correlate to the allegorical interpretation presented earlier. \u201cThe heart is an endless love prison\u201d gets at the notion that what one feels makes us prisoners to ourselves. Repetition is also prevalent. In the context of Prison School, the repetition symbolizes the repetitive nature that a stay in prison induces. Combined with the actual composition of the track, there is no denying the strength of the OP.\\n\\n\r\nAs is common with ending themes, the ED forms a dichotomy with the OP, taking more of a party route. At the minimum the ED is more relaxed than the OP. The ED also aims at the other focus of the show; showing the different women in suggestive poses mirrors the anime\u2019s content and, once again, reflects the manlier opening theme. The song itself is lighthearted, catchy, and fun and, like the OP, the lyrics reinforce the allegory: \u201cFalling in love with someone is a trap programmed into our genes\u201d. It is a silly song, one that rests comfortably among Prison School\u2019s comedic origins.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the show also has a high amount of quality. Katsuyuki Konishi as Gakuto hits a home run, his honorifics, his honorable tone, and his quickness of speech fitting the character perfectly. Kana Hanazawa as Hana proved that she could provide a voice that was less cutesy and more guttural, her angry voice capturing the oft-angry girl well. Shizuka Itou as Meiko also deserves a shout-out for giving the mature, dominating girl the womanly and commanding voice that she needed. And one would be remiss if Chinami Hashimoto as Chiyo was not given some kind of praise. In one of her first big roles, her girly voice demonstrated that she has a future in the voice acting business.\\n\\n\r\nAkin to the censoring, the sound-work takes a slight step down in the original soundtrack department. The majority of the tracks are there for the mood and little else. A heavenly track for the sexual moments, orchestral ensembles to raise tension, and guitar strings for the triumphant victories, to sample a few. While they do increase the level of emotion for their respective scenes, the OST is by no means a memorable outing, especially when compared to the rest of the music let alone the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a doozy.\\n\\n\r\nI do not fault anyone for avoiding this show based purely on the amount of violence, perversion, and insanity that it contains. While I would not say that this is a show for the faint of heart, this is a show that requires a bit of tolerance on the viewer\u2019s end. Realistically, given the \u201cseinen\u201d genre tag, someone going into this one should know it is meant for a more mature audience, so maybe a warning of any kind is not warranted.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I found this show nothing short of hilarious. The altercations between Kiyoshi and Hana were especially funny. The funniest part during their final spat was not the Medusa or the vigorous making-out. It was when Kiyoshi gave Hana \u201cpermission\u201d to hit him as payback, but after the seventh or so punch (the sound-effects and animation during this segment are top-notch) he desperately asks her to stop because he did not realize it would hurt so much. Afterwards, too, where the other boys were flabbergasted at what exactly could have gone down in the office, capped off this episodes-spanning scene nicely.\\n\\n\r\nBut Hana also induces one of my biggest peeves with the anime: the faux romantic relationship between her and Kiyoshi. Obviously Kiyoshi likes Chiyo and Chiyo likes Kiyoshi. Nobody can deny that. And I loved seeing them care about each other. Chiyo standing up against her tyrant of a sister for Kiyoshi and Kiyoshi going so far as to cross-dress in order to fulfill his promise to Chiyo made my heart flutter. So when Hana showed up, sharing her privacy, sidling up next to Kiyoshi, and even stealing his first kiss, made me not angry or annoyed but sad. Sad because I know how Kiyoshi and Chiyo feel about one another and sad because Chiyo deserves better. Chiyo is sweet, thoughtful, and compassionate, so seeing her relationship with Kiyoshi tampered with \u2013 worse still, all of it happening without her knowing \u2013 just did not sit right with me. I am aware that this was all done for comedic purposes. Kiyoshi also justifies that the kiss was not his \u201ctrue\u201d first and even if it was what mattered most was him succeeding in his endeavor so that he and his friends could stay and that he could spend more time with Chiyo. But being the romance aficionado that I am, watching Kiyoshi and Chiyo\u2019s pure relationship constantly messed up by Hana saddened me.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a minor grievance. The rest of the anime, truth be told, consistently put a smile on my face. Gakuto\u2019s dumb analogies, Meiko unsure if she should point out the redundancy of \u201cDTO Operation\u201d, Shingo amazed as Anzu stepped over him in the movie theater, Kiyoshi unable to stop himself from continuing to argue the superiority of butts over boobs, and the way Chiyo\u2019s father talked were all moments that had me laughing. Likewise, the over-the-top, sexual, and degrading comedy was impossible to sit through without chuckling out loud. I remember always saying something to the effect of \u201cThis show\u2026\u201d every time something completely absurd happened. That was practically what the anime mostly ended up doing, so I was saying that phrase more times than I would care to admit.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School accomplishes a lot over the span of twelve episodes. The comedy always works wonders, the artistic direction is flavorful, and the cast represents more than just their base characteristics. The censoring, unbalanced character focus, and the competent OST are issues, but the symbolic opening theme and the utter absurdity of the events highlight the anime\u2019s high degree of execution in many of its categories. Thinking about it now, this may be one prison worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, the diverse range of comedy, the purposeful sexual content, and the allegorical narrative create a well-rounded and well-executed experience\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, gross censoring, very nice camera work, imaginative artistic direction, both boring and inventive character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, the cast is designed with comedy in mind, and they represent inversion and friendship, but disproportionate attention hampers its relationship theme\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, a hilarious romp, soured only by Hana messing with Kiyoshi and Chiyo\u2019s romantic relationship\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

Now the anime itself is about a all-girls dorm school opening up for boys and when 5 new boys join it they see a new form of student council there and even get imprisoned in an in school prison for trying to peep in girls bath. The characters themselves are quite unique, a recluse, a big fluffy guy, an otaku, you get the idea. Its super funny and keeps the interest of the viewer all the time,with the attempts of the boys and the misunderstandings between them. The whole anime revolves around the boys attempts/efforts trying to get out of the prison. Super funny and I definitely recommend it for adult audience.",

            "content": "Writing from the point of view of a young adult male:\r\nWOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. I came across this show when I was running out of anime to watch (kind of fortunate given it was around exam period for me), and reading the review piqued my interest. I kept my eye on it and waited for all 12 episodes to be released, and boy am I glad I did.\r\nI appreciate what some would call immature humour, that is, sex jokes (or any related \"taboo\" subject). But that is not enough to make me enjoy a comedy, what really sets a joke is the context, and Prison Schoolhas done so masterfully, there is amazing situational comedy to be found in every episode. There are so many examples of this, but to truly gauge whether or not this is the show for you, watch no further than the 3rd episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not the kind of person to enjoy silly and cheeky sex jokes, then you should approach this anime with either caution or a sense of light-heartedness.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators of this story are so imaginative, some of the lines and explanations in the show are so completely stupid, yet somehow retain a sense of logic, which leads to some really memorable moments and great humour (e.g. the explanation of the evolution of breasts, and Kiyoshi's peeing stance).\\n\\n\r\nThere is but one complaint I do have about the show, yes, it is the ecchi. There is a ridiculous amount of boobage in this series, however, I managed to get over it for the sake of the comedy. If unnecessary cleavage and gratuitous up-skirt shots are a dealbreaker for you, then perhaps this anime is not for you, though I still recommend attempting to watch up to the 3rd episode; if you get that far and still do not appreciate the humour over your distaste for the ecchi, then you can honestly say that you did truly attempt to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nThough honestly, I have recommended and shown this anime to a total of 8 of my friends (so far), and every single one of them thoroughly enjoyed the show (even those completely against ecchi).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I found myself laughing so hard and having to hold my sides from the pain, it was that good. I would give it a 9/10 overall.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr\\n\r\nGreat comedy, though excess ecchi may turn some away.",

            "content": "Incredibly funny, un-apologetic fan service, gorgeous animation with characters to root for and plotted by a surprisingly good prison thriller. \r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \r\nMy surprise of the year. What I first thought to be trashy fan service shocked me in every way. The funniest anime I\u2019ve probably ever seen. Laughing out loud (literally) almost every episode. Characters that felt more real than most other shows. Fan service with animation quality and style I couldn\u2019t get enough of. I felt compelled to buy the manga after finishing the 12 episodes.\r\nI specified this review is for the dub because comedy is difficult to translate across cultures. That\u2019s why visualor physical humor is more popular than a clever pun. The dub team clearly knew the fucking gold they had on their hands and played it up. The character VA\u2019s sounded like a hentai dub but with effort. It was obvious the VA\u2019s were having fun. I saw an episode in sub and, while it\u2019s still good, it just doesn\u2019t have that impact unless you\u2019re a native moon speaker.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of hentai, the art style for the girls is fucking fantastic. Many times I just wanted to stop the video and unzip my pants. The tits, the ass, the proportions\u2014just destroys your crotch. The character designs are more realistic instead of that moeshit. They look like real fuckin\u2019 women. Not bug eyed little shits.\\n\\n\r\nOn being real, I gotta say it\u2019s fucking refreshing to see male characters act like real dudes. It\u2019s nice seeing guys being guys. Today you\u2019ve got one guy to ten girls because you gotta have self-insert harem. But not here. They\u2019re teenagers exploding with hormones, and they wanna see some T and A.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting in this show is more of a thriller than a show trying to be a thriller. I wanted these boys to get what they want. There\u2019s none of that slice o\u2019 life shit here. Every episode: something is fucking happening. You know what they want, you know what\u2019s going on, and you want them to get it.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn\u2019t believe that the writing here is actually good because there\u2019s one particular thing I noticed: when writing your character\u2019s plot, it\u2019s easy to let them succeed with much trouble. That\u2019s bad writing. It\u2019s your job as the creator to make trouble for your characters. That\u2019s interesting. Going from Point A to Point B is a snooze fest. But going from Point A to Z to X to K to B is what\u2019s exciting. The boys\u2019 plans were constantly being flipped at every turn making each episode intense.\\n\\n\r\nLook, this show isn\u2019t some paragon of comedy. The premise is silly. There\u2019s a whole scene dedicated to a poop joke. But if you hate on it because of that then fuck you and fuck your pretentious bullshit. Fun things are fun. I\u2019m praying to the gods there\u2019s a season 2.",

            "content": "Now, this one is a real surprise. When I first heard the name \"Prison School\" and saw a picture of 5 guys wearing prison clothes with the background being iron bars and boobs, I was expecting a bland ecchi comedy anime that is compiled of stand-alone episodes with no actual plot. Oh, how wrong I was...\r\nThis anime is a parody of every school anime out there that has a perverted male protagonist and a strong female lead. It basically showcases the worst-case-scenario that no one ever thought would ever make it to the storyboard, not to mention the screen. The show was hilarious, mocking everycliche in the book masterfully, but there was more to it than that; this show also managed to have suspense and drama. This anime taught me about freedom, willpower and true friendship while keeping me in suspense more than any anime could have done with the same amount of episodes. I never expected to be invested in this show so much.\\n\r\nThe characters were extremes, the guys were a lot more perverted and the girls much meaner and crueler towards them. However, while not meant to be relatable, you get invested in the characters as you see them fight together through thick and thin and become stronger. All characters have depth to them and cannot be described in few words. Each character have different aspects that are seen throughout the show in different situations and it gives you the feeling that there is more to them than meets the eye. You share the feelings of the characters on screen, even in the most absurd moments, making you excited as well as depressed with them without realising why.\\n\r\nThe story itself was unrealistic, but surprisingly good, touching and very funny. The ending, while being very satisfying, keeps you in suspense and has you wanting a second season. This anime was a very intense experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is amazing. It is very detailed and realistic, getting even more detailed at times for comedic or dramatic affect and getting quite creative during parts that have more sexual content.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the show perfectly and does a great job in adding to the show in terms of drama and suspense, both during the comedic moments and in more serious times, while not standing out too much.\\n\r\nThe voice actors also did an amazing job in conveying the characters' many different aspects and giving them alot of depth. Each voice fits the character's personality very well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now it's time to address the elephant in the room; the ecchi. This anime is not a typical ecchi. Here, sex is less of a major plot point and more of a recurring motif. It's simply there to bring out even further the absurdity of the situation.\\n\r\nThe sexuality in this anime is not a main part of the plot and it does not interrupt it, it just goes along with it. It is still an ecchi anime, so the show does over sexualize the characters, both male and female, but not on a regular basis (with the exception of one). If it bothers you too much, than don't force yourself and just don't watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is much more than it seems to be and I really enjoyed watching it. I highly recommend to anyone who's looking for a good ecchi anime to watch this one and for anyone who have their doubts about this show to give it a try.",

This show had me laughing and cringing every episode and is a fantastic ride through and through. Even the moments that aren't purposely funny they just are based on what the characters are doing and how they act. The premise of somehow a group of four boys somehow getting enrolled into an all girl school with a fascist style student council who throw the boys into a jail because boys were being pervy sets up for the comedy in such an absurd way. Raunch comedy isfor sure what I would label it but it's the absurdity of the comedy that always kept me rolling in laughter throughout the entire run of the anime.",

            "content": "\"This is why men are scum.\"\r\nUnapologetically lewd and undeniably enjoyable, Prison School is an anime I haven't seen for quite some time and was surprised to like it as much as I did.\r\nA top-selling ecchi in Japan, the premise is odd but simple: five boys have been unilaterally admitted into the stern girls-only Hachimitsu Academy. Since according to President Kurihara: \"all men are scum\", the five are caught peeping and are immediately banished to the prison section of the school for a punishment otherwise known as some seriously hardcore detention. Soon after, the Underground School council - made up of three arguably sadistic leaders, includingthe wonderful Meiko Shiraki - begin to put them to work relentlessly and deal out severe punishment when due...or not. \\n\\n\r\nI wasn't looking for an intelligently elaborate story when I began watching Prison School and I didn't get one, yet I still laughed myself silly and couldn't help but like the male characters, especially Gakuto. The personalities of the boys were endearing and at times bloody funny. I'm no stranger to particularly peverse anime but it's rare I find one that can genuinely make me laugh with its mix-ups and ridiculous scenarios (like poop.mp3). My only complaint was that I could've used more background stories from the girls themselves to explain how they ended up in their high-ranking positions (I'm assuming it wasn't just their athleticism or Miyagi-like karate skills).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it was a lot of fun and I loved it. And not just because of Meiko Shiraki's huge personalities.",

Whoa.\" \r\nIn the first attempts to watch the series, I fell short. Perhaps the obnoxious lens flair did that, however, after Kangoku Gakuen got a head of steam, the show rarely became dull. \r\nStripped from the manga of the same name is the unnecessary filler, mandatory beach, shopping or otherwise. From the start, our main cast of boys are introduced,Takehito Morokuzu serves as the strategist of the group, the instigator behind the madness, Kiyoshi Fujino, ourprotagonist whose only wish is to make it with a innocent school mate. Shingo Wakamoto whose a bit of a yankee character early on only to reveal as a plot twist later, Jouji Nezu a hooded introvert who coughs up blood and Andou Reiji whose face is dwarfed by the massive weight around his head. \\n\\n\r\nOur cast of merry men are students in an all girls school, possibly the only boys outside of the posterior loving head principal to make an appearance. Inspired as any group of teenagers to take advantage of a midnight peep show ends with the group being spotted when Kiyoshi ends up in the bath with his near sighted love interest. \\n\\n\r\nThe boys are publicly humiliated and held prisoner by the underground student council, an almost superhuman group of high school girls whom enforce the rules of the school and wish to see them expelled. \\n\\n\r\nA severe punishment aside, Prison School centers around two plots and an extremely tight story. As the manga counterpart is well past 100 chapters, this 12 episode (currently) series serves as a crisp story with a great deal of depth. Author Akira Hiramoto's style translates well in the crisp character detail, standing out with visually appeasing attire and wonderful sequences. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the pacing of the anime is good. Episodes progress the plot along rather well, although many may consider the reasoning 'why' and slap their heads in amazement to the level of audacity the boys will go to simply to escape despite the repercussions of such a feat.\\n\\n\r\nA fine detail was the cast of characters. While the girls of the underground student council are a varied cast of brutal prison staff whom abuse our gang both mentally and emotionally, the stand-out in this show is Meiko Shiraki. A tall amazon highschool student with a strong hatred for men and a strong history in BDSM. Patrolling the boys with a riding crop, short skirt and massive breasts, she hands out punishment that would cause Dorian Grey to blush. \\n\\n\r\nWith the interactions between characters tightly knit, there is little else to desire. We are introduced to the captors, the school and the 'rules'. The claustrophobic atmosphere soon emphasizes our sense that, while we may be observers to the boys harsh treatment, we very well are prisoners in the school along with them. \\n",

            "content": "I didnt expect to like Prison School. Glancing at the ads for it, I assumed it was another ecchi esque show that was strongly upvoted by the males for the sexual content but with no backbone and core story. But then I saw a poll of shows fans wanted of second seasons, and PS was one of the top three picks for the females. That got me interested enough to try, so I did. The initial episode left me a bit confused, as I found it funny but not a hugely deep plot. But the imprisonment kept me interested and the jokes were indeed funny.As I watched more episodes, it gradually hooked me more. \\n\\n\r\nThe jokes in this show come from serious thoughts and plans the main characters have, but these actions are taken to the extreme. A small scene where a character could need something as simple as, say, a water bottle could transpire into a huge cesspool, and I found the storywriting and characterization behind that very funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere is indeed fanservice, but I found it entertaining, and I enjoyed when the fanservice was addressed directly and tied to the actual plot. I find that a bit more tolerable that shows like, say, Grimgal this season where the characters are peeping on the women in the bath or talk about \"flat chests\" because I find that a lot more uninteresting and completely pointless. The way its done here is way more tasteful, sexy, and entertaining. I will say that it caters a bit more toward male audiences though (but it seems to still have a fair female fanbase as well as suggested by that poll mentioned earlier).\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesnt waste time with fluff, showing a lot of things happening and moving at a brisk pace. It doesnt introduce almost any new characters from the core cast giving the main male and female leads plenty of time to develop in different ways. You see the friendships of the good guys and the bad people too, and you see several interpersonal connections that are done well, as well as the loyalty and bonds between characters. Best of all, it doesnt have a bloated cast, as all the characters serve functions. Theres no ditzy girl stereotype just to fulfill character space and provide fanservice, no tsundere or moe character just for the sake of having them in the show, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThere were of course small nitpicks I didnt like, like some characters logics at times, but this was overshadowed just by how funny the jokes were. There were even unexpectedly emotional moments, and also there were moments where things from many episodes before would return, creating a strong sense of continuity. Overall very solid, and I recommend the manga too for any who liked the anime and want to continue further.",

Furthermore, since the anime is for mature audiences, the version I viewed contained mild censors from time to time. Also, prepare for excessive sweating from the characters and minor bloodshed, in a positive way.\r\nFor character development, I found the characters to be unique and enjoyable in their own way. The story will enable you to discover the likes anddislikes of the characters; their strengths as well as their weaknesses, which will be used as the boys and the girls plot against each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it was enjoyable narrative. Characters overtly scheme plans to obtain what their hearts desire. The plan is explained beforehand, but it is an adventure seeing whether or not the plan is a success or a failure in the end. \\n\\n\r\nI have taken a liking in this anime, it is quite hilarious and every episode has had me in laughs. There are a lot of sexual references tied in with the humor, but it only adds to the enjoyable nature of the anime.",

I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nPrison Schoolwas an anime I was really hesitant to watch due to a lot of the content I saw of it. It looked like a nudity-central anime with little plot and excessive ecchi. Though that may be true for the most part, I was still pleasantly surprised. Overall the anime is very funny, but manages to have an interesting and serious plot to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nStory(7/10)\\n\r\nThis isn't the strongest story I have ever seen, but it sure is good. Th concept is more or less original and well executed. It all comes together as a plan begins to unfold and it all becomes very exciting. Finding out the genius escape plans was really cool. I certainly thought it was a pretty unique story, and since it was well done, it deserves a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)\\n\r\nThis is certainly the strong point of the anime. The art is really new, and strange. At first it is a little bit annoying, but as things progress it grows on you. I really enjoyed the unique art style, and it was all wrapped up with smooth and detailed animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound(5/10)\\n\r\nLike the art was the strong point, this was the weak. Nothing ever really stood out as far as sound is concerned. Of course, when the sound seemed off it was either really goofy, or just unfitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nAll of the characters were very likable. Th all had good development, especially the main five, and none were too flat or cliche. I found that all of the characters against the protagonist were also likable, which is something I really enjoy seeing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nI thought this show was hilarious. With the right balance of comedy, tension, and ecchi, the anime was really fun to watch. At times I was laughing so much it hurt, and others I was holding my breath. It really came together better than you could expect.\\n\\n\r\nSo don't let assumptions put you off, like me. Yo just may be pleasantly surprised. I recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy, ecchi, or schemes. Anyone interested in prison breaks or mental games would most likely really enjoy this show. I would not recommend this to the faint of heart, as nudity, gore, and profane language is really frequent here. I also won't recommend this to anyone looking for action-heavy or philosophy-heavy anime.",

Then, a day later it was digged up again (da feels). And this character is loved so much, it even made a man cry. A few episodes later this character was buried again, under cement and stones behind the school(cries). And it was finally dead. Rest in peace lovely booty pictures.\r\nI would say it was an ok anime all in all. The characters were fun, as well as their design. \r\nAnd I like how women areshown in this anime, like.. very strong and dominant, with their own will. Even if, Meiko, Hana and Mari seem to be ultra feministic.  The humor gets worse every episode.  But the expressions of the characters are on fleek,I loved them. \\n\r\nI wouldn\u00b4t recommend this anime to everyone (((\u25cbU\u03c9U)\uff89\u201d\u266a\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nI loved the approach that was used in this anime to be honest. It was definitely different from the usual \"perv\" anime that are generally produced in the anime industry. Their use of \"serious moments\" combined with the obvious intent of being light hearted and plain run of the mill humour was a good step - ingenious in my opinion. And with that said, the arc which was covered in this anime was also really good, because the twists were actually covered well, and were balanced. Especially in terms of plot points, it kept me on my feet.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art suited the story. Without a singlechibi moment, and yet being able to integrate chibi into this \"quasi-serious\" scenario, is usually difficult to handled but they pulled it off and in style. The tension, combined with the paradoxes that were portrayed through the characters, was really good. I personally found it rad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was suited to the moment, was not so annoying to the ears - in fact, I'd say that the characters were voiced perfectly and according to their personalities - and likewise, the music suited the general ambiance of the anime. At the same time, the awkward moments, and the humorous moments, all were on cue - the art felt alive especially because the sound was spot on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have no comments here. That rating that I've given speaks for itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was hilarious, and it was sincere to its plot. Especially where the manga is concerned,  I'd say this anime deserves recognition. It's a masterpiece in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. It's hilarious. Plain hilarious.",

There proves to be no real difference between the two and in some aspects the anime proves to be superior to the manga at least for getting you through the first real arc. It's a great way to shave off tens of chapters with the same effect as having read them.\r\nThere's nothing really too horrible about the show  as a whole if you're a fan of the manga then it should be a joy to watch or if you're interested in the manga but unsureon whether it's within your taste then this will definitely sway you toward a decision. My only real gripe is the fact that due to censorship you're robbed of the real basic concept that makes Prison School so over the top as to its ecchi portions. But I mean what can you do it's part of the broadcasting law, plus gotta get something so the Blu-Rays will sell.\\n\\n\r\nBasically if you enjoy the manga then it's a good watch, but if you didn't enjoy the manga or don't enjoy a comedy with ecchi in it then there's really nothing here that's going to change your mind towards liking either. Hope for a possible season 2 in the future.",

Overall right now I'm just chuckling to myself thinking about the anime. Then why did I only give a 7?\r\nIt lacks balance as an anime. It had no key extraordinary points and in my view is just a brought down version of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun. The art, story and sound were nothingincredible. Quite incredible, but the characters were absolutely amazing. Hilarious and a joy to watch. But that on it's own will make it a great anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime does what it was meant for and it does it well.

            "content": "What do you think of first, when you hear \u201cPrison School\u201d? 0815 romance anime? Yet again a show about how friendship saves the world? No way in hell! This is one of the most hardcore ecchi comedy animes out there (proven by the amount of censorship) and a gem of the summer 2015 season.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story is pretty good, considering, that it's an ecchi anime. The boys enroll into an all-girls boarding school, and the first thing, you do, if you're surrounded by girls? Of course peeking! Not with those girls. As a result of their heroic deed they're put into prison, where a girlwith abnormal big breasts has to oversee them (typical fight fire with fire). Little do they know, how twisted the three girls of the Underground Student Council are.\\n\r\nYou see plot twists (or troll twists, however you want to see it), a better romance than in your everyday ecchi anime and most importantly no cliffhanger as ending. While it gives hints of a 2nd season, it concludes the story with a fine ending.\\n\r\nOne question however hasn't been resolved: Why is there a prison on a school campus and who approved of it?! Whatever...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nFitting to the screwed up story the characters are pretty \u201coriginal\u201d. A pervert worshiping ants? Check! An overweight pervert, who seems like somebody drew him wrong? Check! And it goes on. The story concentrates mainly on Kiyoshi, who seems to be the most normal character. But that doesn't mean that the other ones are underdeveloped nor that he is innocent. All in all an interesting and refreshing set of crazy, nice and pervert teenagers. And don't forget the cool chairman. He's the MVP of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe voices are perfect for the characters. Gakuto sounding like a mad scientist, the chairman like a boss. If you were in the anime, you couldn't differ, if their voices were real or not, because they fit. The opening and ending was nice, but nothing special. The soundtracks were on the same page. You hear them sometimes and it's nice to hear, but nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was on-spot. It makes every scene ridiculous and you're reminded of Great Teacher Onizuka or One Punch Man (they use a similar style). The sweat isn't that sweet though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs you could point out by the other aspects, I thoroughly enjoyed Prison School. The scenes are ridiculous. The ecchi is used for trolling reasons, especially as for the vice-president. They include deep sayings and famous battles in history to make fun of some situations. Besides, it's not a generic anime (finally). It's like they tried out everything and it worked out. I'm glad that there are still manga authors out there who stray from the most common concept of ecchi [+ harem] and try to create memorable mangas.\\n\r\nFurthermore, their plans to break out are quite funny and interesting. That goes so far that you're excited about knowing whether they will succeed or not.\\n\r\nBut I'm just able to give a 9 because I'm still an opponent of too much and too extreme ecchi, even, if it's used for comedy reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10\\n\r\nEven, if I rate it with such a good score, consider watching it twice! Its ecchi is pretty extreme, thus it's not for everyone. If you survive the first episode, then grab your popcorn and enjoy the anime to the fullest extent!",

Prison School is a show about utter determination to never give up even when all hope seems gone, with the right allies anything can be accomplished!\r\nOn a more serious note, this is an ecchi, a very strong themed ecchi. This could be your only minor set-back to enjoying thisshow. If you feel this way after viewing the first few episodes, think of it like this:\\n\r\n The atmosphere of the show is indeed dark, perhaps even dismal, the array of disgusting scenes you will endure provokes that atmosphere. If you are repelled, it's working; you are not supposed to adorn the antagonists - their personalities are sociopathic. Based on the dark ecchi themes you will be revolted by their personas, actions, and train of thought(s). This is why the ecchi in Prison School works.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is outstanding and far from meta.\\n\\n\r\nPrison School is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nBuy the hell out of it.\\n\r\nThen buy another copy for your girlfriend. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a prime example of how the sheer nonsense can be a worthwhile product. But all that the author did was just bringing all that nonsense (which the anime is overflowed with) to the absurd, at the same time making sure that main lines of the plot remained within borders of adequacy. The intensity of the absurd and the atmosphere of this anime is not for everybody. This absurd comedy will unlikely be popular among a wide audience. But, I think that the older audience can appreciate all power of this work. \r\nIn fact, Prison School tells about ordinary things in amodern anime: friendship, partnership and of course romance. But the main thing lurks in the absurdity of the anime. Exactly all this nonsense vividly satirizes the anime industry flooded with boobs shaking. This epic absurd paced like a roller on all Ecchi at once, and not only Ecchi. Sports and Slice Of Life were also affected. Only that legendary armwrestling battle between the guys and Meiko costs much (not to mention more). Moreover, the banter of the anime went through contradictions of Japanese society in matters of sex. After all, the fact that protagonists were declared criminals and jailed for peeping is not inherently absurd for Japan. \\n\\n\r\nNo, I'm not going to cry about the genius and the blame of the season. I personally had a lack of lots of things. Had a lack of fun, surprisingly. Had a lack of funny jokes. It was fun but there was a lack of precisely funny jokes. Not enough lasting action, because the overall pace of the narrative is not so high. Anyway the thing stays worthwile with the unpredictable and (unexpectedly) not squeezed final. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you do not usually turn away from the genre \"comedy of the absurd\", than you probably should watch Prison School.",

But only five boys are accepted and long story short they commit a crime (peeping girls during their bath) and sended in the school prison.\r\nThe story starts already at full speed. The five boys get straight to the point and decide to go peeping girls. They get caught and here begin the story. This anime is a mega climax, and it starts raising at the very beginning.And the awesome point is that the anime KEEP THIS PACE! The climax doesn't stop at any time at all till the end! And even the end is a super climax! That's very rare in modern animes...\\n\r\nArt and sound are superbe. Specially the art. It's well made and it gets the spectator to a deep level. \\n\r\nCharacters... they are... i don't know, but they are close to perfection. The feeling that they transmit, the thoughts that they have, the way that they act, the development during the anime... From the start to the end, they go through problems, riddles, CHALLENGES and many others things that made me think a lot.\\n\r\nAt last but not least, enjoyment. It was quite normal. For an ecchi and a seinen, seeing panties, bras, sweat all over the places, bad words, bad thoughts, twisted thoughts wasn't bad at all. A seinen is for 18+, and so i enjoyed the mature humor and all of its consequencies. \\n\r\nSo, i enjoyed a lot Prison School and it gave me more than one moment to think that sometimes the world can be really twisted (because what happens in the anime could certainly happen in real life, and trust me, i had more than one experience of similar situatuons...).\\n\r\nDon't miss it, because this anime is funny, twisted, and full of strange things but it's emjoyable and the characters are pure genius. 8/10",

            "content": "Metabolism juices and borderline hentai with fucking fantastic writing?! - Prison School review\r\nPrison School is a show with some of the best writing and direction I\u2019ve seen in recent time. Nothing in the story happens by accident, for everything in Prison School happens for a reason. Before long, Hachimitsu academy was an all girls private academy until recently it followed up with open enrollment for boys. And those boys are the slick and wicked main characters of the series: Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Andre, and Shingo. We watch as they commit a crime of peeping in the girl\u2019s bathroom earning themselves time in the school prison.We are brought right into the action, no stalling and no stagnated scenes, where the story quickly gathers center around the boys in the prison.\\n\\n\r\nNot in a long time have I seen such great writing in an anime alongside Shokugeki. From the moment Gakuto mentions the Three Kingdoms and Guan Yu, it all plays out in the breakout arc. Or when Kiyoshi finds Hanna doing her business in the school forest that of which plays a pivotal role in the entire show. There is such a brilliance of connecting ideas that means something, and not just for the sake of it. It handles immature things maturely, if that makes any sense. For one thing that plays out, it leads to another and ultimately leads to the awesome ending that we fans deserve to witness. Not one concept is thrown out of the window left to be discarded in the burial at sea. The comedy is a sure fire of laughter and re-watchable. Whether it ranges from sexual to violence, while also being serious, it handles all of it very well executed and shows the underlying messages of the series such as honor, redeem-ability, morals etc. which is prevalent within all of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe five boys each have their own unique character traits. Kiyoshi may seem like your generic nice guy, however he has this loving heart and honesty to him greater conveying his convictions. What makes him a better character is the sequences that he puts himself through. Anyone can nitpick and point out \u201che\u2019s a generic character\u201d but why? Kiyoshi in the show proves with his actions that he is his own, he steers the show in the critical direction that it truly earns. Gakuto is the brains of the group yet he is so much more. His love for the Three Kingdoms plays out fundamentally strong in the breakout arc. From here, we see him show with his intellect that he can be both comical and suave. Much more when he defecates himself to proceed with their plans of escape with no single regret. Joe is like the Kenny (South Park) of Prison School. His love for ants make him quite distinct and it plays a major role in the DTO arc. He is a bro that forgave Kiyoshi after preventing him from harming the president in reaction to him assuming the crows were eating his ants. Andre is the tank of the group. His masochistic nature to get brutalized by the vice-president offers hilarious scenes, like him licking her saliva off his face. His design is unique and is someone I\u2019d hang out with. Lastly, Shingo\u2019s role is hilarious to mistaken the actions of Gakuto and Kiyoshi during their breakout planning. Spreading rumors to Joe and Andre, they grow suspicious of the two of them. Eventually he is seduced by Meiko to become a rat. From there it plays out in the end that you should always have your bro\u2019s back, no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nEver since the underground student council made their first appearance, they were already distrustful from the start, and making it even stronger is Mari\u2019s hate towards men because of her father, the principal\u2019s hobbies in women. By no means are they dislikeable characters, as the audience, we understand who they are and whatever reason caused it. Meiko \u2018disciplines\u2019 the boys but only for it to be taken advantage of. But of course, her metabolism juices are disgustingly enjoyable. Hanna is tough on the outside, but on the inside she is just a child who knows nothing. Her character development is really strong as she gets more and more violent and emotional because of the events that happen between her and Kiyoshi. And it is all the more enjoyable because they are such great characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show goes for a more realistic approach, sort of. With the unique coloring and atmosphere given life into the world of Prison School, it all the more immerses the violence and sexual content by breathing realism. Brutalities done in by Hanna to the boys feel impact and invigorating. It is all consistent along with the great animation. I did not notice one derpy scene in the production of the show. Sound offers enticing and arousing elements. It conveys the scenes of Meiko punishing the boys, Hanna beating the shit out of the boys, or the boys doing their crazy stuff all very phenomenal. Voice acting is just really good. It fits well with the cast and they voice act appropriately and insightful throughout the show. Opening and ending portray the the series anime or manga, perfectly. I can\u2019t see it any of other way.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know how to contain my pleasure of watching Prison School, and that is why it earns high score of 9/10 with a juicy and masochistic seal of approval. Of all the shows out there, this one is definitely a contender for the best of 2015. It offers mature writing and direction, well executed characters, and a satisfying narrative. I nod Prison School for giving me such a wonder and I hope that it comes back for a season 2. I\u2019ll be on my way now.",

            "content": "Prison School is absolutely hilarious. This 'ecchi-filled' anime will constantly have you at the edge of your seat with the amount of suspense put in. From time to time there will be nice scenes to fuel your imagination and a hint of adult themes.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAs you can tell from the synopsis, it's about a a group of guys who make it to an all girl's boarding school. While watching this i found it unpredictable at times which i like. Who likes an anime where they can easily predict what will happen next? It's just full of suspense which makes it so interesting to watch, youcan't take your eyes off it. Ever watched something so awkward you wanna scrunch up into a tiny ball? This anime will give a similar feeling.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is simply amazing, i love anime which have such nice visuals. Prison School never fail to make me laugh with the funny faces and expressions they make. Facial expression is so powerful, just by looking at it you can tell exactly how they feel. I noticed they put as much effort into the background as the foreground. Most anime generalize the background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is up for debate but, i didn't really like the opening song and ending song. However, the soundtracks and sound effects used in scenes building up tension are almost perfect. The voice actors are really good at bringing the characters to life because, they have so much feelings when they speak.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nNow this is where i believe Prison School really shines. If we just look at the group of 5 boys they are all unique in their own way. They done an amazing job in revealing each of their personalities within one episode. It wasn't even directly introducing them one by one but, we would gather hints just by watching the show. Genius, just genius.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOkay, i'm probably going to be abit bias by saying this. But, i am a sucker for ecchi anime. So this anime was just my cup of tea. The way the show teases you and sparks your imagination. To top it off, i like tsunderes so this show was like my dream anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nTowards the middle it can kinda feel slow paced and dragging on abit but, this show is incredible. If you like ecchi and comedy, then you know the drill.",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nArt: 7\r\nSound: 9\r\nCharacter: 8\r\nEnjoyment: 9\r\nOverall: 8\r\nI'm writing this right after finishing the last episode, so I can assure you that it's all still fresh in my mind. I started this series after a recommendation from a friend. Originally, I only intended to watch the intro to get a feel for it before going to bed. I ended up watching the first two episodes before falling asleep. When I woke up, I watched the third. And then, when I got home, I binged my way through the rest of them. I don't make a habit of finishing series in the space of 24 hours, butwith this show... I don't know what it is. It's crude, we see a panty shot in the first thirty seconds (and that's not the worst of it) and the five male characters are perverts, but it's strangely entertaining. I'm not a fan of ecchi or anything of the sort, but it's the way that this show is able to use fanservice as its strength. Without the fanservice, it wouldn't be quite as hilarious as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice appears to such an exorbitant amount that it's hilarious. Not to mention, with the exaggerated personalities of the characters, Prison School somehow manages to make it work. There's a guy who's obsessed with ants and coughs up blood due to canker sores, a guy who's obsessed with The Three Kingdoms and historical wars, a guy who's the literal dictionary definition of 'masochist', a guy that I don't even know how to CLASS and then there's our MC, Kiyoshi. The three main USC (Underground School Council) characters are quite a sight to behold too. There's Hana, the strange blonde with a pee fetish (honestly, I wasn't too much of a fan of those scenes) Meiko, the voluptuous sadist who could be said to be the strongest character in the entire series and Mari, the \"crow user\". All of these different characters put together, along with the addition of a few quirky others, makes for a strangely interesting show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is what really intrigued me. With the amount of fanservice in this show, it's impossible to imagine that there could be a coherent plot behind it. However, Prison School does exactly that: it crafts an intricate plot while simultaneously employing the use of fanservice. If anything, I kind of grew immune to the fanservice after the first few episodes. In Prison School, the five boys are caught peeping and are therefore sentenced to a month in prison, hence the title 'Prison School'. The story revolves around them trying to escape, and in the midst, proving their innocence for the further crimes that they are accused of. Our history-obsessed guy, who I'll refer to as \"yours truly\" (honestly, I can't even remember his name. I only remember them calling him \"filthy four-eyes\" and the \"yours truly guy\" so I'll go with that) is the mastermind behind many of their plans and does many heroic things in order to save his comrades, such as defecating himself in a class full of girls and letting Kiyoshi stab him in the forehead with a fork. He even breaks his limited edition figures just to save everyone else from further punishment. While there isn't much 'character development' (I mean, the boys are just as perverted at the end as they were at the start) there's only twelve episodes so it would be fairly tough to squeeze in any character development. We get to see some interesting planning, unexpected plot progressions, some hilarious jokes and (if you're into it) fanservice. I can't really explain the story, even with it all fresh in my mind. It's something you have to watch for yourself to truly understand.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it's surprisingly... detailed. I don't really have much to say about it. I really liked the visuals in the OP, though. I'll speak more about the OP in my next paragraph. The character designs are also suited to their characters; it's easy to differentiate between all the different characters. I didn't notice any problems with the art. In fact, one particular scene comes to mind where [slight spoiler] Meiko is holding a vibrating object in her hand and it's blurred so that the audience thinks that it's a sex toy, only to find out in the next episode that it's actually just a razor. [spoiler over.] I found that hilarious. The show was creative with its use of art in its own way, and I feel like I have to give it credit for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was something I really enjoyed. The songs for both the OP and the ED are amazing. I loved both of them (although I love the OP just a little bit more) and I never skipped either of them while watching this show. The OP is incredibly catchy (I have it stuck in my head as I'm typing this) and the music also goes with the visuals given in the OP. They used the soundtrack effectively during the show itself, using it to show changes of mood and to alert the audience that something was about to go down. 9 might seem a little high, I know, but I'd have to say that the Prison School OP would make it into my top 5 (and if not that, then my top 10). It's an amazing OP, and that alone garners a score of 9. The voice actors did a really good job as well. Hana's VA did a commendable job as well, being able to sound gentle one minute and ravenous the next. She embodied Hana's temperamental mood perfectly. Not to mention, the VA for \"yours truly\" did a really good job as well. Also, one more thing, it was SO NICE not to have to hear the typical anime girl voice (you all know what I'm talking about) and there was actual variety in the female voices rather than every female character speaking with that same squeaky \"K-K-Kiyoshi-kun?\" voice complete with jiggling breasts and flushed cheeks. There was variety, and the VAs were very well suited to their roles. Because of the above reasons, I have no complaints about the sound whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said in above paragraphs, I liked the variety of characters that the show had to offer, and for that I gave the rating of 8. Some might disagree with this rating, but it's my personal opinion. The female characters in particular were fairly interesting to watch (my personal favourite is Chiyo, since she's such a loyal and adorable character. It really got me how she was willing to face expulsion just to defend Kiyoshi, and it really established her as an important character in the show).\\n\\n\r\nI rated my enjoyment a 9 due to the fact that I couldn't stop laughing at all the random parts that came up. Sometimes there were panty shots that were so UNNECESSARY that I couldn't help but start laughing, and to be honest, I think that's what the show wanted. It kind of makes fun of itself, and a show that can make fun of itself is a show that has the potential to succeed. Prison School doesn't try to take itself seriously (which is a mistake that many other anime shows have made) but it instead pokes fun at itself and exaggerates itself to the max, therefore making the viewing experience even more enjoyable. Even the speech patterns of some characters were funny, like the Chairman. On the last word of every sentence, they make his facial expression more intense and have him pause before he speaks. I don't know why, but it made me laugh. (Oh, the Chairman really is a great character. I'm not going to say everything he does here, but he's actually hilarious.)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, there were some bits that made me uncomfortable. The Hana and Kiyoshi scenes made me cringe a bit. To sum it up for those who haven't watched, Hana tries to force Kiyoshi to pee in front of her on more than one occasion, forces him to undress and then gets mad at him for peeing on her/getting a boner/being resistant. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact that their scenes were nearly always cut short by someone interrupting, the 'Enjoyment' score would be even lower than 9. It was probably meant to be funny that Hana wanted to see Kiyoshi pee, but I really couldn't find it funny. It made me so uncomfortable to watch them on screen together. Plus, I just hated Hana as a character in general. I wish she'd gotten less screen time. This didn't dampen my viewing experience too much, although it prevented me from giving my enjoyment a perfect 10. (I personally wish they'd left the 'pee fetish' out of the show, but maybe people enjoy that? I don't know. I didn't.) I also wasn't too much of a a fan of Andre (the masochist). He seemed like a really insignificant character compared to the other four boys. The other four left an impression on me, but Andre... I only remember him as the most perverted guy in the group. As far as I'm concerned, he had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They could've gotten rid of Andre completely and I wouldn't have noticed. Even the CROWS played a bigger part in the show than he did and the crows can't even speak, for God's sake. Perhaps he'll get a bigger role in Season 2 if there ever is one, but until proven otherwise, his character's redundant.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, considering that this was all done in twelve episodes, Prison School did an outstanding job. It didn't feel rushed at any stage--in fact, Prison School sets its own pace and it WORKS--and if anything, twelve episodes was perfect for this little season. (Then again, I wouldn't complain if they decided to release more episodes.) If you're trying to decide whether to watch this or not, just go and watch the first episode right now. When it comes to 'Prison School', it's either a hit or miss. If you're fairly new to anime, I don't think I'd recommend Prison School (mainly because some of the stuff and angles depicted are the kind that you'd only see in hentai) but if you've been watching anime for a while, then go ahead and take a dive into the world of Prison School. You won't regret it.\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I avoided this thing with a ten foot pole because of the cover art. High school ecchi's aren't my cup of tea unless they have something setting them far apart from the masses, and oh boy does this set itself apart. I pulled an all nighter because I couldn't find myself stopping. \r\nFive perverted boys find themselves at a used to be all girls school. Why are they the only boys with two hundred girls you might ask? Don't worry about it. Why does no one expect them to be perverts and go look in the girl's bathroom? Not really sure. Whyis there just a full decked prison in the school courtyard? Don't question it. The story turns into one thing and then into another, and I found it to be hilariously enjoyable from the second it started.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absurd ( in the good way). Its over the top and dramatic with almost every frame and it works so well with the style and tone of the show. The ecchi is over the top, the facial expressions are over the top, heck, even some of the backgrounds are over the top. It works. \\n\\n\r\nThis is hard because I own this and watched both sub and dub. The sub is alright, but the dub is amazing. The dub adds more crudeness and humor to the show. Like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt and Ghost Stories,this one deserves to be watched as a dub. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hilarious. End of story. From the boys to the Underground Student Council to the Above Ground Student Council to the girls in the school to even the principal. Each one of them are so different but they all work so well. \\n\\n\r\nLike I stated at first, I refused to even go near this thing. I found myself finishing it in the span of a night because I literally couldn't close my laptop after episodes ended. Prison School is a short lived over the top ecchi that deserves the hype it gets (this thing is super popular in Japan) because of the antics, characters, and art style. For the love of all things holy watch this one with the door closed and headphones in. \\n\\n\r\nAs of the end of the manga coming forth, please go see my review of the Prison School Manga because oh boy its really different.",

            "content": "Ahh, Prison School. I really loved this anime, and I really wanted to give it an 8, but my policy is to deduct 1 score from anything that isn't finished, and this anime really needs a season two.\r\nStory:\r\nIf people ever ask me what Prison School is like, I say it's an anime American Pie. The story here is probably on the weaker side, however I can only speak for the 12 episodes we've been given so far. The basic premise is that five guys get transferred to a previously all girl school as a test. After they get caught peeping in the girls shower, theyget thrown in the school prison. I won't fault the show for having a ridiculous premise like that, as I've seen way stranger by now. All of that happens in the first two episodes, and the rest of the series is focused on the boys attempts at escape and run ins with the sexy school council members who run the prison. The characters and situations they get into on an episodic base really make up for the overall weak story. The ending isn't very satisfying, but they did at least manage to make it somewhat bearable (unlike Deadman Wonderland). \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nSince it's a generally slow moving show, there aren't a lot of fast paced action scenes to grade the show on. However, all the nice titty shots and innuendo scenes were done extremely well, with the white light filter leaving just enough to the imagination. Also, some of the still shots of Gakuto's face had me in stitches at times. Overall, the art is on the higher quality side of things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds in the show were definitely the weakest point, however the music wasn't a detrimental part of the show (ie action scenes to accentuate, etc.) so the lack of memorable music didn't feel like it hurt the show at all. I really do like the opening theme though, it's very catchy!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show stands out. The character interactions on this show easily had me laughing at multiple times throughout each episode, all the while reminding me of stuff like American Pie and Van Wilder. The character Gakuto is just something else entirely, he's easily the funniest characer on the show. The main character Kyoshi is a little stale at times, but the four others around him have enough personality to keep everything going). As for the student council members, Hana is easily my favorite. All her cringey encounters with Kyoshi were all most too much at times (in a good way).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nThis series is a perfect example of not needing a pro story to be good. This story stands well as an Ecchi piece and, as I've said a few times now, feels like you're watching an anime American Pie.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Prison School, and I want to score it an 8, but I just can't considering it's technically an incomplete anime. I know they attempted an ending, but it wasn't so great. This anime is great at parties and when you're alone at night with a bottle of whiskey. Toodles gents!",

It was recommended to me by a colleague, and it was quite enjoying!\r\nStory: 8.5/10\r\nThe story has quite the shock humour implemented into each scene. Due to the crude remarks and details put into each episode. It falls short as I felt the anime possesses an over-required sense of combustion. The story unfolds and soon after just kind of drags on. I subjectively believe that this could have been in the formation of a movie instead of a short anime series. I just honestly felt it had unnecessaryparts...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe art was unquestionably well-developed and depending on the viewer could transmit a positive or negative impact. Personally, I feel that the art was remarkably phenomenal and even though the explicit content could have been a bit too much from time to time, this seemed like it was the theme for the anime and the art unmistakably suited the general synopsis of the story. The well-formed artwork of each episode helps keep the viewer engaged in times when things may seem dull.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe sound wasn't anything extraordinary, although for the question; it wasn't awful either. The opening/ending music is pretty bland; they can be put into comparison to any other general anime theme song. The sound effects and voiceovers (English-dubbed) implemented were significantly done and helped the tone of the art. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe characters of the story were exceptional, and I would honestly give this over ten if plausible. The five boys are already very interesting characters whom each hold their personalities which makes the anime appealing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe anime is very enjoyable and depending on your particular comedic sense; It is guaranteed you cannot stop watching 'Prison School'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\\n\r\nAs one of the first animes I have completed, this has definitely given me a positive view on anime and I would recommend Prison School to almost anyone.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful and enjoy the anime!",

            "content": "Prison School. What. A. Show.\r\nTo preface this, I didn't read the manga. I don't read manga I just watch anime. I do read the discussions on r/anime though and this show has gotten a lot of praise for following the manga so closely with insane attention to detail and important scenes.Each episode is a masterfully orchestrated piece that ends on the most intense of cliffhangers only to be bested by the next episode.\r\nReally though. Right from the start it's really engaging and sets a silly/serious tone that just feels right throughout the entire process of watching. I'm not good at summarizing things very well, soif you want to know what the show is about then you should read some other reviews and/or the description on the MAL page. The concept will sound really odd and maybe even stupid at first but once you take your seat on this wild ride you'll never want to get off.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it's very impressive but since I haven't seen the Blu-ray/DVD stuff yet, the censorship is very brutal and overbearing in some places. The style is wonderful, but some of the parts where it zooms in on a character are a little odd. \\n\\n\r\nThe MUSIC is super intense and really sets a good stage for everything to play out. It has romantic music, silly music, super intense stuff and sometimes the show will switch it around so quickly you don't even know what hits you, but it works. Some of the sounds are little uncomfortable though like when the Vice Prez sweats a lot (sounds like tentacle hentai).\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's are wonderfully developed and have a great presence throughout the show and are easily likable. Even the supporting characters are developed enough to just love and laugh at, and they all have their awesome/funny quirks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I had one of the best experiences I've ever had while watching anime with this show. It's so funny and crazy that I just can't help myself. Keep in mind that it is very mature and has very mature humor as well. Make sure to watch this alone if you do!",

            "content": "Prison School, based of a popular manga, takes us to a familiar setting: The prestigious Hachimitsu Academy, a formerly all-girls high school opens its gates-for the first time- to 5 male students. The boys are excited to spent their high-school years surrounded by girls but the student council wants desperately to expel them, hating all boys in typical anime fashion.\r\n\tAfter a peeping scheme by the boys goes wrong, the powerful student council sentences them to prison. Literally. In the middle of the courtyard is a building clad in iron barred windows. And thus perversity, insanity and hilarity ensues. \r\n\tThis is a very funny anime. Ifyou don`t mind crude jokes and toilet humor. There is a lot fan-service included but it is not an ecchi anime. The fan-service is used as a mean to deliver the jokes and the insanity and not simply to arouse the average teenage viewer. Having said that, there are a lot of fetishes included and scenes that seem to have no other purpose other than advancing the general feeling of wackines and vulgarity. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe premise continues to build in its initial insanity, the boys becoming desperate in their prison, concocting far-fetched schemes to deal with the increasingly sadistic and hateful student council girls. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe visual style is slightly unorthodox: the character designs appear a little more realistic than usual which accentuates the eroticism at certain scenes (and the absurdity on others). Generally a top production work from the experienced J.C.Staff animation studio.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe ending is pretty satisfying for a 12-episode series. For those who liked the anime, it covers the first 81 chapters of the manga. The manga is still ongoing at the time of this writing and has published 197 chapters.\\n\\n\r\n\tConcluding, if you like vulgar humor you will enjoy Prison school and laugh throughout its 12 episodes. You may get annoyed at how evil the council girls are or how ridiculous the premise is, but it will be a fun ride. 7.5/10.",

Now what defines comedy.....me.\r\nPrison school is one of the most enjoyable,  hilarious ecchi's I have seen since in my entire divine existence. \r\nReview:\r\nThe story behind this show is that there are 5 functional members of society  as they get accepted into an all girl's boarding school. One night they decide to sneak into the girls change room and take pics of the girls changing, they get caught and are sent to the prison inside the school. Done. \r\nOverall my score is a 9/10.

            "content": "Prison School, is a school based ecchi anime that released in Summer 2015. \r\nStory (7): The premise of the Prison School evokes the tale of the protagonist Kiyoshi Fujino, and his classmates Andre, Joe, Gakuto, and Shingo as they embark on their first semester at the illustrious Hachimitsu Private Academy. The school was once an all-girls boarding school, but with the revision of the school\u2019s policy due to a new director, 5 boys were introduced onto the campus. During the first episode, the boys are surrounded by girls, and planned to go peeping on the girls as they showered, yet to their dismay they werecaught and sentenced to the aforementioned Prison School. The interesting aspect to Prison School, is that unlike other ecchi series, it puts the fan service and comedy towards the progression and development of the story. Certain events that rapidly progress the series forward are direct influences from ecchi or fan service moments, and reoccurring plotlines are extensions of previous fan service laced moments. While the story is not the most engaging, the humor certainly paid an effect on the development of the series and certainly does well. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8): The art style has a strong sense of variety and style, with crisp animation, and a certain gloss to it at times. The overreacting shots surely make the series stand out with many over the top situations and reactions to events bring out the art style and design of the characters in their development at Hachimitsu Academy. The character designs are certainly well done and with the production of the anime being J.C. Staff, the animators behind Bakuman, Shokugeki no Souma, and Toradora!, the art quality certainly is worthy of the pedigree. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8): The music used certainly had a great effect on the condition and the quality of the scenes in the series. The OST did a tremendous job of amplifying the emotions and tone of the setting during the course of the story. The Opening and Ending theme songs also bear a similar quality, with an addicting opening theme song featuring lyrics of the eponymous show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) While other series offer fan service and ecchi scenes as a means to coerce their audience, Prison School does a tremendous job of amplifying the ecchi into the development of their characters. All of the characters in Prison School show signs of insecurities and lacking aspects of the character as the series begins, as all of them start as stereotyped aspects of a typical teenager. Gakuto is initially a closet otaku who obsesses over Chinese tales and the Warring States, Joe is a quiet loner who enjoys being alone with his ant farm, Kiyoshi appears to be the most stable of the group, but is having issues on knowing what to do and how to find his place, Andre has a keen obsession on being punished, and Shingo has leadership qualities but does not know where his allegiances lie. The characters certainly change as the series progresses, and all of them had likable qualities by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): Prison School was an excellent school based ecchi anime, that leads its fanservicing moments towards the actual development of the series. Not only do the boobs jiggle, or the booty clap, but in doing so has a clear influence on the developments of the characters and the progression of the series. The humor of the series was certainly on point, with many aspects of the humor being absolutely hilarious at times. A great mold of story influenced ecchi, fantastic humor and gags as well as well done character development with crisp animation and sound design, I\u2019d happily recommend Prison School towards anyone wanting to watch an ecchi based humor anime in a school setting, as well as fans of the similar series: Shimoneta.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n",

            "content": "So I was in the mood for a new series and one that didn't recently come out. So I went to my trusty anime provider, brought up the dubs list (because if I am going to be diving into a complex plot or one that melts my brain, I at least want to still follow what is happening when my eyes roll backwards.), and playd Russian Roulette to determine what to watch. \r\nIt just so happened to land on Prison School. Now I have a rule that says that any show that doesn't entertain by episode 3 is a drop anime. Prison School almost fellinto that category. I read the summary before starting and was interested but upon start it didn't deliver much. So Prison School is best described as an Ecchi Comedy. Now the Ecchi is \"there\" from the word go, but the comedy actually takes backseat for a few episodes. Thusly the comedy is what saved this show for me. So let us go on this adventure of a review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nThe story in Prison School is what I would call an Idiot Plot. If you are unfamiliar or can't decode the meaning off name alone, an idiot plot is a plot that is only made possible by stupid people doing obviously stupid things. Some can be good idiot plots by having the characters seek out the solution to the problem they created and growth happens along the way so that if the characters were in the same situation again there would definitely be a different outcome.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Prison School falls on the other side of idiot plots where the characters screw up and spend there time living through their consequences not learning much along the way. Again the comedy is what kept me invested for the most part. I went out and read the manga (for a number of reasons) and found that the plot actually picks up a lot better in the later arc so there is that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNot much to this, the design is enjoyable to look at, there were a few times where the facial expression threw me off for a few moments but over all well done. One thing that did bug me was how they did the ecchi and why I put 'there' in parentheses. The show has no problem panning over or having the camera angle in such a way that the lewd view was VERY noticeable but at the same time they covered a lot of it up with light beams. So it became a consistent nag of watching a full scene, switch to half a scene since the other half is light beams, then go back to full. The manga obviously doesn't do this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nMuch like Art, there isn't much to say about sound. I didn't notice any nice tracks that play in the background. The Op and Ed were good but not memorable. The voice actors did well in bringing out the character of each character. Like I said, not much to say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nOk so while the voice actors did well in bringing out character. that still didn't do any favors for the lack of character these guys have. Remember, I said this is an idiot plot so not much growth happens here. The lead only gains some confidence while also still being a whining bitch. His pals consist of a whining bitch that is also smart, a whining bitch who is also a pussy, a masochist who is only that, and an ant lover who has a stomach disease. None of them grow or change. There were two characters who I found interesting and was also part of the reason I went back to read the manga. Hana and the Chairman. Hana is a treat to watch her play nice while instantly flipping shit when she gets mad while at the same time trying to get revenge (and more) on the lead. Its actually funny to watch and I was cheering her on the whole time. The Chairman is just an Ass addict who empathizes the last word or sound in every sentence he says. Kinda funny to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAs it stands I probably wouldn't go back to Prison school for a second run. The plot is really dumb, the characters are pretty bland (aside from 2), and sound is just forgettable. I remember asking myself at one point, \"If I left now would I regret it?\", to which my brain said \"No, but it wouldn't kill ya to finish it.\" And that's pretty much how it was for me. At the end of the day the comedy and a couple characters saved it for me. I would honestly read the manga if you are at all interested because at least you get more of it. I can give a firm guess there will not be a season 2 so might as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6    \\n",

            "content": "What is Prison School exactly? Is it an Ecchi? Harem? Hentai? Romance? Nope! Prison School, at its core, is a bromance comedy with tons of hilarious sexual humor. The comedy is first-rate and this is probably the funniest anime I have ever watched. The humor was raunchy, the timing was spot on, the characters were bizarre and uncomfortable. It was great.\r\nThe plot can be summed up in a few lines. After a foiled attempt at peeping on the girls\u2019 shower room, the five male students at an all-girls high school are sentenced to serve a month in the on-campus prison which is run by thetyrannical and estrogenic \u201cUnderground Student Council\u201d. The series takes us through the boys\u2019 absurd, demeaning and hilarious trials and tribulations of Prison School Life. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s immediately noticeable about Prison School is how blatantly unsexy the series is. For all the obscene physicality--the tits and ass--there is a marked lack of either sexual gratification or tension between the characters. It\u2019s more than just an icy, Fem-Dom thing too\u2014the female characters were almost completely asexual in terms of personality and response to their surroundings (I\u2019ll come back to that later). The only sexual tension occurs between Hana, the sadistic student council secretary, and Kiyoshi, the hapless protagonist, but their bizarre and absurd interactions are skillfully engineered to make you laugh, not fap. As a caveat, I should mention that there is going to be a subset of people who genuinely find the concept of scantily clad women beating the shit out of male anime characters more erotic than comical, but I will leave it up to the viewer to decide which category they belong in. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard critiques that Prison School objectifies women but it\u2019s hard to know which gender gets it worse\u2014which makes it hilarious. On one hand, the women in the series are all sexually objectified up the wazoo. T&A abound to a gratuitous degree. Some characters get more screen time for their boobs than their face. Equally unflattering for the ladies is the ultra-prudish attitude of the all-female Underground Student Counsel and the bland naivety of every other female cast member. They are unreasonable, humorless, reactionary, sadistic and domineering. \\n\\n\r\nNow on to the guys. The male characters are essentially hormone-driven, loser sex slaves---they are confined, beaten and humiliated daily. But this is O.K. because they are resilient guys who take everything in stride and, on some level, kind of like the abuse. Theirs isn\u2019t a struggle for human rights, justice, or equality\u2014no no---they fight back to protect the things that really matter to them, like managing an ant colony, procuring a rare collectible action figure or keeping a date with a cute girl\u2026\\n\r\nWhile every character in Prison School is \u2018fleshed out\u2019 in some sense, only the male protagonists are fleshed out in the personality department. This whole show is a parody of a young man\u2019s awkward and graceless journey through adolescence. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys finely-crafted, filthy humor and has enough self-awareness not to take this anime too seriously.",

I know the tags mention 'ecchi' in the mix, but J.C. staff actually got up and focused more on the actual STORY rather than focusing on asses and tits.\r\nsecond, the art style is...bizarre, in my eyes. it could that i'm used toHI-DEF art styles from such classics such as sailor moon or kill la kill, but its very...different in a way. but I've seen far worse animation in my time (school days) and school days deserves credit for not being in that league\\n\r\nnext, the characters. both good and bad are what i see in prison school's cast of people. from an unlucky guy, to the annoying 'tsundere', prison school has it all. i don't like ALL of em, bu like with the art style I've come across FAR worse.\\n\\n\r\nnow to talk about why i recommend prison school (even if i don't enjoy it that much)\\n\\n\r\nfirst, people often tell me that story has a couple of comedic parts here and there and, what can i say? while they weren't MY kind of funny, i do see it giving up so many laughs to the audiences.\\n\r\nnext, the art style is VERY unique and defiantly a next step for J.C. \\n\r\nanother thing is, people will enjoy characters i personally don't (and that's fine), shingo for example reminds me of the frosted tips douchebag stereotype, but some people may enjoy him some certain reasons, and i can take that at any day of the entire week. \\n\r\noverall? the anime is...meh, for me. for others? i totally recommend it, it seems fun to the other eyes of the community\\n\\n\r\nthis anime gets the final rating of:\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\r\nhowever, this anime gets the RECOMMENDATION rating of:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\ni recommend it THAT much!",

            "content": "Oh my Me, I was NOT ready for this! I mean... this anime, is like a Prison Break, crossed with angry-feminist-torture-porn, and some sort of 'love over the boundaries'- story, that I don't even know, what to call this, really! This consept alone shouldn't really work, when it comes down to the actual storytelling, or at the very least something, that I would like to watch, with a clear consience, and without making baby kittens cry - I swear, I don't even have testicles, and they still hurt! And still... I absolutely love this anime! I adore it! I want to see it again! Buttfirst... the review!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I'm gonna come out of the box, and say it out loud... None of these guys didn't really do anything wrong! No don't get me wrong, mind you... I wouldn't be too much thrilled, if I find out, that some creeps - and butt-ugly ones, for that matter - are possibly taking pictures of my naked body, when I'm not even shaved, or washd my hair yet, or put some makeup... whait, no, that's not the issue? Oh well... Anyway, what I'm trying to say, that the intentions from these blokes weren't really that noble, but hey, it's not like they hade some drugs and knives, to get those photos - just some ludicrous plan, rope, and cellphone! Yeah, sure, I guess that this particular girls-only- high school in a middle of nowhere doesn't really have that great of an internet connection to actually see some professional boobs and cunts - the ones with no bushes - but seriously... the reason for this whole premise, and for the story, for that matter, was so shallow and ridiculous, that I can't fell but to hate these tightass bitches, and feel sorry for these little deviants! Would it have been actually any different scenario, if the girls they were gonna peep, where actually some realistic, not-so-perfect- girls, instead of those pitch perfect underpant- models, that every single girl ever put on in anny kind of anime ever, ultimately is? I don't think so!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of ludicrous, when taken away the whole aspect of the story, theres really nothing much more to it, that some needles whipping, blood and boobysweat - those are some sweet boobies, I give them that - while humiliating and scorning these poor lads, all in some sick, psycothic girl-powered glee! Seriously, some of the punishment these guys get, over some of the most smallest little things, is so outstandingly ludicrous and distasteful, that it really makes wanna to protect these guys, rahter than call them scumbags and wish that they should just die already, like all of those girls who got peeped and I'm just guessin... there really wasn't that much to look at, was there? Some of these girls really put me in some protective, hide-my-true-gender- state, where I simply refused to view them as a boys and girls anymore, but like a faceless puppets, where some like to torture the rest, less aggressive and more passive puppets - kinda like my own barbie-games as a wee lass! \\n\\n\r\nSo the story isn't really nothing that great - epic speaches about wheter or not you should poop your pants, how great the asses are, compared to the boobs, and that sweaty-yet-epic arm wrestling- match - and the characters can really be a real hit-or- miss - absolutely stonecold leader, her masochist pawn, and truly psycothic bitch that cums if she gets kissed too roughly. (Seariously... how does that work?!) If your not into this sort of things, or this sort of people, it's truly understantable, that you're not going to like this anime either... altough the ending was really, truly satisfying! Trust me... you won't, and it's totaly fine! But, if you're a raging feminist, little on the sosiopath/psychotic side, and hungry to see some of the testicles being crushed, lads being humiliated, tortured and treated like shit, and you're not too squirmish about boobs, asses, blood or sweat, or prehaps just some deviant who likes to see his/her fellow men being treated the ways and methods that I used to dream of using on my former classmates from middle school, then this is truly a anime for you! \\n\\n\r\nAnd now, if you excuse me, I have this anime right here, waiting to be rewatched...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

If you have enjoyed such an anime at least once in your anime history there is a good chance you'll get enjoy this anime. If you haven't, then honestly don't waste your time.\r\nPrison School is an anime that has a refreshing setting with an interesting castof characters, combined with a mostly level headed protagonist put in an outrageous situation. All of these elements are then wrapped in over the top and sometimes awkward ecchi situations leading to an entertaining, dare I say, enjoyable anime.",

Every single scene was just hilarious and the plot was really well executed even tho It's an ecchi anime and most ecchi animes are just boob-based. I loved every character to bits and I just couldn't stop relying with them, I felt likeI was in that hellhole with them!. The animation and the art-style are just wonderful.

There were scenes so intense that i had to pause it and shout at the screen, seriously. \r\nStory: 6: as i said, absurd. A prison in a school? Sadist girls beating some guys for having hormones? Ridiculous, yet perfect for the series as it is. Dont forget that prison school is a comedy,so it is bound to exaggerate certain situations for the fun of it, and in my opinion it does it pretty well. Now, the series is full to the very top with those soooo classic cheap jappanese jokes about sex and poop and \"others\", but it excels on giving them an actual purpose for the plot and not just to try horribly to take a laugh out of you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8: beautiful is not the word i would describe for the art rather HILARIOUS (and explicit). The expresions of the characters are so funny and match the situation perfectly, showing you that it is not trying to be the \"pretty and sexy\" rather raw, explicit, funny and agressive. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7: music was good. Considering this is a comedy anime i would have expected to found the soundtrack a little more funny, but the epic soundtrack in some scenes was laughable enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8: does any character have a background story?  no. Do we get justification for their way of acting? no. and that does not metter PEOPLE. i have heard so many critics about this, and yeah if prison school were a romantic or psicological anime it would have mattered a lot, but this is just comedy!! the purpose of the series is not (clearly) to teach you a lesson about life, it is just to make you laugh, and for achieving that purpose we dont need reasonable and coherent characters, we need FUN characters. And oh my are they funny. Their way for each character to react to the several situations is hilarious and they are sooo ridiculous in their own unique way it is almost impossible not to want to hug them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9: if not a ten really. This is the only series i can recall that made me laugh so much. I almost felt this was ment to be a satire for common ecchi really: characters bleeding more through the mouth rather than the nose when excited, such grotesque way of presenting the sexual content... it is just hilarious. It got me freezing the screen every 10 minutes because of the anticipation. \\n\\n\r\nA must watch for people who: are not pecky with sexual content, can let go of their seriousness for an episode and laugh at cleverly yet ridiculously formulated jokes, do not expect a complicated plot and just want to laugh their asses of for a while. Really, really laugh their asses off.",

But enough about that, here is my review on Prison School. And yes this is my first time writing reviews so I'm really good at it.\r\nSo, the plot is just simple, a private strict all girl school (I don't remember what it's called) and later they began taking in five boys that is Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Joe and Andre. Seems normal until one night where they began to plan on peeking on girl's bathand getting caught by a Student Council. The next day the five boys were sent into a jail in the middle of campus. So what's so amazing about it? Just watch the first episode and I guarantee that you die of laughing with all the humorous gags and jokes throughout especially the facial expressions faces. But what kept it entertaining is the clliffhanger and the fast paced theme. The art is simply amazing, the voice acting and the sound design is excellent and the characters are enjoyable and funny as fuck. The storyline is not that good but overall this is the best anime so far.",

It hits you with fan service and comedy right out the gate. The thing that makes Prison School so good is the comedy that it hits you with. Not only that but also it has the most like able main Character that I have seen in awhile. So lets go through the good and the bad of this show. \r\nTHE GEWD\r\n     The Characters\r\nEach character in Prison School has their own unique qualities, such a diverse amount of characters.but this show has one of the strongest main characters that I have ever seen.  Kiyoshi Fujino does what ever it takes to get the job done. He doesn't fear embarrassment of what might happen with the actions he takes.\\n\\n\r\n      The Comedy \\n\r\nThis is what, in my opinion makes the entire show. The comedy is the strongest I have seen. I haven't laughed so hard out loud in ages. The jokes hit fast and they hit strong.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE BAD\\n\\n\r\n     The Fan service \\n\r\nI hate that I'm saying this but the Fan service in this show is way WAY too much. It is so much that it takes away from the show itself making it less credible in my opinion. If they did without at least 10% of the fan service that they have the show would be much better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nOver all this show is a great watch and it took me a week to decide whether or not this show was a good recommendation to tell people of. But after thinking about it, it is a show that I would Recommend but only if they can handle the fan service which is a bit too much other wise I give this show a whopping 7 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "Welcome we are in a high school setting, yet again, but let\u2019s turn into a prison and not just have a story about simply trying to escape, but let\u2019s have the characters actually wanting to stay in prison. \r\nThe Video Review is up on my channel, but here is the written Review.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nWhat happens when you get 5 boys and put them in a school with girls only. Simple they boys try to take a peek at the girls when their bathing, obviously they get caught and thrown into prison, in their school. Naturally in a prison type setting, the characters would be aimingto escape, but in this case, if they were to attempt escape and get caught 3 times, they are expelled from high school, and if you were expelled from high school perving, good luck in your social life. The first half of the story starts off as one of the boys are trying to escape the prison to go on a date, whereas the second half focuses on all the boys trying to stay in prison.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s interesting how they throw in the idea, that the boys love being in prison. Almost at every moment the boys are punished by the girls, they love it, hence why they love the prison. But the most interesting part of the story is that, the boys are going through that phase where they are trying finding themselves, of course trying to find a way to get girls, so it plays the idea of a coming of age story. The pacing of the story is quite rushed, it\u2019s a pacing that gives you a lot of information, but never really lets you sink in all the details beforehand. There\u2019s a lot of cliff hangers leaving you wondering, how are they going to get out of the situation they\u2019re in. The reason for this is because, the dialogue being spoken to quite fast, because they were trying to fit in so many things, into such a short anime. It may have been 2 arcs, but that 2 arcs felt rather rushed. Sure it\u2019s ridiculous sometimes, and doesn\u2019t make sense, but at the same time, the story doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKiyoshi Fujino, is the straight man out of all the boys and the main protagonist. He is the guy who tries his best to be good, even though deep inside he just like any of the other guys in a perverted way. Over the course of the anime, he tries to get along with his fellow jailbirds and keep them safe from the prison wardens. Unfortunately he is nothing special of a protagonist, he\u2019s just a complete straight man, willing to help his friends. And he is shy around girls and not completely opened. But I guess he is needed, because the next few characters are pretty crazy.\\n\\n\r\nTakehito Morokuzu, also known as Gakuto is well, what you would a call a mad genius type. He is the one usually coming up with plans to escape prison or get the boys out of trouble. Despite his intelligence, he will go to great lengths when it comes to girls. He is shown be the mostly openly perverted out of all the guys.\\n\\n\r\nReiji Androu or also known as Andre is the biggest and the strongest out of all the boys. Although usually calm and a gentle person, he is a complete masochists, meaning he loves to be punished by the prison wardens, especially the Vice-President. He shown to care for his friends over himself, although this could also imply that he just wants to get punished more, because of his masochists side. \\n\\n\r\nJouji Nezu, is always seen wearing a hoodie over himself, no matter what outfit he wears. He is probably the biggest oddball of the group, with interests for other things outside the others, such as his loves for ants. Not only that he has a chronic cough, which he coughs blood. Despite him struggling with his speech, he\u2019 got the most gut when it comes to calling out the wardens. \\n\\n\r\nShingo Wakamoto is the last of the 5 boys. He plays the cool guy of the group, trying to act all cool to everyone else. He also acts the most selfish and becomes a hypocrite later on the series, but starts trying to redeem himself. But its due to his cool boy act start, he gets quite the development, as he learns how to forgive people and help his friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe prison wardens are Mari Kurihara, Hana Midorikawa and Meiko Shiraki. And they play as the main villains in prison school, their goal was to prove the fact that all boys a scum and get them expelled from school. They\u2019re also responsible for the majority of punishment and fan service for the boys. Apart from Shingo, no other character really gets a lot of development. So why it is the characters are likeable. It\u2019s the way the characters interact with each other. Because despite having completely different personalities, the characters get along with well with each other and most of their interactions are actually very entertaining. Actually the only really small development is when the boys start learning how to trust each other, as at the start they were all just new boys at a new school, so there is that aspect that they learn how to work together, to get through things.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style looks quite mature as if it\u2019s for a more mature serious audience, as it looks grittier than most other anime. Even though the character designs look like any other anime characters, it\u2019s the fact that you can tell they\u2019re clearly separated from the background. Now the way the fan service is down, I\u2019m fine with it but to a certain extent sometimes it becomes annoying. The genre is considered ecchi, so having fan service is no problem, and censoring is not a problem at all, considering the majority of anime is censored, compared to the manga counterpart, but some of the censoring is just plain annoying. It\u2019s annoying for the eyes when every type of censoring is done with a bright shining light out of nowhere, it just makes some scenes very bright. However that being said the art and animation also adds to some of the comedy to Prison School. Some of the faces and expressions that characters pull off is completely over the top exaggerated funny, and it makes such good use of the art style, because the characters for a brief moment start looking realistic.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Prison School, is nothing special. You can barely hear it and they don\u2019t really add too much to the scenes. There is maybe some okay rock tracks in there, but there is nothing I would listen to by itself. The opening and ending songs are great and funny, which I think fits very well for this type of genre, and its sung by the cast. But their animation for it, is kind of underwhelming. What I do like about the sound is the voice actors, because they have pulled off a good job of making these characters sound very funny, but also somewhat serious at the same time, especially for Gakuto. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough some of the jokes get stale from time to time, and the ecchi can completely be annoying, I cannot deny the fact that I loved watching this show. It\u2019s actually legit funny, some of the jokes are clever, and the art style just adds to the creativity of some of them. Some of it can be toilet humour, but if it makes you laugh, it\u2019s still funny and entertaining regardless. The story plays out like a typical escape prison story, but then flips the script later on and becomes a trying to stay in prison story. The character interactions make the show even funnier and their personalities are so likeable as well, due to their differences. It\u2019s really enjoyable, because it knows what it is and doesn\u2019t try to hide the fact it\u2019s completely over the top as well, so it\u2019s an anime you don\u2019t have to take too seriously. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Prison School, I give it an 8, it may play out basic to start off with. But when the story changes itself and becomes a story of wanting to stay in prison, every moment feels like how are they going to get out of this predicament moment. I like how the story is sort of a finding one\u2019s identity story as well. The thing holding it back is that it felt a bit rushed and it\u2019s hard to take everything in completely. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, it gets a 8 and 7 from me. The art style is quite good to look at, and its uniqueness adds a lot to the comedy, whether it\u2019s the facial expressions or the atmosphere. However the fan service censorship can be annoying when all of it is just bright light, shining in your face. The soundtrack is nothing special, and opening and ending themes are good. It\u2019s the voice acting that\u2019s great, because every character is done very well and they all sound funny, especially Gakuto.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, I give it a 7. The biggest reason holding the characters back is the lack of any proper development besides, Kiyoshi, Shingo and Gakuto to an extent. No other character shows that much development, especially the wardens, maybe Hana, but that is more of a reaction. But the character interactions are great and the different personalities really add to the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nFor my personal enjoyment, I give a 9. I love watching how the characters were going to escape prison, I love watching how they were going to stay in prison. I love watching how their planning and plans go into action. The comedy makes me laugh, and I wish for a second season, because I think the end sets up for an interesting story. The ecchi can be quite annoying, with the censorship sometimes, but it\u2019s not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Prison School, after rounding it up, I give it an 8/10. It\u2019s a funny anime, but sometime may go too far for some people, who can\u2019t take a joke. I recommend it to people looking for comedy, or a prison drama fans. The comedy will make you laugh, just be wary some of the ecchi can be annoying.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Wow. I never thought I would have such respect for a comedy anime. This show does so many things well it's hard to know where to begin. First off, I have to express my admiration for just how confidently the show takes its approach to humor. It's just so bold in how it does absurd comedy it's hard not to be awestruck. \r\nThe premise of the show is pretty basic, but the actual events that take place actually have tons of moving parts. There's so much attention to detail that you'll be very impressed with how elaborate and ingenious it all is when plans unfold.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are 5 protagonists, really only 3 ever get anything more than a side role. The remaining 2 characters do have their occasional moments, but mostly they're just there. Would the show have been better if they'd had more screen time? That's hard to say given how much I already enjoyed it. The antagonists are equally likable but for different reasons. The punishments they dish out are absurd in the best way possible. And their attitudes really sell their roles as spiteful wardens. \\n\\n\r\nHow would I describe the show's style of humor? The first word that comes to mind is \"ridiculous.\" The gratuitous fan service is hardly worth mentioning because most of the show's hilarity comes from the situations the writers think up. Things always go awry when the protagonists plan to escape or what have you, and the dread of them being discovered is an experience in and of itself. And the execution of their far-fetched schemes always involve them doing something utterly unbelievable. \\n\\n\r\nSo now I'll tell you what not to expect from this anime. Don't expect formulaic episodes or childish humor. Make no mistake, everything is very well thought-out and you'll never be disappointed. This is hands-down the best comedy anime I've seen.",

            "content": "I wanted to watch this for some time and finished the series today. However, I expected something with a more punch in it.\r\nThis anime is based around idea of a school having a \"prison\" for group of students and those students trying to get out of that prison. There's a lot of very crude humor and fancervice(? not sure if I'd call it fancervice) that has subtlety of getting hit by a sledgehammer in the face. The anime doesn't hold back. There are S&M-related jokes, quite a lot of fem-dom, nudity, etc. For some reason the whole thing didn't really click with me, however.\r\nStory:\r\nRidiculous premise,dramatic moments and humor. All of this is rough and direct, without any subtleties. We have sexual jokes, nudity, extremely violent interactions, and blood (for comedy effect). The anime does not mess around. The story spans one continuous \"arc\" meaning things happen one after another, and there's always driving force moving the story forward. It is fairly solid, I'd say.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'm not fond of the shading method used in this anime. Drawings of character themselves look great, but shading used on it sometimes looks \"cheap\" and gives the whole iamge a bit of a \"dirty\" feeling. I'm not sure if it is intentional. Characters are quite well drawn. One female character has HUGE assets (for comedy purposes) and wears skimpy clothes to boot, probably for comedy purposes. Overall art is pretty solid, but I'm not sure why they selected this approach to shading.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSolid music, but appears to be underutilized.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nDue to ridiculous story, characters also act in ridiculous way, due to being in ridiculous situations. The most memorable character is Hana, but unfortunately she does not get enough screen time. Other characters appear to work as some sort of plot devices, and do not stand out too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIT was alright. I thought it woudl be better. THere were some cool moments here and there, but I really expected a bigger impact.\\n\\n\r\nOVverall:\\n\r\nWorth a watch if you enjoy ecchi and crude humor. Another reason to watch the are scenes that involve Hana, which are often much more interesting than the rest of the show. Unfortunately, there's a small number of those scenes.",

            "content": "Two Thumbs up! A solid 10 from me.\r\nWho here aside from me has seen a perverted moment that you think there was not just punishment made? I bet i hit a bell. Anyways... with this show a justice(in my opinion) is preformed. LITERAL JAIL TIME AT SCHOOL! WHERE THEY ARE Belittled IN COUNTLESS WAYS! I could go into graphic detail but that is aside from the point. Yes, there was payback made but hope was instilled. True, one should feel angered towards the proven guilty but isn't there more that meets the eyes? Something or two that are eyes can not see even if staringat it directly. Not something that is invisible per-say but more wrapped in hidden code. One in particular that portrays highly in this case is social norms. A guy and a girl start a family. The origin for that you ask? Without content it is a fair guess that one of them felt a grand urge that would not subside. Given how i think women are forced to hide their feelings in order not to suffer emotionally leaves one party. The sole man must act. This is just part 1 of part 2. Part 2 is why is the man the aggressor here? It is not just because he alone remains it is nature. Try as we might our minds wish to procreate to stay alive. Alas, this is where the female reemerges. She must be made to be strong yet weak. Strong to endure the troubles of what will lie ahead and weak to give in to fate. Her main weakness her privates. In view they are taken in by storm. No matter the strength one has there is no escaping it. Where there are toys you will find kids. So, it only makes sense where you as a man go a women will to. Yes, freedom of will is lovely but somethings can't be help. All said in mind this goes to proven that yes men are guilty of perversion but they are not the only guilty party. Guilt is only guilt because something has shifted the balance greatly. For example, robbing a bank or murdering a person which will you feel guilty on? you picked one? HA, you have proven my point. No matter how you see it both are guilty actions. Our society demands punishment and to progress we must see someone lesser on the ladder. Ergo, a scapegoat is unavoidable. No matter how you spin a coin there are at least two faces. \\n\\n\r\n*wipes forehead* sorry. Normally, not the kind of review i do but i felt it needed to be addressed before i continue. If you are still with me i thank you. Where was i? oh yeah, the boys found guilty of peeping change. Not quite a simple meta-morph but inside. Their view on the world becomes altered. The women could have simply left the men rot in jail but they chose to whip them, humiliate them and destroy their living mind. all for what? peeping? peeping doesn't involve physical harm.... at least last time i checked. how is that trade off fair? This leads the viewer to root for the guys to make a stand and fight. Not just to get out but to better themselves. For an anime to deliver such a message and have a nice plot/art/sound to top it off who can resist such a wonderful ice-cream Sunday?",

All lighting, shading, expressions, and details are drawn insanely well. This anime had me bursting out with laughter more so than any comedy I have ever seen. Try not to eat or drink liquids when you watch this because every couple of seconds you're bound to spit it out. This anime is LOADED with AMAZING fanservice and everything is incrediblydetailed. The plot is also unique and absolutely perfect for setting up the humor and fanservice of this series. Sure, you won't find yourself in tears like a good drama plot but this anime is not a drama. It's downright hilarious and it crosses so many lines. The soundtrack is perfect for the series as well. There's lots of epic tunes to make a huge deal out of something so hilariously simple. The cast of characters is also brilliant. At first I thought you these guys were so weird but they actually turn out to have very specific personalities. The female leads are also very individual and the epidomy of sexy. All in all, if you love ecchi, fanservice, and comedy then this is your masterpiece rivaling ecchi tyrants such as DXD.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Oustanding animation and detail.\\n\r\n-Absolutely hilarious!!!\\n\r\n-Comical storyline.\\n\r\n-Excellent non-cliche characters.\\n\r\n-10/10 fanservice around the clock.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Unspectacular soundtrack.",

            "content": "A prison gay review of Prison School\r\nPrison School is a comedy about a group of 5 boys who attempt to peek on the girl's changing rooms in their school, but after being caught by the Gestapo-esque Underground Student Council, are subjected to imprisonment inside of the school's grounds. Herein, the main characters attempt to survive the brutality of the USC, as they conspire against the boys, trying to expel them. \r\nPrison School is an extremely ecchi anime, on par with actual hentai, and it is completely unapologetic on this front. Not only is the fanservice omnipresent (with the USC's vice president more or less servingentirely this role, whose breast size probably set a world record), but, the characters routinely experience severe punishment for their misdeeds, which is a great pleasure for someone with a reverse ryona fetish, such as myself.\\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy, Prison School's main entertainment value lies in its ability to be comedic. The writing is well-done, but where Prison School really shines is with its characters. While the main character, Kiyoshi is relatively 'normal', others, such as the masochistic Andre, Joe, who has a loving for ants, and Gakuto, my personal favourite of the series, an otaku with a strong interest in the Three Kingdoms (a historical period when China was separated into three kingdoms, as the name implies) with very strong leadership abilities, strategies, and an overall strong character, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Additionally, his voice actor did an excellent job, and captured his character greatly.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of Prison School can be summarised in a few sentences, as I did earlier in this review, even, but the episode by episode happenings are far from predictable. Each episode is varied and the exploits of the pentagonists are all a pleasure to view. This writing is particularly good for a comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Prison School is a well-made anime. It's not one of the greatest comedies ever written, and some may find it hard to look past the raunchy nature of it, but if you can, you're in for one of the best balances of story, comedy and characters I've seen in an anime of this genre for quite some time.",

            "content": "Story (6/10) - Every episode of this series, I asked myself one question: What did I just watch? In watching the four school prisoners trying to escape, the only comedic aspect I could find was watching one get repeatedly beaten by the sadistic warden. I felt that the 'drama' during certain scenes was more over-the-top than the laugh I feel that was trying to come of it.  \nArt (7/10) - The art in this show is good. One thing I couldn't understand throughout watching this is why Andre's face is the way it is. I know that's how his character design is, but still,why? \\n\\n\nSound (4/10) - The sound for this show was... okay. Aside from introducing the show and ending it before showing a small preview of the next episode, there wasn't much at all.\\n\\n\nCharacter (5/10) - I believe this is what people say when they say characters are flat. The boys are your typical perverts who got caught, and now have to pay for it.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment (6/10) - I enjoyed this show a little more than I thought I would. Although, it probably wasn't until I got a little invested around episode 4, maybe 5.\\n\\n\nOverall (5.6/10) - I read the summary for this show, and didn't think it was for me. I was very right, but I had to scratch the itch of at least watching it out of curiosity. Was it as bad as I thought it'd be? No, but it has very few redeeming qualities to it. Is this anime for everyone? No, obviously not. But I might read the Manga just to find out how it ends, someday...",

Besides that, the story, art, humor, ecchines, everithing was spot on.\r\nFirst anime I saw, that had this perfect connection between humour(enhanced by), visual art and ecchines.\r\nScenes that used these  three components  never felt forced or unnatural. I think that would change if one of the components was missing... And that is why I think this is masterpiece(?). It managed to do all, and to do it well.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nIam writing this review after several weeks since I finished this anime, and after some reflection, I must give it 10/10... And this whole review perfectly captures my feelings about this anime.",

            "content": "Do you find yourself perpetually disappointed with comedy-based anime? Great, because that's how you're supposed to feel.\r\nYou fear that you will once again be disappointed, but fear not, for yours truly, the most resourceful general in nerima has come to flip the entire dang game around, together with his rowdy pals.\r\nThis is a story about truth, betrayal, trust, male bonding and struggles towards seemingly unatainable goals, and it just so happens to be absolutely hilarious.\r\nStory\r\nYou'd think this would be a normal harem/ecchi shitshow with the setup, but it's not.\r\nfive guys get into a formerly all-girls high school and are thus the only boys present atschool.\\n\\n\r\nFive sexually frustrated males who most likely spent their life at all boys schools finally find themselves in a utopic situation, but things soon go awry. As they attempt to peep into the girls bath they get exposed and are sentenced to one month in the campus' very own prison. This is where the scheming begins, as all of them, driven by their own agendas, try to break out of prison, and raunchy, hilarious antics ensue as their once individual motives and struggles eventually intertwine and unite in a beautiful friendship bonding.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime stand out from every other comedy anime is that it is heavily plot driven and serious, and the comedy is a secondary element which revolves around the seriousness of the plot, whereas most comedy anime are made in the style of \"daily life of highschool boys\" where no further contextualization is given and all it is is just random clips you're supposed to laugh at despite not having established an emotional connection with the characters, and here's a big heads up for the oblivious anime industry: IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. Establishing deeper emotional connection to the characters and a clear cut story is CRUCIAL for a comedy to work, which comedy-based anime as a rule of thumb always fails to realize. Jesus, we might as well be watching cat vids on youtube. Luckily though, this anime successfully does all of the above, and brilliantly so.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is on point and fits the shows mature themes perfectly, what else can i say, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound? Who gives a hoot? it was fine is suppose.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis is where the show truly shines. Each character is multifaceted and very well developed, each with their own distinct, eerily creepy personalities. whereas in your average anime comedy each character is just a walking gag with no depth whatsoever. The characters are so well fleshed out they could rival the characters of NHK ni youkoso.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime is an unencumbered pleasure-ride, not because of the ecchi, in fact, for everything BUT the ecchi. It takes you on the journey of a lifetime and does things no anime you've ever seen do. The show is very unpredictable and it will take you by surprise and have you laughing your ass off when you least expect it.\\n\\n\r\nThe eerie creepiness of the characters, the serious plot and equally serious artstyle, the raunchy brilliance of the hilarious antics, it all makes for a heavenly combo that i cannot get enough of. \\n\\n\r\nI wish for a bright future with a similar, dare i say deconstructionist, approach to comedy.",

There are ridiculous moments, like amazingly dumb moments. I like this anime a LOT ... Seriously look at my username;) I'd give this anime a 11/10 if i could. Plus, if you like fanservice, this will be the best time of your entire life. When I began to watch the anime, I didn't really have expectations, if you have watched enough ecchi anime youwill understand but I really was surprised, the plot is amazing and like a said previously, the characters are funny as hell! With that show you have to expect the unexpected. I would recommend it to anybody that's not afraid of the fanservice. So yeah I wish my review helped you to decide wether or not you would want to watch it. Enjoy!!",

It had some intense and exciting moments and some like smart plans moments (kinda like in the ending of death note if you know what I'm talking about)\\n\\n\r\nThe only bad things about it that I can think of (That some people might not like but personally I don't have any problems with it) was that the women were the bosses in it, I've seen another anime where the women \"rules\" and a lot of people were hating on that in the comments so I thought I would include it here just so you know if you hate bossy women kind of animes then this is NOT for you :( \\n\\n\r\nMy ratings:\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This review is analytical so bear with me. This review may be dry but if you have a firm grasp of the English language this will suit you fine.\r\nMain Points:\r\n- This is an ecchi anime; expect the expected and the unexpected :).\r\n- Visuals are stunning.\r\n- Retardedly stupid funny situations I have never seen in any other anime.\r\n- Toilet humor and sex jokes.\r\n- Definitely not for everyone.\r\nI have watched several ecchi animes: To Love Ru, High School DxD, Seikon no Quaser etc. This anime looks at 5 high school guys with healthy libidos in what used to be an elite all-girls school. I know the previoussentence sounds like your typical ecchi plot but read on. This review is a little dry but pseudo-analytical.\\n\\n\r\nThe libido is a caged animal that is buried inside the skull that wants out and needs to be set free. This anime shows that although a man may think with his penis; mankind has been known for his creativity and ingenuity when faced with adversary. Novel ideas, creativity and hard work spurn out of man's needs. I am not talking about desperate needs of hunger or thirst but that of the libido. It has been said that when man thinks with his penis, he does not think or is brainless. Prison school is showing that man does think with his dick but with the inclusion of using his ingenious, creative brain. This notion combined with titillating (yes pun intended) visuals, plus a comedic and effective plotline makes Prison School truly enjoyable. Prison School innovates and redefines what a good comedic ecchi show should be. Definitely a rare gem.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi genre is not for everyone. People should know what they are getting at before they watch an ecchi anime. But this is not your typical ecchi anime, from the first episode onward it can be said that this is truly a unique anime. The plot/story is well thought out with superb attention to detail. The story is fresh and it does not rehash old plotlines or formulaic circumstances based on other animes. The comedy and jokes are mature and dirty in nature as well expected. This anime contains a good amount of toilet humor so be warned. Its integration with the plot is very good. Enmeshed with this is exemplary executed visuals and art.\\n\\n\r\nAn attention to detail is exemplified in the art work and visuals. The character's emotions and facial expressions, although sometimes exaggerated, convey exactly what they feel with a twist of comedy, not a lot of anime can pull that off I believe. With this attention to detail in mind, I could attest that the visuals are certainly enticing. The satisfaction I get is that of erotic appeal but with the sophistication of art. Now that is hard to achieve. I have noticed certain nuances in the art. Even color shades and skin tones are well executed. The level of detail put into the art and visuals shows. Also with regards to the manga, I cannot attest to any comparisons with the manga, but I can say that this is one fine show.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that the voice acting is superb. The talented cast consists of experienced seiyu from other high profile animes. A terrific voice acting draws the viewer in. What else can I say? The soundtrack is the only thing I won\u2019t praise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, WOW. I can't stop grinning after each episode. A must watch. To all guys out there with perfectly functional eryngii: it is your obligation to watch this show, and hopefully enjoy it.\\n",

I've avoided watching this anime for weeks thinking it was not my type and that I would be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nThe characters are all amazing. First you have the five boys taken prisoner, who each have their own unique personality. There's Andre, a morbidly obese masochist, Joe, a hooded guy obsessed with ants, Shingo, and American delinquent, Gakuto, who is a hilarious mastermind, and Kiyoshi, the dedicated main dude. Among the Underground Student Council are three unique women. Meiko is asadistic Vice President with boobs larger than her head. Hana is even more violent with a grudge against Kiyoshi and an strange obsession with golden showers. Finally there's the President Mari with a hate for perverts because of her own father, the chairman of the school who's obecessed with butts. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is not the best yet I couldn't stop watching. There are some hilariously dramatic scenes where I realize, wait this is about someone sacrificing themselves by shitting themselves or coming together to answer the question of which is better, breasts or butts? There were points where I had to pause because I was laughing so hard I didn't want to miss a second. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't expect to enjoy this anime as much as I did, but it's definitely worth watching.",

It makes funny moments way more funnier. \r\nOnly one or two character stand out, but I won't remember anyone in some time. It is more event driven, than story or character. \r\nI don't watch anime like this often, so I can say, everyone can find enjoyment in it. Somemoments feel rushed, but it is good show anyway.",

It speaks the truth about human evolution and the things really important in life. I think, that if enough people see this show, it really could push the human race to that next step that needs to be taken and maybe, even us humans could become generous beings, onesthat can truly respect the offerings of life.",

            "content": "There's a very subversive sexual dynamic at play here. All boys are sexually corrupt, pervs to the core. Girls are the moral beings, those who have to protect themselves from this creepy sexuality -- but, in this subversion, actually have the power to punish those advances, to attack back at the male gaze. This is the opposite of the real world, where woman's sexuality is the one being judged and punished.\r\nBut is more complex than that, for the boys perviness is limitless and adaptable. As is sexuality, the girls' strictness and sadist pleasure-less practices gives birth to the boys' masochist tendencies, feeding the same sexualitythey desire to punish. And, in this school of female anti-sexuality, the girls are oblivious to the natural sensuality of their existence, even to the most obvious degree: their bodies, and it's exposition, which actually feeds the same male gaze that they're trying to attack.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a clear message - most eloquently put by the opening and ending themes - that this effort to control the boys sexuality is useless, for sex (they call it 'love', but let's be serious...) is a part of the human nature & experience. And this is why the real prison... is love. (But actually is moralism.)\\n\\n\r\nMostly, Prison School is (weirdly) so much fun. The story is a very particular struggle to survive oppression -- there's a constant tension to escape the prison, the punishments, the attention of the girls-jailers. The boys succumb to intrigue, but there's also a greater arc about their friendship forming and giving them strength to persevere, turning the final stretch of the series in a great game of wits. The characters are both likeable and stupid enough to deeply root for them. And is just constantly funny.\\n\\n\r\nLoose thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n- Overall, the strongest way to maintain the boys locked up is the threat of public humiliation. There's a very constant fear to be socially judged in most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Outlaw legos.\\n\\n\r\n- Kiyoshi butt is a black hole that attracts a lot of unwanted, violent penetration.\\n\\n\r\n- Butt philosophy. VERY INTENSE butt philosophy.\\n\\n\r\n- No one that likes sumo/crows/butts can be a bad person.\\n\\n\r\n- Everything surrounding Hana is my favorite, and the development of her fetish and/or attraction is one of the best parts of the series. \\n\\n\r\n- Which leads to a hilarious Isaac Newton's apple falling on the head epiphany, but instead of an apple is a mushroom, and instead of the head is a butt. And instead of discovering gravity she remembers a penis. \\n\\n\r\n- Which leads to a great, rage-filled, scene about cutting mushrooms.\\n\\n\r\n- A well-placed (and perfect metaphor) Medusa.\\n\\n\r\n- The coloring of the series annoys me a lot, but I can't quite place it: the texture seems to be misplaced light, or something like this. A pity, as there's some really good cuts.\\n\\n\r\nMVP: The director, Kurihara.",

Well at least for me that question can be answered by one word: Hana, (the Tsundere Overlord). \r\nWell not only that, the comedy is also great, at least if you enjoy yours quite sexual and stupid sometimes. \r\nThe story is simple yet effective to deliver the puns and fanservice.\r\nThe opening had me singing along, it sets some kind of epic thone to the show, I really liked it. I downloaded it to my USB and I play it while I drive sometimes.\r\nCharacter wise Idig the group of boys, it definetly makes you feel like you are part of them, it should be one at least one you can sympathize with. Personally two of them felt pretty dull (but hey, at least they are not that important to the main story so no problemo).\\n\r\nAs I mentioned on the begining HANA: Soo, if you enjoy your girls the kind that wants to slice your sausaje off and kiss you while doing so you will adore her. \\n\r\nAlso there are other girls don't worry, Prison School has tits and ass more than it has an actual plot (Not that it's a bad thing of course).\\n\r\nSo in summary, relatable male characters, female characters to drull for, interesting subplots.\\n\r\nIf you are a man you will enjoy it, trust me.

The man accidentally falls with his hands on a woman's breast, the man gets a nosebleed after seeing an attractive girl, and so on. Although Prison School has the poop jokes and sex jokes, there is a major difference between how this show does it and how other shows do it. Prison School is extremely intense and a little avant-garde. At the end of each episode I was exhausted by the amount of intensity that was put in each scene. \r\nThis show thrives off it over-the-top, nonsensical humor. If you do not enjoy this typeof story, you will defiantly not like this show. The characters are crazy, the situations are insane, and the comedy is actually good. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a lot of dirty humor.",
