            "content": "If you haven't watched the original Full Metal Panic! series, you should watch it before watching The Second Raid, because it's the sequel to the original series. In regards to Fumoffu?, you don't have to watch it before TSR.\r\nWith that away, let's get to reviewing. The story in TSR easily surpasses any 13-episode show I've watched as of writing this review. The pacing varies a bit; suddenly this and that happens and then it's done quickly, and you may be left baffled ), but some scenes are very slow, like the scene when Chidori cut Sousuke's hair. Some may not like that, but I thinkthat the pace was just right at the right moments, and that it created just the kind of mood the scene needed. \\n\\n\r\nTSR moves a bit away the funny high school life of Chidori and Sousuke, leaving the room for more drama and a couple of episodes focusing on Chidori and Sousuke's emotional struggles with themselves and each other after certain events happen. However, it preserves a bit of the great high school humor you're probably familiar with by now, especially in the earlier episodes. The story was excellent in my opinion, and the only thing that drags it down is the rather loose ending; it seems like things aren't over yet. There are also small bits of fanservice here and there, just so you're warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is, to quote a friend of mine, &quot;unreal&quot;. I thought the quality of the original series was excellent, but this just blew me right out of the water. The coloring is vivid, and the level of detail in the backgrounds is very good. The Special effects are very good too, and the lighting effects are astounding. In fact, the best I've seen. The detail of screens and monitors is incredible, too. Shortly summarized, the animation quality is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a vast improvement from the original series. The OP and ED themes are as good as ever, and songs I'd listen to over and over again. The background music is incredible, too. The pieces are great to listen to, and they fit right in with the mood, and amplify it. The tense music during Chidori's episode was the best when it came to setting the mood, if you ask me. The sound effects are nothing I can say bad things about either, from birds chirping to explosion sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have gotten a lift, too. Of course, it's the characters we have learned to love, and now they're getting some good character development. Especially on Chidori and Sousuke's part. I really liked how they portrayed Chidori's feelings towards Sousuke, and in the finale episodes, Sousuke changed a lot. He's slowly turning into a human and not just a stiff guy who acts only on orders. Throw in a hilariously paranoid bad guy as well as two messed-up twin sisters, and it's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really, really enjoyed The Second Raid, but I do hope there's more Full Metal Panic! to come.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "It is fairly uncommon for a sequel to excel over the original in virtually every way possible. That is, typically, even if the sequel is mostly superior, there are often a few noticeable elements missing from it which made the original enjoyable (A personal example would be Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid (TSR), on the other hand, is one of these rare instances of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in all respects.\r\nAll around, The Second Raid has a better plot, better scripting, better character development, better action, better humor, and better animation. To get a good idea aboutthe essence of The Second Raid, simply imagine a tighter, darker, more focused, serious, and mature series which takes all of the good and worthwhile elements from the original and improves on them. In a nutshell, this is Full Metal Panic: The Grown-Up Version.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, what The Second Raid does remarkably well is genuinely challenge its characters, not only physically and psychologically, but also morally. Unlike much of the tactical action sequences of the first season, the sense of danger and isolation is now much more real, as well as enemies which are genuine threats and not simply a string of forgettable,  one-dimensional \"terrorist/bad guys\" (Takima Kugayama and his \"sister\" from the first series) or anonymous henchmen to be easily defeated. For a more specific contrast, think of the scene from the original Full Metal Panic where Melissa Mao, armed with only a rifle, taunts and entire troop of hostiles from a rooftop, with no cover, apparently not the least bit concerned about being shot, despite the fact that half a dozen enemy arm slaves have their guns trained on her. On the other hand, simply seeing TSR's brutal and effective killing machines, the Xia twins, in action should be enough to realize that the days of relatively easy and unrealistic victories are over.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, our heroic protagonist Souske Sagara, who was previously a fairly single-minded \"military maniac\" with very little sense of self-doubt, now finds himself actually having to ask the important, life-changing questions, namely, who am I? What am I doing? Is what I am doing right? and more specifically, Do I like doing nothing but following orders? Do I like being surrounded by weak people who constantly need me for support?--All questions which the first series never dares to ask. As an example, a particularly memorable and extremely well-written phone conversation occurs between Souske and the mysterious MITHRIL intelligence agent, Wraith, in which he is for the first time forced to deal with the actual consequences of his inability to adapt to civilian life--thus the series' oft-used and never-questioned \"comic relief\" device quickly and seamlessly turns into  an opportunity for some very interesting and dramatic character development. It is also impressive the way in which the writers subtly work in a couple references to the seemingly insignificant events from Fumoffu . Later on we also get to witness firsthand what happens to Kaname when Souske is no longer there to protect her. The results are equally as enticing.\\n\\n\r\nThis motif applies not only to the characters, but MITHRIL as an organization itself. In TSR, we are no longer simply expected to believe that a mercenary organization which acts as some kind of a non-partisan global police force (\"we fight terrorists and blow up drug factories\" [sic]) can exist without its own set of serious internal problems and existential, even moral dilemmas. The most prominent instance of this is the way in which the issue of double-agents simply working for the highest bidder (i.e. mercenaries being mercenaries) is dealt with in a much more serious and significant way than the first season. TSR singlehandedly makes MITHRIL into a well-rounded, believable organization, and not simply a bunch of people with high-tech equipment on a high-tech submarine--as was implied in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, The Second Raid is, not surprisingly, also a significant improvement over the first series. Kyoto Animation, now known almost exclusively for their \"moe\" shows, demonstrate their ability to make an action series which looks just as good, if not better, than most similar shows coming out today. The CGI is surprisingly well integrated, the character designs are still faithfully adapted from Gonzo's original, and the background designs are detailed and believable (the production staff did some lengthy on-site research of downtown Hong Kong). In fact, the sheer attention to detail in general is one of the things that makes this series truly stand out on the technical level. This includes all the little things which add to the overall sense of realism, particularly in the action scenes, such as a gun jamming, someone stumbling or tripping while running, desperately padding the ground behind them for an object to throw, or even something like tiny drops of bottled Scotch hitting the table during the pouring process. On a audio-related note, ADV's dub of this series is one of the best I have heard thus far, especially in regards to rendering important conversations and lines of dialogue in a strikingly dramatic, yet believable fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the examples are too numerous to list exhaustively, all of this hopefully can somewhat elucidate how well The Second Raid in essence works within the confines and limitations of the \"Full Metal Panic universe,\" while at the same time managing to fully flesh out many of the  interesting and underdeveloped potentialities of that universe. As a technical achievement, it is both more colorful as well as more violent, and as a writing achievement it is also much deeper and far more realistic. On the whole, this series manages to be highly engaging on both the intellectual and visceral levels, in a way that the first offering simply never fully realized. All these elements combined make Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid a personal number one favorite within the mecha-action genre. \\n\\n\r\nAside from a somewhat \"rushed\" finale, perhaps my only complaint about this series is its length: at a mere 13 episodes, and an intentionally \"open\" ending, it naturally leaves one wishing for more. However, keeping in mind that a series' length can be a curse as well as a blessing, perhaps the relatively short episode count is something to be desired if the tightly-written, plot-driven quality is sustained throughout. After all, keeping in mind that decent chunks of the first series were simply filler, perhaps a 24-episode reboot of this would not be preferable after all. \\n\\n\r\nI believe this sequel is aimed at adults, not teenagers, and will have less appeal to people are faint of heart or generally unwilling to ask any serious moral and/or existential questions. Therefore for those who perhaps were, or currently are dismayed by the initial series' somewhat mediocre and \"juvenile\" nature, I can firmly say that the existence of The Second Raid makes it all completely worth it. Basically, this is Full Metal Panic's The Dark Knight. Only better.\\n",

            "content": "People may look at this and think of it as a typical mecha anime but if you\u2019ve seen Full Metal Panic then you\u2019ll know that this franchise isn\u2019t loved only for its mechs.\r\nFull Metal Panic! The Second Raid is the true sequel to the fantastic Shounen, Romance, Comedy, Mecha anime; Full Metal Panic! It basically starts where the story left of with teenage mercenary Sousuke Sagara continuing to fulfill missions for Mithril (the military organization), whilst protecting the teenage girl Kaname Chidori who is being targeted by other organizations. However this time round TSR focuses on a more serious storyline, full of drama.\r\nThe series beginsliterally with a bang, as the Mithril team intervene with what seems to be a civil war. This first episode is basically just to reintroduce all the characters in one incredibly action-packed episode. This is then followed by a school episode, which is full of the usual hilarious comedy that this series is loved for. However after this small amount of light-hearted comedy the story becomes mostly serious, as it focuses more on the action and drama side of things, by introducing new enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is brought about by the exciting and nerve-whacking missions, which flow well from one another. There is a good sense, with the pacing of the action, in the series because it never rushes or drags things out like many anime tend to do. The drama on the other hand is what sets TSR apart from the previous ones as it really centres on the 2 main characters; Sousuke and Kaname and how the change in their situations affected them. With that fans get to see a different side to both of them, which is a good change however because of this the other characters (namely Tessa) are somewhat neglected.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking into the animation of TSR, the one thing that comes to mind is the guys who produced it, \u201cKyoto Animation\u201d. Having the series produced by KyoAni was the best move ever as we have consistent, crystal clear visuals, with completely fluid animation. The music is nothing particularly amazing but it definitely goes well with every situation; with nice pumping beats for the action and solemn tunes to go with the dismal mood in the drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall TSR on its own could easily take the title of Best Mecha anime ever, with so much going for it like: the animation, story, the lovable characters, excitement and its appeal. Yet the fact that it\u2019s only 13 episodes long leaves so much untold and begging for a sequel. Hopefully there will be a continuation to this amazing story but for now fans will need to be contented with what is available. ^_^",

            "content": "You know, honestly, I'm not sure why Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid (TSR for short) is not ranked with a higher score than it currently has.  This show surpasses every aspect of Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, which you should be watching first for the sake of chronological order.  Like any sequel in a series, people expect the next one to deliver more than the previous, and deliver TSR has.  Even though the prequel, Fumoffu, is a great comedy between the main characters, Sousuke and Kaname,TSR does not follow suit.  Instead, think of the first series, but much better overall.\\n\\n\r\n            First off, the story is great.  For a thirteen episode series, TSR packs a lot of plot into it.  The story is continuously interesting from the very first opening scene to the last ending scene.  Again, although TSR carries a lot of it's predecessors' traits into this series, it is quite apparent from the first couple of minutes into the show that this storyline is darker than what fans may be used to.  But, don't let this deter you because it sets a serious tone which attracts your attention throughout the entire thirteen episodes.  It's not like TSR doesn't have any comedy in it, it's just that they use it more sparingly than the previous two series.  All in all though, TSR storyline is a roller coaster of emotions, which will not disappoint anyone, as it is simply fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n            What can I say about the art?  It's very good.  Again, compared to the other two series, the animation in TSR is a huge step up.  The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, and the lighting effects used in this series are awesome.  The colors are sharp and crisp, and the animation is smooth beyond belief.  Just by watching even the smallest movement in the characters, you can see the effort that was put into TSR.  This over-the-top quality animation is very apparent during the mech battles, which look just fantastic.  There are only a couple of brief instances where the animation suffers a little, but it definitely does not take anything away from the series.\\n\\n\r\n            The music and sounds in TSR are also great.  The song artist from the first two series returns, and she does not disappoint with the opening and ending themes.  Like the other openings and endings in the Full Metal Panic! series, the songs fit the tone of TSR perfectly.  The background music is great as well, as it really sets the right atmosphere depicted by the story. As for the sound effects, they are as realistic as can be, and some of them were quite unique in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n            Ah yes, the characters.  I must say that I simply love watching the characters interact with each other in the Full Metal Panic! series.  From the minor characters to the major ones, TSR will not disappoint in this department.  I kid you not; the character development in TSR is truly outstanding.  Watching the relationship between Sousuke and Kaname in this series alone has personally made them my favorite anime couple.  I definitely thought it was the most attracting part about the show, as you can really feel what they are thinking and what they are going through.  This is why you need to see the other two series before this one.  Watching these characters grow and develop in TSR gives you a roller coaster ride of emotions, and it is just fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n            Well, finally, the enjoyment factor.  To sum it up in three words: I love it.  This is how an anime should be done in every aspect.  The episodes in TSR were consistently very good, and it basically improved on everything that made Full Metal Panic! good in the first place, and turned it into something outstanding.  By the way, I am not a critic who gives out an overall score of ten very easily.  In fact, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid and only one other anime have received an overall score of ten from me.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  Just give it a try for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n:-)",

            "content": "FMP! The Second Raid\r\nOk this is an improvement from the first season but still has the same problems that makes it not enjoyable, just like in the first one and that problem is Chidori and her constant unjustified violence and other considerable problems of interaction between Sousuke and Chidori.\r\nStory\r\nThe story starts two months after the first season with a somehow changed enviroment, like if Chidori was more violent and isn't aware of the hard work Sousuke is put on by Mithril but for some reason she is bitchy towards him for not being there for her (he should be sorry for saving people) and whenhe is close to her she starts with her unjustified violence and that happens even in serious scenes where ''comedy'' is not required and i even thought she improved because of one particular ep. and therefore starting to understand Sousuke but when she reappears after what was a mature story with Sousuke as the protagonist, she blew my enjoyment, that enjoyment that could gave the anime a higher score, that enjoymen that i was having with an improved story, i was thinking that the story was much better without Chidori and just focused on Sousuke and the Mecha drama, it was a much better setting, what was the best is that Sousuke was finally asking himself what was he doing with his life? is that what he wants to keep doing? does he want to keep following orders even if he by following them couldn't protect Chidori? and i knew the story was more mature in the manga because i was spoiled that scene of what he did with that Chinese woman, it only surprised me that it wasn't adapted like it was in the manga, the thing is that Chidori ruined the story with her uncalled violence, but the story is good even with all that mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation improved a lot, more smooth and much better in general, nothing to complain about it but yeah is very good considering it was from 2005.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nBetter music and it has the same VA but more concentrated to make a great job at doing the voices; The OP is kind of like in the first season skippable and the ED was odd, it has something that made me think it was sad for some reason, it's crazy considering the clip is Sousuke and Chidori walking but with a maybe normal ED song, i don't know just that in general it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nA more improved cast of good characters but is not enough to consider the characters the strong point of the anime because if it has a particular character improvement like Sousuke then we are presented with Chidori and her same attitude, for some reason they act different, what happened in the gap time of two months from first season and second raid because is not explained why Chidori has Alzheimer with Sousuke and what he does in his daily life and why Sousuke acts like a douche with Tessa and Tessa's character was another problem, she was one of the few that i liked in the first season and now she is like almost not there and why would Sousuke say she's important to him but he doesn't show it, it's a mess, i liked that Chidori was missing Sousuke and acting like him when he was not around in one particular ep. and i thought that she was finally going to understand him and his protective persona and at that point for some reason i didn't hated her but when she finally reunites with him like i pointed before she blew it with her stupidity again, i was trying to find the reason on why she used violence with him, i can't even... The Xia twins were interesting but it wasn't enough, i wanted more of them and it was obvious who their master was when that Gates guy mocked their master and of course Melissa and Kurz are the same.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nLike i stated the enjoyment is good and even more if people don't mind a character like Chidori, not her character as the whole problem but her attitude, i can't stand that kind of character with unjustified violence and not that i don't like Tsunderes because i do but that is one of those cases that are annoying and not enjoyable at all because that ''comedy'' is not comedy for me.",

            "content": "This is probably going to be difficult to review without giving too much away,  but I'll try to keep it simple.  I'm not too used to reviewing - so bare with me here! I'll start off by saying that I absolutely adored the first series of FMP! And, to be honest, was completely overjoyed when I found out that a second season was also being released.  However, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed by the length of FMP!TSR. At a mere 13 episodes, I didn't really think that it was long enough - compared to its predecessor at ajust right episode count of 24.  But this small problem didn't stop me from actually watching the series.  But despite it's length, it certainly contains enough action.  There's a lot more going on in this second series than the first - and they still managed to do it all in a small amount of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's favorite clueless Sargent is having problems in balancing his work with Mythril, as well as his 'public' life as a sort-of bodyguard for Kaname.  As a result of this conflict, Sousuke is having difficulty in trying to balance his life between the two, but mostly it causes problems for the Mythril side of operations.  This continues on during the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe love triangle that existed in the first series and transcended into the 'spin-off' series FMP!Fumoffu is even more apparent here.  Of course, there's also Tessa the ever present captain of the Tuatha de Danaan (or Toybox).  It's quite interesting to see how the relationship between these three characters continued to develop from the first season, through to fumoffu? and then to TSR.  I won't reveal too much though.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the character development in this series is very good.  Better than in some other anime's that I have seen in this particular genre.  The animation style continues it's high standard, and is definitely no exception in this season either.  And to put the cherry on the top Mikuni Shimokawa returns to perform both the opening and closing themes of the anime.  Could you ask for anything better?  If you're a fan of the anime - or even a fan of the novels that this series is based on, I would most definitely recommend it.  I'm just hoping now that they do a third season!  As I think that this season really left some openings for a third series.  But I'll let you make your own conclusions about that.",

            "content": "As Yahtzee Croshaw once said, \"A good sequel is one that uses the original as a jumping-off point for a brand new story, while a bad sequel simply wallows in the original like a hippo in a vat of liquidized children\". Seeing as how the original Full Metal Panic was fairly mediocre, with only a particularly impressive antagonist pulling it through its inconsistency, poor characterization and bad pacing, it would have been very regrettable if The Second Raid had simply taken the latter route and rehashed the first series in an inferior format. So what a shock we're in for, as Full Metal Panic: TSRis by far superior to its predecessor in almost every way.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what helps is Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu. One of the major problems the first series had was that it kept swinging between generic highschool comedy and military action, and made no real attempt to weave it together. Overall, it would have been better if they had been two shorter series as opposed to one 24-episode one. And that is exactly what they did here. Whilst Fumoffu went about doing the highschool comedy much better than the original did, TSR does the exact same thing for the military action. Whilst TSR does have some comedy here and there, this time around it feels necessary, and gets woven into the story, rather than being some pointless distraction from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the plot does take a handful of episodes to properly kick in, it follows as such: Mithril discovers that another organisation creating chaos has similar technology to their Lambda Driver, a one-of-a-kind device that only the protagonist has the ability to use... and doesn't seem to be able to anymore. Also, rogue members of the aforementioned organisation are starting chaos in the unstable Chinese government, for an unknown \"Sensei\" of theirs. All through this, Sosuke is being put through the serious strain of protecting the \"Whispered\" Kaname Chidori, whilst maintaining his highschool fa\u00e7ade, and undertaking his regular military missions.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this, our previously annoying, personality-devoid protagonist is put between a rock and a hard place, gets forced to genuinely come into his own as a character, and rebel... and this is where the series shines. Whilst in the first season, the characters were bland, annoying, and totally devoid of development, with Sosuke being the worst, here Sosuke manages to get some extremely impressive character development turning him from perhaps the worst to the best character over the course of only a few episodes. They also manage to replace antagonist Gauron with another fantastically psychotic antagonist, Gates. Whilst Gauron was more entertainingly evil, and outright disturbed, Gates' outright psychopathy is actually played more for laughs, e.g. having his crew kill off his attackers, and then suddenly remembering he needed to extract information from them first. They play his brand of hilarious gore so well that there's never a dull moment with him on screen. This is all somewhat underplayed by the fact that Gates isn't actually that important to the plot, though. Whilst an antagonistic force is clearly in effect, Gates never really seems to effect the plot as a character, as though his personality and plot significance are two separate beings entirely. In fact, if i'm not mistaken, I don't think Gates ever speaks to a single one of the protagonists once in the entire course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd whilst we're speaking of antagonists, Gauron's motivations are finally explained here. Whilst they made little sense in the first series, they finally have some light shed on them, although they are rumouredly more fleshed out in the manga. With this given, the only truly annoying character remaining is Kaname Chidori, who manages to fall easily into the \"helpless maiden\" archetype, going through every \"Dead Teenager\" horror movie clich\u00e9 in one particular episode.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, unlike the first series, this episode cuts in at only 13 episodes, being one of those series that really leaves you wanting more. In fact, it almost feels rushed, and in some ways feels like a clich\u00e9d attempt to pull things together. To its credit, though, it manages to tie up all but a few unimportant plot threads this time... and those look as though they'll be tied up in another series anyway. We can only hope, because with this and Fumoffu under FMP's belt, it's definitely worth watching the first series just to get to this.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Frankly, one of the best anime sequels, if not the best, that i've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 4/10\\n\r\nEnglish Dub: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "After finishing watching The Second Raid (TSR) around 20 minutes ago, I was left with a feeling of fulfillment anime rarely ever gives me these days. As an action series it's hard to fault: the action was enjoyable to watch, helped by the high production values, and it had a strong cast of characters that painted over the simplicity of the story. It did everything it needed to do right and ticked all of my boxes, meeting my overly critical standards.\r\nThis wasn't the case with the original FMP series, though. Back when I watched that I was left a bit underwhelmed by an experience I'dexpected to be a lot more enjoyable than it turned out to be. The constant switching between school comedy and anti-terrorism/mecha action let it down, interrupting the flow and making it difficult to get into the serious episodes. And, with the quality of the serious stories and comedy varying from decent to very good, the quality of the content wasn't enough save a series suffering from an identity crisis. I gave it 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first series, someone with a brain obviously decided it would be a better idea to separate the serious and comedy elements into two series, removing the problems caused by the conflicting genres. The comedy side of things got its very own series first in the way Fumoffu and, as you'd expect, lots of school insanity involving Sagara and Kaname followed. It worked out far better without any robot goings on getting in the way, helped by the comedy scenes being far more funny than most of those shown in the original series. I gave it 8/10, but I would've probably scored it higher if not for my sense of humour failure.\\n\\n\r\nTSR, which came out after Fumoffu, did the reverse and focused on the anti-terrorism side. I wasn't really sure what to expect after ending up disappointed with the more serious sections of the original series, not even the high ratings making me confident. I only got around to watching it after I saw and won an auction for the art box + entire series on eBay.co.uk, the motivation not having been there after finishing Fumoffu many months earlier. But, when I did finally get around to watching it, I found myself struggling to find faults, and even the faults I found were only relatively minor things, such as the use of abbreviations without any explanations being given.\\n\\n\r\nAs you'd expect with TSR being an action series, the story wasn't memorable. The threat of civil war appears, Mythril send out Arm Slaves to intervene, the threat of war is averted and the cycle starts anew. Mixed in is an organization called Amalgam that creates wars to test out weapons and profits from doing so. None of it is hard to understand or what I'd consider to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what made TSR better than most other action series? The characters. Since most watchers would've viewed the previous FMP series before getting into this, most of the character introductions and basic development wasn't necessary, leaving more than enough time for the new characters to get introduced and allowing for the already established characters to get additional development. Talking of new additions, the new characters were pretty good, the insane new villain Gates and a pair of sexy Chinese twins being the best of the lot.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, The Sagara/Kaname relationship received the most time and, as a result, was the strongest non-action point of the series. I came to like/love/want to sex Kaname far more by the end, the determination and emotions shown by her raising my opinion of her even higher than it was prior to watching. Sagara, on the other hand, was more hit and miss: I hated him for a lengthy period of TSR for being a coward, but I did end up warming up to him towards the end; when the interaction between the two resumed. The one consistent thought that ran through my mind when watching Sagara was that without Kaname around him he's neither likable nor very interesting...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't help but rate TSR highly. It successfully pleased someone hard to please, meaning it's a show that I'm sure the majority of anime fans out there that haven't got around to watching it yet would love to bits. Looking for a short and high quality action/mecha series? If so, this is for you.",

            "content": "When Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu aired many fans questioned whether or not the then unknown animation studio Kyoto Animation (Kyoani) would be up to the task.  It was pretty obvious that they were and after establishing themselves with the otakun community with Air: TV it was clear they were a force to be reckoned with.  Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid (FMP: TSR) the direct sequel of Full Metal Panic! (FMP) would be their next project and in the end became a worthy sequel.  Perhaps FMP:TSR could even be considered to be superior to the first FMP.\r\nFMP: TSR story/structure can be easilydescribed by its opening and ending.  The opening, Minami Kaze is a song that features hardship yet remains optimistic for the future while, accompanying primarily military/mecha scenes.  Where as the ending, Mou Ichido Kimi ni Aitai is a somber piece about 2 lover separated and wish to meet again.  This song is accompanied with shots of an empty school and Sagara and Chidori walking together.  The opening is distinctly representative of the first half of FMP: TSR as there is quite a bit of fact paced action.  Easily some of the best &lsquo;light&rsquo; military action scenes I&rsquo;ve seen.  In addition, there is a bit of military drama but it never gets too heavy.  Mou Ichido Kimi ni Aitai, the ending song is best representative of the 2nd half.  FMP: TSR takes a more serious turn focusing on the character drama between Sagara and Chidori, in particular Sagara.  Both halves were very good in their right however, the transition between them could have been better.  The beginning was very story driven but suddenly ends up character driven.\\n\\n\r\nMany of my complaints for the first Full Metal Panic! still apply.  All of the villains are extremely flat, Gates isn&rsquo;t much more than a crazed lunatic and the Xia sisters are pretty boring albeit badass.  They did introduce another villain that should to prove interesting in the next Full Metal Panic&rsquo;s.  There are also a few plot holes/inconsistencies that can be annoying.  The use of comedy, one of FMP best parts felt a bit awkward the beginning of FMP: TSR.  In particular, the 2nd episode, it felt like they were forcing the comedy in-between story segments.  Thankfully, the balance was found later on in the series.         \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, once again similar to the first FMP, they are pretty interesting and fun to watch.  However, what really separates FMP: TSR and FMP! would be the more serious character drama in the 2nd half of the series.  This part was extremely well done and gives Sagara the much needed character depth and growth.   I&rsquo;ll stop now for fear of spoiling any more.  Let me just say that for the next FMP&rsquo;s  this is easily one of the biggest things I&rsquo;m looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe one part that FMP: TSR really improves upon would be the animation/art.  Action was extremely fluid and well choreographed.  They were among the best mecha action scenes I&rsquo;ve seen in any anime.  In addition, many of the actions scenes are extremely fun to watch, as it never got too gritty/realistic.  Art was equally good and consistant.  Overall, Kyoani truly deserve the reputation they have for high quality animation/art.  Music, was good, but nothing really note worthy.\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Panic: The Second Raid features an action packed beginning with bits of drama.  Actions scenes are among the best I&rsquo;ve seen and the art/animation is of the highest quality, as expected of Kyoani.  However, the 2nd half takes a more serious turn, focusing on character drama between Sagara and Chidori, in particular Sagara.  This darker more serious turn is was really separates itself from the first Full Metal Panic!  In addition, this gives Sagara the much needed character depth and growth.  The transition between the 2 halves could have been done better as it feels a bit too much of a jump between the story driven first half and the character driven second half.  Also, the villains were a bit flat, with the exception of one who should prove interesting in the upcoming Full Metal Panic&rsquo;s.  However, these complaints can&rsquo;t take away from the fact that Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid is an enjoyable watch featuring excellent actions scenes and character drama.  Now where&rsquo;s the sequel?",

            "content": "Sleek animation, adrenalin pumping action, and a great plot containing many twists and turns, I really should have enjoyed this more than I did. I lay the blame on one of my friends, who hyped it up way too much for me. I mean, there is no doubt that \"Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid\" is very good show, but it's no where near the best anime ever, or even one of the best, like my friend had claimed.\r\n\"The Second Raid\" is a generally good all-round anime that succeeds very well at what it tries to do, which is to be a kick ass actiondriven show. Nevertheless, it contains some flaws, and lacks that certain I-don't-know-what that distinguishes something that's one of the greats from something that's just another great anime. It's the kind of aura that makes you love it even when it's uber hyped. \"Berserk\" has it, even though incompleteness marred the series badly; \"Full Metal Alchemist\" has it enough to overcome my general hate for anime comedy. \"The Second Raid\" however, doesn't have \"it\".\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation, \"The Second Raid\" is almost impeccable. Wonderfully rich colours and clean artwork combines with the great CG makes this an absolute treat for the eyes. The only problem is, the characters look so great for the most part that Chidori's slightly exaggerated character design (inherited from the original series) that reflects her rather loud, brash personality seems out of place when everything else looks so perfect. This kind of thing is reflected in the content of the anime too. \"The Second Raid\" is mostly serious, and when it is serious, it is for the most part, really good. But occasionally they try to slip in some comedy, and it just doesn't work as it well as it does in previous series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well executed, and contains enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, but there's nothing that extraordinary about it, nothing you've not seen a couple of times before from somewhere. I still remember the desert mission from the original series, but I barely remember anything from \"The Second Raid\". In addition, there still doesn't seem to be much information on certain enigmas such as the whispered etc that's left unexplained in the first season. Whether this is because Kyoto Animation didn't feel like wiping Gonzo's arse after them as they took over the franchise following season 1, or whether it's because the answers to those mysteries are still not revealed in the source material, I can only speculate.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the characters makes and breaks this show. My friend especially like the way they developed Sousuke out of his box personality in \"The Second Raid\", and though it didn't quite have the same amount of affect on me, I can certainly see what he was getting at. Chidori also gets some nice development, as the extreme back-to-the-wall circumstances she faces in the series brings out a steely quality in her character. Thankfully, they are the central characters of the franchise, so the fact that they are good weighs heavily in the favour of this anime, which is just as well, because the side characters aren't all that.\\n\\n\r\nLike with the first season, I really feel the need to let off some steam with a \"Tessa rant\". \"Watch TSR, then you'll see why Tessa makes such a good captain,\" my friend told me, in response to when I said a character like Tessa being captain is absurd. It's true that during one incident in this particular series Tessa shows some backbone, but it's also true that previous to the incident she does something that makes her look like the lovesick little girl that she is. It also speaks volumes when her subordinate are all so surprised that she could show such backbone... such faith they place in their commanding officer :P It pretty much proves my point about her lack of presence. A certain conversation between Tessa and her superior indicated that her superior also habours doubts about her ability to be captain, but that she had insisted. So let me get this straight - her superior didn't think she was suitable, and yet he still let her be captain just cos that is what she wanted?? Are they suppose to be a military organisation or a nursery?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't forget the new fanservice characters. In addition to Tessa, they've now added a pair of Chinese twin sisters. In case being lesbians ain't servicing the fans enough, they've also thrown in some incest action for good measure. The fact that they were originally male in the source material speaks for itself, really. Then we have the villain. Clearly they're trying to make the most crazy villain ever here. Perhaps they succeeded, but for me they've gone a bit overboard with it. The effort of making him crazy purely for the sake of craziness just made him seem waaay too weird for my liking, not to mention annoying.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the previous series, \"The Second Raid\" features some nice jpop opening/ending themes and background music. Here's something interesting: I was listening to my iPod, and mistook the background music from \"Full Metal Panic\" for the epic sound track off \"Gundam Seed\". Not such a surprise once I found out that Sahashi Toshihiko is the composer behind both. Just listening to the sound track, it's hard to distinguish between the two anime, but while watching the anime, I found the music in \"Gundam Seed\" to be a lot more powerful and memorable. I guess it just goes to show that the music and the contents of the anime can be mutually influencing, and that \"Full Metal Panic\" just isn't as epic as \"Gundam Seed\". \\n\\n\r\nThe one major complaint I have with the otherwise great sound production is the wooden Chinese spoken in the anime (\"The Second Raid\" takes place in China). In fact, it seems like a general trend that foreign language spoken by natives in anime sounds flat. I'm guessing that one reason might be because it's not worth the effort looking for native speakers with voice acting credentials just for the purpose of voicing extras, and so they just end up pulling ordinary people off the streets to voice these roles... and surprise surprise they turn out not to be very good at it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil the last episode, I was prepared to rate this higher than the first season, as I was quite enthralled by the numerous turn of events, but the last episode is very weak. Sousuke's conversation with his mecha is just so... cheesey... there's just no other term for it, as much as I dislike using that word. That attempt at light humour totally falls flat on its face. I did rather like the ending involving Sousuke and Chidori, but I suspect what one guy said about their relationship most likely returning to their static state eventually to be true. After all, that is the main attraction of the whole franchise, and at the very least, it's something that \"Full Metal Panic\" does consistently well.",

            "content": "Picture the scene: A rainy night on top of a love hotel. A girl wearing nothing but a tattered dressing gown is down on her knees. She\u2019s been sexually assaulted and just had to watch someone be choked to death. Shivering with her arms wrapped around her, she casts her face towards the sky, tears and rain dripping down her face, and screams \u201cWHHHHYYYYYYYYY\u201d. Fade to black, roll end of episode credits.\r\nThis is a thing that happens in The Second Raid. I get that you wanted to get serious this season after Fumoffu, but there\u2019s serious and there\u2019s surgically removing all the fun from afranchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second Raid is a huge angst-fest, growing an emo-fringe down to its knees as characters throw aside their regular characterisation to shiver and moan and agonise over the pain of existence. Sagara, the once straight talking, straight shooting male lead, goes down the path of alcohol and hookers. He regards the death of his comrades with cold apathy. He starts following the cult of nihilism, asking what is the point in living on this gay earth anymore. I get that they\u2019re trying to communicate to us that he just really cares about Kaname and doesn\u2019t want to be apart from her, but there has to be a better way to demonstrate this that doesn\u2019t involve beating up repeatedly with the frying pan of angstyness. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s another way we can understand his pain without it being so tedious and irritating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe new villains in this arc, brought upon by this shift in tone, are equally terrible. The Chinese assassin twins are where most of the horribleness revolves around. They\u2019re the main recipients of the anime\u2019s new turn into the Violence and Tits arena, and it comes off as immature at best and exploitative and worst. Particularly when you consider there\u2019s tits everywhere while they too are contemplating the pain of their existence and them being raped by their new boss. The violence usually surrounds them too, with shots of things like spinal columns poking out the top of slit necks and things like that. It\u2019s not saying anything with the violence and sexuality either. With the tone of TSR, it comes off as trying to appear hardcore.\\n\\n\r\nThe leader of the military group in TSR deserves credit for making me appreciate the first season\u2019s Gauron a whole lot more. I\u2019d always thought Gauron was a bit crazy and psychotic and wondered why people kept funding him, but at least Gauron didn\u2019t randomly shoot dudes in the face who were on his team. At least Gauron was capable of holding a conversation enough for a deal to go through. You only realise Gauron\u2019s insanity when you get up close and look into his eyes when he makes a near suicidal decision, but up until then you can see why someone would follow his orders. His obsession with Sagara gave him some actual depth. The lunatic in TSR, on the other hand, is nothing more than a lunatic. What\u2019s most bizarre is the show seemed to be trying to play up his lunacy as comedy. His actions are so cartoony and exaggerated  it feels like he belongs in a totally different anime to the otherwise oppressive angst that the rest of the show has.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is also nonsensical. Sagara\u2019s story with Kaname is the main draw here, and that at least makes sense, if admittedly tonally off. The actual terrorism committed in this show is way stupider though. Asides from random nothings like \u201chey, lets introduce Tessa\u2019s brother like it\u2019s no big deal, and then do absolutely fuck all with him\u201d, the entire mission in the second half revolves around two depressed Chinese twins following the orders of a psychotic cripple as they escape from a lunatic scientist who rapes them when he\u2019s not shooting his subordinates in the face, all for the incredibly roundabout purpose of getting Sagara to walk into a single building. That\u2019s leaving aside the fact that somehow that guy managed to survive a self-destruct sequence inside his own robot with several tons of explosives right out in the middle of the ocean. I know he\u2019s supposed to give off this Terminator-vibe, but that\u2019s just silly. I\u2019m choosing to believe that he was just a figment of Sagara\u2019s depressed imagination. The plot arguably makes more sense that way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this more depressing (for me that is, because I\u2019m not sure the tone of TSR could get more depressed) is that there\u2019s clearly a better show here. Kyoto Animation\u2019s production quality and general shine is light-years ahead of anything Gonzo ever did, even accounting for the 3 years advances in animation technology KyoAni had. Shame that they put this talent into something so angsty and hardcore. This sounds especially weird coming from me, who could not give a rats ass about anything KyoAni make nowadays because of their devotion to the bible of cute, but badly made hardcore angst is just as tedious as shallow cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nThing is, there are two episodes in the middle of TSR that are amazing. It has a fantastic chase sequence through some town in Sicily where Kurz, Mao and Sagara try to escape the mafia in a crappy little car, which has that brilliant quality of any great chase sequence in that events keep spiralling up and become more dramatic as it goes on. Then that episode is followed by easily the best scene in the entire FMP canon: The haircut scene. Its remarkable in its low-key simplicity. Wonderfully directed, with pregnant pauses and great sound design and a closeness to it that captures fantastically how much Sagara and Kaname feel safe around each other, with so much being said with so little. Its perfection hurts, with makes it that much more disappointing when the rest of the show careers off into angst-town.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026now where\u2019s season 3 damnit.",

Story begins from three months after the original FMP.\r\nStory:\r\nStory was good and overall better balanced than in first series. Story was rather quick because of limidet episode quantity. I feel that story would have been maybe better if they had made few more episodes but it was good even now. This one had less humour and darker athmosphere than first one but I actually liked it. It felt somehow better and better fitted for this series.\r\nArt:\r\nThis in one thing that I loved the most in this series. Art and drawing arereally awesome. You wont notice bad detailed parts like in some marathon series (Naruto, Bleach etc.) Everything is really precisely done and the animation studio has really put effort to this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound and the sountrack was overall good. Nothing earthbreaking but they fitted well in the series and its athmosphere. Nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters were easely likable and overall there were something for everyone. Most of the characters were from the first series but some new ones made their first appereance. The new bad guy Gates was well done and very unique. Overall new characters fitted well in the story and I didn't hate anyone. It is good sign if you don't dislike any character. It means they are done well. This one had more character development too. Sousuke really stardet to think something other than military and I liked that change. It made him feel moore natural.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. It had good mix of action, drama and humour.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked this anime very much. everything was so well made that this sucked me truly with it. Only complain is the episode quantity. 13 is really small amount for anime. I highly recommend this anime even if you don't like mecha. \\n\\n",

I know that can be a factor of me just liking the look of new anime moor, but I think this still looks worse then some anime during that time or before it. but, the animation in the second season looks spectacular and still holds up to this day\r\nthe story is a lot better then the firs and it seems a lot less repetitive.I think the reason for this is because the characters deal with more internal conflicts now. The protagonist seems less of a blank slate in this season then he did in the last season. and i feel like some of the side characters are actually decent now. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is still the same as the first one i think\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are way better this season. the villain has a more bombastic personality and i like watching him, and the other new characters are good as well. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show and would recommend it. i myself am not much of a mech fan so if i can watch it then most people can to. its also a great introduction to mech series.",

            "content": "The Darkest FMP! Series To Date: \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is defiantly strong, it picks off well from where the first series left off, and has a good pacing speeding up/slowing down when necessary, There isn't a single filler episode in this series, and I felt that after every episode I watched that the plot or the characters had developed a little; which is obviously very positive. I won't talk too much about the story itself so not to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet, but it is defiantly a good continuation of the first series\r\n9/10\r\nArt:\r\nFMP! has always had it's own distintive art style,the animation is certainly superb; the moment the intro sequence begins you know you are in for something special and the attention to detail really makes for a realistic setting, the fight scenes are especially good and the blood looks really realistic, the settings are much darker than the other two series and really adds to the overall tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNo anime series is complete without a good OST, and this series defiantly doesn't let up in this department. From fantastic opening and ending songs to fantastic mood music, the whole score sounds perfect and really seems to fit well with where it's put, whether it's low sounding beats for mysterious scenes or softer songs for more delacit moments, there's never a moment when the music seems irregular or out of place\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters have always been my favourite part of the FMP! series, but this series sees more development than the first two combined. Never have we seen Sousuke more emotional or Kaname more helpless, there were genuine moments when I was on the edge of my seat to see what happens next between them. Not only does there relationship develop, but also Sousuke as a character, he defiantly seems like he's grown up alittle by the end of the series and is ready to live life the way he wants to, which is a message that applies to us all.  Appearances from the ever perverted Kurtz and the strong willed Melissa just help add to the character side with Sousuke experiencing different emotions around the both of them. The new villians introduced were excellent and worked on so many levels, there more violent nature really made the series alot darker than I imaged it would be, and really had character that made them stand out as memorable villians.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Well that's a combination of everything above really, the fact I was a big fan before this series just meant that I was hyped as hell waiting and then watching this series, and seeing some more development between the characters I love really made it a worthwhile watch, but to fully enjoy it you defiantly have to atleast seen the first series (the second series, being a spin off, is briefly referred to in scenes but not in relevence to the plot). \\n\\n\r\nI'm a harsh critic so I very rarely hand out 10s, but this series really ticked all the boxes it had to and defiantly exceeded all expectations, I'd reccomend watching this if you watched and enjoyed the first two series, be warned this one is more violent and does contain a few bloody scenes.",

            "content": "Fans of the original Full Metal Panic will find more of exactly what they loved about the first season with Full Metal Panic the 2nd Raid.  The show really doesn\u2019t deviate from what made the first season a success, and even manages to build onto that a bit.\r\nStory:  I won\u2019t go into the specifics of the story, but the second season seems to focus less on the dangers to Chidori and instead focuses more on Sousuke\u2019s life as a soldier as well as some new enemies he will have to face.  As with the first series, I\u2019ve always thought that FMP isweaker when it tries to focus on the mecha and military aspect of the show.  I think the heart of the show is the comedy that usually goes with the pairing of Sousuke and Chidori, and since this season seems to be more focused on the military aspect, I think it loses something for that.  On the flip side, there is a lot of growth for the characters in this season, particularly Sousuke who you really wind up liking more by end of the season.  The enemies in this particular season are hit or miss, as I enjoyed the twin sisters as villains, but found myself utterly annoyed with the crazy bastard they\u2019ve setup as the main villain.  Despite the fact that I think the show once again strays from its real heart and lacks a truly enjoyable antagonist, it\u2019s still a great season overall and one that fans of the series will love none the less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  I\u2019ve already talked a bit about Chidori and Sousuke.  Chidori doesn\u2019t seem to grow as much in this season as does Sousuke, although she faces some challenges and she has some of the best moments in the entire show.  This season is really about Sousuke, his growth as a person beyond his military career and his feelings towards Chidori.  I think the best scene in the entire season is the haircut scene, which ironically other people have chided for being too slow.  That scene really shows the growth of their relationship and again, these two and their relationship is the real core of this show, so the better that is, the better the show is overall.  The side characters pretty much all take a back seat in this season though, as almost none of the classmates are even seen, and even Mao and Kurz have very minor roles, but largely that\u2019s due to the shortened season I believe.  \\n\\n\r\nPresentation:  Overall, there isn\u2019t anything to really complain about when it comes to the visuals and audio of FMP.  The animation is solid and the music is all around pretty good.  The only downside is that nothing really stands out in either area.  The people are all rather bland in terms of anime characters, and the robots are easily among the blandest mecha I\u2019ve ever seen period.  It makes sense within the confines of the show that you\u2019d want them to be realistic looking, but they don\u2019t need to be downright boring looking.  In the end, the presentation isn\u2019t anything to detract from the show, it just doesn\u2019t add anything great to it either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  This is where FMP really shines and picks up most of its score with me.  Despite the fact that I still think the show waddles in the middle of doing anything in particular exceptionally, it still manages to be really enjoyable.  The fight scenes are fun, if not spectacular and the comedy portions are still hysterical.  Despite not finding anything in particular to really draw me into FMP, I still found myself loving this season.  I think the reason that everyone loves this show is that it has some distinct charm, and that goes a long way.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, FMP: 2nd Raid is another good season to a good show.  I can\u2019t classify it as great, as I think that there are shows out there that handle each of its respective parts better.  But as a blending of high school comedy and mecha action shows, it works incredibly well.  And it\u2019s just a charming show that you always find yourself loving.  Fans of FMP won\u2019t need to be told to watch this season, so for everyone else, I can only say that if you give it a shot, this will probably win you over.",

Heck I enjoyed it, I thought it was clever, funny, suspenseful and terribly entertaining. However when it came to the end I was happy to move on with my life expecting it to be over (I'm used to one series anime). I really regret waiting those three years to watch the second raid. \r\nThe storyline (in which it really is essential that you have watched the first series) relies less on the meccha action side and really focusses on character development. Souske finallystarts showing emotions and that is the part that had me wishing that every episode was that little bit longer. One of the main plot points revolves around Souske being forbidden to contact Kaname in any way shape or form and these episodes were really fascinating. Seeing Kaname suffer through abandonment made you feel something for the both of them and that's what makes a moving piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nMy one and only dissapointment was that they introduced some new and really interesting characters (Gates, Xia Yu Lan, Xia Yu Fan and Leonard Testarossa especially) that I really wish had some more screen time. Although the series was more dramatic because of the 13 episode run which meant it could really focus on the main plot it also means we get less time understanding these new characters. Maybe a few more couldn't hurt?\\n\\n\r\nThe Full Metal Panic series, be it the first run, Fumoffu or The Second Raid has a little bit of everything in for everyone no matter what their tastes are. I only hope they continue to make a fourth series because they know how to hit every mark right.",

            "content": "And the panic keeps going, it seems. I was not too fond of the first series, nor the Fumoffu comedy, but this actually was quite ok. I really wanted to like the earlier FMP stuff, and at last something cood came up.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nFlawless as usual from this title. It's basically the same as in the earlier incarnations, but with better animated fighting scenes and a little bit more gore. Character design and backgrounds are as great as always. Top notch!\r\nSound\t\r\nThe FMP titles have always had nice intro/outro songs, and this is no exception, although I must say it is worse than 1nd season and Fumoffu. Stillnice music.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a bit irritated over Chidori's constant screaming, but overall the voice acting feels genuine. Not that I speak japanese, so I wouldn't know. The feeling is good, though.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nThe story focuses almost entirely on Sosuke this time, which means lots of mecha action and less of the school life. I guess we all got enough of that in Fumoffu. Still, I think the big potential FMP has, is the tension between Sosuke and Chidori and much of that risked getting lost in the Second Raid. It turned out ok, since  much of the story is about his confusion having to choose between duty and the lass.\\n\\n\r\nThe more combat-oriented story is quite good, with some cool intrigues and a couple of twists. A couple of things felt wierd, and really twisted to get the story going. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a more than decent story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nSosuke is finally starting to feel like at least part human, rather than a war droid. His increasing affection towards Chidori is confusing him, making him queston his role. Interesting.\\n\\n\r\nChidori is as stubborn and loud as ever, but as we have seem before, she actually likes Sosuke. Sometimes this shines through, and these times she is really cute. She doesn't add much to the story herself, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are cool, I didn't get what that blonde boy was all about (I suppose he'll come back in a later FMP), but the twin girls and the crazy boss were great in their own ways. The crazy guy was actually one of the best villains I have ever seen in an anime, almost as good as Papacha from \"Photon\".\\n\\n\r\nSosuke's comrades-in-arms are... well, they are also great. Teresa gets a little more screen time, which is nice. I like her, she is such a paradox.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nI probably won't watch this again in a long time, but it made me feel like watching the 1st season again just to check out some background fluff. It probably will make me disappointed again, just as it did the first time. Doesn't change the fact that I actually liked this anime, though.",

            "content": "This third season of Full Metal Panic \"The Second Raid\" is probably my favorite of the three. It's definitely the most competently made: It has fantastic action sequences, an interesting plot and features much better pacing, animation and characterizations! The military stuff in this one is actually pretty damn good and\ufeff it's balanced much better with the\ufeff show's campier side which is hilarious as ever!\r\nOn the dramatic side of things: Sousuke and Kaname's relationship is pushed to its limits when they're unwillingly split up! In one heartbreaking scene Kaname calls out for Sousuke's help, but for the first time in the series - Sousuke isnot there for her. It gets very tense and you really feel for both of them during their lonesome struggles! They're obviously deeply in love but neither is willing to admit it to one another, which is of course one of the reason why we love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite scene of the whole season is where Kaname cuts Sousuke's hair. It's perfectly written, perfectly acted (at least in the English dub) and perfectly directed. I've never been into shipping much, but Kaname and Sousuke are hands down my favorite anime couple of all time so this scene was very sweet and satisfying! For all the REAL shippers out there - This is probably the closest thing we'll get to a sex-scene with these two! \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season you're left wanting more and saddened that Kyoto Animation cant figure out how to continue the anime... I award \"The Second Raid\" a glowing 9/10 - It's an excellent (if slightly unforfilling) end to one of the best and funniest anime series ever conceived! \\n\\n\r\nNOW BRING ON SEASON 4 ALREADY!",

However i am still amazed of how good its story is, and even through i am one of does guys who DO NOT LIKE MECHA ANIME I STILL LOVE THIS SHOW.\r\nOne of the reason for my love of the Full Metal Panic Franchies, can be that its one of the few anime`sout there, with a very strong female lead, even compared to today. I can`t think of a show with a female lead, as unique as Kaname Chidori from this show. On the other site we have Tessa, Sosukes captain, that have to take extreamly hard desition, and put her own situation aside, to support our main characters, even though it is emotional hard for her. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is alot more action packed than season 1, and it tells a far better story, and expants the universe just like a good sequel should do. At the same times it keeps its humor high, while still stepping into some emotional territory and it is doing it got damn good. I would say that my enjoyment of this was outstanding, compared to the first season, and one of the reason may be that it was some good and packed 13 episodes i was provided with.\\n\\n\r\nI am in such love with the Characters that i have to give it 10/10, i don`t know if its nostalgia that let me think so high of this serie, but it just hits me like a wrecking ball.",

            "content": "\"Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid\" (TSR) is a wast improvement to it\u00b4s prequel \"Full Metal Panic!\" (FMP). It\u00b4s not often the sequel surpasses the prequel, but in this case it really does - in every category. I did enjoy the first part, but it contained many things that could been done better (better pacing, better character interactions, better music and so on). So what made \"TSR\" so much better in my eyes? I will get down to that now. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is picking up two months after the events \"FMP\", so you have to watch the first part to understand what\u00b4s happening. InTSR we get more of the things that was so good in \"FMP\". It contains more action (mostly really nice mecha fights), connected to Mithrils missions. And in TSR you can start to see a red thread in this missions. Something is starting be clear - it\u00b4s not just random events but a enemy group (Amalgam) is actually behind most of the situations that Mithril has to take care of. Amalgams objectives also starts to come into the light, which makes the whole story much more compelling to me (love evil arch enemies with more objectives then just being evil). The story also takes a bit more serious tone (don\u00b4t worry, its still a lot of comedy involved), which suites the situations more and made me feel more for the characters. The interaction between many characters was also much better, which deepened the bond between them more (HUGE plus). It made me feel a whole a lot more for them in this 13 episodes then all the other 26. The pacing was much more even (not 2-3 intense ones and 4-5 slow ones), the flow between more action toned episodes and story filling toned episodes felt much more balanced. The only thing I\u00b4m missing is more info about the \"whispered\". It\u00b4s a build up for a continuation, but so far a new season hasn\u00b4t been announced. But it\u00b4s much more source material, so I guess I have to dig in to the manga now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nFor a 2005 production the art and animation is great! It also a significant improvement to the prequel. The colors, motions, light setting and so on looks really good. The backgrounds and the details of them are amazing - really liked that they have put so much time and money in them. The mechas never seems out of place, which they sometimes can do in other anime. The characters look the same but have got an upgrade in quality and coloring. Overall very much to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThank god that they did something drastic about the soundtrack! The soundtrack to FMP sounded much like something to a 90\u00b4s action cartoon (hated it). But  the soundtrack to TSR are much more pleasing and suiting to the feeling of the anime - MEGA plus. OP and ED was also really good. A more up beat OP and a more slow and emotional ED. For VA (I watched the dubbed), I think most of them did a good job of catching the core of the character and how they expresses them self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nFor starters I can say I like most of the cast. They have a broad variety of personalities and backgrounds. Most characters don\u00b4t feel shallow or boring. They all have personal traits and way of acting. Most of their emotions and expression of them is relatable and logical. The interaction between the characters also gained a new level, both in comical situations and more serious ones. That made the whole experiences of TSR that much more greater for me. The main characters had a lot more development in this season, compared to the first. We are also introduced to new characters, both allies and enemies. The most entertaining of them for me was the psycho villain dude and the psycho (incestious?) twin sisters. They shore made their impact on the story. We are also introduced to a new major player form the Amalgam organization, who has close connection with one in the top of Mithril. He really peaked my interest.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked a lot is that we get to know more about Sousukes past, which highly explains way he is like and acts like he does. He also developed much during TSR. He goes from being the stiff and non questioning soldier, to being more human that can feel and express emotions. He also starts to think about how he want to live his life, and starts to become aware of his feelings for Kaname. Kaname is still her old loud and violent self, but is tested raver hard when she is left alone and have to fend for her self. But that makes her grow and become even stronger - the girl is a survivor for shore. She also starts to realize her feeling for Sousuke but don\u00b4t really have the guts to tell him how she feels. And my girl Major Melissa Mao. Always a pleasure to see her do her thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed myself watching TSR! I watched in two days, that\u00b4s saying something. I had high hopes for it after reading some very positive reviews on it, and I wasn\u00b4t the least disappointed - I agree to the letter. I was intrigued, excited and almost couldn\u00b4t wait to click forth next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nBAAM! Now we talking. Now I\u00b4m totally on the \"Full metal panic!\" hype train. A good balanced pace and mix of action, drama and comedy made this ride awesome for me. Add to that the show got a bit of more serious tone, which I think it\u00b4s suited for and we got some good character development. If you are into mechas with a loads of comedy and drama with some hints of romance - well this is the shit for you.",

            "content": "If you haven't watched the original Full Metal Panic! series, you should watch it before watching The Second Raid, because it's the sequel to the original series. In regards to Fumoffu?, you don't have to watch it before TSR.\r\nWith that away, let's get to reviewing. The story in TSR easily surpasses any 13-episode show I've watched as of writing this review. The pacing varies a bit; suddenly this and that happens and then it's done quickly, and you may be left baffled ), but some scenes are very slow, like the scene when Chidori cut Sousuke's hair. Some may not like that, but I thinkthat the pace was just right at the right moments, and that it created just the kind of mood the scene needed. \\n\\n\r\nTSR moves a bit away the funny high school life of Chidori and Sousuke, leaving the room for more drama and a couple of episodes focusing on Chidori and Sousuke's emotional struggles with themselves and each other after certain events happen. However, it preserves a bit of the great high school humor you're probably familiar with by now, especially in the earlier episodes. The story was excellent in my opinion, and the only thing that drags it down is the rather loose ending; it seems like things aren't over yet. There are also small bits of fanservice here and there, just so you're warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is, to quote a friend of mine, &quot;unreal&quot;. I thought the quality of the original series was excellent, but this just blew me right out of the water. The coloring is vivid, and the level of detail in the backgrounds is very good. The Special effects are very good too, and the lighting effects are astounding. In fact, the best I've seen. The detail of screens and monitors is incredible, too. Shortly summarized, the animation quality is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a vast improvement from the original series. The OP and ED themes are as good as ever, and songs I'd listen to over and over again. The background music is incredible, too. The pieces are great to listen to, and they fit right in with the mood, and amplify it. The tense music during Chidori's episode was the best when it came to setting the mood, if you ask me. The sound effects are nothing I can say bad things about either, from birds chirping to explosion sounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have gotten a lift, too. Of course, it's the characters we have learned to love, and now they're getting some good character development. Especially on Chidori and Sousuke's part. I really liked how they portrayed Chidori's feelings towards Sousuke, and in the finale episodes, Sousuke changed a lot. He's slowly turning into a human and not just a stiff guy who acts only on orders. Throw in a hilariously paranoid bad guy as well as two messed-up twin sisters, and it's perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really, really enjoyed The Second Raid, but I do hope there's more Full Metal Panic! to come.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "It is fairly uncommon for a sequel to excel over the original in virtually every way possible. That is, typically, even if the sequel is mostly superior, there are often a few noticeable elements missing from it which made the original enjoyable (A personal example would be Batman Begins and The Dark Knight). Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid (TSR), on the other hand, is one of these rare instances of a sequel surpassing its predecessor in all respects.\r\nAll around, The Second Raid has a better plot, better scripting, better character development, better action, better humor, and better animation. To get a good idea aboutthe essence of The Second Raid, simply imagine a tighter, darker, more focused, serious, and mature series which takes all of the good and worthwhile elements from the original and improves on them. In a nutshell, this is Full Metal Panic: The Grown-Up Version.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, what The Second Raid does remarkably well is genuinely challenge its characters, not only physically and psychologically, but also morally. Unlike much of the tactical action sequences of the first season, the sense of danger and isolation is now much more real, as well as enemies which are genuine threats and not simply a string of forgettable,  one-dimensional \"terrorist/bad guys\" (Takima Kugayama and his \"sister\" from the first series) or anonymous henchmen to be easily defeated. For a more specific contrast, think of the scene from the original Full Metal Panic where Melissa Mao, armed with only a rifle, taunts and entire troop of hostiles from a rooftop, with no cover, apparently not the least bit concerned about being shot, despite the fact that half a dozen enemy arm slaves have their guns trained on her. On the other hand, simply seeing TSR's brutal and effective killing machines, the Xia twins, in action should be enough to realize that the days of relatively easy and unrealistic victories are over.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, our heroic protagonist Souske Sagara, who was previously a fairly single-minded \"military maniac\" with very little sense of self-doubt, now finds himself actually having to ask the important, life-changing questions, namely, who am I? What am I doing? Is what I am doing right? and more specifically, Do I like doing nothing but following orders? Do I like being surrounded by weak people who constantly need me for support?--All questions which the first series never dares to ask. As an example, a particularly memorable and extremely well-written phone conversation occurs between Souske and the mysterious MITHRIL intelligence agent, Wraith, in which he is for the first time forced to deal with the actual consequences of his inability to adapt to civilian life--thus the series' oft-used and never-questioned \"comic relief\" device quickly and seamlessly turns into  an opportunity for some very interesting and dramatic character development. It is also impressive the way in which the writers subtly work in a couple references to the seemingly insignificant events from Fumoffu . Later on we also get to witness firsthand what happens to Kaname when Souske is no longer there to protect her. The results are equally as enticing.\\n\\n\r\nThis motif applies not only to the characters, but MITHRIL as an organization itself. In TSR, we are no longer simply expected to believe that a mercenary organization which acts as some kind of a non-partisan global police force (\"we fight terrorists and blow up drug factories\" [sic]) can exist without its own set of serious internal problems and existential, even moral dilemmas. The most prominent instance of this is the way in which the issue of double-agents simply working for the highest bidder (i.e. mercenaries being mercenaries) is dealt with in a much more serious and significant way than the first season. TSR singlehandedly makes MITHRIL into a well-rounded, believable organization, and not simply a bunch of people with high-tech equipment on a high-tech submarine--as was implied in the original series.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, The Second Raid is, not surprisingly, also a significant improvement over the first series. Kyoto Animation, now known almost exclusively for their \"moe\" shows, demonstrate their ability to make an action series which looks just as good, if not better, than most similar shows coming out today. The CGI is surprisingly well integrated, the character designs are still faithfully adapted from Gonzo's original, and the background designs are detailed and believable (the production staff did some lengthy on-site research of downtown Hong Kong). In fact, the sheer attention to detail in general is one of the things that makes this series truly stand out on the technical level. This includes all the little things which add to the overall sense of realism, particularly in the action scenes, such as a gun jamming, someone stumbling or tripping while running, desperately padding the ground behind them for an object to throw, or even something like tiny drops of bottled Scotch hitting the table during the pouring process. On a audio-related note, ADV's dub of this series is one of the best I have heard thus far, especially in regards to rendering important conversations and lines of dialogue in a strikingly dramatic, yet believable fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the examples are too numerous to list exhaustively, all of this hopefully can somewhat elucidate how well The Second Raid in essence works within the confines and limitations of the \"Full Metal Panic universe,\" while at the same time managing to fully flesh out many of the  interesting and underdeveloped potentialities of that universe. As a technical achievement, it is both more colorful as well as more violent, and as a writing achievement it is also much deeper and far more realistic. On the whole, this series manages to be highly engaging on both the intellectual and visceral levels, in a way that the first offering simply never fully realized. All these elements combined make Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid a personal number one favorite within the mecha-action genre. \\n\\n\r\nAside from a somewhat \"rushed\" finale, perhaps my only complaint about this series is its length: at a mere 13 episodes, and an intentionally \"open\" ending, it naturally leaves one wishing for more. However, keeping in mind that a series' length can be a curse as well as a blessing, perhaps the relatively short episode count is something to be desired if the tightly-written, plot-driven quality is sustained throughout. After all, keeping in mind that decent chunks of the first series were simply filler, perhaps a 24-episode reboot of this would not be preferable after all. \\n\\n\r\nI believe this sequel is aimed at adults, not teenagers, and will have less appeal to people are faint of heart or generally unwilling to ask any serious moral and/or existential questions. Therefore for those who perhaps were, or currently are dismayed by the initial series' somewhat mediocre and \"juvenile\" nature, I can firmly say that the existence of The Second Raid makes it all completely worth it. Basically, this is Full Metal Panic's The Dark Knight. Only better.\\n",

            "content": "People may look at this and think of it as a typical mecha anime but if you\u2019ve seen Full Metal Panic then you\u2019ll know that this franchise isn\u2019t loved only for its mechs.\r\nFull Metal Panic! The Second Raid is the true sequel to the fantastic Shounen, Romance, Comedy, Mecha anime; Full Metal Panic! It basically starts where the story left of with teenage mercenary Sousuke Sagara continuing to fulfill missions for Mithril (the military organization), whilst protecting the teenage girl Kaname Chidori who is being targeted by other organizations. However this time round TSR focuses on a more serious storyline, full of drama.\r\nThe series beginsliterally with a bang, as the Mithril team intervene with what seems to be a civil war. This first episode is basically just to reintroduce all the characters in one incredibly action-packed episode. This is then followed by a school episode, which is full of the usual hilarious comedy that this series is loved for. However after this small amount of light-hearted comedy the story becomes mostly serious, as it focuses more on the action and drama side of things, by introducing new enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is brought about by the exciting and nerve-whacking missions, which flow well from one another. There is a good sense, with the pacing of the action, in the series because it never rushes or drags things out like many anime tend to do. The drama on the other hand is what sets TSR apart from the previous ones as it really centres on the 2 main characters; Sousuke and Kaname and how the change in their situations affected them. With that fans get to see a different side to both of them, which is a good change however because of this the other characters (namely Tessa) are somewhat neglected.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking into the animation of TSR, the one thing that comes to mind is the guys who produced it, \u201cKyoto Animation\u201d. Having the series produced by KyoAni was the best move ever as we have consistent, crystal clear visuals, with completely fluid animation. The music is nothing particularly amazing but it definitely goes well with every situation; with nice pumping beats for the action and solemn tunes to go with the dismal mood in the drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall TSR on its own could easily take the title of Best Mecha anime ever, with so much going for it like: the animation, story, the lovable characters, excitement and its appeal. Yet the fact that it\u2019s only 13 episodes long leaves so much untold and begging for a sequel. Hopefully there will be a continuation to this amazing story but for now fans will need to be contented with what is available. ^_^",

            "content": "You know, honestly, I'm not sure why Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid (TSR for short) is not ranked with a higher score than it currently has.  This show surpasses every aspect of Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, which you should be watching first for the sake of chronological order.  Like any sequel in a series, people expect the next one to deliver more than the previous, and deliver TSR has.  Even though the prequel, Fumoffu, is a great comedy between the main characters, Sousuke and Kaname,TSR does not follow suit.  Instead, think of the first series, but much better overall.\\n\\n\r\n            First off, the story is great.  For a thirteen episode series, TSR packs a lot of plot into it.  The story is continuously interesting from the very first opening scene to the last ending scene.  Again, although TSR carries a lot of it's predecessors' traits into this series, it is quite apparent from the first couple of minutes into the show that this storyline is darker than what fans may be used to.  But, don't let this deter you because it sets a serious tone which attracts your attention throughout the entire thirteen episodes.  It's not like TSR doesn't have any comedy in it, it's just that they use it more sparingly than the previous two series.  All in all though, TSR storyline is a roller coaster of emotions, which will not disappoint anyone, as it is simply fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n            What can I say about the art?  It's very good.  Again, compared to the other two series, the animation in TSR is a huge step up.  The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, and the lighting effects used in this series are awesome.  The colors are sharp and crisp, and the animation is smooth beyond belief.  Just by watching even the smallest movement in the characters, you can see the effort that was put into TSR.  This over-the-top quality animation is very apparent during the mech battles, which look just fantastic.  There are only a couple of brief instances where the animation suffers a little, but it definitely does not take anything away from the series.\\n\\n\r\n            The music and sounds in TSR are also great.  The song artist from the first two series returns, and she does not disappoint with the opening and ending themes.  Like the other openings and endings in the Full Metal Panic! series, the songs fit the tone of TSR perfectly.  The background music is great as well, as it really sets the right atmosphere depicted by the story. As for the sound effects, they are as realistic as can be, and some of them were quite unique in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n            Ah yes, the characters.  I must say that I simply love watching the characters interact with each other in the Full Metal Panic! series.  From the minor characters to the major ones, TSR will not disappoint in this department.  I kid you not; the character development in TSR is truly outstanding.  Watching the relationship between Sousuke and Kaname in this series alone has personally made them my favorite anime couple.  I definitely thought it was the most attracting part about the show, as you can really feel what they are thinking and what they are going through.  This is why you need to see the other two series before this one.  Watching these characters grow and develop in TSR gives you a roller coaster ride of emotions, and it is just fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n            Well, finally, the enjoyment factor.  To sum it up in three words: I love it.  This is how an anime should be done in every aspect.  The episodes in TSR were consistently very good, and it basically improved on everything that made Full Metal Panic! good in the first place, and turned it into something outstanding.  By the way, I am not a critic who gives out an overall score of ten very easily.  In fact, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid and only one other anime have received an overall score of ten from me.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  Just give it a try for yourself.\\n\\n\r\n:-)",

            "content": "FMP! The Second Raid\r\nOk this is an improvement from the first season but still has the same problems that makes it not enjoyable, just like in the first one and that problem is Chidori and her constant unjustified violence and other considerable problems of interaction between Sousuke and Chidori.\r\nStory\r\nThe story starts two months after the first season with a somehow changed enviroment, like if Chidori was more violent and isn't aware of the hard work Sousuke is put on by Mithril but for some reason she is bitchy towards him for not being there for her (he should be sorry for saving people) and whenhe is close to her she starts with her unjustified violence and that happens even in serious scenes where ''comedy'' is not required and i even thought she improved because of one particular ep. and therefore starting to understand Sousuke but when she reappears after what was a mature story with Sousuke as the protagonist, she blew my enjoyment, that enjoyment that could gave the anime a higher score, that enjoymen that i was having with an improved story, i was thinking that the story was much better without Chidori and just focused on Sousuke and the Mecha drama, it was a much better setting, what was the best is that Sousuke was finally asking himself what was he doing with his life? is that what he wants to keep doing? does he want to keep following orders even if he by following them couldn't protect Chidori? and i knew the story was more mature in the manga because i was spoiled that scene of what he did with that Chinese woman, it only surprised me that it wasn't adapted like it was in the manga, the thing is that Chidori ruined the story with her uncalled violence, but the story is good even with all that mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation improved a lot, more smooth and much better in general, nothing to complain about it but yeah is very good considering it was from 2005.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nBetter music and it has the same VA but more concentrated to make a great job at doing the voices; The OP is kind of like in the first season skippable and the ED was odd, it has something that made me think it was sad for some reason, it's crazy considering the clip is Sousuke and Chidori walking but with a maybe normal ED song, i don't know just that in general it's very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nA more improved cast of good characters but is not enough to consider the characters the strong point of the anime because if it has a particular character improvement like Sousuke then we are presented with Chidori and her same attitude, for some reason they act different, what happened in the gap time of two months from first season and second raid because is not explained why Chidori has Alzheimer with Sousuke and what he does in his daily life and why Sousuke acts like a douche with Tessa and Tessa's character was another problem, she was one of the few that i liked in the first season and now she is like almost not there and why would Sousuke say she's important to him but he doesn't show it, it's a mess, i liked that Chidori was missing Sousuke and acting like him when he was not around in one particular ep. and i thought that she was finally going to understand him and his protective persona and at that point for some reason i didn't hated her but when she finally reunites with him like i pointed before she blew it with her stupidity again, i was trying to find the reason on why she used violence with him, i can't even... The Xia twins were interesting but it wasn't enough, i wanted more of them and it was obvious who their master was when that Gates guy mocked their master and of course Melissa and Kurz are the same.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nLike i stated the enjoyment is good and even more if people don't mind a character like Chidori, not her character as the whole problem but her attitude, i can't stand that kind of character with unjustified violence and not that i don't like Tsunderes because i do but that is one of those cases that are annoying and not enjoyable at all because that ''comedy'' is not comedy for me.",

            "content": "This is probably going to be difficult to review without giving too much away,  but I'll try to keep it simple.  I'm not too used to reviewing - so bare with me here! I'll start off by saying that I absolutely adored the first series of FMP! And, to be honest, was completely overjoyed when I found out that a second season was also being released.  However, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed by the length of FMP!TSR. At a mere 13 episodes, I didn't really think that it was long enough - compared to its predecessor at ajust right episode count of 24.  But this small problem didn't stop me from actually watching the series.  But despite it's length, it certainly contains enough action.  There's a lot more going on in this second series than the first - and they still managed to do it all in a small amount of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's favorite clueless Sargent is having problems in balancing his work with Mythril, as well as his 'public' life as a sort-of bodyguard for Kaname.  As a result of this conflict, Sousuke is having difficulty in trying to balance his life between the two, but mostly it causes problems for the Mythril side of operations.  This continues on during the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe love triangle that existed in the first series and transcended into the 'spin-off' series FMP!Fumoffu is even more apparent here.  Of course, there's also Tessa the ever present captain of the Tuatha de Danaan (or Toybox).  It's quite interesting to see how the relationship between these three characters continued to develop from the first season, through to fumoffu? and then to TSR.  I won't reveal too much though.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the character development in this series is very good.  Better than in some other anime's that I have seen in this particular genre.  The animation style continues it's high standard, and is definitely no exception in this season either.  And to put the cherry on the top Mikuni Shimokawa returns to perform both the opening and closing themes of the anime.  Could you ask for anything better?  If you're a fan of the anime - or even a fan of the novels that this series is based on, I would most definitely recommend it.  I'm just hoping now that they do a third season!  As I think that this season really left some openings for a third series.  But I'll let you make your own conclusions about that.",

            "content": "As Yahtzee Croshaw once said, \"A good sequel is one that uses the original as a jumping-off point for a brand new story, while a bad sequel simply wallows in the original like a hippo in a vat of liquidized children\". Seeing as how the original Full Metal Panic was fairly mediocre, with only a particularly impressive antagonist pulling it through its inconsistency, poor characterization and bad pacing, it would have been very regrettable if The Second Raid had simply taken the latter route and rehashed the first series in an inferior format. So what a shock we're in for, as Full Metal Panic: TSRis by far superior to its predecessor in almost every way.\\n\\n\r\nPart of what helps is Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu. One of the major problems the first series had was that it kept swinging between generic highschool comedy and military action, and made no real attempt to weave it together. Overall, it would have been better if they had been two shorter series as opposed to one 24-episode one. And that is exactly what they did here. Whilst Fumoffu went about doing the highschool comedy much better than the original did, TSR does the exact same thing for the military action. Whilst TSR does have some comedy here and there, this time around it feels necessary, and gets woven into the story, rather than being some pointless distraction from the plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the plot does take a handful of episodes to properly kick in, it follows as such: Mithril discovers that another organisation creating chaos has similar technology to their Lambda Driver, a one-of-a-kind device that only the protagonist has the ability to use... and doesn't seem to be able to anymore. Also, rogue members of the aforementioned organisation are starting chaos in the unstable Chinese government, for an unknown \"Sensei\" of theirs. All through this, Sosuke is being put through the serious strain of protecting the \"Whispered\" Kaname Chidori, whilst maintaining his highschool fa\u00e7ade, and undertaking his regular military missions.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this, our previously annoying, personality-devoid protagonist is put between a rock and a hard place, gets forced to genuinely come into his own as a character, and rebel... and this is where the series shines. Whilst in the first season, the characters were bland, annoying, and totally devoid of development, with Sosuke being the worst, here Sosuke manages to get some extremely impressive character development turning him from perhaps the worst to the best character over the course of only a few episodes. They also manage to replace antagonist Gauron with another fantastically psychotic antagonist, Gates. Whilst Gauron was more entertainingly evil, and outright disturbed, Gates' outright psychopathy is actually played more for laughs, e.g. having his crew kill off his attackers, and then suddenly remembering he needed to extract information from them first. They play his brand of hilarious gore so well that there's never a dull moment with him on screen. This is all somewhat underplayed by the fact that Gates isn't actually that important to the plot, though. Whilst an antagonistic force is clearly in effect, Gates never really seems to effect the plot as a character, as though his personality and plot significance are two separate beings entirely. In fact, if i'm not mistaken, I don't think Gates ever speaks to a single one of the protagonists once in the entire course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd whilst we're speaking of antagonists, Gauron's motivations are finally explained here. Whilst they made little sense in the first series, they finally have some light shed on them, although they are rumouredly more fleshed out in the manga. With this given, the only truly annoying character remaining is Kaname Chidori, who manages to fall easily into the \"helpless maiden\" archetype, going through every \"Dead Teenager\" horror movie clich\u00e9 in one particular episode.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, unlike the first series, this episode cuts in at only 13 episodes, being one of those series that really leaves you wanting more. In fact, it almost feels rushed, and in some ways feels like a clich\u00e9d attempt to pull things together. To its credit, though, it manages to tie up all but a few unimportant plot threads this time... and those look as though they'll be tied up in another series anyway. We can only hope, because with this and Fumoffu under FMP's belt, it's definitely worth watching the first series just to get to this.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Frankly, one of the best anime sequels, if not the best, that i've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 4/10\\n\r\nEnglish Dub: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "After finishing watching The Second Raid (TSR) around 20 minutes ago, I was left with a feeling of fulfillment anime rarely ever gives me these days. As an action series it's hard to fault: the action was enjoyable to watch, helped by the high production values, and it had a strong cast of characters that painted over the simplicity of the story. It did everything it needed to do right and ticked all of my boxes, meeting my overly critical standards.\r\nThis wasn't the case with the original FMP series, though. Back when I watched that I was left a bit underwhelmed by an experience I'dexpected to be a lot more enjoyable than it turned out to be. The constant switching between school comedy and anti-terrorism/mecha action let it down, interrupting the flow and making it difficult to get into the serious episodes. And, with the quality of the serious stories and comedy varying from decent to very good, the quality of the content wasn't enough save a series suffering from an identity crisis. I gave it 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first series, someone with a brain obviously decided it would be a better idea to separate the serious and comedy elements into two series, removing the problems caused by the conflicting genres. The comedy side of things got its very own series first in the way Fumoffu and, as you'd expect, lots of school insanity involving Sagara and Kaname followed. It worked out far better without any robot goings on getting in the way, helped by the comedy scenes being far more funny than most of those shown in the original series. I gave it 8/10, but I would've probably scored it higher if not for my sense of humour failure.\\n\\n\r\nTSR, which came out after Fumoffu, did the reverse and focused on the anti-terrorism side. I wasn't really sure what to expect after ending up disappointed with the more serious sections of the original series, not even the high ratings making me confident. I only got around to watching it after I saw and won an auction for the art box + entire series on eBay.co.uk, the motivation not having been there after finishing Fumoffu many months earlier. But, when I did finally get around to watching it, I found myself struggling to find faults, and even the faults I found were only relatively minor things, such as the use of abbreviations without any explanations being given.\\n\\n\r\nAs you'd expect with TSR being an action series, the story wasn't memorable. The threat of civil war appears, Mythril send out Arm Slaves to intervene, the threat of war is averted and the cycle starts anew. Mixed in is an organization called Amalgam that creates wars to test out weapons and profits from doing so. None of it is hard to understand or what I'd consider to be memorable.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what made TSR better than most other action series? The characters. Since most watchers would've viewed the previous FMP series before getting into this, most of the character introductions and basic development wasn't necessary, leaving more than enough time for the new characters to get introduced and allowing for the already established characters to get additional development. Talking of new additions, the new characters were pretty good, the insane new villain Gates and a pair of sexy Chinese twins being the best of the lot.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, The Sagara/Kaname relationship received the most time and, as a result, was the strongest non-action point of the series. I came to like/love/want to sex Kaname far more by the end, the determination and emotions shown by her raising my opinion of her even higher than it was prior to watching. Sagara, on the other hand, was more hit and miss: I hated him for a lengthy period of TSR for being a coward, but I did end up warming up to him towards the end; when the interaction between the two resumed. The one consistent thought that ran through my mind when watching Sagara was that without Kaname around him he's neither likable nor very interesting...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't help but rate TSR highly. It successfully pleased someone hard to please, meaning it's a show that I'm sure the majority of anime fans out there that haven't got around to watching it yet would love to bits. Looking for a short and high quality action/mecha series? If so, this is for you.",

            "content": "When Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu aired many fans questioned whether or not the then unknown animation studio Kyoto Animation (Kyoani) would be up to the task.  It was pretty obvious that they were and after establishing themselves with the otakun community with Air: TV it was clear they were a force to be reckoned with.  Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid (FMP: TSR) the direct sequel of Full Metal Panic! (FMP) would be their next project and in the end became a worthy sequel.  Perhaps FMP:TSR could even be considered to be superior to the first FMP.\r\nFMP: TSR story/structure can be easilydescribed by its opening and ending.  The opening, Minami Kaze is a song that features hardship yet remains optimistic for the future while, accompanying primarily military/mecha scenes.  Where as the ending, Mou Ichido Kimi ni Aitai is a somber piece about 2 lover separated and wish to meet again.  This song is accompanied with shots of an empty school and Sagara and Chidori walking together.  The opening is distinctly representative of the first half of FMP: TSR as there is quite a bit of fact paced action.  Easily some of the best &lsquo;light&rsquo; military action scenes I&rsquo;ve seen.  In addition, there is a bit of military drama but it never gets too heavy.  Mou Ichido Kimi ni Aitai, the ending song is best representative of the 2nd half.  FMP: TSR takes a more serious turn focusing on the character drama between Sagara and Chidori, in particular Sagara.  Both halves were very good in their right however, the transition between them could have been better.  The beginning was very story driven but suddenly ends up character driven.\\n\\n\r\nMany of my complaints for the first Full Metal Panic! still apply.  All of the villains are extremely flat, Gates isn&rsquo;t much more than a crazed lunatic and the Xia sisters are pretty boring albeit badass.  They did introduce another villain that should to prove interesting in the next Full Metal Panic&rsquo;s.  There are also a few plot holes/inconsistencies that can be annoying.  The use of comedy, one of FMP best parts felt a bit awkward the beginning of FMP: TSR.  In particular, the 2nd episode, it felt like they were forcing the comedy in-between story segments.  Thankfully, the balance was found later on in the series.         \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, once again similar to the first FMP, they are pretty interesting and fun to watch.  However, what really separates FMP: TSR and FMP! would be the more serious character drama in the 2nd half of the series.  This part was extremely well done and gives Sagara the much needed character depth and growth.   I&rsquo;ll stop now for fear of spoiling any more.  Let me just say that for the next FMP&rsquo;s  this is easily one of the biggest things I&rsquo;m looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe one part that FMP: TSR really improves upon would be the animation/art.  Action was extremely fluid and well choreographed.  They were among the best mecha action scenes I&rsquo;ve seen in any anime.  In addition, many of the actions scenes are extremely fun to watch, as it never got too gritty/realistic.  Art was equally good and consistant.  Overall, Kyoani truly deserve the reputation they have for high quality animation/art.  Music, was good, but nothing really note worthy.\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Panic: The Second Raid features an action packed beginning with bits of drama.  Actions scenes are among the best I&rsquo;ve seen and the art/animation is of the highest quality, as expected of Kyoani.  However, the 2nd half takes a more serious turn, focusing on character drama between Sagara and Chidori, in particular Sagara.  This darker more serious turn is was really separates itself from the first Full Metal Panic!  In addition, this gives Sagara the much needed character depth and growth.  The transition between the 2 halves could have been done better as it feels a bit too much of a jump between the story driven first half and the character driven second half.  Also, the villains were a bit flat, with the exception of one who should prove interesting in the upcoming Full Metal Panic&rsquo;s.  However, these complaints can&rsquo;t take away from the fact that Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid is an enjoyable watch featuring excellent actions scenes and character drama.  Now where&rsquo;s the sequel?",

            "content": "Sleek animation, adrenalin pumping action, and a great plot containing many twists and turns, I really should have enjoyed this more than I did. I lay the blame on one of my friends, who hyped it up way too much for me. I mean, there is no doubt that \"Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid\" is very good show, but it's no where near the best anime ever, or even one of the best, like my friend had claimed.\r\n\"The Second Raid\" is a generally good all-round anime that succeeds very well at what it tries to do, which is to be a kick ass actiondriven show. Nevertheless, it contains some flaws, and lacks that certain I-don't-know-what that distinguishes something that's one of the greats from something that's just another great anime. It's the kind of aura that makes you love it even when it's uber hyped. \"Berserk\" has it, even though incompleteness marred the series badly; \"Full Metal Alchemist\" has it enough to overcome my general hate for anime comedy. \"The Second Raid\" however, doesn't have \"it\".\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation, \"The Second Raid\" is almost impeccable. Wonderfully rich colours and clean artwork combines with the great CG makes this an absolute treat for the eyes. The only problem is, the characters look so great for the most part that Chidori's slightly exaggerated character design (inherited from the original series) that reflects her rather loud, brash personality seems out of place when everything else looks so perfect. This kind of thing is reflected in the content of the anime too. \"The Second Raid\" is mostly serious, and when it is serious, it is for the most part, really good. But occasionally they try to slip in some comedy, and it just doesn't work as it well as it does in previous series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is well executed, and contains enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, but there's nothing that extraordinary about it, nothing you've not seen a couple of times before from somewhere. I still remember the desert mission from the original series, but I barely remember anything from \"The Second Raid\". In addition, there still doesn't seem to be much information on certain enigmas such as the whispered etc that's left unexplained in the first season. Whether this is because Kyoto Animation didn't feel like wiping Gonzo's arse after them as they took over the franchise following season 1, or whether it's because the answers to those mysteries are still not revealed in the source material, I can only speculate.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, the characters makes and breaks this show. My friend especially like the way they developed Sousuke out of his box personality in \"The Second Raid\", and though it didn't quite have the same amount of affect on me, I can certainly see what he was getting at. Chidori also gets some nice development, as the extreme back-to-the-wall circumstances she faces in the series brings out a steely quality in her character. Thankfully, they are the central characters of the franchise, so the fact that they are good weighs heavily in the favour of this anime, which is just as well, because the side characters aren't all that.\\n\\n\r\nLike with the first season, I really feel the need to let off some steam with a \"Tessa rant\". \"Watch TSR, then you'll see why Tessa makes such a good captain,\" my friend told me, in response to when I said a character like Tessa being captain is absurd. It's true that during one incident in this particular series Tessa shows some backbone, but it's also true that previous to the incident she does something that makes her look like the lovesick little girl that she is. It also speaks volumes when her subordinate are all so surprised that she could show such backbone... such faith they place in their commanding officer :P It pretty much proves my point about her lack of presence. A certain conversation between Tessa and her superior indicated that her superior also habours doubts about her ability to be captain, but that she had insisted. So let me get this straight - her superior didn't think she was suitable, and yet he still let her be captain just cos that is what she wanted?? Are they suppose to be a military organisation or a nursery?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't forget the new fanservice characters. In addition to Tessa, they've now added a pair of Chinese twin sisters. In case being lesbians ain't servicing the fans enough, they've also thrown in some incest action for good measure. The fact that they were originally male in the source material speaks for itself, really. Then we have the villain. Clearly they're trying to make the most crazy villain ever here. Perhaps they succeeded, but for me they've gone a bit overboard with it. The effort of making him crazy purely for the sake of craziness just made him seem waaay too weird for my liking, not to mention annoying.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the previous series, \"The Second Raid\" features some nice jpop opening/ending themes and background music. Here's something interesting: I was listening to my iPod, and mistook the background music from \"Full Metal Panic\" for the epic sound track off \"Gundam Seed\". Not such a surprise once I found out that Sahashi Toshihiko is the composer behind both. Just listening to the sound track, it's hard to distinguish between the two anime, but while watching the anime, I found the music in \"Gundam Seed\" to be a lot more powerful and memorable. I guess it just goes to show that the music and the contents of the anime can be mutually influencing, and that \"Full Metal Panic\" just isn't as epic as \"Gundam Seed\". \\n\\n\r\nThe one major complaint I have with the otherwise great sound production is the wooden Chinese spoken in the anime (\"The Second Raid\" takes place in China). In fact, it seems like a general trend that foreign language spoken by natives in anime sounds flat. I'm guessing that one reason might be because it's not worth the effort looking for native speakers with voice acting credentials just for the purpose of voicing extras, and so they just end up pulling ordinary people off the streets to voice these roles... and surprise surprise they turn out not to be very good at it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil the last episode, I was prepared to rate this higher than the first season, as I was quite enthralled by the numerous turn of events, but the last episode is very weak. Sousuke's conversation with his mecha is just so... cheesey... there's just no other term for it, as much as I dislike using that word. That attempt at light humour totally falls flat on its face. I did rather like the ending involving Sousuke and Chidori, but I suspect what one guy said about their relationship most likely returning to their static state eventually to be true. After all, that is the main attraction of the whole franchise, and at the very least, it's something that \"Full Metal Panic\" does consistently well.",

            "content": "Picture the scene: A rainy night on top of a love hotel. A girl wearing nothing but a tattered dressing gown is down on her knees. She\u2019s been sexually assaulted and just had to watch someone be choked to death. Shivering with her arms wrapped around her, she casts her face towards the sky, tears and rain dripping down her face, and screams \u201cWHHHHYYYYYYYYY\u201d. Fade to black, roll end of episode credits.\r\nThis is a thing that happens in The Second Raid. I get that you wanted to get serious this season after Fumoffu, but there\u2019s serious and there\u2019s surgically removing all the fun from afranchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second Raid is a huge angst-fest, growing an emo-fringe down to its knees as characters throw aside their regular characterisation to shiver and moan and agonise over the pain of existence. Sagara, the once straight talking, straight shooting male lead, goes down the path of alcohol and hookers. He regards the death of his comrades with cold apathy. He starts following the cult of nihilism, asking what is the point in living on this gay earth anymore. I get that they\u2019re trying to communicate to us that he just really cares about Kaname and doesn\u2019t want to be apart from her, but there has to be a better way to demonstrate this that doesn\u2019t involve beating up repeatedly with the frying pan of angstyness. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s another way we can understand his pain without it being so tedious and irritating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe new villains in this arc, brought upon by this shift in tone, are equally terrible. The Chinese assassin twins are where most of the horribleness revolves around. They\u2019re the main recipients of the anime\u2019s new turn into the Violence and Tits arena, and it comes off as immature at best and exploitative and worst. Particularly when you consider there\u2019s tits everywhere while they too are contemplating the pain of their existence and them being raped by their new boss. The violence usually surrounds them too, with shots of things like spinal columns poking out the top of slit necks and things like that. It\u2019s not saying anything with the violence and sexuality either. With the tone of TSR, it comes off as trying to appear hardcore.\\n\\n\r\nThe leader of the military group in TSR deserves credit for making me appreciate the first season\u2019s Gauron a whole lot more. I\u2019d always thought Gauron was a bit crazy and psychotic and wondered why people kept funding him, but at least Gauron didn\u2019t randomly shoot dudes in the face who were on his team. At least Gauron was capable of holding a conversation enough for a deal to go through. You only realise Gauron\u2019s insanity when you get up close and look into his eyes when he makes a near suicidal decision, but up until then you can see why someone would follow his orders. His obsession with Sagara gave him some actual depth. The lunatic in TSR, on the other hand, is nothing more than a lunatic. What\u2019s most bizarre is the show seemed to be trying to play up his lunacy as comedy. His actions are so cartoony and exaggerated  it feels like he belongs in a totally different anime to the otherwise oppressive angst that the rest of the show has.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is also nonsensical. Sagara\u2019s story with Kaname is the main draw here, and that at least makes sense, if admittedly tonally off. The actual terrorism committed in this show is way stupider though. Asides from random nothings like \u201chey, lets introduce Tessa\u2019s brother like it\u2019s no big deal, and then do absolutely fuck all with him\u201d, the entire mission in the second half revolves around two depressed Chinese twins following the orders of a psychotic cripple as they escape from a lunatic scientist who rapes them when he\u2019s not shooting his subordinates in the face, all for the incredibly roundabout purpose of getting Sagara to walk into a single building. That\u2019s leaving aside the fact that somehow that guy managed to survive a self-destruct sequence inside his own robot with several tons of explosives right out in the middle of the ocean. I know he\u2019s supposed to give off this Terminator-vibe, but that\u2019s just silly. I\u2019m choosing to believe that he was just a figment of Sagara\u2019s depressed imagination. The plot arguably makes more sense that way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this more depressing (for me that is, because I\u2019m not sure the tone of TSR could get more depressed) is that there\u2019s clearly a better show here. Kyoto Animation\u2019s production quality and general shine is light-years ahead of anything Gonzo ever did, even accounting for the 3 years advances in animation technology KyoAni had. Shame that they put this talent into something so angsty and hardcore. This sounds especially weird coming from me, who could not give a rats ass about anything KyoAni make nowadays because of their devotion to the bible of cute, but badly made hardcore angst is just as tedious as shallow cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nThing is, there are two episodes in the middle of TSR that are amazing. It has a fantastic chase sequence through some town in Sicily where Kurz, Mao and Sagara try to escape the mafia in a crappy little car, which has that brilliant quality of any great chase sequence in that events keep spiralling up and become more dramatic as it goes on. Then that episode is followed by easily the best scene in the entire FMP canon: The haircut scene. Its remarkable in its low-key simplicity. Wonderfully directed, with pregnant pauses and great sound design and a closeness to it that captures fantastically how much Sagara and Kaname feel safe around each other, with so much being said with so little. Its perfection hurts, with makes it that much more disappointing when the rest of the show careers off into angst-town.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026now where\u2019s season 3 damnit.",

Story begins from three months after the original FMP.\r\nStory:\r\nStory was good and overall better balanced than in first series. Story was rather quick because of limidet episode quantity. I feel that story would have been maybe better if they had made few more episodes but it was good even now. This one had less humour and darker athmosphere than first one but I actually liked it. It felt somehow better and better fitted for this series.\r\nArt:\r\nThis in one thing that I loved the most in this series. Art and drawing arereally awesome. You wont notice bad detailed parts like in some marathon series (Naruto, Bleach etc.) Everything is really precisely done and the animation studio has really put effort to this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound and the sountrack was overall good. Nothing earthbreaking but they fitted well in the series and its athmosphere. Nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters were easely likable and overall there were something for everyone. Most of the characters were from the first series but some new ones made their first appereance. The new bad guy Gates was well done and very unique. Overall new characters fitted well in the story and I didn't hate anyone. It is good sign if you don't dislike any character. It means they are done well. This one had more character development too. Sousuke really stardet to think something other than military and I liked that change. It made him feel moore natural.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this series. It had good mix of action, drama and humour.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked this anime very much. everything was so well made that this sucked me truly with it. Only complain is the episode quantity. 13 is really small amount for anime. I highly recommend this anime even if you don't like mecha. \\n\\n",

I know that can be a factor of me just liking the look of new anime moor, but I think this still looks worse then some anime during that time or before it. but, the animation in the second season looks spectacular and still holds up to this day\r\nthe story is a lot better then the firs and it seems a lot less repetitive.I think the reason for this is because the characters deal with more internal conflicts now. The protagonist seems less of a blank slate in this season then he did in the last season. and i feel like some of the side characters are actually decent now. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is still the same as the first one i think\\n\\n\r\nthe characters are way better this season. the villain has a more bombastic personality and i like watching him, and the other new characters are good as well. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show and would recommend it. i myself am not much of a mech fan so if i can watch it then most people can to. its also a great introduction to mech series.",

            "content": "The Darkest FMP! Series To Date: \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is defiantly strong, it picks off well from where the first series left off, and has a good pacing speeding up/slowing down when necessary, There isn't a single filler episode in this series, and I felt that after every episode I watched that the plot or the characters had developed a little; which is obviously very positive. I won't talk too much about the story itself so not to ruin it for people who haven't seen it yet, but it is defiantly a good continuation of the first series\r\n9/10\r\nArt:\r\nFMP! has always had it's own distintive art style,the animation is certainly superb; the moment the intro sequence begins you know you are in for something special and the attention to detail really makes for a realistic setting, the fight scenes are especially good and the blood looks really realistic, the settings are much darker than the other two series and really adds to the overall tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNo anime series is complete without a good OST, and this series defiantly doesn't let up in this department. From fantastic opening and ending songs to fantastic mood music, the whole score sounds perfect and really seems to fit well with where it's put, whether it's low sounding beats for mysterious scenes or softer songs for more delacit moments, there's never a moment when the music seems irregular or out of place\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters have always been my favourite part of the FMP! series, but this series sees more development than the first two combined. Never have we seen Sousuke more emotional or Kaname more helpless, there were genuine moments when I was on the edge of my seat to see what happens next between them. Not only does there relationship develop, but also Sousuke as a character, he defiantly seems like he's grown up alittle by the end of the series and is ready to live life the way he wants to, which is a message that applies to us all.  Appearances from the ever perverted Kurtz and the strong willed Melissa just help add to the character side with Sousuke experiencing different emotions around the both of them. The new villians introduced were excellent and worked on so many levels, there more violent nature really made the series alot darker than I imaged it would be, and really had character that made them stand out as memorable villians.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Well that's a combination of everything above really, the fact I was a big fan before this series just meant that I was hyped as hell waiting and then watching this series, and seeing some more development between the characters I love really made it a worthwhile watch, but to fully enjoy it you defiantly have to atleast seen the first series (the second series, being a spin off, is briefly referred to in scenes but not in relevence to the plot). \\n\\n\r\nI'm a harsh critic so I very rarely hand out 10s, but this series really ticked all the boxes it had to and defiantly exceeded all expectations, I'd reccomend watching this if you watched and enjoyed the first two series, be warned this one is more violent and does contain a few bloody scenes.",

            "content": "Fans of the original Full Metal Panic will find more of exactly what they loved about the first season with Full Metal Panic the 2nd Raid.  The show really doesn\u2019t deviate from what made the first season a success, and even manages to build onto that a bit.\r\nStory:  I won\u2019t go into the specifics of the story, but the second season seems to focus less on the dangers to Chidori and instead focuses more on Sousuke\u2019s life as a soldier as well as some new enemies he will have to face.  As with the first series, I\u2019ve always thought that FMP isweaker when it tries to focus on the mecha and military aspect of the show.  I think the heart of the show is the comedy that usually goes with the pairing of Sousuke and Chidori, and since this season seems to be more focused on the military aspect, I think it loses something for that.  On the flip side, there is a lot of growth for the characters in this season, particularly Sousuke who you really wind up liking more by end of the season.  The enemies in this particular season are hit or miss, as I enjoyed the twin sisters as villains, but found myself utterly annoyed with the crazy bastard they\u2019ve setup as the main villain.  Despite the fact that I think the show once again strays from its real heart and lacks a truly enjoyable antagonist, it\u2019s still a great season overall and one that fans of the series will love none the less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  I\u2019ve already talked a bit about Chidori and Sousuke.  Chidori doesn\u2019t seem to grow as much in this season as does Sousuke, although she faces some challenges and she has some of the best moments in the entire show.  This season is really about Sousuke, his growth as a person beyond his military career and his feelings towards Chidori.  I think the best scene in the entire season is the haircut scene, which ironically other people have chided for being too slow.  That scene really shows the growth of their relationship and again, these two and their relationship is the real core of this show, so the better that is, the better the show is overall.  The side characters pretty much all take a back seat in this season though, as almost none of the classmates are even seen, and even Mao and Kurz have very minor roles, but largely that\u2019s due to the shortened season I believe.  \\n\\n\r\nPresentation:  Overall, there isn\u2019t anything to really complain about when it comes to the visuals and audio of FMP.  The animation is solid and the music is all around pretty good.  The only downside is that nothing really stands out in either area.  The people are all rather bland in terms of anime characters, and the robots are easily among the blandest mecha I\u2019ve ever seen period.  It makes sense within the confines of the show that you\u2019d want them to be realistic looking, but they don\u2019t need to be downright boring looking.  In the end, the presentation isn\u2019t anything to detract from the show, it just doesn\u2019t add anything great to it either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  This is where FMP really shines and picks up most of its score with me.  Despite the fact that I still think the show waddles in the middle of doing anything in particular exceptionally, it still manages to be really enjoyable.  The fight scenes are fun, if not spectacular and the comedy portions are still hysterical.  Despite not finding anything in particular to really draw me into FMP, I still found myself loving this season.  I think the reason that everyone loves this show is that it has some distinct charm, and that goes a long way.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, FMP: 2nd Raid is another good season to a good show.  I can\u2019t classify it as great, as I think that there are shows out there that handle each of its respective parts better.  But as a blending of high school comedy and mecha action shows, it works incredibly well.  And it\u2019s just a charming show that you always find yourself loving.  Fans of FMP won\u2019t need to be told to watch this season, so for everyone else, I can only say that if you give it a shot, this will probably win you over.",

            "content": "It was three years ago (on my 17th birthday) that I sat down and watched the first series of Full Metal Panic! Heck I enjoyed it, I thought it was clever, funny, suspenseful and terribly entertaining. However when it came to the end I was happy to move on with my life expecting it to be over (I'm used to one series anime). I really regret waiting those three years to watch the second raid. \r\nThe storyline (in which it really is essential that you have watched the first series) relies less on the meccha action side and really focusses on character development. Souske finallystarts showing emotions and that is the part that had me wishing that every episode was that little bit longer. One of the main plot points revolves around Souske being forbidden to contact Kaname in any way shape or form and these episodes were really fascinating. Seeing Kaname suffer through abandonment made you feel something for the both of them and that's what makes a moving piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nMy one and only dissapointment was that they introduced some new and really interesting characters (Gates, Xia Yu Lan, Xia Yu Fan and Leonard Testarossa especially) that I really wish had some more screen time. Although the series was more dramatic because of the 13 episode run which meant it could really focus on the main plot it also means we get less time understanding these new characters. Maybe a few more couldn't hurt?\\n\\n\r\nThe Full Metal Panic series, be it the first run, Fumoffu or The Second Raid has a little bit of everything in for everyone no matter what their tastes are. I only hope they continue to make a fourth series because they know how to hit every mark right.",

            "content": "And the panic keeps going, it seems. I was not too fond of the first series, nor the Fumoffu comedy, but this actually was quite ok. I really wanted to like the earlier FMP stuff, and at last something cood came up.\r\nAnimation\t\r\nFlawless as usual from this title. It's basically the same as in the earlier incarnations, but with better animated fighting scenes and a little bit more gore. Character design and backgrounds are as great as always. Top notch!\r\nSound\t\r\nThe FMP titles have always had nice intro/outro songs, and this is no exception, although I must say it is worse than 1nd season and Fumoffu. Stillnice music.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a bit irritated over Chidori's constant screaming, but overall the voice acting feels genuine. Not that I speak japanese, so I wouldn't know. The feeling is good, though.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nThe story focuses almost entirely on Sosuke this time, which means lots of mecha action and less of the school life. I guess we all got enough of that in Fumoffu. Still, I think the big potential FMP has, is the tension between Sosuke and Chidori and much of that risked getting lost in the Second Raid. It turned out ok, since  much of the story is about his confusion having to choose between duty and the lass.\\n\\n\r\nThe more combat-oriented story is quite good, with some cool intrigues and a couple of twists. A couple of things felt wierd, and really twisted to get the story going. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a more than decent story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nSosuke is finally starting to feel like at least part human, rather than a war droid. His increasing affection towards Chidori is confusing him, making him queston his role. Interesting.\\n\\n\r\nChidori is as stubborn and loud as ever, but as we have seem before, she actually likes Sosuke. Sometimes this shines through, and these times she is really cute. She doesn't add much to the story herself, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains are cool, I didn't get what that blonde boy was all about (I suppose he'll come back in a later FMP), but the twin girls and the crazy boss were great in their own ways. The crazy guy was actually one of the best villains I have ever seen in an anime, almost as good as Papacha from \"Photon\".\\n\\n\r\nSosuke's comrades-in-arms are... well, they are also great. Teresa gets a little more screen time, which is nice. I like her, she is such a paradox.\\n\\n\r\nValue\t\\n\r\nI probably won't watch this again in a long time, but it made me feel like watching the 1st season again just to check out some background fluff. It probably will make me disappointed again, just as it did the first time. Doesn't change the fact that I actually liked this anime, though.",

            "content": "This third season of Full Metal Panic \"The Second Raid\" is probably my favorite of the three. It's definitely the most competently made: It has fantastic action sequences, an interesting plot and features much better pacing, animation and characterizations! The military stuff in this one is actually pretty damn good and\ufeff it's balanced much better with the\ufeff show's campier side which is hilarious as ever!\r\nOn the dramatic side of things: Sousuke and Kaname's relationship is pushed to its limits when they're unwillingly split up! In one heartbreaking scene Kaname calls out for Sousuke's help, but for the first time in the series - Sousuke isnot there for her. It gets very tense and you really feel for both of them during their lonesome struggles! They're obviously deeply in love but neither is willing to admit it to one another, which is of course one of the reason why we love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite scene of the whole season is where Kaname cuts Sousuke's hair. It's perfectly written, perfectly acted (at least in the English dub) and perfectly directed. I've never been into shipping much, but Kaname and Sousuke are hands down my favorite anime couple of all time so this scene was very sweet and satisfying! For all the REAL shippers out there - This is probably the closest thing we'll get to a sex-scene with these two! \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the season you're left wanting more and saddened that Kyoto Animation cant figure out how to continue the anime... I award \"The Second Raid\" a glowing 9/10 - It's an excellent (if slightly unforfilling) end to one of the best and funniest anime series ever conceived! \\n\\n\r\nNOW BRING ON SEASON 4 ALREADY!",

However i am still amazed of how good its story is, and even through i am one of does guys who DO NOT LIKE MECHA ANIME I STILL LOVE THIS SHOW.\r\nOne of the reason for my love of the Full Metal Panic Franchies, can be that its one of the few anime`sout there, with a very strong female lead, even compared to today. I can`t think of a show with a female lead, as unique as Kaname Chidori from this show. On the other site we have Tessa, Sosukes captain, that have to take extreamly hard desition, and put her own situation aside, to support our main characters, even though it is emotional hard for her. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is alot more action packed than season 1, and it tells a far better story, and expants the universe just like a good sequel should do. At the same times it keeps its humor high, while still stepping into some emotional territory and it is doing it got damn good. I would say that my enjoyment of this was outstanding, compared to the first season, and one of the reason may be that it was some good and packed 13 episodes i was provided with.\\n\\n\r\nI am in such love with the Characters that i have to give it 10/10, i don`t know if its nostalgia that let me think so high of this serie, but it just hits me like a wrecking ball.",

            "content": "\"Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid\" (TSR) is a wast improvement to it\u00b4s prequel \"Full Metal Panic!\" (FMP). It\u00b4s not often the sequel surpasses the prequel, but in this case it really does - in every category. I did enjoy the first part, but it contained many things that could been done better (better pacing, better character interactions, better music and so on). So what made \"TSR\" so much better in my eyes? I will get down to that now. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is picking up two months after the events \"FMP\", so you have to watch the first part to understand what\u00b4s happening. InTSR we get more of the things that was so good in \"FMP\". It contains more action (mostly really nice mecha fights), connected to Mithrils missions. And in TSR you can start to see a red thread in this missions. Something is starting be clear - it\u00b4s not just random events but a enemy group (Amalgam) is actually behind most of the situations that Mithril has to take care of. Amalgams objectives also starts to come into the light, which makes the whole story much more compelling to me (love evil arch enemies with more objectives then just being evil). The story also takes a bit more serious tone (don\u00b4t worry, its still a lot of comedy involved), which suites the situations more and made me feel more for the characters. The interaction between many characters was also much better, which deepened the bond between them more (HUGE plus). It made me feel a whole a lot more for them in this 13 episodes then all the other 26. The pacing was much more even (not 2-3 intense ones and 4-5 slow ones), the flow between more action toned episodes and story filling toned episodes felt much more balanced. The only thing I\u00b4m missing is more info about the \"whispered\". It\u00b4s a build up for a continuation, but so far a new season hasn\u00b4t been announced. But it\u00b4s much more source material, so I guess I have to dig in to the manga now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nFor a 2005 production the art and animation is great! It also a significant improvement to the prequel. The colors, motions, light setting and so on looks really good. The backgrounds and the details of them are amazing - really liked that they have put so much time and money in them. The mechas never seems out of place, which they sometimes can do in other anime. The characters look the same but have got an upgrade in quality and coloring. Overall very much to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThank god that they did something drastic about the soundtrack! The soundtrack to FMP sounded much like something to a 90\u00b4s action cartoon (hated it). But  the soundtrack to TSR are much more pleasing and suiting to the feeling of the anime - MEGA plus. OP and ED was also really good. A more up beat OP and a more slow and emotional ED. For VA (I watched the dubbed), I think most of them did a good job of catching the core of the character and how they expresses them self.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nFor starters I can say I like most of the cast. They have a broad variety of personalities and backgrounds. Most characters don\u00b4t feel shallow or boring. They all have personal traits and way of acting. Most of their emotions and expression of them is relatable and logical. The interaction between the characters also gained a new level, both in comical situations and more serious ones. That made the whole experiences of TSR that much more greater for me. The main characters had a lot more development in this season, compared to the first. We are also introduced to new characters, both allies and enemies. The most entertaining of them for me was the psycho villain dude and the psycho (incestious?) twin sisters. They shore made their impact on the story. We are also introduced to a new major player form the Amalgam organization, who has close connection with one in the top of Mithril. He really peaked my interest.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked a lot is that we get to know more about Sousukes past, which highly explains way he is like and acts like he does. He also developed much during TSR. He goes from being the stiff and non questioning soldier, to being more human that can feel and express emotions. He also starts to think about how he want to live his life, and starts to become aware of his feelings for Kaname. Kaname is still her old loud and violent self, but is tested raver hard when she is left alone and have to fend for her self. But that makes her grow and become even stronger - the girl is a survivor for shore. She also starts to realize her feeling for Sousuke but don\u00b4t really have the guts to tell him how she feels. And my girl Major Melissa Mao. Always a pleasure to see her do her thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed myself watching TSR! I watched in two days, that\u00b4s saying something. I had high hopes for it after reading some very positive reviews on it, and I wasn\u00b4t the least disappointed - I agree to the letter. I was intrigued, excited and almost couldn\u00b4t wait to click forth next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nBAAM! Now we talking. Now I\u00b4m totally on the \"Full metal panic!\" hype train. A good balanced pace and mix of action, drama and comedy made this ride awesome for me. Add to that the show got a bit of more serious tone, which I think it\u00b4s suited for and we got some good character development. If you are into mechas with a loads of comedy and drama with some hints of romance - well this is the shit for you.",

The Second Raid's plot isn't as much structured into arcs this season as it's more telling one cohesive story in the span of 13 episodes, this undoubtedly GREATLY reduces the \"school antics\" this season and more or less focus on plot at hand,it's new villains and FINALLY what LA was wanting from the first season to improve on which is our main duo of Chidori and Sousuke gets their development arcs this season in FULL FORCE and done brilliantly might LA add. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the new villains for starters, we have Gates voiced by John Swasey and Mouchuu Ootsuka along with Yu Lan Xia voiced by Kira Vincent Davis and Miyuki Sawashiro and Yu Fan Xia voiced by Emi Shinohara and Christine Auten and while Gates is probably the most unstable nihilistic villain in this roster of villains, he has VERY similar to traits to Gauron from the first season just jack his nihilism and add a quirky psychotically unstable personality and we have...a BETTER GAURON, so yes LA kinda liked Gates better than Gauron, BUT the Xia sisters were sympathetic villains to say the least even if they were ruthless assassins with ulterior motives using Gates as a results along with their mysterious \"Sensei\" giving them orders as well as Gates. There is one other villain but considering the loose plot points with him, LA thinks we'll be seeing him in another season. ALL in all the villains departments IS dealt with better in this season even if they aren't entirely fleshed out like Gauron but still LA liked the new roster of villains Sousuke and Chidori faces this season.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto our main duo and by all means, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid utterly gave what LA wanted the first season to flesh out and that's Sousuke and Chidori. Though Sousuke got the bulk of the development this season, Chidori obviously played a role as well. See the first season didn't exactly give us much about Sousuke's situation with both handling his job in Mithril as well as his \"normal life with Chidori\" and this season fully give us the levity of him struggling to handle both and done effectively enough that he's much more than a lapdog to the military and fleshed out his personality as a result. Chidori on the other hand had backstory and lore of the Full Metal Panic world through her being a Whispered and helped Sousuke with his Lambda Driver from the first season, this season Chidori was more of an emotional crutch to Sousuke AND better yet, showing herself that she can kick ass outside of Sousuke and goes into Sousuke's world by her own will for Sousuke this season and even faced her own villains outside of Sousuke's, essentially this development to both Sousuke and Chidori not only gave off a much stronger romantic vibes that were vaguely there in the first season but also fleshed out both characters both in personality and having a stake in the plot something that was really lacking in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid hardly has any bearing towards school life (but more or less Sousuke's contemplation of it instead), this season really cranked up the seriousness of this season and no not in an edgy way, like shit really went down this season, from revelations of plans dating back to the first season, civil wars and brutal kills and deaths shown in gory fashion, sure the first season had this too but considering the animation it's warranted that along with the levity of the situation Sousuke and Chidori goes through as well as the new villains also warrants this.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the major focus being put on the the main duo of Sousuke and Chidori, it means the supporting characters become just that and that includes Tessa in this case and sure because she didn't get much screentime this season, Tessa was and is LA's favourite character in the franchise. Nonetheless in terms of minor characters, new and old get their screentime be it helping out Sousuke or Chidori (though the school side of things are VERY isolated considering the fact) or are obstacles in the way if they are villainous side characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of animation well we have a change in studios, from Studio DEEN to Kyoto Ani and it SHOWS, from crisper character designs, decently good background work and again the crazy and bombastic yet ruthless battles with the AS and CQC this season goes through. If anything Kyoto Ani just trimmed the edges of Studio DEEN's work and gave it a more polished and crisper look to it is what LA is saying, nonetheless expected from the Kyoto Ani and from one of their earliest works no less.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you didn't notice but LA noted BOTH the Japanese and English voice actors in this season and yes LA looked at both versions (just switched from Japanese to English halfway through) and the English dub by ADV Studios well the dub is SEAMLESS to say the least. Seriously this dub gets most of the inflictions of the characters right down to a T, from Luci Christian as Chidori (but she was less abrasive than Satsuki Yukino oddly enough that made her a bit more tolerable in this dub) to Chris Patton as Sousuke and Hilary Haag was quite honestly a perfect cast as Tessa. LA was SURPRISED that John Swasey was voicing Gates as LA remembers him as Death in Soul Eater, LA will praise the ADR Director Don Rush with how great the dub is because of this. Ok nonetheless this dub by ADV was amazing and seamless and LA quite recommends watching the dub (only if you don't like Chidori in Japanese which LA was impartial about). As for the Japanese well it's expected from the original cast with Houchuu Ootsuka hamming it up with Miyuki Sawashiro and Emi Shinohara as the villains. Yes LA had a problem with Satsuki Yukino as Chidori mainly her violent tsundere tendencies and much prefer Luci Christian's Chidori but still Satsuki was great as Chidori considering she's the base template for the original Chidori and finally Tomokazu Seki was good as Sousuke with his limited turned \"given more range\" that Sousuke goes through.\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Panic! The Second Raid was undoubtedly a massive improvement to the first season in not only quality but quantity considering it told it's story in half the amount of episodes as the first season (though you can say it's semantics in this case), improving on it's characters (mainly it's main duo), more likable villains though this was LA's bias in liking the new villains compared to Gauron, Kyoto Ani's touch in animation giving the animation a more polished look and though this season sucks up any \"school life\", it sacrificed that element for not only \"seriousness in the plot\" but a more focused yet brutal season as a result with a small detriment of giving this season little time to breathe but it was a compromise that turned out for the better in LA's eyes.\\n\\n\r\nFull Metal Panic! The Second Raid is by far LA's favorite season of FMP! no doubt about it and no it's not because Kyoto Ani is helming the project, it improved massively outside of it's animation among other things, but LA will see if Fumoffu! can beat out Second Raid or not in due time...",

            "content": "Before you read this review, I should put some disclaimers.  First of all, this is going to be an analysis of both seasons of Full Metal Panic.  Fumoffu will not be discussed because it's just a comedy based spinoff, and I want to talk primarily about the characters and themes.  Second, there will be MAJOR spoilers.  And third, I will talk very briefly at the end about the new season that recently started airing.  Also, the rating that I gave it, 9/10, isn't just for this season, but it's for the series overall.  With all that being said, let'sget to it!  \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite anime of all time.  I first watched it last year, and I was blown away.  It was one of the many anime that was on my infinitely long plan to watch list, and I\u2019m glad that I finally got to it.  On the surface, it\u2019s nothing special, just an action, romance, drama, comedy anime, with an idiot main character, and a Tsundere love interest, that\u2019s based on a light novel.  That in and of itself is incredibly common, except this one has mechs in it.  But no, this is the real deal.  Back in the day Full Metal Panic was pretty popular in the online anime community, but in recent years the hype seems to have subsided, probably because it\u2019s been thirteen years with no season 3.  However, Season 3 is currently airing, and I am stoked.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been this damn excited for a newly airing anime before even starting it, as sad as that sounds.  I absolutely love the characters in this show.  All of the central characters start out pretty simple, but are expanded upon in interesting and sometimes even unique ways as the story progresses.  Kaname Chidori is the Tsundere that I previously mentioned.   She fits all of the standard tropes.  She\u2019s hot headed and loud-mouthed, she gets angry really easily, but she can be kind to people, such as with her close friends, and she slowly begins to warm up towards Sosuke over the course of the series.  However, there\u2019s a few things that sets her apart.  First, she isn\u2019t nearly as obnoxious as your typical Tsundere.  \\n\\n\r\nThink of her as kind of similar to Rin Tohsaka from the Fate franchise, only a tiny bit more extreme.  The second thing that sets her apart is that she actually gets character development.  I don\u2019t think development is always necessary for every character, but for characters like this then it definitely is.  She doesn\u2019t change completely by the end, but it\u2019s enough to make her bearable.  And the third reason she\u2019s a good character is because she\u2019s one of the necessary components for Sosuke\u2019s character arc, which I\u2019ll talk about later.  She\u2019s actually my second favorite female character in the series, which I was completely stunned by.  Her entire existence embodies being free spirited and self reliant, not wanting anyone or anything, weather a person regardless of rank and status or fate itself, to choose her path in life, which is a sentiment that I can really respect.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, my FAVORITE female character in the series would be Teletha Testarossa, the clumsy teenage Captain and creator of the Tuatha De Danaan.  A child prodigy, she is Sosuke Sagara\u2019s direct superior, and even has romantic feelings for him, which she\u2019s always kept inside as to not distract him from his duties.  As explained before, I love Teletha.  I love her general personality, which can go from being a professional leader which she\u2019s on board her submarine, to a kind, gentle, and even humorous teenage girl when she\u2019s on vacation, sometimes changing from one to the other at the drop of a hat.  I also think she has the most tragic background of any of the main cast.  \\n\\n\r\nNot only has she had to keep her feelings for Sosuke hidden due to their professional responsibilities, but she ends up getting heartbroken during the second season, which granted any of us could have seen coming, and the end of season 2 hints that her elder brother might be part of the enemy forces.  Teletha is interesting because she has a prodigal level of intellect and leadership abilities, but is still a child at heart, as seen in Season 2 when she and Sosuke have a heated confrontation and she breaks down in front of him.  However, her mathematical and scientific powers are still dwarfed by her elder brother\u2019s, which gives her a sense of inferiority.  Sosuke Sagara is the main character.  He was a soldier raised from a young age to serve, and has never known life outside of Mthril, the branch of the Japanese military that he\u2019s from.  \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, he knows nothing abut life outside of the military.  This was never an issue before because he\u2019s never had to interact with anyone outside of the military.  However, at the start of the series he\u2019s assigned to protect Kaname Chidori, a girl who is secretly one of the Whispered.  The Whispered are people who are subconsciously capable of creating Black Technology, devices that are far more advanced than those of the present time.  They also have subconscious knowledge that nobody else does, and because of that the organization Amalgam wants to capture them.  Due to this mission, he has to find a way to blend in to society perfectly, and, well, yeah, it\u2019s a work in progress.  And by that I mean he never does.  \\n\\n\r\nAt first this is where a lot of the comedy comes from, but later on that ends up segueing into his character arc.  Not an arc in terms of him learning how to act more like a normal person, because like I said, that never really occurs, but a coming of age story.  While it does progress in the first two seasons, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely done, because my thought is that he\u2019ll eventually be given the decision to either remain with Mithril or live a normal life.  This is going to be a lengthy discussion because while I loved this arc I did have some issues with it.  What makes Sosuke interesting is the fact that he\u2019s a child soldier who has to learn how civilians live, and what makes him complex is not only how different he acts on the battlefield compared to in normal society, but also the fact that because he\u2019s so unfamiliar with normal society, he has no intention of ever quitting the military and being a soldier until the day he dies.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is where my complaints comes in.  And it has to do with both Kaname and Melissa Mao, a fellow soldier and good friend of Sosuke.  In most scenes Mao provides a lot of comedy relief, but there\u2019s one scene when Mao bitches him out for the dumbest reason ever, which I can only chalk up to the fact that he\u2019s following orders.  You see, at a certain point in the Second Raid, it really seemed like many of them, (the biggest one was Mao, but Kaname was also a culprit in this), were trying to get Sosuke to disobey orders and follow his own path.  However, my issue with this is that, he\u2019s a soldier, and soldiers have it drilled into their heads that you never disobey orders, for any reason, you obey without question.  This occurs when Sosuke\u2019s superiors tell him to go on another mission, which forces him to abandon Kaname.  \\n\\n\r\nI understand what Mao is getting at, don\u2019t get me wrong, but what is he supposed to do, just tell his superiors no, I\u2019m not going to obey orders?  I don\u2019t get that at all.  It\u2019s easier for me to defend Kaname in this regard because not only is she not a soldier, but as I explained earlier she\u2019s extremely free spirited and is all about choosing her own destiny.  But Mao is also a soldier, she should know the consequences for insubordination.  Not to mention, this is the only life he\u2019s ever known, since he\u2019s been fighting, presumably, since he was eight years old.  It only gets more confusing at the end, because he was almost severely punished for finally disobeying orders and deserting his mission, but then wasn\u2019t because of some speech he gave, which also didn\u2019t make much sense.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, that\u2019s what you would expect, but again, Mao pushed him into this, she was very clearly telling him to disobey orders.  It\u2019s actually really funny, both him and Mao were in a vehicle together, he was driving, he was distracted by the fact that Kaname was unprotected, Mao berated him of course, and then, just as she told him to leave, not really as an order but more of a suggestion, he does, without question.  I dunno if I\u2019m the only one having these problems, but this really irked me.  And here\u2019s another complaint of mine.  Why in the hell are his superiors sending him on missions anyways!?  I just spent a few minutes complaining about Mao, but they\u2019re just as bad.  They know he\u2019s already on a mission, and they know how CRUCIAL this mission is, so why don\u2019t they just leave him on this mission.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd I\u2019m including Teletha int that as well.  As much as I love her character, she\u2019s also his superior.  In fact, she\u2019s his highest superior, so she should have a say as to what mission he is or isn\u2019t sent on.  The only reason I can think of is that she\u2019s in love with Sosuke to, so maybe constantly sending him away on missions is a way for her to selfishly keep him away from Kaname, but I think that\u2019s a long shot. Even though she did break down in front of Sosuke towards the end of the Second Raid, confessing to him, I still don\u2019t think that she would go that low, especially since she knows that keeping Sosuke away from Kaname only raises the chances that Kaname could be abducted by Amalgam.  I\u2019ve voiced these complaints to people before, and the only thing they were sort of able to come up with is that both Mao and Kaname, in their own ways, wanted Sosuke to grow up and mature, but that doesn\u2019t make much sense to me.  \\n\\n\r\nHow could you say he\u2019s not mature, when, as a soldier, he\u2019s most concerned with doing his job and following orders, sounds pretty mature to me.  I should also mention that this whole confusion in Sosuke\u2019s mind between his missions and Kaname herself started because he\u2019s obviously falling in love with her.  It\u2019s pretty ironic that if he was never sent on this mission, all of these issues would have never even existed.  That\u2019s not really a complaint though, just an observation.  I also want to mention a more minor complaint, and that\u2019s the high school scenes.  It should be no secret that many people are burnt out on high school anime these days, and so am I.  While I love almost every other part of the show, and some of the highschool scenes I could tolerate due to the comedy, other ones I\u2019ve found myself just skipping by because they\u2019re boring.  \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the CGI with the mechs wasn\u2019t the greatest, but bad CGI is common in anime, and I have seen far worse, it certainly didn\u2019t ever take me out of the experience, so it\u2019s more of a nitpick than anything else.  Despite all of those gripes, I still love the series though.  The main draw, at least for me, isn\u2019t the story, but the characters, there intrigues, their personalities, and there relationships with one another.  Oh, also the fight scenes.  This series had some of the most enjoyable mecha fights that I\u2019ve ever seen, which is a plus.  So, how\u2019s season 3 holding up so far  Well, pretty good, actually.  At the time of this writing season 3 only has 4 episodes out, and, well, it\u2019s just as good as the first two seasons.  All of the recurring characters are just as I remember them, and the best part is that it literally picks up immediately where it left off.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the opening scene of season 3, Teletha is praying on her parent\u2019s grave, and her brother arrives, who was first revealed at the end of season 2.  it just feels good to be back into the swing of things again.  And provided that this season doesn\u2019t finish off the story from the light novels, which I don\u2019t think it will because it\u2019s only going to be 12 episodes, I really hope another season comes before 13 more years passes.  Granted, I didn\u2019t have to wait as long as most people because I didn\u2019t view the series for the first time until just last year--and honestly, if it wasn\u2019t for season 3 being announced, there\u2019s a possibility that I still wouldn\u2019t have watched it--but still, that was way too long of a wait.  Also, I think I should mention that my favorite scene in probably the entire series so far is in episode 3 of Season 3, when Sosuke and Kaname have an emotional discussion with each other.",

            "content": "TSR is a wonderful action adventure that anyone (who can tolerate a bit of mech) will love. Despite being a sequel series, I believe that the execution was done in a manner that far surpasses the original. You can't help but enjoy it.\r\nThe story returns as Sosuke continues to struggle utilizing the full potential of the Arbalest while encountering new, dangerous foes.\r\nAnimation:\r\nKyoto animation delivers again. Crisp lines, eye catching color, and attention to detail create an absolutely stunning piece of work (minus the Mechs, which still look ugly).\r\nSound:\r\nOverall, I'd say the sound was better than the original but not as good as Fumoffu. The OPis quite good and serves as a refresher to the series. The voice acting is the same as the original and Fumoffu, overall a great job by Sosuke and Chidori.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe plot is very action oriented so prepare to see quite a few battles between the mechs. There are also many twists in the story which leaves the watcher constantly intrigued. Many of these twists deal with Sosuke's relationship with Chidori and how he pilots the Arbalest.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains here are all very skilled which heightens the tension during every battle. Combined with the fact that Sosuke can't fully use the lambda driver partially due to his disliking of the AS and you get a really intense show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts dark, and this only becomes stronger as the rising action builds endlessly towards a definite climax. This is resolved in a very satisfying fassion and sets the state for the forever-not-coming FMP TTR (The Third Raid?).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSosuke is completely torn apart in this series. He seems to fall deeper and deeper into despair as he can't properly utilize the Arbalest nor is he able to protect Chidori. You go through a roller coaster as his character changes from just a loyal servant of Mithril to an actual human being with innate desires. Chidori is more of a side character in this than the first series since it really focues on Sosuke but nonetheless makes critical appearances.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains in this also make this show really interesting. On one side, you have a psychotic terrorist Gates and on the other side you have two deadly, suggestively erotic, sisters. The characters in this series were absolutely great and complements the story nicely.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nFor thirteen episodes, you get one huge action and drama packed series. Definitely re-watchable and just hoping that they will eventually launch a sequel.",

            "content": "Wow. Huge improvement. This season is the DC cardioversion that the series needed.\r\nStory: This starts right after the events of season 1. A lot of the questions I had at the end of S1 were answered early in S2. For example, it bothered the hell out of me in S1 when Sagara would just stand there with his thumb up his ass while his teammates got slaughtered. Why on earth would he not start out using the one weapon that could counter Gauron? They explain that issue right off the bat in a way eerily reminiscent of an erectile dysfunction allegory. We also learn aboutMITHRIL\u2019s structure, organization, weaknesses etc., all of which were completely glossed over in the first season. Basically everything that happens in S2 off of school grounds gets an IQ boost.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, like a young female lawyer who had to strip to pay for law school, this anime tries its best to distance itself from a shameful past. The goofy commando in high school premise is present but no longer the main focus of the anime. All the gratuitous absurdity and wasted high school filler that polluted S1 is kept in check as the series tries to tell a darker, leaner and more serious narrative. \\n\r\nAction: This series definitely beefed up the action component. The fight scenes were slicker and the battlefields more complex. I was actually really impressed by the improvement. The enemies were smarter and deadlier. I liked Gauron in S1 but let\u2019s face it, he was basically the only one who gave MITHRIL a challenge. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It went up 2 notches. It\u2019s actually really good\u2026borderline gorgeous at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I learned what a gun barrel grating against teeth sounded like. The songs were nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: If you offer a starving man a Subway foot long he\u2019ll swear that mediocre sandwich is the best food in the world. In my case, I\u2019m still trying to decide if I\u2019m being objective in my praise or if the 24 subpar episodes of season one left me so starved for content that I\u2019m being overly generous here. I felt like most of the characters developed a 3rd dimension and became infinitely more likeable. \\n\\n\r\nSagara: As a character he definitely grew. Season 1 set the bar pretty low, going from robot to robot who can enjoy 30 minutes of fishing. That\u2019s about as platonic as it gets when hanging out with a girl. Anyway, some (but not all) of the obvious issues that S1 neglected to address are addressed in this season which is nice to see. As I said before, the action scenes are jazzed up this time around so as the lead action hero he\u2019s bound to shine more.  \\n\\n\r\nChidori: She started out with the standard issue tsundere mix of coldness and vulnerability. And while clich\u00e9, that character archetype lent itself to some form of depth and complexity. I\u2019m happy to say that she\u2019s improved even more and graduated from cookie-cutter bitchy tsundere to someone competent and interesting. I found her scenes to be some of the most suspenseful.\\n\\n\r\nTessa: She becomes more likeable although she still cries like a baby. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Am I nut hugging S2 a little bit? Yes. I certainly feel vindicated after trudging through all of S1. However, I think this season stands on its own merits and creates conflicts and characters interesting enough to compel some people to jump to the manga to finish the story. From what I gathered, the anime story is part of the FMP \u201cSigma\u201d manga series (there are like 5+ manga adaptations floating around).\\n\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: WTF. The violence went up bigtime. I was really surprised by some of the brutality.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: There was actually sexual tension and chemistry between the characters this time. I guess whoever castrated Sagara way back when must have missed one\u2026\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: if you thought S1 was missing a pair of nude lesbian sisters then you\u2019ll be relieved to know that S2 corrected that problem. If you were thankful that S1 didn\u2019t show a balding psycho pleasuring himself to kitten videos theeeen you might not like S2. And you think I\u2019m joking\u2026\\n",

            "content": "So I have put off watching this season for probably several years now because I heard that there was a cliffhanger at the end and because it ended several years ago there were basically no chance that there was going to be a forth season. Anyway, 2017 rolls around and a new season is announced. So now I have watched the second raid and I really enjoyed it for the exact reasons I enjoyed the first season. So if you enjoyed the first season I think you will enjoy this one. \r\nBut the real reason I am writing this review is to inform everyone discouragedlike me from watching this season like me that there isn't really a cliffhanger, they just leave the main story unfinished and some lose ends. \\n\\n\r\nHope this is helpful.",

            "content": "As a quick recap, Studio Gonzo did Season 1 and then dropped Full Metal Panic. For the record, Studio Gonzo makes questionable anime with sub-par animation for the most part. Full Metal Panic The Second Raid (FMP TSR) was then picked up by the amazing Kyoto Animation (FMP Fumoffu). Kyoto decided to go with director Yasuhiro Takemoto whom previously that year work on the show Air. It is important to note that at this time, Kyoto Animation was still in the process of establishing themselves as a studio, so it was important to get FMP The Second Raid right.\r\nThis series is set two months afterthe first series. It is still focused on our two main characters. Sonusuke Sagara is still the ultra-serious military soldier with zero common sense and given the task to protect Kaname Chidori, the hyper quick emotional cute school girl with special psy-powers of some kind called being \u201cwhispered.\u201d The military organization that Sagara works for is Mithril and for this series, the focus is about a secret organization that has obtained a technology to counter Mithril\u2019s mech-cloaking system.\\n\\n\r\nTSR is a fun take on the mecha genre as a whole adding loads of comedy to create a fun and serious show simultaneously. This time around, Kyoto went with adding a bit more fan service to go along with it. Compared to the \u201cok\u201d go around Studio Gonzo had with the first series, the comedy and action elements never seemed to completely mesh from mech battles to the high school comedy. In the case of how Kyoto handles everything is done supremely well. The action is top notch even though it is very much the same: go on mission, complete mission, next objective.\\n\\n\r\nIt is how Kyoto went with adding more serious elements where TSR shines. The comedy is still slap stick fun, but when serious romance and creating moments for the main characters to start grasping conflicting emotions, the audience also becomes emotionally involved with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the bad. The amount of plot holes is insurmountable and this creates a huge issue with how the show ends. This is a season of 13 episodes. It ends completely rushed. For a single season this would have been fine, but the series does not continue after this aka read the manga. This is a real shame since TSR was so fun, and not a way to complete FMP. Without another season, the ending is nothing other than unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not something that can be watched as a stand-alone show. Knowing the characters and watching the first FMP is important. Any fan of the mech genre and comedy would love FMP TSR, and want to experience so much more\u2026 time to get the manga.",

            "content": "story- in a sense it's the opposite of Fomoffu. while fomoffu is more focused on the school comedy side; second raid is more focused on the action, mech, and drama side. the story for this season is that a certain organization is arming militants with highg grade weapons as well causing trouble on their own. at the same time Sagara sosuke has been ordered to stop protecting Chidori and return back to service, as a new observer named WRAITH will now be watching over her.\r\nThe show can be cut into two parts of before he is to resign as Chidori's bodyguard, and after. the firsthalf is similar to the first season of FMP with keeping it's school comedy (too a lesser degree),  and the action parts that have gotten more screen time. it mostly focuses on how sagara is juggling his military life and his civilian life  as he can't be there for her all the time. not to mention the fact the an organization with high grade mechs is causing trouble. there is big problem in the show about location consistency  as people are able to appear and disappear from locations at the drop of a hat making many things to convenient in terms of story. \\n\r\nthe second half of the show is after Sagara resigned as Chidori's bodyguard. along with this the angst  and drama of the show shot up to the Nth level. with Sagara having to deal with the fact of leaving Chidori, and Chidori being with out Sagara. Sagara also feels lost on what to do if it comes to following orders, or being with Chidori. by the end of the story the person pulling the stings is found with a plan that is very unlikely to be possible but still happens anyway. Sagara lamba drives his way through his enemies in a spectacular manner, and things go back to the way they used to. \\n\r\nthe show did improve in many aspects than its predecessor. it had a much better atmosphere, it was more sharper and better with its shifts in tone, and surprisingly more violent which is good for what it's going for. however the contrivances still remain the same as many things feel so forced for the sake of things to happen, and for the most impossible of things to happen so perfectly.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\ncharacters- the main characters are still the same as always but do develop a little through the story. from Sagara going from some one uncertain of what to do with himself to at the end be able to be confident of what he wants to do. for Chidori....i don't really know honestly. several notable characters introduced are wraith a person who we are first hearing of but has always been there since season 1. a person who calls Sagara a hypocrite for not doing his job well, but when he now doing it alone is easily caught. the antagonists of the season aren't really that much as we go from bland to annoying and emotionless which although unpleasant is still an improvement even though not a good one.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nAnimation there is still those damn CGI helicopers and sub. other than that it was still well polished and done, the action and death looked cool. the character still looked nice and so on as before\\n\r\n7/10 \\n\r\nsound- decent as previous season but not much else\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nenjoyment- it was pretty ok; had it's problems but the action was good enough\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\noverall- it's story and character are fairly average . the animation still looks nice and the sound is decent\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nthe entire series as a whole is pretty mediocre. having a not so impressive start only for another studio to improve on it. now the series i believe is being handed to another studio and the series can change for better or for worse.\ufeff",

            "content": "Note: For this review, I decided to do something special: The entire commentary on the show is opinionated Episode by Episode(to help you relive the series and hopefully relate to this review better), be sure to tell me if you liked that. Also of course, this means its full of spoilers. It might be difficult to recall some references and moments in the episodes so maybe it's best to read each set of commentary as you go through the episodes yourself(assuming, you're willing to watch it). If you haven't seen the entire series you should just read my overall opinion(at the bottom). I will stilltry my best to make it a good review for anyone and everyone! \\n\\n\r\nEpisode One: What I way to return. The Very first episode has just as much or more action as it's predecessor. I love how they didn't try to hard to pull you back into the swing of things like other anime Spinoffs/OVAs, and yet they still managed to stick to their roots. Honestly this one seems to have gotten rid of a lot of the flaws too... damn near perfect so far. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode Two: Best stuff from FMP I've yet to see - Overwhelmingly entertaining, I wouldn't have been able to dislike no matter how hard I tried. Just amazing really. Hilariousness is definitely back in business and the new Villain guy... Awesome. I have unexceptionably high expectations for the rest of this show now! Even though it was obviously gonna happen sooner or later I'm glad to see Chidori and Sousuke are at it again. Also, this was by far the hottest episode from FMP so far.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Three: Spider-Man! - Why doesn't Sousuke man up and ask Captain Tessa on a date already? even a square like him should be able to tell that's what she wants. Already starting the missions again Sousuke? Come on... I want more school shenanigans to happen first. I can't wait to watch Fumoffu? because honestly these interrupting missions are becoming a huge annoyance to me. But I am glad to see the series is staying rounded. So far so good. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode Four: Things are getting a deeply weird, previously this anime has been fairly realistic(besides the robots and technology). Now with those sister-things and the sicko villain guy it's kinda creepy. I don't mind new elements being added--just please don't let it take over the show....I love it the way it is. Still enjoying it pretty good though.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Five: Not a dull scene to be found! I'm really growing fond of this writer. FINALLY we're going to see what Sousuke thinks about what's going on, seriously....took long enough eh? I love episodes where you're satisfied and also you're left having no idea what the one will be about, FMP does this often... and always does it right!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Six: Told ya he was spontaneous! Sousuke is such a wonderful person deep down. Anyways... to be honest I'm not exactly bananas over what's going on... they finally start really getting somewhere and now it's over?? NO! This better work out or Imma be pissed. Even though this show is still delivering greatness, are they really going to end the greatest part of the anime? I doubt it but... I'm worked up about it. Regarding every thing else in this episode, wasn't that good....too much politics and too much emotion is pouring out of Tessa--it's not much fun watching her act like a bab why do they keep doing it?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Seven: Ah, um... I don't know what to say. I need more to know how I feel... Sousuke you bastard. One of the most sad shows ever, I guess you don't know a good thing til its gone. Poor Chidori.... No matter how good a bodyguard, that scumbag Wraith isn't going to make her feel good though! I'm sorry for making this emotional but what else could I possibly say about this episode?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode Eight: No Chidori whatsoever, unforgivable! So, they have a new captain ... that's great and all but what about Chidori!? Give us a cliffhanger leave us hanging even in the continue, weird. It's clear Sousuke is now inspired to reach new heights in power, the only thing that is worth looking forward to right now. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode Nine: I take it back, I forgive FMP... and what a return. Chidori is truly one awesome psycho hottie lol (: even with all that deep voice & trash talk that guy who was watching her still got demolished!! I like this new guy(Tessa's brother)... finally someone comes onto the Blue-Hair Goddess properly. Pretty intense action too. I'm offically hooked again. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 10: I love Sousuke. There he goes again... \\n\r\nKind of a typical episode but its clearly made to lead up to a great ending so I'm still excited. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 11: What're you doing Sousuke!? Just because you're too scared to try with the real Chidori your gonna let yourself get AIDs from this lookalike floosy? That was close... maybe now he'll go to chidor--what the hell is he picking up..? NO FORGET THAT GO TO CHIDORI. I'm getting frustrated. The last few episodes have just been dragged out worthlessness leading up to no event. What the hell. At least I'm almost done with this series. Then again, maybe that means I'm about to get an awesome ending.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12: Whoa... Surprises and action, nice. There's still so much to be sorted out and a show like this has to go out with a bang, right...? How is all of this going to fit into one final episode. Well I'm about to find out. I look forward to writing about it honestly. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13: I figured maybe Chidori would step in this episode and Sousuke would save the day but wow... that was beautiful. I'm sorry for being so simple about it but I don't know how else to describe it. Chidori admits she wanted to jump into his arms as she was beating him up and motivating him at the same time. The battle is definitely epic, although it hardly made sense it still was awesome just because it was. Sousuke grows a personality somewhat and tells Tessa how he really feels. Sousuke returns to school, things are back to normal and then she starts crying--What stopped him from holding her? It becomes clear now that they both absolutely LOVE each other, teen love is weird but it possesses just as much beauty as any love and Full Metal Panic did it better than anything I've ever seen.  Back on the train again... what stopped her from telling him what she wanted to say? It'd be nice to know what she was going to say but honestly; it doesn't really matter. All that matters is that They're back Together, for some reason this only becomes clear as it happens. Solid ending. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Amazing start, amazing finish. Am I really clever enough to make this anime sound as good as it is? I really don't think so. Throughout the episodes there is many little moments to take note on but, the real highlights of this show are so clear I don't need to mention them all I have to say about them are: Wonderful. \\n\r\n- This anime does have several problems but they easily get overshadowed by the time you finish the series. This is review though so here are the downsides: Useless episodes, there is at least three to five of them and they seriously offer nothing--some of them happen while important events are going on... Somehow they get ignored and the whole show ends up being about how someone is feeling or something... Some of these episodes are the most entertaining but still, it just doesn't feel right. Another problem is that this is supposed to be a new season with a new name right? well then why the hell is EVERYTHING exactly the same??? They even brought Gauron back(although it was kind of expected). I'm glad things weren't a awkward transition but come on... give us something. No matter how good your story is you should never be afraid to try and improve it. Lastly, Just t the plain simple fact that it's over... the ending leaves us with so much hope for Sousuke and Chidori... but what's the point if it over? A great anime still overall, so great that I can't help but want more. \\n\\n\r\n- Please be honest in telling if this was helpful or not.\\n\r\n-- Thanks!\\n",

Since there are a few seasons the characters go quite into depth. ( make sure to watch the first season this is the second ) \r\nThe secondseason doesnt really relate to the first season.

After watching this anime however you cannot simply walk away without a word.\r\nI mean how on Earth it is possible that such a amazing piece didnt receive any continuations of the story. \r\nFull Metal Panic first sezon was great really unique, but then Second raid is improving upon it twofolds. It is amazing in story art and characters. You can see how much efforty was put into it and it ends in a way that begs for continuation, with second raid only prepering the stage for future content.\r\nThere are lots of series  spread thin in action,without any substancial story, with plot going on in circles, yet they span for several seasons. And when there is finally some increadible series packed with action, with great evolving story it gets cut short in place where evrything begun to really shine.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be one of the worst diapointments for me in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSure we can still hope someone will sometime pick up on this old series but it wont be the same it could have been. \\n\r\nStill Full Metal Panic remains an unforgetable experinence. With Second Raid beeing an example how should sequels be made.",

            "content": "We're back with Sousuke, Kaname, and Tessa. This time with a lot more action and much better pacing. Let's jump into it.\r\nCharacters\r\nThis series, Sousuke is noticeably more fleshed out. He's still his serious self, but we notice a little more development. He's often torn between when his orders contradict his feelings, a theme continued from the beginning of the original series (which I thought was the strongest). \r\nKaname is slightly more fleshed out as well. There's a nice episode where she's shown to be quite resourceful in the face of danger. Other than those few scenes, though, there isn't much. \r\nTessa's character is still great.She too must balance her feelings and her duty. It shows and foils well with Sousuke's conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of the other characters get much development. When a certain character from last season reappears, his motivations are still an enigma to me. \\n\\n\r\nOther supporting characters are more cliches than actual people. Belfangan is just the hard but fair, leader. Melissa is still the gunslinger girl. Kalinin gets like two lines. The villian is a crazy guy, etc. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is much better paced this time, at the cost of less humorous episodes. I don't mind the lack of humor since there's a whole other season of them lying over there ^. And they're not bad. \\n\\n\r\nAs for this story-- we get a crazy baddie working for some weapon development, evil corporation. Sound familiar? Honestly, it's the same old thing done over again with better pacing and character development.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the series never explains why Sousuke is at points so godly and at points a wimp. There's this whole, season long conflict where Sousuke is having trouble using his mecha, but then it all wraps up for no (real) reason at the end of the series. It still doesn't make any sense-- which hurts the show terribly. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe art/sound are good. There's actually some very nice lighting throughout the series. The voice acting is also noticeably better. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThe series still feels distilled, lacking. But this one is well paced and flows well, so you'll still want to come  back for more. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

I would suggest this anime to anyone who has a bit of free time and enjoys a good laugh. The plot of the series is severely lacking though. It introduces Kaname Chidori as being one of the \"whispered\" but after that it doesn't go into much depth about this being, which I thought could have played a bigger role in the series. But nonetheless the anime was still great. The characterdevelopment was amazing, and if you've watched all 3 seasons then I'm sure you would agree. The art work for the 3rd season was a definite improvement from the first two, which I thought was a major plus! I very much enjoyed watching this anime, and I wish for a 4th season, but I know that is not going to happen.",

            "content": "As an anime fan, if there's something that makes me really happy, its when the second season of a certain series fixes/upgrades on what the first season did and makes it much more enjoyable to watch. The first season of Full Metal Panic! (will be known as FMP! for now on) suffered from boring fillers and whether it wanted to be a Slice of Life High School Comedy or a Military Action Mecha. \r\nThere were easy resolutions to these problems. First, the fillers consisted of mainly the comedic portion of FMP!, so instead of creating a full-on Fumoffu?-esque episode, why not just include the comedywhile the main action is going on? Second, FMP! really shined as a Military Action Mecha more than the SoL HS Comedy, so keeping it centered on that would be great.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, the boys over at Kyoto Animation took over Gonzo's work and created the brilliant sequel of FMP!, known as The Second Raid.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are still the same from last time. We have our war freak Sousuke Sagara and the woman he is assigned to protect, Kaname Chidori. Don't worry, the loveable supporting characters are also still there, but don't play as big of a part. Its a damn shame too, because there were some pretty cool supporting characters that didn't really get the love they deserved, like Leonard and the Xia sisters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is kind of like the original FMP!'s in a way. You would have Sousuke living the school life that he was assigned to and some form of mission would come up that he would have to attend to. It does work out in the end because, like the original, all the missions in TSR have to do with one large issue in their way, which is Amalgam, another independent organization like Mithril. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue with the story is that you aren't given a large background of Amalgam. Its like KyotoAni just wanted us to know that Amalgam is Mithril's biggest problem at the moment since they have technology that is equal, or even superior, to Mithril's. The rest of the story plays out well, but it would've been nice to at least hear more of how Amalgam got together. It shouldn't have been difficult because Gonzo told the story of Gauron and what he meant to Sousuke and why he was a threat to Mithril in less than 13 episodes, which is the length of TSR. Shit, they even showed Gauron at work a couple times and didn't even put in a lot of screen time for that stuff either.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the story does end up being very well done, taking the amazing Action Mecha elements from the original series and making that the main premise of TSR, along with adding some superb dramatic scenes to increase the level of quality. The new antagonists are also very nice to see and I would say are much more of a threat than Gauron was, but I wouldn't say that there were as cool as him.\\n\\n\r\nKyotoAni also improved the animations from the original series. In the first FMP!, it seemed that Gonzo was too scared of showing off really gruesome moments. I'm guessing KyotoAni noticed that and made the actions scenes even better, showing things like throats getting slit and just letting TSR become more of a bloodbath in general, something that I also thought was missing in the original.\\n\\n\r\nI was never too much of a fan of the first season and Fumoffu?'s OP and ED. TSR has a very nice OP that I didn't end up skipping, until I got near the end of the series. The ED is average though, nothing really amazing. If you watched the original/Fumoffu? dubbed or subbed, then the same voice actors/seiyuus are here. I felt like the dub took a step forward from the original series, so props to the English voice actors for stepping it up.\\n\\n\r\nTSR was just an enjoyment overall to watch. There really wasn't one moment that I could say I was bored of a certain scene. Overall, Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid really improves over the first series a bunch. Its shorter than the first, but does a great job of telling the story in just a mere 13 episodes. The only things stopping TSR from being perfect is the uninformed background history of Amalgam and the lack of progression in the supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the original and you're wondering whether or not to start this or Fumoffu?, I would suggest watching this one first, but you can't really go wrong with either one in the end.",

            "content": "The first season was the intro, the second the development season, and this one, The Second Raid, is where serious seriousness goes down. Full Metal Panic up to this point has consisted of Sasuke and his mostly manageable life amidst being a mech piloting soldier and high school cover up, but thanks to greater international conflicts and the return of the main villain along with some new ones, stuff seems to spiral out of control gradually throughout the show. The plot is mostly serious and the high school fluff from Fomofufu and the first season and virtually nonexistent, but the action is epic and extremelytense, and this season moves along at a pretty good pace. The animation has stayed the same, it's nothing flashy or experimental, it does the job. The characters from the other seasons haven't changed a ton, so this season also solidifies the consistency of the plot and characters wonderfully. I don't really have a lot of complaints with this final season other than the ending doesn't seem to wrap up or shed any final light on Kaname and Sasuke's relationship, even though it hints at the fact that it's going to during the final episodes. So overall the ending of Full Metal Panic is really great and I had little problem with it. Great show with fantastic consistent continuity. The only thing that's bad about that, the show doesn't really get out of its comfort zone very much.",

It's simply the most beautiful work from FMP.\r\nI was told by many people that TSR (The second raid) was very serious. And I kinda took it to heart. I thought it'd be like warring and warring with 0 humour. But that's just exaggerated.\r\nTSR has the best graphics (beautiful graphics). It's a must try for anyone I rkn. \r\nStory-wise, it's like a continuation of FMP. I'd recommend watching FMP first, because it IS the original and there's always this thing about originals that you have to watch it beforeyou watch a sequel. Usually the first work is the best but not for FMP (in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nAgain, it's by Kyoto Animation (Fumoffu too) and I think after watching a few Kyoto Animation products, you'd find a similarity in style. Colourful settings, beautifully rendered. The character design looks slightly different from FMP, not as pointy. The op-ed and music were really catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the good thing about TSR is that it's short and sweet. Redundant side-stories (that are bad) and miscellaneous episodes were not added in. The focus in TSR is a lot more on the character development than any other thing. A bit emotional at times but the screenplays were creative. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it only lacks that little bit of magic (I can't particularly explain it), otherwise it would've probably ended up in my top 10.",

            "content": "If in Fumoffu there was no real plot, this time the story of Full Metal really continues. And as much as hilarious and light the storyline in Fumoffu or even in season one were, the drama in this sequel is heavier than ever. There are even some profanities, a healthy dose of nudity, and some gore scenes. However, even if this time it is a lot more serious and mature, it is not overly done. It is tasteful and every element is well-balanced. The excitement is tripled as more revelations about the plot is starting to unfold.\r\nOf course, for a new season there are fewnew characters. Some are just twisted and some are definitely mysterious. This time, the villains are nastier, more powerful, more skilled and a whole lot more twisted. As the protagonists are force to separate, there are some huge character developments for them in this sequel. You\u2019ll see them like you\u2019ve never seen them before. Sousuke, in this season has lots of first times. It is first time ever that we see Sousuke loses his cool when his feelings and decisions become so messed up when he is force to leave Chidori. We see him at his lowest time and it feels very surreal to see him make so many mistakes during a mission and that\u2019s all because of a GIRL. Never in his life that he encounters such feelings and he doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Also, we see him get mad about his orders something that we never see from him or even think that he would do as he is such an \u201call missions\u201d man. And most importantly, first time in his life that he would make a decision for himself and not because of some orders. Chidori, learns to do things on her own and protect herself after being left alone and knows no one to rely on. She realizes how safely she feels when Sousuke was around and by her side. Anyways, the incident makes them realize some important feelings and realization about themselves. It also makes them a lot closer. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation improves a lot since the previous seasons. It might not be that huge but the difference from the first two seasons is still very visible. The fight scenes are intense and exciting even more.\\n\\n\r\nThis is absolutely one of the very few series that I really want to see and continue to follow in anime form so bad. It is one of the very rare times that you feel so frustrated that you won\u2019t be able to see it in anime form already and you have to follow it in the original form. As much as I love the original, I am definitely a very visual person so I genuinely want it so bad to see in anime adaptation. Hopefully in the coming years! \\n",
