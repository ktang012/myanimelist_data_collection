            "content": "My first review or this site, and here on I plan to write reviews mostly to series that I feel are being unjustifiably bashed in previous reviews by other members.\r\nMnemosyne has been noticeably losing viewers as the numerous fanservice dedicated scenes become more evident, but since fanservice has become a staple in recent anime mostly due to commercial reasons, it is pointless to dislike a series based heavily on the amount and harshness of those.\r\nOne of the strongest points of the series is the interesting portrayal of immortal beings and the evolution of society and technology throughout the multiple decade time-skips between each episode, theaging of mortal characters and their long but passing relationship with the main characters. Compared to most other anime that do have long-living characters in their host, Mnemosyne presents a much more realistic and accurate view on the aspect, arguably comparable to that of the western classical RPG Vampire: The Masquerade.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists, while not presenting many, if any, noticeable original characteristics not seen in other works, manage to stay mysterious to the end, with very little of their motives, personalities and goals being apparent to the viewer, as well as their natures and origins, resulting in interesting but often small revelations occurring in every episode, successfully enticing the mind of the public.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists, as immortals, largely resist changes in personality and habits, and, as previously mentioned, maintain interesting relationships with the supporting cast, aware that those are fragile just as the lives of innumerous beings they have watched fade away throughout the ages, but also not treating them as disposable or of low value. Both are shown as having a substantial amount of knowledge, and as preserving the memories of those who were important to them. The main character's fighting ability is not as great as one would expect, but is overally consistent, without noticeable bursts of martial geniousness or inexplicable failures on sure-win situations.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mnemosyne can be viewed as a like-it-or-hate-it series, as it's merits are notable, it also requires a lot from the viewer to be appreciated, specially on the western side of the globe, due to it's heavy graphics and plot. It might also become a vanguard work, opening more space for future similar anime to bloom.",

            "content": "Okay, this is my first anime review, bear with it.\r\nMnemosyne is a truly orginal anime. I have never seen anything like it ever before. Each episode takes place in a different time frame and jumps decades at a time from episode to episode. What's more, the surrounding environment changes along with it. Technology developes, buildings that were once prominent become dilapidated and destroyed and charaters age.\r\nThe story seems to be complicated at first, but once it ends, the whole picture seems to fall into focus. The story surrounds a woman named Rin Asogi who runs a consulting agency with her friend Mimi and pet dogGenta. The thing is, they are both immortal from a plant called Yggdrasil which releases spores that if entered into a woman, makes them immortal and they can live for practically forever. But if it enters a male, they become angels and can only live for a short amount of time. When both are near each other, the female is sexually attracted to the angel and asks of him to &quot;devour&quot; her. \\n\\n\r\nEventually, Rin meets Kouki Maeno in the first episode and throughout the series, the Maeno family becomes the key element in the story along with a demigod Eipos who is adiment on eating Rin's timespore.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is fantastic, although the memory flashbacks kind of make it hard to see and understand what is going on. But that is the point of it all, since memories can become fuzzy and hard to remember.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great since you can hear every action shot, explosion and gut-wrenching scene quite clearly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, they are well diverse and well thought out and have a different spin on personality as well as leaving some family resemblance when it comes to the Maeno family.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Although some spots become difficult to understand when you start each episode. But overall, it was very good to watch and I highly recommend it for those of you who enjoy something aside from mainstream anime and don't mind nudity, action, explosions, etc. \\n\\n\r\nMnemosyne is one of a kind.",

            "content": "First, let me get the obvious out of the way: the first two words I heard about this series were \"torture porn\" and it's not far from the truth. I do think there's more to the show than that, it tries to have an engaging plot beyond pure smut and the concept is actually a decent one that somewhat justifies the show's perverse tendencies. Setting aside any moral issues I might have with it, for the purposes of this review it's no different than any other kind of fanservice, especially since it's sort of justified by the show's mythos. That said, if frequent nudity, eroticmoaning and women being torn asunder in various and sundry ways is a deal-breaker for you, there's no need to read this review any further because Rin: Daughter of Mnemosyne has quite a lot of that going on. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals behind Mnemosyne are hit and miss. On one hand, the backgrounds are nice and detailed and the animation is pretty solid and consistent, but on the other the use of lighting varies wildly in quality and the character designs are a bit generic, sometimes even dipping into ugly. When it's too dark, scenes that should be gripping just come out drab, and when it's too bright they end up looking gaudy. The show occasionally strikes the right balance, but the lack of consistency can be distracting, and the choreography behind the fights are pretty lackluster to boot. It's not completely incompetent, there are some good moments, but most of the show's important action scenes tend to fall flat. Maybe I'm being too harsh, it's perfectly watchable and never looks bad, it just could've used more panache. At the very least, it has a few decent camera angles mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it'd be more compelling with better music, but it was not meant to be. Half the time the music doesn't really support the series, it just feels like it was slapped on at the end with barely any thought given. It's a perfectly good soundtrack that could have matched the tone the series was going for in theory, but there was clearly very little effort put into its integration, so the strained music direction is a real shame. Combined with the poorly executed visuals, it makes all the difference between these scenes being edge-of-your-seat thrilling and just \"stuff that happens\". I will say that the opening and ending are both hilariously bad Engrish songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both languages is fine, perfectly serviceable all-around, but neither really tries to go beyond the call of duty. The exception to this is Todd Haberkorn as the villainous Apos, his voice dripping with venomous obsession in a way few voice actors can nail. Stop casting him as harem leads, Funimation, he's capable of much better than that. Also, I suppose Mimi sounds better in the dub, but that might just be my distaste for moe bleeding through, I'll take Jamie Marchi's sassy performances over Rie Kugimiya's distilled cutesiness any day. I digress. For a show as dry and dramatic as this I can't help but think that more nuanced performances would have been fitting, but the scripts and acting in both languages are pretty content to just skate by. On the surface, the whole package just looks dull and uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nIn case my lack of enthusiasm wasn't immediately apparent, I'll just come out and say it: I was not impressed by this series in the least. Looking at the concept on paper I can see where its modest popularity comes from, promising a sexy thriller with suspenseful battles, engaging mysteries and a unique mythos. Oh, and lots of fanservice, if that tickles your fancy. In execution, though, the series doesn't deliver. Out of all the possible reactions I was prepared for going into this series, the one thing I did not expect was that I would find it boring, and yet that is just what happened. The poor direction is undeniably a big part of it--for a show that seems to want to stand out, the fights and action sequences are pretty standard, no flair or finesse to keep the audience's interest. Even when the risk takes on a global scale the tension is nonexistent. Mnemosyne is at its best when it's being tongue-in-cheek, so why couldn't it just stick with that?\\n\\n\r\nStill, even with bland execution some shows can leave a positive impression if they put out a decent story. But nope, to call the story here mediocre would be generous. The entire first three episodes could be removed from the story altogether with only minimal rewriting and at virtually no detriment to the overarching story. The plot drags its feet through arc after inconsequential arc that often have little to do with the ridiculous mess that's eventually revealed to be the plot, and at the end of the day it seems to sincerely want the audience to take it seriously on some level. I couldn't help but think that this should have been a feature-length film if anything, maybe that would have given it some much-needed focus. We don't need to be repeatedly reminded that vodka means water in Russian without variation, thank you very much. Apos' final plan is absurd and pointless and half of his means have nothing to do with the end. Several twists are thrown in for no apparent reason except to make the plot more \"edgy\", and it gets really old really fast, especially when the straightforward direction gives every indication that this story really thinks it's actually going somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nMoreso than its poor plotting, this series falls flat in how it develops--and doesn't develop--its characters. For a centuries-old mystery woman, Rin is simpler and more transparent than she has any right to be. She's not unlikable, she has a respect for humanity and cares about the people who are close for her, but aside from getting angry every now and again she's pretty much static, with no hidden depths aside from a bit of backstory in the finale that doesn't really add anything to her character. Her partner Mimi actually gets more development, and that's not saying much. The side companions they pick up over the course of the series receive much the same treatment. Kouki, for instance, has an interesting backstory that the show conveniently tosses aside for most of his screentime only to pull it back to try to milk it for some last-minute drama. To make matters worse, they're not all that fun to watch. I know this is subjective, but if the show isn't going to make its characters complex and thoughtful the least it could do is make them energized. This show waffles incessantly between silly and serious, never sticking to one long enough to leave any kind of impression.\\n\\n\r\nI've nearly beaten this show to non-death, but I have to come back to the show's fanservice elements, because while I don't think the raunchy material is inherently bad, in execution it drops the show from bland and forgettable to just plain bad. I mentioned that the mythos somewhat justified the presence of fanservice in the show, and it does: the Angels are basically incubi, and while I won't spoil it, a certain pairing becomes part of a ritual that plays a key role in the series' conclusion. It's ridiculous, but with better execution I'd be willing to go with it. Rin using her sex appeal to get close to her targets on missions? That actually makes sense. Battles fought in minimal if any clothing? A bit much, but it happens. A security guard shoving Rin, the unknown and probably dangerous intruder, to the ground and trying to rape her on the spot without subduing her properly? This is getting stupid. Everyone in this show, be they human, Immortal or Angel, is ridiculously horny, to the point that it often gets in the way of their common sense. The series' oversexed nature extends well beyond what's justified by the tone and the mythos, it gets in the way of the story, and it becomes familiar so quickly that it ends up becoming just dull.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen plenty of series stand out positively for the amount of love and care that went into making them, but despite its unusual production history and somewhat interesting ideas Mnemosyne feels shockingly cold and apathetic. It baffles me that the makers of something so novel and daring could care so little for their baby, but that appears to be the case. It has no idea what kind of show it wants to be, the end result tries too hard to be edgy and not hard enough to be entertainingly over-the-top about it. It still has some funny moments and some cool moments, but they're not enough to be called a saving grace. The show had no right to turn out as bland as it did.",

            "content": "&ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumetachi&rdquo;, is a six episode series containing a mix of supernatural, science fiction and horror elements. What will no doubt strike most viewers about this series are its explicit horror and sexually tinted scenes. \r\nConsidering these horror and sex scenes, as well as the themes behind them, &ldquo;Menomosyne&rdquo; is only suitable for mature viewers. Those who do watch will be treated to a dark series that holds some very interesting references and concepts, both apparent from its visuals or integrated in its plot.\r\nThe series' time frame spans over sixty years, the first episode showing us events that occurin 1990 while the last episode takes place in 2055. Some flashbacks even give us a glimpse of events involving the main characters that took place many centuries ago. \\n\r\nThe story follows Rin and Mimi, the various people they encounters and the overarching plot around mysterious phenomenon involving Yggdrasil, everything is slowly unravelled piece by piece to come to a conclusion in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series, Rin and Mimi run a detective agency, as such the first episodes seem to be more independent mystery tales that reveal little about the girls' true nature and nearly nothing about the overarching plot. Gradually more pieces are added to the puzzle and the whole plot becomes clear during the final episode when its fully explained and the intention of those that were pulling the strings behind the shadows becomes clear. This can make the final revelations a bit of a paradoxical experience for the viewer. \\n\r\nOn one end, as everything is explained to the audience about the mystic nature of immortals, angels and Yggdrasil, it is rewarding to finally see the bigger picture of the series. On the other end since it was initially so vague that it seemed almost absent during the first episodes, most viewers who have developed a bond with the main heroines are more likely to focus on what becomes of them and may feel more alienated in regards of the overarching plot and its impact on humankind, even though it does involve the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may look like the horror and sexual scenes are there just as selling points to brand the series and fit it in the horror or sexually explicit category, an impression that could even be reinforced when one realizes the meaning behind most of this horror and lust towards the latter half of the series. Yet I found they end up giving the series more depth and add weight to its themes of (im)mortality and human desires. Not only do those scenes explicitly reference to psychological themes or hold sociological meaning, they also tell us more about the characters involved, which may cast a more grim light on some but makes them that much more interesting and involving characters. \\n\r\nMuch like the excessive horror and blood spilling in &ldquo;Elfen Lied&rdquo; served another purpose than just showing gore, which became clear as the series progressed and ultimately gave it a deeper meaning, especially for its characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is rather small, which makes it easier for us viewers, seeing the limited number of episodes. Most are quite interesting, even when little is known about their pasts, the way they're presented and act shows more intricate and complex characters than the average bland two dimensional characters. Some even offer us quite daring and grim persona. \\n\\n\r\nRin of course gets the most attention and development, while Mimi is an interesting character, she clearly remains a supporting character to Rin.\\n\r\nBeing immortal, Rin especially seems to almost seek out situations where she will encounter physical harm, her body often suffering atrocious injuries. While Mimi is more reserved towards dangerous situations, like Rin she too is no stranger in seeking out the extremes of physical pleasure, certainly sexual pleasures. In the end it's made apparent that being immortal can also be seen as a curse, cut off from one of the very foundations of what it means to be human, one's mortality and finity, the girls can often only thrive or feel alive by seeking out extreme physical experiences and emotions, be it through suffering or pleasure. Paradoxically, their hearts and spirits are shown to remain as those of every other person, while somewhat desensitised towards certain concepts that normal mortal humans face, they became perhaps even more sensitive to others. When they are finally able to bond with someone and feel true emotions such as love, any joyful or painful emotions there seem to be felt even more vivid than for mortal humans.\\n\r\nMore disturbing in that aspect, no doubt intentional, was the emotional torture executed on some of the characters, showing that physical pain while great and lethal, can still pale in comparison to mental anguish for which no true deliverance exists, especially when there is no deliverance to be found for it by death.\\n\\n\r\nPortrayed as a strong female lead, who is not only smart and cunning but has terrific martial art skills, Rin is voiced by Mamiko Noto, whose subdued and soft voice could be seen as ill fitting but actually offers a nice contrast and adds indispensable depth to Rin's character by making her not only appear more serene and experienced, but also gives her the aura of a soothing mother figure. This gives Rin a believable mix of strength and vulnerability, of passion and serenity, of distance and attachment.\\n\\n\r\nMimi's character seems a bit more standard but also turns out to be quite interesting. Mimi's bond to Rin seems to be quite deep and even amorous at the start of the series, but later on those amorous and lustful feelings seem to have given way to a deeper and different attachment. Ultimately Mimi fights to protect and save Rin, the way Rin had once fought to save her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile the bloody horror scenes should still be stomachable by most, the sadism exhibited in some scenes can be stomach churning. Some characters are repeatedly tortured and mutilated in such sadistic ways, it forms a dark and dire sketch of the inhumanity and levels of sadism some can display.  It may seem a gratification or even celebration of sadism, inflicting pain and sexual abuse. A theme that was also touched upon in &ldquo;Higurashi No Koro Ni&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nNext to the horror, there are many sexual themes and sexually tinted scenes, from near explicit sex scenes to the mutual effect immortals and angels have on each other. All immortals are women and the only real treat to their immortality are angels, males that posses superhuman strength offset by an extremely short lifespan. Devoid of any logical and normal reasoning, angels act as wild beasts that seek out immortals and devour them. Immortals are vulnerable to angels due to their overwhelming physical reaction to them, when close to one, they become utterly defenceless and lust to be embraced by them.\\n\r\nThe sexual references are quite obvious, men are referred to as mindless beasts whose power is to subjugate and conquer women, women who regardless of their own powers such as continuing the circle of life, become lustful creatures unable to resist men.\\n\\n\r\nIts story also expanding into the future, &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; shows us an interesting view of mankind's future with a contemporary spawned idea of how the digital world permeate and eventually blend in with the real world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation by Xebec and Genco throughout all the episodes is good, with most focus on the female characters and the realistic, detailed backgrounds. The difference in care and attention of the animation between different scenes can be apparent sometimes. In some scenes where naked bodies are shown, they are not always drawn that well. Some of the horror scenes that would have been too gory and no longer look convincing enough if directly shown, use clever tricks of shading and suggestion. \\n\r\nOverall, the animation of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is good, though I did miss a bit of the beautiful animation of Rin and Mimi in the last episode, near the ending sequence, it didn't seem as well cared for as in prior episodes. On many occasions the animation of Rin and Mimi is quite sublime, such as the view of Rin leaning against a stone pillar in the opening sequence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is fairly good, the hard rock track accompanying the opening sequence immediately sets the trend for the more raunchy and hard hitting horror and sexual parts of the series. The remainder of the soundtrack does a good job at setting the mood and accompanying what happens on screen, though a more eerie soundtrack could have worked just as well but risked making the series a bit too dark.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; to those who want to see an engaging story with an interesting lead character and aren't afraid of gore or sexually tinted scenes because regardless of those scenes, they emphasise some of the more interesting themes the series holds. And if you're watching it just for the horror and nudity, you'll no doubt be satisfied as well.",

            "content": "\u201cThe gift of life is a fleeting precious thing. It is not something to be toyed with.\" - Asogi Rin\r\nSex, violence & alcohol. These three things are some of the most prominent in Mnemosyne, and while it may not be as gory as say, Elfen Lied, this series isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. \r\nOriginally I went into this thinking it was mostly consisted of copious amounts of torture scenes, gore, and sex scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be so much more than that.\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\r\nMnemosyne follows the lives of two immortal private detectives, Asogi Rin and Mimi,as they take on various assignments. The series actually span several decades (around 60 years, or so), with each episode skipping quite a few years. Because of this, we see the world and the characters in it change as time goes on, while Rin and Mimi stay the same. \\n\r\nThe consulting agency at which the two main characters work at make for \u201cmonster of the week\u201d-type episodes, with seemingly unrelated events. However, as the story goes on, we see how it all fits together, and as we learn more about Apos\u2019 (the main antagonist) true motives, we uncover more answers about immortality and the \u201cnon-mortal world\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you will encounter so many unanswered questions that it may seem confusing or intimidating to continue watching, but as the episode goes on, the writers do a good job of explaining most things, however not without leaving you with more questions. \\n\r\nThis element of mystery and never really knowing what\u2019s really going on, or what\u2019s going to happen next will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe very first thing you\u2019ll see is the opening sequence, which to be honest isn\u2019t anything all that great. It\u2019s more or less your standard \u201ccharacter montage\u201d, with some pretty weird stuff and some fanservice thrown into the mix. \\n\r\nAlready in the first scene you\u2019ll see one of the characters wearing nothing but an unbuttoned shirt, while running across a rooftop. This sort of \u201cfanservice\u201d is present throughout the entire series, but because of the way it is done, it never feels as if it\u2019s forced, or takes away from what\u2019s actually happening. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019ll be a lot of times where the characters are naked, whether it be during a  fight scene or during one of the many sex scenes. Yes, there are actual sex scenes in Mnemosyne, something you don\u2019t see in a lot of anime (though here it\u2019s 90% lesbian sex). \\n\r\nOfcourse there are some scenes where the characters might be perverted just for the sake of being perverted, but most of the time it all fits in rather well with what\u2019s actually happening, and it doesn\u2019t take away from the experience at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the art, it\u2019s rather well done, actually. I liked the character designs (especially the choice of physically portraying Mimi as a teenager), and the changes made to the characters as the years passed were nice, as they\u2019d really show that the characters do age, but you were still able to tell who was who. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetics are also well done, and somewhat change throughout the episodes, but nothing really major (though I suppose architecture don\u2019t change that much in 60 years). However, once again you can see that this is a totally different time than the previous episode, and how civilization has advanced.   \\n\\n\r\nThe animations were fluid, and there was not a moment where I felt like it seemed \u201cstale\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nOne of the first things I noticed when I started watching (and it didn\u2019t take me very long) was Kugimiya Rie as the voice of Mimi. Having only heard her voice characters who are a lot more aggressive (and overall very tsundere), Mimi was quite a nice \u201cchange of pace\u201d so to speak. While she\u2019s not very aggressive, she has a more \u201cchildlike\u201d voice than Rin does, and this fits very well with her character design. \\n\r\nThe rest of the voice actors did an overall good job, and there wasn\u2019t really someone who stood out as \u201cthat character with the lame voice acting\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \u201cAlsatia\u201d, and the ending theme, \u201cCause Disarray\u201d, are both performed by Galneryus, and since they\u2019re both very much done in the same \u201cstyle\u201d, it makes them sound very similar. I can\u2019t say I really liked these songs at first, but near the end of the series I\u2019d gotten used to them, and I guess this is very much a preferential thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was often rather \u201ccalm\u201d, or had a very casual feel to it, which was quite the interesting contrast to the themes shown in the series. This didn\u2019t feel like a bad thing, though, and I quite enjoyed the music. One small problem I had with it, however, was that the background music pretty much stays the same for the majority of the series, and I feel like it would\u2019ve been nice if it had changed as the years passed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe characters are obviously a big part of this series. The two main characters (and their dog) stay the same throughout the series, as everyone else ages. This does not only apply to appearances, but there isn\u2019t really much development for most of the series regarding these two characters. Instead, the show focus more on the backstory, giving us flashbacks now and then, revealing small parts of their past. I thought this was interesting, since the immortals would\u2019ve probably lived for a very long time, and it could be fun to see their past experiences (unfortunately, not much is revealed about their past lives, aside from the parts important to the plot).\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode (more or less) introduces a couple new characters to the cast. These characters are usually pretty young when they\u2019re first introduced, meaning they stay around for a an episode or two. Because of the short amount of time these characters are given (as opposed to Mimi & Rin), it\u2019s important to make them as interesting as you can with the given time. \\n\r\nI felt like the writers did a good job with this, as there were times when I\u2019d certainly \u201cfeel\u201d for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are quite varying, and they\u2019re all rather likeable and interesting, and without this aspect I feel the show would\u2019ve been much worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Mnemosyne, and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be such a more interesting anime than just \u201ca bunch of sex and violence\u201d (even if those things are certainly present). Though once again, I\u2019d not recommend this show if you\u2019re susceptible to gore or overall nudity... \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Interesting storytelling \u201cmechanics\u201d (having the story span decades).\\n\r\n+ Several twists and events to keep you interested.\\n\r\n+ Good art and animation.\\n\r\n+ Makes use of fanservice, as opposed to just \u201chaving it there\u201d.\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack makes for a nice contrast to the visuals.\\n\r\n+ Interesting character cast.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Too many unanswered questions at once may leave you very confused.\\n\r\n- Opening and ending themes have a very specific \u201cstyle\u201d to them, may not be for everyone.\\n\r\n- Soundtrack doesn\u2019t change all too much with the time skips.\\n\r\n- The levels of violence and nudity may turn you away if you\u2019re not prepared.",

There aren't too many shows that I watch and actually have to say.....\"Wow, thats fucked up...\" Last one was either Berserk or Ninja Scroll.  This isn't a kids show by any means.\r\nStory:  I've only gotten one episode in, but there are allusions to a deeper running plot.  My expectation is for mostly episodic content until probably the 5th ep.  There will be more and more revealed until that point, but the 5th and 6th should be true story.  Thats fine and as long as the story iseventually fleshed out while still being entertaining, its all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: what else would you expect from a show with this much gore and yuri but great art.  Its sexy, and I'm talking about more than the boobies. XP  It has a very dark feel and definitely needs to be watched full screen in a dark room.  The higher the quality the better.  Some good effects and tons of detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoy the sound of the actors, and putting such a cute voice on Mimi is hilarious when you realize she isn't as innocent as she seems.  The OP is also great, sadly I don't tend to pay too much attention to them.  Something other that cheery Jpop is always nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'm having a lot of fun with these guys.  We've got the two &quot;ladies&quot; who are obviously bi, a somewhat wimpy and confused guy, and enough alcohol to drown them all in.  It actually looks like some care was put into these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Hey, this is a blast.  Some good laughs )though I'm sure that some of the humor will be lost on the younger watchers (Seriously....if your mommy tucks you in at night...you really shouldn't be watching this...even if you are 30).  There is a certain something that can be said for the experience of curing a hangover with liberal drinking.  Theres gore, well-played nudity, dry humor, action, sexual innuendo, sadism and more.  What else could you want?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  If this continues to deliver it may very well be my favorite new show, and perhaps make it up there with some of my longtime favorites.  Only time will tell.",

            "content": "Violence, sex, and torture. That's what Mnemosyne is about. It favors style over substance, and shock value over both. For those of you seeking bloody fighting and lesbian sex scenes: rejoice! Mnemosyne: Daughters of Mnemosyne delivers both. For those seeking a well told story along with the fulfillment of these more primal desires: don't get your hopes up.\r\nThe protagonist of the story, Rin, runs a consulting agency with her partner (insert double entendre) Mimi. Rin is the cool and collected field agent, while Mimi is the playful flirtatious girl who helps out by being a computer hacker. Through the course of the series, there area number of other important characters they meet and work with that you won't be able to keep track of because after the second episode the show tends to skips years or decades between each. While it is somewhat interesting to see the progression of technology across decades, it serves little purpose except to allow certain characters to age and have children in a show with limited run time. Unfortunately, this means the viewers have little time to get attached to a character before they are killed off, so we can't empathize with Rin and Mimi's loss. Did I mention that Rin and Mimi are immortal? Well they are, and they don't age, so they will remain hot and young so we aren't grossed out when they have lots of lesbian sex (often with other immortal lesbians).\\n\\n\r\nThere is an overarching plot to the story, but it is presented only very gradually until the final episode suddenly springs the whole thing at us. In the meanwhile, Rin and Mimi, sometimes with the help of other people they know whom we can't remember if they have been introduced, solve puzzling cases that are obtuse even in their resolution. Not that the final outcome of the individual cases matter at all to the larger picture, since the tangential link between them tends to be the involvement of a particular family (genetic, not criminal), and that another immortal often appears in order to kill Rin for reasons that are never explained, although there are repeated mentions of someone named Apos who seems to be manipulating something and being cruel and sadistic about it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is very dark, probably to convey the omnipresent brooding and ominous atmosphere of the series. For an OVA from 2008, the animation and art is good but unspectacular. Voice acting is generally well done, and the opening and closing are appropriately gritty, if not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, while Mnemosyne is a reference to the mythological Greek river of memory, the impetus behind the story is Yggdrasil, which is the world tree from Norse mythology.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the relatively average score that I have given it; \u201cRin: Daughters of Mnemosyne\u201d (or \u201cMnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumi-tachi\u201d) is ANYTHING but an average, run-of-the-mill anime. This is a disturbing, startling, adult-only watch complete with regular intervals of rape, torture, nudity, and symbolic themes that only people familiar with Greek Mythology would understand. However, DoM is advertised as far more than just a show that throws blood and sex around willy-nilly to pander to the audience; it claims that every torture scene, every rape scene, and every nudity scene serves an actual purpose. Supposedly, these themes are not contrived andserve as a legitimately vital element to the narrative. Now, whether that advertisement is true or not, that\u2019s another matter entirely. So: Is this tale of immortals and angels just a cheap, mindless, pandering piece of trash that\u2019s only good for shock value, or is it a well-written and well-thought out masterpiece that is drastically underrated? The truth, in my opinion, is somewhere in between.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Rin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for, *cough, \u201cwater\u201d, and a talent for attracting things that cause her tremendous amounts of pain and suffering. The series follows Rin over the course of sixty-five years as well as the nightmarish events that she gets herself involved in as she tries to discover the truth behind her own immortality. The mastermind behind her tortured existence is a being known as Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil (the tree of all life). Rin is no stranger to the realm of the dead, but if Apos has his way, her next visit could be her last.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I have very mixed feelings about. When the show decides to focus on the lives of Rin and her partner Mimi and their work as private investigators trying to unravel the mystery of their own immortality, the show works very well as an adult supernatural-detective thriller. The unique presentation of the anime does wonders for its pacing as there are only six total episodes, each one twice as long as a normal episode. Every episode is followed by a large time skip; a plot element that also works in the show\u2019s favor. While the environment, the people, and the technology around our main characters change drastically, Rin and Mimi always stay the same. This is a very nice technique that puts the character\u2019s immortality in perspective; there is no denying that there is some very nice writing going on in this series. The show presents us with an intriguing mystery and slowly unravels it overtime, just like a good mystery anime should. These parts of the show are definitely where it shines the brightest.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, for every element that DoM does well, it also does an element wrong. Very wrong. In this case, I am referring to the way that this show handles its more mature themes. I\u2019m no prude who automatically looks down on any overtly sexual content in an anime, but some of DoM\u2019s  \u201cmature\u201d plot elements are just plain silly and childish. For example, without spoiling too much, consider how immortal women act whenever an angel is nearby; who thought that turning the immortals into horny sex-dolls with no willpower was a good idea? The whole \u201cbang-me then kill-me thing\u201d is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously; it doesn\u2019t serve the narrative and kills the tone of the show. There is simply no reason for this plot element to exist, and it is not the only thing out of place. Virtually everything in this show based around Yggdrasil (google it) is just poorly executed, overly complicated, and unnecessarily sexual. The fact that it\u2019s full of mythological allusions does nothing to change to the fact that it is poorly written and rushed at times; the backstory and actual function of some of the supernatural elements aren\u2019t explained very well and minor plotholes exist throughout. In the end, what we end up with is a very mixed package. Sometimes the plot works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. All in all, it\u2019s decent and certainly unique compared to what anime are normally about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also a mixed bag. The protagonists, Rin and Mimi, are definitely the two best characters. Rin, particularly, is the complete package; she has legitimate/complex motivations, a distinct personality, and receives development. Mimi doesn\u2019t receive the same development that Rin does, but she is also multi-faceted. The viewers get a very good sense of the bond that these two have with each other and their chemistry is very apparent; the protagonists are definitely the highlight of the show. The antagonists on the other hand, are unimpressive to say the least. Apos has no motivations what so ever and the motives behind pretty much everything that he or his underlings do can be chalked up \u201cbecause I\u2019m evil! Mwhahahah!\u201d We are simply never given a substantial reason for anything he does, and when we are, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. The side characters are an interesting case because we actually get to see them age throughout the series. Their relationships with Rin and Mimi are some of the strong points of the show because the audience gets to see these characters (who the girls have grown attached to) get older and older until they eventually die. This helps the burden of immortality hit home with the viewers. Despite the lack of any complex antagonistic force, the characters of DoM is where the anime strives the most.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne has some great ideas, but it loses sight of them because it is trying too hard to be mature. If it had dropped the whole idea of angels and the idea of adding in Apos as a horribly confused villain (as well as the copious sexual situations that go along with it), this could have been a damn good show. Unfortunately, it ends up coming across as too inconsistent and a bit incoherent. If you are in the mood for something drastically different from the norm, then I guess DoM isn\u2019t a bad watch. However, I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to recommend it nor would I suggest that you get your hopes up; it\u2019s simply a decent change-of-pace anime at best.",

I\u2019m very disappointed since I really wanted to enjoy Mnemosyne that at first, I was very willing to ignore whatever flaws it had. It\u2019s too bad that the negative aspects vastly outweigh the positive ones.\r\nBefore I go into the details of why Mnemosyne didn\u2019t appeal to me very much, I\u2019d like to state the things that I did enjoy. The opening song is one of them. I enjoy it so much that I barely skipped it. I'd evengo far as to say that it was the most enjoyable thing in the anime. The visual aspect of the opening was mediocre and just plain boring. The other thing that I enjoyed, or at least tried to, is the main character, Rin. Rin seemed to be the protagonist that I was always looking for in anime, which is why I badly wanted Mnemosyne to be good. She was the perfect mix of cool and bad ass and I really did like her character design,  but eventually, she just failed to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with this anime is the lack of development. Everything from the plot to the characters was left unexplained. They fail to show what the main characters motivations are. This isn\u2019t just exclusive to the main characters, it goes for every character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are just meh. The show barely has any entertaining fight choreography and opts for guns and explosions. The most interesting fight scene in Mnemosyne is in the first episode and gets worse as the shows progress. In fact, the previous sentence describes the entire anime perfectly as the animation and stories descend far below pathetic by the last episode. The soundtrack is completely lackluster and seems to have been pulled straight from stock soundtrack library. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it was mainly a waste of time. The only other thing I felt while watching this show aside from boredom was frustration.",

If I haven't believed in the sincerity of the creators I wouldn't bring myself to finish it. \r\nArtwork is nice, the usual oav quality. Storytelling is consistently boring. The issue of immortality and long time span of the oav brings in lots of potential that's rarely tapped into. There are a few plot twists which tends towards a home run then gets lost quickly. \r\nMost interesting things are the main character Rin and background details as the time goes on. A few lifestyle changes and interfaces are introduced in later episodes, but it has been used way better inGits:Sac and they don't effect the flow of the story much. It's not as gory and sexually exploitive as people seem to think . \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I felt that Mnemosyne would have worked way better in a 26 ep. series assuming some inspiration comes into play and it gets further developed.",

            "content": "First off, I would like to say, that FUNamations description does not do this series the justice it deserves.\r\nStory 9/10 - Mnemosyne, is kind of like the movie \"The Shining\", absolutely god awful, but if you pay attention to it, and put a little thought and research into it, you will see that it is actually a misunderstood master piece. Just like in \"The Shining\" there are actually multiple stories being told simultaneously. It is telling the tale of Japan and it's struggles after the nuclear bombs had been dropped, the Greek mythological tale of Mnemosyne(goddess of memory and remembrance) and her children, and thestory of a detective(who becomes a daughter of Mnemosyne), trying to piece all of these elements together. What did not like about this series is that there was a huge plot hole, that threw me off. And I find it didn't attract as many viewers  because of the aggressive and what most would believe to be pointless sex scenes, which derails the story for the eyes of people not looking for its complex dimensions.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 -The art was pretty average for this type of anime for the first half, but what was really good about it was the animation. Very fluid like transition between frames, no \"Blur frames\" or \"Half frames\" . But once the Greek Mythology story comes more into play the, the art becomes more detailed and ominous. The mysterious looking skies with a transient look, like water colors of a sunset painting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 -The music was very well placed throughout the series, every song was well placed with the themes of the actions that were taking place throughout the series, the one thing that kind of was bothersome, is that some of the songs sounded like something that was used in a corny 80's film. The OP and ED were definitely suiting to the themes of emotional and physical torture, and the abuse part, but nothing really creative along the lines of being original. The voice actors actually did a very good job on the English Dub. The voices weren't annoying as they tend to be English dubs and they did a fair job of getting the feeling they were trying to convey to the audience, and they didn't use unnecessary formalities, using apostrophes for omission(\"It's\" instead of \"It is\").  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10 -Rin is really the only character that has a solid dynamic nature through out the OVA's. Though Koki Maeno and Mimi, do some changing themselves through out the series, Rin is the only characters whose change is consistent through out it, the others seem to just change dramatically half-way through, as a significant amount of time passes. First time I watched this, Rin's character got kind of annoying, she comes into the series like a total bad ass, and ends it with her tail between her legs, that part really got to me. But when I watched it a second time, third time etc, I saw that to complete the story they wanted to tell it was a necessary plot tool.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 -Not going to lie, the first time I watched  this anime, I was absolutely appalled by the amount of sexual content and lack of story content. It wasn't until that I heard from a friend that I should re-watch it after reading up a bit on Greek Mythology and the story of the goddess of Mnemosyne. After doing that, I find little wonders hidden through out it, that I didn't see before, and it happens each time I watch it. In the end it was because of this anime, that I began to develop an interest in it again I have been able to get quite a number of people to start watching it as well, I also happen to own a copy of this anime as well, I liked it so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.4/10 -Overall, this anime is definitely got something in it for everybody; action, orgies, mythology, Sci-fi, comedy and a little bit of romance in the end. I give a strong recommendation to check it out with an open-mind and attention to detail for full enjoyment.",

Or is it doing all of that to cover up terrible script writing, characters coming out of nowhere (or in this case bloody orifices), animation that takes a sharp nose-dive after the first episode, cacophonous sound track, and the use of graphic sexual and violent elements to keep us in the dark to the fact that after six episodes nothing's reallyhappened.\\n\\n\r\nYou follow Rin, an immortal woman, along her life.

            "content": "This is the first complete OVA anime I've seen and, without a doubt, one of the best animes out there. Just a first glance at this anime's early sequences and it's clear that this one is just not for anyone. Mnemosyne contains the whole package: nudity, profanity, strong language, strong sexual themes and intense violence. So discretion is advised, this anime is exclusively for mature audiences.\r\nWell that being said let's start with the story. Normally a anime this long would have been separated in 12 or 13 episodes, so why is this anime cut into  6 - 45 minute OVAS? The answer is simple:is easier and less confusing to manipulate and separate time in 6 parts that it is on 12 or 13. Almost every OVA occurs in a different time lapse, the space however remains normally the same happening the main events in Shinjuku, Nagoya and Kyoto. Sometimes the location is changed by the flow of the story but mainly everything starts up within this cities. The OVAs divide in 5 different time epochs:\\n\r\n1st OVA - 1990\\n\r\n2nd OVA - 1991\\n\r\n3rd OVA - 2011\\n\r\n4th OVA - 2025\\n\r\n5th and 6th OVA - 2055\\n\\n\r\nOVAs 1,2,3 and 4 consist in different arcs regarding story. The 5th and 6th set the conclusion and finish the anime. Each OVA alone is so impressive that you'll make haste to watch the next one. The story is manly about the life of a immortal being, Asogi Rin and her assistant Mimi. At first in seens that Rin is just a common private detective, but as the storyline develops and the main events unfold you will discover who she really is and why she is immortal. \\n\\n\r\n-THE NEXT THREE PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN SPOILERS REGARDING THE MAIN STORYLINE (+OVA 3)-\\n\\n\r\nBasically the story revolves around the nordic legend of the \"Yggdrasil\", tree of life. This legend says that this tree's roots mantain united the two worlds, the world of the mortals and the world of the immortals. And if a woman, only a woman takes one of the tree's fruit it will become immortal, while a man will become a monster and die in eternal agony. This legend is a bit changed here: the men become \"angels\" (monsters with red wings) and are forced to fornicate with the females which are, at the same time, inexplicably sexualy atracted to the males. After the male has satisfied his sexual desire he must kill the female in order to be able to continue his sorrowful existence by eating the Yggdrasil fruit inside the female.\\n\\n\r\nAsogi Rin does not remember when did she consume the Yggdrasil fruit, in fact every certain lapse of time she forget's her memories due to Eipos (the main antagonist) influence. Sometimes when you begin watching a OVA you will not understand what's going on but the event sequence is so well put that in no time you will be enjoying the continuation of the OVA even if you don't know what's going on. And in the end the connection between the confusing and the certainty will arrive sooner or later, but it does appear in such a natural way that you won't even notice it. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to point out is that you will be seeing these fruits falling from the sky all the time during the anime as well as the Yggdrasil far away on the edge of the city. I think it's kind of cool because it get's you more attached to Rin knowing that you can see what she sees. So in the end the story is amazingly well put. The changes in the legend, the different time spaces and some flashback (inputted smartly in some of the OVAs) just make one of the best storylines come alive and deliver a ultimate experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, spaces and locations are terrific. All the anime occurs mainly in some specific cities and some time it diverts to some other locations in order to fulfill certain objectives in the story. It sounds anoying to be always located in the same city, but this is when the time dividing aspect does it's job. In the first two OVAs you won't notice anything different, having only passed one year between them, but in the third OVA you will witness the changes in the demographical, technological and style aspects. These changes are so well driven that you will be impressed on how things changed from just one OVA to another and wonder what else is going to change afterwards. Note that the last two OVAs (5th and 6th) do share the same timeline of events as well. This is undertandable, being this two final OVAs the ones that contain the main storyline and define the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMnemosyne art is also focused on the horror, gore, bloody and sexual aspects. The dark theme in this anime is mantained on all the episodes development and does make feel one really anxious about what is going to happen next. Gore and blood are evident in this anime. From the scandalous turns and events in the anime (wich include from body dismembering to genital-piercing tortures) to the ending song theme (Cause Dissaray), this anime will result a feast for those who love violence. In the sexual aspect this show contains just enough content to almost fall into the Hentai genre. Nudity, mid-detailed sex scenes and, from time to time, pedofile sex escenes will be a often ocurrence here.\\n\\n\r\nAltasia and Cause Disarray are just the best opening-ending combination I've listened to. Normally all animes Open with a really good and powerful song but then the ending just becomes a slow and weak song that has a cool-down role. Differently from other animes, Mnemosyne both, opening and ending, are strong an powerful songs (of course my criteria funtions by my musical preferences: metal, rock, etc.). These two songs manage to create a feeling of a never ending struggle, a neverending story, this matches perfectly the immortal theme. \\n\\n\r\nPassing now to the battle soundtracks I really can't get enough of the main battle theme. I mean is just so original and really does go in when it has to. The rest of the BMGs are overall good and do a well job adding more spice to the OVAs. Another thing is the  japaneese voice acting, I mean Rin's voice sounds sexy and clear no wonder why, she's interpreted by Noto Mamiko (Ichinose Kotomi in Clannad, Yuka in Elfen Lied, Hecate in Shakugan no Shana, Shihou Matsuri in sola and the popular Emma Ai in Jigoku Shoujo). So it all comes down to if the music plays good in conjuction with the anime, well it actually it does, and it does rock hard without the anime as well: perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of characters in this anime. I'm in love with Rin, she's just so sexy. She's drawn to attract the male audience: exotic hair colour, big eyes, beautiful face, huge breasts and perfect all around body. The other characters are given least importance but are well drawn as well. Mimi is gorgeous too. She target's the other part of the male audience which likes a more clasic teen look: a not too llamative hair colour, moderate breast size, small body, and a all around teen look. Now the personalities are exotic and different. Mimi has the naughty-teen personality and tends to practice lesbianisn sex in one or two episodes. Rin is a special case: her main personality is quiet, confident and seductive when the situation requires it. But at some specific moments her personalitie suffers changes due to memory loss. So you will see her one episode as a loving girlfriend, then (almost all the time) as a detective or as a sexual goddess.\\n\\n\r\nA mix between a unforgetable story, over the top artistic quality, impressive soundtrack and wonderful and appealing characters gives Mnemosyne a HUGE onjoyment factor that transforms it into a ''must see\" OVA-Anime. This anime will challenge your senses, unleash your hidden desires and replenish your most gory and bloody necessities. Now the only question you must ask yourself now  is: are you ready to start watching Mnemosyne-Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi?",

            "content": "These are elements in most things media that you as the viewer are attracted to or appalled to and in this case, there are many anime that is clearly not meant for everyone and it\u2019s not just the pointless fan service anime or the very, very nauseating hentai titles but more titles that are too risqu\u00e9 for TV but instead went into the OVA format and that is where Rin Daughters of Mnemosyne come to mind and when first hearing about it based on most reviews and just shootin\u2019 the shit with some people, some say it\u2019s either good, perverted, creepy, etc. but then again,I\u2019ve been reviewing anime for two years now and I have seen way worse material than what they describe and so I went inside an open mind and that\u2019s all I wrote.\\n\\n\r\nRin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for vodka and a talent for attracting things that go bump in the night. In a series of nightmarish vignettes spanning sixty-five years, Rin\u2019s lush body is sadistically pierced, blown up, and mulched to a bloody pulp. The fiend behind her tortured existence is Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, the tree of all life. While Rin struggles to unravel the secrets of her endless agony, Apos lurks in the shadows, eager to tear into her ripe body and devour the memories of her countless lives. Rin\u2019s no stranger to the realm of the dead, but her next visit could last forever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the result was that the show was\u2026\u2026while it has very strong sexual and erotic themes and there is copious amounts of graphic violence in the show, I didn\u2019t really feel that creeped out by it because in actuality, those themes fit within the show without it being played for shock value. Like I said, I have seen much worse than this. Elfen Lied, I feel was creepy, pretentious, and only being played for shock value for most of the part and also it fits the context. It doesn\u2019t seem out of place or inappropriate that you wonder what the hell you just watch. The story does introduce immortals, which most people are familiar with if they saw Baccano! And believe me, Rin gets in most situations where any person would just up and die. However, while Rin is an immortal, I did felt like she was in real danger most of the storyline does go through 5 timelines from the 1990s to 2011 to the very near future of 2055 within the span of 6 45-minute episodes, the pacing was smooth as when an episode end, it feels more conclusive and episodic at least for the first 4 episodes and while it has that monster or bad guy of the week (actually, year) format, it never felt as tiring or easily bored. As of what I thought about the main plot, I was confused at some times but then again, like most shows, I get the idea just about a few episodes in and it is an interesting yet devious plot.\\n\\n\r\nI do like the duo of Rin Asogi and her assistant Mimi as likable characters although while everything around them change, from cities to people to technological advances, they actually don\u2019t considering that I always remember the line of when Rin wants some water and Mimi gives her Vodka and says, \u201cVodka is Russian for water\u201d and that is repeated for the first 4 episodes. The Maeno family are the most interesting characters as you see different variations of them from Koki to his son Teruki and to Teruki\u2019s daughter Mishio and it does show how well-connected they are to Rin and Mimi. Apos, the main antagonist of the show, isn\u2019t exactly as textbook \u201ctake over the world\u201d villain as I thought. He does it with sex and murder.\\n\\n\r\nXebec is in charge of the animation and while I had my gripes with them on a few titles that I either watched and/or reviewed, this is definitely a far cry from the usual material they often make. The art style and animation is fine with the setting within the in-universe changing from either a year or two to 10 to 50 years. The gore and violence factor is very high so this is definitely not recommended for those who have weak constitutions or not much of a gore/violence fan.\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really love the opening theme and I also thought the ending song was decent but not exactly high on my list as the opening and ending are both sung by Galneryus and while I like it, I can\u2019t really say it fits to the show although some of the time, it does.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the English dub, the FUNimation dub leaves me not wholly satisfied as while Colleen Clinkenbeard was perfectly cast as Rin, I seriously can\u2019t picture Jamie Marchi as Mimi. I like Marchi as a voice actress and I appreciate her going for a role outside of how she\u2019s usually cast but she sounded kind of screechy in her role. Todd Haberkorn manages to give a decent performance as Apos and all around, the dub is\u2026.well, the FUNimation standard of dubs.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: In short, I really enjoyed watching this show. I like that while it does have those themes I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, it manages to fit with the context of the show and not feel out of place and if the show creeped you out, then the show did what it needed to do. I guess if you are a fan of shows like this, then this is made for you.",

            "content": "Well, we're nearing the end of yuri anime month and so far the only anime I've watched that was completely new to me was Yuru Yuri. So I'm taking a risk this week and watching Mnemosyne. Written by Onogi Hiroshi who also wrote several episodes of Rahxephon, that can't be a bad sign, and the anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist. Of course, he was also involved in the completely unimpressive Aquarion anime and there is a big difference between adapting the work of others decently and being able to write your own. It's from Xebec and Genco, both of whom have done some really goodand really bad work. So, I have no idea what to expect. Let's take a look and find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually really simple. The Nordic world tree, Yggdrasil, exists. It releases spores that make women immortal and men into short lived angels. The story follows two immortals, Mimi and Rin, as they fill their time solving mysteries for humans over several decades and eventually face the greatest mystery they're aware of, the truth behind Yggdrasil. To be fair, there are some interesting ideas here and that's where my praise for the story is going to end because the execution is horrendous. The first issue you encounter is that the mysteries aren't interesting. What makes a mystery interesting is going through the deductive process to find the solution, even if you're being walked through by Sherlock Holmes or Harry Dresden. The issue with Mnemosyne is that there's no reasoning. They present the mystery, they go to informants, and then they're told the solution. There's no intrigue and nothing compelling about it. Yes, this isn't technically a mystery anime, but the boring \"investigations\" take up a lot of time and they never do anything interesting with them. I'm not going to go into great detail about the second issue that comes up since, frankly, it's really gross. All you need to know is this simple phrase \"sexualised torture scenes.\" Another major issue is that it's just boring. There are long stretches where nothing important happens and the first four episodes are really repetitive, all following the same basic arc. When something does happen it's generally not something that you'll want to see. Just reread the previous issue for the details. Then there's the romance, or more appropriately, sex scenes as the characters are given very little in terms of actual emotional connections. Obviously, my problem isn't with the yuri. What I do have a problem with is that a lot of these scenes have dubious consent or even lack consent completely. Yeah, these are real issues but where an anime like Berserk treats sexual assault seriously, Mnemosyne just has it as a thing that happens and never deals with the repercussions and it certainly isn't respectful for how horrible it actually is. I'll end with some story problems that aren't thoroughly unpleasant. One is going to be another issue with the romance, and that's that the romance that thankfully does have consent isn't developed very well. To give an example, two characters meet in one episode and have roughly a half dozen shared scenes. In the next episode they're married for no adequately explained reason and that, sadly, is the best that Mnemosyne does with the issue of love. This is an anime that doesn't establish its universe's rules very well. The final episode adds several new ones that were never mentioned or even alluded to. The result is that they seem to come out of nowhere. It's not quite a deus ex moment, but it comes really close. There's a lot of really stilted dialogue for the sake of exposition. Then there's the ending. I don't want to spoil it, just in case there's someone who still wants to watch it, but the ending is awful. It's rushed, it doesn't make sense, and it's really really really stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't exactly helpful. Yeah, great characters couldn't exactly save Mnemosyne from its myriad story issues, but they could at least make it somewhat bearable. The problem is that the characters are roughly as well done as the story. Most of them barely have personalities. Yes, the anime is short, but that's not an excuse. The Read or Die OVA is short too and it manages to have developed characters. Mnemosyne doesn't bother. The only three characters that I can really talk about beyond a very short description are Rin, Mimi and Apos and even they don't have a whole lot to them. Mimi is... supportive of Rin and good at hacking. Rin is... kind of a blank slate. She has a vaguely tortured past that barely gets touched on. She's always shown as being ready to help people who need it, but other than that her personality kind of varies based on what Hiroshi needs her to do for that episode. Apos spends most of the series being vaguely evil. You don't learn anything about his motivations until the final episode and it's not worth the wait. He ends up just being a really cliche villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, for the most part. A lot of the backgrounds are pretty plain but the character designs are pretty well done. My biggest issue is the massive amount of fan-service. A lot of it is just used for gratuitous sex scenes, but there are also the sexualised torture scenes that I'm trying not to mention because I care about you more than this anime does. The action scenes are pretty lazy. They tend to last for short bursts and several end abruptly without any kind of satisfying conclusion. Still, the art is probably the best part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move on to the voice acting. Now, I know for a fact that Kugimiya Rie, Ishida Akira and Noto Mamiko can not only act, but they can do it magnificently. I've heard each of them do it on multiple occasions. That being said, their performances in this aren't very good. Honestly, they don't even sound like they're trying. In fact, the only cast member who seems to be putting in any effort is Nazuka Kaori. That isn't to say that the acting is bad, it just seems like it's \"phoned in.\" The music is all rather underwhelming, sounding rather typical for a horror action series. Except for the themes, which involve heavy engrish and are kind of annoying. No, it's not funny engrish like Black Lagoon has. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor on this one has to be a 10/10. There are lesbian sex scenes. None of the women really develop an emotional connection and some of the scenes are just thrown in randomly, but you still can't get a whole lot more blatant than that without going into pornographic territory. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is Mnemosyne overall? Well, it has some ideas that could've been interesting and the art is pretty well done but the story is an absolute mess, the characters have very little personality and there's just no substance. I also have to wonder just who the target audience is. People who watch anime for a good story certainly won't find it here. It's definitely not funny. The action scenes aren't very good so action fans are out. It's labeled as horror, but there's nothing remotely frightening in the entire series so horror fans will be uninterested. Yuri fans might enjoy some of the sex scenes but will likely be disappointed by how little you get of actual relationships and by the fact that het ultimately plays a bigger role. It's probably too tame for torture porn fans, even though some of those scenes do get pretty graphic. I guess that just leaves the easily impressed and people who can be fooled by the illusion of substance, maybe people who want to watch torture porn and have some room for denial. If you're in one of those groups you might enjoy Mnemosyne, as for me I'm giving it a 1.4/10. Ultimately, the few good ideas don't make up for the complete lack of anything redeemable in the actual story or from the characters. If you want to see immortality mixed with other supernatural, mythical and sci-fi elements in a show that deals with sexuality and is actually competently done, check out the first two seasons of Torchwood. They're much better than this. Actually, the bad seasons of Torchwood are still better than this. Now, I need to watch something decent after that. So next week I'll end yuri anime month with a look at Sasameki Koto.",

Lots of gore and sex in this anime, there is at least a couple minute where Rin or even Mimi have to please this lesbo forinfomation in the last 2 episode.\\n\\n\r\nSome character appears in one episode as main focus and then they disappear completely. Other than that we know there is a cruel kid, Eipos, who seems to be another immortal, who is after Rin and Mimi. \\n\\n\r\nThey sure took their time into drawing the background in some part of the anime, and the music is good. Overall it is a good serie to watch probably just for the gore and sex, hopefully the story will improve.",

            "content": "A particular quirk to Japanese visual novels (story-based PC games) is the addition to extended graphic sex scenes to an otherwise PG or non-pornographic route. The fact is, beyond story, reputation, publicity and reason: sex sells best. This is a concept the creators of Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne seem to have wholeheartedly embraced. \r\nAfter buying another anime DVD from Amazon, I kept getting emails recommending Mnemosyne to me, but after reading some reviews I decided it was best to watch on Netflix instead. At six episodes, decided it wouldn't take up too much of my life - plus, if I didn't like it, I couldjust turn it off and not worry about what to do with a DVD I didn't want to watch. Unlike most anime, instead of being comprised of 25 minute episodes, Mnemosyne has an expansive 45 minutes per episode, meaning there is enough time to create an entire fully fleshed-out world and establish various characters despite the short series length. \\n\\n\r\nRin, the titular character (in more ways than one), runs a private detective business in the Tokyo district of Shinjuku. She deals with various cases with the help of her assistant Mimi. Thing is, being Magnum P.I. aside - Rin's immortal, and when she's not tracking down lost cats, she's getting involved in more supernatural mysteries that seem to find her whether she's on or off the map. What is the darkness haunting Rin - and is it the same force behind her inability to die? \\n\\n\r\nFrom backgrounds to finishing touches, Mnemosyne's art isn't really anything to write home about. The character designs along the same lines with generic crazy hair colours, big eyes and, yes, large breasts - I get second-hand backache just looking at this series. Similarly adequate is the music, apart from the opening song, which I skipped every time because I just couldn't stand it, but that is my bias. \\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that Mnemosyne's best quality is the use of time throughout the series. Recurring characters dare to do what many cartoon characters never do - age. And do they age! There is no better illustration of Rin's immortality than to have generations sweep past her as she stays the same, and the implied loneliness this creates. And it isn't just people who age - society and technology sprints along at every new episode. From totally immersive MMORPGs to intuitive virtual-reality shopping at a fingertip, this is one of the most intriguing aspects of the show, especially how it relates to Rin's investigations. Though I have to say - Rin, if you only get one case every twenty years, maybe it's time to consider a career change? \\n\\n\r\nFrom the best to the worst: the explicit porn and gore scenes. I felt that, like a VN, Mnemosyne should have had an option to turn these scenes off altogether as they added nothing to the plot, feeling nothing more than embellishment to attract freaks and their wallets than any kind of artistic or political endevour. There were many times I considered like closing the browser window when these scenes happened, and they do colour my ultimate perception of the show negatively. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, I thought the voice actors did very well with the material they were given. Whereas the majority of the cast didn't last more than a few episodes, they fit their roles well enough. Colleen Clinkenbeard deserves a special mention for her consistently natural delivery as Rin, even during more... challenging scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series presents some compelling mysteries and the setting and time-span are utelised effectively to create a unique perception of human impermanence from the eyes of one who cannot age. The evolution of technology throughout was also fascinating to watch. The ending's reveal on the nature of Rin's mysterious condition also drew from several mythical sources, suggesting that the creators had done a lot of research on ancient civilizations and their beliefs. Without giving too much away, I also appreciated the subversive attitude towards what we consider angelic beings - it felt like the first time Mnemosyne had dared to make a statement that wasn't explicitly sexual in nature. However, I felt that as much as the erratic, brave plot was a cartographer's delight, the pornography and gore are enough to take this series off the map for me. While Mnemosyne has potential, it is preoccupied with selling itself, and selling itself too cheap at that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAmazon.co.uk price: \u00a36.75 \\n\r\nLanguage: English, Japanese \\n\r\nSubtitles: English \\n\r\nNumber of discs: 2 \\n\r\nClassification: 18 \\n\r\nStudio: Manga Home Entertainment (UK) Ltd \\n\r\nDVD Release Date: 13 Sep 2010\\n\\n\r\nOriginally posted on marusamarento.wordpress.com",

            "content": "My first review or this site, and here on I plan to write reviews mostly to series that I feel are being unjustifiably bashed in previous reviews by other members.\r\nMnemosyne has been noticeably losing viewers as the numerous fanservice dedicated scenes become more evident, but since fanservice has become a staple in recent anime mostly due to commercial reasons, it is pointless to dislike a series based heavily on the amount and harshness of those.\r\nOne of the strongest points of the series is the interesting portrayal of immortal beings and the evolution of society and technology throughout the multiple decade time-skips between each episode, theaging of mortal characters and their long but passing relationship with the main characters. Compared to most other anime that do have long-living characters in their host, Mnemosyne presents a much more realistic and accurate view on the aspect, arguably comparable to that of the western classical RPG Vampire: The Masquerade.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists, while not presenting many, if any, noticeable original characteristics not seen in other works, manage to stay mysterious to the end, with very little of their motives, personalities and goals being apparent to the viewer, as well as their natures and origins, resulting in interesting but often small revelations occurring in every episode, successfully enticing the mind of the public.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists, as immortals, largely resist changes in personality and habits, and, as previously mentioned, maintain interesting relationships with the supporting cast, aware that those are fragile just as the lives of innumerous beings they have watched fade away throughout the ages, but also not treating them as disposable or of low value. Both are shown as having a substantial amount of knowledge, and as preserving the memories of those who were important to them. The main character's fighting ability is not as great as one would expect, but is overally consistent, without noticeable bursts of martial geniousness or inexplicable failures on sure-win situations.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Mnemosyne can be viewed as a like-it-or-hate-it series, as it's merits are notable, it also requires a lot from the viewer to be appreciated, specially on the western side of the globe, due to it's heavy graphics and plot. It might also become a vanguard work, opening more space for future similar anime to bloom.",

            "content": "Okay, this is my first anime review, bear with it.\r\nMnemosyne is a truly orginal anime. I have never seen anything like it ever before. Each episode takes place in a different time frame and jumps decades at a time from episode to episode. What's more, the surrounding environment changes along with it. Technology developes, buildings that were once prominent become dilapidated and destroyed and charaters age.\r\nThe story seems to be complicated at first, but once it ends, the whole picture seems to fall into focus. The story surrounds a woman named Rin Asogi who runs a consulting agency with her friend Mimi and pet dogGenta. The thing is, they are both immortal from a plant called Yggdrasil which releases spores that if entered into a woman, makes them immortal and they can live for practically forever. But if it enters a male, they become angels and can only live for a short amount of time. When both are near each other, the female is sexually attracted to the angel and asks of him to &quot;devour&quot; her. \\n\\n\r\nEventually, Rin meets Kouki Maeno in the first episode and throughout the series, the Maeno family becomes the key element in the story along with a demigod Eipos who is adiment on eating Rin's timespore.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is fantastic, although the memory flashbacks kind of make it hard to see and understand what is going on. But that is the point of it all, since memories can become fuzzy and hard to remember.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great since you can hear every action shot, explosion and gut-wrenching scene quite clearly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, they are well diverse and well thought out and have a different spin on personality as well as leaving some family resemblance when it comes to the Maeno family.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Although some spots become difficult to understand when you start each episode. But overall, it was very good to watch and I highly recommend it for those of you who enjoy something aside from mainstream anime and don't mind nudity, action, explosions, etc. \\n\\n\r\nMnemosyne is one of a kind.",

I do think there's more to the show than that, it tries to have an engaging plot beyond pure smut and the concept is actually a decent one that somewhat justifies the show's perverse tendencies. Setting aside any moral issues I might have with it, for the purposes of this review it's no different than any other kind of fanservice, especially since it's sort of justified by the show's mythos. That said, if frequent nudity, eroticmoaning and women being torn asunder in various and sundry ways is a deal-breaker for you, there's no need to read this review any further because Rin: Daughter of Mnemosyne has quite a lot of that going on. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals behind Mnemosyne are hit and miss. On one hand, the backgrounds are nice and detailed and the animation is pretty solid and consistent, but on the other the use of lighting varies wildly in quality and the character designs are a bit generic, sometimes even dipping into ugly. When it's too dark, scenes that should be gripping just come out drab, and when it's too bright they end up looking gaudy. The show occasionally strikes the right balance, but the lack of consistency can be distracting, and the choreography behind the fights are pretty lackluster to boot. It's not completely incompetent, there are some good moments, but most of the show's important action scenes tend to fall flat. Maybe I'm being too harsh, it's perfectly watchable and never looks bad, it just could've used more panache. At the very least, it has a few decent camera angles mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it'd be more compelling with better music, but it was not meant to be. Half the time the music doesn't really support the series, it just feels like it was slapped on at the end with barely any thought given. It's a perfectly good soundtrack that could have matched the tone the series was going for in theory, but there was clearly very little effort put into its integration, so the strained music direction is a real shame. Combined with the poorly executed visuals, it makes all the difference between these scenes being edge-of-your-seat thrilling and just \"stuff that happens\". I will say that the opening and ending are both hilariously bad Engrish songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in both languages is fine, perfectly serviceable all-around, but neither really tries to go beyond the call of duty. The exception to this is Todd Haberkorn as the villainous Apos, his voice dripping with venomous obsession in a way few voice actors can nail. Stop casting him as harem leads, Funimation, he's capable of much better than that. Also, I suppose Mimi sounds better in the dub, but that might just be my distaste for moe bleeding through, I'll take Jamie Marchi's sassy performances over Rie Kugimiya's distilled cutesiness any day. I digress. For a show as dry and dramatic as this I can't help but think that more nuanced performances would have been fitting, but the scripts and acting in both languages are pretty content to just skate by. On the surface, the whole package just looks dull and uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nIn case my lack of enthusiasm wasn't immediately apparent, I'll just come out and say it: I was not impressed by this series in the least. Looking at the concept on paper I can see where its modest popularity comes from, promising a sexy thriller with suspenseful battles, engaging mysteries and a unique mythos. Oh, and lots of fanservice, if that tickles your fancy. In execution, though, the series doesn't deliver. Out of all the possible reactions I was prepared for going into this series, the one thing I did not expect was that I would find it boring, and yet that is just what happened. The poor direction is undeniably a big part of it--for a show that seems to want to stand out, the fights and action sequences are pretty standard, no flair or finesse to keep the audience's interest. Even when the risk takes on a global scale the tension is nonexistent. Mnemosyne is at its best when it's being tongue-in-cheek, so why couldn't it just stick with that?\\n\\n\r\nStill, even with bland execution some shows can leave a positive impression if they put out a decent story. But nope, to call the story here mediocre would be generous. The entire first three episodes could be removed from the story altogether with only minimal rewriting and at virtually no detriment to the overarching story. The plot drags its feet through arc after inconsequential arc that often have little to do with the ridiculous mess that's eventually revealed to be the plot, and at the end of the day it seems to sincerely want the audience to take it seriously on some level. I couldn't help but think that this should have been a feature-length film if anything, maybe that would have given it some much-needed focus. We don't need to be repeatedly reminded that vodka means water in Russian without variation, thank you very much. Apos' final plan is absurd and pointless and half of his means have nothing to do with the end. Several twists are thrown in for no apparent reason except to make the plot more \"edgy\", and it gets really old really fast, especially when the straightforward direction gives every indication that this story really thinks it's actually going somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nMoreso than its poor plotting, this series falls flat in how it develops--and doesn't develop--its characters. For a centuries-old mystery woman, Rin is simpler and more transparent than she has any right to be. She's not unlikable, she has a respect for humanity and cares about the people who are close for her, but aside from getting angry every now and again she's pretty much static, with no hidden depths aside from a bit of backstory in the finale that doesn't really add anything to her character. Her partner Mimi actually gets more development, and that's not saying much. The side companions they pick up over the course of the series receive much the same treatment. Kouki, for instance, has an interesting backstory that the show conveniently tosses aside for most of his screentime only to pull it back to try to milk it for some last-minute drama. To make matters worse, they're not all that fun to watch. I know this is subjective, but if the show isn't going to make its characters complex and thoughtful the least it could do is make them energized. This show waffles incessantly between silly and serious, never sticking to one long enough to leave any kind of impression.\\n\\n\r\nI've nearly beaten this show to non-death, but I have to come back to the show's fanservice elements, because while I don't think the raunchy material is inherently bad, in execution it drops the show from bland and forgettable to just plain bad. I mentioned that the mythos somewhat justified the presence of fanservice in the show, and it does: the Angels are basically incubi, and while I won't spoil it, a certain pairing becomes part of a ritual that plays a key role in the series' conclusion. It's ridiculous, but with better execution I'd be willing to go with it. Rin using her sex appeal to get close to her targets on missions? That actually makes sense. Battles fought in minimal if any clothing? A bit much, but it happens. A security guard shoving Rin, the unknown and probably dangerous intruder, to the ground and trying to rape her on the spot without subduing her properly? This is getting stupid. Everyone in this show, be they human, Immortal or Angel, is ridiculously horny, to the point that it often gets in the way of their common sense. The series' oversexed nature extends well beyond what's justified by the tone and the mythos, it gets in the way of the story, and it becomes familiar so quickly that it ends up becoming just dull.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen plenty of series stand out positively for the amount of love and care that went into making them, but despite its unusual production history and somewhat interesting ideas Mnemosyne feels shockingly cold and apathetic. It baffles me that the makers of something so novel and daring could care so little for their baby, but that appears to be the case. It has no idea what kind of show it wants to be, the end result tries too hard to be edgy and not hard enough to be entertainingly over-the-top about it. It still has some funny moments and some cool moments, but they're not enough to be called a saving grace. The show had no right to turn out as bland as it did.",

            "content": "&ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo;, also known as &ldquo;Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumetachi&rdquo;, is a six episode series containing a mix of supernatural, science fiction and horror elements. What will no doubt strike most viewers about this series are its explicit horror and sexually tinted scenes. \r\nConsidering these horror and sex scenes, as well as the themes behind them, &ldquo;Menomosyne&rdquo; is only suitable for mature viewers. Those who do watch will be treated to a dark series that holds some very interesting references and concepts, both apparent from its visuals or integrated in its plot.\r\nThe series' time frame spans over sixty years, the first episode showing us events that occurin 1990 while the last episode takes place in 2055. Some flashbacks even give us a glimpse of events involving the main characters that took place many centuries ago. \\n\r\nThe story follows Rin and Mimi, the various people they encounters and the overarching plot around mysterious phenomenon involving Yggdrasil, everything is slowly unravelled piece by piece to come to a conclusion in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series, Rin and Mimi run a detective agency, as such the first episodes seem to be more independent mystery tales that reveal little about the girls' true nature and nearly nothing about the overarching plot. Gradually more pieces are added to the puzzle and the whole plot becomes clear during the final episode when its fully explained and the intention of those that were pulling the strings behind the shadows becomes clear. This can make the final revelations a bit of a paradoxical experience for the viewer. \\n\r\nOn one end, as everything is explained to the audience about the mystic nature of immortals, angels and Yggdrasil, it is rewarding to finally see the bigger picture of the series. On the other end since it was initially so vague that it seemed almost absent during the first episodes, most viewers who have developed a bond with the main heroines are more likely to focus on what becomes of them and may feel more alienated in regards of the overarching plot and its impact on humankind, even though it does involve the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAt first glance it may look like the horror and sexual scenes are there just as selling points to brand the series and fit it in the horror or sexually explicit category, an impression that could even be reinforced when one realizes the meaning behind most of this horror and lust towards the latter half of the series. Yet I found they end up giving the series more depth and add weight to its themes of (im)mortality and human desires. Not only do those scenes explicitly reference to psychological themes or hold sociological meaning, they also tell us more about the characters involved, which may cast a more grim light on some but makes them that much more interesting and involving characters. \\n\r\nMuch like the excessive horror and blood spilling in &ldquo;Elfen Lied&rdquo; served another purpose than just showing gore, which became clear as the series progressed and ultimately gave it a deeper meaning, especially for its characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is rather small, which makes it easier for us viewers, seeing the limited number of episodes. Most are quite interesting, even when little is known about their pasts, the way they're presented and act shows more intricate and complex characters than the average bland two dimensional characters. Some even offer us quite daring and grim persona. \\n\\n\r\nRin of course gets the most attention and development, while Mimi is an interesting character, she clearly remains a supporting character to Rin.\\n\r\nBeing immortal, Rin especially seems to almost seek out situations where she will encounter physical harm, her body often suffering atrocious injuries. While Mimi is more reserved towards dangerous situations, like Rin she too is no stranger in seeking out the extremes of physical pleasure, certainly sexual pleasures. In the end it's made apparent that being immortal can also be seen as a curse, cut off from one of the very foundations of what it means to be human, one's mortality and finity, the girls can often only thrive or feel alive by seeking out extreme physical experiences and emotions, be it through suffering or pleasure. Paradoxically, their hearts and spirits are shown to remain as those of every other person, while somewhat desensitised towards certain concepts that normal mortal humans face, they became perhaps even more sensitive to others. When they are finally able to bond with someone and feel true emotions such as love, any joyful or painful emotions there seem to be felt even more vivid than for mortal humans.\\n\r\nMore disturbing in that aspect, no doubt intentional, was the emotional torture executed on some of the characters, showing that physical pain while great and lethal, can still pale in comparison to mental anguish for which no true deliverance exists, especially when there is no deliverance to be found for it by death.\\n\\n\r\nPortrayed as a strong female lead, who is not only smart and cunning but has terrific martial art skills, Rin is voiced by Mamiko Noto, whose subdued and soft voice could be seen as ill fitting but actually offers a nice contrast and adds indispensable depth to Rin's character by making her not only appear more serene and experienced, but also gives her the aura of a soothing mother figure. This gives Rin a believable mix of strength and vulnerability, of passion and serenity, of distance and attachment.\\n\\n\r\nMimi's character seems a bit more standard but also turns out to be quite interesting. Mimi's bond to Rin seems to be quite deep and even amorous at the start of the series, but later on those amorous and lustful feelings seem to have given way to a deeper and different attachment. Ultimately Mimi fights to protect and save Rin, the way Rin had once fought to save her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile the bloody horror scenes should still be stomachable by most, the sadism exhibited in some scenes can be stomach churning. Some characters are repeatedly tortured and mutilated in such sadistic ways, it forms a dark and dire sketch of the inhumanity and levels of sadism some can display.  It may seem a gratification or even celebration of sadism, inflicting pain and sexual abuse. A theme that was also touched upon in &ldquo;Higurashi No Koro Ni&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nNext to the horror, there are many sexual themes and sexually tinted scenes, from near explicit sex scenes to the mutual effect immortals and angels have on each other. All immortals are women and the only real treat to their immortality are angels, males that posses superhuman strength offset by an extremely short lifespan. Devoid of any logical and normal reasoning, angels act as wild beasts that seek out immortals and devour them. Immortals are vulnerable to angels due to their overwhelming physical reaction to them, when close to one, they become utterly defenceless and lust to be embraced by them.\\n\r\nThe sexual references are quite obvious, men are referred to as mindless beasts whose power is to subjugate and conquer women, women who regardless of their own powers such as continuing the circle of life, become lustful creatures unable to resist men.\\n\\n\r\nIts story also expanding into the future, &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; shows us an interesting view of mankind's future with a contemporary spawned idea of how the digital world permeate and eventually blend in with the real world. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation by Xebec and Genco throughout all the episodes is good, with most focus on the female characters and the realistic, detailed backgrounds. The difference in care and attention of the animation between different scenes can be apparent sometimes. In some scenes where naked bodies are shown, they are not always drawn that well. Some of the horror scenes that would have been too gory and no longer look convincing enough if directly shown, use clever tricks of shading and suggestion. \\n\r\nOverall, the animation of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is good, though I did miss a bit of the beautiful animation of Rin and Mimi in the last episode, near the ending sequence, it didn't seem as well cared for as in prior episodes. On many occasions the animation of Rin and Mimi is quite sublime, such as the view of Rin leaning against a stone pillar in the opening sequence.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; is fairly good, the hard rock track accompanying the opening sequence immediately sets the trend for the more raunchy and hard hitting horror and sexual parts of the series. The remainder of the soundtrack does a good job at setting the mood and accompanying what happens on screen, though a more eerie soundtrack could have worked just as well but risked making the series a bit too dark.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend &ldquo;Mnemosyne&rdquo; to those who want to see an engaging story with an interesting lead character and aren't afraid of gore or sexually tinted scenes because regardless of those scenes, they emphasise some of the more interesting themes the series holds. And if you're watching it just for the horror and nudity, you'll no doubt be satisfied as well.",

            "content": "\u201cThe gift of life is a fleeting precious thing. It is not something to be toyed with.\" - Asogi Rin\r\nSex, violence & alcohol. These three things are some of the most prominent in Mnemosyne, and while it may not be as gory as say, Elfen Lied, this series isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. \r\nOriginally I went into this thinking it was mostly consisted of copious amounts of torture scenes, gore, and sex scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be so much more than that.\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\r\nMnemosyne follows the lives of two immortal private detectives, Asogi Rin and Mimi,as they take on various assignments. The series actually span several decades (around 60 years, or so), with each episode skipping quite a few years. Because of this, we see the world and the characters in it change as time goes on, while Rin and Mimi stay the same. \\n\r\nThe consulting agency at which the two main characters work at make for \u201cmonster of the week\u201d-type episodes, with seemingly unrelated events. However, as the story goes on, we see how it all fits together, and as we learn more about Apos\u2019 (the main antagonist) true motives, we uncover more answers about immortality and the \u201cnon-mortal world\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you will encounter so many unanswered questions that it may seem confusing or intimidating to continue watching, but as the episode goes on, the writers do a good job of explaining most things, however not without leaving you with more questions. \\n\r\nThis element of mystery and never really knowing what\u2019s really going on, or what\u2019s going to happen next will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe very first thing you\u2019ll see is the opening sequence, which to be honest isn\u2019t anything all that great. It\u2019s more or less your standard \u201ccharacter montage\u201d, with some pretty weird stuff and some fanservice thrown into the mix. \\n\r\nAlready in the first scene you\u2019ll see one of the characters wearing nothing but an unbuttoned shirt, while running across a rooftop. This sort of \u201cfanservice\u201d is present throughout the entire series, but because of the way it is done, it never feels as if it\u2019s forced, or takes away from what\u2019s actually happening. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019ll be a lot of times where the characters are naked, whether it be during a  fight scene or during one of the many sex scenes. Yes, there are actual sex scenes in Mnemosyne, something you don\u2019t see in a lot of anime (though here it\u2019s 90% lesbian sex). \\n\r\nOfcourse there are some scenes where the characters might be perverted just for the sake of being perverted, but most of the time it all fits in rather well with what\u2019s actually happening, and it doesn\u2019t take away from the experience at all.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the art, it\u2019s rather well done, actually. I liked the character designs (especially the choice of physically portraying Mimi as a teenager), and the changes made to the characters as the years passed were nice, as they\u2019d really show that the characters do age, but you were still able to tell who was who. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall aesthetics are also well done, and somewhat change throughout the episodes, but nothing really major (though I suppose architecture don\u2019t change that much in 60 years). However, once again you can see that this is a totally different time than the previous episode, and how civilization has advanced.   \\n\\n\r\nThe animations were fluid, and there was not a moment where I felt like it seemed \u201cstale\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nOne of the first things I noticed when I started watching (and it didn\u2019t take me very long) was Kugimiya Rie as the voice of Mimi. Having only heard her voice characters who are a lot more aggressive (and overall very tsundere), Mimi was quite a nice \u201cchange of pace\u201d so to speak. While she\u2019s not very aggressive, she has a more \u201cchildlike\u201d voice than Rin does, and this fits very well with her character design. \\n\r\nThe rest of the voice actors did an overall good job, and there wasn\u2019t really someone who stood out as \u201cthat character with the lame voice acting\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \u201cAlsatia\u201d, and the ending theme, \u201cCause Disarray\u201d, are both performed by Galneryus, and since they\u2019re both very much done in the same \u201cstyle\u201d, it makes them sound very similar. I can\u2019t say I really liked these songs at first, but near the end of the series I\u2019d gotten used to them, and I guess this is very much a preferential thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was often rather \u201ccalm\u201d, or had a very casual feel to it, which was quite the interesting contrast to the themes shown in the series. This didn\u2019t feel like a bad thing, though, and I quite enjoyed the music. One small problem I had with it, however, was that the background music pretty much stays the same for the majority of the series, and I feel like it would\u2019ve been nice if it had changed as the years passed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe characters are obviously a big part of this series. The two main characters (and their dog) stay the same throughout the series, as everyone else ages. This does not only apply to appearances, but there isn\u2019t really much development for most of the series regarding these two characters. Instead, the show focus more on the backstory, giving us flashbacks now and then, revealing small parts of their past. I thought this was interesting, since the immortals would\u2019ve probably lived for a very long time, and it could be fun to see their past experiences (unfortunately, not much is revealed about their past lives, aside from the parts important to the plot).\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode (more or less) introduces a couple new characters to the cast. These characters are usually pretty young when they\u2019re first introduced, meaning they stay around for a an episode or two. Because of the short amount of time these characters are given (as opposed to Mimi & Rin), it\u2019s important to make them as interesting as you can with the given time. \\n\r\nI felt like the writers did a good job with this, as there were times when I\u2019d certainly \u201cfeel\u201d for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are quite varying, and they\u2019re all rather likeable and interesting, and without this aspect I feel the show would\u2019ve been much worse.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Mnemosyne, and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be such a more interesting anime than just \u201ca bunch of sex and violence\u201d (even if those things are certainly present). Though once again, I\u2019d not recommend this show if you\u2019re susceptible to gore or overall nudity... \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Interesting storytelling \u201cmechanics\u201d (having the story span decades).\\n\r\n+ Several twists and events to keep you interested.\\n\r\n+ Good art and animation.\\n\r\n+ Makes use of fanservice, as opposed to just \u201chaving it there\u201d.\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack makes for a nice contrast to the visuals.\\n\r\n+ Interesting character cast.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Too many unanswered questions at once may leave you very confused.\\n\r\n- Opening and ending themes have a very specific \u201cstyle\u201d to them, may not be for everyone.\\n\r\n- Soundtrack doesn\u2019t change all too much with the time skips.\\n\r\n- The levels of violence and nudity may turn you away if you\u2019re not prepared.",

There aren't too many shows that I watch and actually have to say.....\"Wow, thats fucked up...\" Last one was either Berserk or Ninja Scroll.  This isn't a kids show by any means.\r\nStory:  I've only gotten one episode in, but there are allusions to a deeper running plot.  My expectation is for mostly episodic content until probably the 5th ep.  There will be more and more revealed until that point, but the 5th and 6th should be true story.  Thats fine and as long as the story iseventually fleshed out while still being entertaining, its all good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: what else would you expect from a show with this much gore and yuri but great art.  Its sexy, and I'm talking about more than the boobies. XP  It has a very dark feel and definitely needs to be watched full screen in a dark room.  The higher the quality the better.  Some good effects and tons of detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoy the sound of the actors, and putting such a cute voice on Mimi is hilarious when you realize she isn't as innocent as she seems.  The OP is also great, sadly I don't tend to pay too much attention to them.  Something other that cheery Jpop is always nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'm having a lot of fun with these guys.  We've got the two &quot;ladies&quot; who are obviously bi, a somewhat wimpy and confused guy, and enough alcohol to drown them all in.  It actually looks like some care was put into these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Hey, this is a blast.  Some good laughs )though I'm sure that some of the humor will be lost on the younger watchers (Seriously....if your mommy tucks you in at night...you really shouldn't be watching this...even if you are 30).  There is a certain something that can be said for the experience of curing a hangover with liberal drinking.  Theres gore, well-played nudity, dry humor, action, sexual innuendo, sadism and more.  What else could you want?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  If this continues to deliver it may very well be my favorite new show, and perhaps make it up there with some of my longtime favorites.  Only time will tell.",

            "content": "Violence, sex, and torture. That's what Mnemosyne is about. It favors style over substance, and shock value over both. For those of you seeking bloody fighting and lesbian sex scenes: rejoice! Mnemosyne: Daughters of Mnemosyne delivers both. For those seeking a well told story along with the fulfillment of these more primal desires: don't get your hopes up.\r\nThe protagonist of the story, Rin, runs a consulting agency with her partner (insert double entendre) Mimi. Rin is the cool and collected field agent, while Mimi is the playful flirtatious girl who helps out by being a computer hacker. Through the course of the series, there area number of other important characters they meet and work with that you won't be able to keep track of because after the second episode the show tends to skips years or decades between each. While it is somewhat interesting to see the progression of technology across decades, it serves little purpose except to allow certain characters to age and have children in a show with limited run time. Unfortunately, this means the viewers have little time to get attached to a character before they are killed off, so we can't empathize with Rin and Mimi's loss. Did I mention that Rin and Mimi are immortal? Well they are, and they don't age, so they will remain hot and young so we aren't grossed out when they have lots of lesbian sex (often with other immortal lesbians).\\n\\n\r\nThere is an overarching plot to the story, but it is presented only very gradually until the final episode suddenly springs the whole thing at us. In the meanwhile, Rin and Mimi, sometimes with the help of other people they know whom we can't remember if they have been introduced, solve puzzling cases that are obtuse even in their resolution. Not that the final outcome of the individual cases matter at all to the larger picture, since the tangential link between them tends to be the involvement of a particular family (genetic, not criminal), and that another immortal often appears in order to kill Rin for reasons that are never explained, although there are repeated mentions of someone named Apos who seems to be manipulating something and being cruel and sadistic about it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is very dark, probably to convey the omnipresent brooding and ominous atmosphere of the series. For an OVA from 2008, the animation and art is good but unspectacular. Voice acting is generally well done, and the opening and closing are appropriately gritty, if not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, while Mnemosyne is a reference to the mythological Greek river of memory, the impetus behind the story is Yggdrasil, which is the world tree from Norse mythology.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the relatively average score that I have given it; \u201cRin: Daughters of Mnemosyne\u201d (or \u201cMnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musumi-tachi\u201d) is ANYTHING but an average, run-of-the-mill anime. This is a disturbing, startling, adult-only watch complete with regular intervals of rape, torture, nudity, and symbolic themes that only people familiar with Greek Mythology would understand. However, DoM is advertised as far more than just a show that throws blood and sex around willy-nilly to pander to the audience; it claims that every torture scene, every rape scene, and every nudity scene serves an actual purpose. Supposedly, these themes are not contrived andserve as a legitimately vital element to the narrative. Now, whether that advertisement is true or not, that\u2019s another matter entirely. So: Is this tale of immortals and angels just a cheap, mindless, pandering piece of trash that\u2019s only good for shock value, or is it a well-written and well-thought out masterpiece that is drastically underrated? The truth, in my opinion, is somewhere in between.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Rin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for, *cough, \u201cwater\u201d, and a talent for attracting things that cause her tremendous amounts of pain and suffering. The series follows Rin over the course of sixty-five years as well as the nightmarish events that she gets herself involved in as she tries to discover the truth behind her own immortality. The mastermind behind her tortured existence is a being known as Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil (the tree of all life). Rin is no stranger to the realm of the dead, but if Apos has his way, her next visit could be her last.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that I have very mixed feelings about. When the show decides to focus on the lives of Rin and her partner Mimi and their work as private investigators trying to unravel the mystery of their own immortality, the show works very well as an adult supernatural-detective thriller. The unique presentation of the anime does wonders for its pacing as there are only six total episodes, each one twice as long as a normal episode. Every episode is followed by a large time skip; a plot element that also works in the show\u2019s favor. While the environment, the people, and the technology around our main characters change drastically, Rin and Mimi always stay the same. This is a very nice technique that puts the character\u2019s immortality in perspective; there is no denying that there is some very nice writing going on in this series. The show presents us with an intriguing mystery and slowly unravels it overtime, just like a good mystery anime should. These parts of the show are definitely where it shines the brightest.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, for every element that DoM does well, it also does an element wrong. Very wrong. In this case, I am referring to the way that this show handles its more mature themes. I\u2019m no prude who automatically looks down on any overtly sexual content in an anime, but some of DoM\u2019s  \u201cmature\u201d plot elements are just plain silly and childish. For example, without spoiling too much, consider how immortal women act whenever an angel is nearby; who thought that turning the immortals into horny sex-dolls with no willpower was a good idea? The whole \u201cbang-me then kill-me thing\u201d is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously; it doesn\u2019t serve the narrative and kills the tone of the show. There is simply no reason for this plot element to exist, and it is not the only thing out of place. Virtually everything in this show based around Yggdrasil (google it) is just poorly executed, overly complicated, and unnecessarily sexual. The fact that it\u2019s full of mythological allusions does nothing to change to the fact that it is poorly written and rushed at times; the backstory and actual function of some of the supernatural elements aren\u2019t explained very well and minor plotholes exist throughout. In the end, what we end up with is a very mixed package. Sometimes the plot works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. All in all, it\u2019s decent and certainly unique compared to what anime are normally about.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also a mixed bag. The protagonists, Rin and Mimi, are definitely the two best characters. Rin, particularly, is the complete package; she has legitimate/complex motivations, a distinct personality, and receives development. Mimi doesn\u2019t receive the same development that Rin does, but she is also multi-faceted. The viewers get a very good sense of the bond that these two have with each other and their chemistry is very apparent; the protagonists are definitely the highlight of the show. The antagonists on the other hand, are unimpressive to say the least. Apos has no motivations what so ever and the motives behind pretty much everything that he or his underlings do can be chalked up \u201cbecause I\u2019m evil! Mwhahahah!\u201d We are simply never given a substantial reason for anything he does, and when we are, it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. The side characters are an interesting case because we actually get to see them age throughout the series. Their relationships with Rin and Mimi are some of the strong points of the show because the audience gets to see these characters (who the girls have grown attached to) get older and older until they eventually die. This helps the burden of immortality hit home with the viewers. Despite the lack of any complex antagonistic force, the characters of DoM is where the anime strives the most.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne has some great ideas, but it loses sight of them because it is trying too hard to be mature. If it had dropped the whole idea of angels and the idea of adding in Apos as a horribly confused villain (as well as the copious sexual situations that go along with it), this could have been a damn good show. Unfortunately, it ends up coming across as too inconsistent and a bit incoherent. If you are in the mood for something drastically different from the norm, then I guess DoM isn\u2019t a bad watch. However, I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to recommend it nor would I suggest that you get your hopes up; it\u2019s simply a decent change-of-pace anime at best.",

            "content": "This is by far the most boring anime I have watched. I rarely finish a series if I find myself disliking it mid-way through the series. I\u2019m very disappointed since I really wanted to enjoy Mnemosyne that at first, I was very willing to ignore whatever flaws it had. It\u2019s too bad that the negative aspects vastly outweigh the positive ones.\r\nBefore I go into the details of why Mnemosyne didn\u2019t appeal to me very much, I\u2019d like to state the things that I did enjoy. The opening song is one of them. I enjoy it so much that I barely skipped it. I'd evengo far as to say that it was the most enjoyable thing in the anime. The visual aspect of the opening was mediocre and just plain boring. The other thing that I enjoyed, or at least tried to, is the main character, Rin. Rin seemed to be the protagonist that I was always looking for in anime, which is why I badly wanted Mnemosyne to be good. She was the perfect mix of cool and bad ass and I really did like her character design,  but eventually, she just failed to be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with this anime is the lack of development. Everything from the plot to the characters was left unexplained. They fail to show what the main characters motivations are. This isn\u2019t just exclusive to the main characters, it goes for every character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are just meh. The show barely has any entertaining fight choreography and opts for guns and explosions. The most interesting fight scene in Mnemosyne is in the first episode and gets worse as the shows progress. In fact, the previous sentence describes the entire anime perfectly as the animation and stories descend far below pathetic by the last episode. The soundtrack is completely lackluster and seems to have been pulled straight from stock soundtrack library. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it was mainly a waste of time. The only other thing I felt while watching this show aside from boredom was frustration.",

A few lifestyle changes and interfaces are introduced in later episodes, but it has been used way better inGits:Sac and they don't effect the flow of the story much.

            "content": "First off, I would like to say, that FUNamations description does not do this series the justice it deserves.\r\nStory 9/10 - Mnemosyne, is kind of like the movie \"The Shining\", absolutely god awful, but if you pay attention to it, and put a little thought and research into it, you will see that it is actually a misunderstood master piece. Just like in \"The Shining\" there are actually multiple stories being told simultaneously. It is telling the tale of Japan and it's struggles after the nuclear bombs had been dropped, the Greek mythological tale of Mnemosyne(goddess of memory and remembrance) and her children, and thestory of a detective(who becomes a daughter of Mnemosyne), trying to piece all of these elements together. What did not like about this series is that there was a huge plot hole, that threw me off. And I find it didn't attract as many viewers  because of the aggressive and what most would believe to be pointless sex scenes, which derails the story for the eyes of people not looking for its complex dimensions.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 -The art was pretty average for this type of anime for the first half, but what was really good about it was the animation. Very fluid like transition between frames, no \"Blur frames\" or \"Half frames\" . But once the Greek Mythology story comes more into play the, the art becomes more detailed and ominous. The mysterious looking skies with a transient look, like water colors of a sunset painting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 -The music was very well placed throughout the series, every song was well placed with the themes of the actions that were taking place throughout the series, the one thing that kind of was bothersome, is that some of the songs sounded like something that was used in a corny 80's film. The OP and ED were definitely suiting to the themes of emotional and physical torture, and the abuse part, but nothing really creative along the lines of being original. The voice actors actually did a very good job on the English Dub. The voices weren't annoying as they tend to be English dubs and they did a fair job of getting the feeling they were trying to convey to the audience, and they didn't use unnecessary formalities, using apostrophes for omission(\"It's\" instead of \"It is\").  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10 -Rin is really the only character that has a solid dynamic nature through out the OVA's. Though Koki Maeno and Mimi, do some changing themselves through out the series, Rin is the only characters whose change is consistent through out it, the others seem to just change dramatically half-way through, as a significant amount of time passes. First time I watched this, Rin's character got kind of annoying, she comes into the series like a total bad ass, and ends it with her tail between her legs, that part really got to me. But when I watched it a second time, third time etc, I saw that to complete the story they wanted to tell it was a necessary plot tool.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 -Not going to lie, the first time I watched  this anime, I was absolutely appalled by the amount of sexual content and lack of story content. It wasn't until that I heard from a friend that I should re-watch it after reading up a bit on Greek Mythology and the story of the goddess of Mnemosyne. After doing that, I find little wonders hidden through out it, that I didn't see before, and it happens each time I watch it. In the end it was because of this anime, that I began to develop an interest in it again I have been able to get quite a number of people to start watching it as well, I also happen to own a copy of this anime as well, I liked it so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.4/10 -Overall, this anime is definitely got something in it for everybody; action, orgies, mythology, Sci-fi, comedy and a little bit of romance in the end. I give a strong recommendation to check it out with an open-mind and attention to detail for full enjoyment.",

Or is it doing all of that to cover up terrible script writing, characters coming out of nowhere (or in this case bloody orifices), animation that takes a sharp nose-dive after the first episode, cacophonous sound track, and the use of graphic sexual and violent elements to keep us in the dark to the fact that after six episodes nothing's reallyhappened.\\n\\n\r\nYou follow Rin, an immortal woman, along her life.

            "content": "This is the first complete OVA anime I've seen and, without a doubt, one of the best animes out there. Just a first glance at this anime's early sequences and it's clear that this one is just not for anyone. Mnemosyne contains the whole package: nudity, profanity, strong language, strong sexual themes and intense violence. So discretion is advised, this anime is exclusively for mature audiences.\r\nWell that being said let's start with the story. Normally a anime this long would have been separated in 12 or 13 episodes, so why is this anime cut into  6 - 45 minute OVAS? The answer is simple:is easier and less confusing to manipulate and separate time in 6 parts that it is on 12 or 13. Almost every OVA occurs in a different time lapse, the space however remains normally the same happening the main events in Shinjuku, Nagoya and Kyoto. Sometimes the location is changed by the flow of the story but mainly everything starts up within this cities. The OVAs divide in 5 different time epochs:\\n\r\n1st OVA - 1990\\n\r\n2nd OVA - 1991\\n\r\n3rd OVA - 2011\\n\r\n4th OVA - 2025\\n\r\n5th and 6th OVA - 2055\\n\\n\r\nOVAs 1,2,3 and 4 consist in different arcs regarding story. The 5th and 6th set the conclusion and finish the anime. Each OVA alone is so impressive that you'll make haste to watch the next one. The story is manly about the life of a immortal being, Asogi Rin and her assistant Mimi. At first in seens that Rin is just a common private detective, but as the storyline develops and the main events unfold you will discover who she really is and why she is immortal. \\n\\n\r\n-THE NEXT THREE PARAGRAPHS CONTAIN SPOILERS REGARDING THE MAIN STORYLINE (+OVA 3)-\\n\\n\r\nBasically the story revolves around the nordic legend of the \"Yggdrasil\", tree of life. This legend says that this tree's roots mantain united the two worlds, the world of the mortals and the world of the immortals. And if a woman, only a woman takes one of the tree's fruit it will become immortal, while a man will become a monster and die in eternal agony. This legend is a bit changed here: the men become \"angels\" (monsters with red wings) and are forced to fornicate with the females which are, at the same time, inexplicably sexualy atracted to the males. After the male has satisfied his sexual desire he must kill the female in order to be able to continue his sorrowful existence by eating the Yggdrasil fruit inside the female.\\n\\n\r\nAsogi Rin does not remember when did she consume the Yggdrasil fruit, in fact every certain lapse of time she forget's her memories due to Eipos (the main antagonist) influence. Sometimes when you begin watching a OVA you will not understand what's going on but the event sequence is so well put that in no time you will be enjoying the continuation of the OVA even if you don't know what's going on. And in the end the connection between the confusing and the certainty will arrive sooner or later, but it does appear in such a natural way that you won't even notice it. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing to point out is that you will be seeing these fruits falling from the sky all the time during the anime as well as the Yggdrasil far away on the edge of the city. I think it's kind of cool because it get's you more attached to Rin knowing that you can see what she sees. So in the end the story is amazingly well put. The changes in the legend, the different time spaces and some flashback (inputted smartly in some of the OVAs) just make one of the best storylines come alive and deliver a ultimate experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, spaces and locations are terrific. All the anime occurs mainly in some specific cities and some time it diverts to some other locations in order to fulfill certain objectives in the story. It sounds anoying to be always located in the same city, but this is when the time dividing aspect does it's job. In the first two OVAs you won't notice anything different, having only passed one year between them, but in the third OVA you will witness the changes in the demographical, technological and style aspects. These changes are so well driven that you will be impressed on how things changed from just one OVA to another and wonder what else is going to change afterwards. Note that the last two OVAs (5th and 6th) do share the same timeline of events as well. This is undertandable, being this two final OVAs the ones that contain the main storyline and define the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMnemosyne art is also focused on the horror, gore, bloody and sexual aspects. The dark theme in this anime is mantained on all the episodes development and does make feel one really anxious about what is going to happen next. Gore and blood are evident in this anime. From the scandalous turns and events in the anime (wich include from body dismembering to genital-piercing tortures) to the ending song theme (Cause Dissaray), this anime will result a feast for those who love violence. In the sexual aspect this show contains just enough content to almost fall into the Hentai genre. Nudity, mid-detailed sex scenes and, from time to time, pedofile sex escenes will be a often ocurrence here.\\n\\n\r\nAltasia and Cause Disarray are just the best opening-ending combination I've listened to. Normally all animes Open with a really good and powerful song but then the ending just becomes a slow and weak song that has a cool-down role. Differently from other animes, Mnemosyne both, opening and ending, are strong an powerful songs (of course my criteria funtions by my musical preferences: metal, rock, etc.). These two songs manage to create a feeling of a never ending struggle, a neverending story, this matches perfectly the immortal theme. \\n\\n\r\nPassing now to the battle soundtracks I really can't get enough of the main battle theme. I mean is just so original and really does go in when it has to. The rest of the BMGs are overall good and do a well job adding more spice to the OVAs. Another thing is the  japaneese voice acting, I mean Rin's voice sounds sexy and clear no wonder why, she's interpreted by Noto Mamiko (Ichinose Kotomi in Clannad, Yuka in Elfen Lied, Hecate in Shakugan no Shana, Shihou Matsuri in sola and the popular Emma Ai in Jigoku Shoujo). So it all comes down to if the music plays good in conjuction with the anime, well it actually it does, and it does rock hard without the anime as well: perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of characters in this anime. I'm in love with Rin, she's just so sexy. She's drawn to attract the male audience: exotic hair colour, big eyes, beautiful face, huge breasts and perfect all around body. The other characters are given least importance but are well drawn as well. Mimi is gorgeous too. She target's the other part of the male audience which likes a more clasic teen look: a not too llamative hair colour, moderate breast size, small body, and a all around teen look. Now the personalities are exotic and different. Mimi has the naughty-teen personality and tends to practice lesbianisn sex in one or two episodes. Rin is a special case: her main personality is quiet, confident and seductive when the situation requires it. But at some specific moments her personalitie suffers changes due to memory loss. So you will see her one episode as a loving girlfriend, then (almost all the time) as a detective or as a sexual goddess.\\n\\n\r\nA mix between a unforgetable story, over the top artistic quality, impressive soundtrack and wonderful and appealing characters gives Mnemosyne a HUGE onjoyment factor that transforms it into a ''must see\" OVA-Anime. This anime will challenge your senses, unleash your hidden desires and replenish your most gory and bloody necessities. Now the only question you must ask yourself now  is: are you ready to start watching Mnemosyne-Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi?",

            "content": "These are elements in most things media that you as the viewer are attracted to or appalled to and in this case, there are many anime that is clearly not meant for everyone and it\u2019s not just the pointless fan service anime or the very, very nauseating hentai titles but more titles that are too risqu\u00e9 for TV but instead went into the OVA format and that is where Rin Daughters of Mnemosyne come to mind and when first hearing about it based on most reviews and just shootin\u2019 the shit with some people, some say it\u2019s either good, perverted, creepy, etc. but then again,I\u2019ve been reviewing anime for two years now and I have seen way worse material than what they describe and so I went inside an open mind and that\u2019s all I wrote.\\n\\n\r\nRin Asogi is an immortal private detective with a thirst for vodka and a talent for attracting things that go bump in the night. In a series of nightmarish vignettes spanning sixty-five years, Rin\u2019s lush body is sadistically pierced, blown up, and mulched to a bloody pulp. The fiend behind her tortured existence is Apos, an eternal being obsessed with sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, the tree of all life. While Rin struggles to unravel the secrets of her endless agony, Apos lurks in the shadows, eager to tear into her ripe body and devour the memories of her countless lives. Rin\u2019s no stranger to the realm of the dead, but her next visit could last forever.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the result was that the show was\u2026\u2026while it has very strong sexual and erotic themes and there is copious amounts of graphic violence in the show, I didn\u2019t really feel that creeped out by it because in actuality, those themes fit within the show without it being played for shock value. Like I said, I have seen much worse than this. Elfen Lied, I feel was creepy, pretentious, and only being played for shock value for most of the part and also it fits the context. It doesn\u2019t seem out of place or inappropriate that you wonder what the hell you just watch. The story does introduce immortals, which most people are familiar with if they saw Baccano! And believe me, Rin gets in most situations where any person would just up and die. However, while Rin is an immortal, I did felt like she was in real danger most of the storyline does go through 5 timelines from the 1990s to 2011 to the very near future of 2055 within the span of 6 45-minute episodes, the pacing was smooth as when an episode end, it feels more conclusive and episodic at least for the first 4 episodes and while it has that monster or bad guy of the week (actually, year) format, it never felt as tiring or easily bored. As of what I thought about the main plot, I was confused at some times but then again, like most shows, I get the idea just about a few episodes in and it is an interesting yet devious plot.\\n\\n\r\nI do like the duo of Rin Asogi and her assistant Mimi as likable characters although while everything around them change, from cities to people to technological advances, they actually don\u2019t considering that I always remember the line of when Rin wants some water and Mimi gives her Vodka and says, \u201cVodka is Russian for water\u201d and that is repeated for the first 4 episodes. The Maeno family are the most interesting characters as you see different variations of them from Koki to his son Teruki and to Teruki\u2019s daughter Mishio and it does show how well-connected they are to Rin and Mimi. Apos, the main antagonist of the show, isn\u2019t exactly as textbook \u201ctake over the world\u201d villain as I thought. He does it with sex and murder.\\n\\n\r\nXebec is in charge of the animation and while I had my gripes with them on a few titles that I either watched and/or reviewed, this is definitely a far cry from the usual material they often make. The art style and animation is fine with the setting within the in-universe changing from either a year or two to 10 to 50 years. The gore and violence factor is very high so this is definitely not recommended for those who have weak constitutions or not much of a gore/violence fan.\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, really love the opening theme and I also thought the ending song was decent but not exactly high on my list as the opening and ending are both sung by Galneryus and while I like it, I can\u2019t really say it fits to the show although some of the time, it does.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the English dub, the FUNimation dub leaves me not wholly satisfied as while Colleen Clinkenbeard was perfectly cast as Rin, I seriously can\u2019t picture Jamie Marchi as Mimi. I like Marchi as a voice actress and I appreciate her going for a role outside of how she\u2019s usually cast but she sounded kind of screechy in her role. Todd Haberkorn manages to give a decent performance as Apos and all around, the dub is\u2026.well, the FUNimation standard of dubs.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: In short, I really enjoyed watching this show. I like that while it does have those themes I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, it manages to fit with the context of the show and not feel out of place and if the show creeped you out, then the show did what it needed to do. I guess if you are a fan of shows like this, then this is made for you.",

            "content": "Well, we're nearing the end of yuri anime month and so far the only anime I've watched that was completely new to me was Yuru Yuri. So I'm taking a risk this week and watching Mnemosyne. Written by Onogi Hiroshi who also wrote several episodes of Rahxephon, that can't be a bad sign, and the anime adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist. Of course, he was also involved in the completely unimpressive Aquarion anime and there is a big difference between adapting the work of others decently and being able to write your own. It's from Xebec and Genco, both of whom have done some really goodand really bad work. So, I have no idea what to expect. Let's take a look and find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is actually really simple. The Nordic world tree, Yggdrasil, exists. It releases spores that make women immortal and men into short lived angels. The story follows two immortals, Mimi and Rin, as they fill their time solving mysteries for humans over several decades and eventually face the greatest mystery they're aware of, the truth behind Yggdrasil. To be fair, there are some interesting ideas here and that's where my praise for the story is going to end because the execution is horrendous. The first issue you encounter is that the mysteries aren't interesting. What makes a mystery interesting is going through the deductive process to find the solution, even if you're being walked through by Sherlock Holmes or Harry Dresden. The issue with Mnemosyne is that there's no reasoning. They present the mystery, they go to informants, and then they're told the solution. There's no intrigue and nothing compelling about it. Yes, this isn't technically a mystery anime, but the boring \"investigations\" take up a lot of time and they never do anything interesting with them. I'm not going to go into great detail about the second issue that comes up since, frankly, it's really gross. All you need to know is this simple phrase \"sexualised torture scenes.\" Another major issue is that it's just boring. There are long stretches where nothing important happens and the first four episodes are really repetitive, all following the same basic arc. When something does happen it's generally not something that you'll want to see. Just reread the previous issue for the details. Then there's the romance, or more appropriately, sex scenes as the characters are given very little in terms of actual emotional connections. Obviously, my problem isn't with the yuri. What I do have a problem with is that a lot of these scenes have dubious consent or even lack consent completely. Yeah, these are real issues but where an anime like Berserk treats sexual assault seriously, Mnemosyne just has it as a thing that happens and never deals with the repercussions and it certainly isn't respectful for how horrible it actually is. I'll end with some story problems that aren't thoroughly unpleasant. One is going to be another issue with the romance, and that's that the romance that thankfully does have consent isn't developed very well. To give an example, two characters meet in one episode and have roughly a half dozen shared scenes. In the next episode they're married for no adequately explained reason and that, sadly, is the best that Mnemosyne does with the issue of love. This is an anime that doesn't establish its universe's rules very well. The final episode adds several new ones that were never mentioned or even alluded to. The result is that they seem to come out of nowhere. It's not quite a deus ex moment, but it comes really close. There's a lot of really stilted dialogue for the sake of exposition. Then there's the ending. I don't want to spoil it, just in case there's someone who still wants to watch it, but the ending is awful. It's rushed, it doesn't make sense, and it's really really really stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't exactly helpful. Yeah, great characters couldn't exactly save Mnemosyne from its myriad story issues, but they could at least make it somewhat bearable. The problem is that the characters are roughly as well done as the story. Most of them barely have personalities. Yes, the anime is short, but that's not an excuse. The Read or Die OVA is short too and it manages to have developed characters. Mnemosyne doesn't bother. The only three characters that I can really talk about beyond a very short description are Rin, Mimi and Apos and even they don't have a whole lot to them. Mimi is... supportive of Rin and good at hacking. Rin is... kind of a blank slate. She has a vaguely tortured past that barely gets touched on. She's always shown as being ready to help people who need it, but other than that her personality kind of varies based on what Hiroshi needs her to do for that episode. Apos spends most of the series being vaguely evil. You don't learn anything about his motivations until the final episode and it's not worth the wait. He ends up just being a really cliche villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, for the most part. A lot of the backgrounds are pretty plain but the character designs are pretty well done. My biggest issue is the massive amount of fan-service. A lot of it is just used for gratuitous sex scenes, but there are also the sexualised torture scenes that I'm trying not to mention because I care about you more than this anime does. The action scenes are pretty lazy. They tend to last for short bursts and several end abruptly without any kind of satisfying conclusion. Still, the art is probably the best part of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move on to the voice acting. Now, I know for a fact that Kugimiya Rie, Ishida Akira and Noto Mamiko can not only act, but they can do it magnificently. I've heard each of them do it on multiple occasions. That being said, their performances in this aren't very good. Honestly, they don't even sound like they're trying. In fact, the only cast member who seems to be putting in any effort is Nazuka Kaori. That isn't to say that the acting is bad, it just seems like it's \"phoned in.\" The music is all rather underwhelming, sounding rather typical for a horror action series. Except for the themes, which involve heavy engrish and are kind of annoying. No, it's not funny engrish like Black Lagoon has. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor on this one has to be a 10/10. There are lesbian sex scenes. None of the women really develop an emotional connection and some of the scenes are just thrown in randomly, but you still can't get a whole lot more blatant than that without going into pornographic territory. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how is Mnemosyne overall? Well, it has some ideas that could've been interesting and the art is pretty well done but the story is an absolute mess, the characters have very little personality and there's just no substance. I also have to wonder just who the target audience is. People who watch anime for a good story certainly won't find it here. It's definitely not funny. The action scenes aren't very good so action fans are out. It's labeled as horror, but there's nothing remotely frightening in the entire series so horror fans will be uninterested. Yuri fans might enjoy some of the sex scenes but will likely be disappointed by how little you get of actual relationships and by the fact that het ultimately plays a bigger role. It's probably too tame for torture porn fans, even though some of those scenes do get pretty graphic. I guess that just leaves the easily impressed and people who can be fooled by the illusion of substance, maybe people who want to watch torture porn and have some room for denial. If you're in one of those groups you might enjoy Mnemosyne, as for me I'm giving it a 1.4/10. Ultimately, the few good ideas don't make up for the complete lack of anything redeemable in the actual story or from the characters. If you want to see immortality mixed with other supernatural, mythical and sci-fi elements in a show that deals with sexuality and is actually competently done, check out the first two seasons of Torchwood. They're much better than this. Actually, the bad seasons of Torchwood are still better than this. Now, I need to watch something decent after that. So next week I'll end yuri anime month with a look at Sasameki Koto.",

So the last episode will be early July, having that being said, we are half way through this ova series but the story is still unclear.\r\nRin and Mimi apparently are kinda like immortal, they don't age or die, they get have guts spilling out and they would heal. Lots of gore and sex in this anime, there is at least a couple minute where Rin or even Mimi have to please this lesbo forinfomation in the last 2 episode.\\n\\n\r\nSome character appears in one episode as main focus and then they disappear completely. Other than that we know there is a cruel kid, Eipos, who seems to be another immortal, who is after Rin and Mimi. \\n\\n\r\nThey sure took their time into drawing the background in some part of the anime, and the music is good. Overall it is a good serie to watch probably just for the gore and sex, hopefully the story will improve.",

            "content": "A particular quirk to Japanese visual novels (story-based PC games) is the addition to extended graphic sex scenes to an otherwise PG or non-pornographic route. The fact is, beyond story, reputation, publicity and reason: sex sells best. This is a concept the creators of Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne seem to have wholeheartedly embraced. \r\nAfter buying another anime DVD from Amazon, I kept getting emails recommending Mnemosyne to me, but after reading some reviews I decided it was best to watch on Netflix instead. At six episodes, decided it wouldn't take up too much of my life - plus, if I didn't like it, I couldjust turn it off and not worry about what to do with a DVD I didn't want to watch. Unlike most anime, instead of being comprised of 25 minute episodes, Mnemosyne has an expansive 45 minutes per episode, meaning there is enough time to create an entire fully fleshed-out world and establish various characters despite the short series length. \\n\\n\r\nRin, the titular character (in more ways than one), runs a private detective business in the Tokyo district of Shinjuku. She deals with various cases with the help of her assistant Mimi. Thing is, being Magnum P.I. aside - Rin's immortal, and when she's not tracking down lost cats, she's getting involved in more supernatural mysteries that seem to find her whether she's on or off the map. What is the darkness haunting Rin - and is it the same force behind her inability to die? \\n\\n\r\nFrom backgrounds to finishing touches, Mnemosyne's art isn't really anything to write home about. The character designs along the same lines with generic crazy hair colours, big eyes and, yes, large breasts - I get second-hand backache just looking at this series. Similarly adequate is the music, apart from the opening song, which I skipped every time because I just couldn't stand it, but that is my bias. \\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that Mnemosyne's best quality is the use of time throughout the series. Recurring characters dare to do what many cartoon characters never do - age. And do they age! There is no better illustration of Rin's immortality than to have generations sweep past her as she stays the same, and the implied loneliness this creates. And it isn't just people who age - society and technology sprints along at every new episode. From totally immersive MMORPGs to intuitive virtual-reality shopping at a fingertip, this is one of the most intriguing aspects of the show, especially how it relates to Rin's investigations. Though I have to say - Rin, if you only get one case every twenty years, maybe it's time to consider a career change? \\n\\n\r\nFrom the best to the worst: the explicit porn and gore scenes. I felt that, like a VN, Mnemosyne should have had an option to turn these scenes off altogether as they added nothing to the plot, feeling nothing more than embellishment to attract freaks and their wallets than any kind of artistic or political endevour. There were many times I considered like closing the browser window when these scenes happened, and they do colour my ultimate perception of the show negatively. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, I thought the voice actors did very well with the material they were given. Whereas the majority of the cast didn't last more than a few episodes, they fit their roles well enough. Colleen Clinkenbeard deserves a special mention for her consistently natural delivery as Rin, even during more... challenging scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series presents some compelling mysteries and the setting and time-span are utelised effectively to create a unique perception of human impermanence from the eyes of one who cannot age. The evolution of technology throughout was also fascinating to watch. The ending's reveal on the nature of Rin's mysterious condition also drew from several mythical sources, suggesting that the creators had done a lot of research on ancient civilizations and their beliefs. Without giving too much away, I also appreciated the subversive attitude towards what we consider angelic beings - it felt like the first time Mnemosyne had dared to make a statement that wasn't explicitly sexual in nature. However, I felt that as much as the erratic, brave plot was a cartographer's delight, the pornography and gore are enough to take this series off the map for me. While Mnemosyne has potential, it is preoccupied with selling itself, and selling itself too cheap at that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAmazon.co.uk price: \u00a36.75 \\n\r\nLanguage: English, Japanese \\n\r\nSubtitles: English \\n\r\nNumber of discs: 2 \\n\r\nClassification: 18 \\n\r\nStudio: Manga Home Entertainment (UK) Ltd \\n\r\nDVD Release Date: 13 Sep 2010\\n\\n\r\nOriginally posted on marusamarento.wordpress.com",

            "content": "My,my, this anime was hard to rate.  First let me start off by saying that the plot is incredibly original. The plot being that Rin, our busty lead characters, and Mimi, our negative busted lead characters, are immortal.  What does this mean?  To some people it means never having to fear death, to others it means having the fear of being eternally tortured.  \r\nMany years in the future, spores are released, constantly being breathed in and out,  every so often a Fruit of Immortality (special spore) is released, causing humans to become immortal.  If you are sick, you aresick forever, healthy, immortally healthy.  (Imagine if you were on your period? Eternally on your period)\\n\r\nFemales turn into immortals, males turn into demons that live only a few weeks and feed on immortals.  Immortals are turned on by males and cannot control them self in the presence of a male. AT ALL. If you JUST became an immortal and a male flies over head, then your shit out of luck. \\n\\n\r\nI comment on this the most because this was an aspect I found interesting.  The main plot is great, but there is an outrageous amount of fan service.  I understand that fan service is a staple, but There were at least two FULL ON sex scenes (including oral, vaginal, and so on) where the characters names were BARELY mentioned. Meaning they weren't even SUPPORTING characters. Honestly, if your going to put TONS of fanservice at least make it relative to the storyline.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNote: If you are an EroGuru fan, your will love the anime to bits.\\n",

I urge you not to drop this one though (even if you have a weak stomach) because it's totally worth it.\r\nMore importantly, don't get too caught up if you're raising an eyebrow at first. Admittedly it can be quite strange in places.But this is one of those anime you'll likely watch again, not because it's bad writing (hell no) but because there's so much you'll have missed that will beg you to re-watch it and say \"heh didn't notice that before!\". It has a charm to it that will instantly make you forgive the more odd aspects of it. Hard not to reveal spoilers but the last two episodes really do have your undivided attention. There's a few little holes here'n'there, but it's easily forgotten/forgiven. \\n\\n\r\nThere's mythology (predominantly Greek, with a few others), philosophies of rebirth and memory, and philosophically driven tones present throughout (those of us who are well versed in the more occult areas of European mythology will spot a few cool things too)... it's quite an intellectual bashing if you're not paying attention or perhaps don't know much about mythology/mysticism. However it's got a really good story built into a time frame that follows (mostly) Rin and her interactions over the decades this anime is set over. The way they tied in the different arcs throughout the series was fantastic (considering it's only six, ~45minute episodes) you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nSound/art: good all round (9/10) no complaints.  \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR- Watch this anime with an open-mind, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

            "content": "This anime has put a spell on me, a spell so powerful I'm woken up in the middle of the night two weeks after finishing this show and thinking about how god-awful it was. The only way I can get this off of my chest is by writing a review and sharing my opinions.\r\nThis will be my first review and I've decided that I might as well write it on my least favorite anime, therefor this will be very opinionated (like every other review isn't) and may contain many writing flaws as I have not yet figured out a solid structure that I should beusing for my review. So without further ado, let's talk about Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the story. Essentially the plot is driven by a new story every episode, as most of the episodes are a large time leap from the last. Say 1990 to 2011, making it very episodic.  I didn't particularly dislike this about the show, actually it was one of the very few things I did like, if not the only thing. I was genuinely interested to see how much time had passed each new episode that I started and what had changed around our (mostly) unchanging cast of characters. Other than that, what was actually happening each episode was mostly uninteresting and forgettable, which made sitting through FORTY-FIVE MINUTES each episode painfully boring and almost kept me from even completing the series several times. Luckily there are only six episodes, so it amounts to about a twelve episode series. I'll admit, the actual premise of the show isn't that bad, it's actually pretty interesting, it's just very poorly executed and could have been approached much better in my opinion. It does take until the later bits of the show to get into the actual plot, though, and honestly that just makes the previous episodes essentially useless because nothing of significance is really happening until later in the show. I also couldn't help but notice several plot holes throughout the entirety of the series, and you'll probably be left scratching your head once you notice them, too. There were parts of the story that were honestly so unnecessary and poorly executed that I found myself laughing at things I shouldn't be. At times, this show felt very similar to a poorly produced hentai.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I should include this with the story, but for this particular anime I think it should have it's own spot for discussion. Of course I'm talking about the excessive violence, gore, and sexual undertones of this show. Now normally I would have no problem with violence, sex, and mature content. Actually, it's one of the factors that I particularly love about anime when it is pulled off correctly. I think the first thing that comes to mind when people mention this anime is \"torture porn\", and it isn't too far off from the truth to be honest. I've heard several people say that the especially violent scenes in this anime are there for good reason, and help to advance to the plot. And yeah, I guess you'd be right, if the scene had tied and restrained the plot and put a gun to it's head. I thought it was very forced and unnecessary. It added absolutely nothing to the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe next point to make would be the characters. I would think that having lived hundreds of years would make you at least a slightly interesting person, I was wrong. Despite being immortal, there is absolutely nothing interesting about our main characters Rin and Mimi. I guess Rin can be pretty attractive in her pajamas though, that's about it. Every other character is very disposable and honestly they feel like they're just there for filler. Inevitably since each episode skips a fairly large amount of time, you know these characters aren't going to be around for long. Even knowing this, the show never really gave me a reason to care about any of these characters. The most interesting character in this show is without a doubt Apos, and without him there to drive the plot I probably would have dropped this show. I'll also go out to mention that some of the characters have very odd decision making.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where we come to, personally, one of the worst aspects of the show. The art and animation, as well as the sound. This show possibly has the ugliest color template I have ever seen in my life. There isn't a more polite way to put it. It's actually visually displeasing. The animation is pretty stale most of the time, and you'll never be thinking that a particular scene looked very nice, but honestly it isn't bad, it's just mediocre. The torture scenes are obviously where most of the hard work went in regards to the animation, and it's pretty sad that that's the case. It could have been put towards much better places rather than the scenes that are forced into my face and have no appeal whatsoever. The soundtrack is terrible. I actually partially feel that whoever composed the soundtrack of this show had ulterior motives, that being to troll every single viewer of the show. One song in particular really got me when it kicked on, it was almost infuriating but also made me want to laugh at the same time. I don't know what to feel. In a sense, this made the soundtrack very distinct and memorable, but not in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all,  Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi, has to be the worst show I have seen in all my years of watching anime so far. This is a generalized review, so I didn't go into the core details of the show, or else I would be sitting here writing for days, and no one would want to read all of that. I did try to include parts of the show that weren't particularly bad, but honestly they are very hard to find so mostly, I couldn't. There are probably a ton of structural mistakes and whatnot in here but this is the first time I have ever wrote a review, so go easy on me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict, should you watch this anime? \\n\r\nNo. You'll be asking yourself why you're still watching this each new episode.\\n\r\nI can't even throw in a witty excuse for you to watch this show.\\n\r\nJust don't.",

She is now in 1990's ( Might be 1980's i can't remember) She works with her partner at a PI firm. Solving day to day cases as a means to pass time with each other. The rest of the story at this point is about two episodes of Investigating and then just kind of turns into mindless drama with no real meaning to it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first 2 episodes are amazing ( In fact i was thinking after the 2nd episode that this is probably gonna be around a 9 rating if it keeps this up) The 3 episode is alright. But 4,5 & 6 are just so.. I guess weird is the only way to explain this. We no longer have any of the Investigation witch was an awesome part of the show. We are introduced to these more absurd plots that just takes you out of the show. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 3 Has a cast member now married with the women he help at the start of the show in episode 2. They have a kid. A bunch of a shit happens and it turns out that the evil villain they killed in episode 1 that made the said cast member into a clone. ( Oh yeah that happens. This cast member finds out he is actually a clone with the help of the MC and then they kill the chick who did it to him ) Is still alive and is now Immortal like the MC and her Partner !!! Yeah, This just ruins how special the Immortality actually seems. At the end the villain is trying to kill off the entire human population so she it will only be immortals and not men ( A grade A Feminist right here) Not only does this seem unoriginal it also just feels so eh i guess.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4 The start of the end of the show. Involves one of the cast members son being chased around in the 2020's where multiple sets of reality exist. The son is wanted by this AI that is a copy of a female teenager  that had a father that killed her just so he can make her an AI. The AI wants his D or something and wants to kill everyone else. I feel like this would have been interesting if they kept the AI alive and had the AI become a friend or lover to the son. It's also just messed up to leave it at some teenager dying from her dad to be used as a implement of science. ( I'll get into this later) Coming from the fact that it is November of 2017 as of writing this it's pretty funny how people from from 2008 saw what the future would be like. It can also kind of take you away the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 has an interesting idea but was poorly executed imo. It involves the MC having Amnesia and not sense of her past 1000 years of her life. But with rushed crap and an awful fight scene where the immortal dog of the show dies and the MC's partner is about to die. It was just very wasted. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 is the worst of them all and i do mean it.  MC abducted and is gonna be made into a bride and forced to give birth or something dumb like that. The US president ( Who looks scarily similar to Trump) Is in conversation with the stories main villain. It turns out the reason why the Villain that has been doing this awful shit is doing so is cause he likes eating the things that make people immortal.... So he has been doing all this awful shit cause he likes eating said things that makes one immortal. GREAT MOTIVATION !!!! Oh yeah this dude is also Half Man and Half Women. So he has tits and a dick. The entire episode is so fucking weird when i compare it to previous episodes. It honestly weird's me out and that rare sense i don't get uncomfortable easily. In the End the MC's partner is Rapped  by the shemale ( Oh yeah this is glossed over like no big deal. But i guess when you are immortal and pay for your information in lesbian sex i guess it isn't as big of a deal) The MC is now Pregnant with some guy that has had just about no screen time at all and is the first time we are really introduced to him. The Shemale is now dead and they forced him to eat his like fathers jizz i think and also the thing that makes people immortal. It also give you the memories of said person. So this chick he is constantly tormenting gives him her memories. Now the Villain is gonna be pregnant or something dumb.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is constantly saying these characters are Immortal. But they're not cause Immortal does mean not able to die and will live forever. So them being able to be killed, Even if by only angles makes them not immortal.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the entire idea of what makes these things that make people immortal is dumb. I in all honestly think the show would have been better if ti was only the MC and her partner and the dog that are immortal. Don't make this into a drama about people being able to be immortal as long as this one thing touches them. Just have it be that this set of three living being MC, Partner and Dog are cursed by some god they made mad once. Also don't have a fucking tree be the cause of all the problems in the story. Have it be so their are just set's of gods that do their own thing. \\n\\n\r\nI also feel if the entire show was focused on the PI stuff this would have been more interesting too see and not be them saving the world and them dealing with people who want immortality. In fact just have it be so no one knows besides select few.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also has these companies that are doing all this evil shit and for some reason is really powerful. It makes no sense why they Corps have so much power and are always evil. It's also a fucking cliche that i hate to death.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC them self tends to be really weak to the point it's fucking annoying.  She gets caught so easily and it's ridiculous. You would think a 1000 year old being would be able to fight off two body guards. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else is the fucking torture in this shit. At first it was pretty bad. In the first episode the villain had her tied to a chair and she would give the MC \" Piercings\" As she calls them. This involved shoving i believe a knife into the MC's tit and everywhere else. By the end of it she has piercings on her Vag, Ears, Eyelids and just about everywhere else you could think. \\n\\n\r\nIn the next torture scene. It's by the same Villain because now she has immortality. But she has the MC trapped ( She managed to get one goon to break into her house and grab her)  and tied down to an operating table. She has these surgeons literally open up her entire torso and start taking at all the organs. Kidney's, Lungs, Heart and Even fucking fat itself. All the while the MC is fully awake and aware. She still feels pain just as a normal human. But she is able to revive after she dies with all her organs again. \\n\\n\r\nThe Torture is needless and offers nothing. It's a waste of time and leaves a bad taste in anyone's mouth. \\n\\n\r\nLastly while i wrap this up. I feel this would have been more interesting if this was the MC and Partner going through pre existing time periods and staying on them more. Such as how awesome i think this would have been if we got to see the characters going through WW2 and experiencing things. Such as what if the MC was in America at the time of the start of the war or if the MC is at Hiroshima. \\n\\n\r\nI really wish this was focused around the MC back 1000 years ago. \\n\\n\r\nAn alright show with a awesome two first episodes but not much else. \\n\r\nRounding this to a 5 star rating.",

Enough to fool some people I would say.\\n\\n\r\nAlot of torture, if you like seeing pretty girls get shot, cut, slashed, stabbed, smashed, pierced, impaled, eatten, tied up etc then this anime is definitly worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nAlot of fan service. Alot of yuri/Lesbian action as well as normal sexual scenes.\\n\r\nOne of the woman who is like a information source requires her clients to pay in sex. As well as Mimi &amp; Rin's fooling around.\\n\\n\r\nAnime is kinda sad alot of the time, many characters get tortured for very little reason if not no reason at all. One of the girls get tortured her whole life by the Eternal angel/guardian just because he wants to experience the pain himself (you will understand after you finish the anime).\\n\\n\r\nI guess the anime which comes closest to this one is Kurozuka &amp; Maybe Elfen lied.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitly worth watching but whether you like it or not is a totally different story. =)\\n",

            "content": "For anyone who's ever seen Kite (A Kite) and enjoyed it, then Rin: Daughter of Mnemosyne is your next show. Rin is a detective/action show from 2007 so it has that Neon Genesis Evangelion original airing look because for some reason animation was the same for 20 years until we hit like 2009. Rin Asougi runs her own small business with her partner Mimi and dog Genta and help people along the way that get into trouble that evolves on a supernatural scale. The basis of the show is angels and immortals being born from the Yggdrasil tree passing off forbidden fruits that enter thebody. If it enters a woman they become immortal. If it enters a male they become angels and go out searching for immortals to have sex and kill them. Yes they have sex and kill them at the same time. There is nudity in the show but it's not solely for fan service, it also sets the mood for what's going on. A little more nudity than there needs to be though I will admit that. Lust plays a strong role in this show especially towards the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes place over many years, like 50+ and you can see the changes in the other characters which is a cool thing. It's not like they're getting into supernatural mysteries every day like other shows do and I respect that aspect of this show but you never have one solid supporting character. You get kinda attached during the miniarc and then they have to go because they're too old but you do keep up with their families which is awesome. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really great. Rin is such a badass. Mimi is the best partner she can have being a super tech geek and they have a dog! The dog doesn't solve mysteries with them, no, but he's there for moral support when they get back. The music is kinda funky because it's an older show. I mean 2007 doesn't seem that old but it kind of is. The OP and ED themes are GREAT though. The action is obviously the best part. Sure there are plot holes and things that they explain with crap but that's not often. The real focus is the action like I said. \\n\\n\r\nIt consists of 6-45 minute episodes but they keep your attention all the way through. I was never bored watching this show. \\n\\n\r\nRin: Daughter of Mnemosyne: 8/10 (Very Good)",

Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne does a wonderful job with the anime throughout the whole series. Each episode is set during a different year, so make sure to pay attention at the beginning of the episode to find out what year it is. There are some recurring themes and phrases in each episode, which show how even though Rin is with different people, she is still the same person after all those years. I was so interested in this anime that I watched the whole series in onesitting. That means a lot because I had never heard of the series before starting it. I simply saw it online one day and decided to watch it. I am glad I did because it was a unique anime with a fascinating storyline.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You enjoy mind-bending stories that travel into the future as well as the past\u2026Or if you like vodka.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You are looking for a light-hearted anime with a lot of feel-good moments.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Pay attention to the year at the beginning of each episode.",

I'm tired of all the clich\u00e9, angry-teacher-dumb-schoolgirl anime shows, or any anime that's all upbeat and cute, and simply drop dead corny. This show was screaming out my name. A unique, epic female lead who knows karate and other awesome fighting moves - just what I needed. I enjoyed the show'sbrutality, the characters, and the story, and the art. And personally, I never felt such connection to an anime character before. The lead, Rin Asogi, reminds me a lot of myself: bit of a tomboy, whimsical, very independent, and also hates running! The last part was for laughs. There's just a lot of things about Rin that remind me of myself.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode has its own story, but all have a connection, which fills up the puzzle of the big picture, which is really enjoyable. Each episode pushes the content limits, which makes the show take you to the edge of your seat. Unlike more anime that has episodes lasting almost 30 minutes, Mnemosyne has each episode lasting 45 minutes, or an hour if you count commercials, which is more exciting; however, there are only 6 episodes, which is disappointing, but splitting each episode in half makes it up for it, giving it 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own personality and story, totally different, each one. The show sometimes has its funny moments, sad moments, intense moments, anything you can think of. Looking at all the little details, this show has everything. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "I always find ratings for entertainment subjective. In one country it could be suitable for all, in another there is an age limit then something comes along that everyone can agree on. Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi is one of those. It really is adults only and I don't mean subject matter, I mean gratuitous violence, torture, nudity and lesbian sex. If you have a low tolerance for such things I would imagine Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi would not be your thing. \r\nGetting on to the plot I have to say Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi has one of the most confusing story lines since I sawKurozuka and in many ways, without going into detail, they are very similar. The story follows Rin an immortal woman from the 1990's to the middle of the 21st century with her equally immortal side kick Mimi as they run an investigation agency where they do anything from looking for lost pets, missing persons to breaking into top secret laboratories meeting various bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode is entertaining in its own right, however, the main weakness of the anime is its central storyline where we have a tree called Yggdrasil whose fruit can enter a person making women immortal and men into Angels who eat immortal women who are quiet happy about it and are even turned on by the prospect. All the while the main bad guy, Apos, is aiming to sacrifice Rin to the Yggdrasil tree. The main problem with this plot is that I found Apos as a bad guy and character just annoying. He doesn't do much apart from trying to be sinister which is done very badly.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately most of the characters are very good and well thought out. Rin as a central character is extremely likable and we don't find out much about her until the end a fact which I liked. Mimi is a lively side kick and a computer genius. Elsewhere we have an information broker who demands lesbian sex as payment, various members of the Maeno family who help Rin and an assassin who tries to kill Rin in each episode all of whom add something to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is good yet nothing special and there is the metal soundtrack which actually fits the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you have seen Kurozuka I would think you would like Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi as I would class them in their own sub-genre. They are both horror anime's yet scaring you is not what they are about.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Firstly: RIN is not torture porn. It's not simply in existence to be grotesque or controversial. We've all seen much worse, even when we were not expecting it. (I'm looking at you, Mirai Nikki).\r\nI'm not sure if it's the fact that many reviewers on MAL are more used to mainstream anime, or if they are just simply younger, but so many reviews here seem to be based on a very shallow interpretation of an otherwise deep, dark, genre hopping anime that cannot be described in any way but EPIC.\r\nI love OVA's and anime that tend to be on the shorter side of things. When itworks, the 13 episode format can tell a great story without adding the filler that we've come to expect from shonen and \"slice of life\" anime in the past few years. This series is basically in the 13 episode format, as it is 6 episodes that are 40 minutes or more each. \\n\\n\r\nI seem to be in the minority in liking the more short-form series, as I like stories to be concise and as brief as they need to be. Maybe that's the writer in me- someone who can spot fluff when I have to endure it- and knows that fluff is just that- worthless.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, yes, this work is one that requires some thinking. There are time jumps and intertwining stories from episode to episode that end up telling a sophisticated and intricate story, and that is something that is actually masterfully done here, which is rare in the anime world.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations and the sound here are amazing, especially given how many years ago this was produced. It is on par with anime film of the current year, and that's pretty impressive given that they kept up the quality for 6 40+ minute OVA.  The only other anime that I can recall that did that as well was Broken Blade. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some graphic scenes here, and there are plenty of sexual scenes as well, but they are done in such a way that only adds to the mood and the atmosphere of the overarching story, so I don't think they are exploitative or too over the top.\\n\\n\r\nBE WARNED, however, that it would be advisable to only watch this alone, as it sometimes can border on Hentai, and the scenes that do involve BDSM, torture and sex can get quite intense and uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like darker, more psychological anime that is geared towards adults- especially stuff like Psycho Pass, Ghost in The Shell, Elfen Lied, Darker than Black, and ESPECIALLY Berserk (mostly for its darker form of Violence) then you will definitely appreciate RIN. The only series that I can truly say matches the grandeur of RIN is probably Kara No Kyoukai (Garden Of Sinners), which also was released as 7 40+ OVA Films. \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, you will leave with an appreciation for this series' complexity and the masterfully done dark and foreboding atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nI became quite attached to the characters, and as you will see, there is often a lineage of family related to past characters that carries on, so in a sense, you get to know an entire multi-generational family over the course of this short series. I found this to be one of the most interesting parts of this series, as you don't normally get to see such a wide time frame played out in such as casual, fluid way. I can't say much more without ruining one of the best aspects of the show, so I will leave it at that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "At first I refused to write anything about this anime because of my lack of enjoyment of this particular show. The premise of the show was promising, an immortal PI who investigates abnormal activities. That sounded like hours of fun to me but what I got was torture porn and a story that didn't even develop until halfway through the series. What most of you are probably wondering is \"well if you disliked it so much why did you keep watching?\" And that is a good question.\r\nThe best part of this show was the first 3 episodes that had little to nothing to do withthe plot. Literally the first three episodes could be cut out and with a few flashbacks for context there would be nothing that lacked explanation. Character development is almost non existent but it is not a problem considering that the main character is immortal so she probably would not change much in the 60 years in which the show takes place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was solid and the parts that they wanted to stress the importance of were spectacularly beautifully animated. Unfortunately those were also mostly scenes with torture porn.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting and music were decent and it is dubbed, a good dub. The characters who are mortal do have some development but the characters who are immortal are pretty stagnant but it fits.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story did not take so long to develop anime it then it turned really weird this anime would have been good but no. Though I did not enjoy it I am fully aware that it may just be me so go on and watch it but you have been warned do not watch this show in the living room for all to see or with children it is most definitely not suitable for anyone under 18 and even then take caution because it is graphic.",

Mnemosyne has a very interesting story that has some cool elements of time switches involved between each episode. The story sometimes has it's trouble, but the characters are all very likable and help pick up any dull moments. The two main characters are just wonderful. You'll love their dynamic and hope that their story ends in a promising way. Now, this show is quite graphic. Some scenes will have you cringing, they really push the boundaries. Blood, violence, language, nudity, and sex areall present and common. The sex and nudity might at first seem like a play to get people watching, but it actually fits in well with the shows other graphic content and in no way feels excessive. My only faults with the show was it's art at times. Some of the scenes looked better then others and overall it looked fine, I just wish it popped a little more. Other then that, I greatly enjoyed this show. I watched it all in one sitting and finished it wanting more. If you enjoy dark animes with violence, blood, sex, and nudity while still maintaining an interesting story, then this is for you. If those types of things aren't your cup of tea, I would still suggest giving this anime a try for it is truly unique. \\n\\n\r\nContent Rating - 17+ Graphic Nudity, Sexual Content, Blood & Gore, Torture, Language, Alcohol Use",

            "content": "This six part OVA series was part of the 10th anniversary celebration for the AT-X channel a few years back. Knowing it aired on AT-X, it should have been pretty obvious that this show would be loaded with fanservice, but oh my, there was a lot more fanservice oriented scenes than I had expected. At the same time, though, the contents to this OVA series are sometimes extremely disturbing. Warning for anybody that watches this series, Mnemosyne is definitely for older audiences only.\r\nSurprisingly, though, the fanservice doesn\u2019t completely detract from the original concept for this particular anime. If anything, it only added to the surprisinglyunique premises and ideas explored in this series. Mnemosyne explores some very dark, and sometimes even brutal and cruel, ideas about how human society evolves and grows, all from the perspective of an immortal being.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the strongest points to this series is most definitely the representations of norse mythology, and more importantly, how it is incorporated into the actual setting. Represented by the fabled Yggdrasil tree and the immortal beings that result from it, the incorporation of norse mythology to the story gives this show a very unique flair in terms of both direction and concepts. It is especially obvious to see when you contrast the unrealistic idea of immortals with the present day society they are immersed in. Seeing our main characters, as they are immortal, witness decades of evolution of human society and technology, really does help give Mnemosyne a very unique atmosphere. The delicate balance of mixing the supernatural with futuristic technology really helps create a dynamic setting that really makes you ponder about every aspect in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the immortals themselves largely remain unchanged, which provides a huge contrast to the ever changing setting, where the settings of each episode often being decades apart from each other in terms of timeline. Yet at the same time, our main protagonists are aware of the fleeting and fragile lives of regular people, and treat that with both respect and dignity. The main characters themselves are more subtle at times, and were surprisngly well thought out in terms of personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe major issue with this show would include both the unnecessary fanservice (although at times it was essential), and the somewhat convoluted, odd plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is most certainly fanservice heavy, with a lot of lesbian sex scenes involving our main protagonists Rin and Mimi. As I mentioned earlier, this show is extremely fanservice heavy, with boobs and naked girls making a lot of appearances after the first episode. I will admit that I was completely taken by surprise by the heavy amounts of fanservice, as the first episode was extremely deceiving with it\u2019s notable lack of fanservice. And seriously, at least half of the fanservice scenes in this show could have been cut out with no impact on the main story. On the other hand, though, the fanservice was never blatantly stupid, and in numerous cases, did involve the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the line, in a nutshell, goes along the lines of \u201cimmortal girls who received the seed of immortality from the Yggdrasil tree is in a decades long struggle with angels and Apos\u201d. The plot does sound odd, but at times it\u2019s very well done. The story during the first one or two episodes really do help flesh out our main cast, but from there on out the story gets progressively more and more complex and convoluted. The story is actually pretty enjoyable to watch, but by the end of the OVA series most people will be like \u201clol\u2026what just happened\u2026?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series definitely isn\u2019t for everybody. Mnemosyne is pretty much a horror anime with a lot of fanservice elements. This show is similar to other horror titles like Higurashi no Naku koro ni, Elfen lied, and horror-torture movies such as Saw and Hills have Eyes. If you can\u2019t handle brutal scenes, this show is definitely one you should avoid. If you do watch this show, the story is rather decent, and the characters are well portrayed and developed.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Quality: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory/Setting: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.2/10 (Rounded down to a 8 on MAL)\\n\\n\r\nComments, feedback, and most importantly criticisms, are always welcome :)",

            "content": "Mnemosyne, or Rin: Daughters of the thing i just said but don't feel like typing again, is really hard to describe and review. It's a show that I could imagine has the most narrow fanbase ever because it's so off the wall and darker than a lot of shows. This is true not only in terms of plot, story, characters and all that stuff, but Mnemosyne really pushes the audiences buttons, and I really like disturbing shows, but Mnemosyne really takes the cake in terms of being a short show with great plot, average characters, and solid story while trumping other shows like Elfen Liedin terms of its explicit sexual and violent torture content. But when you look past all the explicit stuff you'll find a great plot that combines science fiction, supernatural, virtual reality, religious, detective, and psychological storytelling elements. So first the art, it's pretty run of the mill in terms of being good for anime, but it's still noteworthy because it brings all the super disturbing bits to life so well. The characters fit their plot well too, and the concept of immortality is portrayed in such a realistic light. Mnemosyne gave me a sense of surreal concepts mixed with realism and pulled it off so well. For example when immortals like Rin die (and the death/torture scenes are really hard to watch trust me) or come back to life, it's interesting to see where they end up and how their bodies get put back together, the example in question being when Rin takes a very long time to come back to life after falling through a jet turbine. And the immortality idea feels real because while Rin and Mimi never change, people around them die frequently because the anime takes place over such a long span of time. Granted Rin and Mimi are good characters, but static as they are immortal and never change. But the way the world and the people who inhabit it change constantly, letting each of the six 45 minute episodes explore the aforementioned genre blend. The issues I had with the show were all based on the fact that the plot can be very hard to follow, the characters like Apos take a long time to explain their ulterior villainous motives, and there was only so many times I could hear Mimi say that stupid vodka like before wanting to bang my head against a wall. The ending was a lot more underwhelming and I wanted it to have an overall..point I guess. But Mnemosyne hits all the other aspects in terms of creating a brilliant and surreal atmosphere with a lot of jarring sex and violence that do a great job of digging themselves into your brain providing a fantastically memorable, well written and highly jarring show.",

These are the only words that come to mind after finishing Mnemosyne. The first 3 episodes were fantastic, because it highlighted the show's greatest strengths; Self-contained, episodic mysteries with a gritty tone and supernatural elements sprinkled on top. If the show had kept this format for the entire series, it would be a strong 8/10 for me.\r\nEpisodes 4-6 are where the story goes downhill, as the creators felt it necessary to needlessly shove sci-fi elements and trite, boring lore into the show. From there, the storybumbles and fumbles until it falls flat on its face with a predictable, unsatisfying ending. \\n\\n\r\nIt's such a shame, because, as mentioned before, the first few episodes showed promise with a killer concept and setting, as well as some fantastic characters. Instead it abandoned its roots, and the result is a slightly above average anime.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Have you ever seen a show that had a fantastic first episode, followed lesser episodes and spirals downward into mediocrity? Well, this show pulls it off, and that being said it's fairly disappointing. Imagine a firework display but backwards, an awesome display of amazement slowly going down to a pitiful glimmer of entertainment here and there.\r\nSide note; This is a mature show, you will see naked women and you will see sex. You will also see blood and gore, which is fun.\r\nStory:\r\nOverall there was no REAL story, it was just episodic lore telling. Each episode takes place further into the future, and with each episodethey share more about how their world works, and develop side characters. With each episode going into the future, it felt like at times that I was watching a different show. At no point at all was I excited to see how the future would be portrayed as, because I was more invested in the first episode to care about the other ones. The real entertaining parts of this show was how violent it could be at times, which could beautifully get dark at times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are great! The immortals were explained well, as well as they were entertaining characters, and each side character was fun also. To contradict what I said about hating how the show goes further into the future, I actually really enjoyed how each side character aged. Each character held the show well together, and saying how each episode got a little less entertaining, the characters managed to stay the same fun group. There isn't much else to say on this matter, they didn't give me enough reason to keep praising, nor did they give me an excuse to really hate them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nSo the art is kinda the same as any early 2000 show, it has the old look that many peoples old favorites has. It did however have some pretty nice stage and set designs, which made each scene entertaining to watch. So as far as that goes, the music is what really made the art quite interesting. So to play off the whole 'each episode is further into the future' thing, the music for each episode does slightly change to match the time it takes place in. As I stated earlier, the first episode was the best, sound and all, but the songs in the later episodes was pretty nice as well. Overall, it was a fun discovery when I noticed it, then it really stood out when I payed attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was a fun experience, but I was pretty disappointed when the show progressively got worse. It's a show I was glad I saw, but it wasn't anything I'd really want to watch again soon.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested, and you've read this review and other reviews, and you don't want to waste too much of your time, I'd say watch the first episode as a movie and just forget about the other ones. It's episodic so you wouldn't really be missing out.",

            "content": "I honestly don't remember what exactly inspired me to check out Mnemosyne - it could be that I saw a fair number of people talk about how underrated it was, it could be the fact that it's so short (only 6 episodes), or it could be some other reason that I can't think of.  But regardless, I'm glad that I checked it out, since it ended up being one of my all time favorite series.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nWith 6 episodes, I actually kind of expected the story to be, at best, average.  Much to my surprise, the story is actually very deep and in-depth- and I actually found myself wondering about the moral ramifications of immortality (should it become a possibility within my lifetime, anyway).  While the torture scenes were a bit uncomfortable to watch at first, I realized why they were put there - to truly demonstrate Rin's immortality.   And while I knew Rin would come back from most of her deaths, there were 2 scenes where I honestly thought she was killed off for good.  Fortunately, she comes back - and in the case of the second scene, she actually come back better than she was when she left this world.  The only things I didn't like were the time skips in between the first 5 episodes - that was kind of confusing - and the fact that the first time we see Rin, she dies within the first few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nWhile Xebec isn't the best studio, they certainly aren't the worst - and this is a HUGE improvement over another anime they made that I had the misfortune of watching, Pilot Candidate.  The colors fit the mood perfectly.  It's only when I compare the art for Mnemosyne to the works of a studio like ufotable or Whitefox that it feels a bit lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nIt's pretty hard to screw up the sound - both the mixing and the score - for an anime (especially recently) - even some anime I've hated had an at least decent soundtrack.  I was expecting the OST to be good, but I was not expecting it to be this amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nI became attached to the main characters pretty quickly - especially Rin.  She's the ultimate anti-hero - she's nice, but won't hesitate to end a bad guy's existence in a wicked way.  Mimi was really cute, and I found her to be really amusing (when there weren't any action scenes, anyway).  The Maeno family as a whole was also a great group of characters - and I honestly wish the first one had stayed with us the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI watched the dub, and I'd say that I actually got the best experience possible.  The fight scenes were EPIC, the battles were very intense, and the plot twists were really surprising - especially the one at the end of episode 5.  THAT was a really shocking one.  The ending was perfect.  So, if you can't already tell...I had a great time watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nRIYL: Canaan, Claymore, Kara no Kyoukai, Baccano!",

            "content": "Mnemosyne...twisted, bizarre, and graphic are good words to describe this set of OVAs.  Despite that, this anime is both original and interesting, and almost instantaneously gripping.\r\nThe anime is extremely graphic, from torture, rape, cannibalism, with copious nudity and explicit sexual scenes.  These scenes are well done by most anime standards, however, there are so many of these elements and themes that the plot is pretty obscured, leaving me wondering what the purpose of the anime was: to stuff every type of fanservice into 6 OVAs, or actually have a simple plot with a lot of graphic detail.  It's pretty clear that untilthe last episode, the plot had already taken a backseat, as the first five episodes appeared to be more vignettes than a coherent timeline.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, I would say they're amazing. Multi-faceted personalities, well designed, with pretty coherent animation made this anime more palatable to people not so used to graphic violence. Asogi Rin seems to be the typical tough woman protagonist, but throughout the series she slips away from the stereotype and becomes all her own character.\\n\\n\r\nIn Short:\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Sound effects were amazing\\n\r\n- Good use of blood, not too much, but not censored either\\n\r\n- Character design was great\\n\r\n- Recurring themes seemed pretty constant\\n\r\n- sense of time throughout the series\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Weak plot overridden with fanservice and gore\\n\r\n- Plotholes that seemed to be solved incompletely or too quickly\\n\r\n- Animation in the last episode seemed not as clear",

So let this be a warning to any like minded people, this anime strays from the mystery/supernatural theme that it first introduces itself with.\r\nThis is the main reason I didn't quite like this show. I made the exception for immortality, as, in the past, it hasnever really ruined an anime for me, but it goes much further than a show like, say, Baccano. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first four episodes, Mnemosyne presents itself as a detective anime with some supernatural elements. This, as I said, is not something that would have turned me off. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. During these first few episodes, the show establishes itself as a detective anime quite firmly (and a good one at that). Then in episode five and six, it throws that out the window. This is my main problem with the show. It leads the viewer to believe that it is something that it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I really have to say about it.

            "content": "Okay, so this is my first time reviewing an anime...so no judging too harshly! \r\nMnemosyne or Rin in english was a fantastic series. Although short, it was in my opinion the perfect length for an anime that has longer episodes and carries such a complex and detailed plot. Still for the plot being as drawn out as it was, the only real character development seen was in the main heroine of the tale. The backstories were not explored much, which offered an interesting juxtaposition to the situation that the characters find themselves in, which was the aim of the writers hopefully. The main story lineis an interesting idea that was blown into it's full potential by the last episode. The series catches and keeps your attention throughout every episode. There were times that I had to take a second and figure out was going on when going from one episode to the other, but I thought it a challenge in making sure I can keep up. The story twisted nicely and sufficient amounts of both triumphs and tragedies to keep you laughing and crying and cheering the main characters on. \\n\r\nCertainly a darker subject anime, this one is not for the faint of heart. Full of blood, sex and violence I would certainly say restricted audiences on this one. That being said I thought that the art was some of the better that I had seen. The attention to detail drawn into this anime, variety of scenery and artistry was beautiful. In my humble opinion. The art is curved, stylish and robust. Nothing angular or unrealistic. Now here is where my naivete as an anime watcher will show. I do not know much about anime style, but my opinion of the art in this one is high. It's cinematic quality is also impressive for an anime. Altogether a visually stimulating and stunning work. \\n\r\nThe music actually did not really capture my attention. The opening and closing themes were heavier rock which is suitable to the anime, but nothing to be that interested in. There only being a small number of episodes the themes don't change so no variety to speak of, but the score works well enough. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime and would recommend it to anyone with a taste for dark struggle, violence and the underbelly of human existence. This gets a thumbs up from this humble anime viewer!",

            "content": "Despite what many people say about this anime, I actually enjoyed it A LOT. Each story was interesting, and the way the story unfolded was unique because each episode had a time lapse of about 30+ years. Viewers are shown how the world changes around the protagonists, while they themselves don't change. \r\nPeople complain about fan service in the series, but I honestly disagree. Fan service, imo, is when random panties and tits come out of nowhere, they're on the screen, and it contributes nothing to the plot or character development. What Mnemosyne has are sex scenes. Now, do they contribute to the plot, orcharacter development? I would argue yes. Either way, it feels much more mature than girl shrieking, and guy being all red-faced and apologizing profusely cringe-worthy fan service that is more prevalent in anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is generally on an episode-per-episode basis. While there is an overarching plot, it is minimally addressed. Each new episode has a new conflict, and the protagonists tackle it, and solve it by the end. It was very quite entertaining to watch. In fact, I liked it so much, I would give it a rating of 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThings took a weird turn after episode 4. The show goes downhill unbelievably fast from there. The formerly overarching plot? This is when they address it, and it's not all that great. In addition, the delivery is a downright mess. The number of sex scenes in the series skyrockets after episode 4. But even then, episode 5 was ok I guess. Episode 6 was a disgusting, unbelievable, convoluted fucking mess. People with backstories are introduced that have significant meaning to the plot, and are killed seconds later, sex and rape galore, the lore of ygdrassil that was teased throughout the whole series, is \"explained\" in literally 10 minutes, there is disturbing son eating his dad's semen imagery, just... holy crap. They go through everything SO fast, although I was able to follow it, I felt no attachment to anything, because buildup was non-existant. Nothing is explained fully. The dialogue at the end of the series also made me cringe really hard. Their idea of a \"wrap up\" is a joke. \\n\r\nSeriously, the last two episodes are terrible. I wouldn't recommend not watching these, but these two episodes will probably leave anyone that liked the first 4 episodes seriously disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, since I really liked the first 4 episodes, I would still give this anime a 8/10. The stories are very interesting, and unless you  have something against gore or sex, I see no reason why anyone should shy away from it. Just am very disappointed with the last two, and especially last episode.",

            "content": "So basically, this anime is more than meets the eye. From the third person, it would look like a very sexual oriented anime with gore and bondage, yet it's so much more. For only 6 episodes, the anime got very in depth with plot and character development without the realization of how everything ties together so well which comes int he last episode. It was written really well, the voice actresses were definitely very good. The sex scenes and stuff were pretty hot, the action scenes were definitely action packed and gory, and the anime stuck with me pretty easy, I mean it's not hardto forget a green haired immortal private detective (you'd think at least.) Overall, I think this anime is definitely worth the watch.",

            "content": "I came to this right after finishing up Higurashi. \r\nBoth are mystery thrillers and so I thought they go hand in hand together. \r\nBoy was I wrong! To start off, Rin (the anime) is more darker than other mystery thrillers and it takes the supernatural into account. The story is also unique since it takes place over long periods of time. Also, since there are only 6 episodes it has little character development and more plot (I say that with both meanings of the term, if you know what I mean). The animation is also a bit weird, it has less focus during the normalscenes and more detail during the important or action scenes and it isn't bad, but it feels weird. \\n\r\nWhen watching this make sure to open up your mind and accept anything since it isn't your usual anime. \\n\r\nRin (the character) has some kind of underlying conflict that isn't known at the start and isn't very clear as the story progresses and her background isn't clear either. So like Higurashi, expect to be confused and amazed at the same time. It is definitely a great anime to watch and I have no doubt that you'll like it.",

            "content": "I'll be straight up and mention right now that I hate an over abundance of fan service, especially when it doesn't have a point. In some ways in regards to this series, it does have some type of a point and I understand that it's necessary. However, the creators of Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne certainly need to turn on Sesame Street for today's word... Moderation. The series definitely had potential to be better but due to very amateurish techniques. The series sexual content wasn't as effective as it first began, and later resulted in being nothing more than a joke.\r\nRin for the most part isa series that entertained me in some ways. The series utilizes Greek and Norse mythology in its symbolism, while also combining eroticism, violence, torture, and wild ambitions as its themes. Even though I don't consider the series to be a brain twister at the very least. It sometimes hits its mark and can keep some viewers glued to the screen, if they can stomach most of the content that is. More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series is pretty good. The animation is fluid with character movements and most of the action scenes are cool to watch. Although a few came off somewhat disturbing, it was nothing mind blowing. The only real issue I have with the animation is the bad use of stills. Few things annoy me more than to see a character walking while everyone else is motionless. The character designs fit well with the style of the anime, and Rin is definitely as sexy as can be, but I do believe it could have done without the use of younger looking side characters. I know what I like in my anime, and personally for a series of this nature, I would have preferred the adult look for all of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe series also has some pretty nice backgrounds with dark settings at times, but I don't believe they all had the best feel due to the BGM simply not fitting well. Since I'm on the subject of music. Even though they sound nice. I find both opening and ending themes, which happen to be rock scores not fitting with some of the imagery during the opening and closing themes, or with the style of the series. I'm beginning to think this series wasn't meant to be taken serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is episodic in nature, and a real plot doesn't begin until much later. The stand alones are paced rather well with small story elements given, instead of taking the easy route by using only action scenes to push the plot. However, don't take this the wrong way. There are a few action scenes present, but I don't consider this approach a bad thing at all. Mainly because the various story elements work into the suspense, plus shed a tad bit of background on the characters. The episodes are far and away from boring that's for sure, and while some series may have trouble with transitioning from one present setting to another. Rin manages to shift from one era to the next, and make it seem so natural in the process. The direction of the series does have its shining moments.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the characters. I only found them interesting in regards to the mystery surrounding them, but after several things about them are revealed. I found very little reason to care about most of them. This is especially in regards to the secondary, whom come off and fill the roles as any typical foil characters would. They mainly push the plot and nothing more, while Rin happens to be the most interesting as it should be for a main character anyway. The lead antagonist had a spark at first but later became too typical for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to what I guess is probably going to make or break the series, and this happens to be its graphic content. The series tries its best to be disturbing, while displaying its horror like torture elements and overall violent scenes. What I feel mildly saves it, is that the director tries to make sense of it all during the climax, and I think it works out. However, the sexual content and fan service is a double edged sword from hell. When the sex and fan service were used in conjunction with horror and revealing additional character's drives, it was effective; but when it was used repeatedly and only tossed in to take up run time, plus give the guys something to drool over. It no longer worked out. When you see a character with the bodily appearance of a young girl engaging in lesbian acts with an older looking woman, after the reasoning of the first interaction has already been established. Then later witness a group of girls engaging in an orgy. You have to question one's motivation here. This is my point about \"mature\" meaning not for kids. It's a good thing these scenes are nicely spread apart.\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said that I wasn't disappointed with this in some ways. The series was hampered by a writing team that pushed the plot in crumby ways at times; but I would also be lying if I said my enjoyment was very low. There's quite a bit of good to be found here, with possibly the biggest notable thing being the complete absence of random comedy. I really hate when comedy is stuffed into a series with dark content. This approach doesn't lighten up the mood, but instead ruins it and robs the series of its credibility. Now, in regards to the women. If the constant use of female nudity and lesbian acts sounds like a turn off. Then I recommend coming into this with caution. For the guys, well most won't have a problem with the sexual content, and if you seen Hostel, then the torture scenes aren't much at all.\\n\\n\r\nHighs: A good amount of style and substance\\n\\n\r\nLows: Fan service and graphic content will put off many viewers, opening/ending themes feel awkward",

Just another sexually-charged anime that takes delight in systematically brutalizing it's female leads and tieing up a convoluted plot with an 8 minute conclusion and some headscratching exposition.

The violence is in your face, and until the very end you really don't worry about the main characters dying. But this isn't all, i would still award the first four episodes a seven or maybe even eight rating as Rin herself is an amazing character and i really enjoyed the use of timeskips in the show, but then the endingcame along and fucked it all up. It's riddled with more (Plot)holes than Apos' sex slaves and kills off a character, whose death, i assume, one should care about, but doesn't, because he was introduced in the last fucking minute. It almost seems as if they thought they had 12 episodes for the story and were told that it's only six after episode 4. I really wish i could rate this show higher, but i have rarely seen such a bad ending.",

            "content": "Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi, also known in English as Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, should have been a porn. Straight up! But for some odd reason it got made into an anime that just is WRITTEN like a hentai. Not to say that Rin isn't enjoyable at times. \r\n\t\t\u25cb Mnemosyne follows the story of two immortal, indestructible women who can only truly be killed by being fucked and devoured by male angels. If that's not extremely convoluted, I don\u2019t know what is. \r\n\t\t\u25cb Around the same time that I watched this series, I also absorbed a weird manga that also should have been a hentai called TokyoAkazukin, in which a female Alucard, ahem, I mean little red riding hood wants her big bad wolf to devour her, so she sleeps with a bunch of old dudes? What? If you like Mnemosyne, you're sure to like Tokyo Akazukin, for all who actually watch the show after I tear it apart. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I mean, like I said, it had good moments. Each episode is forty-five minutes long and the directing has a cinematic feel to it.  It also is really cool that there is a prolific time skip in every episode that shows the mortal characters aging, while the main two girls stay the same, as well as different time period settings for every episode. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The soundtrack is bangin', along with the fluid animation, good ideas (I hesitate to say \u201cgood\u201d in this instance, but the anguish the characters seem to feel from immortality is a good angle for character exploration), and pretty designs; but, I would probably say that the music is my favorite part of this series. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb The visuals are mostly stunning due to Shigeru Ueda, the notorious director behind Serial Experiments Lain, so if you're a fan of that show than you might seriously appreciate the visual aspects of this one.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb The series turns itself into a dud\u30fcby attempting to mix character drama with eroticism reminiscent to Highschool DxD but with dirtier implications; examples of these strange moments are like: an angel flys, carrying a shirtless woman\u30fclike an eagle with a mouse wriggling in its claws, while groping her and eating her while she's moaning. That's just ridiculous. It's also super rape-y that the immortal women, literally, can't resist that angels and get super horny against their will when the angels are around.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb For those of you who are into Devilman, which I hope some of you are, since I have a fixation with it. Apos, the main villain, looks and acts like Ryou Asuka. The design is pretty much exported from Go Nagai. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb I don't hate Mnemosyne, in fact, I actually thought it was cool when I first watched it as a teenager, but I can't support torture porn that tries to be deeper than it actually is. If you want something that looks pretty with fanservice, and you don't want to put much thought into it, then Mnemosyne is for you. It is also done by Xebec, and they're known for beautiful-looking butts.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb Another interesting aspect of the show is that the name Mnemosyne means memory, the Greek word being the origin of the word mnemonic. As the title suggests, memory loss is a theme in the show, as well as focus on the Tree of Life mythos. Verily, the story could have became something really good if it had actually been a series that focused on story rather than sexualization. More characters dives (Mimi needs more love) rather than pure atmosphere, high production values, and, well, hot girls.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\u25cb Overall, if you want something meaningless to watch that\u2019s moderately inventive with directorial decisions, sure; but skip if you don\u2019t want to waste time\u30fchalf of the series is complete nonsense. It contains a bounty of value with campy humor, it can be a very fun show, but I often wonder: how thin is our generation\u2019s line in the sand when it comes between stupidity and entertainment? A little food for thought. I give Mnemosyne a 4/10.",

Did Rin always talked on the phone with the previous guardian?\r\nStory:\r\nIn my opinion the core part of the story is interesting (I don't want to spoil so I won'tmention anything specifically) and how the story begins and all the way to the end was unusual for me somewhat but it was done good. There were unnecessary sexual scenes (homo & hetro) in every episode which to me almost looked like a cheap trick to gather more viewers and revenue and that's a huge let down and hindrance for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation:\\n\\n\r\nSo it's a ten years old anime so I'm not the best judge but anyway the art looked good though I believe it could have been better and there were very few problems with animation.\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sounds:\\n\\n\r\nAs always no problem with sounds and music was done well rather than good as I felt the timing they played the OST of choice was good and I also would've preferred the same OST though they should've had more good OSTs for action scenes. Nonetheless these OSTs played a huge role in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nSo I have no problems with the MC and about the Maeno family almost no problem but if there was a little past about how Mimi and Rin partnership happened that would be a good thing but she wasn't that important just like the assassin and about Apos, all things were clared about that guy in the end but I believe it would add more interest if we had gotten more on the relationship of Apos and Taji.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nWell I personally view it as a fantasy, crime/detective, sci-fi anime with a little bit of uninteresting action and despite those scenes I mentioned It's actually good and enjoyable and yes I would recommend it to others who prefer the above genre.",

Primarily what. from start to finish, this is a vague show that while it answers what it needs to, it never answers anymore which had me almost begging for what I wanted to know. It also has time skips every episode and I tend to hate them. Here they feel well placed and gives an extra sense of repetition. There is one thing I can see people disliking and that's the heavy presence of sexual acts, forced bdsm, and themesthat make others uncomfortable. Would I recommend Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi? If you can't handle dark themes like what I've mentioned then do give it a hard pass, but if you're okay with it, I do recommend at least you look into it further. It is quite unique.",

Now, while I am a fan of writing super long, winding reviews with lots of points and rambling, I'll keep this one short.\r\nWhy?\r\nWhile it may say that I have completed this show, that's a lie.  By the end of episode 4, I dropped it.  So why does it have the best rating I have ever given anything?  Well, to put it simply,\r\nThis show was so good that I stopped watching it because I couldn't stand to see it end.\r\nIdidn't want closure to the story.  I didn't want to see these people continue on their journey, because in another 80 minutes it would be over.  I wanted the show to live on in my memory and only there.  I will never re-watch it.  I very rarely think about it, but so much of what I do, the stories I write, the themes I discuss, what draws me to a show in the first place, was brought about largely through this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I like this show so much?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.  This is the only anime I have ever watched that made me legitimately care about it's characters.  Mostly because it's the only anime I've ever watched that actually wanted me to care about the characters.  Now, I know, I could watch any slice-of-life show and see a show about characters, but those are people.  They're just people.  They don't do anything I couldn't do.  they don't provide anything more for me then just a black hole into \"entertainment\" (I'm not huge on slice-of-life, could you tell?).  I have a similar attitude towards Bebop and shows like that too, but they follow the action anime philosophy rather then the SoL philosophy.  They care about showing you something with characters in it to tie you to the situation, but not about the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis show cares about it's characters.\\n\\n\r\nMany people find something, be it a book, movie, video game, or show, that they feel was built for them and them alone.  This is that for me.  Yes, it's slow and visceral and has an absolutely nasty tone, but it is the only truly character driven anime I have ever seen, and it does it so well I actually cried multiple times.\\n\\n\r\nIt really is a show that everyone should watch before they die.  Even if you don't like it, I hope you can appreciate it for what it is.",

            "content": "Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne is an odd experience. One's likely to spend the majority of it's run-time at the very least intrigued by the thematic elements being presented. To a 'new' anime watcher it will seem unique and 'Unlike anything else in anime'! And yet once the finale arrives, and once the series concludes itself, one thought will likely be left in the mind.\r\n\u201cWhat the heck just happened?\u201d\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nMnemosyne's plot flows like many other experimental works. By spending the two-thirds or so of it's runtime going through self-contained arcs, it sets up the main cast, and the world itself, in a way that's always opento new developments. And that's a HUGE plus, because this is Mnemosyne's strongest suit. Despite only being 6 episodes, it's very easy to get a feel for the growth and change of the world, from a time still in our recent memory, into a theoretical future swaddled in wonder. Every year covered has plenty of plot points and nods to the smallest social developments and their rippling effect in to the lives of the main characters, and how it alters the way that they must deal with the thrilling mysteries of the current arc.\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, this is a Thriller/Detective show at heart...usually. And by usually, I mean whenever it isn't glorifying extreme sexuality and violence. Yes, we're hitting levels of sex and gore that only can be matched by the height of the Late 80's OVA boom, with a tits-to-screentime ratio surpassing even that of Game of Thrones! And this ends up inadvertently hindering the story. With these elements taking up so much of the work, it almost serves as a harsh gatekeeper, slamming a rod-iron fence shut on the face of a casual viewer who might shy away from Yuri, Sexuality, and Gore/Torture. What makes it even more disappointing is that these elements are always meshed in well with the work. I'll point to Episode 5, where in preparation for a conflict, one of the main characters proceed to spend at least a solid minute and a half engaged in a passionate lesbian orgy while overlaid voices inform the viewer of the defense plan. Oh sure, a degenerate such as myself will eat that up, but the visuals and the audio are not complimenting each other or the overall story, and only serve to be the final piece of a character arc that plateaus right afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have to look at the final episode. Where everything goes off the pre-established rails. What had been a mystery series with an immortal duo weathering the sands of time warps into a bizarre dive into feminist ideology, a study of gender identity, nuclear war, and twists designed to be gut-wrenching that just invoke a 'what' from the viewer. This genre shift isn't the worst thing, and it actually handled much, much better then what numerous other works have tried and failed to do. But it feels closer to a overachieving visionaries' anime-only conclusion to a manga-adaptation then a natural conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, these are the only real harms. Beyond these significant issues, and the handful of odd hiccups that any work will suffer, Mnemosyne is a rather simple concept to grasp, just a pair of immortals with a few mortal friends tackling thrilling mysteries through time. Meaning that once you get around the gate-keeping 'maturity' and bizarre conclusion, it's not anything to be disappointed with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThink for a moment of other works containing immortal beings as a primary selling point. It usually consists of enough angsting that you could create a Early-2000's era Nu-Metal band. As cringe-inducing as the following words usually are, there is an element in truth in it. Mnemosyne isn't here to angst about the problems of immortality, and that lack of angst alone makes the work intriguing. Oh sure, there's a bit of self-analysis in the opening episode, but its' far from what you'd expect from \u201cLesbian Sherlock Holmes meets The Highlander.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, however, suffers from just being too clear and clean-cut. Other then a slight twist to the formula in episode 5, Rin (Our primary character) reads like an open book. She's your typical Anime Woman of the Fighting variety...just that her main ability is being a bullet/blast sponge, leading to her often ending up on the loosing end of a battle. That doesn't keep her from being a solid paragon of a strong female lead, but everything she's going to say is something you'll have heard in some variation from any other 'Take Action!' female lead. Even with other characters, she just doesn't seem to change much from interactions compared to the life-altering events that she's providing others. Maybe this is just a normal development for someone who's been around for thousands of years, and should be expected. But it still leads to a letdown.\\n\\n\r\nNot as much of a letdown as Mimi, our other primary character. As Rin's flirtatious immortal loli girlfriend (with some sprinkles of the Tsundere variety just so we hit every possible mainstream waifu criteria), one would hope that we can get some intriguing dynamics. And we honestly get...nothing. Oh sure, there's nudges and nods to what appears be a strong relationship between the two, but the series spends a lot of time with the two of them separated, or in situations that the dynamics of their character interactions just can't be expanded on, and Mimi just doesn't shine on her own. There is the subtle character arc she goes through as the toll of immortality chips on her mind, and makes her feel gradually more and more bored with Rin and everything in general...but good god the arc just sorta drops off because the last episode casts aside all of these types of things. (More on that in a bit).\\n\\n\r\nThe partner-of-the-year characters honestly are the most intriguing characters of the show. As we get the ability to see them grow slower with age and wiser from experience, it's a very engaging showcase of long-term growth. Indeed, if the audience is going to feel any emotional connection to the main female lead, it will likely be because of how solid the supporting character almost always is, and how we're able to pick up on the different types of relationships they have with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOH yeah, I did say more on that final episode, didn't I? Well, recall how I said that while being transparent and simplistic as glass, our main female lead is at least a strong female lead? Throw that out the window for the finale. IN fact, throw just about all characterization out for the final episode. It's not needed. At any one time, at least one of the three (Four if you count the villain) main character is spending their time grinding their thighs together, fighting against the ridiculous hormonal drives that plot kicks into gear. Not to mention that while that's going on, chances are that at least one character (It may even be the same one!) is groaning from being impaled, sliced, or tortured in some other way. Characters who aren't being made a quivering mess of animalistic lust or bloody stumps are content to stand around, being useless or rattle off exposition for the plot-switch that has happened. If there's anything that the finale does absolutely wrong, it's a failure to use the characters as anything more then plot devices to drag itself from Point A to B to C.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this though, the series just falls flat on characters, but that's really because it realizes that the extended cast just isn't going to contribute. If it's not our episodic 5-minutes of pointless revenge, or our villain of the episode, no effort is expended at all on them. It's up to the viewer to decide if this hinders the work by cheapening the world, or betters it by spending more time on the story, which is already the strong suit for the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a difficult one to tackle. The first episode is solid all the way around, and feels like a work from the mid-2010's as opposed to the late 2000's. But after that the quality drops and wavers, and by the end it's not really much different from anything else during it's airtime. This goes double for the animation, with a wonderful cold-open but an awkward moment during the climax where the blood from a massive gash on the back suddenly phases through a trembling body. The backgrounds are solid, but never anything to really write home about, with the only stand-out being the Tree of Visual Exposition (as I like to call it) and it's spores of Plot Armor! The character designs aren't anything to write home about, and after the fourth episode it's clear that any creativity in this department had already been used up.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, I guess I would say that it's closest comparison for a era-similar work would be ufotable's Garden of Sinners films. Both works have solid background art, and solid particle physics (Even if Mnemosyne's 'particles' are at least 20 times larger and aren't just a a dust-physics simulator). You might even take a few screenshots of the backgrounds and make them your desktop wallpaper for a week or so. But it's not something you'll call your friends up about and tell them about. 7/10 might seem generous, but that first episode is danm solid, and mix that with a handful of other good moments and otherwise average art overall, and you'll get a slightly-higher-then-average score.\\n\\n\r\nSound Design: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing with Sound Design. Like the art/animation, it seems like all creativity in this department vanished early. It's never BAD, let's make that clear. Galneryus provides a wonderful opening and ending, the first actually being one of the rare, lusted after 'Japanese songs with Understandable English', while the closing work is a somewhat melancholic track that bursts into hopeful energy, creating a usually fitting end for the episodes. But it's telling how middlingly average the sound design is when there is just nothing to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for everything this series threw at me, so when it comes to personal enjoyment, yes, it's a 10/10 out of the gate. Even when the work got downright bizarre at the end, it never stopped being true to it's promises. If you like the Hyper-Violent and Hyper-Sexualized OVA's of the 1980's and early 1990's, this might be up your alley. Likewise, if you enjoy a series with mystery elements, yeah, this is for you. And if you enjoy Shoujo-Ai or Yuri at the most explicit, this is definitely for you. For fans of any of these things, Enjoyment is likely to come, because the series is just so honest and out there with it. There's no beating around the bush. No need for senseless debates on if it's just yuri-baiting, or how badly a work has been censored. It's all there, and it's waiting for you to relish in it, regardless if you think its' trashy to like this sort of thing, or a hallmark of mature 'adult' taste.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Final Words\\n\r\nRin: Daughters of Mnemosyne is an interesting tale. Interesting not only in itself, but in its' place in anime. Much like the hyper-violent/hyper-sexualized tales from the 80's like Violence Jack or AD Police, there is a market for Mnemosyne. But that market it small. What was once ahead-of-its' time artwork is already becoming dated, and within time it will no longer even be seen as 'acceptable', falling into the trappings of 'ew, old anime looks bad'. Mixed with a story that goes through a very unexpected shift late in the going, and the general lack of 3-Dimensional characters beyond sidekicks, and it's just bound to a sorry fate. It will likely be forgotten to the sands of time, left as just a reminder in blog posts on how 'uncool and over-the-top' anime was before it shaped up and got better.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you liked it, it's an experience you won't forget. It's the kind of thing that'll make you smile and say \u201cHell yeah, that's what I enjoy anime for.\u201d Rather it be for mystery, thematic exploration, yuri, gore, sexuality, or something else, it'll be satisfying for you. And at the end, the one thought in your mind will be:\\n\\n\r\n\"What the heck just happened? Oh well, it was super cool and worth the watch!\"\\n\\n\r\nEnd Rating: 7.7, rounded up to 8.",

I would recommend it but notice that the rate is pretty high so maybe you shouldn't watch it at a young age.\r\nOtherwise I loved the confused emotion that would arise in the beginning of an episode but at the end of it you'll come to a closer understanding in bits and piecesbut still not fully understanding it in whole. It's a well crafted story with a steady revealing pace and yet it shocks you to the core. Maybe not in a fearful way but anticipation, excitement and sometimes you hold your breath without knowing it. Because the anime only has 6 episodes and it takes time to sub them for me it felt like an eternity before the next episode came out however it gave me a reasonable time to think over and revise what I know and don't know. So in all and all I really enjoyed this anime and am a bit sad that it's the end.",

            "content": "So, I watched this series through twice, the reason being, so I could get a hold of my opinions on it. A friend of mine said that it had an original story and aesthetic that I would appreciate if it weren't for the gore and liberal use of sex and nudity. I took this as a challenge (I don't care for anything sadistic, and think that sex and nudity should be used as seasonings for a story, not what they revolve around) and did watch, but I can't say that I'm not still a little confused.\r\nThe Good:\r\n1) This is an original story for sure. Iwould have gone with more of a 'trials of the immortal' thing than the story did, but that's my preference. 2) I'm a fan of these time skips. It shows the characters in a completely different character when you see them in the next episode 20 years later. Plus, it reminds me, somewhat, of Kara no Kyoukai. 3) It made me think. I will profess to enjoying mindlessness on occasion, but I enjoy it when there are things I don't know, am confident will be revealed, then realize I should have seen them from the beginning in hindsight. 4) The main characters can, or may not be, the most interesting characters in your mind. As the description says, we're talking about immortals here, so that can be hard to relate to, but the secondary characters, to me anyway, pepper the narrative with what makes it good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n1) Sex should not play an integral role unless the story is a romance or smut. I realize this is an opinion, but when talk of sexual arousal stopping a hardened female action character comes up, I find it difficult to swallow. 2) If you want to be mature, and appeal to a mature audience (as your rating seems to insinuate), using a juvenile 'blood and boobs' routine isn't going to help. 3) The intro song. Yes it's petty, but it doesn't change the fact that it suckered me in with a fair musical score and ruined it with j-rock lyrics sung by the one kid who failed his english classes. There's a reason I don't sing in Japanese, despite knowing how to, at least, communicate on a daily level in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ambiguous:\\n\r\n1) Gender politics. I don't know if the creators are trying to make a message out of what happens when men and women gain power followed by the interactions of said parties, but it comes across that way. Maybe that's how it supposed to be. The main character kicks enough ass to put the Levi jeans company into overdrive, but is still forced to submit at times (normally in a sexual manner; see 'The Bad' section on that).\\n\r\n2) The Sexual Politics. Again, this is a sort of gender politics thing that I can't get too much into without going into spoiler territory, but I will say there is a lesbian threesome during which important information is shared among the participants. Now, as an adult male, let me say, this information could have been presented better. It was certainly artistic and erotic, but difficult to hear over the sexual groans of those involved. Added to that is that, apparently, the best way to get information relevant to plot points is to sexually satisfy a nymphomaniac lesbian (or bisexual, it was never made clear). This could have been handled better, but I don't know if the anime as a whole could maintain its identity without such... accoutrements. \\n\r\n3) What is actually happening? Keeping your audience in the dark until just the right moment is a skill few possess. In this anime, the dark shifts back and forth between knowing and not knowing. While generally well paced on an episodic level, I would have preferred a more cohesive whole than what was presented, despite the fact that I appreciate the segments on their own. It would probably be better to assess those segments (episodes) individually with more scrutiny, but they do all interconnect.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI can't give you any real insight. Go ahead and watch the series for yourself (6 episodes, 45 minutes each) and have your own opinion. You could almost argue that this is an anime for forcing you into creating your own opinion on some issues that come up in modern life or fantasy. But always remember to keep an open mind. Read the other reviews and they might provide more insight than mine ever could.",

            "content": "I would like to begin by saying I did not think I was going to like this work. I began watching the first episode \"as a favor\" with my friend and thought to myself 'great another fun filled ride of gore and sexy lesbians always wanting to get their kit off, this will be just like Gantz only worse. Bring on the late night madness.\" And boy was I proven so astoundingly wrong. \r\nNow, given the amount of gratuitous sex, blood, and gore this anime has to offer it would be easy (and simple) to cast this off as just another late night movie ontele with little to offer; except it isn't. Now in my case, after 15 minutes or so (about the time we're introduced to Mimi) I was just floored by how much I liked it. My aforementioned friend asked me after two episodes \"so what do you think?\" (A question I had been dreading he would ask me from the moment he made the suggestion to watch.) To which I gave him a wide eyed look and said \"MORE!!!\" But sadly I only had time that day for the first three and ended on an emotional note, it took me weeks to finally find the time to watch the last three installments I had been craving since I left.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most surpising elements, for me, was how much I just liked and cared about the wellfare of the characters involved. This is always pretty big for me, because I find too many anime, particularly those of this genre or feel to them, don't pay much attention to their characters and then I don't care about them and I get bored unless something pretty grabs my attention (like Koyasu Takehito). But this wasn't the case here, I worried about them and when someone was hurt or killed I felt an emotional reaction to it. I laughed with their jokes and wanted to know more about them. My favourite character was Mimi, which I didn't expect given that she is your basic hacker-genius admin slave who just drinks vodka all day and pleads for Rin to save her somewhat regularly. But I loved her and couldn't imagine what the show would have been like for me without her. \\n\\n\r\nOh, speaking of crucial elements, did I mention that my friend made us watch this on Netflix? For those who don't know, Netflix online streaming is, so far as I'm able to discern, DUB only (I felt some of you out there in NetLand shudder. Well, me too, but stay tuned kids!) so I tend to stay far away from it with ten foot poles. Needless to say it was not working in Rin's favor that I was being force watch not only what I thought of as trash but DUBBED trash no less. I was not keen on this prospect. So imagine my terrific surprise when I found that not only was I not horrified by the voice actors in question for this, I actually enjoyed them. I know, I know. *shudder shudder*  \\n\\n\r\nI have since watched it in Japanese and while the seiyuu for the show were talented, (I can't BELIEVE I am writing this!!) I genuinely prefer the English voice cast for this anime... somewhere Japanese voice coach and my anime sensei are crying. Not only that, (please don't commit seppuku, Sensei-san) I am not actively looking for other series some of them were involved in so I can watch them!! In ENGLISH!!!!!!! Oh goodness me, I think my mother has fainted away and died. Sorry mama-chan. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering this was basically a made-for-late-night-tele OVA, I was particularly impressed by how talented the seiyuu were for this series and the amount of work that obviously went into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this was the performance of Apos, played brilliantly by Todd Haberkorn, who was so convincing as a villian that I was certain they would cast Hayami Show or Takahashi Hiroki for the part. There was really a depth and a sense of how twisted his mind really was and I was truly impressed by it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story was another factor I didn't expect to like, but after 15 minutes or so of the first episode I was completely hooked in and couldn't wait for more. It also has a nice pace in lieu of the fact that the viewer has a lot to process and the time span we're dealing with can change drastically in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this might have worked for a full series, and I certainly wouldn't have complained getting to know the characters more I think this actually worked in the time frame it was given. As this wasn't that complicated a series, six episodes was enough to give the audience everything it needed to understand the concepts portrayed through the plot. I suppose this could have been fleshed out more, but I think it was strong as it was though truthfully, the ending was too deus-ex-machina for my taste but then even high budget work like Paprika! fall into that category, so I can't really get riled up with a story as interesting as this one just because the ending is a little bit 'meh'. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend Mnemosyne: Daughters of Mnemosyne to those who are over 18 and prefer (or don't mind) series such as Elfin Lied or Claymore, which have lots of blood but a good plot to keep a person interested who is looking for one; or even Read or Die. I know that seems like an odd mix, but throughout the series I was frequently reminded of R.O.D. for one reason or another. It just had a similar feel to it and Rin reminded me of a collective of R.O.D. characters. The detective aspect and especially the music also reminded me of Cowboy Bebop, but that was where the comparison for me ended. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who liked Gantz, I would definitely recommend this series as the amounts of sex and gore has tripled, however I felt this had a richer storyline and more interesting characters, so if you don't like plot with fast forward or just watch hentai.",

It felt like the optical illusions, where the shapes are drawn and outlined in such a way that your eyes trick your mind into seeing color, when there is actually nocolor whatsoever. To that end, I started thinking about what little I know about the feminist philosophy, how from my limited understanding the most extreme versions of it call for the superiority of women over men while fighting off lustful possessive desires in the face of men, creating a sort of lopsided dichotomy, and the role of artificial insemination in an overpopulated society.\\n\\n\r\nOn the spot brainstorming may seem like a good thing, but really, it just means that my mind was so bored that it just started going in every direction except the direction that Mnemosyne tried leading me toward. In a way, everything has its purpose, from being the glue that sticks things together, to the book that explains an idea, to even the rule of cool. I just could not find anything like that here, and the porn wasn't even that interesting.",

            "content": "\"It only hurts forever.\"\r\nRin: Daughters of Mnemosyne, or it's Japanese title Mnemosyne: Mnemosyne no Musume-tachi, is an anime that is absolutely not for children. It contains all kinds of nudity, violence, gore, and torture porn. It plays with themes of death, mythology, dominance, and the dark side of sexuality. It is not for the faint of heart, and you should go into this anime prepared for what is in store.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe premise of Mnemosyne is pretty straightforward and unique.The mythological tree Yggdrasil appears every once in a while and gives off these small orbs. Some of which are different than the rest, these are referred toas \"time fruit\". When a time fruit is absorbed by a human, they are transformed. Women turn into Immortals, who cannot die and do not age, and Men become Angels, who can die and usually do in a few weeks. So far it sounds interesting, here's where I have a problem with it: When an Immortal and an Angel are nearby each other, they have an overwhelming desire to have sex with each other, whether they want to or not. And when they have sex, the Angel eats the Immortals time fruit and she dies. This kind of premise  is like that of a very sick Hentai. The actual story is good, with the protagonists solving the cases that they are presented with, their encounters with a few recurring characters, and a very evil individual's plan to absorb the memories of others and become the eternal guardian of Yggdrasil. The story is slow in the very beginning but as it continues it draws you in more and the twists and turns in the plot become very interesting and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe protagonists, Rin and her alcoholic partner Mimi, are both immortals who run a private investigation firm. They are joined my Kouki after the first episode and throughout the series, him and his family are an integral part of the plot. Behind it all is Apos, main antagonist and master of puppets who is on a mission make Rin and her friends suffer. The plot takes place over 65 Years and all of the main characters get a good share of development and it is very interesting to see the characters intentions and how their stories unfold \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art if the show is very beautiful in a sick, gruesome, and terrifying way. The animation itself is fluid and pleasant, with particular attention going to the gore and torture scenes, and the machinery that makes the torture possible. It is very clear that the artists have some knowledge of medieval architecture, weaponry, mythological figures, and even BDSM.  The expressions and movements on the characters faces are detailed and realistic and it adds to the whole disturbing feeling that the anime succeeds at bringing about.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Mnemosyne is AWESOME. The opening and ending themes are done by Japanese Power Metal band Galneryus. Both themes suit the subject matter of the OVA perfectly. The opening is sung in English and the lyrics relate to the show and it makes it that much more awesome. The background tracks range from some suspenseful horror piano and violin sounds to some heavy metal in the more action-packed parts of the show. The OST adds to the dark and gruesome nature of the show and makes the show much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n+Kick-ass soundtrack\\n\r\n+Original Plot\\n\r\n+Interesting character progression and development\\n\r\n+Detailed Animation and Art\\n\\n\r\n-Short run time \\n\r\n-Hentai-like premise\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are mature enough to handle some gory violence and sexual themes, there should be something for you to enjoy in this anime.",

            "content": "Story- Extreme Yuri. Oh my god. The first Yuri Anime I have ever watched. People of any age, even animals, can become immortal from little sparkles of light. Angels are the only ones that can kill the immortal. Brutal killings happen. It revolves around Rin, an immortal soul. From the beginning there is intense gambling, Yuri, and HUGE Yuri sex scenes. The story was good, but it only lasted 6 episodes with a cliff hanger.\r\nArt- The art was fantastic. Especially when you see Rin from 1982 to like 2045. It gives you a general idea of what the future may be. AND IT IS AWESOME.\r\nSound-The sound was okay. The only thing I liked was the opening theme, it was very catchy. If any of you are metal heads out there, you will definetly like it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Characters were explained very well, and their background stories towards each character are explained very well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Enjoyment was decent. I'm not a big fan of Yuri, and the scenes were very awkward to me, but overall a good sum of solving crimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime, I recommend to people who are Yuri extremists. Full detail people.",
