            "content": "Since 2006, light novel adaptations have gradually become a regular feature in anime as producers in the industry scrabble around in their attempts to find the biggest cash cow since the advent of Suzumiya Haruhi. The surprising thing is that the fallout from this has actually been a lot better for fans than one might expect, and while titles like Guin Saga, Kemono no Souja Erin, Ghost Hunt, Baccano!, Kure-nai, Rental Magica, Spice & Wolf, and NHK ni Youkoso! may not be as commercially successful as KyoAni's behemoth, they do represent a gradual shift in the industry towards creativity and originality.\r\nWhich is where Katanagatari comesin to the picture.\\n\\n\r\nWritten by Nisio Isin (although he usually writes it as NisiOisiN since his name is a palindrome), the twelve volumes of the original light novel series were published as part of the Kodansha Box line. Strangely, all of the books were released at a rate of one per month from January to December 2007, with a spin off novel published in February 2008. Now while this is clearly a phenomenal feat, one does have to wonder if a few corners were cut for the sake of expediency and to meet deadlines, and also if the adaptation can stand up to scrutiny.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is basically what the title suggests - a story about swords. It begins with fire and death as a rebellion against the Owari shogunate meets a bloody end. Twenty years later, a small boat makes its way across the sea to a deserted island where the passenger, Togame, hopes to enlist the aid of Yasuri Mutsue, the 6th generation head of the Kyoutouryuu sword style and the hero of the rebellion.\\n\\n\r\nInstead she finds Yasuri Shichika, who is more bumpkin than the term allows for, and is also as hard as nails.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that really stands out about the series (aside from the visuals, but we'll get to that in a bit), is the dialogue. The show is very well scripted with some very good conversations and witty repartee, and the explanations are usually clear and concise enough for the viewer to follow. There are also numerous verbal nods in the direction of modern popular culture, which makes a nice change of pace as one might normally expect lots of serious conversations about honour, loyalty, duty, revenge, or other concepts that are usually found in these types of story.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem though, is that the dialogue can also be off putting for viewers who want a little less conversation, a little more action (sing along if you know the words), especially as the fights are over in a very short space of time. In addition to this the story can sometimes err on the side of predictable, especially with the number of plot coupons that drive the whole show (in this case the \"cursed\" swords), and the series can sometimes become nothing more than a repetition of talk, talk, talk, fight, talk, end. The biggest criticism about Katanagatari though, is that it's nothing more than a very nice looking \"fetch quest\", and while the dialogue really does pull the whole show together, the storyline can sometimes feel derived or contrived.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes the series stand out are the rather stylized visuals. The design principle attempts to merge several themes ranging from traditional Japanese art to modern fighting games, and while there are some flaws here and there, the overall effect is ... something else. The scenery is surprising to say the least, and almost every frame is literally filled with little details that will often go unnoticed by the viewer, from the grain and different tones found in wood, to the multiple hues and fractures of stone.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to this the characters are simplistic yet colourfully flamboyant. The costumes vary from the utilitarian to the nonsensical (especially those of the Maniwa ninja corps), while the characters themselves have exaggeratedly simple, almost cartoon-like, facial features. Oddly enough, whilst one might expect this sort of design to lack in terms of expression, the opposite is true for Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox, who produced Tears to Tiara and are currently working on Stein's Gate, have done a tremendous job with the design and animation of this series. The characters have a certain grace about their movements that belies their simplistic appearance and sometimes clunky costumes, while actual combat scenes are extremely well choreographed and animated, so much so that the individual moves of Shichika Hachiretsu (Seven hits, Eight Pieces), are clearly defined.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the art style may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you can handle it then there's a pretty good story here.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the defining aspects of a good narrative is the strength of the scriptwriting, and because of the extremely strong dialogue in this anime, it's often easy to overlook how good the actors actually are. Hosoya Yoshimasa's role as the \u00fcber country bumpkin Yasuri Shichika may have caused him some consternation as the character is effectively emotionless for a good portion of the series. That said, his deadpan delivery works very well, and can often make the viewer stop and try to work out if what he says is meant to be a joke. On the other hand, Tamura Yukari's not-quite-tsundere Togame is sometimes a joy to watch, with the character's many mood swings and emotional changes handled with aplomb. But then again, what else would one expect from an actress who's also played Takamichi Nanoha, Kawasumi Mai (Kanon), Furude Rika (Higurashi), and a horde of other lead and supporting roles.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, given that Hosoya only has a handful of shows under his belt it's amazing he managed to keep his head working alongside such an experienced seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari features quite a lot of music in the form of two opening themes, twelve ending themes, and a plethora of background tracks. The OPs and EDs are handled well, but given the number of songs on offer, deciding what works and what doesn't is very much a matter of personal taste. The incidental music is another matter, as while there are scenes where the music dominates proceedings, the majority of the series features either very subtle tunes that are almost unnoticeable, or no music whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe nice thing about this approach is that the dialogue doesn't have to fight to lead a particular scene, and while the more subtle background music is pleasant enough, this is ultimately a \"wordy\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of shows like Katanagatari is that they have too many characters for their own good. While Shichika and Togame are played confidently, have some well though out dialogue, and generally bounce off each other like peas on a drum, the same cannot be said of the supporting characters, in particular the Maniwa Corps who seem to be nothing more than a collective of whipping boys whose only role in life is to prove just how strong Shichika and his sister are.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the characters are bad though. Both Shichika and Togame's emotional development is handled in a very competent manner, and as their relationship slowly becomes more defined, so too do their actions change towards each other and the world around them. Unfortunately, while a lot of attention is lavished on the two leads, there is very little left over for the supporting cast, which is a shame as there are some great performances in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow while the series has a lot to recommend it there are some valid criticisms that can be levelled at it, the main one being that Katanagatari is far too \"wordy\". See, the problem is that since the dialogue is very good, someone has decided that the series should have more of it than it actually needs, and the upshot of this is that there are occasions when the characters just go on and on. Now it should be pointed out that a part of this is because the series parodies certain stereotypical behaviours found in shounen anime and manga (and James Bond stories I might add), which is nice, but ultimately unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a strange anime that's part \"fetch quest\", part wuxia tale, and strangely enough, part Seinfeld (i.e lots of people being dryly humourous, deadpan or witty), which isn't a normal combination by any measure. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime for its originality and innovation, as it would have been all too easy for White Fox to follow the tried and tested route for samurai anime, so the fact that they decided to stick with Isin's concept of how the characters should look is laudable.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only the other studios would start broadening their horizons ...",

            "content": "'Katanagatari' ('Tale of Swords') is about Togame, a self-claimed \"General Director of Military and Offering Affairs serving under Yanari Shogun Family of Owari Shogunate\", and Yasuri Shichika, the last inheritor of swordless swordsmanship \"Kyotouryuu\", and their adventure to collect 12 legendary swords.\r\nOriginal work written by the same author as 'Bakemonogatari', this is a dialogue-based series that I cannot recommend to Shounen and other viewers who seek mindless battle scenes, you can ignore my warnings... \"but by that time, you'd be slashed into pieces.\"\r\nThe story of 'Katanagatari' is driven by the characters who stand in the way of the sword gathering. New characters and weapon ofthe month are introduced in every episode. Through negotiation and battles with Togame and Shichika, we learn about their opponents' backgrounds and purpose to fight. It can be said that the story progresses by disposing expendable side characters. The story may be about the main couple gathering the 12 swords, but the show is really all about why people fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this series heavily relies on \u300c\u3059\u3079\u308a\u82b8\u300d, the comedy through deliberately failed attempts to be funny, which in turn creates a humorous atmosphere for its sheer lameness. The frantic pace of conversation was the key to making this comedy style work, as well as the persistence (such as catchphrases, Togame missing the battle, sexual implication etc) in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the series makes character development difficult, but it was made possible by dedicating each episode to a theme or lesson for Shichika, and sometimes Togame.\\n\r\n1: Intro\\n\r\n2: What to protect\\n\r\n3: Purpose\\n\r\n4: Friendship\\n\r\n5: Love/Resolve\\n\r\n6: Conscience/Loneliness\\n\r\n7: Death\\n\r\n8: Human Will\\n\r\n9: Discipline\\n\r\n10: Swordsmanship\\n\r\n11: Fate/Past\\n\r\n12: Freedom/Future\\n\\n\r\nShichika started out as an emotionless weapon that blindly follows Togame's orders, acting as her sword. By facing the variety of opponents in their journey and influence of Togame herself, Shichika gradually grow up as a human being, learning ways of the society and new emotions with each encounter. Character development was excellent. By end of the show, Shichika was no longer a brutal killing machine; he had his own purposes and opinions. Character design was fantastic in this series. Everyone was easily distinguishable. Even those who died quickly had very distinct personalities and features that left lasting impressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter naming was pretty interesting in kanji, such as Shichika --> \"Seven Flowers\", Togame --> wordplay of \u300c\u5341\u304c\u76ee\u300d(Eye is a Cross) and \"Blame\", Hitei-hime --> \"Princess Denial\". Every name basically describes the person.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the characters is that every adversary in this show had a sympathetic or honorable reason to fight. They were too lovable. I believe there should be at least one character for everyone to hate in this type of action/adventure series. There should've been an enemy who was simply a serial killer who loved taking life, or a corrupt leader oppressing the innocent civilians. I also felt sorry for Maniwani, for being defeated (often easily) in every single battle against Shichika or Sword-holders.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode summarizes and concludes the series well, lots of cool action, and the funniest scene occurred in stage 10 of dojo-yaburi, with Hakari the Scale. I also liked how in the end, it showed that possession of powerful weapon is pointless unless the wielder has the skill and knowledge to make full use of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI still consider 'Bakemonogatari' voice acting to be the best ever, but 'Katanagatari' is a close second. Togame (Tamura Yukari)'s voice takes a while to get used to, but it grew on me in time. Shichika (Hosoya Yoshimasa)'s voice sounds like reading the script at first, but not really; quite humorous and emotional when needed to be. Other than that, everyone else's voice was an instant hit (this is important because some of the characters were dead within minutes of appearance), which is quite a feat because there are over 30 major characters in this series. This is another series that made me think \"Seiyuu sure are amazing\".\\n\r\nBGM, on the other hand, makes a strong case for a new benchmark. It should be noted that at least one new piece of BGM is played in every episode, but all pieces flows so well that it doesn't sound like deliberate theme music for each villain. Most pieces are fully orchestrated in Western or Japanese traditional instruments, charged with the grandeur of the adventure. Others are jovial Japanese rap that serves its purpose by being so bad that it's funny. However, it's not the quality of individual number that makes the background music of 'Katanagatari' remarkable, rather its application. Every number is used in exactly the right places. The most distinguishable characteristic of the implementation is that the music start well before each significant scene to build up the tension, harmonizing with the story to enhance the drama as they climax with absolute precision.\\n\r\nOP1 was very catchy with good balance of anime beats and traditional Japanese atmosphere, but OP2 was average. EDs are different for every episode. Ep4, 8, 12 were particularly strong songs, but all were shared by outstanding vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter in this series had extremely crude designs, with background detail of varying degree. However, the artwork has a very unique style that creates a Japanese fairytale, picturebook-like atmosphere that suits this series well. One can tell the animation director and staff went lengths to visually compliment the story with wonderful \"camera work\", composition, and fabulous fight scenes.\\n\r\nI want to believe that the character designs are simplified so that they (especially the protagonist) begin as blank canvases, and their impressions and details painted in viewer's minds as the show progress through words.\\n\r\nThe art quality in this series is technically inferior compared to most shows airing this year, but in my opinion had one of the best presentation and style. Probably hit or miss depending on tastes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are limits to episodic storytelling, the show had great character development and interesting story. The story was full of surprises and unpredictable turn of events despite it being a simple tale of sword gathering. Quite innovative and bold in style with both artwork and plot development. There were many great episodes in this series, I hereby declare episode 2, 4, 10, 12 \u300c\u795e\u56de\u300d (godly epic episodes). Episode 7 was one too, though it probably had been possessed by a demon than god in many ways.\\n\r\nPerhaps it's a result of loose deadline due to monthly episode, but you can tell the staff paid close attention to perfect everything, from animation to sound to story structure.\\n\\n\r\nIt was one hell of an adventure around Japan. In spite of all the flaws mentioned above, 'Katanagatari' is a series that I enjoyed tremendously. This series was filled with so many interesting quirks, and I will definitely remember it for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nCheerio! Let's all hype up this word with the wrong meaning.",

            "content": "\"I have just come to a realization! This scroll by Broken Sword contains no secrets of his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest ideal. In the first state, man and sword become one...\" - King of Qin, Hero\r\nI originally stumbled upon this anime thinking it was a continuation of the Monogatari series. It's not. But it's a great show nonetheless. What wowed me about this show was its pacing. Katanagatari is easily one of the most well-paced animes I've ever seen, and the pacing reminds me a lot of BBC's Sherlock series. Each of the 45-minute episodes are like a mini-movie, leaving very littlein terms of cliff-hangers, yet keeps you wanting more, if and when you have time. For me, it made for a good series to relax and watch with my girlfriend on the weekends of my hectic whirlwind lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did I choose to start with a quote from an obscure 2002 Jet Li movie? Well, the one thing that probably caused Katanagatari's score to drop a few points for a lot of people was its ending, which undoubtedly left 90~% of viewers confused and angry. So, I decided to take a metaphorical stab at an explanation (for which I will enlist the help of this obscure 2002 Jet Li movie) that will hopefully shed some light on the true meaning behind Katanagatari, and help you reach a more fulfilling understanding of what the heck you just watched. However, as my explanation contains light spoilers, I will leave it at the end of my review for you to read after you've already finished the series. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the review:\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Katanagatari is both very straightforward and somehow wildy unpredictable. It follows a rinse and repeat cycle where our heroes, Togame (a delicate strategist) and Shichika (an emotionless jungle boy), face off against an enemy with a powerful and unique weapon, find some way to defeat them, and subsequently take their weapon. It may sound dull and repetitive, but the show does a great job of keeping things fresh with cute/clever interactions between Togame and Shichika, who are superstar characters in their own rights, but I'll get to that in a bit. The only thing the story is lacking is depth behind each character's motivations. Togame is collecting swords for the Shogunate, which is the enemy of her loving deceased father, while Shichika is there because... I have no clue. He claims it's because he fell in love at first sight with Togame, but his attraction is rather platonic. I think the real reason was because he was bored. That's not to say their relationship seems fake. Katanagatari doesn't pull love out of thin air like some animes do (*cough* Angel Beats!). While the relationship between Togame and Shichika starts off a little suspicious, and the show doesn't try to hide the fact that Shichika comes off as this asexual weirdo, it develops into something that seems very real by the time we get to the closing credits. Throughout their travels, Shichika undergoes a very subtle transformation from emo-jungle-boy to fun-loving prankster that's shown in the way he interacts and teases Togame. It's all done in a Flowers for Algernon kind of way, meaning the narrator doesn't have to tell us that Shichika and Togame are changing, it's just obvious. It's really refreshing to see an anime that shows us things rather than tells us what to think, wouldn't you agree? (NOD YOUR HEAD) But still, the initial motivations behind each character's actions leaves a lot viewers scratching their heads. This, of course, is compounded by the problems people have with the ending. It's not just Shichika and Togame either. All of the characters have a tendency to act in unpredictable and senseless ways, from Hou-oh, a beloved clan leader randomly decapitating his dear disciple to Shichika's sister running around killing people for no reason. None of their motivations seem to make any sense. But motivations aside, it still gets an 8 out of 10 for it's combination of fun-filled subplots, clever battle sequences, and colorful cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\n- Art (9/10) -\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watch an episode of an action anime and thought, why is there no fighting in this episode? Well, Katanagatari never has this problem. There's fighting in every episode. And while the fighting is not flashy (or forced for that matter), it is very well drawn and sensibly creative. The style is not detailed, except with some of the scenery, and the artist takes liberties with the shape of human bodies and faces, but it's all still very cool looking. It all reminds me a LOT of Gurren Laggan. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it fits well with the style of the anime as a whole. There are two weird things about the artwork that might annoy some people. First, like the artist for Gurren Lagann, this artist doesn't like to draw normal looking eyes. I don't mean having something like the Sharingan of Naruto canon, that's actually connected the story. I mean some characters will just randomly have pentagons for eyes, because why not? And second, the art style changes slightly after the first few episodes (the lines get noticeably thinner). I don't know if this is to show aging (older characters are typically given lighter lines in anime), but it's all made very obvious during flashbacks. But if you can disregard those two things, I'm sure you'll find the graphics as entertaining as I did.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe opening/closing and the music in general fit well with the anime. That's really all I can say about that. The background music has a modern/Sengoku style to it that reminds me a bit of Samurai Champloo, but more Sengoku and less modern than Samurai Champloo (there's very little rap). And obviously, it's by a different composer (RIP Jun Seba). Actually, I think the opening is by the same band that did the Monogatari series. Anyways, it's all very good. The intros/outros are memorable, although neither of them really wowed me. The voice acting was underrated as well. However, I've only seen the sub.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters (9/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the best thing about this show. The main characters, Togame and Shichika are both very distinct and clever. Neither of them fall entirely within any anime cliche. The repertoire between them is great, and they both have some very memorable lines. The development of the characters is relatable as the pair try to find meaning behind why they fight, what it is they're searching for, and what they really want out of life. The side characters are also very interesting. All of the enemies are unique and interesting. In fact, even the guys who only get 10 seconds of screen time are interesting. I'm going to say \"interesting\" one more time for emphasis, just in case you didn't catch the first 30 times I said it. They all have fun quirks about them, and none of them really came off as annoying. One good example of this is the Maniwa Corps, a group of ninjas that are sort of like what Team Rocket is for Ash and Company on Pokemon, but way cooler. The difference is that while Team Rocket is made up almost entirely of storm troopers clones, every single of one of the 12 (14?) Maniwa members are unique. About 5 seconds ago (or 10-30 seconds depending on how fast you read), I mentioned that none of them come off as annoying. Well, that's not entirely true. The fact that their motivations often fail the logic test, as I mentioned earlier, can come off a bit annoying at times. But even this does little to make them full blown annoying characters. Even Hou-oh, who I mentioned briefly earlier as acting out of random uncharacteristic impulse, turned out to be one of my favorite anime side characters in a long time. Basically what I'm trying to say is that the characters have minor annoying tendencies, but the core that makes them who they are is solid, and will keep you invested in them. \\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMemorable dialogue? Check. Fun scenarios? Check. Colorful characters? Check. Fulfilling story? Check. Top-notch pacing? Check. Meaningful fight scenes? Check. A spattering of fan service here and there? Ding Ding Ding. We have a winner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIts not the greatest show I've ever seen. But it's definitely worth the watch. I honestly believe it would be rated a lot higher if people weren't so upset with the ending. To cure that, I've decided to write an explanation. So if you haven't yet finished the show, PLEASE STOP READING HERE. If you have finished the 12 episode series, here's my take on what the ending was about...\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: Light Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari (or Story of the Sword), taken as a whole, is about the falsification and course-correction of history. So it only makes sense that the first question we should ask is what part of history was corrected and what part was falsified?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with what was falsified. The subject matter behind this story is China, not Japan. And Shichika is an anime-parallel of Jing Ke. Name sound familiar? If so, either you're a history buff or you've watched too many Jet Li movies. Jing Ke, as some of you may know, is the main character of the 2002 Jet Li movie, \"Hero\" (although in the movie, he's known as \"nameless\"). And the history that is course-corrected is Jing Ke failed assassination of Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, and the man who would later become China's first Emperor. (the name Shichika in Japanese means \"seven,\" which could refer to the seven warring nations of Han before they were united under Ying Zheng) He's also the one who ordered the eventual construction of the great wall of China to fend China off from foreign invaders, which the anime briefly mentions. The legend goes, Jing Ke earned an audience with Zheng upon presenting him with a present - the 12 broken swords of his greatest enemies. But in the end, Jing Ke failed because of two critical mistakes. First, he was paralyzed with fear for both himself and his loved ones at the sight of the King, and second, he was too slow in retrieving the poisoned dagger he hid in the scroll he presented to the King.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the stage is set, let's move on to course-correction. While it's true that Emperor Zheng built the great wall, he was actually hated in China. The construction of the great wall cost the lives of millions, and Zheng was remembered as being a ruthless coward. And so peering into the future, Kiki Shikizaki (and his descendant Princess Hitei) attempted to course-correct Jing Ke's failed assassination by getting rid of his two weaknesses - his human heart, and his need of a weapon. And so he taught Ke's ancestor the Kyotouryuu and created the deviant blades as a condition precedent for Ke's meeting with Zheng. Lastly, by killing Togame, the love of his life (who's name in Japanese means \"Blame\" as in the one to blame for countless deaths), Princess Hitei fulfilled her ancestor's goal in getting rid of Jing Ke's second weakness, and turning him into a perfected weapon, without residual attachment to the world. This allowed him to overcome his fears, and even go as far as to wish for death. And so all the blood shed would not be in vain and millions of lives are saved from the clutches of China's first tyrant. Of course, this would mean that Zheng could no longer build the great wall to protect China from invaders, to which Shichika replies (and I'm paraphrasing) - we'll just have to trust the heroes of the future to tear them to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so that should explain what happened. I may be wrong, but at the very least, it gives you a basis for understanding the theme of this story. By focusing on what could have happened (history), rather than what did happen (anime), the ending should hold a bit more weight. The story doesn't do that, it really couldn't. That was something that had to be left to the viewer. Another thing that probably upset people is how Shichika ends up with Hitei. Well, that's something you have to look at in context of the overarching theme of the anime - the falsification of history. History is written by the victor. Now ask yourself who you think the narrator of the story is. It could only be one person. And once you've figured that out, things should become clearer. History is written by the victor, and in this case a victor with a penchant for falsifying history. Is it not possible that the ending was a lie too? Call it a narrator's wishful thinking, if you must. Hopefully, you were able to figure out what I meant. I can't solve all your riddles for you. It would take too long. And by then, I will have already torn you all to pieces. Cheerio!",

            "content": "I simply cannot grasp why this anime receives so much praise.\r\nSPOILER-FREE\r\nWhite Fox adapted this from the light novel Katanagatari, and although they have the same author and a similar name, it has no connection to the Monogatari series in style, substance or story. The two main characters romp through a mythologized version of feudal Japan, neatly divided into formulaic episodes, collecting swords and killing fucking everyone they see.\r\nKatanagatari is by no means a terrible anime, but if you look at the way it is treated, you might think it\u2019s an absolute masterpiece, or panders to the shounen crowd excessively. Neither is true. The world andaction are so ridiculous and clich\u00e9d that you might be forgiven for thinking it is simply a parody. If Katanagatari deserves any praise (which indeed it does), it is for managing a certain level of uniqueness. However, uniqueness alone is not enough to carry a series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a twelve episode anime about collecting twelve swords. As such, you may begin to notice a pattern that the anime follows. In case you can\u2019t I can spell it out for you: find the sword, find the wielder of the sword, get ready to kill sword wielder, fight scene, kill sword wielder, take sword. Fortunately, Katanagatari is not so obtuse as to staunchly follow this formula for every episode, but it can get pretty tedious at times; sometimes the biggest surprise an episode will shock you with is how few people die.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, none of the characters have any qualms about killing even friendly characters, resulting in one of the highest body counts per episode I\u2019ve seen in anime. Not that it is necessarily a bad thing, but Katanagatari just makes it annoying; out of a cast of dozens of characters, you can count on one hand those alive at the end. There is even a set of twelve characters who exist for no purpose other than dying violent deaths as soon as they\u2019ve received their quota of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThis \u201cquota of characterization\u201d brings me to another annoying habit of this show: a naruto-esqe need to explain every technique and move of every character. Announcing attacks beforehand already makes the action scenes a little silly, and very few characters indeed do not at least once give a lecture on their fighting style, magical moves or weapons, usually in the middle of a fight. This highlights the more prevalent flaw of excessive dialogue. For an \u201caction\u201d show there is not nearly enough action. A lot of this does contribute to the story and characters, but some of it makes me wonder if it wasn\u2019t just to fill up their 50 minute time slot.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the ending deserves special attention. Jarring would be an understatement, a better description would be \u201cfeels like it\u2019s from a different show.\u201d All of the characters in the final episode have their personalities nearly reversed, and events transpire that makes the rest of the series relatively meaningless. It feels terribly contrived and without spoiling too much, it is a massive disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is unique. Opinions on the character designs will be very subjective; they are certainly atypical of anime. Over the course of the series they will likely grow on the viewers. Backgrounds are colorful and charming. The art really does not fit the story and setting but some will love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe real weakness of this show\u2019s art is the animation. It starts out passable, but as it goes on you can almost see a counter on the screen as White Fox\u2019s budget for this show drops. Fight scenes are the only part that gets any special attention as the show goes on, and even their quality drops over time. It starts out fairly pretty but increases in still frames, simple designs and reused animation become more obvious. If I did not know they spent a month on each episode I would say it looks rushed. Overall this extreme inconsistency leads to some parts looking quite attractive and others looking really awful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Katanagatari is pretty lackluster, but often fits very well with the show. The music definitely contributes to the mood of scenes. The voice actors complement the show far worse. Tamura Yukari does a brilliant job as Togame. Unfortunately other characters generally deliver their lines with all the emotion of reading a string of numbers with a director over their shoulder shouting \u201csound angry for this scene!\u201d The sound effects really shine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the point of Katanagatari. Whether you like the show are not, everyone will agree that the action, story and everything else are secondary to the character development. Unfortunately, this means the show puts incredible effort into one area that ultimately falls flat on its face. The only good thing I can say about the characters is they are not stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are particularly unimpressive. They are incredibly shallow and most are killed off as soon as they receive just enough development to elicit an emotional reaction from the lowest common denominator. I also can't count the number of \"Japan's strongest\" that come out of the woodwork.\\n\\n\r\nTogame, Shichika and their relationship are the real focus of the show. Throughout the show they slowly develop from a largely superficial relationship into one of real trust between partners. Finally, at nobody\u2019s surprise, romantic love blossoms between the two. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding this make it unsatisfactory. And it happens during the final episode, which I have mentioned involves everyone acting tremendously out of character.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough their interactions are very strong, Togame and Shichika themselves are rather weak characters. Shichika especially is quite the Gary Stu, with a lot of forced development. \u201cWhy does he fall for Togame in minutes?\u201d Because he does. \u201cWhy does he suddenly get way stronger?\u201d Because he does. \u201cWhy is he unable to use a sword?\u201d Because it makes a convenient plot device. This sort of thing is constant.\\n\\n\r\nOne last problem that bugs me particularly is that Katanagatari succumbs to temptation and commits one of the cardinal sins of anime character development: \u201ccHAIRacter development.\u201d This is changing hair style, especially cutting a female\u2019s hair short, to demonstrate character development. It is usually done when the character is so weak that a superficial change is required to show growth. It was completely unnecessary and just annoying.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t hard to get caught up in Katanagatari. If you can overlook some flaws then there isn\u2019t any reason you can\u2019t enjoy watching it. The ending is lousy, but the ride to get there can be pretty fun at times.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and focus on characters make this show unique, but uneven animation, disappointing characters and the ending cause this show to fail at being what it wanted so desperately to be: special.",

            "content": "What do you fight for?  That is a question with no simple answer. People say that they wish to accomplish some sort of dream or aspiration. To achieve fame, fortune, love, or maybe even revenge.  Some are simple and others ambitious beyond belief.  The real question is, do you have the will to fulfill that dream?  Is it truly what you wish for? Are willing to struggle to the end for it? Many people try to fulfill their aspirations. Many people simply die in regret and are forgotten.  Others fulfill a dream so large they are remembered for all time.To explore this question is the main purpose of the work \u201cKatanagatari\u201d. Now ask yourself \u201cwhat will your dying words be?\u201d Words to be remembered? Or words of regret?\\n\\n\r\nPremise Synopsis** (review is after)\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is about Yasuri Shichika, a young man in his twenties who has lived with his father and sister on a small island in exile. After the death of his father one year before the show began Shichika inherits the title of the family head. This comes with the secrets of the sword less sword style which is dubbed \u201cKyotouryuu\u201d.  This is an anti-sword martial art that uses the body to disarm and break the opponent\u2019s weapons. To the Yasuri family their life and body is nothing but a sword. This is why they are dubbed the swordsmen without swords.  Insert Togame, the self proclaim strategian of the Shogun.  She comes to the island of the Yasuri hoping to enlist the help of Shichika\u2019s father. She instead enlists him as he is the new family head. Then she  states has a quest to find the 12 deviant blades of the legendary sword smith Shikizaki Kiki. These blades are so powerful and valuable that they can change the course of history itself. The Shogunate has tried for years to claim even one of these blades to no avail. Togame then asks for Shichika\u2019s help.  She personally has failed numerous times to get the blades. She has used those who fought for money and those who fought for honor.  First she used those who fight for money. They simply stole the first blade and ran.  Then she tried those who fought for honor. Yet, those who fought for honor could not resist the honor of owning such a prestigious sword. She then states she needs a warrior who will fight for love.  She needs a person that is devoted to her and only her. Shichika thinking her a curious woman and wishing to be someone\u2019s \u201csword\u201d (as the family considers themselves swords) accepts the offer saying \u201cIve fallen for you\u201d. What follows is a grand journey of introspection, love and human nature that will shake you to your core.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Story) \\n\r\nKatangatri is written by Nisio Isin whose most notable work is Bakemonogatari. Katangatari is much like the former in the style of its dialog and use of symbolism/ stylized art. Katanagatari though is a much more focused story than Bakemonogatari.  Katanagatari is told in 12; 50 minute episodes. Each episode of Katanagatari has Shickika and Togame going after one of the 12 deviant blades. These episodes aired once a month during 2010 from January to December. In the show the seasons changed in correlation with this.  It also takes them 1 month to get each blade making it move in time with the real world. This creates a feeling of connection with the journey.  Every episode Togame and Shichika meet a new person with one of the blades. Shichika having no knowledge of the world learns something new every episode and develops accordingly.  You watch through the journey as the \u201csword\u201d that is Shichika becomes human.  He starts as something without his own will, who simply listens to Togame as her \u201csword\u201d.  He then develops into a human with a will and moral compass. By the end he has his reason to fight.  It is a journey of twits and turns in a world that has change on the horizon. It\u2019s a show that will keep you guessing to the eventual outcome of each episode. Showing you that things don\u2019t always turn out the way we plan, no matter how much we wish it.  Just as you think you have it down, it catches you once more. Better yet its twists are heavily foreshadowed and don\u2019t feel like ass pulls. This journey then culminates into a final conclusion so epic and heart wrenching that it cannot be spoiled nor missed; it will \u201ctear you to pieces\u201d.  One thing to say is this show is very dialog heavy.  Its great dialog don\u2019t get me wrong, it just can be a turn off for some. But its not to say is doesn\u2019t have epic fights.  The fights are great with fluid chorography and animation. It\u2019s simply not the main focus. As far a story telling goes Katangatari is an episodic journey of the highest caliber. It is simply breathtaking in execution and conclusion. (10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\r\nThe main characters of Katanagatari are the aforementioned Togame and Sichika. The main thing keeping this show interesting during its 50 min episodes is the dialog. The banter between Togame and Shichika is clever and charming. It also makes the developing romance feel much more real to the viewer.  Each character including the 12 owners of the swords have a developed back story and a motivation to fight, some good some evil. The development for Shichika mostly comes when he kills the good and the evil owners without any remorse or caring, simply because it\u2019s Togame\u2019s will. Yet as he hears the dying words of each and the different motivations he realizes he has nothing he fights for himself. He gains his own moral code and also gains reasons for why he follows Togame. Now I shall talk about Togame.  She has many names, \u201cThe stratigen\u201d, \u201cthat unpleasant woman\u201d, and others names that would be spoiler territory. She is an energetic, manipulative, and clever woman that seeks the blades for unknown reasons that latter become clearer. Togame , like Sichika learns to love, and her moral code changes as she learns from the owners and Sichika. The Dialog, development, and generally script writing in Katangatari is top noch. The only gripe I have is some of the more important villains (who shunt be named) had too little back-story to them. It was hard to understand the final motivation for the final owners (can\u2019t get into detail\u2026 spoilers). Yet the dialog and characters are an overall crowing achievement. \\n\r\n(9/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Art)\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a stylized symbolic adventure with art that looks like it comes from an old legend.  The animations during the fights are one of the many high points in the series. They are well choreographed and fluid. The character designs and weapon designs are well handled and animated. Each owner has an interesting design. Animation was handled by Studio \u201cWhite Fox\u201d who are a subsidiary of OLM Inc. They are a very new studio whose first work was in 2009 and Katangatari (2010) being their second work ever. The most notable thing they have animated was the widely popular Steins;Gate anime. It\u2019s symbolic, light art style that can instantly turn dark complements the show perfectly.  It is not without flaws. The art does have a few glitches here and there. I did stop and notice some errors in animation during many of the dialog sequences. Yet the fluid motion and dynamic animation at most points make up for its occasional errors. \\n\r\n(9/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Katanagatari is very\u2026 interesting.  It utilizes rap in a mix of Japanese and English under a back score of traditional Japanese music. It can sound epic as it wants to and does a very good job of doing so. What surprised me was that it could also sound beautiful.  To be compared it shares a similar musical style to the Samurai Champloo sound track.  The rap in Champloo was handled by Najubes, while Katangatari\u2019s rap and vocals is handled by an artist called Lotus juice. The overall composition was handled by Taku Iwasaki who also handled Tegen Toppa Guerren Lagan and JoJo\u2019s Bizzare adventure (part 2) sound tracks. The original Op\u2019s and Ed\u2019s are good, just not amazing. YET, Katanagatari received a new op for its 2013 rerun which is possibly on of the greatest anime openings I\u2019ve ever heard. I say this because of how well it fits in with the show. The song itself and the visuals are amazing. The Ost choice is easily this opening. It is done by the band \u201cSupercell\u201d titled \u201cHakushi Kassai Utaawase\u201d. This is for the aforementioned reasons. The sound track overall is good, some tracks stand out and others aren\u2019t noticed much. Better than most and serves its overall purpose. \\n\r\n(8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment)\\n\r\nTo state I simply \u201cenjoyed\u201d this work would be a slight understatement. It has firmly entrenched itself into my favorites list and my soul.   Katanagatari is a grand episodic journey of introspection and human nature. Throw in a good sound track, great dialog, and tons of great moments.  You got yourself some great enjoyment. Truly this was an excellent use of 12 hours. \\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Verdict)\\n\r\nKatanagatari is one of those diamonds in the rough. It starts as a simple journey, but turns out to be so much more. A quest for 12 swords over 12 months, the turning  of a \u201csword\u201d into a human being with thoughts and wants. It\u2019s a show who\u2019s art, sound, and setting work together to lead up to one of the grandest conclusions in anime history.  It leaves you with a feeling of loss and the questions of, \u201cwhat do you fight for?\u201d Money? Power? Your own dream? Or the one you love?  Do you have the will to do it? What will your dying words be?  Will they be that of regret? Or words to be remembered?  No matter which they all end in death. With that on this evening and month I polity close the curtain on this review.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score Katanagatari: \\n\r\n(9.45)\\n\\n\r\n-Raptor\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is interesting because it's one of the better anime in recent time (that I have seen), one of the best anime from 2010 (that I have seen) and arguably the best work of NisiOisiN (that I have seen, even though this only includes two titles).\r\nNow, Katanagatari is great, it's absolutely wonderful, but depending on your ability to immerse yourself in a story so much that you forget time this may or may not be for you. If you are like me with the attention span of a goldfish, initially the 50-minute long episodes might scare you off. If you are able to put upwith it, however, you are in for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nI will not summarise the series because frankly you can look at the anime description for that, that and I doubt I will make it that much more interesting. I will just go through why I like it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all there are the characters, which I think are the main driving force behind this anime. They bounce off each other really well, providing good (but not ROFLOL hilarious) comedy and creating an overall likable character dynamic. The side characters are also fairly good, they do their thing, but for the most part you will not see them for more than one episode, so they do not matter too much. I will also give points to the incredibly forced romance. I like that Katanagatari doesn't even try to build it up naturally but instead approaches it like \"Yeah, we're in love even though we've shared a whole of five miniutes of screen time. Deal with it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are short but very energetic and well directed. While they are very good, be warned if you are going into Katana thinking it wll be 90% action; it will not. In fact, much of the anime is spent on dialogue. Think Bakemonogatari, just not quite the same bullet pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is excellent, and while I do not think it stands out per se the music tracks are used very efficiently, creating just the right mood every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be descriped as fairly minimalistic - it certainly does not stand out in terms of production values - but it gets its job done and does it well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari is gud, you should definitely check it out if you like dialogue and good action scenes, but due to the length of the episodes you may or may not be able to marathon through it. Also: dat last episode.",

            "content": "What is it that you fight for? Money? Power? Honor? Love? Revenge? Out of all the millions of reasons , in the end does it really matter? These are some of the things you will ponder while watching Katanagatari. Nisio Isin, the mind behind the monogatari-series, which some might call a twist on the harem genre, has used his deft hand at creating unique characters and worlds, in what would traditionally be a shounen premise. The end result, is a masterfully crafted tale that blends Japanese folklore, romance, and martial arts with a very contemporary touch that makes Katanagatari feel both modern and old atthe same time. Simply put it, Katanagatari is a story of both the ages, and the here and now. It is a wonderfully crafted tale that I had the pleasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9/10)- Katanagatari's premise is essentially the typical shounen premise. Yasuri Shichika, master of the swordless sword style, Kyotouryuu, lives on an island with his older sister, Nanami. They know nothing of what life is like in the outside world, until one day an intruder interrupts the tranquility of their island. Togame, a self-proclaimed strategian, enlists the help of Shichikia to acquire the 12 deviant blades for the shogunate. In any one elses hands, Katanagatari would've been ridden with cliches and tropes found in many popular shounen anime/manga. However, Katanagatari is anything but typical.\\n\\n\r\nIn all of Nisio Isin's works, dialogue is always at the forefront. Katanagatari is no different, it is probably even more so since each episode is a whomping 50 minutes long. But that is exactly where the show succeeds, in it's dialogue. The dialogue is witty, clever, intelligent and insightful. All without being verbose and mundane. The conversations often provide background and motivations for characters and do a phenomenal job at world building, bringing the world and characters to life while giving it a touch of realism.That is not to say the plot itself isn't interesting either. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, there are a lot of unforeseen twists and turns that serve to deepen the plot without being convoluted or contrived. All the plot points are revealed at the right time to cause the greatest impact on the viewer. It is not this often that a story is able to hit all the right notes.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)- The art for Katanagatari is nothing short of beautiful. It has a very vibrant color scheme that your screen will be glowing the entire time. The character designs are a bit atypical because they seem more.....cartoonish. They aren't overly detailed but aren't so base that you can't remember what they look like. The backgrounds are detailed to that point where the world itself becomes a character.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)- The soundtrack is nothing short of memorable. It is composed by Iwasaki Taku who is famous for his work on Rurouni Kenshin Trust and Betrayal, Now and Then Here and There. The soundtrack is a unique blend of jazz, Indian flutes, and traditional pieces that compliment the world adding to its character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)- By far, the best thing about Katanagatari is the relationship between Shichika and Togame; how their relationship grows and how they mature throughout the story. Shichika starts out as a bland individual. He lacks any traits, besides his strength, that cause him to stand out. He is essentially a living weapon. Each encounter he has with an enemy, leaves a lasting impression on him, causing him to change little by little. Throughout the show, you see him make the transition from a mere weapon, to a human being. You feel as though you are changing with him. \\n\\n\r\nThe encounters not only change the characters themselves, but also serves to deepen their relationship. With each encounter Shichika has with an enemy, it adds another dimension to his relationship with Togame. He starts out as merely a tool for her to use, but slowly she grows to love Shichika. The same for Shichika as well. He follows Togame blindly without any reason but over time he finds a reason to fight. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains are not mere caricatures either. Due to the length of the episodes, the villains are fleshed out to the point where they are human. They each have their own reasons for pursuing the deviant blade, along with a distinct personality and world view. It is rare that a show gives development to almost every character in the cast, in a seemingly short time frame.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion(9/10)- Katanagatari is a tale both grand in ambition and in scope. It is one of the view anime that accomplishes what it wants to without compromises. A stong narrative, and strong lead characters put it head and shoulders above nearly every anime out there. If you have the patience to withstand the lengthy conversations, the pay off is well worth it. I give Katanagatari 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Cheerio! \\n",

            "content": "Considering the amount of love this show has received, it feels risky giving a comparatively low score to Katanagatari, although I don't personally consider a 7 by any means low. Please don't label this review as \"not helpful\" just because you disagree with the scores or think they are too low. This is a difficult show to review because a) most of my complaints are directed to the plot and character development, both of which are difficult to describe without spoilers, and b) some of the complaints can also be considered reasons why this show is amazing or unique. Unique is indeed one of thebetter ways to describe Katanagatari, but let us get into the review.\\n\\n\r\n*STORY -- 5 -- MEDIOCRE*\\n\r\nAgain, it is difficult to explain the score without specifics, but the best way I can describe this show's plot is that it is both far too predictable, and far too unpredictable. The show's structure is essentially as follows: each episode takes place a month apart and features the two protagonists, Yasuri Shichika and Togame, locating one of the twelve legendary swords and obtaining it in one way or another. Having a show running on a formula such as this runs the risk of killing the show's unpredictability, since the plot is literally formulaic. You KNOW that the protagonists are going to succeed and take the sword that episode. This makes some of the more drawn-out segments that rely on suspense fall somewhat flat, since you already know the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps in an effort to counter this predictability, the show throws many moments that seemingly come completely out of nowhere, but rather than feeling excitingly unexpected, these moments often feel cheap or underdeveloped. There is often a lack of proper build-up to many of the show's twists or turns, making the viewer feel cheated or downright confused. There are the occasional moments where this unexpectedness works extremely well, particularly in episode 4, although that episode in particular highlights an issue regarding the anime's characters which I cannot explain without spoiling it (basically, it highlights how uninteresting the two protagonists are). Unfortunately, these better moments are few and far between. The last few episodes in particular, while praised as some of the best in anime by some, feel particularly prone to random new plot threads that the show expects its audience to accept. \"AHA SURPRISE! THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE PLAN ALL ALONG!\" is not a good plot device, nor is having one of the characters go around performing unexplainably overpowered deeds and him simply explaining it by saying \"It is not necessary for you to understand what just happened.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show is definitely inconsistent in its quality. Certain episodes are actually quite excellent and well-paced. Others are downright awful and are entirely exposition where the protagonist goes on some mind-bending LSD adventure in an effort to get him to understand something of great importance -- a common trope in anime. The quality of the episode seems very much related to the characters featured, so I will touch on that later.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's focus seems to be on its dialogue, which is mostly a good call, since the interactions between characters are the show's strongest moments. However, it often feels that the show's writers know that the dialogue is good, and decide to take it too far. As a result, many of the dialogue scenes drag horribly with seemingly no reason but to fill time or show off. The pacing definitely could have used a bit of work.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the dialogue is generally excellently written, the actual writing of the show is surprisingly poor. If that's confusing, let me try to explain by saying that the show has a tendency to tell rather than show, which is not a good writing strategy. Sometimes a character may be telling something rather well, but that doesn't negate the fact that they shouldn't be telling it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show's unpredictability and copious amounts of dialogue can be used as examples of why Katanagatari is unique and therefore deserves praise. Although aspects are certainly unique, it still feels very much like a typical anime at most times. Even when the show manages to be unique, a show needs to be more than just that -- it actually has to be well executed. I simply cannot call Katanagatari's story well executed despite its attempts to be different.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTER -- 6 -- FAIR*\\n\r\nThe characters are what manage to save the show's content from disaster, although they are very far from being excellent. The protagonists in particular are a great target of criticism. Togame's character is overall extremely static. She hardly changes, aside from her feelings and attitude towards Shichika. This wouldn't be a huge issue on its own were her character not so stock and boring. She is the stereotypical high-tempered, jealous, easily embarrassed, pouty female trying to make a name for herself but unable to alone because she is essentially incompetent. She definitely improves in the competency department later on, making some successful strategies, but she is a far cry from being interesting or unique. Some of her backstory is better than her actual character, but suffers from the plot's problem of throwing sudden, unexpected globs of information at the audience and expecting you to care.\\n\\n\r\nShichika is the other protagonist and his \"development\" in particular bothers me. He displays the guise of having tremendous character development, changing from being a completely blank person -- literally a tool (sword, in this case) -- to a caring human being. He can best be described as a robot learning he has feelings. Unfortunately, it is not impressive character development to go from nothing to a human being. What IS impressive character development is to go from a human being to an INTERESTING human being, which Shichika never becomes. He essentially manages to become a normal stock character, which almost makes him less interesting than how he starts out as. At least when he is nothing but a tool, he has that unique aspect of having no idea about human emotions or the outside world, which is played off for humour decently well. He does display the odd quirky moment, and you can only wish there were more of such glimmers of personality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat, then, manages to save this show? That would be some of its secondary characters -- namely, those who wield the swords the protagonists must obtain. These characters are certainly not all great (one character in an episode in Ezo in particular was simply terribly developed, or rather, wasn't at all), but a few of them bring you into their world and make you care about their fates. This is extremely effective and is one of the ways the show's predictability is somewhat mitigated. By knowing that these swordsmen are going to lose, the episode becomes something of a tragedy, as you realize this world they have developed and rely on the sword to maintain are going to be destroyed by the two protagonists. As such, episodes that feature the most interesting swordsmen are also the best episodes. Unfortunately, only a few of these swordsmen end up being this interesting, so the praise can only really apply to a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Maniwa Corps, a ninja corps that appears throughout the entire show, is a particularly strange presence. Without spoiling too much, their appearance in each episode eventually becomes something of a running gag that I personally found quite humorous. This could probably be a criticism, and in a way it is, because these characters are woefully underdeveloped, but in this case, that actually feels intentional and in a way that doesn't feel contrived or cheap. Still, they certainly could have done without them entirely for the most part, which probably isn't the best sort of characters to have.\\n\\n\r\nNanami, Shichika's sister, is probably the worst-written character in the entire show in my opinion, which is an incredible shame because she starts off as potentially one of the most interesting. She makes an appearance early on that completely steals the episode in a surprising way, which is one of the show's best moments, but the next time she is featured, her character is so poorly and suddenly developed and the episode's contents are so messily executed that I would probably consider said episode the worst in the series. They eventually explain what happens at the end of the episode, but by that point, the damage has already been done.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a massive host of other characters, namely a couple that appear in the latter stages of the journey, many of which are also underdeveloped. There are simply too many characters for this show to handle in its time frame, which is a shame, because all of the voice performances are generally excellent.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*ART -- 9 -- GREAT*\\n\r\nThis show's art is by far its strongest aspect. The production in general is fantastic, with a unique art style that, while not personally my favourite, has moments of startling beauty and a sort of painting-like quality that makes many frames feel like classic Japanese art. Some of the character designs are a bit questionable, but overall, the art is superb. Unfortunately, there is one episode in the middle of the series where the art style completely changes, and while I can't comment on any possible artistic reasoning, all I can say is that the episode feels like it was produced on a budget. Whether this is true or not, I have no idea, but there is noticeably less movement and quality in the art, which is a shame, since this episode is particularly important plot-wise.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to give the best aspect of the show such a short piece of the review, but aside from that one episode mentioned, there isn't much to say aside from the art being excellent.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SOUND -- 8 -- VERY GOOD*\\n\r\nThe sound is not as stand-out as the art but still good. There is some good music, although nothing in particular really stands out. The sound effects are also fine, but again, nothing outstanding. As mentioned, the voice performances are fantastic, which gives a great boost to the sound's score. Because the rest of the sound is otherwise rather average, I can't give it higher than an 8, but it is still quite good nonetheless. I do have one huge nitpick regarding the sound design: there are on occasion songs placed into the background, and the lyrics often clash with the atmosphere of the scene or appear underneath dialogue. This gives this weird feeling where you hear voices but don't understand where they are coming from until you realize they are in the background music. A mostly minor complaint, but it practically ruined one or two scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*ENJOYMENT -- 7 -- GOOD*\\n\r\nThis was one of those shows that rarely gripped me, but also never got bad enough to make me stop watching. It was mildly entertaining throughout, with some fantastic moments sprinkled in with some maddeningly poor ones, but even those poor moments helped keep me watching if only out of outrage, so perhaps they were doing something right. This wasn't a show I ever felt like dropping, nor was it a show I couldn't wait to watch the next episode of.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL -- 7 -- GOOD*\\n\r\nConsidering how badly I bashed the story and many of the characters, even a 7 may sound surprisingly high, but the production values really go a long way in elevating the show's quality. Even the story and characters, while highly flawed, are serviceable enough to be enjoyable. Perhaps the best way to describe Katanagatari is as an aspiring epic crammed into far too short a time span. The anime simply tries to tackle far more than it can handle, from too much dialogue to too many characters to too many new subplots to too many unexpected twists. The show definitely could have benefitted from either being longer or trimming its excess fat. Being longer would perhaps give those poorly-developed, unexpected moments a great chance to become legitimately believable or well-built-up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these plentiful criticisms, Katanagatari is an above-average show. It is beautiful, has some excellent moments, and is generally entertaining. You could certainly do better, and it isn't the masterpiece some herald it to be, but you could also certainly do much worse.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWhat\u2019s more important: the destination, or the journey it takes to get there? If you put every ounce of your blood, sweat and tears towards achieving your goal, and still fail, was it all for nothing? Inversely, if you accomplish all of your goals without breaking a sweat, are you really accomplishing anything? Due to the fact that the outcome of nearly every shounen anime every made is never in any real question what so ever, this is not a theme we have ever seen explored in anime. At least, not until Katanagatari was released. This anime is perhaps the only show evermade that can justifiably be called a proper deconstruction of the modern shounen; it takes the aspects and clich\u00e9s that you would ordinarily assume about a narrative and promptly beats you over the head with them. It examines the inner workings and conceptual concepts of the genre and makes you completely rethink the priorities of storytelling. As if that weren\u2019t enough, it also proceeds to accomplish all of this without sacrificing an ounce of entertainment, comedy, action, wit, pacing, or essentially anything. This anim- \u2026no\u2026 This MASTERPIECE deserves a hell of a lot more credit than it gets, even if it isn\u2019t perfect. Presenting one of my all time favorites: Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\n Synopsis: Yasuri Shichika, the 7th successor of the Kyoto Ryu style sword art, lives on an isolated island with his older sister, Nanami; he has never had any other human contact. One day, the island is visited by a woman named Togame, who requests his aid in her quest to find and collect the twelve legendary swords forged by the master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki. And thus, the \u201cSword Story\u201d begins.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Katanagatari\u2019s storyline is nothing special. In fact, in may take you quite a few glances to realize that there is more to this simple \u201cSword Story\u201d than you are made to initially think. Largely episodic in nature, each episode consists of Shichika and Togame locating and obtaining one of the 12 swords. Conveniently, there are 12 episodes in the show (each of them twice as long as a normal anime episode, doing wonders for the pacing of the anime). Now, that information alone might make you assume quite a few things. However, you\u2019re going to want to take my advice: Don\u2019t. Katanagatari teaches you relatively early on that you should not assume a single thing about it. It is NOT an average shounen. Episode 4, perhaps the most trolltastic anime episode ever aired, is more than enough to demonstrate this. This show doesn\u2019t just avoid its genre\u2019s traditional tropes, it laughs in the face of them. It completely dismantles what an average plot might consider to be important and demonstrates the things that are REALLY important when you are telling a story: Character development, motivations, pacing, engaging dialogue, and much more. It\u2019s genius. Pure and utter genius. Katanagatari makes fun of or completely deconstructs an uncountable number of clich\u00e9s, and yet it always does so with the most impeccable sense of execution and taste. Ah, but I\u2019ll stop clumsily trying to discuss the show\u2019s themes while attempting to avoid spoilers. Let\u2019s get to the other aspects of the storyline:\\n\\n\r\nSomething you will initially notice about this anime is that is has a LOT of dialogue. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is certainly a very fair share of action, but the majority of the screen time is spent showing the characters having conversations with one another. The reason that this is a good thing is because it\u2019s VERY well written dialogue; sometimes hilarious, sometimes deep, but always witty and/or thoughtful. One of the best scripts I\u2019ve ever seen. The emotional highs are high, the emotional lows are low, the comedic timing is flawless when applicable, and the show always seems to know just what to say. Katanagatari covers the entire range of the emotional spectrum; it will make you feel EVERY emotion. I can\u2019t say the same thing for any other anime I\u2019ve ever watched, or at least not to the same extent. The one and only complaint I can make about the storyline is that it gets a bit lax when fleshing out its plot developments toward the end, but none of it really matters in the end. Did I mention that this series has, quite possibly, the greatest final episode in anime history? Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know how to write good characters, look no further than Katanagarari\u2019s incredibly memorable, masterfully written and downright lovable cast. Y\u2019know how Cowboy Bebop became wildly popular because of its ability to introduce new characters every episode and still end the episode arc with them feeling fully fleshed out (among other things)? Well, Katanagatari does it even better. From compelling backstories to unique personalities to complex motivations, the side characters in this show are among the greatest and most interesting in the entire medium considering the circumstances. However, even without them, the character cast would be totally unforgettable thanks to the duo of Shichika and Togame; both of whom are some of my favorite characters of all time. Shichika, besides being likable, is one of the finest examples of character development I\u2019ve ever seen. His thoughts and actions carry unfathomable thematic weight and his personality is unique as well as perfect for the tone of show. Did I mention that he is also a badass? Shichika is quite possibly my favorite anime character of all time; he was written so goddamn well that it\u2019s inspiring. Togame is just as complex as Shichika, but her motives are shrouded in mystery. Really, before anything else, Togame should be lauded for being one of the most likeable characters ever conceived. She is laugh out loud hilarious, full of energy, absurdly adorable, and STILL manages to command the respect of the viewer and be legitimately multi-facetted. Really, I struggle to find the words to do this pair justice. Easily the highlight to an already incredible show, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned that the character designs are astonishingly awesome; easily my all time favorite. What a stupendous job by the writers in this department. The characters stand out as the best part of an already amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nSome people really like the art style of Katanagatari while others dislike it, but I never understood how anyone could possible not think this show looks good. The bold colors and lines are pure eye candy, and I\u2019ve already mentioned that the character designs are the most beautiful, diverse, and creative examples in the industry. The action scenes are animated wonderfully and even the dialogue scenes never seem to lack energy. I LOVED the animation for this show, even though some people disagree for whatever reason. There is much less debate about the music and voice-acting, however, which are both nearly flawless in execution. Katanagatari has maybe the best and most varied original score I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. From haunting and intense melodies with a traditional Japanese theme to the occasional hip-hop track that gives even the likes of Samurai Champloo a run for its money to everything in between, believe me when I say that this soundtrack has it all. The two OPs really aren\u2019t anything special, but Katanagatari re-aired on television in 2013 with a brand new OP, and THAT one is fucking incredible. Probably the most underrated OP of all time, and one of my personal favorites. When it comes to presentation, I struggle to find a single thing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to end this review with a clich\u00e9 (ironically), but I\u2019m going to anyway: This anime will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel every emotion in between. It\u2019s intelligent and has tons of depth while being simultaneously entertaining and filled to the brim with charm. If you don't watch Katanagatari, you are doing yourself a major disservice. I highly doubt that there will ever be another anime that manages to balance themes and entertainment as well as this series; it\u2019s one of a kind. Not bad for a Sword Story.",

            "content": "Katanagatari started as a light novel series by Isin Nisio. Who's written nothing else that I'm familiar with. He wrote some novelizations for both Death Note and xxxHolic, but I'm only familiar with the originals for those two and novels based on established series tend to vary a lot in quality. The anime adaptation was handled by the relatively new White Fox studio. They were behind both the Jormungand and Steins;Gate anime, so that could be a good sign. Then again, every studio tends to do some good and some bad work so this could be the first anime they've done that I dislike. Onlyone way to find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a martial artist, who incorrectly refers to himself as a swordsman because this anime doesn't know what a sword is*, named Shichika. He lives with his sister in exile on an island. That ends when a woman named Togame shows up and asks Shichika to accompany her on a journey to collect twelve deviant blades. He agrees because he's fallen in love with her for no adequately explained reason. Did I mention he knows her for all of thirty minutes at that point? The story follows their journey to wade through a massive sea of exposition in order to collect the blades. This anime breaks the most important rule of story telling, show, don't tell. There's very little that happens with any bearing on the actual plot. The episodes are roughly fifty minutes long with most episodes using three minutes for the themes, eight minutes for action sequences, five minutes for plot relevant content and thirty four minutes for long stretches of exposition. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that one episode has a twenty minute stretch of dialogue that's nothing but the characters expositing over plot points. Because... showing the information in a natural way would've taken too long? One of the most inexcusable scenes happens in the middle of a fight scene. The characters just stop for more than five minutes so that one can exposit about her backstory. Then there's the narrator, whose only purpose is to waste time by telling you where they are, which they invariably mention in their exposition anyway, or to spoil what's going to happen in the next episode thereby killing any tension before it even has a chance to build. Smooth. The only real exception is the last episode, which spends most of its time with action sequences and a scene where someone, I won't spoil who, dies for fourteen and a half minutes. The worst part is that there's someone around who could've tied a tourniquet or something but prefers to spend the time crying because the first character is bleeding to death. Because.. death is more tragic if there's someone guilty of criminal negligence. The biggest issue that comes out of the whole thing is that it's boring. Stretches of dialogue can be interesting, but they barely have any actual dialogue. Most of it is incredibly stilted exposition, which isn't interesting. Then there's the romance, which never evolves beyond an attraction that comes out of nowhere. Nothing interesting is ever done with it, rather like the anime as a whole. The attempted comedy is so lacking in actual humour that it can be difficult to tell whether something is supposed to be a joke or it's just stupid. Then there's the ending, which features an anti-climax followed by abject stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the characters. First you have Shichika himself, who calls himself a sword because he formed a club with Gundam 00's Setsuna for people who think they're inanimate objects. He has very little in terms of personality. He's pretty much defined by being stupid, hitting things and falling for random strangers. He's your typical big dumb hero character. Then you've got Togame, one of those characters who's supposed to be clever but never acts clever or demonstrates any intelligence whatsoever. She can be recognised by yelling a lot, falling over, blushing and hitting Shichika while yelling \"cheerio.\" She's a pretty typical tsundere character, except with fewer dimensions. There aren't any interesting characters in this. They just fill their role, spout exposition and then stay stagnant or die. The worst part of it is that they try to have tragic moments, but they've never given you any reason to care about any of the characters so they just fail. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the art. I actually have a few positive things to say about it. The first is that there are some really nicely drawn backgrounds. The second is that the weapons, whether they're actually swords or not, are nicely designed, mostly. Now back to giving discredit where discredit is due. The character designs in this are horrible. The eyes are just off and convey no emotion other than dull surprise, and they show up in spite of being covered by hair on several occasions. The noses appear when the characters are in profile and vanish entirely when they're shown head on. White Fox does know that noses have depth, right? The characters really do look like badly made plastic dolls. The sad thing is that they try to have fan-service by giving Togame the occasional bum shot. Yeah, this art style doesn't work for that. The animation in this is frequently lazy. There are several cases where they just hold on the same image for no reason. The fight scenes are exceptionally bad. The characters are drawn so they're almost never actually coming into contact with one another and there's one fight scene where they play the same animation three times in a row. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is another thing that I'm going to give some actual praise to. The music is well done. It could've made it in a decent anime. Then there's the voice acting. This is another anime where no one seems to be trying. I know that several of the major seiyu can act. Tamura Yukari, Tomatsu Haruka, Okiayu Ryotaro and several others are skilled at their craft but none of them seem to be putting any effort into their performances. Although, to be fair, there are very few people who could sound natural while delivering all of that exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri. \\n\\n\r\nThe final rating for Katanagatari is a 2/10. There's a pretty clear lack of effort on the parts of everyone involved. The story is mostly told through tedious exposition. Character development is absent. The fight scenes, and most of the art in general, are just poorly done and none of the seiyu seem to be trying. In the end, Katanagatari is by far the most boring anime I've ever seen and the few scenes that kind of work aren't worth sitting through the exposition for. \\n\\n\r\n* They refer to Kunai as shuriken and every weapon, from guns to an android, as swords. They even refer to some non-weapons, like a suit of armour, as swords.",

            "content": "I'm actually astounded by the huge number of people lauding Katanagatari as a masterpiece, with high rating of 9's and 10's popping off everywhere in the reviews, claiming that it is perfect/flawless blah blah blah,  listing everything positive about it then exaggerating it further. This makes it appear like it's 10/10 worthy solely from reviews when really, it's far from the truth. While Katanagatari isn't the worst out there which feels mentally violating or makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall or a sharp corner on your table, it is not on the same level as the masterpieces, which feelslike you're having an animegasm or ascending into heaven whenever you watch it. No, Katanagatari is far, far from it.\\n\\n\r\nI'll also mention some other things:\\n\\n\r\n- This is my first review on the site. Normally, I don't bother writing reviews because a lot of what I want to say about a particular anime has been already said in another. Thus, I see no reason to repeat what other people have said. It's also due to the fact that I'm lazy and it's hard to motivate myself to write one. :P\\n\\n\r\n- Characters and plot are heavily weighted.\\n\\n\r\n- Minor spoilers\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - Both 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI don't have much opinion on sound, other the opening being interesting and generally working well with the anime overall, which provides atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art I is quite unique. It's quite similar to the one you would find when you're looking at legends on screen, and indeed, Katanagatari is set during the Edo period, the reign of the Shoguns, so it's definitely good that they've used this style. The scenery is nice, though could have a bit more detail. Colours makes it look more vivid and lively most of the time, yet often dips into the darker shades as well, adding to the atmosphere already present . Characters are generally well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nThe one problem in this area though is that there has been a few cases where the art quality 'drops'. More specifically, there were cases where I've seen still frames and recycled animation used throughout the latter half of the series (often gives a shounen-esque feeling). \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the art is generally consistent throughout the show. It's good to see something new used here that's atypical of anime you see nowadays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 12/30\\n\\n\r\nOne of my first major gripe with this show, and despite it being heavily emphasised through the anime, it hasn't been executed well, regardless of the widespread acclamation that this is the show's strong point.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first failure in this case is the HUGE abundance of characters in the entire show. This isn't bad on its own. In fact, as Monster has proved, such a diversity of characters allow for fresh and interesting situation to rise, while also giving us a new perspective for the story to be told. Given that Monster also had PLENTY of time for development, it felt like each character had a purpose in the anime (Johann being somewhat of an exception, despite him being portrayed really well). Katanagatari did not have that luxury. By trying to shove such a huge cast into 12 45-minute episodes, it has inevitably shot itself on the foot, as the said character(s) don't get enough development, and as a result, are forced into 2 situations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Character feels underdeveloped, akin to one saying something like 'What's the point of this character?'\\n\r\n2. Character's development feels rushed and sudden, not gradually over time\\n\\n\r\nThe former can be said for ~95% of the entire roster. The development on the side characters, particularly the antagonists, are a joke - they barely had any time to develop before they get killed (granted, for some characters, we do see a slip of their past and how that has changed their outlook, particularly Meisai Tsuruga, who deserves some credit, but that's about it). The Maniwa Corps is the main target of the criticism here - every single character has been killed without been given a chance. A whole episode dedicated to them is not enough to be considered developemtn. I had hope for the penguin guy, seeing that he had the most potential, but nope. He dies. What a surprise. Every member of said corporation, and also a lot of the side characters, can be merely cast off with the question mentioned before, 'What's the point of this character? How is this character significant in the anime'? This is what's lacking in a lot of them. Apart from Yasuri's sister, who also received poor development and Meisai Tsuruga, I see barely any point in them. They're just a running gag in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, we get to the protagonists, Yasuri Shichiki and Togame, hailed by many for having excellent character development. Like... what? If anything, only Yasuri gets credit for 'proper' development, though it was one that could be labelled as 'expected' - a machine is expected to transform into a normal human being, in terms of developing empathy and emotion. It's nothing new here. It's uninteresting at best.\\n\\n\r\nTogame didn't really change much, considering how much screen time she had. Essentially, she was emotionally scarred due to a past trauma that left her walking down a path of veangence and looking to carry out her father's wish. As a result, to hide this fact, she puts on a 'mask', a show where she's rather expressive and reluctantly collects the 12 swords for the 'Shogun'. During her travels, she falls in love with Yasuri. However, at the end just before she died, she openly admits WITHOUT hesitation that everything she worked for was for revenge and that she planned to kill Yasuri after collecting the 12 swords (12th is a gun by the way...). Really, all she had done was that she held onto her past trauma, put on a mask and embark onto a journey to collect swords. While all this time, she did not change her mindset... Nice development... It's static.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot - 10/30\\n\\n\r\nMy second gripe with the series. Before I get into a rant, let me say that I consider Katanagatari to have 2 plots at work here that goes hand in hand: Togame collecting swords  for the shogun and the other is Yasuri developing empathy, turning from a machine into a normal human being.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the people who say that the plot is 'so complex', or so 'simple that it's so good' and give a whopping 9 or 10. Like..... No... Just no... No matter how many times I rack my brain, I can NOT understand how the plot is 'complex' as people say (and I do have an eye for subtlety if I focus). Perhaps it was the excessive dialogue that switched me off (more into this later), or perhaps my expectations quickly died out after 3 episodes feeling like a grindfest trying to finish... Only God knows.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand however, the plot being simple does not mean the plot is good. A plot being simple has to compensate in other areas, such as subtlety in thematics or in this case, characterisation. Otherwise, the whole anime suffers as a result. Due to characterisation, its saving grace, being quite lackluster, the plot was forced to suffer.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the sword collecting. While it does sound plain, lame, simple and boring, again, this isn't bad on its own. It had potential to change the direction of the narrative when needed. It had potential to add in twists and turns to keep the plot fresh. What is bad about it however, is seeing CONSTANT repetition of the following formula for 11 episodes STRAIGHT:\\n\r\nArrive at new place -> meet new antagonist -> talk -> fight (?) -> win sword\\n\r\nIt got so predictable to the point where I wasn't expecting anything new to show up. Turns out, from episode 3 onwards, up to 11, I was right. There were no twists, none of that unexpected event that puts you into a state of shock, none of that 'gamechanger'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecond, Yasuri's development. This one is more important than the sword collecting part, and where people get the idea that the plot is quite 'complex'. \\n\\n\r\nLet me say that having dialogue is fine. In fact, it's quite important, as it fills in the gaps when there's no action in the anime. It gives you an idea of what a particular character is thinking about another. It gives you an idea of their personality based on how they speak and interact with others verbally. However, there is a point where the amount of dialogue can become excessive. This has the effect of making the plot feeling like it's dragging on forever and stagnating in progress. \\n\\n\r\nThat's Katanagatari in a nutshell. There is a plethora of dialogue that shows the interaction between the 2 protagonists. Of course, with characterisation as it's focus, this was bound to happen. They needed to show how Yasuri and Tagome develop as protagonists. This, they did relatively well. You can see, through their interactions, how they change (?) throughout the course of the show. But they went over the top and added more dialogue that contributes to almost nothing. For 45 minutes. There's even dialogue in the action scenes for some reason...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdditional thoughts - 10/20\\n\\n\r\nThis section covers any additional thoughts I might have about the anime. This includes enjoyment and other comments I might make if it doesn't fit under the other major sub-topics. It also makes up the final 20 points available to bring up the total possible marks to 100.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 3 episodes, I was drawn into the anime. But the interest was lost quickly due to how repetitive the plot was and how stale it became due to the excess amount of dialogue in 45 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime listed under action, there's barely any actions and those actions aren't really well done. \\n\\n\r\nI would've expected them to choreograph the scenes in a way that looks realistic, rather than being shounen-esque in looks or slinging multiple arms around while the torso remains in 1 spot... Something like the fight scene between Lancer and Archer in ufotable's work Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL - 46/100 = 46% = 5/10 on MAL\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari, the show that loves the number 12. 12 swords, 12 ninjas, 12 episode... and I'm half expecting it to turn out that the Shichika has 12 secret techniques at his disposal. Yes, Katanagatari is an interesting show about a young man and woman on a quest to gather the 12 ultimate swords. The premise sounds fairly cliche, but still interesting enough to watch solely based on that, but how does it really fare? Lets find out...\r\nNow, let me start off by saying, if anime was judged on artistic style alone, Katanagatari would probably be one of the greatest of all time, as the artworkis beautiful. Scenic landscapes, great character design, and a whole lot else to create a beautiful vision before your eyes. The plot.. starts off on a rather simple footing, with Shichika and Togame beginning their journey, but begins to branch out wildly, creating quite a lot of sub plots. And to make things better, Katanagatari does a very nice job of keeping these plots understandable, and doesn't let itself get drowned in side stories. Every episode you can begin to enjoy the very layered plot, starting with what the sword of the day is, followed by what Togame and Shichika's topic of the day will be, and maybe even the back story of an enemy ninja or swordsman that they have to fight. Needless to say, the story is well layered and overall very interesting to follow along. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Katanagatari seems to do a pretty decent job with them as well. Both Shichika and Togame are rather interesting to watch, and have a strange chemistry that makes you laugh and genuinely bond with them as characters. Each has a back story that even now (5 episodes in) has been looked into a fair bit, but still left in enough mystery to keep the viewer immersed in the series. The series being episodic by nature, has many MANY characters that appear for maybe an episode or 2 before disappearing or being killed. Each usually don't have much of a back story, but often are acted on really well and make one wonder what their life must be like. Overall the cast holds together quite well, with no one being particularly memorable, but nobody being bad by any means.\\n\\n\r\nNow every series has some flaws and katangatari is no exception. Each episode happens to be set for 45 minutes, which helps make the one month wait less painful, but generally leads to a lot of filler. The action scenes are usually pretty short for what they could be, and the characters quite often seem to get caught up in idle conversation... that can be funny at times, but you know its just padding out the episode. Another problem is the release schedule for this anime. Now releasing one hour long episode every month for a year is a pretty unique way of doing it, and sounds pretty cool when they do it, but it really does dowse the overall feel of the series a little bit. One can forget a lot in a month, and usually you don't go into the new episode with quite as much enthusiasum as you might of a month earlier.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, those are rather small complaints. The story is good, the characters interesting, and the show itself works quite well. I'm not exactly a huge fan of the action genre, but Katanagatari definitely got my attention, and I plan to see it all the way to the end, and I recommend you do to.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nI was really excited for this show and hyped for its ending because I had heard really good things about it and its ending. On the r/anime subreddit I go to, people consistently put it up for \"best endings\" or most \"solid arc\" or \"great character development\", but while I liked this show initially, it started to lose its luster a bit with its episodic repetitiveness, long runtime (45 minutes approximately, which I think hurt it more than helped as I felt they rambled too much and could've had a faster pace). Some of the dialogue confused me a bit for thetalking, and I didn't care as much for the historical ties ultimately. The end was also disappointing even though it tied things up a bit at least.\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably because I prefer happy endings, but I was really disappointed with this episode. I think I really wanted to root for the love in this show, between the two MCs and how much they liked each other. I know Togame did some bad things for the wrong intentions, but I wanted her to redeem herself and the two to live happily, because I thought they both suffered enough through their lives and deserved happiness at the end of their quest. In this, even after losing both his family, Shichika is left without anyone close to him, and Togame was a tool until the very end - it just doesnt send the happiest/most hopeful message imo. Maybe it goes \"deeper\" and I miss something, but I ultimately think a happy ending would've been better/fine for this. What was there gained with Togame's death? What does that say about Shichika's and Togame's happiness? What message is the show trying to give with all this?\\n\\n\r\nThe gauntlet was honestly cool but also disappointing. I'm glad Shichika is stronger, but if he doesn't struggle and fight the swords at their best, there's not as much meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI did like his eye change though, and it was heartwrenching, his goodbye. I found his following of Hitei to be ironic and somewhat interesting, but I also find it a bit weird. I don't know if I dislike it or not - probably a little glad he has some company but I'd've preferred to see him and Togame together at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI think overall, this show is close to being good but not quite enough for me and falls as \"above average but not that far above\". I think some of the dialogue at times could be drawn out and a bit pointless (still better than Bakemonogatari but still bad in this), and some of the themes and ideas I just dont agree with. Things like \"be a tool for another and its okay\" or \"fall in love and do whatever the person says\"...things like that are...not good messages for a friendship or relationship, even if they're somewhat humorous and enjoyable to watch. The quirks and stuff for the characters were interesting, but the constant deaths and killings disappointed me. There was no sparing the good sword owners at all, and I didn't feel connected enough to a lot of the deaths ultimately. I'd prefer if the good people could live and find a purpose in life - I think that'd send a better message for the show. As it is, its a bit humorous and entertaining, but I'm not sure its in a way I enjoy as much. \\n\\n\r\nI also felt the episodicness got repetitive after a while - there wasn't that much contuinousness - it was always just find new sword + find new way to obtain sword. Sure, some maniwani and shogun stuff happened in the background and the show tied more things together in the end, but for a good few episodes, it was a bit repetitive and I felt no new spark. And the initial enjoyment I got died out a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSome good things: you did get to see Shichika really develop, and I did feel Togame and Shichika's bond through the episodes and really enjoyed that. I liked their romance, and it had some good humor between the two. It wasn't afraid to kill its characters (but imo it did it in a poor way, without letting us feel a connection. Other shows like HxH have more deaths too but we really feel the stakes more in those deaths imo) and push some common ideas/tropes out the window.",

            "content": "Ok, first of all i didnt get to watch all episodes. the reason im still writting this review is because this is aimed to give a warning to the people planning to watch this show and the fact is that its boring. (reasons below)\r\nanyways im not leaded by subjectivity and this review is done in the most objective way possible.\r\nNow that i said this lets begin with the review.\r\nfirst of all, katanagatari is a show that really attracted me. i mean i looks good, has acceptable number of episodes and the story has potential to good comedy and action. i feel this is the reasonwhy its so overated as you see most of the reviews here have really good scores. my theory is that those are made because people start this show with the illusion its good and keep believing in it cause its potential. however im not.\\n\\n\r\nNow, strong points:\\n\\n\r\n-The art and animations are beautifull, you get attracted to it when you see it and its very easy to get use too for being that unique.\\n\r\n-formula that cant fail: action+comedy+romance usually is the way to go if you want target general public.\\n\r\n-story seems very good. its simple but that simplicity manage to tell you what to expect.\\n\r\n-The actions scenes are great. the fights are dinamic and with cool techniques\\n\\n\r\nNow the flaws:\\n\\n\r\n-Senseless dialogs. huuuge flaw i mean, i feel they went for 45minutes episodes because they wanted to speak more. i mean it could easily be a 21minute episode if you were to erase that. and its not comedy, they try to explain every little thing they do even its too obvious. it really annoys you if 90% of the episode is talking.\\n\r\n-Short action.  for a 45min episode i would expect a good amount of action. however not only the action scenes are very short they are caught between senseless dialogs. \\n\r\n-Bad comedy. really a lot of jokes are just not funny. however they manage to pull out some good ones but screw them out. how would you say? well they take a good joke and talk about it for 10 minutes when the joke just isnt funny anymore.\\n\r\n-having a narrator is annoying to much to explain here.\\n\r\n-Lack of characters. i mean besides the two main characters and maybe one more there are no other characters that you would expect to see in other episodes which makes each episode less related to the previous one.\\n\r\n-the first fight i was really looking for wasnt shown. really maybe a good prank for your cousin but its lame when you expect a good fight and end up with a dialog of how good the fight WAS.\\n\\n\r\nThere may be more to these lists but i state again i HAVENT seen all episodes but i have to say if the first 5 episodes didnt attract someone (half the series) the other half is wasted cause everyone will drop the series before it. so maybe all thsi flaws are repaired in the next half i dont know but if you want to risk and go for 5 boring episodes go ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is an anime that I came to surprise, not to discredit, but the other animated works of Mr. Nisio Isin have seemed very mediocre, under this prejudiced thinking, I present myself before Katanagatari\r\nOh, and there will be spoilers\r\nThe story of Katanagatari is not surprising at all; A long time ago, a sword-maker called Shikizaki Kiki forged 1000 swords, of which 12 are said to be the swords that Shikizaki could perfect; the Shogun wants to recover those swords (after innumerable failures) and for that the Shogun sends the young Togame to speak with the current head of the Kyotoryuu clan, Yasuri Shichika.\r\nThe story, asI said, is simple, but the author knows how to captivate us with the stories of the 12 swords that Shikizaki Kiki forges, I say this because stories are told at the beginning of the story and epics; that a person possessing one of the swords can defeat only 100 soldiers (or more), that the swords are worth more than a country or that many times the government has been betrayed because of the value of the swords. Everything is exaggeration makes you have immersion, it assumes that Katanagatari is not a realistic series, since that would take away the essence to the way it narrates the majesty of the swords, with this point I would like to make clear that all the stories that are told on the swords they help immersion (many will say that I am exaggerating, but later I'll go deeper into that).\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of what I told before, about how the main focus of the story develops (which is the story that the swords and their users keep), now it's the introduction, being honest, the introduction seemed mediocre; the introduction of Togame and Nanami's meddling in situations was pretty bland. Togame explained almost the entire synopsis in about 10 minutes to the protagonist of a very poor narrative, as if they wanted to vomit the whole plot from one moment to another without pauses to reconsider everything heard, not even Shichika came to wonder why Togame told him all, it is true that the introduction gives way to ironic comments by Togame (ironic and cynical comments abound in the work), the reasons that Togame gives Shichika to fight at first are ridiculous, but also try to parody one of the most used topics in stories of adventure or action, shoveling for love.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the first chapter (which would be the introduction) after the 18th minute or so, achieves its purpose, you can appreciate the good animation, the oriental soundtrack that is wonderful in several scenes (special focus to the soundtrack that it sounds when Shichika uses his \"special technique\" to Koumori), he introduces himself to the first enemy dynamically, creating a formidable design for Koumori, besides having many extravagant scenes, like when he takes the sword out of his stomach, if we put all this together we make an introduction that can be very pleasant, the explanations were mediocre, but this is compensated by some ironic comments, the intrusion of an enemy that is not boring, fluid animation and pleasing to the eye and even more pleasant soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are in my opinion a strong point along with the battles, I would like to clarify since each character feels unique due to the characteristic design that each character has besides the exaggeration that they put on many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWith that clarified I would like to talk about the chemistry and dynamics generated by our leading duo; Shichika has an evolution throughout history with Togame, not only can you get to understand a little more about her romance (we must take into account that at the beginning Shichika said that he loved her in a very empty way, but in the end Togame's death caused a great mental shock in Shichika). but is the Shichika evolution well achieved? I would say yes, after Shichika has faced death so many times with Togame it is normal to assume that evolution is credible, this sounds superficial, but let me dig a little deeper.\\n\\n\r\nShichika knows practically nothing of the outside world, he has not even experienced love as such (it is true that he obviously loves his sister, but it is not the same kind of love, logically), the impact of knowing that Togame is the descendant of the person who was killed by Shichika's father causes him to generate a strange sense of duty with Togame, normal taking into account the values \u200b\u200bthat his father taught him, precisely from there arises the seed of a love that at first is superficial and very soso, but through actions and dialogue you can see that their relationship progresses well (take for example chapter 2, Shichika says that a plan to make Kinkaku leave your room is causing the death of Togame, obviously this happens, but then in combat Shichika jumps in Togame's face to defeat Kinkaku, Shichika says that this is necessary, but then does not use Togame in the same way, not even when Shichika is in great danger (in chapter 8, when they face the doll, Shichika never approaches Togame despite that it would do him good to buy time, or in the chapter where he faces Nanami, he gets mad when Nanami cuts his hair). Outside of that Togame at times talks about how he wants to defend Shichika or prevent him from dying at all costs (as in chapter 2, where Togame says that Shichika is not allowed to say his \"last words\" or chapter 9, where many misunderstandings and Togame realizes that he has to act quickly to continue with Shichika). At the end the relationship progresses through the 2 protagonists are knowing more about each other, which is clearly seen in chapter 10, the last cusp would be the last chapter, where Togame speaks to Shichika without fear, without pretense or masks, telling him unpleasant things that would normally be annoying, just to end up saying, can I fall in love with you Shichika? So showing all the feelings of Togame, this is not a deconstruction of their relationship, is what makes it so real, Togamr says absolutely everything to Shichika, but even with that, she could not help telling Shichika that she wanted it, The last thing he wanted to say to Shichika was a demonstration of love, that's in my opinion one of the best-achieved scenes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that the protagonists evolve in a good way, Shichika goes from being a sword to being a true man and Togame becomes a woman who knew how to obtain her goal in life and knew to know the true meaning of love, achieving that the evolution of the characters complement very well with their relationship, in this section I like the series very much.\\n\\n\r\nRelevant secondary characters there are not many; Emonzaemon seems to me the most wasted, having a decent personality and a potential promising past is only relegated as the princess Hitei's doll, which would be acceptable for the plot, but this fact totally oats the personality of Emonzaemon and makes him a disappointing character , it is not explained why he wants Princess Hitei so much or what happened to his clan a long time ago or because he knows Houou, it is true, Emonzaemon does several tasks to move the plot, but otherwise it turned out to be one of the things disappointing anime, a character with potential and a design that I think is great, at least his death and combat is one of the best in Anime, causing him to die in a successful way.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters that added points to the anime; the first to be Houou, the Maniwa within the story is simply a joke, at first the es\u00f1ectativas are high because the first member of the Maniwa had a sword, but in the second and third chapter a member of the Maniwa is shown only to be killed by the person who has one of the 12 swords, but this is unnecessary because you already know in advance the power of those who own swords, so this does not have much use to the plot (although it must be said that these 2 Maniwa were assassinated quickly had good design accompanied of an abnormal charisma, taking into account that they appear very little), although it sounds like a negative point, in reality the Maniwa are something good that has the anime, it is true that the first seem a waste, but they all have such unique designs, such unique movements and they make them so extravagant approaches that, although they die fast, they manage to be a visual delight, but not only that, I liked the Maniwa, as well I like the jump they have to chapter 4, where Maniwas are shown more human without becoming boring, 3 members are killed by Nanami (the protagonist's sister) and the way he cheered on stage was accurate, beyond being good it was precise, it was played with the unpredictable and they made the 3 most human Maniwas so far are killed in a brutal way, in order to feel sorry for them, the Maniwa won a certain recognition in that chapter, presnetado very well and in a way He needs 3 characters (I love how they used the approaches well to not show the ability of the Maniwa Chouchou and thus hit) that at first glance would seem pathetic, because the Maniwa had only been a punching bag, an excellent demonstration of the Maniwa; similar cases occur later with the Maniwa in chapter 6, 9 and 11 (I think those chapters are) where Maniwas are shown again that if they serve for something and manage to keep the audience entertained.\\n\\n\r\nTalk about the Maniwa, but what about Houou? It is assumed that he was going to speak, Houou is the typical character who does not go for a fixed side and has no clear objective, his actions throughout the history show great determination and the moments in which he seems the plot of he moves in an exact way, his personality is not overshadowed, his struggles are not either, the ironic and intelligent dialogue (for in most of his dialogues he talks about strategies with the other Maniwa) that are used to promote events in a natural way, especially end of the anime, where he gets the 11th sword and causes the complete destruction of the village of the Maniwa (although his combat is not the big deal), Houou seemed to have a past with Emonzaemon, but on Houou's part it is known that he destroyed Much of the village of Emonzaemon, but not much more, on Houou's part this is forgivable, since Houou's motivations are very distant from having to do with his past with Emonzaemon; In short, Houou is a very curious, extravagant character, the character that for me has the best design, one of the characters with the best dialogue and one of those who moves the plot, a character that undoubtedly fulfills its objective in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that caught my attention was the Princess Hitei, it may be that some consider her as the antagonist or something like that because practically his fault died Togame (I take to say that the construction to get to the scene of his death is impeccable), but his role would say that it goes beyond simply being that, the presentation of the character as such is for me a nod, Togame had talked about Hitei a few chapters ago, but had not been seen (also served to get an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat kind of life Togame had before and thus generate more immersion, because not all people can talk to a princess), I would say that Hitei's dialogue is one of the best, his ironic dialogue reveals important parts of the plot in a way in which the spectator is going to take him by surprise (however they are not badly executed or abused situations), a clear example of this is chapter 9 (I think) where Hitei reveals that he is descendant of Shikiza Kiki Kiki ironically and engages in a conversation with Emonzaemon where the interactions are so peculiar that they left me a bit dislocated, but then I immediately realized what was happening, which is quite intelligent on the author's part; also it is worth noting that Hitei is like Houou in the sense of boosting the plot, one of the positive things about this anime is how the vast majority of characters serve to drive the plot, but with Hitei she felt as if she had planned the majority of the events from the beginning, it was very interesting how they explained all this in the anime, even in the end she seems a new person, because she does not have to be tied to the government's mandates and it shows that she pays homage to Emonzaemon (you just have to note that he wears his mask), so I feel that Hitei was a very well-carried character.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of technical issues this is for me a wonder, the scenarios, the changes of planes (special focus in chapter 4), the animation, the color palette and the soundtrack is simply amazing and all this together is even more incredible , everything combines and highlights the right parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy had me a bit doubtful at first, it is true that the dialogue contains comical and ironic moments, but some jokes that are not funny as the joke of the cherio, who never graces grace and when Togame discovers wrong stat the joke is lengthened about 5 minutes, in chapter 9 the sudden approaches in Shichika can cause a bit of grace, since he does not know how to use a sword well and take advantage of that to make jokes about him in chapter; What made me \"funny\" (the quotes go because it was a very special moment) was chapter 4, with the battle against Sabi Hakuei, Sabi is probably the character that has the most baddas design, scenes were dedicated to him in the chapter 2 and 3 where it showed a little of their personalities and skills, all this combined with the fact that it was known in advance that he was the strongest swordsman in all Japan caused me a hype (especially seeing the progress of the chapter 3, yes, here is the special that looks at the advances), to finish off it is said that he can cut the moon, all very epic and if, the battle does not happen, all the stage prepared to make that joke, many got angry, but when I went to capitile 5 the only thing I did when I remembered chapter 4 was to laugh and say \"what trolling took place there\", the joke was planned in a spectacular way, everything prepared just to do that, the best thing is that throughout chapter 4 There is little talk about the protagonist's sister and they are in charge of showing us how powerful she is, in this way they make such a brutal and surprising turn that makes you easily forget the epic combat between Shichika and Sabi. The second best chapter for me without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally I would like to talk about some issues, from the beginning it seemed that history would repeat the formula of a chapter we get a sword and ready, without much depth, but having such incredible designs, scenarios so colorful and varied (besides that most of the swords are different, that is, by God, a sword is a doll and the other an armor), but what I loved was how the different people were different: Past, Personality or simply the way the combat; all that makes the fighting seam unique and fresh (especially the capitilo 2, 3 and 9, which leave a great lesson in Shichika and will serve to mature), so the anime knows how to handle his formula in an ingenious way, it would be stupid resume the series in \"a chapter a sword\", because it ignores all the rest that makes the fighting great.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to leave a short dedicated space talking near the end, it sounds weird, but Shichika in the final chapter reminded me a lot of Gon from HXH in the chimera ant saga, Shichika is someone if I evolve, but it took away something precious, that I caused a shock so big that it clouded the mind, I lost my mind, so I say that is equal to Gon, both lost something precious and then reconsidered and returned to act normal, but with very remarkable psychological sequels, Shichika was angry and showed everything that he learned in his trip with Togame, is even poetic, Shichika ended up in the Shogunate (I think that's what it's called) to lose his life, being that Togame left in that place, who gave him life and to finish in that place he uses all the techniques that he learned with her, I am glad that Shichika has not died and the end is left with that feeling of melancholy for the trip of \"vagabond\" Shichika that (and returning with the comparisons) reminds me a lot of Ken shin by Rurouni Kenshin; the\\n\r\nThe narrator's words at the end are beautiful, I have to say that they moved me (especially when Togame is seen next to a tree).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion it seems to me that this anime is spectacular, it was a great surprise; he fulfilled expectations that he did not even have (that in itself only makes some sense), he has a few mistakes, but they are compensated in a phenomenal way, an anime I would recommend to friends and remember, not only for all the positive points I mentioned, but Because I will remember the laziness that gave me to see the 50 minutes of the chapter and in the end I always wanted more, that's all",

            "content": "You could pretty much summarize the whole plot of Katanagatari (sword story in English) by it's title. Because, it really is story about two people traveling around japan, collecting twelve magical swords. However, when you actually sit down and watch it, you will probably get more out of it than you had expected. \r\nStory: As I said before, it has a pretty simplistic story. The story follows the 2 main characters as they set out on a journey all around Japan to collect twelve swords. the main focus of each episode is a new sword for the two to collect. When they are not fightingto collect another sword, the characters are probably spending their time talking to each other. This might sound boring, but the dialogue is well written and even really funny at times. Depending on your taste, the fact that the episodes are 45 minutes long, and that a lot of that time is spent on conversations between the characters might be a turn off.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Katanagatari is well... interesting to say the least. Its very colorful and eye catchy, this is mainly in part to keep the viewers attention while the characters talk themselves to death. However, corners are not cut when it comes to things like attention to detail and backgrounds. Some of the backgrounds in the show were even pretty darn beautiful. The fight scenes were also done very well, and the animation was fluid during them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: While I don't specifically remember any \"standout songs\" in the OST, the music does fit the shows theme and era very well. It sets the mood of the show and does it's job when needed. The OP's and ED's were also very good. the voice acting was pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Because the show has a big focus on dialogue, the characters that are talking have to be interesting, or else the show would just be boring. Luckily, the characters in Katanagatari are pretty darn interesting to say the least. The two main leads of the show are really neat characters. At 1st they seem like generic anime archetypes, however, they definitely have their own personalities quirks that set them apart from the crowd. Also, they go through quite a lot of character development throughout the show ( Sad that this is a bit of a rarity these days). Most of the side characters are not given enough screen time to fully flesh them out, however they each have their own unique personalities and motives. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My own personal enjoyment of this show is really high, between the witty dialogue and interesting characters, I found that there are almost never a boring moment in the show. However, I can definitely understand why some people would not enjoy this show as much as I did. If you are going into this just wanting a dumb action show (absolutely nothing wrong with that),you are probably going to be disappointed. Also, the sheer amount of time spend on talking, witty dialogue or not, could turn you away. However, if you are looking for something just a little bit different from the norm, then I think that this show has a lot to offer.",

            "content": "==[ Katanagatari - Overall: 9.5/10 | 12 episodes]==\r\nOne-liner: If you want an anime with amazing art, great character development, good romance and an ending which you cannot predict from episode 1, Katanagatari is for you.\r\n[ Introduction ]\r\nKatanagatari, or Sword Story, is about the Strategian Togame and her \"sword\", Yasuri Shichika. The story is about their journey to collect 12 legendary deviant swords made by master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki.\r\n[ Story = 9 ]\r\nWhen I see animes about a journey to collect swords, I generally think: \"Sword fights to be expected. Blood and gore. Severed limbs. Magical sword. Ooooh... Duh!\". Katanagatari is about swords, of course, butnot your run-of-the-mill sword anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo what will you find: sword fights! Duh no. Not many sword fights! But... but! It's a sword anime! Yes, but not so many sword fights. Interesting huh? Romance. Was kind of expected. Lots of lovey-dovey kissing? Nope. It's more of a... weird kind of... love. Comedy. Yes, fair share of good laughs. Plot twist. On the menu too. Main character gets beaten, levels up, gets beaten, levels up. NO! NO! No level up! AT ALL! So awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI found the pacing a bit slow sometimes, with a bit too much dialogue between the characters. A few particular scenes were stretched the limits of my patience. However, one can argue that the slow-ish pace is used to build character. One would be right. Still feels a tad slow at the start.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the story is unpredictable. There are no cliff hangers! No cliff hangers! In a modern anime, can you imagine? All episodes are basically stand-alone except the last two. I really liked the story. It's simple, really. But it's so well narrated that it doesn't feel simple at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unpredictable, but each episode follows a certain pattern. Tip: There are 12 Deviant Blades. There are 12 episodes. See a pattern?\\n\\n\r\n[ Art = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\n9.5 really. The art is not your classic anime art. It's hard to describe... Don't expect big anime eyes. Don't expect anime expressions. Ok maybe a few. Don't expect anime faded colors.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you should expect are vibrant colors that look like pastel, well-designed character models and excellent backgrounds. It's one of the animes you can watch just for the characters and art. Definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth, well detailed - even fight scenes. Costume design is especially great. I liked how Katanagatari shifted from \"known and tried\" art to something interesting and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nFor some people, the art and animation can feel slow and simplistic. Almost un-moving. For me, that's what makes the beauty of Katanagatari. Remember, it's a sword anime. It's supposed to have fast animation! Explosions! Clash! Not a relaxed animation!\\n\\n\r\n[ Sound = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\nUhh.. if you read my reviews, you'd know am not really good at rating sound. For Katanagatari, I'd say the music really fits the situation, and the episode intro music (very Samurai-ish) was really nice and mood-setting. Haha... Sorry. Not very satisfying huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a bit wordy. I didn't mind. The background music helped with that.\\n\\n\r\n[ Character = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\nAhhh the major attraction in Katanagatari: characters. It's one of the animes I've watched where I truly liked the character development. It's slow, methodical and done in great timing. Nothing is revealed too early. Some things are not revealed at all. No plot holes, I think.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is only 12 episodes, but it has a ton of characters. Thankfully, the two main characters: Togame and Shichika are explored in depth, their relationship getting major screen-time. Their journey together and interaction gets much attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are all unique, and I can't say I've found their similars in other animes. Like, Katanagatari features ninjas. You'd think, yeah, black-outfitted ladies and dudes with masks. HAH! Think colorful animal-themed clothes instead! Also, they all have their own stories and it's not just insignificant stories; sometimes their stories do play a major role in the episodes. They're all likable, even the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting part? There are no bad guys! None of the characters are portrayed as \"bad\" or evil. There is no arch-enemy. Even the character you think are bad guys are only trying to get their share of the action. They have their own reasons and their own troubles. As another reviewer mentions, you may even come to like the \"bad\" guys...\\n\\n\r\nSadly, there is not enough character development. Some of the characters' stories are not explained at great length. The episodes are 50 minutes each but you'd still feel like the side characters are not explored in enough depth. Example? The Maniwa Corps. The background story of their members are hardly explored. Same for Shichika's sister. Shichika's mother is not mentioned at all. Togame's background story is breezed on, and I still don't completely get it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, good main character development, interesting character relationships, good character background-stories, likable and memorable characters but unfortunately, not enough in-depth exploration of each character's story.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment = 9.5 ]\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Katanagatari. It even made it to my Favourite Animes! So what did I enjoy?\\n\\n\r\n- The art. I really liked the pastel-like colors, the feeling like everything is drawn on paper. Really changes from the \"normal\" animes out there with big sparkly eyes etc.\\n\\n\r\n- The story is not what I'd expected. There are a few plot twists and \"wtf\" moments which spice up the plot. Good pacing. It never feels too rushed. Except maybe last episode which I think should have been a bit longer, say 20-25 minutes more than the other episodes to completely wrap up the story.\\n\\n\r\n- The characters: A very nice, likable set of characters. I also enjoyed how each had an elaborate background-story.\\n\\n\r\n- The relationship between the main characters. Not what I'd expect in an anime like that. It's just fun! I.e. the non-fighting parts of the anime didn't bore me. Also, I did say there are not that many extended fight scenes overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I DIDN'T enjoy:\\n\\n\r\n- Not much I should say. Am quite satisfied.\\n\\n\r\n- I wanted some characters to be developed in greater depth. E.g. Shichika's sister who is just... unimaginable!\\n\\n\r\n- The anime is a bit wordy. LOTS of talking. I didn't mind that, but you may so am listing it here since people complain about it.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall = 9.5 ]\\n\\n\r\nGood anime. Very, very easy to overlook. One hell of a lost opportunity if you do miss it. If you are on the lookout for an anime with distinctive art, good character development, an interesting story, a good bit of romance and an ending which, in my opinion, fits the anime, then check Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nOh and... CHEERIO!",

            "content": "Finally, the cross-genre blend of Jidaigeki and Hard-Boiled Mystery the world has been clamoring for.\r\nOh, well apparently I have to write a longer review to actually submit it so I can't leave it on just that note, but Katanagatari is exactly what you're expecting when you hear the phrase \"Nisioisin does a swordfighting series.\" \r\nEvery character, all the way down to the most minute, single-scene appearances, are fleshed out and eccentric in their own ways, with backstories and special powers and character arcs to keep you thinking about them long after they (for the most part) are torn to pieces. Half the series is justcharacters in conversation, and a few of them exist mainly to break the fourth wall or to deliver critical exposition. It's a giant chess game between protagonist Togame and antagonist Princess Hitei, and most of the plot is obscured by the fact that these masterminds are withholding all the information from the cast (and from us, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe story, a journey to collect twelve swords with twelve strange superpowers, really is just a mystery novel every episode; the goal is absolutely not in delivering a story that works on suspense and twists and turns, and instead gives us puzzles to solve-- how does each sword work? How the heck's Shichika going to defeat his opponent this time? Because of the amazing cast of characters, this formula works really well and compares favorably to similar defeat-a-bunch-of-eccentric-villains stories (e.g. Scott Pilgrim, Ninja Scroll).\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is primarily a comedy, working on silly circumstances, weird punchlines, actively making fun of the viewer (you'll know the episode when you see it)... but once again, the cast makes the emotional moments really work. Almost every character has their own arc, their own development, their own tragedies. Their paths collide, people die, and the story moves on, but it's continuously a sad, lonely journey for our two protagonists even as the story keeps the tone light. Balancing the jokes with the legitimate emotions is a tough one, and just like with the Monogatari Series, Nisoisin's writing pulls it off. Somehow.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is lovely, a mix of cute and cool that plays to the mix of drama and comedy that I just talked about. The animation is iffy in places, no more than any other TV anime, but kinda noticeable here when every episode is a full fifty minutes each. The fight scenes, luckily, are all great. But you'll definitely notice some cheap animation techniques, a lot of still frames where a bigger budget would have been a lot more dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, some of the episodes, especially later on, really didn't need that hour-long episode time and you really felt that they could have mashed a couple of the stories together without losing anything. Still, nothing was egregious and there were not noticeably poor episodes out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say Katanagatari is a masterpiece of television or anything, but it sure got pretty close to being a true epic, and one that could only be done in the world of Japanese animation. Watch this if you're into good television.",

            "content": "Yo boys, you should totally watch this series!\r\nHowever, by that point you'll have been torn to pieces.\r\nDear those who want to watch Katanagatari...\r\nYou may have witnessed a lot of disappointment from those who watched this show. The main reason (and sometimes the only reason) behind these instances of disappointment is the extreme lack of action. People start watching this show expecting high octane martial arts fight scenes filled with badassness, but really, that's not the focus of this show at all. Instead, what people get is talking. At least 90% of this show is just pure dialogue. \r\nI was one who knew about this dialoguething before I watched the series, and not because others told me about it beforehand, but because I noticed that this show is the pinnacle of the anime medium, a LIGHT NOVEL ADAPTATION! And who is light novel by? By none other than Nisio Isin, who is well known for the Monogatari franchise. If you keep in mind this fact, starting this show expecting anything other than talking is stupid in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I love Talking: The Animation so much? It's simple. Katanagatari may be the least boring anime that I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series makes dialogue fun to watch in its own unique way, and that is SHAFT VISUALS. Through the constant transitions of scenes, imagery, weird poses and head tilts, the dialogue becomes bearable due to the weirdness happening around it. Katanagatari doesn't do this. When people talk, it just shows their lips moving real fast, with a couple of facial expressions here and there to spice things up. What makes Katanagatari's constant dialogue not boring is the sheer quality of the dialogue. Full of wit and borderline Gintama levels of self-awareness, the interactions and conversations that the characters have are just simply... entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThere have been moments in almost every anime that I've watched where I had to check to see how much time was left in an episode, even in thrill rides like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Even despite the 50 minute episode length, this has never happened once during my watch of Katanagatari. 50 minutes just pass by in a flash, to the point where I watched 6 episodes in one day and had to force myself to take it slower. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't mention Katanagatari without mentioning the incredibly unique artstyle. Katanagatari is drawn like a Japanese painting, and while some may think that this classifies Katanagatari as an artsy show, it really isn't. It's just a simple adventure filled with wonderful character interactions. It doesn't have the incredibly deep themes, mysteries, and other philosophical ideas like other artsy shows, such as the Tatami Galaxy and others.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is the story of Katanagatari? It's basically a fetch quest. Well, I actually like to call it the epitome of \"It's about the journey, not the destination.\" These are words that I've always lived my life by, and Katanagatari expresses it very well. The fact that the show focuses more on the character interactions, no matter how insignificant, rather than making a complex story, is basically telling you to enjoy all the things in between, not the beginning or the end. The relationship between Togame and Shichika is also a great example of living the present, while putting aside the past and future. I would go into more details, but that's spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what else about our dynamic duo? Well, they are dynamic. In fact, they are probably the most dynamic pair of anime protagonists that I've ever seen. Togame and Shichika have incredibly contrasting personalities, to the point that they are almost polar opposites. This makes their interactions, both little and important, very refreshing and enjoyable. Shichika is emotionless, but not like the Kuudere type of emotionless, but like the innocent child who knows absolutely nothing type of emotionless. He also delivers a lot of punch lines, albeit unintentionally. Togame sets up all the comedy between them with her self centered and confident attitude, only to have her confidence shattered in the most hilarious of ways. Did I mention that this show is self aware? It really is. Togame almost breaks the 4th wall so many times, which I absolutely love. I really can't go into detail about their development together, so all I will say is...\\n\\n\r\nI love the way they loved each other.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that noitaminA opening? Absolutely EPIC!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Cheerio!",

            "content": "Since 2006, light novel adaptations have gradually become a regular feature in anime as producers in the industry scrabble around in their attempts to find the biggest cash cow since the advent of Suzumiya Haruhi. The surprising thing is that the fallout from this has actually been a lot better for fans than one might expect, and while titles like Guin Saga, Kemono no Souja Erin, Ghost Hunt, Baccano!, Kure-nai, Rental Magica, Spice & Wolf, and NHK ni Youkoso! may not be as commercially successful as KyoAni's behemoth, they do represent a gradual shift in the industry towards creativity and originality.\r\nWhich is where Katanagatari comesin to the picture.\\n\\n\r\nWritten by Nisio Isin (although he usually writes it as NisiOisiN since his name is a palindrome), the twelve volumes of the original light novel series were published as part of the Kodansha Box line. Strangely, all of the books were released at a rate of one per month from January to December 2007, with a spin off novel published in February 2008. Now while this is clearly a phenomenal feat, one does have to wonder if a few corners were cut for the sake of expediency and to meet deadlines, and also if the adaptation can stand up to scrutiny.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is basically what the title suggests - a story about swords. It begins with fire and death as a rebellion against the Owari shogunate meets a bloody end. Twenty years later, a small boat makes its way across the sea to a deserted island where the passenger, Togame, hopes to enlist the aid of Yasuri Mutsue, the 6th generation head of the Kyoutouryuu sword style and the hero of the rebellion.\\n\\n\r\nInstead she finds Yasuri Shichika, who is more bumpkin than the term allows for, and is also as hard as nails.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that really stands out about the series (aside from the visuals, but we'll get to that in a bit), is the dialogue. The show is very well scripted with some very good conversations and witty repartee, and the explanations are usually clear and concise enough for the viewer to follow. There are also numerous verbal nods in the direction of modern popular culture, which makes a nice change of pace as one might normally expect lots of serious conversations about honour, loyalty, duty, revenge, or other concepts that are usually found in these types of story.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem though, is that the dialogue can also be off putting for viewers who want a little less conversation, a little more action (sing along if you know the words), especially as the fights are over in a very short space of time. In addition to this the story can sometimes err on the side of predictable, especially with the number of plot coupons that drive the whole show (in this case the \"cursed\" swords), and the series can sometimes become nothing more than a repetition of talk, talk, talk, fight, talk, end. The biggest criticism about Katanagatari though, is that it's nothing more than a very nice looking \"fetch quest\", and while the dialogue really does pull the whole show together, the storyline can sometimes feel derived or contrived.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes the series stand out are the rather stylized visuals. The design principle attempts to merge several themes ranging from traditional Japanese art to modern fighting games, and while there are some flaws here and there, the overall effect is ... something else. The scenery is surprising to say the least, and almost every frame is literally filled with little details that will often go unnoticed by the viewer, from the grain and different tones found in wood, to the multiple hues and fractures of stone.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to this the characters are simplistic yet colourfully flamboyant. The costumes vary from the utilitarian to the nonsensical (especially those of the Maniwa ninja corps), while the characters themselves have exaggeratedly simple, almost cartoon-like, facial features. Oddly enough, whilst one might expect this sort of design to lack in terms of expression, the opposite is true for Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nWhite Fox, who produced Tears to Tiara and are currently working on Stein's Gate, have done a tremendous job with the design and animation of this series. The characters have a certain grace about their movements that belies their simplistic appearance and sometimes clunky costumes, while actual combat scenes are extremely well choreographed and animated, so much so that the individual moves of Shichika Hachiretsu (Seven hits, Eight Pieces), are clearly defined.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the art style may not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you can handle it then there's a pretty good story here.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the defining aspects of a good narrative is the strength of the scriptwriting, and because of the extremely strong dialogue in this anime, it's often easy to overlook how good the actors actually are. Hosoya Yoshimasa's role as the \u00fcber country bumpkin Yasuri Shichika may have caused him some consternation as the character is effectively emotionless for a good portion of the series. That said, his deadpan delivery works very well, and can often make the viewer stop and try to work out if what he says is meant to be a joke. On the other hand, Tamura Yukari's not-quite-tsundere Togame is sometimes a joy to watch, with the character's many mood swings and emotional changes handled with aplomb. But then again, what else would one expect from an actress who's also played Takamichi Nanoha, Kawasumi Mai (Kanon), Furude Rika (Higurashi), and a horde of other lead and supporting roles.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, given that Hosoya only has a handful of shows under his belt it's amazing he managed to keep his head working alongside such an experienced seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari features quite a lot of music in the form of two opening themes, twelve ending themes, and a plethora of background tracks. The OPs and EDs are handled well, but given the number of songs on offer, deciding what works and what doesn't is very much a matter of personal taste. The incidental music is another matter, as while there are scenes where the music dominates proceedings, the majority of the series features either very subtle tunes that are almost unnoticeable, or no music whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe nice thing about this approach is that the dialogue doesn't have to fight to lead a particular scene, and while the more subtle background music is pleasant enough, this is ultimately a \"wordy\" anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of shows like Katanagatari is that they have too many characters for their own good. While Shichika and Togame are played confidently, have some well though out dialogue, and generally bounce off each other like peas on a drum, the same cannot be said of the supporting characters, in particular the Maniwa Corps who seem to be nothing more than a collective of whipping boys whose only role in life is to prove just how strong Shichika and his sister are.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't mean the characters are bad though. Both Shichika and Togame's emotional development is handled in a very competent manner, and as their relationship slowly becomes more defined, so too do their actions change towards each other and the world around them. Unfortunately, while a lot of attention is lavished on the two leads, there is very little left over for the supporting cast, which is a shame as there are some great performances in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow while the series has a lot to recommend it there are some valid criticisms that can be levelled at it, the main one being that Katanagatari is far too \"wordy\". See, the problem is that since the dialogue is very good, someone has decided that the series should have more of it than it actually needs, and the upshot of this is that there are occasions when the characters just go on and on. Now it should be pointed out that a part of this is because the series parodies certain stereotypical behaviours found in shounen anime and manga (and James Bond stories I might add), which is nice, but ultimately unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a strange anime that's part \"fetch quest\", part wuxia tale, and strangely enough, part Seinfeld (i.e lots of people being dryly humourous, deadpan or witty), which isn't a normal combination by any measure. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime for its originality and innovation, as it would have been all too easy for White Fox to follow the tried and tested route for samurai anime, so the fact that they decided to stick with Isin's concept of how the characters should look is laudable.\\n\\n\r\nNow if only the other studios would start broadening their horizons ...",

            "content": "'Katanagatari' ('Tale of Swords') is about Togame, a self-claimed \"General Director of Military and Offering Affairs serving under Yanari Shogun Family of Owari Shogunate\", and Yasuri Shichika, the last inheritor of swordless swordsmanship \"Kyotouryuu\", and their adventure to collect 12 legendary swords.\r\nOriginal work written by the same author as 'Bakemonogatari', this is a dialogue-based series that I cannot recommend to Shounen and other viewers who seek mindless battle scenes, you can ignore my warnings... \"but by that time, you'd be slashed into pieces.\"\r\nThe story of 'Katanagatari' is driven by the characters who stand in the way of the sword gathering. New characters and weapon ofthe month are introduced in every episode. Through negotiation and battles with Togame and Shichika, we learn about their opponents' backgrounds and purpose to fight. It can be said that the story progresses by disposing expendable side characters. The story may be about the main couple gathering the 12 swords, but the show is really all about why people fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this series heavily relies on \u300c\u3059\u3079\u308a\u82b8\u300d, the comedy through deliberately failed attempts to be funny, which in turn creates a humorous atmosphere for its sheer lameness. The frantic pace of conversation was the key to making this comedy style work, as well as the persistence (such as catchphrases, Togame missing the battle, sexual implication etc) in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the series makes character development difficult, but it was made possible by dedicating each episode to a theme or lesson for Shichika, and sometimes Togame.\\n\r\n1: Intro\\n\r\n2: What to protect\\n\r\n3: Purpose\\n\r\n4: Friendship\\n\r\n5: Love/Resolve\\n\r\n6: Conscience/Loneliness\\n\r\n7: Death\\n\r\n8: Human Will\\n\r\n9: Discipline\\n\r\n10: Swordsmanship\\n\r\n11: Fate/Past\\n\r\n12: Freedom/Future\\n\\n\r\nShichika started out as an emotionless weapon that blindly follows Togame's orders, acting as her sword. By facing the variety of opponents in their journey and influence of Togame herself, Shichika gradually grow up as a human being, learning ways of the society and new emotions with each encounter. Character development was excellent. By end of the show, Shichika was no longer a brutal killing machine; he had his own purposes and opinions. Character design was fantastic in this series. Everyone was easily distinguishable. Even those who died quickly had very distinct personalities and features that left lasting impressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter naming was pretty interesting in kanji, such as Shichika --> \"Seven Flowers\", Togame --> wordplay of \u300c\u5341\u304c\u76ee\u300d(Eye is a Cross) and \"Blame\", Hitei-hime --> \"Princess Denial\". Every name basically describes the person.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the characters is that every adversary in this show had a sympathetic or honorable reason to fight. They were too lovable. I believe there should be at least one character for everyone to hate in this type of action/adventure series. There should've been an enemy who was simply a serial killer who loved taking life, or a corrupt leader oppressing the innocent civilians. I also felt sorry for Maniwani, for being defeated (often easily) in every single battle against Shichika or Sword-holders.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode summarizes and concludes the series well, lots of cool action, and the funniest scene occurred in stage 10 of dojo-yaburi, with Hakari the Scale. I also liked how in the end, it showed that possession of powerful weapon is pointless unless the wielder has the skill and knowledge to make full use of it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI still consider 'Bakemonogatari' voice acting to be the best ever, but 'Katanagatari' is a close second. Togame (Tamura Yukari)'s voice takes a while to get used to, but it grew on me in time. Shichika (Hosoya Yoshimasa)'s voice sounds like reading the script at first, but not really; quite humorous and emotional when needed to be. Other than that, everyone else's voice was an instant hit (this is important because some of the characters were dead within minutes of appearance), which is quite a feat because there are over 30 major characters in this series. This is another series that made me think \"Seiyuu sure are amazing\".\\n\r\nBGM, on the other hand, makes a strong case for a new benchmark. It should be noted that at least one new piece of BGM is played in every episode, but all pieces flows so well that it doesn't sound like deliberate theme music for each villain. Most pieces are fully orchestrated in Western or Japanese traditional instruments, charged with the grandeur of the adventure. Others are jovial Japanese rap that serves its purpose by being so bad that it's funny. However, it's not the quality of individual number that makes the background music of 'Katanagatari' remarkable, rather its application. Every number is used in exactly the right places. The most distinguishable characteristic of the implementation is that the music start well before each significant scene to build up the tension, harmonizing with the story to enhance the drama as they climax with absolute precision.\\n\r\nOP1 was very catchy with good balance of anime beats and traditional Japanese atmosphere, but OP2 was average. EDs are different for every episode. Ep4, 8, 12 were particularly strong songs, but all were shared by outstanding vocals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter in this series had extremely crude designs, with background detail of varying degree. However, the artwork has a very unique style that creates a Japanese fairytale, picturebook-like atmosphere that suits this series well. One can tell the animation director and staff went lengths to visually compliment the story with wonderful \"camera work\", composition, and fabulous fight scenes.\\n\r\nI want to believe that the character designs are simplified so that they (especially the protagonist) begin as blank canvases, and their impressions and details painted in viewer's minds as the show progress through words.\\n\r\nThe art quality in this series is technically inferior compared to most shows airing this year, but in my opinion had one of the best presentation and style. Probably hit or miss depending on tastes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are limits to episodic storytelling, the show had great character development and interesting story. The story was full of surprises and unpredictable turn of events despite it being a simple tale of sword gathering. Quite innovative and bold in style with both artwork and plot development. There were many great episodes in this series, I hereby declare episode 2, 4, 10, 12 \u300c\u795e\u56de\u300d (godly epic episodes). Episode 7 was one too, though it probably had been possessed by a demon than god in many ways.\\n\r\nPerhaps it's a result of loose deadline due to monthly episode, but you can tell the staff paid close attention to perfect everything, from animation to sound to story structure.\\n\\n\r\nIt was one hell of an adventure around Japan. In spite of all the flaws mentioned above, 'Katanagatari' is a series that I enjoyed tremendously. This series was filled with so many interesting quirks, and I will definitely remember it for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nCheerio! Let's all hype up this word with the wrong meaning.",

            "content": "\"I have just come to a realization! This scroll by Broken Sword contains no secrets of his swordsmanship. What this reveals is his highest ideal. In the first state, man and sword become one...\" - King of Qin, Hero\r\nI originally stumbled upon this anime thinking it was a continuation of the Monogatari series. It's not. But it's a great show nonetheless. What wowed me about this show was its pacing. Katanagatari is easily one of the most well-paced animes I've ever seen, and the pacing reminds me a lot of BBC's Sherlock series. Each of the 45-minute episodes are like a mini-movie, leaving very littlein terms of cliff-hangers, yet keeps you wanting more, if and when you have time. For me, it made for a good series to relax and watch with my girlfriend on the weekends of my hectic whirlwind lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did I choose to start with a quote from an obscure 2002 Jet Li movie? Well, the one thing that probably caused Katanagatari's score to drop a few points for a lot of people was its ending, which undoubtedly left 90~% of viewers confused and angry. So, I decided to take a metaphorical stab at an explanation (for which I will enlist the help of this obscure 2002 Jet Li movie) that will hopefully shed some light on the true meaning behind Katanagatari, and help you reach a more fulfilling understanding of what the heck you just watched. However, as my explanation contains light spoilers, I will leave it at the end of my review for you to read after you've already finished the series. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the review:\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Katanagatari is both very straightforward and somehow wildy unpredictable. It follows a rinse and repeat cycle where our heroes, Togame (a delicate strategist) and Shichika (an emotionless jungle boy), face off against an enemy with a powerful and unique weapon, find some way to defeat them, and subsequently take their weapon. It may sound dull and repetitive, but the show does a great job of keeping things fresh with cute/clever interactions between Togame and Shichika, who are superstar characters in their own rights, but I'll get to that in a bit. The only thing the story is lacking is depth behind each character's motivations. Togame is collecting swords for the Shogunate, which is the enemy of her loving deceased father, while Shichika is there because... I have no clue. He claims it's because he fell in love at first sight with Togame, but his attraction is rather platonic. I think the real reason was because he was bored. That's not to say their relationship seems fake. Katanagatari doesn't pull love out of thin air like some animes do (*cough* Angel Beats!). While the relationship between Togame and Shichika starts off a little suspicious, and the show doesn't try to hide the fact that Shichika comes off as this asexual weirdo, it develops into something that seems very real by the time we get to the closing credits. Throughout their travels, Shichika undergoes a very subtle transformation from emo-jungle-boy to fun-loving prankster that's shown in the way he interacts and teases Togame. It's all done in a Flowers for Algernon kind of way, meaning the narrator doesn't have to tell us that Shichika and Togame are changing, it's just obvious. It's really refreshing to see an anime that shows us things rather than tells us what to think, wouldn't you agree? (NOD YOUR HEAD) But still, the initial motivations behind each character's actions leaves a lot viewers scratching their heads. This, of course, is compounded by the problems people have with the ending. It's not just Shichika and Togame either. All of the characters have a tendency to act in unpredictable and senseless ways, from Hou-oh, a beloved clan leader randomly decapitating his dear disciple to Shichika's sister running around killing people for no reason. None of their motivations seem to make any sense. But motivations aside, it still gets an 8 out of 10 for it's combination of fun-filled subplots, clever battle sequences, and colorful cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\n- Art (9/10) -\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever watch an episode of an action anime and thought, why is there no fighting in this episode? Well, Katanagatari never has this problem. There's fighting in every episode. And while the fighting is not flashy (or forced for that matter), it is very well drawn and sensibly creative. The style is not detailed, except with some of the scenery, and the artist takes liberties with the shape of human bodies and faces, but it's all still very cool looking. It all reminds me a LOT of Gurren Laggan. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it fits well with the style of the anime as a whole. There are two weird things about the artwork that might annoy some people. First, like the artist for Gurren Lagann, this artist doesn't like to draw normal looking eyes. I don't mean having something like the Sharingan of Naruto canon, that's actually connected the story. I mean some characters will just randomly have pentagons for eyes, because why not? And second, the art style changes slightly after the first few episodes (the lines get noticeably thinner). I don't know if this is to show aging (older characters are typically given lighter lines in anime), but it's all made very obvious during flashbacks. But if you can disregard those two things, I'm sure you'll find the graphics as entertaining as I did.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (9/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe opening/closing and the music in general fit well with the anime. That's really all I can say about that. The background music has a modern/Sengoku style to it that reminds me a bit of Samurai Champloo, but more Sengoku and less modern than Samurai Champloo (there's very little rap). And obviously, it's by a different composer (RIP Jun Seba). Actually, I think the opening is by the same band that did the Monogatari series. Anyways, it's all very good. The intros/outros are memorable, although neither of them really wowed me. The voice acting was underrated as well. However, I've only seen the sub.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters (9/10) - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the best thing about this show. The main characters, Togame and Shichika are both very distinct and clever. Neither of them fall entirely within any anime cliche. The repertoire between them is great, and they both have some very memorable lines. The development of the characters is relatable as the pair try to find meaning behind why they fight, what it is they're searching for, and what they really want out of life. The side characters are also very interesting. All of the enemies are unique and interesting. In fact, even the guys who only get 10 seconds of screen time are interesting. I'm going to say \"interesting\" one more time for emphasis, just in case you didn't catch the first 30 times I said it. They all have fun quirks about them, and none of them really came off as annoying. One good example of this is the Maniwa Corps, a group of ninjas that are sort of like what Team Rocket is for Ash and Company on Pokemon, but way cooler. The difference is that while Team Rocket is made up almost entirely of storm troopers clones, every single of one of the 12 (14?) Maniwa members are unique. About 5 seconds ago (or 10-30 seconds depending on how fast you read), I mentioned that none of them come off as annoying. Well, that's not entirely true. The fact that their motivations often fail the logic test, as I mentioned earlier, can come off a bit annoying at times. But even this does little to make them full blown annoying characters. Even Hou-oh, who I mentioned briefly earlier as acting out of random uncharacteristic impulse, turned out to be one of my favorite anime side characters in a long time. Basically what I'm trying to say is that the characters have minor annoying tendencies, but the core that makes them who they are is solid, and will keep you invested in them. \\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMemorable dialogue? Check. Fun scenarios? Check. Colorful characters? Check. Fulfilling story? Check. Top-notch pacing? Check. Meaningful fight scenes? Check. A spattering of fan service here and there? Ding Ding Ding. We have a winner.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIts not the greatest show I've ever seen. But it's definitely worth the watch. I honestly believe it would be rated a lot higher if people weren't so upset with the ending. To cure that, I've decided to write an explanation. So if you haven't yet finished the show, PLEASE STOP READING HERE. If you have finished the 12 episode series, here's my take on what the ending was about...\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: Light Spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari (or Story of the Sword), taken as a whole, is about the falsification and course-correction of history. So it only makes sense that the first question we should ask is what part of history was corrected and what part was falsified?\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with what was falsified. The subject matter behind this story is China, not Japan. And Shichika is an anime-parallel of Jing Ke. Name sound familiar? If so, either you're a history buff or you've watched too many Jet Li movies. Jing Ke, as some of you may know, is the main character of the 2002 Jet Li movie, \"Hero\" (although in the movie, he's known as \"nameless\"). And the history that is course-corrected is Jing Ke failed assassination of Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, and the man who would later become China's first Emperor. (the name Shichika in Japanese means \"seven,\" which could refer to the seven warring nations of Han before they were united under Ying Zheng) He's also the one who ordered the eventual construction of the great wall of China to fend China off from foreign invaders, which the anime briefly mentions. The legend goes, Jing Ke earned an audience with Zheng upon presenting him with a present - the 12 broken swords of his greatest enemies. But in the end, Jing Ke failed because of two critical mistakes. First, he was paralyzed with fear for both himself and his loved ones at the sight of the King, and second, he was too slow in retrieving the poisoned dagger he hid in the scroll he presented to the King.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the stage is set, let's move on to course-correction. While it's true that Emperor Zheng built the great wall, he was actually hated in China. The construction of the great wall cost the lives of millions, and Zheng was remembered as being a ruthless coward. And so peering into the future, Kiki Shikizaki (and his descendant Princess Hitei) attempted to course-correct Jing Ke's failed assassination by getting rid of his two weaknesses - his human heart, and his need of a weapon. And so he taught Ke's ancestor the Kyotouryuu and created the deviant blades as a condition precedent for Ke's meeting with Zheng. Lastly, by killing Togame, the love of his life (who's name in Japanese means \"Blame\" as in the one to blame for countless deaths), Princess Hitei fulfilled her ancestor's goal in getting rid of Jing Ke's second weakness, and turning him into a perfected weapon, without residual attachment to the world. This allowed him to overcome his fears, and even go as far as to wish for death. And so all the blood shed would not be in vain and millions of lives are saved from the clutches of China's first tyrant. Of course, this would mean that Zheng could no longer build the great wall to protect China from invaders, to which Shichika replies (and I'm paraphrasing) - we'll just have to trust the heroes of the future to tear them to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so that should explain what happened. I may be wrong, but at the very least, it gives you a basis for understanding the theme of this story. By focusing on what could have happened (history), rather than what did happen (anime), the ending should hold a bit more weight. The story doesn't do that, it really couldn't. That was something that had to be left to the viewer. Another thing that probably upset people is how Shichika ends up with Hitei. Well, that's something you have to look at in context of the overarching theme of the anime - the falsification of history. History is written by the victor. Now ask yourself who you think the narrator of the story is. It could only be one person. And once you've figured that out, things should become clearer. History is written by the victor, and in this case a victor with a penchant for falsifying history. Is it not possible that the ending was a lie too? Call it a narrator's wishful thinking, if you must. Hopefully, you were able to figure out what I meant. I can't solve all your riddles for you. It would take too long. And by then, I will have already torn you all to pieces. Cheerio!",

            "content": "I simply cannot grasp why this anime receives so much praise.\r\nSPOILER-FREE\r\nWhite Fox adapted this from the light novel Katanagatari, and although they have the same author and a similar name, it has no connection to the Monogatari series in style, substance or story. The two main characters romp through a mythologized version of feudal Japan, neatly divided into formulaic episodes, collecting swords and killing fucking everyone they see.\r\nKatanagatari is by no means a terrible anime, but if you look at the way it is treated, you might think it\u2019s an absolute masterpiece, or panders to the shounen crowd excessively. Neither is true. The world andaction are so ridiculous and clich\u00e9d that you might be forgiven for thinking it is simply a parody. If Katanagatari deserves any praise (which indeed it does), it is for managing a certain level of uniqueness. However, uniqueness alone is not enough to carry a series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a twelve episode anime about collecting twelve swords. As such, you may begin to notice a pattern that the anime follows. In case you can\u2019t I can spell it out for you: find the sword, find the wielder of the sword, get ready to kill sword wielder, fight scene, kill sword wielder, take sword. Fortunately, Katanagatari is not so obtuse as to staunchly follow this formula for every episode, but it can get pretty tedious at times; sometimes the biggest surprise an episode will shock you with is how few people die.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, none of the characters have any qualms about killing even friendly characters, resulting in one of the highest body counts per episode I\u2019ve seen in anime. Not that it is necessarily a bad thing, but Katanagatari just makes it annoying; out of a cast of dozens of characters, you can count on one hand those alive at the end. There is even a set of twelve characters who exist for no purpose other than dying violent deaths as soon as they\u2019ve received their quota of characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThis \u201cquota of characterization\u201d brings me to another annoying habit of this show: a naruto-esqe need to explain every technique and move of every character. Announcing attacks beforehand already makes the action scenes a little silly, and very few characters indeed do not at least once give a lecture on their fighting style, magical moves or weapons, usually in the middle of a fight. This highlights the more prevalent flaw of excessive dialogue. For an \u201caction\u201d show there is not nearly enough action. A lot of this does contribute to the story and characters, but some of it makes me wonder if it wasn\u2019t just to fill up their 50 minute time slot.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the ending deserves special attention. Jarring would be an understatement, a better description would be \u201cfeels like it\u2019s from a different show.\u201d All of the characters in the final episode have their personalities nearly reversed, and events transpire that makes the rest of the series relatively meaningless. It feels terribly contrived and without spoiling too much, it is a massive disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is unique. Opinions on the character designs will be very subjective; they are certainly atypical of anime. Over the course of the series they will likely grow on the viewers. Backgrounds are colorful and charming. The art really does not fit the story and setting but some will love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe real weakness of this show\u2019s art is the animation. It starts out passable, but as it goes on you can almost see a counter on the screen as White Fox\u2019s budget for this show drops. Fight scenes are the only part that gets any special attention as the show goes on, and even their quality drops over time. It starts out fairly pretty but increases in still frames, simple designs and reused animation become more obvious. If I did not know they spent a month on each episode I would say it looks rushed. Overall this extreme inconsistency leads to some parts looking quite attractive and others looking really awful.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Katanagatari is pretty lackluster, but often fits very well with the show. The music definitely contributes to the mood of scenes. The voice actors complement the show far worse. Tamura Yukari does a brilliant job as Togame. Unfortunately other characters generally deliver their lines with all the emotion of reading a string of numbers with a director over their shoulder shouting \u201csound angry for this scene!\u201d The sound effects really shine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the point of Katanagatari. Whether you like the show are not, everyone will agree that the action, story and everything else are secondary to the character development. Unfortunately, this means the show puts incredible effort into one area that ultimately falls flat on its face. The only good thing I can say about the characters is they are not stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are particularly unimpressive. They are incredibly shallow and most are killed off as soon as they receive just enough development to elicit an emotional reaction from the lowest common denominator. I also can't count the number of \"Japan's strongest\" that come out of the woodwork.\\n\\n\r\nTogame, Shichika and their relationship are the real focus of the show. Throughout the show they slowly develop from a largely superficial relationship into one of real trust between partners. Finally, at nobody\u2019s surprise, romantic love blossoms between the two. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding this make it unsatisfactory. And it happens during the final episode, which I have mentioned involves everyone acting tremendously out of character.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough their interactions are very strong, Togame and Shichika themselves are rather weak characters. Shichika especially is quite the Gary Stu, with a lot of forced development. \u201cWhy does he fall for Togame in minutes?\u201d Because he does. \u201cWhy does he suddenly get way stronger?\u201d Because he does. \u201cWhy is he unable to use a sword?\u201d Because it makes a convenient plot device. This sort of thing is constant.\\n\\n\r\nOne last problem that bugs me particularly is that Katanagatari succumbs to temptation and commits one of the cardinal sins of anime character development: \u201ccHAIRacter development.\u201d This is changing hair style, especially cutting a female\u2019s hair short, to demonstrate character development. It is usually done when the character is so weak that a superficial change is required to show growth. It was completely unnecessary and just annoying.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t hard to get caught up in Katanagatari. If you can overlook some flaws then there isn\u2019t any reason you can\u2019t enjoy watching it. The ending is lousy, but the ride to get there can be pretty fun at times.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and focus on characters make this show unique, but uneven animation, disappointing characters and the ending cause this show to fail at being what it wanted so desperately to be: special.",

After the death of his father one year before the show began Shichika inherits the title of the family head. This comes with the secrets of the sword less sword style which is dubbed \u201cKyotouryuu\u201d.  This is an anti-sword martial art that uses the body to disarm and break the opponent\u2019s weapons. To the Yasuri family their life and body is nothing but a sword.

Then she  states has a quest to find the 12 deviant blades of the legendary sword smith Shikizaki Kiki. These blades are so powerful and valuable that they can change the course of history itself. The Shogunate has tried for years to claim even one of these blades to no avail. Togame then asks for Shichika\u2019s help.  She personally has failed numerous times to get the blades. She has used those who fought for money and those who fought for honor.  First she used those who fight for money. They simply stole the first blade and ran.  Then she tried those who fought for honor. Yet, those who fought for honor could not resist the honor of owning such a prestigious sword. She then states she needs a warrior who will fight for love.  She needs a person that is devoted to her and only her.

What follows is a grand journey of introspection, love and human nature that will shake you to your core.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Story) \\n\r\nKatangatri is written by Nisio Isin whose most notable work is Bakemonogatari. Katangatari is much like the former in the style of its dialog and use of symbolism/ stylized art. Katanagatari though is a much more focused story than Bakemonogatari.  Katanagatari is told in 12; 50 minute episodes. Each episode of Katanagatari has Shickika and Togame going after one of the 12 deviant blades. These episodes aired once a month during 2010 from January to December. In the show the seasons changed in correlation with this.  It also takes them 1 month to get each blade making it move in time with the real world. This creates a feeling of connection with the journey.  Every episode Togame and Shichika meet a new person with one of the blades. Shichika having no knowledge of the world learns something new every episode and develops accordingly.  You watch through the journey as the \u201csword\u201d that is Shichika becomes human.  He starts as something without his own will, who simply listens to Togame as her \u201csword\u201d.  He then develops into a human with a will and moral compass. By the end he has his reason to fight.  It is a journey of twits and turns in a world that has change on the horizon. It\u2019s a show that will keep you guessing to the eventual outcome of each episode. Showing you that things don\u2019t always turn out the way we plan, no matter how much we wish it.  Just as you think you have it down, it catches you once more. Better yet its twists are heavily foreshadowed and don\u2019t feel like ass pulls. This journey then culminates into a final conclusion so epic and heart wrenching that it cannot be spoiled nor missed; it will \u201ctear you to pieces\u201d.  One thing to say is this show is very dialog heavy.  Its great dialog don\u2019t get me wrong, it just can be a turn off for some. But its not to say is doesn\u2019t have epic fights.  The fights are great with fluid chorography and animation. It\u2019s simply not the main focus. As far a story telling goes Katangatari is an episodic journey of the highest caliber. It is simply breathtaking in execution and conclusion. (10/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Character)\\n\r\nThe main characters of Katanagatari are the aforementioned Togame and Sichika. The main thing keeping this show interesting during its 50 min episodes is the dialog. The banter between Togame and Shichika is clever and charming. It also makes the developing romance feel much more real to the viewer.  Each character including the 12 owners of the swords have a developed back story and a motivation to fight, some good some evil. The development for Shichika mostly comes when he kills the good and the evil owners without any remorse or caring, simply because it\u2019s Togame\u2019s will. Yet as he hears the dying words of each and the different motivations he realizes he has nothing he fights for himself. He gains his own moral code and also gains reasons for why he follows Togame. Now I shall talk about Togame.  She has many names, \u201cThe stratigen\u201d, \u201cthat unpleasant woman\u201d, and others names that would be spoiler territory. She is an energetic, manipulative, and clever woman that seeks the blades for unknown reasons that latter become clearer. Togame , like Sichika learns to love, and her moral code changes as she learns from the owners and Sichika. The Dialog, development, and generally script writing in Katangatari is top noch. The only gripe I have is some of the more important villains (who shunt be named) had too little back-story to them. It was hard to understand the final motivation for the final owners (can\u2019t get into detail\u2026 spoilers). Yet the dialog and characters are an overall crowing achievement. \\n\r\n(9/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Art)\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a stylized symbolic adventure with art that looks like it comes from an old legend.  The animations during the fights are one of the many high points in the series. They are well choreographed and fluid. The character designs and weapon designs are well handled and animated. Each owner has an interesting design. Animation was handled by Studio \u201cWhite Fox\u201d who are a subsidiary of OLM Inc. They are a very new studio whose first work was in 2009 and Katangatari (2010) being their second work ever. The most notable thing they have animated was the widely popular Steins;Gate anime. It\u2019s symbolic, light art style that can instantly turn dark complements the show perfectly.  It is not without flaws. The art does have a few glitches here and there. I did stop and notice some errors in animation during many of the dialog sequences. Yet the fluid motion and dynamic animation at most points make up for its occasional errors. \\n\r\n(9/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Sound)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Katanagatari is very\u2026 interesting.  It utilizes rap in a mix of Japanese and English under a back score of traditional Japanese music. It can sound epic as it wants to and does a very good job of doing so. What surprised me was that it could also sound beautiful.  To be compared it shares a similar musical style to the Samurai Champloo sound track.  The rap in Champloo was handled by Najubes, while Katangatari\u2019s rap and vocals is handled by an artist called Lotus juice. The overall composition was handled by Taku Iwasaki who also handled Tegen Toppa Guerren Lagan and JoJo\u2019s Bizzare adventure (part 2) sound tracks. The original Op\u2019s and Ed\u2019s are good, just not amazing. YET, Katanagatari received a new op for its 2013 rerun which is possibly on of the greatest anime openings I\u2019ve ever heard. I say this because of how well it fits in with the show. The song itself and the visuals are amazing. The Ost choice is easily this opening. It is done by the band \u201cSupercell\u201d titled \u201cHakushi Kassai Utaawase\u201d. This is for the aforementioned reasons. The sound track overall is good, some tracks stand out and others aren\u2019t noticed much. Better than most and serves its overall purpose. \\n\r\n(8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment)\\n\r\nTo state I simply \u201cenjoyed\u201d this work would be a slight understatement. It has firmly entrenched itself into my favorites list and my soul.   Katanagatari is a grand episodic journey of introspection and human nature. Throw in a good sound track, great dialog, and tons of great moments.  You got yourself some great enjoyment. Truly this was an excellent use of 12 hours. \\n\r\n(10/10)\\n\\n\r\n(Verdict)\\n\r\nKatanagatari is one of those diamonds in the rough. It starts as a simple journey, but turns out to be so much more. A quest for 12 swords over 12 months, the turning  of a \u201csword\u201d into a human being with thoughts and wants. It\u2019s a show who\u2019s art, sound, and setting work together to lead up to one of the grandest conclusions in anime history.  It leaves you with a feeling of loss and the questions of, \u201cwhat do you fight for?\u201d Money? Power? Your own dream? Or the one you love?  Do you have the will to do it? What will your dying words be?  Will they be that of regret? Or words to be remembered?  No matter which they all end in death. With that on this evening and month I polity close the curtain on this review.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score Katanagatari: \\n\r\n(9.45)\\n\\n\r\n-Raptor\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is interesting because it's one of the better anime in recent time (that I have seen), one of the best anime from 2010 (that I have seen) and arguably the best work of NisiOisiN (that I have seen, even though this only includes two titles).\r\nNow, Katanagatari is great, it's absolutely wonderful, but depending on your ability to immerse yourself in a story so much that you forget time this may or may not be for you. If you are like me with the attention span of a goldfish, initially the 50-minute long episodes might scare you off. If you are able to put upwith it, however, you are in for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nI will not summarise the series because frankly you can look at the anime description for that, that and I doubt I will make it that much more interesting. I will just go through why I like it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all there are the characters, which I think are the main driving force behind this anime. They bounce off each other really well, providing good (but not ROFLOL hilarious) comedy and creating an overall likable character dynamic. The side characters are also fairly good, they do their thing, but for the most part you will not see them for more than one episode, so they do not matter too much. I will also give points to the incredibly forced romance. I like that Katanagatari doesn't even try to build it up naturally but instead approaches it like \"Yeah, we're in love even though we've shared a whole of five miniutes of screen time. Deal with it.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are short but very energetic and well directed. While they are very good, be warned if you are going into Katana thinking it wll be 90% action; it will not. In fact, much of the anime is spent on dialogue. Think Bakemonogatari, just not quite the same bullet pace.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track is excellent, and while I do not think it stands out per se the music tracks are used very efficiently, creating just the right mood every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be descriped as fairly minimalistic - it certainly does not stand out in terms of production values - but it gets its job done and does it well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari is gud, you should definitely check it out if you like dialogue and good action scenes, but due to the length of the episodes you may or may not be able to marathon through it. Also: dat last episode.",

            "content": "What is it that you fight for? Money? Power? Honor? Love? Revenge? Out of all the millions of reasons , in the end does it really matter? These are some of the things you will ponder while watching Katanagatari. Nisio Isin, the mind behind the monogatari-series, which some might call a twist on the harem genre, has used his deft hand at creating unique characters and worlds, in what would traditionally be a shounen premise. The end result, is a masterfully crafted tale that blends Japanese folklore, romance, and martial arts with a very contemporary touch that makes Katanagatari feel both modern and old atthe same time. Simply put it, Katanagatari is a story of both the ages, and the here and now. It is a wonderfully crafted tale that I had the pleasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9/10)- Katanagatari's premise is essentially the typical shounen premise. Yasuri Shichika, master of the swordless sword style, Kyotouryuu, lives on an island with his older sister, Nanami. They know nothing of what life is like in the outside world, until one day an intruder interrupts the tranquility of their island. Togame, a self-proclaimed strategian, enlists the help of Shichikia to acquire the 12 deviant blades for the shogunate. In any one elses hands, Katanagatari would've been ridden with cliches and tropes found in many popular shounen anime/manga. However, Katanagatari is anything but typical.\\n\\n\r\nIn all of Nisio Isin's works, dialogue is always at the forefront. Katanagatari is no different, it is probably even more so since each episode is a whomping 50 minutes long. But that is exactly where the show succeeds, in it's dialogue. The dialogue is witty, clever, intelligent and insightful. All without being verbose and mundane. The conversations often provide background and motivations for characters and do a phenomenal job at world building, bringing the world and characters to life while giving it a touch of realism.That is not to say the plot itself isn't interesting either. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, there are a lot of unforeseen twists and turns that serve to deepen the plot without being convoluted or contrived. All the plot points are revealed at the right time to cause the greatest impact on the viewer. It is not this often that a story is able to hit all the right notes.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)- The art for Katanagatari is nothing short of beautiful. It has a very vibrant color scheme that your screen will be glowing the entire time. The character designs are a bit atypical because they seem more.....cartoonish. They aren't overly detailed but aren't so base that you can't remember what they look like. The backgrounds are detailed to that point where the world itself becomes a character.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10)- The soundtrack is nothing short of memorable. It is composed by Iwasaki Taku who is famous for his work on Rurouni Kenshin Trust and Betrayal, Now and Then Here and There. The soundtrack is a unique blend of jazz, Indian flutes, and traditional pieces that compliment the world adding to its character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10)- By far, the best thing about Katanagatari is the relationship between Shichika and Togame; how their relationship grows and how they mature throughout the story. Shichika starts out as a bland individual. He lacks any traits, besides his strength, that cause him to stand out. He is essentially a living weapon. Each encounter he has with an enemy, leaves a lasting impression on him, causing him to change little by little. Throughout the show, you see him make the transition from a mere weapon, to a human being. You feel as though you are changing with him. \\n\\n\r\nThe encounters not only change the characters themselves, but also serves to deepen their relationship. With each encounter Shichika has with an enemy, it adds another dimension to his relationship with Togame. He starts out as merely a tool for her to use, but slowly she grows to love Shichika. The same for Shichika as well. He follows Togame blindly without any reason but over time he finds a reason to fight. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains are not mere caricatures either. Due to the length of the episodes, the villains are fleshed out to the point where they are human. They each have their own reasons for pursuing the deviant blade, along with a distinct personality and world view. It is rare that a show gives development to almost every character in the cast, in a seemingly short time frame.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion(9/10)- Katanagatari is a tale both grand in ambition and in scope. It is one of the view anime that accomplishes what it wants to without compromises. A stong narrative, and strong lead characters put it head and shoulders above nearly every anime out there. If you have the patience to withstand the lengthy conversations, the pay off is well worth it. I give Katanagatari 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Cheerio! \\n",

            "content": "Considering the amount of love this show has received, it feels risky giving a comparatively low score to Katanagatari, although I don't personally consider a 7 by any means low. Please don't label this review as \"not helpful\" just because you disagree with the scores or think they are too low. This is a difficult show to review because a) most of my complaints are directed to the plot and character development, both of which are difficult to describe without spoilers, and b) some of the complaints can also be considered reasons why this show is amazing or unique. Unique is indeed one of thebetter ways to describe Katanagatari, but let us get into the review.\\n\\n\r\n*STORY -- 5 -- MEDIOCRE*\\n\r\nAgain, it is difficult to explain the score without specifics, but the best way I can describe this show's plot is that it is both far too predictable, and far too unpredictable. The show's structure is essentially as follows: each episode takes place a month apart and features the two protagonists, Yasuri Shichika and Togame, locating one of the twelve legendary swords and obtaining it in one way or another. Having a show running on a formula such as this runs the risk of killing the show's unpredictability, since the plot is literally formulaic. You KNOW that the protagonists are going to succeed and take the sword that episode. This makes some of the more drawn-out segments that rely on suspense fall somewhat flat, since you already know the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps in an effort to counter this predictability, the show throws many moments that seemingly come completely out of nowhere, but rather than feeling excitingly unexpected, these moments often feel cheap or underdeveloped. There is often a lack of proper build-up to many of the show's twists or turns, making the viewer feel cheated or downright confused. There are the occasional moments where this unexpectedness works extremely well, particularly in episode 4, although that episode in particular highlights an issue regarding the anime's characters which I cannot explain without spoiling it (basically, it highlights how uninteresting the two protagonists are). Unfortunately, these better moments are few and far between. The last few episodes in particular, while praised as some of the best in anime by some, feel particularly prone to random new plot threads that the show expects its audience to accept. \"AHA SURPRISE! THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE PLAN ALL ALONG!\" is not a good plot device, nor is having one of the characters go around performing unexplainably overpowered deeds and him simply explaining it by saying \"It is not necessary for you to understand what just happened.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe show is definitely inconsistent in its quality. Certain episodes are actually quite excellent and well-paced. Others are downright awful and are entirely exposition where the protagonist goes on some mind-bending LSD adventure in an effort to get him to understand something of great importance -- a common trope in anime. The quality of the episode seems very much related to the characters featured, so I will touch on that later.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's focus seems to be on its dialogue, which is mostly a good call, since the interactions between characters are the show's strongest moments. However, it often feels that the show's writers know that the dialogue is good, and decide to take it too far. As a result, many of the dialogue scenes drag horribly with seemingly no reason but to fill time or show off. The pacing definitely could have used a bit of work.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the dialogue is generally excellently written, the actual writing of the show is surprisingly poor. If that's confusing, let me try to explain by saying that the show has a tendency to tell rather than show, which is not a good writing strategy. Sometimes a character may be telling something rather well, but that doesn't negate the fact that they shouldn't be telling it in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the show's unpredictability and copious amounts of dialogue can be used as examples of why Katanagatari is unique and therefore deserves praise. Although aspects are certainly unique, it still feels very much like a typical anime at most times. Even when the show manages to be unique, a show needs to be more than just that -- it actually has to be well executed. I simply cannot call Katanagatari's story well executed despite its attempts to be different.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTER -- 6 -- FAIR*\\n\r\nThe characters are what manage to save the show's content from disaster, although they are very far from being excellent. The protagonists in particular are a great target of criticism. Togame's character is overall extremely static. She hardly changes, aside from her feelings and attitude towards Shichika. This wouldn't be a huge issue on its own were her character not so stock and boring. She is the stereotypical high-tempered, jealous, easily embarrassed, pouty female trying to make a name for herself but unable to alone because she is essentially incompetent. She definitely improves in the competency department later on, making some successful strategies, but she is a far cry from being interesting or unique. Some of her backstory is better than her actual character, but suffers from the plot's problem of throwing sudden, unexpected globs of information at the audience and expecting you to care.\\n\\n\r\nShichika is the other protagonist and his \"development\" in particular bothers me. He displays the guise of having tremendous character development, changing from being a completely blank person -- literally a tool (sword, in this case) -- to a caring human being. He can best be described as a robot learning he has feelings. Unfortunately, it is not impressive character development to go from nothing to a human being. What IS impressive character development is to go from a human being to an INTERESTING human being, which Shichika never becomes. He essentially manages to become a normal stock character, which almost makes him less interesting than how he starts out as. At least when he is nothing but a tool, he has that unique aspect of having no idea about human emotions or the outside world, which is played off for humour decently well. He does display the odd quirky moment, and you can only wish there were more of such glimmers of personality.\\n\\n\r\nWhat, then, manages to save this show? That would be some of its secondary characters -- namely, those who wield the swords the protagonists must obtain. These characters are certainly not all great (one character in an episode in Ezo in particular was simply terribly developed, or rather, wasn't at all), but a few of them bring you into their world and make you care about their fates. This is extremely effective and is one of the ways the show's predictability is somewhat mitigated. By knowing that these swordsmen are going to lose, the episode becomes something of a tragedy, as you realize this world they have developed and rely on the sword to maintain are going to be destroyed by the two protagonists. As such, episodes that feature the most interesting swordsmen are also the best episodes. Unfortunately, only a few of these swordsmen end up being this interesting, so the praise can only really apply to a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Maniwa Corps, a ninja corps that appears throughout the entire show, is a particularly strange presence. Without spoiling too much, their appearance in each episode eventually becomes something of a running gag that I personally found quite humorous. This could probably be a criticism, and in a way it is, because these characters are woefully underdeveloped, but in this case, that actually feels intentional and in a way that doesn't feel contrived or cheap. Still, they certainly could have done without them entirely for the most part, which probably isn't the best sort of characters to have.\\n\\n\r\nNanami, Shichika's sister, is probably the worst-written character in the entire show in my opinion, which is an incredible shame because she starts off as potentially one of the most interesting. She makes an appearance early on that completely steals the episode in a surprising way, which is one of the show's best moments, but the next time she is featured, her character is so poorly and suddenly developed and the episode's contents are so messily executed that I would probably consider said episode the worst in the series. They eventually explain what happens at the end of the episode, but by that point, the damage has already been done.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a massive host of other characters, namely a couple that appear in the latter stages of the journey, many of which are also underdeveloped. There are simply too many characters for this show to handle in its time frame, which is a shame, because all of the voice performances are generally excellent.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*ART -- 9 -- GREAT*\\n\r\nThis show's art is by far its strongest aspect. The production in general is fantastic, with a unique art style that, while not personally my favourite, has moments of startling beauty and a sort of painting-like quality that makes many frames feel like classic Japanese art. Some of the character designs are a bit questionable, but overall, the art is superb. Unfortunately, there is one episode in the middle of the series where the art style completely changes, and while I can't comment on any possible artistic reasoning, all I can say is that the episode feels like it was produced on a budget. Whether this is true or not, I have no idea, but there is noticeably less movement and quality in the art, which is a shame, since this episode is particularly important plot-wise.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to give the best aspect of the show such a short piece of the review, but aside from that one episode mentioned, there isn't much to say aside from the art being excellent.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SOUND -- 8 -- VERY GOOD*\\n\r\nThe sound is not as stand-out as the art but still good. There is some good music, although nothing in particular really stands out. The sound effects are also fine, but again, nothing outstanding. As mentioned, the voice performances are fantastic, which gives a great boost to the sound's score. Because the rest of the sound is otherwise rather average, I can't give it higher than an 8, but it is still quite good nonetheless. I do have one huge nitpick regarding the sound design: there are on occasion songs placed into the background, and the lyrics often clash with the atmosphere of the scene or appear underneath dialogue. This gives this weird feeling where you hear voices but don't understand where they are coming from until you realize they are in the background music. A mostly minor complaint, but it practically ruined one or two scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*ENJOYMENT -- 7 -- GOOD*\\n\r\nThis was one of those shows that rarely gripped me, but also never got bad enough to make me stop watching. It was mildly entertaining throughout, with some fantastic moments sprinkled in with some maddeningly poor ones, but even those poor moments helped keep me watching if only out of outrage, so perhaps they were doing something right. This wasn't a show I ever felt like dropping, nor was it a show I couldn't wait to watch the next episode of.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL -- 7 -- GOOD*\\n\r\nConsidering how badly I bashed the story and many of the characters, even a 7 may sound surprisingly high, but the production values really go a long way in elevating the show's quality. Even the story and characters, while highly flawed, are serviceable enough to be enjoyable. Perhaps the best way to describe Katanagatari is as an aspiring epic crammed into far too short a time span. The anime simply tries to tackle far more than it can handle, from too much dialogue to too many characters to too many new subplots to too many unexpected twists. The show definitely could have benefitted from either being longer or trimming its excess fat. Being longer would perhaps give those poorly-developed, unexpected moments a great chance to become legitimately believable or well-built-up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these plentiful criticisms, Katanagatari is an above-average show. It is beautiful, has some excellent moments, and is generally entertaining. You could certainly do better, and it isn't the masterpiece some herald it to be, but you could also certainly do much worse.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWhat\u2019s more important: the destination, or the journey it takes to get there? If you put every ounce of your blood, sweat and tears towards achieving your goal, and still fail, was it all for nothing? Inversely, if you accomplish all of your goals without breaking a sweat, are you really accomplishing anything? Due to the fact that the outcome of nearly every shounen anime every made is never in any real question what so ever, this is not a theme we have ever seen explored in anime. At least, not until Katanagatari was released. This anime is perhaps the only show evermade that can justifiably be called a proper deconstruction of the modern shounen; it takes the aspects and clich\u00e9s that you would ordinarily assume about a narrative and promptly beats you over the head with them. It examines the inner workings and conceptual concepts of the genre and makes you completely rethink the priorities of storytelling. As if that weren\u2019t enough, it also proceeds to accomplish all of this without sacrificing an ounce of entertainment, comedy, action, wit, pacing, or essentially anything. This anim- \u2026no\u2026 This MASTERPIECE deserves a hell of a lot more credit than it gets, even if it isn\u2019t perfect. Presenting one of my all time favorites: Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\n Synopsis: Yasuri Shichika, the 7th successor of the Kyoto Ryu style sword art, lives on an isolated island with his older sister, Nanami; he has never had any other human contact. One day, the island is visited by a woman named Togame, who requests his aid in her quest to find and collect the twelve legendary swords forged by the master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki. And thus, the \u201cSword Story\u201d begins.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Katanagatari\u2019s storyline is nothing special. In fact, in may take you quite a few glances to realize that there is more to this simple \u201cSword Story\u201d than you are made to initially think. Largely episodic in nature, each episode consists of Shichika and Togame locating and obtaining one of the 12 swords. Conveniently, there are 12 episodes in the show (each of them twice as long as a normal anime episode, doing wonders for the pacing of the anime). Now, that information alone might make you assume quite a few things. However, you\u2019re going to want to take my advice: Don\u2019t. Katanagatari teaches you relatively early on that you should not assume a single thing about it. It is NOT an average shounen. Episode 4, perhaps the most trolltastic anime episode ever aired, is more than enough to demonstrate this. This show doesn\u2019t just avoid its genre\u2019s traditional tropes, it laughs in the face of them. It completely dismantles what an average plot might consider to be important and demonstrates the things that are REALLY important when you are telling a story: Character development, motivations, pacing, engaging dialogue, and much more. It\u2019s genius. Pure and utter genius. Katanagatari makes fun of or completely deconstructs an uncountable number of clich\u00e9s, and yet it always does so with the most impeccable sense of execution and taste. Ah, but I\u2019ll stop clumsily trying to discuss the show\u2019s themes while attempting to avoid spoilers. Let\u2019s get to the other aspects of the storyline:\\n\\n\r\nSomething you will initially notice about this anime is that is has a LOT of dialogue. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is certainly a very fair share of action, but the majority of the screen time is spent showing the characters having conversations with one another. The reason that this is a good thing is because it\u2019s VERY well written dialogue; sometimes hilarious, sometimes deep, but always witty and/or thoughtful. One of the best scripts I\u2019ve ever seen. The emotional highs are high, the emotional lows are low, the comedic timing is flawless when applicable, and the show always seems to know just what to say. Katanagatari covers the entire range of the emotional spectrum; it will make you feel EVERY emotion. I can\u2019t say the same thing for any other anime I\u2019ve ever watched, or at least not to the same extent. The one and only complaint I can make about the storyline is that it gets a bit lax when fleshing out its plot developments toward the end, but none of it really matters in the end. Did I mention that this series has, quite possibly, the greatest final episode in anime history? Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know how to write good characters, look no further than Katanagarari\u2019s incredibly memorable, masterfully written and downright lovable cast. Y\u2019know how Cowboy Bebop became wildly popular because of its ability to introduce new characters every episode and still end the episode arc with them feeling fully fleshed out (among other things)? Well, Katanagatari does it even better. From compelling backstories to unique personalities to complex motivations, the side characters in this show are among the greatest and most interesting in the entire medium considering the circumstances. However, even without them, the character cast would be totally unforgettable thanks to the duo of Shichika and Togame; both of whom are some of my favorite characters of all time. Shichika, besides being likable, is one of the finest examples of character development I\u2019ve ever seen. His thoughts and actions carry unfathomable thematic weight and his personality is unique as well as perfect for the tone of show. Did I mention that he is also a badass? Shichika is quite possibly my favorite anime character of all time; he was written so goddamn well that it\u2019s inspiring. Togame is just as complex as Shichika, but her motives are shrouded in mystery. Really, before anything else, Togame should be lauded for being one of the most likeable characters ever conceived. She is laugh out loud hilarious, full of energy, absurdly adorable, and STILL manages to command the respect of the viewer and be legitimately multi-facetted. Really, I struggle to find the words to do this pair justice. Easily the highlight to an already incredible show, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned that the character designs are astonishingly awesome; easily my all time favorite. What a stupendous job by the writers in this department. The characters stand out as the best part of an already amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nSome people really like the art style of Katanagatari while others dislike it, but I never understood how anyone could possible not think this show looks good. The bold colors and lines are pure eye candy, and I\u2019ve already mentioned that the character designs are the most beautiful, diverse, and creative examples in the industry. The action scenes are animated wonderfully and even the dialogue scenes never seem to lack energy. I LOVED the animation for this show, even though some people disagree for whatever reason. There is much less debate about the music and voice-acting, however, which are both nearly flawless in execution. Katanagatari has maybe the best and most varied original score I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. From haunting and intense melodies with a traditional Japanese theme to the occasional hip-hop track that gives even the likes of Samurai Champloo a run for its money to everything in between, believe me when I say that this soundtrack has it all. The two OPs really aren\u2019t anything special, but Katanagatari re-aired on television in 2013 with a brand new OP, and THAT one is fucking incredible. Probably the most underrated OP of all time, and one of my personal favorites. When it comes to presentation, I struggle to find a single thing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to end this review with a clich\u00e9 (ironically), but I\u2019m going to anyway: This anime will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you feel every emotion in between. It\u2019s intelligent and has tons of depth while being simultaneously entertaining and filled to the brim with charm. If you don't watch Katanagatari, you are doing yourself a major disservice. I highly doubt that there will ever be another anime that manages to balance themes and entertainment as well as this series; it\u2019s one of a kind. Not bad for a Sword Story.",

            "content": "Katanagatari started as a light novel series by Isin Nisio. Who's written nothing else that I'm familiar with. He wrote some novelizations for both Death Note and xxxHolic, but I'm only familiar with the originals for those two and novels based on established series tend to vary a lot in quality. The anime adaptation was handled by the relatively new White Fox studio. They were behind both the Jormungand and Steins;Gate anime, so that could be a good sign. Then again, every studio tends to do some good and some bad work so this could be the first anime they've done that I dislike. Onlyone way to find out. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a martial artist, who incorrectly refers to himself as a swordsman because this anime doesn't know what a sword is*, named Shichika. He lives with his sister in exile on an island. That ends when a woman named Togame shows up and asks Shichika to accompany her on a journey to collect twelve deviant blades. He agrees because he's fallen in love with her for no adequately explained reason. Did I mention he knows her for all of thirty minutes at that point? The story follows their journey to wade through a massive sea of exposition in order to collect the blades. This anime breaks the most important rule of story telling, show, don't tell. There's very little that happens with any bearing on the actual plot. The episodes are roughly fifty minutes long with most episodes using three minutes for the themes, eight minutes for action sequences, five minutes for plot relevant content and thirty four minutes for long stretches of exposition. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that one episode has a twenty minute stretch of dialogue that's nothing but the characters expositing over plot points. Because... showing the information in a natural way would've taken too long? One of the most inexcusable scenes happens in the middle of a fight scene. The characters just stop for more than five minutes so that one can exposit about her backstory. Then there's the narrator, whose only purpose is to waste time by telling you where they are, which they invariably mention in their exposition anyway, or to spoil what's going to happen in the next episode thereby killing any tension before it even has a chance to build. Smooth. The only real exception is the last episode, which spends most of its time with action sequences and a scene where someone, I won't spoil who, dies for fourteen and a half minutes. The worst part is that there's someone around who could've tied a tourniquet or something but prefers to spend the time crying because the first character is bleeding to death. Because.. death is more tragic if there's someone guilty of criminal negligence. The biggest issue that comes out of the whole thing is that it's boring. Stretches of dialogue can be interesting, but they barely have any actual dialogue. Most of it is incredibly stilted exposition, which isn't interesting. Then there's the romance, which never evolves beyond an attraction that comes out of nowhere. Nothing interesting is ever done with it, rather like the anime as a whole. The attempted comedy is so lacking in actual humour that it can be difficult to tell whether something is supposed to be a joke or it's just stupid. Then there's the ending, which features an anti-climax followed by abject stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have the characters. First you have Shichika himself, who calls himself a sword because he formed a club with Gundam 00's Setsuna for people who think they're inanimate objects. He has very little in terms of personality. He's pretty much defined by being stupid, hitting things and falling for random strangers. He's your typical big dumb hero character. Then you've got Togame, one of those characters who's supposed to be clever but never acts clever or demonstrates any intelligence whatsoever. She can be recognised by yelling a lot, falling over, blushing and hitting Shichika while yelling \"cheerio.\" She's a pretty typical tsundere character, except with fewer dimensions. There aren't any interesting characters in this. They just fill their role, spout exposition and then stay stagnant or die. The worst part of it is that they try to have tragic moments, but they've never given you any reason to care about any of the characters so they just fail. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the art. I actually have a few positive things to say about it. The first is that there are some really nicely drawn backgrounds. The second is that the weapons, whether they're actually swords or not, are nicely designed, mostly. Now back to giving discredit where discredit is due. The character designs in this are horrible. The eyes are just off and convey no emotion other than dull surprise, and they show up in spite of being covered by hair on several occasions. The noses appear when the characters are in profile and vanish entirely when they're shown head on. White Fox does know that noses have depth, right? The characters really do look like badly made plastic dolls. The sad thing is that they try to have fan-service by giving Togame the occasional bum shot. Yeah, this art style doesn't work for that. The animation in this is frequently lazy. There are several cases where they just hold on the same image for no reason. The fight scenes are exceptionally bad. The characters are drawn so they're almost never actually coming into contact with one another and there's one fight scene where they play the same animation three times in a row. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is another thing that I'm going to give some actual praise to. The music is well done. It could've made it in a decent anime. Then there's the voice acting. This is another anime where no one seems to be trying. I know that several of the major seiyu can act. Tamura Yukari, Tomatsu Haruka, Okiayu Ryotaro and several others are skilled at their craft but none of them seem to be putting any effort into their performances. Although, to be fair, there are very few people who could sound natural while delivering all of that exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri. \\n\\n\r\nThe final rating for Katanagatari is a 2/10. There's a pretty clear lack of effort on the parts of everyone involved. The story is mostly told through tedious exposition. Character development is absent. The fight scenes, and most of the art in general, are just poorly done and none of the seiyu seem to be trying. In the end, Katanagatari is by far the most boring anime I've ever seen and the few scenes that kind of work aren't worth sitting through the exposition for. \\n\\n\r\n* They refer to Kunai as shuriken and every weapon, from guns to an android, as swords. They even refer to some non-weapons, like a suit of armour, as swords.",

            "content": "I'm actually astounded by the huge number of people lauding Katanagatari as a masterpiece, with high rating of 9's and 10's popping off everywhere in the reviews, claiming that it is perfect/flawless blah blah blah,  listing everything positive about it then exaggerating it further. This makes it appear like it's 10/10 worthy solely from reviews when really, it's far from the truth. While Katanagatari isn't the worst out there which feels mentally violating or makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall or a sharp corner on your table, it is not on the same level as the masterpieces, which feelslike you're having an animegasm or ascending into heaven whenever you watch it. No, Katanagatari is far, far from it.\\n\\n\r\nI'll also mention some other things:\\n\\n\r\n- This is my first review on the site. Normally, I don't bother writing reviews because a lot of what I want to say about a particular anime has been already said in another. Thus, I see no reason to repeat what other people have said. It's also due to the fact that I'm lazy and it's hard to motivate myself to write one. :P\\n\\n\r\n- Characters and plot are heavily weighted.\\n\\n\r\n- Minor spoilers\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - Both 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI don't have much opinion on sound, other the opening being interesting and generally working well with the anime overall, which provides atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art I is quite unique. It's quite similar to the one you would find when you're looking at legends on screen, and indeed, Katanagatari is set during the Edo period, the reign of the Shoguns, so it's definitely good that they've used this style. The scenery is nice, though could have a bit more detail. Colours makes it look more vivid and lively most of the time, yet often dips into the darker shades as well, adding to the atmosphere already present . Characters are generally well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nThe one problem in this area though is that there has been a few cases where the art quality 'drops'. More specifically, there were cases where I've seen still frames and recycled animation used throughout the latter half of the series (often gives a shounen-esque feeling). \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the art is generally consistent throughout the show. It's good to see something new used here that's atypical of anime you see nowadays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 12/30\\n\\n\r\nOne of my first major gripe with this show, and despite it being heavily emphasised through the anime, it hasn't been executed well, regardless of the widespread acclamation that this is the show's strong point.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first failure in this case is the HUGE abundance of characters in the entire show. This isn't bad on its own. In fact, as Monster has proved, such a diversity of characters allow for fresh and interesting situation to rise, while also giving us a new perspective for the story to be told. Given that Monster also had PLENTY of time for development, it felt like each character had a purpose in the anime (Johann being somewhat of an exception, despite him being portrayed really well). Katanagatari did not have that luxury. By trying to shove such a huge cast into 12 45-minute episodes, it has inevitably shot itself on the foot, as the said character(s) don't get enough development, and as a result, are forced into 2 situations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Character feels underdeveloped, akin to one saying something like 'What's the point of this character?'\\n\r\n2. Character's development feels rushed and sudden, not gradually over time\\n\\n\r\nThe former can be said for ~95% of the entire roster. The development on the side characters, particularly the antagonists, are a joke - they barely had any time to develop before they get killed (granted, for some characters, we do see a slip of their past and how that has changed their outlook, particularly Meisai Tsuruga, who deserves some credit, but that's about it). The Maniwa Corps is the main target of the criticism here - every single character has been killed without been given a chance. A whole episode dedicated to them is not enough to be considered developemtn. I had hope for the penguin guy, seeing that he had the most potential, but nope. He dies. What a surprise. Every member of said corporation, and also a lot of the side characters, can be merely cast off with the question mentioned before, 'What's the point of this character? How is this character significant in the anime'? This is what's lacking in a lot of them. Apart from Yasuri's sister, who also received poor development and Meisai Tsuruga, I see barely any point in them. They're just a running gag in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, we get to the protagonists, Yasuri Shichiki and Togame, hailed by many for having excellent character development. Like... what? If anything, only Yasuri gets credit for 'proper' development, though it was one that could be labelled as 'expected' - a machine is expected to transform into a normal human being, in terms of developing empathy and emotion. It's nothing new here. It's uninteresting at best.\\n\\n\r\nTogame didn't really change much, considering how much screen time she had. Essentially, she was emotionally scarred due to a past trauma that left her walking down a path of veangence and looking to carry out her father's wish. As a result, to hide this fact, she puts on a 'mask', a show where she's rather expressive and reluctantly collects the 12 swords for the 'Shogun'. During her travels, she falls in love with Yasuri. However, at the end just before she died, she openly admits WITHOUT hesitation that everything she worked for was for revenge and that she planned to kill Yasuri after collecting the 12 swords (12th is a gun by the way...). Really, all she had done was that she held onto her past trauma, put on a mask and embark onto a journey to collect swords. While all this time, she did not change her mindset... Nice development... It's static.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot - 10/30\\n\\n\r\nMy second gripe with the series. Before I get into a rant, let me say that I consider Katanagatari to have 2 plots at work here that goes hand in hand: Togame collecting swords  for the shogun and the other is Yasuri developing empathy, turning from a machine into a normal human being.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the people who say that the plot is 'so complex', or so 'simple that it's so good' and give a whopping 9 or 10. Like..... No... Just no... No matter how many times I rack my brain, I can NOT understand how the plot is 'complex' as people say (and I do have an eye for subtlety if I focus). Perhaps it was the excessive dialogue that switched me off (more into this later), or perhaps my expectations quickly died out after 3 episodes feeling like a grindfest trying to finish... Only God knows.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand however, the plot being simple does not mean the plot is good. A plot being simple has to compensate in other areas, such as subtlety in thematics or in this case, characterisation. Otherwise, the whole anime suffers as a result. Due to characterisation, its saving grace, being quite lackluster, the plot was forced to suffer.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the sword collecting. While it does sound plain, lame, simple and boring, again, this isn't bad on its own. It had potential to change the direction of the narrative when needed. It had potential to add in twists and turns to keep the plot fresh. What is bad about it however, is seeing CONSTANT repetition of the following formula for 11 episodes STRAIGHT:\\n\r\nArrive at new place -> meet new antagonist -> talk -> fight (?) -> win sword\\n\r\nIt got so predictable to the point where I wasn't expecting anything new to show up. Turns out, from episode 3 onwards, up to 11, I was right. There were no twists, none of that unexpected event that puts you into a state of shock, none of that 'gamechanger'.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecond, Yasuri's development. This one is more important than the sword collecting part, and where people get the idea that the plot is quite 'complex'. \\n\\n\r\nLet me say that having dialogue is fine. In fact, it's quite important, as it fills in the gaps when there's no action in the anime. It gives you an idea of what a particular character is thinking about another. It gives you an idea of their personality based on how they speak and interact with others verbally. However, there is a point where the amount of dialogue can become excessive. This has the effect of making the plot feeling like it's dragging on forever and stagnating in progress. \\n\\n\r\nThat's Katanagatari in a nutshell. There is a plethora of dialogue that shows the interaction between the 2 protagonists. Of course, with characterisation as it's focus, this was bound to happen. They needed to show how Yasuri and Tagome develop as protagonists. This, they did relatively well. You can see, through their interactions, how they change (?) throughout the course of the show. But they went over the top and added more dialogue that contributes to almost nothing. For 45 minutes. There's even dialogue in the action scenes for some reason...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAdditional thoughts - 10/20\\n\\n\r\nThis section covers any additional thoughts I might have about the anime. This includes enjoyment and other comments I might make if it doesn't fit under the other major sub-topics. It also makes up the final 20 points available to bring up the total possible marks to 100.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first 3 episodes, I was drawn into the anime. But the interest was lost quickly due to how repetitive the plot was and how stale it became due to the excess amount of dialogue in 45 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime listed under action, there's barely any actions and those actions aren't really well done. \\n\\n\r\nI would've expected them to choreograph the scenes in a way that looks realistic, rather than being shounen-esque in looks or slinging multiple arms around while the torso remains in 1 spot... Something like the fight scene between Lancer and Archer in ufotable's work Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL - 46/100 = 46% = 5/10 on MAL\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari, the show that loves the number 12. 12 swords, 12 ninjas, 12 episode... and I'm half expecting it to turn out that the Shichika has 12 secret techniques at his disposal. Yes, Katanagatari is an interesting show about a young man and woman on a quest to gather the 12 ultimate swords. The premise sounds fairly cliche, but still interesting enough to watch solely based on that, but how does it really fare? Lets find out...\r\nNow, let me start off by saying, if anime was judged on artistic style alone, Katanagatari would probably be one of the greatest of all time, as the artworkis beautiful. Scenic landscapes, great character design, and a whole lot else to create a beautiful vision before your eyes. The plot.. starts off on a rather simple footing, with Shichika and Togame beginning their journey, but begins to branch out wildly, creating quite a lot of sub plots. And to make things better, Katanagatari does a very nice job of keeping these plots understandable, and doesn't let itself get drowned in side stories. Every episode you can begin to enjoy the very layered plot, starting with what the sword of the day is, followed by what Togame and Shichika's topic of the day will be, and maybe even the back story of an enemy ninja or swordsman that they have to fight. Needless to say, the story is well layered and overall very interesting to follow along. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, Katanagatari seems to do a pretty decent job with them as well. Both Shichika and Togame are rather interesting to watch, and have a strange chemistry that makes you laugh and genuinely bond with them as characters. Each has a back story that even now (5 episodes in) has been looked into a fair bit, but still left in enough mystery to keep the viewer immersed in the series. The series being episodic by nature, has many MANY characters that appear for maybe an episode or 2 before disappearing or being killed. Each usually don't have much of a back story, but often are acted on really well and make one wonder what their life must be like. Overall the cast holds together quite well, with no one being particularly memorable, but nobody being bad by any means.\\n\\n\r\nNow every series has some flaws and katangatari is no exception. Each episode happens to be set for 45 minutes, which helps make the one month wait less painful, but generally leads to a lot of filler. The action scenes are usually pretty short for what they could be, and the characters quite often seem to get caught up in idle conversation... that can be funny at times, but you know its just padding out the episode. Another problem is the release schedule for this anime. Now releasing one hour long episode every month for a year is a pretty unique way of doing it, and sounds pretty cool when they do it, but it really does dowse the overall feel of the series a little bit. One can forget a lot in a month, and usually you don't go into the new episode with quite as much enthusiasum as you might of a month earlier.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, those are rather small complaints. The story is good, the characters interesting, and the show itself works quite well. I'm not exactly a huge fan of the action genre, but Katanagatari definitely got my attention, and I plan to see it all the way to the end, and I recommend you do to.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nI was really excited for this show and hyped for its ending because I had heard really good things about it and its ending. On the r/anime subreddit I go to, people consistently put it up for \"best endings\" or most \"solid arc\" or \"great character development\", but while I liked this show initially, it started to lose its luster a bit with its episodic repetitiveness, long runtime (45 minutes approximately, which I think hurt it more than helped as I felt they rambled too much and could've had a faster pace). Some of the dialogue confused me a bit for thetalking, and I didn't care as much for the historical ties ultimately. The end was also disappointing even though it tied things up a bit at least.\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably because I prefer happy endings, but I was really disappointed with this episode. I think I really wanted to root for the love in this show, between the two MCs and how much they liked each other. I know Togame did some bad things for the wrong intentions, but I wanted her to redeem herself and the two to live happily, because I thought they both suffered enough through their lives and deserved happiness at the end of their quest. In this, even after losing both his family, Shichika is left without anyone close to him, and Togame was a tool until the very end - it just doesnt send the happiest/most hopeful message imo. Maybe it goes \"deeper\" and I miss something, but I ultimately think a happy ending would've been better/fine for this. What was there gained with Togame's death? What does that say about Shichika's and Togame's happiness? What message is the show trying to give with all this?\\n\\n\r\nThe gauntlet was honestly cool but also disappointing. I'm glad Shichika is stronger, but if he doesn't struggle and fight the swords at their best, there's not as much meaning.\\n\\n\r\nI did like his eye change though, and it was heartwrenching, his goodbye. I found his following of Hitei to be ironic and somewhat interesting, but I also find it a bit weird. I don't know if I dislike it or not - probably a little glad he has some company but I'd've preferred to see him and Togame together at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI think overall, this show is close to being good but not quite enough for me and falls as \"above average but not that far above\". I think some of the dialogue at times could be drawn out and a bit pointless (still better than Bakemonogatari but still bad in this), and some of the themes and ideas I just dont agree with. Things like \"be a tool for another and its okay\" or \"fall in love and do whatever the person says\"...things like that are...not good messages for a friendship or relationship, even if they're somewhat humorous and enjoyable to watch. The quirks and stuff for the characters were interesting, but the constant deaths and killings disappointed me. There was no sparing the good sword owners at all, and I didn't feel connected enough to a lot of the deaths ultimately. I'd prefer if the good people could live and find a purpose in life - I think that'd send a better message for the show. As it is, its a bit humorous and entertaining, but I'm not sure its in a way I enjoy as much. \\n\\n\r\nI also felt the episodicness got repetitive after a while - there wasn't that much contuinousness - it was always just find new sword + find new way to obtain sword. Sure, some maniwani and shogun stuff happened in the background and the show tied more things together in the end, but for a good few episodes, it was a bit repetitive and I felt no new spark. And the initial enjoyment I got died out a bit.\\n\\n\r\nSome good things: you did get to see Shichika really develop, and I did feel Togame and Shichika's bond through the episodes and really enjoyed that. I liked their romance, and it had some good humor between the two. It wasn't afraid to kill its characters (but imo it did it in a poor way, without letting us feel a connection. Other shows like HxH have more deaths too but we really feel the stakes more in those deaths imo) and push some common ideas/tropes out the window.",

            "content": "Ok, first of all i didnt get to watch all episodes. the reason im still writting this review is because this is aimed to give a warning to the people planning to watch this show and the fact is that its boring. (reasons below)\r\nanyways im not leaded by subjectivity and this review is done in the most objective way possible.\r\nNow that i said this lets begin with the review.\r\nfirst of all, katanagatari is a show that really attracted me. i mean i looks good, has acceptable number of episodes and the story has potential to good comedy and action. i feel this is the reasonwhy its so overated as you see most of the reviews here have really good scores. my theory is that those are made because people start this show with the illusion its good and keep believing in it cause its potential. however im not.\\n\\n\r\nNow, strong points:\\n\\n\r\n-The art and animations are beautifull, you get attracted to it when you see it and its very easy to get use too for being that unique.\\n\r\n-formula that cant fail: action+comedy+romance usually is the way to go if you want target general public.\\n\r\n-story seems very good. its simple but that simplicity manage to tell you what to expect.\\n\r\n-The actions scenes are great. the fights are dinamic and with cool techniques\\n\\n\r\nNow the flaws:\\n\\n\r\n-Senseless dialogs. huuuge flaw i mean, i feel they went for 45minutes episodes because they wanted to speak more. i mean it could easily be a 21minute episode if you were to erase that. and its not comedy, they try to explain every little thing they do even its too obvious. it really annoys you if 90% of the episode is talking.\\n\r\n-Short action.  for a 45min episode i would expect a good amount of action. however not only the action scenes are very short they are caught between senseless dialogs. \\n\r\n-Bad comedy. really a lot of jokes are just not funny. however they manage to pull out some good ones but screw them out. how would you say? well they take a good joke and talk about it for 10 minutes when the joke just isnt funny anymore.\\n\r\n-having a narrator is annoying to much to explain here.\\n\r\n-Lack of characters. i mean besides the two main characters and maybe one more there are no other characters that you would expect to see in other episodes which makes each episode less related to the previous one.\\n\r\n-the first fight i was really looking for wasnt shown. really maybe a good prank for your cousin but its lame when you expect a good fight and end up with a dialog of how good the fight WAS.\\n\\n\r\nThere may be more to these lists but i state again i HAVENT seen all episodes but i have to say if the first 5 episodes didnt attract someone (half the series) the other half is wasted cause everyone will drop the series before it. so maybe all thsi flaws are repaired in the next half i dont know but if you want to risk and go for 5 boring episodes go ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is an anime that I came to surprise, not to discredit, but the other animated works of Mr. Nisio Isin have seemed very mediocre, under this prejudiced thinking, I present myself before Katanagatari\r\nOh, and there will be spoilers\r\nThe story of Katanagatari is not surprising at all; A long time ago, a sword-maker called Shikizaki Kiki forged 1000 swords, of which 12 are said to be the swords that Shikizaki could perfect; the Shogun wants to recover those swords (after innumerable failures) and for that the Shogun sends the young Togame to speak with the current head of the Kyotoryuu clan, Yasuri Shichika.\r\nThe story, asI said, is simple, but the author knows how to captivate us with the stories of the 12 swords that Shikizaki Kiki forges, I say this because stories are told at the beginning of the story and epics; that a person possessing one of the swords can defeat only 100 soldiers (or more), that the swords are worth more than a country or that many times the government has been betrayed because of the value of the swords. Everything is exaggeration makes you have immersion, it assumes that Katanagatari is not a realistic series, since that would take away the essence to the way it narrates the majesty of the swords, with this point I would like to make clear that all the stories that are told on the swords they help immersion (many will say that I am exaggerating, but later I'll go deeper into that).\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of what I told before, about how the main focus of the story develops (which is the story that the swords and their users keep), now it's the introduction, being honest, the introduction seemed mediocre; the introduction of Togame and Nanami's meddling in situations was pretty bland. Togame explained almost the entire synopsis in about 10 minutes to the protagonist of a very poor narrative, as if they wanted to vomit the whole plot from one moment to another without pauses to reconsider everything heard, not even Shichika came to wonder why Togame told him all, it is true that the introduction gives way to ironic comments by Togame (ironic and cynical comments abound in the work), the reasons that Togame gives Shichika to fight at first are ridiculous, but also try to parody one of the most used topics in stories of adventure or action, shoveling for love.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the first chapter (which would be the introduction) after the 18th minute or so, achieves its purpose, you can appreciate the good animation, the oriental soundtrack that is wonderful in several scenes (special focus to the soundtrack that it sounds when Shichika uses his \"special technique\" to Koumori), he introduces himself to the first enemy dynamically, creating a formidable design for Koumori, besides having many extravagant scenes, like when he takes the sword out of his stomach, if we put all this together we make an introduction that can be very pleasant, the explanations were mediocre, but this is compensated by some ironic comments, the intrusion of an enemy that is not boring, fluid animation and pleasing to the eye and even more pleasant soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are in my opinion a strong point along with the battles, I would like to clarify since each character feels unique due to the characteristic design that each character has besides the exaggeration that they put on many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWith that clarified I would like to talk about the chemistry and dynamics generated by our leading duo; Shichika has an evolution throughout history with Togame, not only can you get to understand a little more about her romance (we must take into account that at the beginning Shichika said that he loved her in a very empty way, but in the end Togame's death caused a great mental shock in Shichika). but is the Shichika evolution well achieved? I would say yes, after Shichika has faced death so many times with Togame it is normal to assume that evolution is credible, this sounds superficial, but let me dig a little deeper.\\n\\n\r\nShichika knows practically nothing of the outside world, he has not even experienced love as such (it is true that he obviously loves his sister, but it is not the same kind of love, logically), the impact of knowing that Togame is the descendant of the person who was killed by Shichika's father causes him to generate a strange sense of duty with Togame, normal taking into account the values \u200b\u200bthat his father taught him, precisely from there arises the seed of a love that at first is superficial and very soso, but through actions and dialogue you can see that their relationship progresses well (take for example chapter 2, Shichika says that a plan to make Kinkaku leave your room is causing the death of Togame, obviously this happens, but then in combat Shichika jumps in Togame's face to defeat Kinkaku, Shichika says that this is necessary, but then does not use Togame in the same way, not even when Shichika is in great danger (in chapter 8, when they face the doll, Shichika never approaches Togame despite that it would do him good to buy time, or in the chapter where he faces Nanami, he gets mad when Nanami cuts his hair). Outside of that Togame at times talks about how he wants to defend Shichika or prevent him from dying at all costs (as in chapter 2, where Togame says that Shichika is not allowed to say his \"last words\" or chapter 9, where many misunderstandings and Togame realizes that he has to act quickly to continue with Shichika). At the end the relationship progresses through the 2 protagonists are knowing more about each other, which is clearly seen in chapter 10, the last cusp would be the last chapter, where Togame speaks to Shichika without fear, without pretense or masks, telling him unpleasant things that would normally be annoying, just to end up saying, can I fall in love with you Shichika? So showing all the feelings of Togame, this is not a deconstruction of their relationship, is what makes it so real, Togamr says absolutely everything to Shichika, but even with that, she could not help telling Shichika that she wanted it, The last thing he wanted to say to Shichika was a demonstration of love, that's in my opinion one of the best-achieved scenes of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that the protagonists evolve in a good way, Shichika goes from being a sword to being a true man and Togame becomes a woman who knew how to obtain her goal in life and knew to know the true meaning of love, achieving that the evolution of the characters complement very well with their relationship, in this section I like the series very much.\\n\\n\r\nRelevant secondary characters there are not many; Emonzaemon seems to me the most wasted, having a decent personality and a potential promising past is only relegated as the princess Hitei's doll, which would be acceptable for the plot, but this fact totally oats the personality of Emonzaemon and makes him a disappointing character , it is not explained why he wants Princess Hitei so much or what happened to his clan a long time ago or because he knows Houou, it is true, Emonzaemon does several tasks to move the plot, but otherwise it turned out to be one of the things disappointing anime, a character with potential and a design that I think is great, at least his death and combat is one of the best in Anime, causing him to die in a successful way.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters that added points to the anime; the first to be Houou, the Maniwa within the story is simply a joke, at first the es\u00f1ectativas are high because the first member of the Maniwa had a sword, but in the second and third chapter a member of the Maniwa is shown only to be killed by the person who has one of the 12 swords, but this is unnecessary because you already know in advance the power of those who own swords, so this does not have much use to the plot (although it must be said that these 2 Maniwa were assassinated quickly had good design accompanied of an abnormal charisma, taking into account that they appear very little), although it sounds like a negative point, in reality the Maniwa are something good that has the anime, it is true that the first seem a waste, but they all have such unique designs, such unique movements and they make them so extravagant approaches that, although they die fast, they manage to be a visual delight, but not only that, I liked the Maniwa, as well I like the jump they have to chapter 4, where Maniwas are shown more human without becoming boring, 3 members are killed by Nanami (the protagonist's sister) and the way he cheered on stage was accurate, beyond being good it was precise, it was played with the unpredictable and they made the 3 most human Maniwas so far are killed in a brutal way, in order to feel sorry for them, the Maniwa won a certain recognition in that chapter, presnetado very well and in a way He needs 3 characters (I love how they used the approaches well to not show the ability of the Maniwa Chouchou and thus hit) that at first glance would seem pathetic, because the Maniwa had only been a punching bag, an excellent demonstration of the Maniwa; similar cases occur later with the Maniwa in chapter 6, 9 and 11 (I think those chapters are) where Maniwas are shown again that if they serve for something and manage to keep the audience entertained.\\n\\n\r\nTalk about the Maniwa, but what about Houou? It is assumed that he was going to speak, Houou is the typical character who does not go for a fixed side and has no clear objective, his actions throughout the history show great determination and the moments in which he seems the plot of he moves in an exact way, his personality is not overshadowed, his struggles are not either, the ironic and intelligent dialogue (for in most of his dialogues he talks about strategies with the other Maniwa) that are used to promote events in a natural way, especially end of the anime, where he gets the 11th sword and causes the complete destruction of the village of the Maniwa (although his combat is not the big deal), Houou seemed to have a past with Emonzaemon, but on Houou's part it is known that he destroyed Much of the village of Emonzaemon, but not much more, on Houou's part this is forgivable, since Houou's motivations are very distant from having to do with his past with Emonzaemon; In short, Houou is a very curious, extravagant character, the character that for me has the best design, one of the characters with the best dialogue and one of those who moves the plot, a character that undoubtedly fulfills its objective in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that caught my attention was the Princess Hitei, it may be that some consider her as the antagonist or something like that because practically his fault died Togame (I take to say that the construction to get to the scene of his death is impeccable), but his role would say that it goes beyond simply being that, the presentation of the character as such is for me a nod, Togame had talked about Hitei a few chapters ago, but had not been seen (also served to get an idea of \u200b\u200bwhat kind of life Togame had before and thus generate more immersion, because not all people can talk to a princess), I would say that Hitei's dialogue is one of the best, his ironic dialogue reveals important parts of the plot in a way in which the spectator is going to take him by surprise (however they are not badly executed or abused situations), a clear example of this is chapter 9 (I think) where Hitei reveals that he is descendant of Shikiza Kiki Kiki ironically and engages in a conversation with Emonzaemon where the interactions are so peculiar that they left me a bit dislocated, but then I immediately realized what was happening, which is quite intelligent on the author's part; also it is worth noting that Hitei is like Houou in the sense of boosting the plot, one of the positive things about this anime is how the vast majority of characters serve to drive the plot, but with Hitei she felt as if she had planned the majority of the events from the beginning, it was very interesting how they explained all this in the anime, even in the end she seems a new person, because she does not have to be tied to the government's mandates and it shows that she pays homage to Emonzaemon (you just have to note that he wears his mask), so I feel that Hitei was a very well-carried character.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of technical issues this is for me a wonder, the scenarios, the changes of planes (special focus in chapter 4), the animation, the color palette and the soundtrack is simply amazing and all this together is even more incredible , everything combines and highlights the right parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy had me a bit doubtful at first, it is true that the dialogue contains comical and ironic moments, but some jokes that are not funny as the joke of the cherio, who never graces grace and when Togame discovers wrong stat the joke is lengthened about 5 minutes, in chapter 9 the sudden approaches in Shichika can cause a bit of grace, since he does not know how to use a sword well and take advantage of that to make jokes about him in chapter; What made me \"funny\" (the quotes go because it was a very special moment) was chapter 4, with the battle against Sabi Hakuei, Sabi is probably the character that has the most baddas design, scenes were dedicated to him in the chapter 2 and 3 where it showed a little of their personalities and skills, all this combined with the fact that it was known in advance that he was the strongest swordsman in all Japan caused me a hype (especially seeing the progress of the chapter 3, yes, here is the special that looks at the advances), to finish off it is said that he can cut the moon, all very epic and if, the battle does not happen, all the stage prepared to make that joke, many got angry, but when I went to capitile 5 the only thing I did when I remembered chapter 4 was to laugh and say \"what trolling took place there\", the joke was planned in a spectacular way, everything prepared just to do that, the best thing is that throughout chapter 4 There is little talk about the protagonist's sister and they are in charge of showing us how powerful she is, in this way they make such a brutal and surprising turn that makes you easily forget the epic combat between Shichika and Sabi. The second best chapter for me without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally I would like to talk about some issues, from the beginning it seemed that history would repeat the formula of a chapter we get a sword and ready, without much depth, but having such incredible designs, scenarios so colorful and varied (besides that most of the swords are different, that is, by God, a sword is a doll and the other an armor), but what I loved was how the different people were different: Past, Personality or simply the way the combat; all that makes the fighting seam unique and fresh (especially the capitilo 2, 3 and 9, which leave a great lesson in Shichika and will serve to mature), so the anime knows how to handle his formula in an ingenious way, it would be stupid resume the series in \"a chapter a sword\", because it ignores all the rest that makes the fighting great.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to leave a short dedicated space talking near the end, it sounds weird, but Shichika in the final chapter reminded me a lot of Gon from HXH in the chimera ant saga, Shichika is someone if I evolve, but it took away something precious, that I caused a shock so big that it clouded the mind, I lost my mind, so I say that is equal to Gon, both lost something precious and then reconsidered and returned to act normal, but with very remarkable psychological sequels, Shichika was angry and showed everything that he learned in his trip with Togame, is even poetic, Shichika ended up in the Shogunate (I think that's what it's called) to lose his life, being that Togame left in that place, who gave him life and to finish in that place he uses all the techniques that he learned with her, I am glad that Shichika has not died and the end is left with that feeling of melancholy for the trip of \"vagabond\" Shichika that (and returning with the comparisons) reminds me a lot of Ken shin by Rurouni Kenshin; the\\n\r\nThe narrator's words at the end are beautiful, I have to say that they moved me (especially when Togame is seen next to a tree).\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion it seems to me that this anime is spectacular, it was a great surprise; he fulfilled expectations that he did not even have (that in itself only makes some sense), he has a few mistakes, but they are compensated in a phenomenal way, an anime I would recommend to friends and remember, not only for all the positive points I mentioned, but Because I will remember the laziness that gave me to see the 50 minutes of the chapter and in the end I always wanted more, that's all",

            "content": "You could pretty much summarize the whole plot of Katanagatari (sword story in English) by it's title. Because, it really is story about two people traveling around japan, collecting twelve magical swords. However, when you actually sit down and watch it, you will probably get more out of it than you had expected. \r\nStory: As I said before, it has a pretty simplistic story. The story follows the 2 main characters as they set out on a journey all around Japan to collect twelve swords. the main focus of each episode is a new sword for the two to collect. When they are not fightingto collect another sword, the characters are probably spending their time talking to each other. This might sound boring, but the dialogue is well written and even really funny at times. Depending on your taste, the fact that the episodes are 45 minutes long, and that a lot of that time is spent on conversations between the characters might be a turn off.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art of Katanagatari is well... interesting to say the least. Its very colorful and eye catchy, this is mainly in part to keep the viewers attention while the characters talk themselves to death. However, corners are not cut when it comes to things like attention to detail and backgrounds. Some of the backgrounds in the show were even pretty darn beautiful. The fight scenes were also done very well, and the animation was fluid during them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: While I don't specifically remember any \"standout songs\" in the OST, the music does fit the shows theme and era very well. It sets the mood of the show and does it's job when needed. The OP's and ED's were also very good. the voice acting was pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Because the show has a big focus on dialogue, the characters that are talking have to be interesting, or else the show would just be boring. Luckily, the characters in Katanagatari are pretty darn interesting to say the least. The two main leads of the show are really neat characters. At 1st they seem like generic anime archetypes, however, they definitely have their own personalities quirks that set them apart from the crowd. Also, they go through quite a lot of character development throughout the show ( Sad that this is a bit of a rarity these days). Most of the side characters are not given enough screen time to fully flesh them out, however they each have their own unique personalities and motives. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My own personal enjoyment of this show is really high, between the witty dialogue and interesting characters, I found that there are almost never a boring moment in the show. However, I can definitely understand why some people would not enjoy this show as much as I did. If you are going into this just wanting a dumb action show (absolutely nothing wrong with that),you are probably going to be disappointed. Also, the sheer amount of time spend on talking, witty dialogue or not, could turn you away. However, if you are looking for something just a little bit different from the norm, then I think that this show has a lot to offer.",

            "content": "==[ Katanagatari - Overall: 9.5/10 | 12 episodes]==\r\nOne-liner: If you want an anime with amazing art, great character development, good romance and an ending which you cannot predict from episode 1, Katanagatari is for you.\r\n[ Introduction ]\r\nKatanagatari, or Sword Story, is about the Strategian Togame and her \"sword\", Yasuri Shichika. The story is about their journey to collect 12 legendary deviant swords made by master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki.\r\n[ Story = 9 ]\r\nWhen I see animes about a journey to collect swords, I generally think: \"Sword fights to be expected. Blood and gore. Severed limbs. Magical sword. Ooooh... Duh!\". Katanagatari is about swords, of course, butnot your run-of-the-mill sword anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo what will you find: sword fights! Duh no. Not many sword fights! But... but! It's a sword anime! Yes, but not so many sword fights. Interesting huh? Romance. Was kind of expected. Lots of lovey-dovey kissing? Nope. It's more of a... weird kind of... love. Comedy. Yes, fair share of good laughs. Plot twist. On the menu too. Main character gets beaten, levels up, gets beaten, levels up. NO! NO! No level up! AT ALL! So awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI found the pacing a bit slow sometimes, with a bit too much dialogue between the characters. A few particular scenes were stretched the limits of my patience. However, one can argue that the slow-ish pace is used to build character. One would be right. Still feels a tad slow at the start.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the story is unpredictable. There are no cliff hangers! No cliff hangers! In a modern anime, can you imagine? All episodes are basically stand-alone except the last two. I really liked the story. It's simple, really. But it's so well narrated that it doesn't feel simple at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is unpredictable, but each episode follows a certain pattern. Tip: There are 12 Deviant Blades. There are 12 episodes. See a pattern?\\n\\n\r\n[ Art = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\n9.5 really. The art is not your classic anime art. It's hard to describe... Don't expect big anime eyes. Don't expect anime expressions. Ok maybe a few. Don't expect anime faded colors.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you should expect are vibrant colors that look like pastel, well-designed character models and excellent backgrounds. It's one of the animes you can watch just for the characters and art. Definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth, well detailed - even fight scenes. Costume design is especially great. I liked how Katanagatari shifted from \"known and tried\" art to something interesting and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nFor some people, the art and animation can feel slow and simplistic. Almost un-moving. For me, that's what makes the beauty of Katanagatari. Remember, it's a sword anime. It's supposed to have fast animation! Explosions! Clash! Not a relaxed animation!\\n\\n\r\n[ Sound = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\nUhh.. if you read my reviews, you'd know am not really good at rating sound. For Katanagatari, I'd say the music really fits the situation, and the episode intro music (very Samurai-ish) was really nice and mood-setting. Haha... Sorry. Not very satisfying huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is a bit wordy. I didn't mind. The background music helped with that.\\n\\n\r\n[ Character = 9 ]\\n\\n\r\nAhhh the major attraction in Katanagatari: characters. It's one of the animes I've watched where I truly liked the character development. It's slow, methodical and done in great timing. Nothing is revealed too early. Some things are not revealed at all. No plot holes, I think.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is only 12 episodes, but it has a ton of characters. Thankfully, the two main characters: Togame and Shichika are explored in depth, their relationship getting major screen-time. Their journey together and interaction gets much attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are all unique, and I can't say I've found their similars in other animes. Like, Katanagatari features ninjas. You'd think, yeah, black-outfitted ladies and dudes with masks. HAH! Think colorful animal-themed clothes instead! Also, they all have their own stories and it's not just insignificant stories; sometimes their stories do play a major role in the episodes. They're all likable, even the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting part? There are no bad guys! None of the characters are portrayed as \"bad\" or evil. There is no arch-enemy. Even the character you think are bad guys are only trying to get their share of the action. They have their own reasons and their own troubles. As another reviewer mentions, you may even come to like the \"bad\" guys...\\n\\n\r\nSadly, there is not enough character development. Some of the characters' stories are not explained at great length. The episodes are 50 minutes each but you'd still feel like the side characters are not explored in enough depth. Example? The Maniwa Corps. The background story of their members are hardly explored. Same for Shichika's sister. Shichika's mother is not mentioned at all. Togame's background story is breezed on, and I still don't completely get it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, good main character development, interesting character relationships, good character background-stories, likable and memorable characters but unfortunately, not enough in-depth exploration of each character's story.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment = 9.5 ]\\n\\n\r\nI really liked Katanagatari. It even made it to my Favourite Animes! So what did I enjoy?\\n\\n\r\n- The art. I really liked the pastel-like colors, the feeling like everything is drawn on paper. Really changes from the \"normal\" animes out there with big sparkly eyes etc.\\n\\n\r\n- The story is not what I'd expected. There are a few plot twists and \"wtf\" moments which spice up the plot. Good pacing. It never feels too rushed. Except maybe last episode which I think should have been a bit longer, say 20-25 minutes more than the other episodes to completely wrap up the story.\\n\\n\r\n- The characters: A very nice, likable set of characters. I also enjoyed how each had an elaborate background-story.\\n\\n\r\n- The relationship between the main characters. Not what I'd expect in an anime like that. It's just fun! I.e. the non-fighting parts of the anime didn't bore me. Also, I did say there are not that many extended fight scenes overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I DIDN'T enjoy:\\n\\n\r\n- Not much I should say. Am quite satisfied.\\n\\n\r\n- I wanted some characters to be developed in greater depth. E.g. Shichika's sister who is just... unimaginable!\\n\\n\r\n- The anime is a bit wordy. LOTS of talking. I didn't mind that, but you may so am listing it here since people complain about it.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall = 9.5 ]\\n\\n\r\nGood anime. Very, very easy to overlook. One hell of a lost opportunity if you do miss it. If you are on the lookout for an anime with distinctive art, good character development, an interesting story, a good bit of romance and an ending which, in my opinion, fits the anime, then check Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nOh and... CHEERIO!",

            "content": "Finally, the cross-genre blend of Jidaigeki and Hard-Boiled Mystery the world has been clamoring for.\r\nOh, well apparently I have to write a longer review to actually submit it so I can't leave it on just that note, but Katanagatari is exactly what you're expecting when you hear the phrase \"Nisioisin does a swordfighting series.\" \r\nEvery character, all the way down to the most minute, single-scene appearances, are fleshed out and eccentric in their own ways, with backstories and special powers and character arcs to keep you thinking about them long after they (for the most part) are torn to pieces. Half the series is justcharacters in conversation, and a few of them exist mainly to break the fourth wall or to deliver critical exposition. It's a giant chess game between protagonist Togame and antagonist Princess Hitei, and most of the plot is obscured by the fact that these masterminds are withholding all the information from the cast (and from us, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe story, a journey to collect twelve swords with twelve strange superpowers, really is just a mystery novel every episode; the goal is absolutely not in delivering a story that works on suspense and twists and turns, and instead gives us puzzles to solve-- how does each sword work? How the heck's Shichika going to defeat his opponent this time? Because of the amazing cast of characters, this formula works really well and compares favorably to similar defeat-a-bunch-of-eccentric-villains stories (e.g. Scott Pilgrim, Ninja Scroll).\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is primarily a comedy, working on silly circumstances, weird punchlines, actively making fun of the viewer (you'll know the episode when you see it)... but once again, the cast makes the emotional moments really work. Almost every character has their own arc, their own development, their own tragedies. Their paths collide, people die, and the story moves on, but it's continuously a sad, lonely journey for our two protagonists even as the story keeps the tone light. Balancing the jokes with the legitimate emotions is a tough one, and just like with the Monogatari Series, Nisoisin's writing pulls it off. Somehow.\\n\\n\r\nArt style is lovely, a mix of cute and cool that plays to the mix of drama and comedy that I just talked about. The animation is iffy in places, no more than any other TV anime, but kinda noticeable here when every episode is a full fifty minutes each. The fight scenes, luckily, are all great. But you'll definitely notice some cheap animation techniques, a lot of still frames where a bigger budget would have been a lot more dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, some of the episodes, especially later on, really didn't need that hour-long episode time and you really felt that they could have mashed a couple of the stories together without losing anything. Still, nothing was egregious and there were not noticeably poor episodes out of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say Katanagatari is a masterpiece of television or anything, but it sure got pretty close to being a true epic, and one that could only be done in the world of Japanese animation. Watch this if you're into good television.",

            "content": "Yo boys, you should totally watch this series!\r\nHowever, by that point you'll have been torn to pieces.\r\nDear those who want to watch Katanagatari...\r\nYou may have witnessed a lot of disappointment from those who watched this show. The main reason (and sometimes the only reason) behind these instances of disappointment is the extreme lack of action. People start watching this show expecting high octane martial arts fight scenes filled with badassness, but really, that's not the focus of this show at all. Instead, what people get is talking. At least 90% of this show is just pure dialogue. \r\nI was one who knew about this dialoguething before I watched the series, and not because others told me about it beforehand, but because I noticed that this show is the pinnacle of the anime medium, a LIGHT NOVEL ADAPTATION! And who is light novel by? By none other than Nisio Isin, who is well known for the Monogatari franchise. If you keep in mind this fact, starting this show expecting anything other than talking is stupid in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nSo why do I love Talking: The Animation so much? It's simple. Katanagatari may be the least boring anime that I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe Monogatari series makes dialogue fun to watch in its own unique way, and that is SHAFT VISUALS. Through the constant transitions of scenes, imagery, weird poses and head tilts, the dialogue becomes bearable due to the weirdness happening around it. Katanagatari doesn't do this. When people talk, it just shows their lips moving real fast, with a couple of facial expressions here and there to spice things up. What makes Katanagatari's constant dialogue not boring is the sheer quality of the dialogue. Full of wit and borderline Gintama levels of self-awareness, the interactions and conversations that the characters have are just simply... entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThere have been moments in almost every anime that I've watched where I had to check to see how much time was left in an episode, even in thrill rides like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Even despite the 50 minute episode length, this has never happened once during my watch of Katanagatari. 50 minutes just pass by in a flash, to the point where I watched 6 episodes in one day and had to force myself to take it slower. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, I can't mention Katanagatari without mentioning the incredibly unique artstyle. Katanagatari is drawn like a Japanese painting, and while some may think that this classifies Katanagatari as an artsy show, it really isn't. It's just a simple adventure filled with wonderful character interactions. It doesn't have the incredibly deep themes, mysteries, and other philosophical ideas like other artsy shows, such as the Tatami Galaxy and others.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is the story of Katanagatari? It's basically a fetch quest. Well, I actually like to call it the epitome of \"It's about the journey, not the destination.\" These are words that I've always lived my life by, and Katanagatari expresses it very well. The fact that the show focuses more on the character interactions, no matter how insignificant, rather than making a complex story, is basically telling you to enjoy all the things in between, not the beginning or the end. The relationship between Togame and Shichika is also a great example of living the present, while putting aside the past and future. I would go into more details, but that's spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what else about our dynamic duo? Well, they are dynamic. In fact, they are probably the most dynamic pair of anime protagonists that I've ever seen. Togame and Shichika have incredibly contrasting personalities, to the point that they are almost polar opposites. This makes their interactions, both little and important, very refreshing and enjoyable. Shichika is emotionless, but not like the Kuudere type of emotionless, but like the innocent child who knows absolutely nothing type of emotionless. He also delivers a lot of punch lines, albeit unintentionally. Togame sets up all the comedy between them with her self centered and confident attitude, only to have her confidence shattered in the most hilarious of ways. Did I mention that this show is self aware? It really is. Togame almost breaks the 4th wall so many times, which I absolutely love. I really can't go into detail about their development together, so all I will say is...\\n\\n\r\nI love the way they loved each other.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that noitaminA opening? Absolutely EPIC!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Cheerio!",

            "content": "Katanagatari was a series that got a good deal of hype back in 2010 that I never found myself getting into at the time. Notable in that each episode aired one time a month on Japanese pay-per-view channels throughout the year and each one aired at 50 minutes a piece, the series focused on skilled martial artist Shichika and a military adviser named Togame seeking out the whereabouts of 12 legendary swords called the Deviant Blades created by a recluse swordsman named Kiki Shikizaki, as each episode of the series focuses on our pair trying to seek out one of the 12 weapons. Shichika andTogame aren't alone in this task as two other parties are trying to lay claim to the Deviant Blades in the form of a clan of ninjas called the Maniwa Ninja Corps and a princess named Hitei who is rival to Togame.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is different from typical feudal era titles in the fact that there is quite a bit of creativity put into the journey faced by Shichika and Togame. While the \"collect them all\" storyline with the Deviant Blades may seem like typical fare, a number of the weapons are not swords in the typical sense as some of them take on unique forms and many of them even have unique abilities that complicate the mission of our main pair in trying to collect them, especially as Shichika is not allowed to inflict any kind of damage to the Deviant Blades as he tries defeating their wielders. Some of these confrontations involve typical battles where Shichika tries to defeat their wielders, while others require him to get more creative under Togame's guidance to defeat them if conventional tactics aren't doable.\\n\\n\r\nThe series balances out its focus on the quest to gather the swords by offering solid exploration of a number of its major characters. Our lead pair and many of the Deviant Blade wielders get a good deal of focus in Katanagatari's unique run time as many of the latter group are focused on to explore their backgrounds, mentalities and why they wield the Deviant Blades they have possession of.\\n\\n\r\nThe unique pairing of Shichika and Togame lend a mixture of both comical and serious developments in their relationship and offer a fun foil to one another with Shichika being naive to the ways of the outside world in spite of his immense skill in martial arts and Togame trying to put on a regal facade in spite of her lowly status with the shogunate and her ability to develop tactics when confronting Deviant Blade wielders. Their chemistry is a genuine one as Shichika learns to develop a sense of self through his understanding of the outside world through Togame and our female lead grows to admire Shichika in spite of her original intentions to utilize his skills as a tool to gather the Deviant Blades for her personal gain. The series does drop hints of the two having a past connection to one another through Togame's rather tragic back story that are eluded to as the series progresses and helps add some engaging drama to the pairing's developing bond in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPraises aside, I do have some issues with Katanagatari that hurt its quality to an extent. For anyone familiar with series creator Nisio Isin, you may remember his work with the Monogatari franchise. Much like that series, Katanagatari often likes to indulge in dragged out conversations between characters that cover ongoing elements of the show's plot and characters. Unlike the Monogatari franchise where this presentation approach worked because of the series being more character-driven, the heavy focus on conversations don't work as effectively at points for Katanagatari since the series is more plot-driven and causes the pacing of the series to often drag.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also has its bumps with characterization. While offering solid character depth with major players of the plot, there are some that don't get as much depth such as a number of members within the Maniwa Ninja Corps and Hitei's assistant Emonzaemon. And speaking of the former, their effectiveness as a threat in the hunt for the Deviant Blades diminishes quite a bit as the series progresses since the majority of their members get killed off rather easily in later episodes through Shichika and a few other characters.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Katanagatari is a bit of a mixed bag. While having beautiful background and scenic shots, character designs are a bit on the simple side sporting minimal details and facial designs looking rather out of the ordinary compared to more conventional designs. The series doesn't show off fluid movement often. But when it does, it creates some engaging action scenes that sport great choreography thanks to the unique abilities shown of the Deviant Blades and other fighters throughout the series, that include use of weapons, exotic abilities and hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some elements of its premise are a bit flawed and I do find the show's praise to be somewhat overhyped, Katanagatari is still a unique offering for a recent series offering fresh approaches with the character chemistry between Shichika and Togame, its \"collect them all\" premise and its feudal era action. Anyone looking for something different compared to many recent titles should give this title a shot.",

            "content": "I watched this anime approximately 5 years ago, and in the light of having just finished rewatching, I decided to write a review (or at least to attempt doing so.)\r\nKatanagatari is a story about the Strategian Togame and her sword Shichika, as they travel across all of Japan to collect a series of swords called the 12 perfected Deviant Swords. Each episodes deals with a new situation and new characters that each help develop the relationship between the two main characters, from that of Master and Sword to a more personal friendship/relationship. Especially Shichika goes through a huge change from an unemotional weapon, to anactual person with individual feelings and thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I love Katanagatari and it's by far my favourite anime. The story and characters had such a huge impact on me and the further you watch in the series, the more fond you become as you join them in their journey. During the 50 minutes of an episode, there isn't particular focus on only the fights, but also relies on a lot of speech, comedy, and a few romantic scenes between the two main characters, without seeming too much like fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nI LOVE Katanagatari, because of the way it isn't like a typical  anime. It doesn't contain ridiculously long fighting scenes, and even the characters that only appear for one episode are thoroughly created and have their own reasoning and/or background. They aren't just characters there for Togame and Shichika to surpass, they also help them develop and they each stirred some kind of emotion in me. The music perfectly fits the story and I love how it creates a great atmosphere fitting each scenes. Along with this, the music is a bit odd/different in the same way as the art style, so they go hand in hand with each other. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to pretty much everyone. Unfortunately those I told about it, refused to watch it simply because they disliked the way it was animated, which is a ridiculous reason to miss out on such a great story like Katanagatari. So if you, reading this, thinks this too, I have just one thing to say to you - you're an absolute idiot and you're missing out on a masterpiece because of your picky taste.",

            "content": "Monster of the week, unconventional love story, or a sequence of intriguing but longwinded dialogues, Katanagatari is certainly all that, but also much more. Superficially, it is a series about a simple-minded, albeit unconventional, \u2018swordsman\u2019 who battles for the twelve swords under the enlistment of an even more eccentric \u2018strategist\u2019. Underneath the seemingly clich\u00e9 premise however, the series has buried within it all manner of artistic treasure: cleverly designed, high-tension action scenes; a subtle love story, nearly imperceptible during its incredibly moving, gradual evolution; and perhaps most infamously, eloquent subtext conveyed within the lovable idiosyncrasies of the characters\u2019 quite expansive conversations. Rarely has a showhad such lengthy yet engrossing dialogue sequences, especially ones so utterly diffuse in their emotional and intellectual potency as these.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari has a simple structure. Each episode we are invited to watch our lovely couple trod to the next blade wielder, devise a strategy, and invariably defeat them before they grab the goods. If this encompassed all there was to the show though, it would be certainly not be worthy of the praise and admiration I am so aptly about to shower it with.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple minded Shichika begins the series as a\u2026 dull character. He replies blatantly to questions, and due to his ignorance of the world outside his island, these answers are often unexpectedly lacking in social understanding and convention. Ominously pointing towards a highly grating and redundant protagonist, these first impressions are dissipated rapidly as experience of the world refines Shichika\u2019s internal ideology, without washing away his accustomed roots. His grasp of the world, while na\u00efve, is nonetheless insightful and grounded in a sound logic that turns out quite wholesome and compassionate in its essence. A refreshing change from the often one-dimensional, \u201cI\u2019ll be the very best!\u201d attitude the standard shonen lead possesses.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the reason for Shichika\u2019s remarkably enticing character stems directly from our oh so terribly clever female lead, Togame. Always prepared with meticulous counterarguments to all possible holes in her complex machinations, these become hilariously misplaced when used on our completely oblivious male lead; It\u2019s a definite high point of the series. Togame\u2019s labyrinthine thinking plays well off of Shichika\u2019s simplistic personality, creating a combination far greater than the sum of its parts. As the unlikely duo encounter each blade wielder, it is consistently the coupling of Togame\u2019s quick ingenuity with Shichika\u2019s fighting prowess that makes the  battles so enthralling. Neither alone has the capability to win each of the fights, quite a contrast to shows where one of the leads is delegated to the background, the mere caricature of an equal teammate. In Katanagatari, neither character jumps above the other, the radical equality a wholly satisfying change from the usual paradigm. As the show progresses, their chemistry shifts unnoticibly from a faint background atmosphere to a highly palpable ardor, each battle entangling them ever further into an altogether quite intensely gratifying relationship.\\n\\n\r\nUsing a simple animation style that mixes bold colors, bold calligraphic lines, and whimsical design, the animators created a one of a kind setting for the series, a creative blur between childish and mature, historic and fantastic. Add to that a grandmotherly narrator who introduces us into each week\u2019s episode, her wise yet light hearted tone endearing us to watch the young couple more attentively, almost as if to say that we are becoming their hopelessly overbearing parents. Vibrant modern interpretations of Japanese folk music ties the whole package together, with a wide selection of tracks unobtrusively creating the well balanced \u2018old meets new\u2019, \u2018simple meets complicated\u2019 atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Katanagatari comes together effortlessly. The viewer left feebly unable to explain its appeal precisely because it is so finely woven as to have its individual strengths rendered indiscernible. The backdrops of history, simplicity, and tradition interweave seamlessly with creative battles, intricate plots, well developed characters, and a myriad of fresh ideas. All this happening in progressively more and more captivating episodes, and then culminating in an exceptionally visceral, emotional ending that may leave you, as it did me, completely breathless. Highlights include scenes from the shocking and highly entertaining episode four, the tragic and tense episode seven, the mystically profound episode ten, and the entire final episode, which had me absolutely absorbed from the first scene to the wretchedly bittersweet finale. It is unlikely you\u2019ll find a more unassumingly brilliant series than this one in any given year of watching anime, and I couldn\u2019t recommend it more.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nFor such an inconspicuous series, it\u2019s unlikely you could do much better. Katanagatari gets my highest recommendations due to its exceptional quality from start to end, perhaps even tantalizingly heightened with moments of true masterpiece.",

The art is a little different from what one might have become accustomed to in 'mainstream' anime, in that it looks vibrant, and daresay whimsical, but it absolutely gorgeous. Every moment of animation in Katanagatari is brilliantly drawn and fluid.\r\nThe soundtrack, composed by Iwasaki Taku (Soul Eater, Gurren Lagann) is matched to the actions in wonderful form, and his work is as excellent as ever. The pacing is fun, with a good balance of humor, drama, and tragedy. From beginning toend, the journey featuring the two main characters is something enjoyable. The art may be a hurdle, to begin with, but the show is definitely worth your while! Let's also not forget that this is brought to you by Nisio Isin, author of Bakemonogatari and Medaka Box, and while this piece certainly isn't as ridiculous as either of those, it's a brilliant display of his work in animated form.",

            "content": "This anime is beautiful,  I don't really know how else to describe it.  \r\nEven after watching the entire series the second time through, It's difficult to articulate my thoughts about watching this. The quality put into each show is amazing, as I believe it was released monthly, with each episode spanning around 45 minutes. Katanagatari does a good job telling a folktale-like story which is compelling and intriguing. It takes place in a post-Sengoku era, aka the post-\"warring states period\" in Japan,according to wiki. \r\nIt's a story about the journey of two people, who were perhaps destined by fate, to travel together andcollect 12 unique swords which each contain mysterious power, be it benign or supernatural.  It focuses on their adventure traveling together throughout Japan and the mysterious encounters they undergo among the people who either foster or are hunting these swords simultaneously.  Underneath the surface of their journey, there is an underlying love story and a gradual development of character between the pair.  It is progressed with each successive encounter throughout the show, which is done is a very stylish and majestic manner.   \\n\\n\r\nThis show is extremely charming.  The style is unparalleled, and is befitting to the mini-culture portrayed throughout the show.  I can understand the art being a hit or miss with some, but personally it was like looking at beautiful art.        \\n\\n\r\nIt is not an action packed show filled with meticulously animated fight scenes, although there are plenty of badass moments.  It is just a simple story that is filled with memorable moments via a well written script.  I remember vaguely reading somewhere that this was based on a light novel.  Either way, while watching the show I definitely felt like I was reading a good book rather than watching a generic show.  There are strong but subtle emphases of destiny, history, geography, and japanese culture in this anime.  Furthermore, the show is paced well as each sword is generally obtained per episode, in various ways which all lead to finding to resolve to fight.             \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is amazing, and is definitely in my own personal top 10, maybe even top 5 I've ever watched so far.  \\n\\n\r\nThree things I love about this anime:\\n\\n\r\n1) The music. There were probably only 1 or 2 times where I felt the music did not suffice, or was apropos.  Other than that, the music is top notch.  It gives you the feels.  It's unique, I would bet some are made with some pretty old-school instruments specific to Japan.  Violins, are also a  welcome in any show.\\n\\n\r\n2) The love.  This is a great love story.  It's the type of love where it develops & changes the character's perspectives within the show gradually.  It's done tastefully and with class.\\n\\n\r\n3) This show is very memorable.  It is a stand alone story with a conclusive end.  There will be moments where you will get immense feels, accompanied with amazing music feels at the same time.  If by the end of the show you don't get any feels, you are most definitely a robot.",

The MC starts off rather interesting and then i found he turned boring as he is super OP but i still think about the end of this show to thisday.\\n\\n\r\nI have been struck by the beauty of the animation, kissed by the story, and awe struck by the ending. I would recommend this to anyone any day. It has good feels, tears and uncontrollable smiles at the end \\n\\n\r\nthanks for reading my terrible attempt at a review \\n\\n\r\nMaYo",

In the end I decided to divide this review into two, episodes 1-3 and then 4. \r\nUp until episode 4 Katanagatari was pathetic,\r\nTo begin with the ART\r\nOh god the art, others who have watched this anime will claim that in spite of all the downsides including the dumb story, the pathetic characters and substandard mediocre villains, viewers will claim the artwork is amazing.\r\nIn one of my favorite arcs in Naruto, the developers used a similar animating style with a very powerful effect.\r\nArt work of this type has one point it really shows the explosive intensity of the conflictto great effect as in Naruto. Katanagatari FAIL.  \\n\\n\r\nLimping along to the characters, the guy who has lived on an island his entire life, has a penchance for maple leave styled haircuts and skirts who is at the same time the comedic relief and the Warrior , the other is the other character that happens to be female that isn't interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe final stinging point of Katanagatari is the plot line.\\n\\n\r\nThe story heads in one direction, but it's like looking down a very long highway that you can see the end too, it might meander a bit , but eventually it will go right to the expected destination and still suck.\\n\\n\r\nThen I watched the fourth episode, and all of a sudden you realize how deep and dangerous this world is, it is plagued with decay, frustration, sadness and death, and all of a sudden what was simple straightforward and seemingly designed for children became virulent hateful and murderous.\\n\\n\r\nAll of a sudden the character I believed to be the comic relief shit character I started to realize is a prisoner of his own mind... there is depth, and it has built up behind a horrible horrible wall and when the truth smashes it's way out I want to be there to see it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are few animes that force me to wait for the episode in some state of anticipation, but I'm really looking forward to the next episode.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is one of the more intelligent anime out there. Along with Tatami Galaxy it spread light over the otherwise dark year for anime 2010 was overall. It constantly builds up your expectations and makes you think you know what's gonna happen next, then proceeds to surprise you by doing something different from what you were expecting, and then laughs at you for thinking you figured it out. When it wants to it can also build up a peaceful atmosphere similar to the one found in Mushishi. It also contains a handfull of kickass action scenes, a refreshing art style, well developed characters, a uniquestory and some of the best, most well crafted witty dialouge seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the many highlights found in this fun, weird package of a story. The male lead, Yasuri Shichika is definitely the most developed of the bunch. He starts off as the typical loveable but naive guy arcetype, who has lived on an isolated island his entire life, only knowing two other humans, being his father and his sister. You get a feel for him and you start to think you've figured him out. But after a couple of episodes you'll notice how he slowly but surely gets accustomed to living amongst more normal people. His development is really well handled. It's not so subtle that you barely know if he's changing, but neither, apart from a couple of times, is it completely spelled out for the audience. Other fun characters include Emonzaemon, Higaki Rinne, Togame and Tsuruga Meisai. Instead of explaining them I'll just say that they're all very witty and a ton of fun to watch and you have to experience them yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Katanagatari is probably its weakest point. The character designs are indeed unique, the backgrounds pretty, and the art directing beautiful, but the actual animation, the motion of the characters is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand the fight scenes, while short are very well executed with good choreography, smooth movement and high detail. But then on the other hand for basically any scene that isn't fighting or otherwise vital to the plot the movement is stiff and miniscule, though with good storyboarding, directing and constant dialouge Katanagatari does a great job of masking it's lower budget and it doesn't feel cheap and is ever hard or unpleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a very talking heavy anime, and I'll just say that if you don't like that style of show, then well... Get over it! You'll like this one.\\n\\n\r\nAs for other things and stuff: There's no dub, but that's okay since the setting doesn't really fit a dub either, and the Japanese voices are very good either way.\\n\r\nThe music is quite good, reaching a wide variety of musical genres. It even features the choir from the original Ghost in the Shell!\\n\r\nSound effects range from eargasm quality right down to a point where it almost feels like a parody of 90's shounen, probably because that's exactly what it feels like. They also do something fun with the animation and change it a bit each episode, most noteably in episode 7 which was the episode that really got me to liking this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Katanagatari is a fun show, that constantly ridicules other anime, you and even itself. There are so many fun little details in this very rewatchable, enjoyable nice bundle of an anime. It has romance, action, shounen-like hype moments, witty dialouge, enjoyable characters and heck, even a bit of parody. Definitely not something to miss.",

            "content": "\u201cPeople who work for money are no good. People who work for honor are also no good. That leaves only one reason. People who work for love can be trusted. Yasuri Shichika\u2026 fall for me!\u201d - Togame\r\nKatanagatari is written by the well-known author Nisio Isin, original creator of the \u2013monogatari series. This means that, if you were expecting a show with a ton of fighting, you might be disappointed. There is, however, at the very least one (pretty epic) fight throughout every episode. The runtime of each episode is 50 minutes, and I believe that this is beneficial to the series, since it allows forboth more dialogue and character building.\\n\\n\r\nThe story:\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story is quite simple. Because of events roughly 20 years before the story starts, Yasuri Shichika father, and his family, was exiled to a small, isolated island. After his father passes away, Shichika is now the seventh head of the Kyotoryu (bladeless) Sword Style. Enter Togame. She wants Shichika\u2019s help in collecting the 12 Deviant Blades, the final masterpieces of the master swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cOh god,\u201d you\u2019re probably thinking. \u201cThat just sounds so bland! There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll like this.\u201d But I\u2019ll stop you right there. The power of the show isn\u2019t in the story, like it is in some. The characters are what really bring out the goods in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari features a wide array of characters, and somehow, most of them don\u2019t fall into some trope or cliche. Each episode focuses on a wielder of one of the Deviant Blades, and even though we only get 50 minutes with each, they all seem fleshed out and realistic, almost to the same level as series like Cowboy Bebop and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood does it.\\n\\n\r\nYasuri Shichika is one of the most well-developed characters in any anime I have seen. In the beginning of the series, he might come off as someone that would fall into the airhead trope. He even states it himself, \u201cI\u2019m not very good at thinking.\u201d The thing is Shichika has only ever had contact with three other human beings. You come to realise that there is more to him that just being stupid, and he only seems that way in the beginning because of his life devoid of social contact. Important to Shichika is the reason he fights, and this is where most of his development comes. But I honestly don\u2019t want to say anything about it, since it would be venturing into possible spoiler territory.\\n\\n\r\nWhat places this anime as my favorite is not only Shichika\u2019s development, but also the dialogue between the characters. It wouldn\u2019t be a Nisio Isin anime, if more than 50% of the screen time was talking, would it? The banter and dynamic going between Togame and Shichika throughout the whole series almost reminds me of something out of S&W.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Sound\\n\\n\r\nIn my very biased opinion, this show features some of the best character design I have seen. Each character is unique and interesting. None of them are bland to look at.\\n\\n\r\nStudio White Fox did an absolutely amazing job animating this anime. Yup, White Fox, the creators of series such as Steins;Gate, Hataraku Maou-Sama! and Akame ga Kill! All things I feel pretty safe assuming you\u2019ve at least heard of.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari has what is probably one of my favorite OSTs. It\u2019s huge, and has everything from great battle music, to some kind of Vietnamese rap thing , and even to calming, tone setting melodies. \\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really want to say too much about the show, since I believe that coming to some of the conclusions I have come to is part of the watching experience. So go watch it. Like, right now. Go. Do it. You know you want to.",

            "content": "Please Read whole review before deciding if its not helpful and also iam sorry if i spoiled something or didin't write much because i don't want to spoil anything. My Apologies for many grammar mistakes.\r\nStory: Katanagatari is about  full of comedy swordplay which takes place in  Edo era (17th - 19th century) there we got this deadly sword style called \"Kyoutoriu\" but this style isn't an ordinary sword fighting which we see in every swordplay animes this fighting style doesn't use swords in fact the ones who know this style can't use swords because they doesn't know how. 1st episode takes us tothis inhabitant island in which \"Kyoutoriu\" style master was banished with his whole family after some time he died and left his son as the head of the family and a successor of \"kyoutoriu\" style his name is (Yasuri, Shichika) he lives on this island with his younger sister (Nanami). One day unknown woman who calls herself (Togome \"The Strategist\") enters the island in search for master of \"kyoutoriu\" style the banished warrior ... but it didn't go as she wanted. Later on they talk alot and after the whole talking , explaining things they enter into action zone which takes place another half of the episode. Action seems pretty interesting because fighting styles ar not so plain ... Bare handed battling , cutting ... is pretty awesome. After the fighting ends there are some comedy moments which changes the mood from fighting to laughing ... or something else. They leave the island leaving (Nanami) alone and up to the journey!.\\n\\n\r\nArt Style: Well its something different from what we see in every anime we watch ... it takes some time getting used to this anime Art Style. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Well about sound nicely done sfx in battles with all the drums and such sounding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At the moment i'v seen only few characters from the cast Yasuri, Shichika - who is kind of dull at life and can say such words as \"i love you\" or \"I'v Fallen for you\" out of the blue... , Togome \"The Strategist\" - who is clumsy and has superior character which you can see from such words as \"Love me love me all you want\" and etc... And also Nanami - who is as i think kind of weak girl but from what she speaks \"That child is weak how they are going to succeed?\"(Nanami talking about Yasuri) it seems she is stronger than Yasuri Shichika... There was also this \"villain\" supposed ninja ...   who had unique fighting style and etc... don't want to spoil...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well this anime is enjoyable with all the fighting and comedy elements ... jumping from seriousness to comedy ... but despite all that there is a let down ... and it is talking just too much of it ... even in t he middle of fight they just stop and talk talk talk ... that was the only annoying thing...\\n\\n\r\nOverall anime is pretty good at the moment if it doesn't get bad later on... If you got time you can watch it but remember one episode is 50 minutes ...",

            "content": "This anime deserves a full masterpiece rating, the story and how they bind you to the show. How they get you involved before you even realize it, you feel drawn into the show and like as if you're experiencing this journey with the other characters. There's so much fucking talking you can't help but feel that way in this show. \r\n  The ending is done and binded perfectly, almost like a puzzle. Ever piece is enjoyable and nice to watch, but when it all comes together its so perfect and amazing. You can't help but feel drawn in to the story andhave connections with the characters. \\n\\n\r\n  Sigh anyways I'm gonna warn you all before hand, these are messages I sent on various sites (such as youtube) releasing all of my emotions at the spur of the moment, I have officially finished this anime for around an hour now but at the time I had literally just finished it. I will definitely (75% chance) be editing this if I don't feel too lazy, (that just dropped it down to a 30% chance). \\n\\n\r\n  What I'm about to paste onto here is essentially my review of the show but without any grammar editing or any cutting of any unneeded info. I did not edit this, nor did I or am I going to change anything. If I do edit this I will be simply making them into paragraphs and cutting out unnecessary or repeated words (like I did just now). \\n\\n\r\n  But right now its 430 am and school starts in 3 hours and I'm tired as shit. I like my review as it is, so I will not be editing what I am about to say (paste) but more so the details. This is also essentially three different parts of the review posted all together. Each one being extremely long. Which is why I will edit this later.\\n\\n\r\n And without further notice, here it is. (part of what I said here by the way is what I say later on, so you have just read part of my review for katanagatari right now. On further note. This little introduction will be deleted once I finally edit my final review for katanagatari. This is simply notifying you why this will be so long and crammed)\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n1st post \\n\\n\r\nJust finished katanagatari and demo if you're reading this.. I just wanna thank you, that was by far one of, no, it was my most favorite anime that I've seen in my entire life. I don't even know how to describe it at this point, it left so many feelings that now, with such a perfect ending, such perfect words to the very end, I literally feel nothing... I'm sure this sounds sorta familiar. Relating to the show of course. This was one of, no, it was the best anime of all time. There is no denying that. Such a perfect ending, I heard one time that shows are determined by their endings, and if that's true, then katanagatari is truly the best show there is. I don't know what else to say. That anime has left such an impression I don't even know what to feel anymore. Like as if my emotions died with the anime. I've never felt this way before. What am I to do? I have no idea anymore....\\n\\n\r\nThis is alI I can say about the show. It feels as though you pour everything into it and once it goes away so does everything you poured with it. It draws you in, grabs your attention, and makes you feel a part of it somehow. It makes you feel like you were part of the journey the whole way through, with the narrating and the story, with the characters and their interactions. The ending of the show makes it poured into perfectly, with the words that are chosen, the narrating in the background, the affects of \"reality.\" Everything being thrown away. I can't say much without spoiling it, but it wraps things up perfectly and there's simply no way to deny that this was one of the best shows that, no, it was the best anime that has been made so far. Its story, its characters, its narrating, its action. Everything about it was simply amazing and draws you in. There's no way to feel for the show on the last episode. There is nothing generic about this show. They saying what makes and breaks shows are the endings of them, and if that's true, then katanagatari is one of the best shows ever created.To the very end this show makes a huge impact on you that you simply can't resist. Once you watch this show, you will have started a full dive into a show that will completely draw you into its world and leave the impact of things behind. Once you do this, be ready for a joy ride of one of the best shows ever. Because currently, right now, I say with great meaning, I can not feel a thing right now after pouring everything I had into that show. You may not know what I'm talking about, but once you see it, you will understand completely what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\n  I make this a strong claim, it is one of the best (only stating it like this now realizing you can't compare oranges and apples) that has ever been made. It makes this show great, and its ending is truly one to die for. It's priceless, and if you haven't seen this anime you must, if you call yourself a true anime fan then you have to watch this anime. Or else you will be missing out on the greatest one you have yet to witness in your entire life. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n2nd post\\n\\n\r\nEverything seems to be placed perfectly and nothing seems to be out of place. Like as if everything was just fitting so straight into a puzzle board that it almost looks likes as if they weren't individual pieces and for this show once all the pieces come together it becomes a perfect show with a beautiful ending. There's a lot of things to think about and listen to (CUS THERES SO MUCH FUCKING TALKING) and that can be a let down for some. But fear not cus don't worry this show isn't an anime that you need to repeatedly watch. I watched this show in chunks and I found it to be a beautiful and amazing show. What makes this show great is that every episode is a fleshed out story and the ending simply puts it all together to make it one of the best fucking puzzle pieces that you've ever seen in your entire life.  The ending has so many plot twists and everytime you suspect what's going to happen something completely different happens and that's what truly makes this show amazing. You feel drawn in, and almost feel like you're gonna go into that world but at the same time you don't even realize it. There's so much fucking talking that before you know it you feel drawn in to it and like as if you were actually a part of it. But every show is like a whole fleshed out story that it doesn't need to be felt as rushed or anything of the sort. Warning though, on the last two episodes, you will definitely watch them in a pair or I swear to god you stubborn little faggots if you don't I will not let you live, anyways, enough cruelty, the show's amazing in how it brings everything together, and the ending is stunningly beautiful in the way it's done it's hard to say that there was a better anime than katanagatari. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of spiritual messages and meanings in the show and it's not necessarily a let down, in fact it makes you feel as though the show's starting to get deeper and make you start thinking a lot more. Like as if it's letting you know \"we're done dicking around, it's time to get serious and for you to start thinking because shit's about to get real.\" and it really does. With the introduction of new characters (which is every episode) especially in the last \"Few\" episodes. It makes this show great and spectacular in every way possible. You feel a connection with the characters before you even realize it and before you know it, bang. Shit starts to fly and things start to happen, this is when you feel the true essence of katanagatari (oh god like what demo said that feels so good to write) and there's no other word for this show other than spectacular. Everything is placed perfectly and there's nothing out of place or distorted. The show doesn't take any wrong turns and keeps a forward and straight path like a good show should. At the last episode, it binds you so perfectly to the show, you can feel everything that's going on and it ends up being one to feel and remember about for your whole life. I know I had just finished this anime but I have never felt a feeling like this, it will truly carry on with you for the rest of your life. There's so many spiritual and thought provoking messages in this show it can't be helped but to rethink your life one way or another after you're finished with this show. There's nothing else to say about this show, its simplicity, its style, its fighting, its art, its story, its ending, its characters, its development, its narrating, its all put together perfectly and wonderfully to make one of the best shows that you will ever see. There is nothing more to say about this show, if you don't watch it, you are truly missing out on anime all together. Because as I might say, this show, is one of, no, it is the best show that you will see in your entire life. How this show binds together, is mere perfection. There is no other word to set apart this show. How the story is put together, how it brings you along on the adventure with the characters, how it pulls you into the story, how you feel with the characters, this show is nothing but true perfection.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n3rd post *This one is a huge spoiler and if you are for some reason still reading or have skipped the others, then I beg you not to read this post.\\n\\n\r\nI keep rethinking the scene when he remembers Togame and when she says \"let the match-\" which then proceeds to remember her all throughout his year of time spending with her. And it's done so perfectly and without rush that you can't help but just feel the emotional impact of it. I feel this weird feeling, almost like my heart just got damp and heavy and I've never felt it before, maybe its sadness...? I've never felt such a strong connection to a character before I wouldn't know what to think of otherwise now that I've felt it for the first time.. I don't know what to feel, other than what I'm feeling right now. How he closes his eyes, then proceeds to remember the one person he's ever cared so deeply for. He remembers everything that they've done together in no specific order and it leaves such an emotional impact behind that you don't know what to do with it cus you've never felt it before. The impact is so strong you almost feel like abandoning yourself from the dull realization of life. It's so petrifying and horrifying how things turn out for her that you can't help but just feel these strong emotions when you're hit by them. Even her final words were done beautifully as a plot twister, you don't know what to make of them but even so you still love her as a character because Shicika loved her for that. It refers back to the past with her, his life with her, even as he strikes saying \"cheerio\" at the end or says his catchphrase. How he eats at the same shop they've always eaten at, how he tries to draw Japan. Everything about it is done so perfectly and well with enough time given into everything you can't help but feel attached to this show. This show, is pure perfection. It's completed.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hmmm I wasnt so sure about this one. Overal I think it was sort of enjoyable.\r\nThe pacing was far to slow! I mean it. i went for this anime because of the promise of action and decent martial arts fight scenes, well i got them, but usually they lasted little under a minute and all the other time was taken up with pointless chatter and conversations, carried out while the characters looked on emotionlessly, promising death or injury without even the minutest change in their expressions. Anyway the fighting, I usually skip forward when watching something that bores me and because of this I veryoften found I had to go back and find the fighting bit again because even if I skipped only a few seconds forward i would miss it, I actually skipped whole episodes threw sheer boredom.\\n\r\nAnyway thats what I think of it, I found that some people liked the dialogue and I found, when I could be bothered to actually watch those bits then it was quite good, but im personally an action girl and the sheer amount of dialogue just ruined it.\\n\r\nAlso the voice of Nanami (shichika's sister) was so increadible annoying I very nearly gouged my ears out, just the pitch and the way she generally spoke was enough, in my opinion, to cause wide spread mass suicide if heard on speakers of any kind! :(",

This is not some another action anime, this is piece of art.\r\nClosest thing one should compare this show to is Samurai Champloo, not only because of the samurai theme but the main \"plot\" of traveling and finding what was lost is pretty similar, but where Samurai Champloo ends in story and character progression, Katanagatari only starts.\r\nSo much development in only 12 episodes (50min) is incredible. Characters are deep and are presented through very long but sensible dialogues. Manypeople say that its boring and there is very little action. But thats the point. This is show about human soul, about meaning of one existence and his place in the world. Action parts are just for background and progress of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThrough the show and collecting all of 12 deviant blades you will reach final episode and find yourself with the heart shattered to pieces only to be little by little again put back together but you will never see this show in same light again. I could mumble about how much of masterpiece the ending was and how the final fights was so much of a enjoyment, but one must see it for himself to truly understand that.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is not here to spoil anything or to give you some opinions on visuals or music, its about expressing how much of an emotional impact had it on my person and how it should also change your view on your everyday life, even if a little.

            "content": "Anime these days tend to lack a key ingredient, that could very well make or break the series. No, it's not fan-service, nor is it a kick-ass OP theme. It's depth.\r\nKatanagatari, or \"Sword Story\"  strayed from what is now the norm in Anime, and managed to create a masterpiece. Of course, some may not see Katanagatari in such a way, but one should also stop to consider that you don't need hot anime girls to make a series interesting. \r\nSTORY - 9\r\nAt first the story would seem like your average \"collect all the weapons\". And for the earlier part, it would seem so. However,as the story progresses, the story gets deeper and deeper. It baits you in with a promising start, and build that up as you go. Be ready for a lot of twists, comedy, some romance, and some epic fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, being based on a light novel series, this story is very dialogue heavy. Think along the lines of Bakemonogatari, or even Spice and Wolf. Saying this, the conversations are not boring at all.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Katanagatari very unique. The characters are really fresh to look at, and the scenery is superb. The art is also very consistent all through out 12 episodes (which were released a month apart from each other) so yeah. \\n\\n\r\nI don't believe there was a moment that the art disappointed me. The movements were very fluid and well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for Katanagatari is basically...badass. We've got mellow tones, to fast paced music, all used to match the scenes mood.There was never an out of place score in it. A special mention here is the track they use in a majority of the fights, it sets up the mood really well. If you want, you can try to hear it for yourself. Just look up Bahasa Palus.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was great. They conveyed emotions very well, and trust me...there's a lot of emotion here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10\\n\\n\r\nI believe this is what makes this show what it is. The main cast are all very unique individually. We've got an expert strategist, partnered to a swordless swordsman (right?) fighting with professional Ninjas and what not. It's a wide and very colorful cast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is done very well, as we see the main character, really mature within those twelve episodes. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I don't prefer the\"one episode per month\" in anime, I didn't mind it on Katanagatari. It gave me something to look forward to. And it never disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episodes has it's laughs every now and then, but it also manages to mix it up with it's seriousness at times. It's a perfect balance really.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is one of those anime that's easy to overlook, but hard to forget as well, truly a hidden gem for some. \\n\\n\r\nIf one were to give it a chance, I'm very positive, they will not regret it.\\n",

            "content": "I hate Katanagatari, I hate it so much that I cannot describe how I hate it.  I guess that it is time to stop reading synopses, because it never helps you and makes you decide the fate of the anime that you are about to watch beforehand. Katanagatari is one of these horrible examples: it shows you its synopsis, makes you think that it is generic and dull, and then it proves you that it is one of the most epic adventures that you will ever see in your life. When you see it, you will be surprised how masterfully Katanagatari reworks all clich\u00e9smaking it a very unique and unusual fable.\\n\\n\r\nI am sure that all fans of Ninja Scroll, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai Champloo, and Bakemonogatari will find many things to love in Katanagatari. For those who are familiar with Rurouni Kenshin, Katanagatari is its twenty-first century equivalent, but it focuses more on the dialogues than on anything else. Of course, it does not mean that Katanagatari has no action, it has it and it is so beautiful and elegant that no words will describe it. However, if you are a fan of Bakemonogatari it will already give you a guarantee that you will like it, but if you still have not seen Bakemonogatari, Ninja Scroll, Rurouni Kenshin, or Samurai Champloo yet, do not be afraid to give Katanagatari a try. \\n\\n\r\nSo, without further ado, the story of Katanagatari tells us a story of a powerful martial artist Shichika and a self-proclaimed genius strategist Togame. The two should collect twelve unique swords, known as the \"Deviant Blades,\" for the shogunate. But all these blades that the shogunate seeks to obtain already have their owners, which means that Shichika will have to obtain these swords by force. Everything seems to be easy; however, our heroes will have to overcome many hardships and the most important part of that will be the fact that there are thirteen swords. What hardships are waiting our heroes and what truth hides behind the thirteenth ultimate Completed Deviant Blade? That is the question that you will have to answer. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the story of Katanagatari is not flawless. But the only obvious flaw of this anime is that you should be very attentive and you should put up with all these dialogues. That is the only problem of this anime; I cannot even call it a problem, to be honest. Of course, if you try to marathon Katanagatari in one day, you will not like it. But I would not even call it a problem, watch it little by little and you will surely enjoy it. I mean, the final episode will amaze you.  It is worth it!\\n\\n\r\nThe weirdest thing about this anime is its animation. Saying that the animation is unusual will be the same as saying absolutely nothing. All characters look a bit cartoonish; however, at the same time, you understand that it is actually beautiful and you like it. Perhaps, the only two things that will stay in your mind about this anime are its ending and animation. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is definitely memorable. With every episode we see new ED themes; however, I cannot say that they are memorable. The background music; however, is very appropriate to the Edo period depicted. You might even find something new for your collection. And of course the best part about sound is all that tremendous work that the voice actors invested in this anime. They did one hell of a job and because of that their characters are very enjoyable to follow. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this series is another reason for you to watch Katanagatari. At first, all characters look familiar and you have a feeling that you have already seen them somewhere. I would say that this feeling might be annoying for one, but after some time, you understand the uniqueness of all characters. I think that the fact that Katanagatari reworks all clich\u00e9s making itself interesting and unique is very commendable.  And it was possible thanks to the talent of the person that created this anime.  Hopefully, there will be more anime that will be able to do so. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Katanagatari\u2019s cast consists of: main characters, Shichika and Togame, villains, and supporting characters. While the main characters and the villains receive enough development and are very interesting to follow, the supporting characters; however, leave much to be desired. I cannot criticize them that they are weak, but I think that they should have made them more interesting to follow. Yet, the main heroes and the villains compensate well the supporting characters, so I hope that it should not be a problem for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe main heroes of this anime are Shichika and Togame. Togame represent the brain of the duo, while Shichika represent more a blunt strength than anything else. Togame constantly rants about things and tries to change Shichika and Shichika tries to follow his new companion\u2019s orders. For those who have already seen Spice and Wolf, the duo presented in Katanagatari is very similar to what you have already seen in Spice and Wolf. The only difference; however, will be the fact that Shichika undergoes more development than Lawrence. I cannot say that I am a fan of romance; sometimes it becomes boring a way too fast. Shichika and Togame; however, are more a comedy duo than lovers. But at the same time, the chemistry between them is amazing. It is never annoying and it only makes you worry about them more and more. After some time, you just understand that if something bad happens to them, you will be in one big depression. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains of this anime are another thing, which is worth mentioning. They are, mostly, the wielders of the \"Deviant Blades.\u201d Either bad guys that only seek for power to achieve their goals, or people corrupted by the power of their swords that have lost their purport of life; the villains of this series are definitely splendid. But, as I have already mentioned, the supporting characters are just bad. I believe that they should have paid more attention to that part, which is, in my opinion, very important. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I give this anime a very-very-very weak ten out of ten. This series is able to surprise its viewer, it has many aces in its sleeve, hence ten of ten. Of course, there are flaws and you will surely find things that you would like to change. Katanagatari does not deserve the title \u201cthe best,\u201d but it does deserve the title of \u201cone of the best.\u201d For those who like very unusual series (Samurai Champloo), epic journeys (Spice and Wolf), do not hesitate to give Katanagatari a try. However, I am insisting on the fact that you should not marathon it. Of course, if you are a fan of Nisio Isin, or just a hardcore anime fan, you can marathon it, if not, I would not recommend you to do that. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that you will like Katanagatari!",

            "content": "(4.0/10)\r\nDisclaimer: Not huge on anime as a whole + stopped at 4th episode (although that's a solid 2 hours watched). \r\n_______________________________________________________________\r\nI'm not sure what to say. When i first saw that the show had 50 minutes long i was hoping that that means it won't be as rushed as a lot of the anime that i've seen. A constant issue plaguing anime is that episodes often feel rushed due to their run time, ESPECIALLY introduction episodes which try to cram every single plot device and character introduction into one short edible twenty minute bite.\r\nSo this was 50 minutes, and i'm like, \"fuck, ok, lets seewhere it goes.\" And i did. What i got instead of quite literally forty of those fifty minutes being infected with another annoying anime trope. Over-explaining shit that doesn't need to be explained in really really REALLY obvious and clunky exposition scenes, relying on scrolling still-images to save budget. \\n\\n\r\nSo we have a pretty environment with OK character designs sitting around a table talking about something that i'll forget about in a few episodes only for it to flash back to that one scene of them talking to remind me about it (why even include it in the first place?!). \\n\\n\r\nThis sitting and talking about backstory rather than developing anything in a natural and interesting way lasts forever. So much so that the person i was watching the show with were just zoned out completely. \\n\\n\r\nSo finally when the action began and the generic anime concept of \"the introduction episode MUST have an action scene to establish the characters\" was in full bloom. But i thought, \"well, they just talked for thirty minutes so MAYBE this action sequence is where the first episode budget went.\" \\n\\n\r\nNope. Nope nope nope nope NOPE. \\n\\n\r\nInstead its fifteen minutes of this villain character doing more clunky exposition and backstory for the shows backstory (MORE BACKSTORY PLEASE FOR FUCKS SAKE SHOOT ME IN THE BALLS NOW), and when it finally ends the actual fight lasts for around ten seconds and he gets dealt with immediately. Fuck. Me. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe next episode will be better?\\n\\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't, not really anyway. Once again we have a litany of backstory we couldn't give less of a shit about. I won't harp on this, but this is something that occurs throughout every episode i've seen. Just constant backstory. CONSTANT. About character we meet and they leave within the episode! This isn't good interesting character development that gets you attached to someone who might die! Nope, its literally just procedural paragraphs upon paragraphs of one character explaining to another character \"things\" about \"stuff\". \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about these characters. We have the character trope that anime just loves to kick in our faces, the \"New to the whole 'living in society' thing\". That's because they have to deliver backstory somehow! And when the character asks \"What's 'this thing'\" The other character can reply in some long drawnout... thing... about what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have generic tsundere. A white haired \"cute\" character, by \"Cute\" i mean \"Cute\" in the way anime thinks something is cute. So... horribly incompetent in everything and slightly competent in something else. And because she's tsundere she's unbelievably selfish and unlikable and i wanted genghis khan to be a character in this show cause then we'd have a chance to see her get impaled on a fucking spike. \\n\\n\r\nEvery other character is someone introduced into the show to leave (so far) by the end of the episode. They either die or survive. All i know is that they they are there to deliver more backstory about swords and whatnot. There's no emotion behind it because \"character developement\" in this show is just \"hey, here's some backstory about the character... PLEASE LIKE THEM PLEASEPPLEASEPLEAKJLDFJ;AD;KLJFAJKFAJADJLKFA\". \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOverall. Its bad. Not VERY bad. But bad. Its a bad show so far. I don't really want to watch any more of it but i might because perhaps it actually gets good! \\n\\n\r\nMore offensively its not bad like a generic harem is bad, where you sit there and laugh at how fucking retarded and pandering whoever wrote this is. Its bad in the sense that its fucking boring. There was effort in the creation of the story, but no effort in delivering this creation in a compelling way. \\n\\n\r\nFuck.",

No secondary story feels like a filler, and almost every character is believable and fully formed.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship seems to be constant and reliable, but as we get to understand Togame's history and motivations more, the terms of their contract and feelings for each other are revealed to be more complex and far more delicate than we are led to believe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not perfect, each character's journey gives a depth that builds Katanagatari as a whole up to a really enjoyable, surprisingly poignant story, occasionally hilarious and ultimately heart-breaking.",

You might not like artstyle or story based of your own preferences, but even so you jsut can't deny its good. Story is set in medival Japan, yet it has nothing to do with real history. It follows Shichika Yasuri and in general his story is almsot the same with every shonen protagonist. But that doesn't make it any worse. His growth as a character is seen in all 12 episodes of epicness. (BTW, he's not a bitch-protagonist, like a shonen character, so you don't have to see same thingover and over again). You may not like my review, i am not really skilled with words, but i absolutely would recomend this series to anyone, who's not against fighting in anime.",

            "content": "Well, here we go...my first review, I'll be going right to the point, not going to summarise the series as it's in the description.\r\nThe story has surprisingly little action especially considering the fundamental concept is action-related and could of potentially been made into an action anime. Instead it relies on the story telling, plot and dialogue to maintain and create its appeal to the audience. Because of this, the sheer amount of dialogue makes the physical action appear non-existant. This could be a 'turn-off' for some however the script is necessary for the story development. The simplistic plot and structure allows for flexibility and createsunexpected plot twists, and does so repeatedly.\\n\\n\r\nThey art style could initially be uninviting towards some viewers, but once you grown accustom to it you sink into a unique pictorial book. The animated picture book contains simplistic characters set against a characteristic background.The motionless background acts as the stage for the crisp and fluid animation. \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players\". \\n\\n\r\nNot much to mention about the sound/music, as it is pitch perfect. The instrumental melody harmoniously dissolves into the world of Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus is less on the idea of becoming 'stronger' and instead takes on the concept of 'growing and maturing'. With Shichika starting as a character oblivious of the outside world and its morals, changes with every sword he collects. Togame herself goes through characterization from her egocentric personality to an extent. But of course to achieve the final goal, becoming stronger is a prerequisite but is almost second nature to Shichika due to his natural talent. Togame and Shichika integrate with one well another forming a pleasant and entertaining relationship which blooms throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe long dialogue which shadows the action could be off-putting for some, but those who manage to stay with it are rewarded. The art and sound are the highlights of the anime, but the art may take some time to get use to. The characters themselves are unique and complement one another well. The basic plot itself isn't the most interesting but it is transformed into something bigger and deeper.\\n\\n\r\n \"life is a journey, not a destination\"",

            "content": "I will say at the beginning, sorry for the terrible English! Now, about Katanagatari... (without spoilers)\r\nI don't really know what to say, since it has been a long time ago, since I saw an anime this good. I should start at the beginning perhaps. Despite Katanagatari is an action anime, I warn everyone beforehand, it has a LOT OF SPEAKING and fights even though they are epic, they usually last only a few minutes. So if someone expects a shonen anime, don't even being it.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe plot of Katanagatari is really simple. The protagonist, Shichika is a child in a family using a really interestingmartial arts, called Kyotoryuu. Basically, he is a swordsman without a sword. Since his father took part in a rebellion, he was exiled on an island. Where the story actually begins, the parents are already dead and Shichika is living alone with her sister on the island.\\n\r\nOne day a mysterious girl appears, who invites Shichika to find 12 swords of a famous Blacksmith. Basically this is the plot. 12 swords, 12 episodes, 12 months. (Katanagatari was aired one episode/month)\\n\r\nAfter this each episode will have the same structure. They find the sword, then they get it. It doesn't sound really interesting, but since every last sword is unique in it's own way, it will be more, than interesting. And what I really liked, that in those few times, when the main story gets boring, the creators put in some really good secondary storylines, like the one with the ninjas, or the relationship between the two protagonists, Shichika and Togame. (this can be called a main storyline though)\\n\r\nThe story is really epic, full of twists, and the ending is pure perfection, in my opinion at least.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking the art style is really strange, some may even call it ugly. I did so too. It was a mistake. Now, that I think about it no art style could match this anime more well. I liked how they could play with even the small things, for example at one point something will happen and a certain character's eyes will change form due to that incident, and just with that minor change they made the character have an absolutely new aura.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done, the OPs and EDs are good as well and the OST is just perfect. Epic when it has to be, funny when it has to be, sad when it has to be. Simply really well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRight now I'm not talking only about the two main characters, but also every last secondary one! Almost everyone has a unique background, we get to know almost all of the characters, their desires and so. I can't tell more without spoilers, just trust me. The characters are great. And the chemistry between Shichika and Togame is something, I haven't seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every minute of it. I can't say more, siince this is already the border of pure personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would say Katanagatari is a perfectly done anime from every aspect. Also this is mabe only my opinion, but every episode of this show discusses some really deep psychological topic, like friendship, love, power, sibling love, family, pride and so on. But I would repeat once again, this anime is clearly not for everyone and this is absolutely not a common shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nGreat story, beautiful art, beautiful OST, good voice acting, well written characters, totally enjoyable and it even teaches you something about the world, you're living it.\\n\r\nAt least give it a chance, I hope you'll like it as much, as I did. :)",

They are scouted by Togame, who is off to seek twelve deviant blades, in order to gain status and whatnot. Togame is someone who has been betrayed many times, due to money or power. The difference with Kyotoryuu users, is that they seek none of that. Togame convinces Shichika to fight for her, for a reason that he can't betray her with, love. With the power of \"love\", they venture on a slow paced journey to seektwelve blades, following the pattern of one blade acquired, and one enemy killed each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe last episode was really nice though.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nKatanagatari has unique art. It uses ancient japanese styled backgrounds, but they look rushed, and at times look lousy. It's especially noticeable when compared to the characters which are drawn sharply and fluidly. The characters also have really interesting eyes. I like them.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe sound used throughout the anime are fitting, but they aren't very memorable. There's that one soundtrack that raps which was interesting, but overall, the soundtracks were just decent. The opening and ending also weren't that great. They sound pretty intense, but don't match the slow paced story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nI loved the main characters. They developed pretty naturally throughout their journey, and they have an interesting relationship with each other. They say they're in love, but Shichika's idea of love is so damn innocent it's almost a joke. And that's cute. As for the side characters, they were kinda come and go, one dimensional fillers. Except for Chou-Chou and the bird lady who was kinda hot :(\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. They characters were cute and it was fun watching them develop throughout their journey. The fight scenes were also pretty damn cool. It was too slow for me at times though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nIt's slow paced.\\n\r\nIt's based on development of Shichika and Togame over the story.\\n\r\nIt has interesting art.\\n\r\nMain characters are cute.\\n\r\nAction scenes are cool.\\n\r\nLast episode was not a disappointing climax.\\n",

            "content": "The lessons learned every after episodes, the promises were all rejected and the sweetness we were forced to believe as the series progresses was made bitter. 1 - 1 = 0. Zero lessons. though there is something that is gain from this, and that is hate, for the time wasted, for making fun of its viewers. \r\nThis is deus ex machina. I searched the meaning for double checking and it is definitely this. If writers like rising up emotions to their books, stating them poetic or artistic, then sure. But if terribly done? Then surely, it can turn the sudden twist from a good review.I will not judge the book but the anime. The deus ex machina in it showed something unintelligible, I assume to garner action to its duel, for the kids I think, believing them better. less is more. They shouldn't have done that. \\n\\n\r\nBut what I'm so riled up about, again, refer to the first statement of the review.\\n\\n\r\n== Story ==\\n\r\nIt is episodic. One by one gathering swords. It was interesting and made me to continue. The lessons were real. But was spoiled, deceived, and wasted. I will spend a minute cursing the producers. The promises, sweetness.. gone. The dialogues are long, though quite intrigued by them most of the time, and for some, there were scenes where it should be appropriate to just say a word or two or none at all. If you aren't patient, this isn't for you. (I should have read some reviews, tsk, and maybe I could have been hinted and perhaps, I could have unmasked this terrible of a series.) The ending coalesce with the whole series, but the execution was rotten. There were more when there should be less. Action, promise, dialogue. and the lessons, was all undone.\\n\\n\r\n== Art ==\\n\r\nrealistic? unique? fitting? fluid? background? designs? character similar?\\n\r\nIt doesn't possess the ordinary art that is usually portrayed in anime of today, and so I have to say it is unique. But I think it was most appropriate to the genre/story. The actions cannot be belittle. It was mind numbing. Fast and real-time.\\n\\n\r\n== Sound ==\\n\r\nMusics enter in appropriate situations, though in my taste, too much. It is like frequent enough that you can guess when it's going to enter, and it is always bad when it comes to predictability. The voices was appropriate to the characters, the heroine for its perkiness, and the hero for its calmness and dependability. The opening and ending was golden. I couldn't say it was catching but it readies the viewers for the eventuality that is expectant of series, and the closing of curtain at the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\n== Character == \\n\r\nI liked both the lead characters, the hero and the heroine but was ruined in the near unexpected... . Lessons learned, supposedly, promise stated, broken eventually. There is a narrator, an old woman I think, which is appropriate. the voice depicts a fragile sense, just like the fragility of life easily put out. Both are great at what they do. Ninjas are like clowns in their costumes and contrasts the seriousness of their scripts.\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment ==\\n\r\nOverall, let down by the series. It felt lessons, all of it, were undone. Made me think it was no point. It's like letting a girl go to die in another place, or choosing between the life of your girlfriend and mother. I did not enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nps. If by chance of another me from an altered dimension visiting, and happens to read this review, do not, I repeat, do not watch this series.\\n\\n\r\nburp!",

            "content": "Katanagatari tells the story of Togame and Shichika in their quest to collect the 12 Deviant Blades.\r\nStory: (this section contains spoilers)\r\n  The initial premise is a good, but difficult one. Even though these are 40 minutes long episodes, having them collect one sword per episode (and kill a Maniwa shinobi) can make things difficult in terms of pacing. \r\nLooking back, the early episodes where they gather a sword without any further significant plot development were pretty dull. The best ones were plot heavy, namely episode 7 and the last few episodes. \r\n  Because of that time frame, there was very little time tobuild up hype. For instance, Enzaemon and Houhou's blades felt much more important than all others just because they first appeared a few episodes before their own. In comparison, the first blades felt insignificant. If not for their reappearance on the last episode, they would be completely forgotten. Same goes for the Maniwa heads. Some of them (of course, Houhou) like Pengin and Oshidori were memorable because we see them for a while. While most of them die in the episode of their first appearance. \\n\r\n  Long story short, half of the blades, blade guardians, and shinobis were completely forgettable and added little to the plot, yet represent half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the second half of the show is when things get better and better as the characters that got built up time matter more. Plot wise, the show's second half is excellent, much better than the first half. And I have to say, I was happily surprised by the shows end. Given the first 11 episodes vibe, (7 as an exception) I expected a cheerful and happy end. Instead, what I got was an action packed, epic ending where fucks were no longer given.\\n\r\nWhich is good, but I can't forgive 50% of the show being very mediocre plot wise.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art may surprise some, but it is quick to adapt to. It fitted the anime's ambience and feel, and the fight scenes were good.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLikewise, the sound is good and fitted the anime well. I liked some openings/endings.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nConsidering there is some overlap, you get about 12 shinobis + close to 12 blade guardians as enemies. For most of these 20+ characters, there was simply no character development. And sadly, we did not get to see Sabi Hakuhei fight. And even for some characters that were more fleshed out, we got little explanation on their past. How are Enzaemon and Houhou truly related? Why/how did Shichika kill his father? I feel like they tried to develop many characters only to kill them in the same episode they show up, rendering their develop to be greatly superficial, while undermining screen time for more important characters. As result, we still have some big questions regarding the characters by the end of the show.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI did enjoy the show. My enjoyment for the show's second half was higher as the first half was mediocre. However, watching Katanagatari was not a particularly memorable experience.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a good anime. It does fall prey to its own premise of one blade per episode, but most of the time it worked out all alright. It's just that I think the plot and characters could be better handled. \\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "I expected it to take me on an entertaining ride. On an action-packed, fun-filled journey with romantic elements between the leads acting as spice to further enhance the flavor of the story. Would it be correct to say that it succeeded in proving itself worth my time? That it satiated my expectations?\r\nYes, it did. It did that and much more. Oh so much more. Some elucidation is in order, yes? Elucidate I shall -\r\nKatanagatari is a story about swords. Contrary to what most people would think by reading the synopsis or watching the pilot episode, this isn\u2019t a journey about collection of the swords butrather the focal point of the story is our main lead \u2013 a sword \u2013 Yasuri Shichika. It is his journey \u2013 a journey which shapes him; which showcases his metamorphosis from a sword devoid of emotions and feelings acting on the mercy of their master to an individual, a human being, capable of inhabiting emotions and expressing his feelings as a person.\\n\\n\r\nIt would\u2019ve failed as a story if it didn\u2019t possess a likeable cast. For a character-centered story to work, it is very important to make the character in question likeable. Which this anime manages to do quite well. He may seem like a caricature \u2013 a cardboard cut-out and a character as bland as he can be; in the beginning, at least. But the story intends for that to be the case. He is a sword, after all, and not a human being.  Over the course of the story, he develops into a character. And the development feels organic and not very out of place. Togame, the other main character in this story, is the loud-mouthed female lead. She may seem like any regular protagonist or love interest that you\u2019d find in any generic anime but that\u2019s not really the case considering the fact that her character possesses layers \u2013 layers that only become visible over time. And which add up to make her a suitably complex character. The majority of the cast, other than these two, are secondary and episodic characters in nature. Needless to say, they don\u2019t get to develop as characters as much as our main lead does \u2013 but that is irrelevant in the end because they merely serve as a means to further enhance the development of our lead. Their strong characterization and distinct persona help them build a strong first impression, no matter how insignificant they may be, and, as a result, they end up being memorable to a degree despite the minuscule screen-time some of them may get.\\n\\n\r\nA story possessing likeable leads and sufficiently distinct secondary characters won\u2019t mean much if the story itself didn\u2019t pack a punch \u2013 which, thankfully, isn\u2019t the case here. The overall story of Katanagatari is pretty strong. It packs in quite a bit of content in its 12 episode run, partially owing to its unique episode length, and it deals with themes like revenge, cursed fate and asks you questions about what it means to possess resolve, what is the reason behind people engaging in the act of war, what it means to follow your true objective \u2013 how you may have to discard all of your objectives to succeed in fulfilling your one true objective; all the while making commentary on things like correct and altered history \u2013 stuff that ties into the overarching story. Also, do not be fooled by its colorful visuals \u2013 it is a story possessing plenty of dark stuff. A good deal of the content on showcase here can be taken to attribute the show to possess nihilistic views. Some may argue against it and consider this story, at its core, a celebration of life itself but that\u2019s a subjective view which may vary from person to person. Regardless, content-wise it delivers.\\n\\n\r\nBut a good story with shoddy execution ultimately ends up as nothing but a messy bundle of plot-threads. As a result, the question is \u2013 does the execution front fail? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in an episodic fashion. And each episode consists of the characters engaging in conversations which eat up a majority of the episode length. This may be an action anime but all of the action in the show merely crops up for about 5 minutes per episode at the very end. This would spell disaster for most shows. It works here because the dialogue has been given a lot of attention \u2013 none of it is irrelevant or inconsequential. It may serve to fill the viewer in on the personality or motivations of a specific character at one instance or may act as a means to foreshadow future events in a subtle manner. As a result, you won\u2019t even notice that you\u2019d watched an anime with 90% dialogue and 10% action well after you\u2019ve finished it. That\u2019s what happened with me. THAT is how well done it is. Due to that, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend this show even to people who prefer action over talks \u2013 the same cannot be said of similar shows like Bakemonogatari and the like (other creations by the same author, Nisio Isin). But that\u2019s enough of a digression.\\n\\n\r\nWith story and characters out of the way, it is time to discuss the presentation and the production values of the show. The only word that comes to my mind when I think about the visuals in this show is \u2013 gorgeous. The art style is definitely unique and may not be everybody\u2019s cup of tea but it fits the story very well. Highly detailed vistas and intricately designed backgrounds are to be found aplenty in this anime. The character designs are highly distinct and they all stand out a lot from the generic characters that you\u2019d normally see in any anime. Their designs reflect their personality perfectly \u2013 as a result, just their mere appearance can tell you a lot about the kind of character that they are. A good move on the part of the production team considering the fact that most of the characters in question are episodic in nature, and, as a result, do not get significant screen time over the course of the story. Adding shades to their personality via colorful characterization is something this anime does really well as has been mentioned multiple times during the course of this review.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is another aspect of this show where they hit the nail right on the head. They\u2019ve nailed it \u2013 the anime boasts a good number of memorable soundtracks and they\u2019ve been used exquisitely to further enhance the atmosphere of any scene in the anime. If it weren\u2019t for the excellent soundtrack, this anime would\u2019ve lost a great deal of its atmosphere and its charm.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Katanagatari is well worth your time. It deserves multiple watches, in fact, since some details may slip by your eye during the first watch (as it did in my case). A nicely written story possessing likeable characters, gorgeous visuals and an amazing soundtrack \u2013 all in all, it is a fantastic package that should satiate your hunger for a well-crafted fantasy tale for some time and may even end up as one of your favorites. Like it very well did in my case.",

One day Shichika meets a gatecrasher named Togame. The shogunate entrusted Togame with a very difficult mission: she must collect twelve legendary swords owned by the legendary masters of swordsmanship. Later on Shichika agrees to help a fragile strategist and becomes her protection servant. The two set out to a journey towards the cruel fate.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline looks very simple and clich\u00e9: a boy meets a girl and they start their long journey. However, Katanagatari absorbed all these clich\u00e9 and made a unique fable that the majority of viewers will surely appreciate. Those who like intelligent shows will have to be very attentive to understand the storyline; however, if you appreciate spectacular battles, Katanagatari will surely offer them to you, as well. The unusual format of episodes (50 minutes per episode) ensures enough time for both spectacular battles and a good story development. \\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is truly a remarkable show to mention. Every episode our duo will have to collect a magic sword, fighting against a samurai or some other person. It may seem to one that it is simply unreal to make such story interesting and unique. Yet, Nisio Isin proved one more time that he does have a lustrous talent. Every episode features something new, and after awhile you will probably think that Katanagatari will cease to amaze you and offer you something that you have already seen. No, every episode has its aim, its new characters and features something new. I guarantee you that you will NEVER feel bored. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, the whole story-line is flawless, as it hasn\u2019t left any unanswered question and explained everything. It will surely take you some time to understand the plot, but when you understand it, you will understand the whole uniqueness of this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the animation is unusual won\u2019t be enough to describe it, but for some reason this new style works well. Without a doubt, it will take you some time to get used to it. But it won\u2019t take you that long, after an episode or two you will appreciate the abundance of different colors and it won\u2019t be a problem for you. \\n\\n\r\nFrom characters to landscapes, the animation is just something you won\u2019t find anywhere else. All characters are different and well-drawn, the action scenes are definitely odd, but for some reason you will appreciate that oddity. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nIwasaki Taku (Kuroshitsuji, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater) is famous for his bright talent. If you see Iwasaki as a person who was in charge of the anime\u2019s OST, the outcome is obvious-- the world will get another masterpiece. Katanagatari is not an exception, Mr. Iwasaki took a mix of different types of music over Asia and made a splendid OST for Katanagatari. You will find some Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese elements in his OST. You will definitely like this mix, as it is something you have never heard of in your life. \\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is only available in Japanese. You will probably find some fan-dubbed versions, but choosing them won\u2019t be a good idea. I am not trying to say that watching the subbed version for 600 minutes (50 min x 1 episode) is good either, but Katanagatari is an anime that you shouldn\u2019t be in haste with. With that being said, Tamura Yukari (Mine, Furude Rika, Takamachi Nanoha) and Hosoya Yoshimasa (Wave, Wataya Arata, Ginti ) did one hell of a job voicing their characters and you should, no you MUST, see it in Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe unusual format of Katanagatari ensures enough time for the character development. All characters were given enough screen-time, but the supporting characters could have been just a bit more interesting. Anyways, those who have already seen Spice and Wolf (and fell in love with its characters), will surely appreciate the Katanagatari\u2019s duo, Togame and Shichika. \\n\\n\r\nTogame is a strategist and represents the brains of Katanagatari. Using Shichika\u2019s strength, she defeats the enemies of the shogunate. You will see her ranting about luxuries or lecturing Shichika, but at the same time, she will play a cool strategist. Without a doubt, one may find her annoying, but her temperament does make her somewhat cute. After all, she is a fragile young lady, one should look after and protect. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you won\u2019t see a whiny tsundere, you will see just a normal young woman. \\n\\n\r\nShichika, having set off from his island, acts somewhat foolish and needs Togame\u2019s directions in EVERYTHING. He calls himself a weapon and he acts as a weapon doing everything what Togame tells him to do. You will see him holding Togame\u2019s hair, defeating the enemies of the shogunate, or protecting Togame from the sun. However, as the story-line progresses, Shichika becomes more humane and his character becomes simply splendid. (Note: Shichika in the first episode and Shichika in the last episode are the two different people. If you are ready to wait, Katanagatari will reward you.) \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Togame and Shichika are amazing. They love each other and that love is obvious, but you will have a feeling that they don\u2019t even know each other. Their development is simply splendid; the changes in character that they undergo are simply unforgettable.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\r\n1)Storyline.\\n\r\n2)Art.\\n\r\n3)Music.\\n\r\n4)Characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t find anything bad about this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9,75/10)\\n\\n\r\nAre you tired of mediocrity and clich\u00e9s? I know how to help you! Katanagatari will take you on a long-long journey, which will make you forget about all these \"anime.\" \\n\\n\r\nFans of Spice and Wolf, Mushishi, Kino no Tabi, and perhaps Bakemonogatari, will be glad to discover Katanagatari. If the anime\u2019s duration is the only thing, which stops you from watching this show, just forget about it. I wish you to enjoy Katanagatari as much as I did.",

Both of these light novels were originally authored by NisiOisiN, however Katanagatari is being adapted by another studio called White Fox, as a series of monthly specials.\r\nThis is a story of a girl named &ldquo;Togame&rdquo; the shogun&rsquo;s strategist\r\nand\r\n&ldquo;Shichika&rdquo; the current 7thhead of the Kyotouryuu &ldquo;the no sword style&rdquo;\\n\\n\r\nAt the moment the story is pretty common, they go on a trip to collect the twelve treasured swords created by a legendary swordsmith &ldquo;Shikizaki Kiki&rdquo; and all the sword are currently in the hands of some great swordsman, as you probably can imagine yourself they do not want to give their sword to Togame and Shichika :) . In the first episode they get the first sword and in the second episode they fight for their second sword. Let&rsquo;s see Katanagatari will have 12 Episodes there are 12 swords to search and obtain. If you ask me, it&rsquo;s probably going to be one sword in every episode ;) . Hopefully it&rsquo;s not going to be a walking to the owner of the sword, thinking of a strategy, talking funny crap and defeating the owner.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can you expect from the story?\\n\r\nIf you want to see fancy looking sword fights you are at the wrong address. No really the &ldquo;fight&rdquo; in the 2nd episode took about 2 minutes. In the rest of the episode our duo was talking about a catchphrase for Shichika, how they want to defeat Ginkaku the owner of the second sword and they go out shopping.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari seems to go the talking way. In the first two episode 95% of the time was talking and the rest was fighting, but don&rsquo;t get me wrong&hellip; it&rsquo;s not boring!\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in this Anime are just awesome. Shichika is definitely a funny character with his nonchalant attitude towards things and his devotion to Togame. And I love Togame&rsquo;s straightforwardness (especially in her demand for Shichika&rsquo;s love). It&rsquo;s just funny seeing those two discussing about something like the catchphrase &ndash; sure it&rsquo;s not really story relevant but gives them a nice touch &ndash; and seeing them flirt. Those two are such a sweet couple. I&rsquo;m very excited to see how Togame and Shichika&rsquo;s relationship develope, given their family situations.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning the art has a refreshing new look I heard many people say it&rsquo;s &ldquo;simple&rdquo; but watch the first episode and you will see it&rsquo;s definitely not. Having seen many, many animes with similar art styles, this anime brings forth a fresh new style that is very easy on the eyes and very entertaining.  The colors are attractive, not to mention the characters are all very beautiful (cute?), even the bad guys. I just love how Togame looks :S damn she could evolve into a new &ldquo;Favorite Character&rdquo;.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation in Katanagatari is really smooth when it comes to a fight it just looks really good and epic. Seriously the fight was just two minutes long but WOW those two minutes where really good.\\n\\n\r\nTogame&rsquo;s Voice comes from Tamura, Yukari. You may know her from Clannad(Sunohara), Naruto(Tenten) or Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (Furude) she fits Togame pretty good &ndash; noisy and uppish and on the other side sweet and shy.\\n\\n\r\nShichika&rsquo;s Voice comes from Hosoya, Yoshimasa he&rsquo;s a newcomer! Katanagatari and Denpa teki na Kanojo are the only Anime where he&rsquo;s voicing a main character ( he voiced only 3 characters so far), but he is doing a GREAT job. Shichika&rsquo;s voice is so funny he talks so unchalant and it really seems like everything is too much work for him.\\n\\n\r\nHands down i really like the soundtrack in Katanagatari! The first two minutes of episode one really stunned me. I enjoyed Kawai, Kenji&rsquo;s music in &ldquo;Ghost in the Shell&rdquo; and the music here reminds me of it. On the other side, while Togame and Shichika were discussing about the catchphrase, japanese hip hop was played. Normally I don&rsquo;t really like hip hop, but this one was really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was incredibly refreshing with its historical based genre mixed with just a little but fitting action, comedy and just the right dash of romance.  The only, perhaps, downside to some people is the amount of dialogue.  After the first 20 minutes, I was feeling like I&rsquo;ve read a book.  However, I would suffer through the intense dialogue any day for a good anime such as Katanagatari! This series holds so much potential and promises to be a real winner!\\n\\n\r\nIf you have 50 minutes and you don&rsquo;t know wich anime you want to start, please take a look at Katanagatari!\\n\r\nFirst Look Scores\\n\\n\r\n    * Story 7/10\\n\r\n    * Animation 8/10\\n\r\n    * Sound 9/10\\n\r\n    * Characters 8/10\\n\r\n    * Overall 8/10\\n\\n",

I didn't watch all episodes yet but last one i watched (7) was 1fps or less in 80 percent of time. It was more of a picture drama then animation. I know this way production goes faster and a lot cheaper but damn ain't i frustrated. I can not understand why they did this terrible thing to most badass fight (in theory)yet. I am already invested in plot so i can not simplystop watching and since i am disturbed by animation quality it will be only thing i will see in 5 remaining episodes.\\n\r\n       Looking to how popular and well scored this aniime is i can say that not every one thinks like me but if you find that animation is important in anime i would tell stay the fudge out of this one. I simply can not understand how this many people give this serie 10/10 masterpiece score. I think it had the potential of masterpiece but it butchered by production. \\n\r\n     Sorry about my bad english and amateurly written review.",

            "content": "Note: I wrote this review in 2014, but I don't feel like it would be right to go back and change any of my opinions after not having watched the show in so long.\r\nLet me tell you about a story, that's about swords. A sword story. A Katanagatari.\r\nThis is spoiler-free.\r\nSometimes I watch a series, and then immediately forget about it, being that so many anime use the same tropes and follow cookie-cutter cliches to a point where I think \"Why do I even watch these?\". Katanagatari is like a glass of orange juice in a world of only milk and water. I've never watched ashow that struck me with such a power sense of difference. It was appallingly refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I even start...\\n\r\nI'll go with the superficial stuff first.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the artstyle here. All the scenery and characters are so uniquely designed that I vividly remember what the enemy from episode one looked like. I never got over how beautiful the design for the main girl, Togame (right) was even until the end. They put so much care into each costume and setting that it made it feel like a real journey. Every passing episode was so memorable that it really feels like you carry that experience with you to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show is just mm. MMM MMM MMM. It's.. IT'S JUST SO GOOD. GO LISTEN TO IT. A lot of them were obviously intended as BGM, but a lot of them are just simply fantastic songs. I really can't describe it any other way than a perfect fit for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI already mentioned that the characters were visually unique, but even more so were their personalities. The MC, Yasuri Shichika, lived on a remote island with his older sister for the first 20 years of his life. Meaning that he had no contact with anyone other than her. This makes the journey across Japan a very strange experience for him, as most things in society he sees as unnecessary or \"a hassle\" as he often repeats in the first half of the show. By the latter half he was grown in knowledge and in personality as he becomes less of a simple-minded farm hand type, to what makes a hero. Togame starts out being a calculated, high-horse tactician // \"strategian\", my bad, to begin to show some emotions as Togame and Shichika walk together and they (as well as the viewer) learn more about each other. \\n\r\nHowever that's just the main two characters. The rest of the cast is so well written that they don't even feel like side-characters like they do in other shows. Each episode they may introduce two or three new characters, but they have so much personality that it doesn't take long for them to be a memorable part of the story. There are a few that don't last very long, but they are very few. Most of them present their own story and their own ambitions. \\n\r\nThis is getting a little long... THERE'S A LOT OF THEM, BUT THEY'RE ALL PRETTY LOVABLE.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIt might've been a little weird of me to save story for last, but I did it on purpose. Katanagatari is completely aware of what it tries to be, a story. Every almost every aspect of the show reflects this. \"Spoon omg, I've been reading for like four minutes and I don't even know what this is about\" Okay okay. So basically it's called \"Sword Story\" because Togame recruits Shichika to help her collect 12 swords made by a legendary swordsman named something with a lot of K's in it. \"Woah wait a second, there's 12 episodes in the series!\" Why yes there is, and you're right, each episode is about one particular sword, and its owner. \"But how can it do so much in only 12 episodes?\" ... Here's the thing. Each episode.. is actually TWO episodes. Each one is 49 minutes long including OP and ED. This really helped hit two things home in my perspective. Firstly, how much of a mold-breaker this show is on top of everything else. Secondly, it allowed them to write a fully fleshed out story for each episode, uninterrupted. Each episode is like a mini movie, with their own respective sub-plots. It took the immersion to an even greater level than it would've otherwise. A small decision, but it made a big difference IMO. So, the story-telling is one of, if not the strongest aspect of the show. That being said, it does contain at least one fight scene each episode. Honestly, this is where the show could do a little better, but from what I can tell, writing fight scenes isn't their strength, so they made them short and sweet and beautifully animated. This is another point that helps drive home the theme of a STORY. It was enough to notice, but it wasn't so much that it put me off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI lost sleep to keep watching this show more than one night. I was genuinely interested in the story and its characters all the way through. The interactions between Shichika and Togame are fun and full of heart and the atmosphere and characters were immersive. I would whole-heartedly recommend this show to anyone who wants a change of pace.\\n\\n\r\nIt was okay, I give it a 9/10.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this show more. But it greatly disappointed me.\r\nSometimes, a journey is about the distance traveled rather than the original goal or destination. As doors open and horizons broaden, it becomes possible to view the world in a completely different light. To that end, a similar thing could be said about renowned author Nisio Isin\u2019s quirky spin on a traditional samurai tale, Katanagatari. \r\nNisio Isin has become somewhat of a household name in the anime community for his signature writing style. Widely acclaimed for his work on both the Monogatari series and Medaka Box, Katanagatari is another example of Isin\u2019s talents.Situated in a traditional period setting, Isin defines his story with contemporary allusions and innumerable jokes on the sub-culture particularities of modern day Japan. Along with an eccentric cast that remains engaging, Katanagatari becomes a journey unlike any other. \\n\\n\r\nAs the title suggests, Katanagatari is a story about swords, or more specifically a journey set in Japan\u2019s Edo era revolving around the collection of twelve legendary swords sought out by the shogunate: the Deviant Blades. The plot kicks off following the shogunate\u2019s self-appointed tactician, Togame, landing ashore a small island in the middle of nowhere. Here she meets Shichika Yasuri, the son of an exiled war hero and seventh head of the Kyoutouryuu school of martial arts. Through some rather unorthodox reasoning, Togame enlists Shichika\u2019s aid. Much to her dismay however, she receives far less than what she bargained for as Shichika is a country bumpkin with some of the most deplorable social skills. And so begins a journey of friendship, adventure and tragedy as the two skewer Japan\u2019s outer reaches for the twelve Deviant Blades. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like Shichika, Katanagatari is a story that hails from humble roots. Since the show\u2019s premise does very little to distinguish itself from a bare bones fetch quest, audiences expecting a more innovative plot line may be discouraged at first glance. Coupled with a narrative composition similar to a JRPG, Katanagatari can give the initial impression that it\u2019s nothing more than a string of random fights interspersed between lots of long-winded dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, this is one story that proves it shouldn\u2019t be judged solely by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the premise makes it clear that the original goal of the story was to retrieve each of the twelve Deviant Blades, the route that Katanagatari takes allows for a much grander experience. The episodes are usually structured in such a way where adequate time is given to allow the two characters to soak up the local culture extensively before confronting their foe. Each of the locations that the characters visit is rich with unique customs, practices and cuisine. Complementing the backdrops nicely is Isin\u2019s vision for his story, which integrates endless puns, otaku-centric humor and modern day practices into the script. \\n\\n\r\nFurther immersing the viewer are the show\u2019s artistic direction, animation quality and soundtrack. To complement the wide variety of locations that the characters visit, the animation quality remains high throughout the series with plenty of rustic detail being given to the interior locations and outside environments. However, to spice things up, the unusual character attire designed by illustrator Take along with the colour palettes chosen by White Fox juxtaposes the more traditional style of the time period. There\u2019s also some other nifty elements of contemporary culture present such as Togame\u2019s misuse of the British saying \u201ccheerio\u201d along with some of the designs of the later Deviant Blades. In a similar vein, the soundtrack is primarily composed of traditional Japanese music, which is occasionally mixed in with more modern day electronic tracks, further adding to Katanagatari\u2019s uniqueness. \\n\\n\r\nFor an individual such as Shichika who has lived a secluded life with largely only the company of his sister, the journey unsurprisingly does wonders for him. As the series progresses, he becomes increasingly humanized, gaining a better grasp of the way of the world, its customs, and most importantly of all, how to hold a regular conversation. Now this may seem like a fairly straightforward progression in terms of character, but one area Katanagatari excels in is how naturally it handles Shichika\u2019s development. While many series encounter the unfortunate pitfall of having characters restate the obvious via monologue, the show takes a subtler approach by conveying his improved conversation proficiency and wider variety of facial expressions. In his upbringing, Shichika was raised solely as a human weapon, an idea which finds itself challenged by Isin\u2019s writing numerous times throughout the series. The dialogue central to Shichika is part of White Fox\u2019s comprehensive process of humanizing him over the course of the twelve fifty minute episodes. The end result of this progression being that it directly reflects the encounters Shichika has across the different lands, making the journey a more believable account. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, only half of the credit can really be given to Shichika himself as he\u2019s just one side of the coin. His trusty travelling partner, Togame, complements the dynamic duo\u2019s chemistry nicely by serving as a motivating love interest and compensating for his intellectual weaknesses. Togame is a bit of a tsundere character minus most of the unneeded servings of abuse and archetypical one-liners, sparking some engaging dynamics between her and the show\u2019s resident brick wall. Her upbeat, quick-tempered attitude with the occasional blush thrown in really lightens up a lot of her conversations with Shichika considering their rather questionable methods for obtaining the swords. Especially during the early stages of their journey when Shichika\u2019s social skills are lacking the most, Togame\u2019s ability to make light of many situations keeps the dialogue from reaching an otherwise dead halt. Along with her cultural clumsiness, snarky remarks, and childish demeanour, she helps to maintain the energy of the journey amidst the most barren of locations. These conversations also highlight Shichika\u2019s social ineptitude, keeping it in focus for the audience so that his progress throughout the series becomes evident. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the two peas in a pod and the contemporary allusions used to spice up this tale, it is Isin\u2019s signature writing style that is the final ingredient of Katanagatari\u2019s unique flavour. The most prominent instances of his style are his characteristic fourth wall breaks, word plays and genre parodies, which fit nicely into such a dialogue heavy show. Many of the pair\u2019s conversations err on irrelevancies such as Togame\u2019s misuse of common sayings or Shichika\u2019s lack of knowledge about the world, whereas other topics deconstruct more common usages of words such as a weapon. That isn\u2019t to say that these conversations serve no purpose in the grand scheme of things, as it is actually quite the opposite. Since much of the series revolves around Shicika's social development, even the most mundane of topics help with his progression and are thus important in the long run. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are instances where Isin\u2019s writing style is almost a double-edged sword. Though a great deal of the dialogue heavy scenes between Shichika and Togame are right on track, the same cannot be said for every application of his writing. Since Katanagatari does feature a number of fight scenes in almost every episode, there are instances where the long-winded dialogue does more harm than good. This is partly due to the show\u2019s primary antagonists, a group of ninja also seeking out the Deviant Blades called the Maniwa Corps. Unlike Shichika and Togame, the Maniwa seem to just ramble on about unimportant details that can leave the audience in anticipation for far too long. And while some of the wit or self-parody can be amusing at first, the pre-battle dialogue does drag out to the point where some viewers may wonder why Shichika hasn\u2019t already floored each overly flamboyant punching bag. Especially for audiences simply craving a good fight, this aspect of Katanagatari along with the large gap in strength between Shichika and his opponents can be rather off-putting. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, a lot of the genre parodies within the script can make it difficult to determine how this story of swords wants to view itself. While there are instances where it\u2019s evident that the show is engaging in light hearted fun, some of the more serious moments aren\u2019t made nearly as crystal clear. The merging of clich\u00e9d dialogue with highly emotional moments can frustrate some audiences, while leaving others bewildered. It also doesn\u2019t help that the series lacks closure during parts of its finale, making it difficult to determine whether Isin\u2019s writing is simply getting sloppy or he\u2019s just pulling the audience\u2019s leg once again. \\n\\n\r\nWith all said and done, Katanagatari is still a fresh take on a fairly traditional tale. The numerous contemporary allusions, colourful cast and setting along with the script possessing Isin\u2019s signature flair truly makes this a journey unlike any other. The dialogue between Shichika and Togame is rich with puns and clever word plays, while ultimately reflecting their experiences during their journey. Although the story does have a few rough edges, it\u2019s certainly something that can be overlooked in favour of the overall experience. \\n\\n\r\nEven with the original purpose of the journey lost, meaning can still be found in the enriching experiences encountered along the way. While every person may have his or her own island, Katanagatari demonstrates that it is only if they travel into the wide seas that they will truly see the world for what it is. As they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained.\\n\\n\r\n**SPOILER ALERT**\\n\\n\r\nSo if you actually think about it all that shichika was made for was apparently to just kill the shogun since they confirmed he didnt show up after that anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThis means that instead of creating 5000000 swords and doing all that FUCKING BULLSHIT he could have just assassinated the shogun since the whole anime in itself doesn't have a point.\\n\\n\r\nGod I hate it when an anime is completely based around something that misses the entire point of what it was supposed to be about.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is usually loomed over by the far more popular Monogatari series, and with good reason. It's character design is, at the very least, abnormal for any anime fan. But is that really enough reason to skip the series?\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nHow can something so simple be so enticing? The plot of Katanagatari is very straightforward: Collect the 12 sacred swords and bring them to the king. To be honest, there really is nothing that jumps out and makes it say 'WATCH THIS ANIME, NOW!' That's probably another reason Katanagatari is so unpopular. But, the flaws in the story stop there. Sure, it's heavily packed with dialogue,but it's not as if there is no meaning to it! On top of that, the story is surprisingly unique in comparison to other adventure anime, and the plot progression and pacing is quite fantastic. But, by far the best part of Katanagatari is it's ending. It's an emotional ending that concludes the story perfectly, and shows how much of a weapon Shichika could have been if he hadn't been placed under an immature human like Togame, and is well animated, executed, and just amazing.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the turn off for most people about Katanagatari, mainly because of character design.  We'll get to that later. First: The actual art style in Katanagatari is unique and, put simply, beautiful. Buildings have elaborate detail shown, and there are many scenes that will have you pausing the episode and just admiring how gorgeous it looks most of the time. The animation? Even better. The fighting scenes, in particular, are some of the best I've ever seen in anime. The dialogue scenes aren't bad either, at no point does White Fox try making their job any easier by covering the mouth or having action offscreen. (With the exception of one fight.)\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes in Katanagatari are lackluster at best. Especially because they change the ending so frequently, the one or two good ones are outweighed by the many others. Of the two openings, the first one is completely skippable, unless you count the beautiful animation that oozes out of it. The second opening, despite being more pleasant to the ear, is less well animated, and overall is a little better, but not by much. The soundtrack however, leaves not much to be desired. This is quite frankly the only anime soundtrack that I can say I enjoyed each and every one through and through. The tough and hardcore battle music, peaceful relaxation music, and finally, the hilarious comedic music. They're all spectacular.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari again flourishes in this area. The two main characters, Shichika and Togame, are an EXTREMELY well done duo, as they fill in the flaws of each other rather well. They're not so much unique personality wise as they are design wise. Shichika's maple leaf design in particular really stands out. The supporting characters as well, are designed impressively and have fairly unique personalities, but mainly beautiful designs. Very few of them fall into tropes, and they all work well together. But the bad thing about them? Most of them have a wacky eye design. Is it really bad though? No. No, I can honestly say that this design didn't  bother me at all and I was completely adapted to it after episode 1. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari has all the markings of a good anime, and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a long enjoyable adventure. I can't say it's for everyone though. As I mentioned earlier, there is a LOT of dialogue. If you're someone who only watches shonen, and only looks at anime for the fights, this might not be your cup of tea. Regardless, Katanagatari is a great anime. CHEERIO!\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari \u5200\u8a9e Review\r\nStory (7/10) Good\r\nThe story for ....Sword Story should I say. Starts off really promising with each episode being basically an hour long you would assume that this anime would get a lot accomplish with a minimum of 49 minutes on the clock when each episode starts. Katanagatari story like i said starts off with potential a and by the end I felt it was a good story, nothing more. Because in my opinion it's barely breaking good and by good I also mean satisfying because for me they go hand and hand which I will talk about more in the enjoyment section. Asfar as the ending route the anime decided to talk which you can tell what route the anime is taking by the end of episode 11. And the route it took it probably the only reason I felt this anime's story section made it to a 7 which is considered good but I can't bare to say it's anything more than a 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nFrom the get go when you look at the art style you might say it's... different. I didn't like it at first but that only lasted for about 30 minutes into episode 1 and then I got used to it and realized it isn't bad it's just different. As far as animation it's probably the reason this section made it to an 8. The animation was very good everything moved nicely especially during fight scenes (what little good fight scenes we got that is..). \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari sound is very good and maybe I'm being generous in this section but it is what it is. The sound and voice actors I thought all sounded and matched each character and the bgm used matched the time Katangatari is set it which I assume is years after or during the time of the Shogunate, so a lot of samurai like and japanese bgm which is fitting to say the least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) Good  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Katangatari I thought was fine. Shichika our MC is quite ignorant from the start of the anime not really care for the world around him as he master's his the technique handed down to him from is father as a follows Togame the main female roll on their quest to collect the swords. He says he does it because he's fallen for her which happens so sudden it's not really believable in my opinion. I really want to know if it had anything to do with Togame's eye because it seems that every time she made a demand towards Shichika her eye would change into that purple cross state as if he was mind controlling him some how, if they explained it then I guess I missed it because this anime is quite dialogue heavy and if you see what my enjoyment rating was I wouldn't be surprised if such information flew over my head because I'm not going to lie I was dozing off a bit here and there during these hour like dialogue heavy episode but I digress. Anyway the other characters like Shichika's sister was an interesting character but it felt by the half way point of the series she was used as a plot device to enhanced the character development of the MC so it is what it is, don't know if I should look at that as a bad thing or good thing. Shichika's character development during the series definitely was a rollercoaster to say the least. He's definitely went thru about 4 phases his IDC phase during the start of the anime, his happy ignorant phase during majority of the anime and then his \"battousai\" phase during the final episode, the at the end of the final episode the I guess IDC phase but more knowledgeable phase than the beginning.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10) Mediocre \\n\\n\r\nI was not watching this anime when it first came out so coming in here realizing that each episode are basically an hour long each this anime can be considered a 36 episode anime more or less. With that being said this anime is rather fucking dialogue heavy and that's not really a con. But it is subjective at the end of the day if the dialogue you are consuming is interesting to you or not because that's what will keep your going at the end of the day. With 12 episode this is basically how majority of the episodes' formula went. Shichika and Togame enter a new area with a new character that holds one of the \"swords\" that they are collecting. They talk with said character and stay withing their region should I said basically talking with each other and the character they want to take the sword from for basically majority of the hour long episode. The episodes may or may not go off and show what's going on with other characters like Emonzaemon, Nanami and Houou. Not to sound like an ass but it is my opinion and I indeed found the formula rather repetitive because it became predictable and kind of boring when every episode basically (imo) hypes up the conflict between Shichika and who ever owns the sword they he and Togame are trying to get. I understand they every conflict doesn't have to end in a climatic way or but when EVERY SINGLE CONCLUSION to EVERY SINGLE CONFLICT on EVERY SINGLE EPISODE felt anti-climatic to me there's an issue. Please I don't want to sit there and list every single anti-climatic ending this anime decided to throw at me because trust me I can but I've written enough for this section. All I'll say is the last fight between Shichika and Emonzaemon barely was satisfying to me but I'll take it over every other fight leading up to that point. (There was even one fight that they decided to show during the fucking preview at the end of one episode and during that next episode we don't even get to see it, we just here about how epic it was WTF *the Hakuhei vs Shichika fight if you are confused or can't remember which fight I'm talking about* that's probably even worse than an anticlimactic fight is one that is hyped up and never even shown instead we get a side story which was entertaining I guess but at the end of the day just setup for an upcoming plot device death in the next episode)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a good anime nothing more nothing less. It's good I really have nothing else to say about it. I was satisfied on the semi-dark route it took at the end of anime but other than that I didn't this it did anything that blew my mind or made me think it was anything higher than a 7. Did it have the potential? Fuck yeah a lot especially during the halfway point with that certain death they I thought it was going to pick up from that point but then it goes back into it's repetitive formula oh well. I think the things that held it back from being anything more than a 7 to me is it's repetitiveness and anticlimactic endings. Although the end of the overall ending of satisfying the overall anime I felt was anticlimactic as far as what I hear from people who actually where hyping up this anime. It's good that's all I can give it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Talk about character development.\r\nOk so Katanagatari is about two people with really long hair that have been tasked with the retrieval of 12 sword and they have around about 12, 50 minute episodes to do it, so like a simple enough premise right? Well Katanagatari is a bit more than just 12 episodes of chasing after swords followed by a little development of the person wielding one of said swords, followed by the protagonist beating them and all that. The show actually gets into the WHY these people are fighting. If someone asked you that question what would you say? Money? Power? To protect theones you care about? Because you were told to? It doesn't really matter but they get into it in the anime and do a bloody good job of why each person is there doing what they're doing. Now right along to the actually review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes an episodic approach, like I said above 12 swords, 12 episode to get them all, its a really simple story honestly and because of this it's easy enough to swallow, but they find time to build the characters really well amongest all the fighting and strategizing, more on that front later.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is....odd, but really good at the same time, this is the first time I've characters with two part eyes, watch the show and you'll see what I mean. there is one point where the art style shifts to being void of every color but red, and I remember that scene well. So basically the art is different and because of this you notice a lot more than you normally would in a generic (Hate that word) style anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo the sound I didn't really care as usual, I didn't even listen to the OP the voice acting was on pair, people should gather by now that if nothing from the soundtrack grabs me I'm not really going to talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the MEAT of this anime, the character's. I'm going to paint a picture for you, imagine a sword, this swords soul purpose is to be wielded by you in anyway you see fit, now imagine that sword is actually a human, that is how the ML starts the anime as, but as the anime goes on he starts learning these things called emotions, example; early in the show he straight up murders someone, later on he kills another certain someone and actually feels regret, before a point he will kill anyone the FL tells him to, later on he spares someone of his own volition.\\n\\n\r\nThe ML just grows from this, because I can't think of better phrasing, shell to a fully fleshed out human, and come the end of the show I'm pretty sure it shows us what happens to a person who is REALLY good at fighting when the person they love has literally just died in their arms and they. Just. BREAK. That moment was fucking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nTo people who actually take my recommendations to heart (in which case thank you, nice to know some people listen to me) do yourself a favor and watch Katanagatari, you will be in for an experience.\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",

And what is a sword? well, a sword is an edge with a handle, and if a sword is an edge and this show is about swords (12 of them in fact), thus we can determine that this show must be reasonably edgy. And it does not dissapoint, this series will have you on the edge of your seat all 12 episodes through, which should I mention, are 50 minutes long instead of the standard 25 minutes, making this show even more unorthodox and edgy. So this guy Shichika lives onthe island and gril named Togame shows up and they go on a hunt for 12 swords blah blah blah, he ends up falling in love with her and would follow her to the edge of oblivion. Swords get collected in an edgy fashion and the end has a good twist which I really didn't expect; pretty edgy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Edgy/10\\n\r\nBut srsly 9/10 good show, would fuck.",

For the rest of it episodes 1-10 was good. Character development was only good for the 2 main characters, the rest of them it didn't do as well. Plot wise it was good, episodes taken individually is much better than thewhole. All in all it's a good anime, with a massively disappointing ending but makes up for it in it's unique artwork.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is yet another -gatari \"story\" (forgive my pun), written by none other then the Monogatari legend him self Nisio Isin or NisioisiN.  As his cleaver pen name implies this guy really loves his word play.  This is something very common to all of his works and Katanagatari is definitely no slouch in that department.   In my opinion katanagatari is one of the most unique/interesting anime to come along in the last generation in so far as plot, character and dialogue driven anime goes.  Before I go into to detail as to why I hold this anime in high praise,I will say quite bluntly that if you have not watched Katanagatari then you should, However, by that point you'll have been torn to pieces.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story is concerned, a 10 is almost too understating.  This is not to say that the story of Katanagatari is absolutely flawless or that there is no other anime that lives up to this story, there certainly are other anime that are just as good if not better in different respects (story-wise).  Katanagatari runs the full gamete in terms of what it actually does.  Not only is the writing top notch but the structure, themes and metaphors behind the story are very well crafted.  This makes for a very unconventional anime that masks its self as a very conventional journey anime et la samurai champloo.  Its almost as though Katanagatari is a deconstruction of this style of anime in the same way that puella magi madoka magica was a deconstruction of the magical girl anime or in the same way evangelion was for mecha.  Of course though, this genera of anime isn't as well founded as magical girls or mecha anime but its still a similar style in the sense that it is a \"realistic\" interpretation at least as far as the plot and characters are conserned.   Never did was I able to guess where the anime would go next when it threw a curve ball nor did I imagine that it would turn out so complex at the end, however, it is able to do this so very well all while balancing emotion/action and comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is very akin to the afore mentioned Samurai Champloo with mixes of Monogatari as well as some of its own unique takes.  Some portions look like they were taken from Visual novels while others look absolutely gorgeous.  There is a very minimalist approach here that works to complement the more complex writing character art.  The character art and animations are very fluid and well done as well as deceptive and serve to help each of the characters flesh out into their own unique personas.  Overall the art is up there with other top notch shows produced by studio giants of the like of Kyoto Animation or Shaft while not being too avant garde to take away from its audience. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound track and sound samples are all amazing.  They create great atmosphere and help complement the complex emotions that fit in the very long signature dialogue scenes and the very fast paced action sequences.  The voice acting is extremely well done as well, with each character truly being fleshed out by all involved.  Even the small side characters are very well received and can stand on their own with such great voice acting.  Each voice actor delivers their lines with such gusto and such bravado as well as great timing.  Again, though the real stand out here is the musical score, I really cant say that enough.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the many characters are very fleshed out with complex yet some times simplistic motives.  In particular, the two lead characters pull you in.  They make you love and sometimes hate them.  The character development is what makes all of this work so well.  From the first episode to the last, each of the characters change in ways that are very realistic yet surprising at the same time.  Everyone from the narrator who states the obvious to the side characters play their roles perfectly creating a very believable world even with all these \"supernatural-type\" powers.  Each one has his or her own identity as well as own motive in the plot and each one is neither good nor bad when you really break things down.  \\n\\n\r\nOne thing i would be remiss to not talk about is the dialogue and the overall writing.  Japanese word play is different then English because of Kanji, with each character meaning more then one thing in most cases, we have times when the writing uses these multiple meanings to its advantage.  And of course since this is a NisioisiN work, the dialogue is very very long winded but with good reason.  His style of telling most of the story through a series of conversations works very well here as it serves to allow the audience to fully grasp the emotions of each of the characters as well as their motivations.  Metaphor is scattered everywhere with tons and tons of very complex ideas that may not be very apparent from the get go view.  After viewing this show a few times, i still find things that I missed out on, in previous occasions.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Katanagatari is a great anime for anyone who likes anime in general but also in specific for people who enjoy good writing, good action and stories that may or may not have a happy ending, aka realist stories.  In my opinion it is an achievement in anime that reminds me that anime is also an art form that can be as serious as the most beautiful painting or piece of literature.   I know i gave this entire thing a 10 out of 10 for everything, but honestly, it really resonated with me that much.  You may not see it as a shining beacon of awesome like I do, but I guarantee you will enjoy your self even if you dont, However, by that point you'll have been torn to pieces.",

            "content": "Watching a beautiful story unfold before your very eyes is insanely rare yet on occasions you find one series that manages to tell an epic story that leaves you with a void inside knowing that you\u2019ll never experience anything like that ever again.  Well, I\u2019m about to talk about a series where many feel this exact same way I do, Katanagatgari!\r\nKatanagatari was an anime released in 2010 created by White Fox containing 12 episodes, 50 minutes in length.  Its genres include Action, Adventure and Martial Arts! \r\nThe Story\r\nSynopsis\r\nKatanagatari\u2019s story initiates when Togame, a strategist, searches for Shichika, a person who studies Kyoutoryuu.Kyuoutoryuu is essentially a fighting style that resembles sword wielding without actually holding a sword.  After finding him on an island and having troubles with an enemy they both embark on a journey searching for 12 Legendary Deviant Blades located across Edo Era Japan.  Togame is the strategist, and Shichika is her sword, together their story unfolds as we observe their interactions with each other, the abnormal people they encounter and learn the true meaning of what it means to be human.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Katanagatari isn\u2019t necessarily about the sword collecting but moreso about shaping Shichika\u2019s character into becoming more human from his initial amoral emotionless self.  Even though he\u2019s under the contracted ownership of Togame as her sword, Shichika after leaving his home island learns each episode about a new element of what makes someone a human which ties into multiple more themes that are fleshed out, some relating to my favorite philosophy ever! Existentialism!  Shichika constantly gains the ability of free will while struggling to find a purpose in life which is rewarding to watch.  However, even though it\u2019s existential, the story of Katanagatari is in the grand scheme of things, pointless.  But the reason for the story\u2019s existence is because it\u2019s a story worth being told, the adventures are truly spectacular and unique in their own way which holds a ton of valuable storytelling.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat would this show be without its dialogue?  Eh, probably trash.  It is also a show dedicated to presenting some of the most genius and engaging dialogue I\u2019ve ever seen.  The conversations usually accumulate up to 95% of the episode.  Even though the dialogue is hefty with some of the diction being anomalous, it never invoked any sort of pretentious feeling which is a problem for some conversation heavy shows.  The dialogue was never cumbersome, each individual line of dialogue holds some variation of meaning and importance.  It can be utilized to establish characters with plenty of subtleties and quirks that give you a sense of their inner thoughts.  It reveals how Shichika\u2019s personality and diction drastically changes like dialogue displaying sadness and jealousy, something his previous amoral self wouldn\u2019t demonstrate.  The heavy amounts of dialogue can be boring for people, especially for those who are actiontards who only care about how the power of friendship can get them a random shounen powerup.  But if you listen and pay attention, the amount of subtlety and wittiness is an element that truly should be appreciated.  \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, because the show is dialogue heavy, the buildup to fights end up being anticlimactic with battles lasting less than 20 seconds.  This could be due to the fact that Nisio Isin is a huge troll because he takes what the audience anticipates and completely crushes them just for him to get a great laugh, sitting on his throne with piles of Monogatari money and body pillows while licking muddy feet that fetishy bastard.  But, as much as I love his trolling I won\u2019t deny that at least 2 of the fights that were hyped up since the beginning of the show ended up leaving me disappointed in the end, and while I do understand why they were anticlimactic I felt as if a certain line was crossed by a tiny margin which left me with an empty feeling.  I felt like Donald Trump not kicking out a minority from a rally.  To make up for it the final episode features an excellently choreographed duel that may be one of my favorite fight scenes ever due to the high adrenaline and stakes.  The show could be called predictable since every episode you encounter a new person and it eventually ends with the retrieval of sword but in retrospect, the show throws insane amounts of curveballs to subvert the audience\u2019s expectations.  This happens on multiple occasions, right when you think Katanagatari doesn\u2019t have anything else it can surprise you with it somehow creeps from the shadows and slaps you in the face with something new.  And that\u2019s what makes this series so engaging, it\u2019s fresh and knows how to please its audience.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s freshness brings out an intriguing theme I\u2019ve rarely witnessed in any medium which is the falsification of history but describing how this idea intertwines in Katanagatari will lead to spoilers.  All I\u2019m going to say is that while it was handled extremely well, and is pretty ambitious, I personally found the explanations to be quite confusing but after skimming through the wiki I fully understood it.  Although, it was highly riveting and added a nice clean layer of fatalistic philosophy to the thematic orgy pot that gave the show an extra layer of intelligence.  In case you don\u2019t understand what fatalism is because I\u2019m a pretentious asshole, it is the belief that all events are predetermined and inevitable.  A specific character that is encountered later in the story can predict the future, and even though he realizes it's inevitable he attempts to change it anyways which plays a massive role in Katanagatari.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s ending, depending on the viewpoint can either be extremely satisfying or dumb.  However, those people who say it\u2019s dumb are incorrect!  The themes completely come full circle and though weird and unexpected, the ending closed off the story beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nAside from a few characters in Katanagatari, the sword wielders who wield the blades are limited to only one episode of screen time which is challenging in terms of establishing and making you genuinely care for these characters.  I\u2019d say that Katanagatari executes an excellent job aside from a handful of characters.\\n\\n\r\nShichika takes the spotlight of the story.  In the beginning we see him as an amoral human that lacks any sort of emotion due to being secluded on an island all of his life.  It\u2019s to the point where he initially is unable to feel any sort of sexual attraction towards Togame or other women.  What did this guy whack his meat to then? Trees?  Well, hey, the Na\u2019vi from Avatar somewhat seduce trees so it\u2019s possible.  His amorality initially made him extremely deadpan, always talking in a monotone manner.  However, his bland personality changes extremely.  As previously stated and might be somewhat redundant, The whole entire journey is about shaping him into a human through the various adventures embarks on and witnessing how the various emotions he accumulates affects his interactions with the characters and the world.  He learns such things as jealousy, compassion, intimacy, loneliness, and human unpredictability which evolves him from being just a mere sword to an actual genuine human.  They show his development rather than spewing it to the audience, it\u2019s never like \u201cYOU GAINED THE EMOTION OF JEALOUSY\u201d, his actions speak rather than words.  In another episode with a man wielding an armor...sword...thing...Don\u2019t question it, starts flirting with Togame leaving Shichika with a pissed off attitude without him realizing that he started to feel jealousy because he doesn\u2019t understand full human emotions.  With all of these adventures you witness his personality change and it\u2019s intriguing to observe how his newly found behaviors affect his interactions.  As he increasingly develops he actually starts shouldering guilt from those he killed in battle which is extremely humanlike and adds another layer of complexity to his character that I was surprised to see.  In addition to this we get a general glimpse into his backstory to observe where his amorality originated and how he adopted skills in the Kyoutouryu martial arts style.  Not to mention this man is a legitimate savage, this guy is a tall and powerful juggernaut of badassery that wrecks anyone and anything in his path and it\u2019s a blast to see his obscure fighting style displayed onscreen.  Through quick witty remarks, self discovery, phenomenal amounts of development and intense fighting, Shichika is easily amongst my favorite male leads ever, right up there with good Ol\u2019 sexy shirtless Onizuka...I\u2019m straight, I just want Onizuka\u2019s body tho.\\n\\n\r\nTogame is hands down one of the most geniusly written female characters that this anime medium has yet to bestow in front my eyes.  Her outgoing personality easily gives her ample amounts of presence due to her dominating the conversation most of the time.  To dichotomize this, she bottles up plenty of negative emotions and inner demons that adds another layer to her character.  She is widely recognized for her exquisite ability to strategize schemes in order for her and Shichika to overcome strenuous situations.  When she\u2019s scheming it is awesomely shown through the use of the snake eye she always have whenever she concocts a plan.  The snake eye also symbolically characterizes the inner workings of her character because while she may be filled with knowledge, the serpant equally represents her ruthless nature when it comes to how she achieves her goals.  Overall Togame is a strong female protagonist who feels like an actual character not attached to any archetype, has exceedingly clever dialogue, generates sensational character interactions with Shichika, and grows from her tragic backstory. She\u2019s pretty cute too, I mean, look at those nice..round\u2026.eyes. Yum!\\n\\n\r\nThe maniwani are a weird furry loving clan who are opposing Shichika and Togame\u2019s quest for the blades.  Since Katanagatari is insanely thematic, I believe that the Maniwani are supposed to represent loyalty since in about 90% of the scenes it is shown that they all rely on each other to reach their goal.  If one of their comrades gets murdered they they will stop at nothing to avenge their death which is highly appreciable.  They are divided into the bird, beast, insect and fish squads all containing, Weird *ss characters for a lack of a better term.  Their interactions fabricate some of the oddest bits of conversation when I say strange, oh my. They make Ikuhara appear normal, THE CREATOR OF GAY BEARS AND PENGUINS WITHOUT DRUMS... NORMAL?  NANI SORE?!?!?! .  It\u2019s difficult not to spoil how abnormal they are but viewing the anime will validate my point.  However, I desired for them to be more fleshed out because they receive almost no development nor any reason to care about whenever one dies.  The deficit of any additional motivation driving them to fight and succeed also connects to that issue.  Overall, between the great action they provide, the quirkiness of their dialogue, and their extreme sense of loyalty creates interesting characters that sadly weren\u2019t explored as thoroughly\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the side characters as mentioned are for the most part well handled despite their short spotlight.  They actually take the time to elaborate on why a character acts in a specific way, why they wield their swords, and in some instances flesh them out quite a bit.  Each character has their own story to tell, and that\u2019s what makes Katanagatari the greatness that it is, interconnecting stories that all intertwine with the general whole picture.  One of my favorites is the third episode which thematically was about compassion and the treatment of women in Edo Era Japan.  The character they focused on demonstrated her deep care for the suffering women at the shrine and even though she gave them all swords to feel self-empowered and validated she felt bad about how relying on their source of power will eventually poison them mentally.  It was a simple yet powerful story that was accomplished by allowing us to care about the female they focused on in the story.  Each character symbolically a certain human trait that Shichika is missing but at the same time they have more substance beyond just being a simple representation aside from 1 or 2 characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation\\n\r\nKatanagatari has one of the most breathtaking and aesthetically pleasing art styles I have ever witnessed.  The multitude of colors for both the backgrounds and the environments manages to make every scene appear whimsical.  Sometimes, the backgrounds appear to be stripped right from an old Japanese portrait, it just gives off a truly remarkable artistic feeling that takes a heavy creative license.  Occasionally the lighting from the epic sunsets and the moon can be enticing with shading that fits with the show\u2019s style. The different biomes also enhance the tone of the episode like the one that was set in a snowy biome to amplify the theme of loneliness and desolateness.  The designs for each character completely dichotomizes the stereotypical attire of Edo Era Japan with numerous zany and wacky designs that makes you wonder if the author was a cocaine addict.  Shichika\u2019s design suits him well, with the upper half being shirtless to express his power while the leaves motif throughout his design could symbolize growth which is essentially what Shichika does within the entire series as a character.  The swords themselves are\u2026 Well, they\u2019re great and all but don\u2019t expect the conventional long handle sharp blade \u201cGuts pierce me\u201d type of sword.  Instead we got swords like a slice n dice sex doll and a sword without a blade.... weird, ain't it?  One huge complaint I have is episode 7 where the art style became bolder and was directed with tons of video game types of aesthetics that didn\u2019t cooperate with the darker tone the episode set out to achieve.  While it totally didn\u2019t kill the episode, I found it hard to take things seriously when I see Shichika\u2019s sister slashing enemies from a top down view in a videogame-esque form, this isn\u2019t legend of zelda four sword\u2019s oh, I mean triforce heroes, blah it\u2019s the same shit with one less sword fuck you Nintendo, it\u2019s Katanagatari!  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is delightful with ocassional quirks and minor movements to add flavor.  Katanagatari delivers without being inconsistent and leaving no scenes choppy and unloved.  The animation truly shines during the fight scenes with fluidity that would make Madhouse cry.  *Don\u2019t worry madhouse, we know you dropped the ball on Overlord*. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Katanagatari captures the beautiful essence of Edo Era Japan with many pieces adding to the overall atmosphere.  Bahasa Palus is amongst my favorites in the soundtrack, it\u2019s a piece that utilizes vocal chants and is very upbeat, it\u2019s usually played before a fight scene to get the viewer hyped.  Track 22 is reminiscent of the Making of a Cyborg track in Ghost in the Shell but has an entirely different feel that actually fits with the setting, it\u2019s beautiful.  Those are only a couple of tracks but as a whole the OST invokes lots of emotion and adds some sugar, spice, and everything oh so nice to the atmosphere.  The opening songs are decent but the rebroadcast opening by Supercell is downright fantastic starting off with a slow melancholic melody but then instantly seduces your ears as the tempo increases.  The opening is literally the embodiment of what Katanagatari is, sad, adventurous and epic as all hell!.  The voice acting was a blessing to the ears, I felt like Jesus literally came down as I bent over and he gave my ears his divine love.  Shichika\u2019s voice acting is awesome, initially very monotone which fits his personality and slowly as he accumulates emotions his voice alters generating steadily growing liveliness in his character.  Togame\u2019s voice actress did an excellent job although her face looks like a compressed elephant\u2019s head.  The playful nature of her character is amplified, her serious tone is demanding the audience\u2019s attention and just CHEERIO!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari was a blast to watch, the witty dialogue, explored themes, excellent leads, vibrant art style and eargasm soundtrack make for one of the best anime experiences I\u2019ve ever had.  Standing in my top 15, Katanagatari is amongst one of my favorite anime and deserves a rating of Fantabulous, it is truly a piece of fiction that everyone should view if they consider themselves an anime fan.  \\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is a historical fantasy anime revolving around a set of incredible cursed 'swords'. These incredibly powerful weapons corrupted anyone who would use them, and became known ad the Deviant Blades. The main characters are Togami, a short white-haired girl who has been tasked with the retrieval of these weapons, and Shinchika, a tall dark-haired martial artist who she enlists to do the actual fighting. What follows is a grand adventure across twelve episodes and most of the country as they do battle with these cursed weapons.\r\nThis is where the Story takes a bit of a left turn. The show has a very loose definitionof what a sword is, and as the episodes continue, the swords become increasingly bizarre and eventually impossible, hence the show existing as fantasy. There's also mentions of a prophesy, and the hint that the events of the series are being manipulated in some kind of grand scheme that reaches across time and space itself. To say more would be to spoil the plot entirely. What I can tell you is that while the plot is serviceable enough, that's what it is - a vehicle for everything else. 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe good news is, everything else is GREAT. The Art style is different, to say the least, and looks a bit like a fusion of Samurai Jack and Naruto. While you're getting your head around that bizarre visual, let me say that it's very pretty, though the minimalist method occasionally has you begging for more detail. 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound design is pretty good, and let me say while the music itself does a great job of capturing the feeling behind the moment, the actual sound you're going to hear can get a bit annoying. Some of the twangyness from a few songs stuck with me like the auditory equivalent of gristle in my teeth - mildly unpleasant but not enough for me to reduce the volume. 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization is the strongest aspect of this show by far. Shinchika and Togami have a wonderful dynamic that slowly progresses from episode to episode, and you can track specific qualities of their character growth with ease. Perhaps the best part of the characterization is how the protagonists always get to know the owner of the Deviant Blade before doing battle, and the human qualities we see in them create a subtle cognitive dissonance. Most of them are not using their weapons to do any harm, so are the protagonists the 'good guys'? The show never gives any easy answers, and at the very least the nature of the characters will stick with you long after the show is over and you've forgotten the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOne character in particular keeps this from a perfect score - Shinchika's sister. To explain the exact nature of her character would ruin the plot of at least two episodes, but in advance she's probably the greatest Mary Sue to ever exists. Episodes with her are entertaining, but her complete lack of meaningful flaws and poor character development make her a liability more than an asset. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Katanagatari, far more than the studio's previous show Bakemonogatari. The relationship between characters feels natural, the fights are a fun mix of physical prowess and cerebral strategy and tactics, and the slower pacing of the show never felt like a hindrance, rather it gave the writers more time to explore the nature of the characters presented. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI give it a solid 8 out of ten. If you're looking to blow a full day (the episodes are 50 minutes each, not 22) and you're into historical fiction or martial arts, you'll have a good time. Just don't analyze the plot too much, and just roll with it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final thought, I should mention that the final episode of the show is ALL payoff, and contains one of the most brutal, one-sided series of fights I have ever seen, culminating in an incredible final showdown that will leave you wanting to watch it all over again.",

Right now it seems pretty simple if you read the synopsis of this anime, some dude (the main character) has to find 12 swords (makes me remember the old days of dragonball, then dragonball Z). Plot seems simple and staight forward, but I feel that we are in for a few twists.\r\nBased on the fact that there seems to be only 12 episodes to be released, Katanagatari should have a lot of action in a 46 minute slot, and I have a feeling that alot of minor details, that could make this story a lot better might be left out. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is simple in this anime. I think that the animators were going more for the history and principles behind the animation series, rather than boost it up with special effects. So if you are looking for state of the art graphics, you will not find it in this series. \\n\\n\r\nSound effects, background music, and other sonar stimulants seem to be well adapted to the story. I will not comment much right now since it is too soon to really know. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are simple and seem to go back to the basics, but I feel that they will become very rich in the future as the story evolves.\\n\\n\r\nI found this anime to be quite interesting, and I am looking forward to the next episodes to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\nThank You.",

Everything is pretty damn good.\r\nHowever the determined/stubborn/time wasting reader may have proceeded further into this review and for those rare people I now review and stop wasting your time.\r\nKatanagatari is a unique show written by Nisio Isin, one of my favorite writers, famous for shows such as the mess that is the Bakemonogatari franchise and the Medaka Box. If you've seen/read either of these works then you know what to expect, fascinating characters mixed in with an interesting plot and with healthy doses of comedy.\r\nStory-10\r\nMy poor knowledgeof the Japanese language (mostly based off ramen and noodles) says that Katanagatari literally translates as \"sword\" and \"story\". \\n\r\nThis is in short a story about collecting 12 magical swords forged by the great sword smith Shikizaki Kiki. The two leads Yasuri Shichika and Togame the Strategian must work to traverse Edo-era Japan to collect the swords on their way defeating traitorous ninjas, ex-bandits and the shades of their past (literally). \\n\r\nHowever this description does not truly do the show justice. On the surface the series appears as a fairly typical shounen-esque romp through a famous period in Japanese history. But the true meanings about legacy and duty are something that requires a good deal more thought and introspection. \\n\r\nLuckily the viewer will definitely have time for this as the 50 minute long episodes are extremely dialogue heavy (as expected from a show by the same writer as Bakemonogatari).\\n\r\nWithout spoiling the show hits hard and is very, very clever.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9   \\n\r\nThe art style for the show is once again fairly unique being relatively simplistic but with a lot of attention to detail. Personally it is beautiful. Elements such as the symbolism in the clothes that each character wears, to the variation and scope of the background scenes as the characters travel the land, really brought me into the world they were depicting. The fight scenes are also for the most part fantastically choreographed and animated, which means the show still gets by as an action show to a degree.\\n\r\nMy only criticisms would be episode 7 which animated in an entirely different (and personally much lower quality) style which did make a low point of an episode which would of otherwise have been the high point of the show.\\n\r\nAlso the fight scenes do disappoint towards the end either due to lack of budget(?) or just as an attempt to how show increasing power. A little bit sad but not breaking in any way.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nOnce again they hit home and do it hard. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED are both acceptable but after the first repetition I did just skip them as neither competed in any way to the glory that is the show. Shame.\\n\r\nHowever the music throughout the show is fantastic with the highlight being \u201cBahasa Palus\u201d which I may have been playing on loop constantly while writing this. Music fits the tone of the scene perfectly in all scenes ranging between the epic fight scenes to the casual comedy. What more can you ask for?\\n\r\nVoice acting is also superb (from the point of view of someone who speaks no Japanese). Special props go to Yoshimasa Hosoya for his role is Shichika and my personal favourite Yukari Tamura as Togame who carries out the role of a fantastic character amazingly (also appears as  Remon from Ano Natsu, Rika from Higurashi and Seppuku bunny from Kampfer (for you true artisans of taste)). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nWhere the show truly shines. \\n\r\nAll of the leads are interesting, well developed characters, with driving motives behind their actions and decisions. \\n\r\nOur lead is Yasuri Shichika the orphaned son of the Kyoto Ryu family and current head. The strength in his character comes from his isolation from early childhood which leaves him with a unique world view and value system which places him many rungs above the shallow character he may initially appear as.\\n\r\nNext is Togame the self-appointed Strategian of the Shogunate who seeks the swords for her own goals and desire for power for reasons not entirely made clear *hint hint*. Togame plays the dual role of the fragile genius and the source of a good deal of the feels in this show, and my, there are a lot of feels. \\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is extensive with a number of other main roles along with a large cast newly introduced each week in a cowboy beepbop-esque manner (Phrase stolen from a certain Demodeezy). New characters are seen each week and often discarded immediately afterwards but each is developed to an extent that few shows can match, and that in such a way that their effects on the characters are seen long afterwards. It is done extremely well with each one used to convey a small part of the overall message of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nVery much so. \\n\r\nIn case my gushing has not conveyed this I really quite liked this show. It is filled with deep meaning, symbolism and thoughts that pull together to make a true gem of an experience.\\n\r\nThe show does something which I always feel the best anime\u2019s do and that is be fluid in how they present their world encompassing many emotions into each episode with action, comedy, romance and sadness all shown in equal measures. (though some hurt more). The 50 minute run time for each episode can make it daunting and less casual. The lack of a dub is also significant with the sheer volume of words often thrown at the screen being overwhelming at times. However the show is a true treat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nWatch it.\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t regret it. \\n\r\nUnless you get emotionally scarred easily. \\n\r\nOr if you have human emotions.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad okay!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is an animated combination of a 1990\u2019s shounen with a 2000\u2019s style and budget.  It\u2019s the best of an action-adventure series meshed together with a wordy script and social dialogue that elevate this series into something more than your archetypical shonen. While it is far from being a favorite, there was never a point where I was bored. In fact I strongly got the impression that Katanagatari was set up to gradually build interest and anticipation from one episode to the next \u2013 a major proponent for the shows\u2019 success considering its original air time was one episode a month for twelve months.\\n\r\nThe cast of Katanagatari is extensive but memorable in both appearance and personality. The artwork is distinctive in how the faces are rather simplistic and drawn in a style perhaps more suitable for a children\u2019s show. While in contrast, the costume design is highly detailed and vibrant so much to the point that you\u2019ll end up remembering characters for what they were wearing and not what they were saying. This is actually a smart move, seeing as how wordy the script is, viewers would be bound to forget who said or did what but the variation in character design (and their environment) help to ensure that most of what you\u2019re watching actually stays with you. \\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, the lead MC\u2019s are a female strategist named Togame and her \u201cliving sword\u201d bodyguard, Shichika whom she found on a sparsely inhabited island. Shichika\u2019s social skills are virtually non-existent since he\u2019s had little interaction with people besides his long deceased parents and his older sister. His interdisciplinary skills are so lacking at this point that he can\u2019t even recognize faces besides his sisters\u2019 and his own. Togame is his opposite. She\u2019s tactful, slick and despite the explicit revealing of her past, much of her ambitions and who she truly is remains shrouded in mystery from start to finish. She\u2019s not just a liar, but a good liar and for that reason viewers will either love or hate her. Despite their differences, Togame and Shichika display great chemistry and have a charming relationship, but with the introduction of far more open and dynamic side characters and enemies, their chemistry slowly begins to subside. \\n\r\nThe supporting cast members are presented with proper introductions that explain who they are and their relationship to the main characters and other affiliates. This is especially noticeable with the antagonists so much to the point that by the conclusion I felt as though I knew more about the will and intent of the enemies than I did the protagonists. Is that to say that they, Shichika and Togame, were any less fleshed out or interesting? Yes and no. While their initial interactions were sweet and engaging, as time went on (and as Shichika became more acclimated into mainstream society) it felt as if he and Togame were steadily growing further apart instead of closer together. While much of the show kept you guessing as to what will happen next, the shift in their relationship hints that much of what they had in the beginning was attributed to fate and that neither of them would have sought each other out under any other circumstance. There\u2019s also the added frustration that even though Shichika has learned more and more about the relationship between men and women he still doesn\u2019t even bother to initiate sex with Togame. Basically, you\u2019re just sitting through this long ass show waiting for them to fuck and they don\u2019t. Who cares.\\n",

            "content": "I originally intended to give this show a solid 8 rating, it was good, things were happening and thought it was going for a pretty straight forward ending, then the last two episodes happened, everything turned upside down, it became one of the best anime's I ever watched, so its a 10/10 for me. \r\nStory: The story is quite good, nothing fancy but not underwhelming too, you have your set of characters and everything revolves around them and their quest to get all their objectives. Its very dialogue heavy and sometimes can feel like you are watching a movie given every episode's 50 minute runtime,but the anime manages counter this with good story telling and avoiding any loose threads. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Quite unique, might not be everyone's cup of tea but all in all, very good work. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is a treasure to listen too, one of the best soundtracks of any anime in modern times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where it gets its masterpiece rating for me, the characters really spoke to me. There was a sense of progression, which at first felt slow and non existent, but it was subtly building to the point when the last two episodes happened, you could suddenly realize what just transpired and how the characters are going to act based on what you have seen so far. More than anything, the main character taught me that you can fall for someone even after seeing their faults, almost as if they were more of a contributing factor than their positive aspects, because it made the person you fall for, imperfect, yet relatable. It takes time to form any kind of genuine bond, and no matter how cold or scheming someone is, how much they have calculated their every move, they have also felt something real, something that they shared with you and made you even more fall for them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While the pacing is rather slow, it allows the story and character to breathe, take their time building off the story and execute it with near perfection. For all its character work and story, the action beats are pretty amazing too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A masterpiece, we need more anime's like this.",

The MAIN characters were good and the action sequences were decent as was the music.\r\nSo...good story and characters and action so why would I drop it?\\n\\n\r\nI dropped it for a few reasons.\\n\r\n1. The main character is an idiot (not always a bad thing) but just ridiculously so. \\n\r\n2. His motivation is so overused and makes no sense when he could ask for things that actually matter.\\n\r\n3. The female lead is incredibly weak and constantly needs to be protected and saved. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the last one is the worst. \\n\\n\r\nMonologue.. We've all seen it before. Where before they actually fight everyone involved has to have a long speech about who they are, what they can do, why they'll win and sometimes it will turn philosophical or even political and generally most of us tend to snooze for about 5 minutes before the real action starts.\\n\\n\r\nNormally that's okay as in a 20 minute episode it means (with opening and endings) we have roughly 15-18 minutes of anime goodness.\\n\\n\r\nMonologue in this series is RIDICULOUSLY LONG! People monologue for 10-15 minutes at a time without anything happening. Then they'll fight a little bit and monologue some more. \\n\\n\r\nThis is something that happened every episode and it doesn't serve any purpose other than being pointless drivel. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you feel you can stomach that then I really do recommend the series as the art alone is something to behold in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise maybe just give it a skip?\\n\\n\\n",

Almost everyone on the main cast shines with a prismatic sense of character. Albeit  some of them are very simple in nature. The music complimented the mood and tone of scenes. My biggest issue with the show was the pacing at times. Given that every episode is about 50 minutes I went into this expecting every second to be exciting and that might be too high of an expextation but it was disappointing nonetheless when the story slowed down. The true higlight was theamazing climax. Overall, id reccomend this show to people who like action or samurai shows. Also best girl was pretty great.",

Wooh. Yes, I was definitely excited. But it ended up being a disappointment from that perspective. It was definitely dialog-driven, but it cannot even hold a candle to the beauty that is the Monogatari series.\r\nThis anime was also supposed to a one for good fights. But, even there...\r\nExpecting uber-cool fight scenes? Watch Unlimited Blade Works instead.\r\nExpecting \"AHA!\" tactics during fights? Watch Hunter x Hunter instead. \r\nReally a let down here, because one of the MCs issupposed to be a schemer/strategist.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite this, it had a pleasant flow to it. It flowed slowly, but not tediously, like a folklore. The animation was also charming; very unique. So was the OST. Watch it when you just want to chill and don't want to watch something that would demand your attention.\\n\\n\r\nWas it a good anime? Yes. Did it have a lot of nuances and sub-plots? Maybe. But, it also could be just that, we the viewers, are grasping at straws to make sense of this plain old 'monogatari'. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending did make complete sense from Togame's perspective. Though sad, it was beautiful in a way. Shichika's ending? He did have tremendous character growth. And yes, you could say that also made sense. But Hitei's ending? That irked me. But I guess that just showed how much Shichika has grown as a character. And I also felt like the ending tried to make the anime much more grandiose than it was in reality. \\n\\n\r\nTurn off some parts of your brain and come relax in the world of Katanagatari (7.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nCheerio!",

            "content": "This is an anime that is tailored for a very specific taste. It's also good to mention in the beginning that there may be 12 episodes, but it's really more close to 24 because each episode has about 40 minutes to it rather than the usual 20 that anime has. \r\nTL:DR is at the very ending without spoilers, but the overall review might contain some. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe actual story is really complicated, and I had to look up some of the questions I had. The first reaction you might get after completing it would probably be, \"WTF??\" because it leaves you feeling really empty. Buttaking a moment to digest everything, the story was really well written.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you watch it as a comedy until the last few episodes which turn dark really quick, not that the show didn't indicate it's a dark show in the beginning. When Shichika casually mentions that he kills his father, but never really addresses it, it serves at a good indicator that despite the art and dry humor, this is a pretty messed up story. It reminded me a bit like Panties and Stockings where the art and humor seemed light but was very 18+ for various of reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe story unravels itself much similar as a puzzle, not really getting the full picture until you have reached the end and take a step back. It holds the idea of legacy as well as how the future cannot be changed. I would also argue that it is a coming of age (not really?? since Shichika is already grown in body but not really in mind), and how Shichika develops himself as a person paving his own fate in the end, not accepting his position as a sword. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many other points the story tells that is embedded within the series, but at the same time, I wouldn't say it was perfect story telling. There were many plot holes in terms of specific characters, but as an overarching story, it did well. As specific episodes, I would say only the last few hold any significance. Despite the fact it was overly complicated in my opinion, the concepts it held and told made me give high marks for it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was what actually drew me to this series. It was really unusual for an anime to have such a distinct style such as this. The character designs physically all fit to my personal aesthetic taste that I really enjoyed. The cartoonish? style as well as how the colors matched with everything especially with the characters ( such as the color scheme of the Maniwani's and Shichika's sister etc.) really came together nicely. Nothing felt overwhelmingly too colorful, despite the very vibrant colors of the entire series. The themes they had set for each character also in term of looks were great, giving distinct characteristics that allowed you to distinguish everyone. Same face syndrome (Love Idol???? *cough cough*) was not there despite the simplicity of the art style itself. \\n\\n\r\nI just really liked the color palette and art my dude. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow wow. I have not enjoyed a soundtrack like this since, I don't know, Princess Kaguya? It mixes between traditional japanese sounds, but often puts this hip pop? in the background which.... oddly fits really well. It fit so well I couldn't help but to admire it and try to hear it when they were sometimes talking. \\n\\n\r\nIt threw me off at first because that was not what I was expecting as well as not the usual anime soundtrack which I was use to. But while watching the series, it flowed so well in a sense that the mood of the sound did not seem forceful on the situation. Sometimes, when you get series moods or action scenes, which places this dramatic moment, indicating that it is a dramatic moment. \\n\\n\r\nIt's useful and can even be iconic (My Hero Academia, ya'll know that one song when Deku brings out his smash). But this was a change to hear a different sense where you didn't really realize the background music, but still noticed it at the same time for it's uniqueness. I'll probably go back and look up the soundtrack to listen to it again because I enjoyed it so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\r\nHmm, the characters had levels of complexity to them..... and they also did not. The ending really showed the true nature of the characters as well as how much they have grown, or not grown because humans are difficult creatures to change in a span of a short time. \\n\\n\r\nThis is why I say they were both complex and not. The audience attaches themselves to the character during the story because, they are very likable characters. All of them. However, most of the characters don't grow beyond their original character designs, making you feel as if you are liking something that you see on paper rather than, well an actual personality. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems rather a vague imitation of a complex personality. They seem really simple. \\n\\n\r\nThen in the end, they reveal, tada, these people are a lot more complex than you thought. But by then the audience has attached themselves to these characters as a simple character, not a complex thinking one. So when their appearing personality is shown that it was not what it was without any solid resolution to it, you feel distaste on how everyone ended. \\n\\n\r\nI understand that the characters were sacrificed for the sake of the story telling, but that leaves the audience that these characters were empty shells made for only the purpose of reaching a specific ending and meaning to this story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nThey did not really think too deep for the enjoyment of the audience. A lot of the episodes feel as fillers, and the overall feel pace of the show is pretty slow despite the fact that they collect the swords quickly. Because of this, I can see why a lot of people feel bored watching this and drop it. \\n\\n\r\nBut I can say it was really enjoyable because the characters are still likable and the driving force of the story (collecting the swords) is really strong despite the fact that you probably know how it is going to end. It's sort of feeds on that guilty pleasure of watching it for the sake of watching and specific things but boy, they were not friendly to the audience on the dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also the reason why I said you need a specific taste to enjoy the show or else, you'll watch it feeling as if you forced yourself to watch the entire thing only there to be no solid resolve and feeling empty. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it much more once I realized the main purpose of the anime and what the writer wished to tell. But I have to say, I was thinking WTF IS THIS when I initially finished it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say, yes it was a good anime. Would I recommend it? If you enjoy anime's where you are sort of left confused and wishing to find a resolve, much like Paprika (although, Paprika and things like Perfect Blue are incomparable) I would recommend it. It's a great time killer in terms of episodes and as a story, allows you to have a good \"Ah hah!\" moment once you piece it all together. But it requires either resolve or a specific taste for certain humor, visuals, etc. to get through the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, if you are looking for anime with a dramatic resolve and character development (similar to Assassination Classroom which was cute but very very enjoyable), this really isn't the one. \\n\\n\r\nIf I can describe this anime in a sentence it would be,\\n\\n\r\nAn actionish type that gives off a mood of slice of life but oddly has a deeper meaning to it if you look.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE:\r\nOk this is my first review ever, so sorry if its shit. \r\nWhere do I begin?  You have no idea how long its been since I watched something that I enjoyed so much, every episode was so interesting even though most of it consists of people talking. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis is simply amazing, dare I say that this anime has the best pacing that I have ever seen. They never let you be confused while watching, something that a lot of animes do nowadays. This will remind you a lot of the monogatari series, since its made by the same creators. Everything made sense,they leave it all out on the open, while there are certain things that arent explained, it's all done for the sake of the story. What im trying to say is that everything fits together, while keeping a perfect pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very unique, either you love it or you hate it. Very simplistic, but at the same time very detailed, this allows characters to be easily distinguishable and have a memorable look. The moment you look at a character, you instantly know who it is, it also gives them a lot of personality due to their unique looks. One example of this is Pengin, he is a very shy and nervous person, which is why he is always dressed as a penguin. \\n\r\nThe eyes are one of the reason why i love the art so much, its so different and unique. Its almost like they dont have eyes at all. Though I do think that its inconsistent with all characters, I dont like how some characters have normal eyes and others dont, but maybe only swordsmen have normal eyes and everyone else dont, idk.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack used throughout the show fits the story and the genre so well, you will never hear something that sounds out of place. The OP and outro songs are so good, especially the outro song (lay back is my favourite). I always watched till the end of the outro just so i could hear the whole song. \\n\r\nOverall its very unique and pleasant soundtrack and isnt forgettable  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me this is the highlight of the anime, the character development is done so well. Every character put forward I cared about, every single one, they made me feel sad when anyone died even the \"bad guys\". I put quotation marks on the \"bad guys\" because while at the beginning they are shown as bad people, you quickly become attached to said characters. Even during short scenes, they take the time to show you how close each character is to each other, and how they might have built up their relationships. \\n\r\nConsistency is something that every anime should aim for, and Katanagatari hit it perfectly, some phrases that a side character during a short scene will be referenced during another scene like 5 episodes ahead. This is great because you feel immersed in their world.\\n\r\nYasuri, who started as a cold hearted person that didnt care who he killed, let alone distinguish two different people from eachother, slowly softened up as he killed more and more people. He even got to the point where he felt guilt and regretted killing some person. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis took me for a roller-coaster of emotions, made me really happy at time, but made me cry my fucking eyes out at others. They most certainly arent afraid to crush your soul, which is something that I love and respect. A lot of animes just go for the easy route and make everything turn out ok in the end, which isnt how it actually happens. Horrible things happen to everyone and animes shouldnt try to pretend it doesnt and make the character lives perfect without any major issues.\\n\r\nI loved watching every second of this anime and highly recommend anyone to watch it.",

            "content": "This anime. Compared to all the other anime I have watched this one has easily became my favorite. The common story of collecting \"legendary\" swords, the meeting of a slow, and strong guy and the brilliant girl he must protect seems to be a common, generic and boring. Katanagatari is not a common, generic and boring anime.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story which I have already discussed is extraordinary. But like many great stories it is something that needs to be experienced first hand, and no summary can give you the same feeling as watching it unfold in front of you. That being said the plot and allit's twist and turns will keep you at the edge of your seat, and the 50 minutes per episode will just fly by.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThis is a hit or miss. You either fall in love with it or you hate it. The artwork is simple, yet to me its beautiful. The characters have such detail given to them, (especially in the fight scenes) that its hard to believe that its the same anime that you were watching before. The backgrounds, although looking plain are again simple. The aren't bad but they fit in perfectly with this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music and voice acting are great. The voices match the characters and their emotions quite well. Togame and Shichika can have almost their entire personality and development as characters be seen through the voice acting and tone. The playful and comedic parts, ranging to the intense fights is all very well done. The sound tracks, (the two openings and 12 endings) as well as the background music is all very nice. The only problem is that during the anime itself is that either the music is barely noticeable or its blaring ridiculously loudly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI fell for the characters. I fell for Togame. I fell for Shichika. These two main characters were done extremely well. Their development, their personalities, their cons and their pros. All of it was done incredibly. Some of the other characters (especially the Maniwani) did have their problems. The majority of the supporting cast did not have their full characters developed. Normally this would warrant a lower score but the incredible detail that went into making the two main characters cancels out an faults that were left by any supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAs i have said before this has become my favorite anime of all time. The story, the art, the sound, the characters all led me to love this anime. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it, from the beginning to the very end.",

Still this last episode is the best of the anime and a good conclusion, thought a little confusing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite difficult to say what's the message of the anime as it deals with a lot of subjects, for example the history, the definition of a human being, the reason to live etc... The characters will have to find answers to various questions, and the achievements of one episode will often be questionned in the next.\\n\\n\r\nSo a fairly good anime to watch, maybe to watch again.

            "content": "Bias & First Impression:\r\nThe first time I laid eyes upon this I thought this would just be another average shounen, with a set number of bad guys to fight on the main character\u2019s journey. The art was sort of odd too and it was on a year schedule for 12 episodes. To say the least I was deterred.\r\n\tThe first episode was a surprise. There was quite a lot of talking going on top of an actually legit plot. However it still was not immediately catching.\r\nExpectation: 6 (Fine)\r\nFinal Grade: 8 (Very Good)\r\nIndividual episode rating: -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,9,10\r\nEvaluation:\r\n\tThe story did stick to the one sword an episode, but thatdid not limit what it was able to produce. Although it takes a while for the plot to pile up, by the last few episodes it really conglomerated together. In the end I would not claim the story to actually be all that great. Indeed, it was very episodic which didn\u2019t allow for a very good flow. However, the keystone to the shows worth comes in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Shichika is the average idiot which is fitting for one who must act as his partner\u2019s sword, many of the other characters have quite the quirks. Togame is a very likeable character, who exploits Shichika\u2019s willingness to server her. Indeed, she is the brains of the combo, and makes sure she gets treated as such. The owners of the deviant blades have their personality matched to their individual sword, and span the spectrum from noble samurai, to ninjas, yeti people, robots. What might not be obvious is that the term blade is used quiet loosely, as the blades all have their unique uses and shapes; think bleach but ignore the stigma associated with this reference. The Maniwani ninjas take the cake for the most interesting characters with their animal costumes fit to their ninjutsu.\\n\\n\r\nWords of caution, if you expect this to be a true action show I suggest you reconsider. Although this seems to be the case with most action shows anyways, there is a marginal amount of real action. Shichika is a unarmed fighter who is incapable of holding a sword, against the specialized ability of the other sword. He doesn\u2019t have any real special ability of his own, so the focus is more in finding the weakness of the opponent rather than powering himself up.\\n\r\n The quality is not bad during these scenes, but the focus is more on the behind the scenes preparations. The duo usually will meet their opponent, togame will try to think of a strategy, and then implement it. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the show consists of long monologues, either for the plot, or just random attempts at comedy. It took me some time to get used to the heavy conversation, as you will find them to drag on to great lengths and have great depth. For an example, during one scene a character talks for 15 minutes with minimal interruption. While it requires some concentration to read all the subtitles, you will come out with a net gain.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nNone of the OP or ED are particularly a favorite, but there is a great number since they have 14 songs total. A few weren't bad, so you might find a few you will enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI am glad I stuck with the show. As time went on I grew accustomed to the show\u2019s style and the better episodes are later on during the series. Though it was rather straightforward and episodic, It came together in quiet an epic finale that sort of surprised me. If we consider how we only follow two characters, and how Shichika slowly gains knowledge of the world and how to think, since he has been shut on an island all his life, the development is not horrible. If the start had been more enjoyable for me I would have given this a 9/10, but I am a tough grader after all.",

Just because I may not have liked elements of it's story, it's personality or it's conclusions, I couldn't possibly fault it. Just as sometimes you may despise the villain in a movie, if it weren't for that villain's existence, the protagonist couldn't shine so bright. Such is Katanagatari. It itself depicts and builds upon this principle of discomfort so masterfully that in the end, whetheryou liked it or not, you can't help but appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the journey is the most important part of an adventure. You may reach the end at some point, but it's not about obtaining your goal, it's about what went into obtaining your goal that matters. Katanagatari is a tale of swords. Collecting swords, wielding swords and even being swords. And if/when you watch it, reflect on this notion that Katanagatari approaches storytelling like a sword. It is emotionless, but can play with emotions. It is comical, but doesn't need to laugh. Sorry if this all sounds like some sort of superfluous mumbo jumbo but it's very interesting to reflect on the story as if it were itself a sword. One swing, and you follow it's path. It ends it's swing with it's original intent in mind, nothing else. No matter what it may encounter during it's swing, it will finish it with it's goal in mind.\\n\\n\r\nThat out of the way, the story of Katanagatari was well-founded and intriguing. The characters really brought to life the progression through their journey. This is an interesting point to consider as Katanagatari is fairly episodic. There is of course reference to past episodes every now and then, but for the most part watching an episode out of order wouldn't be particularly disturbing. If there was anything I could fault the story on, it would be dialogue. Katanagatari is extremely dialogue-heavy, which seems rather strange considering it's the story of swords. This heavy dialogue, coupled with longer episodes (45 minutes/epi) can sometimes leave you feeling a bit fatigued mentally, but nonetheless engrossed. A word to the wise though, if you aren't one for lengthy, uninterrupted conversations, this may not be the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nVisually Katanagatari is stunning. The animation style is unique and intriguing, albeit initially somewhat off-putting to some. It doesn't take long to start to really appreciate the style, nor the incredibly well-done animation. That being said, much of Katanagatari is* dialogue, and as such much of the episode is done with still-frames and perhaps a mouth moving up and down. But when action breaks out, and it always does, it's visually stunning and extremely well done. Movements are fluid and purposeful and the fight-scene animation remedies any drowsiness you may have felt from the dialogue earlier. Admittedly it's most of what you'll remember after the episode anyways, and if it weren't for me pointing this out now, you may have been surprised upon re-watching this series to see just how little action each episode contains. Nonetheless, animation, amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe score for Katanagatari is wonderful. The music is suspenseful when it needs to be, and drives the mood of each and every scene. And that is by definition, a well-produced soundtrack. The voice-casting is also very well done. Shichika in particular really stands out, as being a blank slate upon which experience is carved. And as the show progresses, his voice reflects his newfound confidence and purpose. And it's fortunate the voice-acting is so well done, because as I've mentioned numerous times now, with such a dialogue-heavy show, it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is somewhat episodic. This aspect of the show leaves character development in between a rock and a hard place. However, to say it's entirely episodic is incorrect. I would say it's more like the show can be viewed as episodic groupings. Through the course of the show though, the mounds of experience Shichika ascertains genuinely builds his character, and it's an interesting progression. Togame, being much more experienced from the start, has nowhere near as much to learn. Though she too develops alongside Shichika to an extent, for obvious reasons. More importantly, the characters in this show are just appealing. Each of them, from Shichika to Togame, from the Maniwani to Princess Hitei, has something about them that just works. This definition of character and personality, rather than it's development, really stands out in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed Katanagatari. In particular I rather enjoyed the ending. I wish more anime could end like Katanagatari. That's not to say all anime should, but it is extremely refreshing to watch something where your core is shaken up and tossed aside, and you're left just appreciating things for what they are rather than what you want them to be. These sorts of anime, and indeed plots as a whole, leave the greatest impact upon the viewer. And because of that, I think Katanagatari may go down as one of the best animes I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much more without spoiling anything, but Katanagatari is an experience I would recommend.\\n\\n\r\nCheers\\n\r\n~Marquis",

It has a very steady character development and story to with those fantastic characters.... I myself didn't give it an outrageous score but gave it a score fitting to how i reacted to the plot and how the outcome of that story and plot cameto be.  \\n\\n\r\nIts a great anime that has everything you might want in a mini-movie series, it has its humor, its romance (for those like myself that like their romance in their plots) and the action is on par with that of a few martial arts anime (just lacks in some areas, but that's my opinion).  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch for any long time anime lover out there!!!",

Makes you feel like you're going on an adventure. Epic trip. Epic feel trip..........\r\nArt: The characters are not drawn the usual way so it might be a bother to some. However, if you don't mind the characters' drawing, the rest is really well drawn.\r\nSound: The soundtracks are just epic and well chosen.\r\nCharacter: THE BEST CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT YOU'LL EVER SEE.\r\nThis anime really resembles Samurai Champloo  but is still very unique. Although the episodes might seem to last long (50 min), every minuteis well spent either on the plot or the character development. You won't be able to stop midways in an episode. The only reason why this anime is underrated is because of the character's drawing I think. If it weren't for that or the ending... I'd say it would almost be as good as Hunter x Hunter.",

            "content": "So what stood out? Well, the ending for one. It's violent and climactic and doesn't leave any loose ends. Another is the animation which is very unique especially the charter's eye's. Eyes in this world are not a white outer ring followed by a colored inner ring and a black circle. Each character has their own unique eyes. The main character has a black outer circle with a white center. Another character has house looking shape in the center of her eye. Another has these big yellow eyes with a black crescent on the bottom of them. You get a lot of time to lookat these eyes because much of this anime is dialogue (perhaps as to be expected of a light novel). The dialogue is charming and fits in nicely with the light tone and dry humor. This is side by side with lots of death and character's who ask to be killed. It is very interesting how this somehow manages not to kill the light tone even at the very end. A final thing that stands out is character development. The main characters grow closer over time and the male protagonist goes from more or less dead panning everything to developing emotions and a strong attachment to others. In sum, this anime is fun to watch and very entertaining. It's not mind blowing, it's not an anime that demands to binged watched, but it is an anime with a focused story, interesting characters, and a great sense of humor.",

I won't repeat what the synopsis says but I will say it is exactly as long as it needs to be, which makes the pacing perfect.  Every episode was aired originally one month apart over the course of a year which, incidentally, is exactly how much time elapses in the story from start to finish.  Every episode steps into the lives of the main characters on their year long journey, a choice that allows the relationships of the characters to progress quickly but also keep it believable.\r\nArt 10/10:  \r\nThis is a bigone here.  The art style is very unique in this anime and I absolutely adore it.  Every character is unique to the point that even if you removed all of their hair you'd still be able to tell them apart.  Besides the character's artwork the backdrops are also beautiful in their own right, and the action scenes are spectacularly animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:  \\n\r\nThe music is memorable and absolutely fantastic.  The voice acting is good and every character has their own unique laugh.  The unique laugh was a little strange at first but once I got used to it I actually really enjoyed it, maybe you wont but I found it satisfying.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:  \\n\r\nEvery episode they introduce more characters that are interesting and well rounded, even if they are never seen again.  The gives the effect that the world is really breathing and is full of people who have their own stories and lives outside of the main plot.  While watching I had this habit of putting the main characters into simple and straightforward archetypes but with each passing episode we learn more and more about the duo and you realize there is way more to them than your typical cut-out anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:  \\n\r\nThis anime was full of surprises and twists I simply did not expect and, without spoiling anything, the ending is bitter sweet is the best way possible.  The final episode just does everything right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10:  \\n\r\nHonestly, this anime just does everything right for me.  I could not recommend it enough.",

            "content": "My initial experience with this anime was pretty negative. Boring premise, dumb main character, childish humour, each episode having 50 minutes screen time. But that progressively changed. \r\nThe story itself stays very simple at first. Two people in search of 12 legendary swords.  But as you reach the final episodes and fully understand background for the plot it becomes something quite intricate. It made for quite a huge \"ooooh\" moment once I grasped the full scope of the plot. \r\nAt times it feels like the anime is playing with you. And it is. Clever meta talks, pop culture winks, archetypical characters with crazy personalities,fan service, some occasional trolling. Subversions clever directing tricks, self-aware characters. The anime is like a big game. \\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not all. While the style of writing can get pretty chaotic and all over the place, it also can be very striking, to the point, and emotional as well as intelligent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterwise I would call this anime pretty strong. There is a wide spectrum of minor characters. Each of them has unique personality quirks and some of them even have surprising depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are Shichika, the dumb strong main male character and Togame the tsundere smart main female character. At first I was very bored with those two. Togame with her klutz moments and constant blushing, Shichika with being as smart as bucket of nails. However gradually we see growth of their at first very convenient relationship which later blossoms into something very real, as well as their individual growth. Especially with Shichika who at first kills without thinking about it, but later begins to question not only reason why he must kill but also reason why he must fight. Togame\u2019s development is not as radical as Shichika\u2019s but she also receives some interesting emotional growth and especially her monologue together with Shichika in episode 12 showcases her great character that is not just being smart short tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nProduction is\u2026weirdly amazing. I am baffled as to how did they manage to make 12 episodes 50 minute show which span throughout the whole year. The animation is beautiful (btw. this anime has best looking kunais I\u2019ve ever seen.) the style is pleasant and unique. The Openings are fine; the endings are cleverly changing with each episode.  \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is top notch. From traditional Japanese music, to hip hop beats. Sound design is not something that I usually find myself liking or appreciating but this show sounded amazing. The voice acting is also great.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are some negatives; the pacing for me felt slow, some of the characters were annoying, the early humour still left me pretty cold, and some of the clich\u00e9 moments were boring. But it\u2019s not an anime which I could simply classify. It\u2019s much more than that. I have a feeling that there\u2019s a golden mine of undertones that I\u2019ve missed. Quite frankly this anime is a journey. Not only for the main duo but for you the viewer as well. It engages you, it plays with you, entertains you and it also moves you. It does all that while looking really great and sounding really great. What more could you ask?\\n\\n",

I've already watched it til episode 8 and i started to have doubts and eventually dropped it almost a year ago after learning what happens next, although, i had already forseen whats going to happen even with that in mind i can't prepare myself, i'm a sucker at this kind of stuff i can't take it, it is not what i expected at first. But i still manage to watch it til the very end after a year of mustering up my courage, but, i can't help my self not to well up. Butgladly i did and was very satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story and characters itself, well it's about a girl named Togame, a small weak fragile girl with a very short temperament shouting \"cheerio\" (not knowing what that really meant) as she burst out, but also she has some redeeming qualities, she is very beautiful with a long white hair (which makes her very cute) a very smart (a self proclaimed strategist) yet sometimes she can be very clumsy and gets really flusttered towards a certain someone and sometimes gets really jealous which is very kawaii to look at. She sets out to find the 12 legendary deviant swords for the Shogunate with her personal intentions hidden beneath her joyfull facade, unkowingly she stumbles upon the very strongest of them all Yasuri, Shichika the final and most perfect weapon ever made. Yasuri is a man with no knowledge of whatsover who lived alone with his sister in an island from the moment he was born, he doesn't feel love nor hate or even distinguish/differentiate the sex of a person wether if its a girl or a boy, he doesn't get aroused in front of a naked woman. he is by far naive but yet pretty much observant and aware of his surroundings. The likely pair with their unique set of qualities set out on an adventure full of adventures making history for themselves not knowing what lies ahead of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation, its very unique with its own originality i love the character designs i love how they blend the dark colors with thick lines, but as for the animation it's sub par to any action/adventure anime i know.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is great, it feels like i was really there in japan in that era it's very mesmerizing\\n\\n\r\nOver all i'd give it a 10 because i enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\\n",

The unique art style and twisted execution certainly never failed to keep my attention, but then the ending happened and it was like a slap in my face that completely spunme in the other direction. \\n\\n\r\nLet me just say that this anime has a pretty basic storyline, the protagonist meets someone who interrupts his daily, meaningless life and together they decide to go on a journey which lead them to follow their true destiny. If that was all there was to this anime then it wouldn't have gotten so many high reviews. The plot is what brings this story to life, the chain of events that take place, the character development, the journey itself. This anime is heavy on dialogue and it is a bit much sometimes, but I found that the communication between the characters added to its abstract nature. Nothing that took place really made sense in the usual way yet the characters all seemed to understand each other regardless and I could feel myself making sense of it too.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the ending came crashing down! It took away all meaning there could have been to all of these events and the character development was completely thrown back in the water. It was like being a spectator to a world that one day disappeared before my very eyes!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a corrupted gem so watch it at your own peril :'(\\n\\n",

            "content": "Similar to Bake and Nisemonogatari this is another anime created by Nisio Isin that has heavy dialogue and thrives on interactions between characters blah blah blah, we've all heard this before. We follow the story of Togame and Yasuri Shichika who, in there long journey, need to find all 12 deviant blades. Almost every episode is them trying to gain another sword and there adventure while Shichika learns more about fighting and Togame learns more about strategies in fighting, as she was the strategist of this group. For the main chracters I have to say I really did like Shichika, he is quite different frommany main leads as he is almost new to the world he is beginning to explore as he has never seen anyone other than his sister and father up until his first mission with Togame, making him an interesting character. As for Togame she was the smarts of the group although I didn't like her that much as she had the personality of a child up until the very end of the show. As for side characters, I honestly didn't understand the point of the maniwani group, they honestly felt like the team rocket of this anime where they would always end up losing in every episode. My few favorite side characters were Enmonzaemon and Maniwa Houou as they proved to be formidable opponents with great fighting scenes and they were overall just great characters in general.  This anime hits its high points near the end of the show as it takes a huge turn in a different direction, but still managed to keep it very entertaining. The episodes are 50 minutes long which was a little annoying at times because some episodes kept me bored while others kept me entertained. The action in this show is great but the plot might seem like it was completely pointless up until the end of the show. I would recommend this anime and honestly if it was a little shorter I think it would have been better, but that's just my opinion. If you liked Bakemonogatari than you will thoroughly enjoy this as well. Overall score: 7/10",

            "content": "What a pleasant and unexpected surprise was to watch Katanagatari! Episode after episode, the way this anime grew on me is hard to put down in words, but I'll do my best!;D\r\nThe plot is actually quite simple, the way it is developed, on the other hand, is masterfully done.\r\nWe have this stubborn and cute strategist, Togame, whose objective is to collect 12 legendary swords by the order of the current shogunate, who fears a revolt from those possessing the 12 Perfected Deviant Swords. After being betrayed by ninjas and samurais she seeks help of a man who lives exiled in an island with his sister.The 7th Kyoutouryuu head, Yasuri Shichika, an easygoing youngster whose only worries prior to Togame's arrival were training and living peacefully with his sibling, Nanami.\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting to know a bit more about the strange girl's past, Shichika decides on helping her on her quest and so they set on a journey full of joy and sorrow which will change their way of seeing the world and themselves, as well.\\n\\n\r\nSurprise is certainly the best word to define this series. Each episode lasts for around 50 minutes, but you can hardly feel those minutes going by. The art, characters and story are so rich and amazingly done that there wasn't a single moment of boredom while I was watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not your typical anime art, but any other than the one we have in it would look out of place. The sceneries, the characters, the whole atmosphere, everything is really beautiful, full of colors and details. You could say that the art itself would already be enough to give this anime a chance.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, this is not the only reason. The characters are outstanding, as well. Their expressions, their voice actors/actresses, their development, thoughts and reactions. All of it, is very much human and it was the major surprise I had while I was watching it. You can easily connect with the main character and with the side characters as well. The only letdown I had was the Princess Hitei - Emonzaemon part. I think they could've had a bit more development, specially on their past, but it's nothing that hinders the overall enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was the weakest point in Katanagatari. It ranged from perfect to average during the show, but the overall feeling is of a very good sound production.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a rare jewel in a time of so many cliches and average animes. Its beauty, the likable characters  and the involving story will definitely catch your attention till the very end.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is a charming, if formulaic, adventure focusing on the relationship between Yasuri Shichika, a veritable country bumpkin, and Togame, a high-profile employee of the shogun and self-proclaimed \"strategian\" as they strive to collect twelve very powerful swords.  Expectedly, Shichika and Togame contrast each other humorously, and this contrast is often what produces the witty, dry dialogue the show is known for.  In many cases, their completely different origins move the plot forward or cause problems.  \r\nEach of the twelve episodes of Katanagatari features a different sword and the struggle for the protagonists to obtain it.  Even though each episode isaround 50 minutes long, it would be going too far to say that they become boring.  Rather, each episode goes a lot like the other episodes and any remotely attentive viewer will pick up on the formula quickly.  However, the show is not episodic and the main story progresses interestingly.  There are a lot of things to pay attention to, even if the main plot of any given episode is somewhat obvious.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari's art is a mixed bag.  The backgrounds are extremely detailed and consistently gorgeous.  The characters tend to have exciting, if impractical, outfits.  The cartoony bright colors of the characters and their pleasantly simple faces contrast nicely with the scenery.  Here's the problem: the animation is frequently static and even lazy.  This is less of a problem because much of the show revolves around the dialogue, but even so there is far too much panning of the background and many shots seem to have been chosen to protect the budget, rather than to enhance the scene.  Fortunately, the dialogue and the quality of the voice-acting are good enough to distract even the most critical from many of the animation shortcuts.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari's characters stand out from the crowd in regards to the generic ones found in most animes.  Shichika's deadpanning and Togame's heckling go great together and sometimes it's difficult to tell if one of the characters was trying to be humorous.  Their relationship progresses so interestingly that the show would be worth watching just to listen to them converse.  Even characters that only appear for one episode or sit on the sidelines tend to be worth focusing on.  Every character's motives are understandable and the viewer will even find themselves caring about the \"bad guys\" like the members of the Maniwa Ninja Corps.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari is a great anime.  It's a must-watch if you can get over the predictability from episode to episode and the static animation.  The story is good throughout and has a lot of great themes.  Even though you will predict a lot, a lot will take you by surprise.  As an added incentive, the last episode is so great that it more than makes up for all of the show's flaws.",

Let's see how.\r\nFirst, you need a plot that will keep most people hooked up 'till the last second, and this anime surely did it, I mean, who doesn't like a tale of swords!?\r\nHowever, this is a bit different from the usual plot focused animes, mostly because in my opinion the real focus are the characters and how their relationship builds up and gets better each episode. I must also recognize the great character development on the side characters since many of them were rather interesting.\r\nIcan tell you that if you do find one of the side characters annoying it won't be a problem, so do not worry about such situation.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about flaws, Katanagatari is almost if not flawless, and has no plot holes whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also really crucial because it has the tough job of keeping the flow or pace of the episodes, and these being 50 min. long, I can say thankfully the OST didn't disappoint, it was relaxing and used when it had to be used.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was something else, at first there will be a need  to adapt to this art since it's really different from anything else, but once adjusted to it, the level of enjoyment will grow highly and there's a high chance you'll love it. Animation lived up to the success of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one disappointment of Katanagatari were one or two fights, mostly because of the lack of swordmanship or because of some precautions our main character had to follow, like for example he couldn't break any of the swords. By no means the action is bad though!\\n\\n\r\nBasically, all you need to do is sit back and enjoy this relaxing and intense, beatiful ride that is Katanagatari.",

            "content": "There's a tradition in Tibetan Buddhism called The Sand Mandala. Tibetan monks create intricate large-scale mandalas out of colored sand which often take days to complete. These large pieces of art often portray deities and complex geometrical patterns. After the piece is complete, the monks take part in a ceremony in which they wipe away the sand and destroy the mandala. Then, the sand is collected in a jar and sent out into the river, to be released back into nature, showing the impermanence of the world. I see this as a symbol for how one can't be too attached to anything, and how thingsin our lives come and go, and that's okay. \\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari reminds me of this tradition. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is something unlike anything I've seen. I've seen my fair share of anime, but Katanagatari showed me something I wasn't expecting. Everything from it's structure to it's pacing defies the traditional TV trope of the \"Fetch Quest\" narrative. A seemingly simple story: a curious and strategic girl searches for a right hand man on her quest for the twelve Deviant Blades across Japan, and we see their relationship grow with each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is fairly episodic, with the team getting another one of the swords at the end of each episode, and the pacing of the story is something to be admired. Admittedly, episodes can be a bit dialogue heavy, but it never felt rushed or dragged on for too long, which is an impressive feat for episodes that are 50 minutes long. They keep it packed with enough diverse content to keep the story engaging and episodes don't seem repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most interesting elements of the show, however, is the art. Character designs are simple yet imaginative, and colors are bright, bold, yet also subtle. The stylized scenery is always detailed and nothing 'looked boring'. I'm a huge fan of the style of this animation. Yet another unconventional strength of the show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters feature a lot of depth, and the romantic interest between the traditional 'brain and brawn' team kept it from being plain. I had almost even wanted them to introduce a third member of their two-man team, but realized that their relationship is a focal point of the series, and a third character would throw off the balance of their unique dynamic. Throughout the show I was always enjoying their interactions which kept an otherwise somewhat serious action/martial arts anime pretty light hearted. Side characters introduced along the way were also interesting with their backstories, but there definitely ended up being too many characters to keep track of. \\n\\n\r\n[Warning: LIGHT spoilers, mainly vague references] \\n\\n\r\nThe ending, however, is where I draw the connection to the Sand Mandala tradition. The highly controversial last episode first made me confused, angry, then upset, then content. The plot twists became overwhelming, but I had forgotten what show I was watching: Katanagatari isn't your traditional anime, and things weren't meant to last forever. This series isn't going to cater to the casual viewer, it's going to stay dedicated to its craft, and there's no way that there would be a predictable, one dimensional ending. \\n\\n\r\n[/LIGHT spoilers and vague references] \\n\\n\r\nIn general, Katanagatari showcased a lot of subtle elements that recent anime simple don't have. An unconventional show for the unconventional viewer. Plenty of action, clever dialogue, and great art. Great timeline and pacing. Katanagatari is a gem of its genre and is certainly worth the watch! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10 (rounded to 9)",

This anime has awesome story and i think all the characters are unique and each have their own story, even for some of the \"bad\" guys. There is however some imperfection to this anime as there is very little action scenes in each episode. I would love to have moreepic actions and battles. \\n\r\nThis anime also carries a lot of deep messages across such as facing your past and shortcomings. Even the 'bad guys' displayed loyalty, friendship and love and it was actually quite touching. Watch it for the story.",

            "content": "As I saw 1 episode, I will only be reviewing the series based off that one episode. It may seem unfair, but I will share why. Firstly this anime is by no means my kind of anime. I said to the people who recommended it that I hate romance, as well as fantasy, as well as some other things it includes. I put that aside thinking it might be alright though.\r\n1. The motivations make no sense. Ok people who want money will steal the valuable item, but honor? There is a distinct difference between receiving an honor (holding the sword) and having honor (loyalty). Theseswordsmen were not honorable. It's like being knights is an honor, but not if you're at war with the country. Putting that aside, 2 is actually on the subject of motivation too.\\n\\n\r\n2. On top of hating romance, I really hate forced romance. The plot is literally that she is forcing him (or trying) to love her, so he'll do what she wants. \\n\\n\r\n3. The action scenes are actually more cut aways. Flash to the aftermath each time, most of the time.\\n\\n\r\n4. The characters are very unlikable to me. I dislike them all. \\n\\n\r\n5. The humor falls flat to me. I did not laugh at all despite clear attempts to be funny.\\n\\n\r\n6. A swordless swordfighting style? No. It's just another martial art. That makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good, though I dislike the drawing style of characters. The sound was good from what I heard. It is overall a very average anime that is executed poorly and has absolutely no logic behind it. If you like it because it's not \"The usual\" even though it is, try your hand at some older classics. Also 12, 50 minute episodes? That's a 25 episode series, okay?",

It's really hard to \"score\" some anime, to give it a numerical value.  Gungrave for example.  There was so much I loved about it, but one aspect just ticked me off that it almost ruined the whole ride.  Katanagatari was like that.\r\nYou havea whole quest story all set up, throw in some bug eyed ninjas, cool japanese words that have cool deadly meanings, lets even have throw in some sexually suggestive behavior while we're at it.  It's all going so great.

            "content": "Without any summary fluff, let's cut straight to the point: \r\nthis anime was one of the best short series anime out there. Although it's not as renowned, the qualities of story, characters, artwork, and overall content are simply marvelous and unprecedented. \r\nThere are many interesting points to elaborate on in this anime; \r\nFirst of all, the story is quiet the surprise. Although the whole \"quest for finding swords\" seems rather cliche and (quite frankly) boring at first, this story takes on a whole new outlook that clearly distinguishes itself from other adventure stories out there. Because of the character development, interaction, and dialogues filled withphilosophy and humor, each episode approaches with a completely different feel.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, I was a bit (really, just a teeny tiny bit!) disappointed. Not because of the fact that I don't like the characters--given that I'm in love with our dense and naive Shichika--but more because of the development of relationship between Togame (heroine) and Shichika (hero). Although Shichika was supposed to be in love with Togame, his naivete and failure to make any initiatives sorta kept me on my toes as a girl who would love to see a touch of romance here and there to a beautiful story of a couple. \\n\\n\r\nTogame's personality irked me a little; I'm not a huge fan of Togame, who I can describe as selfish and spoiled. To completely stand back and look at the anime, she's not the pivotal character. No one is. Everyone has equal amount of contribution to her journey. It's her background that earned her the position as a heroine. My superficial complaint would be how her voice tone changes so drastically that it was a bit annoying to my ears. \\n\\n\r\nYasuri Shichika. Ahh, Shichika. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that Hosoya Yoshimasa was the voice actor. He did a great job of acting dense yet keeping keenness during battles as well as softness and unspoken love hinted when with Togame. He adjusted accordingly to Shichika's development and quite frankly, it wouldn't have been as good if it weren't for Hosoya Yoshimasa. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the fact that it lacked the romance that should be developing between a couple (but then again--it enhanced the character of Shichika who was supposed to be the thickheaded, dense guy), the interactions between characters seemed a bit unnatural; heroine and hero, Maniwa Groups, the sword bearers, and Princess Hitei and her servant Emonzaemon were all involved in this journey yet there wasn't much significant of a substance when they actually met. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the specific interaction between the protagonists and the antagonists (for example, Princess Hitei) was confusing yet so obvious and realistic. Can't say much without spoiling, but the fact that both the heroes and the anti-heroes have equal footing was interesting--and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork? No comment. Too good, must watch. Beautiful. Character drawings may be simple but simple doesn't mean boring. It turns out very elegant at the end. Blends in with the background which has subtle care in color, texture, and placement. \\n\\n\r\nIt confused me a little when in Edo era there'd be things like European style armors, guns, tux, and whatnot... and don't forget the costumes that resemble animals for Maniwa groups. It was a bit strange, but in a good way. Each characters were unique and I appreciate care put into every single character. \\n\\n\r\nTo those who don't appreciate dialogues, avoid this anime, or at least don't complain that it doesn't have a lengthy fighting scene. They talk a lot--but every sentence is nicely thought out that you'd be missing a big chunk without it. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogues, although they may not seem much, are one of the most crucial elements to Katanagatari. You'd be surprised by how captivating the conversation is, as well as by such clever, witty remarks going back and forth when humor intended. No wonder it aired once a month; it would require that much time to come up with meaningful dialogues. \\n\\n\r\nOverall story was good, but a bit of a shocking end to it; I have to admit, I almost threw my laptop because the ending angered me. But it all contributes to the story... just be prepared for the ending. Personally, I loved every second of this episode except the ending. Should I hint that I almost cried after finishing? \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to those who like cynical, a bit explicit, and both light-and-dark stories. It's not your ordinary action, shounen, adventure-with-romance story. It's much deeper. But seriously, go watch it now I guarantee you it'll be worthwhile.",

            "content": "So I was at first unsure whether I liked Katanagatari enough to continue watching. I didn't like the characters' visual design (particularly the weird eyes), and almost every element of the setup seemed forced for the sake of the plot. However, there were clearly some mysteries to solve, and I got a glimpse of what might be a complex plot with many complicated relationships and histories between characters so I kept watching.\r\nAround episode 5 or 6 I decided I liked it enough that I would watch it to the end. I liked that the story didn't seem to show any sympathy for its characters (noplot armor, you don't know when a new character might die), and I liked the way that the main characters were developing.\\n\\n\r\nAs I got into the later episodes some things started to annoy me. I am going to remain vague here to avoid spoilers, but don't keep reading if you don't already know more or less how the second half of the story goes. \\n\r\nI realized that an entire group of characters touted as being dangerous and mysterious from the beginning... weren't. All they seemed to do was die. Sure they happened to be going up against really powerful people (except the times they weren't), but this was hardly developed as a plot point. This group had been humanized, at least partially, already. Why didn't they curse their bad fortune that they were being so annihilated? Why did no-one marvel at the fact that such a powerful group was reduced to almost nothing so quickly? The entire group ended up feeling like a waste of time and character creativity, adding nothing to the story. They were really only ever used to show other characters' strengths (by losing), but even that I found mostly unsuccessful because we never actually saw any of them being strong. I never even really felt that bad for them, because none of them ever really expressed an engaging emotion besides \"I am sad that my friends are dead.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo then I watched the last episode. What. The. Fuck. One of the only (living) characters I cared about, and one that no small amount of time had gone into developing, was revealed to be a lie. The previous 12 episodes of character development were all essentially worthless. If that wasn't bad enough, the other character I cared about was completely reliant on the first. 12 episodes of gentle, subtle humanization turned into \"I'm gonna kill things until I die because.\" Not something human like revenge, or insanity, or a drive to fix the broken world that caused such events, just \"Eh, fuck it. May as well try to die.\" The remainder of the episode was spent destroying every goal achieved in every previous episode, while showing how meaningless each episode's struggle was because the MC couldn't use his full power.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the swords may as well have been normal swords. Half of the character development of the entire show turned out to be only superficial. Roughly half of the remaining development was immediately regressed. About half the characters (many of which had cool designs/premises) ended up being completely meaningless. Plenty of the mysteries that hooked me in the beginning were poorly explained, requiring many assumptions to be made interesting in the end. Any feeling of grief or despair in the final episode was robbed by the story itself. Any feeling joy was rendered equally meaningless. The last episode made the whole story empty. Meaningless. I grieve not for the characters but for the story that was lost. So many narrative opportunities that I thought were going to be used in ways I didn't see coming fell by the wayside and weren't picked up again.\\n\\n\r\nAs for good things? Some of the characters are interesting, and all of them had a different feel. While the soundtrack wasn't really my style, some of the songs really gave the right atmosphere to a lot of scenes. Also the different ending songs were cool. The story was able to surprise me a few times by the direction it took and by which characters stuck around.\\n\\n\r\nTL, DR: Watch Monogatari if you like weird and interesting characters, and enjoy a cliche-breaking disregard for those characters.\\n\r\nDon't watch Monogatari if you want to be able to finish it and look back at how far the story has come and how different thing are now. Because it doesn't come far. Don't watch if a story's missed opportunities make you just as depressed as a depressing story.",

            "content": "Based on Katanagatari's high scores here on myal, I decided to give Katanagatari a second go after putting it on hold for a very long time. I'm certainly glad I did as by the end of the series it went far beyond my expectations and will certainly be revisited at some time in the future. \r\nSeeing Katanagatari's character art style quickly began to stir comparisons to some older anime that I had watched in the past with the fastest one coming to memory being Casshern Sins. The simplicity of its elongated style of characters makes for better animation in my opinion and ultimately it workswell when you get into its greatly appreciated fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the journey of Yasuri Shichika, a practitioner of a family fighting style that uses his entire body as a sword, and an ambitious strategist Togame who elicits the help of Yasuri to hunt down 12 legendary swords by order of the shogunate. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest fore warning about this series is its format. With an hour long viewing for each episode understand that your in for some serious watching...and serious banter...I mean dragon ball z does not hold a candle to this anime in every literal sense of the meaning. There were only a selection of episodes that truly kept me engaged from start to finish and I feel like a shorter format could have made this anime much more welcoming. \\n\\n\r\nI found Katanagatari's biggest stand out to be in its character development and it was what mainly kept me moving forward with the series. The overall plot is very shakespearean which is not so apparent from the start and it is why I believe the anime has become such a stand out among the rest. \\n\\n\r\nIt's soundtrack is certainly helpful in setting both the light hearted antics and intrigue in the best times possible and was certainly enjoyable throughout. \\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari comes very close to a masterpiece work for me but it misses the mark with its hour long format and stretched out conversations. If not for this, I would have given it a much higher rating. None the less, the overall viewing of this series was certainly worth it and I urge anyone who may not have made it past the first few episodes to hang in there and give this one a look. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "It's taken me nearly 4 years to finish Katanagatari, mostly due to my own backlog becoming so extensive. To think that I started watching this series when I was a lowly freshman in college and finished it as a senior years later is surreal. But you guys aren't here to listen to me ramble. :) \r\nKatanagatari is one of Nisio Isin's serial works and is, in all honesty, really interesting in it's transformation from a standard 'fetch the sword' quest, to it's ultimate conclusion of being that something more. \r\nStory (8/10): Being a Nisio Isin story, it's not going to be simple. In fact there'llprobably be parts where the story makes no sense (that part actually comes along in episode 11, but spoilers kiddies). But the fact that it transforms over the course of the 12 episodes makes the story pretty fascinating. Shichika and Togame's quest across Japan for the 12 swords is detailed, filled with action, and some throw-ins in the form of comedy/romance/etc. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Katanagatari is brightly colored, all smooth lines, and filled with little details that make it a beautiful show. Thanks in part to the wonderful art by Take, this show had uniquely designed characters that just kinda lept off the screen with how vibrant and interesting they were. Plus the fight scenes are a real treat thanks to the great designs. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10): While the openings and endings were OK to me (the first is probably the better one, if I had to pick), the incidental music is what really sets the mood for the show. From very traditional Japanese music, to something that reminds me of rap, to slower jazz-ish sounding background music, these songs were what helped you really get into a scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10): The main draw to the show is it's main characters. Shichika and Togame are the most interesting duo that you'll come across, which makes watching them develop so much fun. Shichika starts out as an out of touch, muscle headed idiot with virtually no emotions to a hero that we have really be entertained by. Togame is much the same, beginning as a the devoted strategist who will complete her mission, to a girl who comes around to being more interesting. Both characters transformations are evident by the last episode, so paying attention to them during their travels makes the entire show worth it. \\n\\n\r\nAs well, Nisio Isin adds in some interesting secondary characters that just add into the whole experience, with the mysterious Princess Hitei and her servant Emonzaemon, the Maniwa Ninja Corps, and the Deviant Blade wielders. They add into the character of the show and make the progress on the main duo's journey all the more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): This show really does almost have it all: adventure, action, comedy, romance, tragedy, philosophy, and political intrigue. Thanks to hitting so many little pieces like that makes this anime really interesting. I was never bored, I had fun with the characters and the fight scenes. Hell, I even wrote a philosophy paper on Shichika's starting characteristics in the first and second episodes for a class. Katanagatari is entertaining to the end and you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari is another success for Nisio Isin, with it's interesting format, story, and characters. Even when the story was odd or the characters were rambling in that certain NI way, the payoff for this show was wonderful and I highly recommend that you check this show out.\\n\\n\r\n\"And so, we draw a close on Katanagatari this review.\"",

            "content": "Ah Katanagatari. What can I say about such a work of art? Yes, before going into this review I'm going to be honest and say i consider this I fine work of art. You can agree with me or not, but I'm going to list the reasons why I believe what I believe.\r\nStory: Katanagatari's story starts out fairly slow, which may turn off a few viewers at the start. I must admit I was skeptical about what i was getting into throughout the entirety of episode one. But Katanagatari is a series that really ends up grabbing a hold of your attention and never lettinggo. It's a story filled with light hearted humor that eventually descends into a torrent of seriousness. While abrupt, this shift is handled masterfully and shows that such things can be executed well within any medium.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art itself is a work of art. Masterfully rendered backgrounds do not lose any sense of realism despite their stylization. The characters themselves all have varying styles to them that work well within the context of the universe. So much so that it really doesn't feel that out of place when a ninja dressed like a praying mantis shows up. The animation itself is incredibly smooth and leads to a very believable sense of realism, despite all the fantastical feats of martial arts being used.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't claim to be any expert on music but I don't believe a sound was out of place. Music was always appropriate to the situations it was used in, even the hip hop tracks did not seem to far detached from what was happening within the story. Sound effects were great as well with every strike and slash being given its own sense of power.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While all the characters were incredibly well developed I feel the need to talk about one character, Yasuri Shichika. Never before have I seen a character so obviously grow in any series. With each fight being a lesson Shichika discovers what it means to be a person, instead of just a weapon.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Best series ever. That's all I can say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Katanagatari is a massive achievement in animation as a whole. With a well executed story, perfect sound effects, well developed characters and a beautiful art and animation style this is really a show that you shouldn't miss. It may start slow but your attention will be rewarded with one of the finest series that has ever been offered.",

            "content": "Katanagatari, as the title implies, is a story about swords. It all starts when Togame the \"Strategian\" ventured on an isolated island where Yasuri Mutsue and his family where exiled. Seeking help from Yasuri Matsue, a master of the sword art called Kyoto Ryu (Bladeless), to recover the 12 perfected deviant swords of the legendary sword smith, Shikizaki kiki. Upon arriving on the island via boat, Togame met Yasuri Ichika, the son and successor of Yasuri Mutsue on the Kyoto Ryu sword art. Since Yasuri Mutsue passed away, Togame had no other choice but to ask the boony Ichika for help on gathering the 12perfected deviant blades of Shikizaki Kiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the series were unique. Smooth during combat, The OP and ED were not that good in my view, but it certainly synced in with the feeling that the story gives. The environment music really matched the setting, making it sometimes unnoticed, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ups and Downs of this anime depends on the viewer. As mentioned by a lot of other reviewers, the anime is too wordy. Wordy in the sense that dialogues are long, but substantial, witty, and carefully planned. Usually a battle here wouldn't show the action because of the fast speed of swordslashes, Leaving the viewers to see only conversations in a lot of times. As per usual martial arts genre, a lot of unusual tactics, wits, and schemes are shown. Pointing out the weakness of one another, and yes, that adds up in the conversation.\\n\\n\r\nThe factor that i really liked about this anime is its uniqueness. The 12 perfected deviant swords were unique, the 12 Maniwa Head Corps were unique. Ichika's Sword style was unique, every perfected deviant sword owner was unique. Every Character backgrounds were unique in their own ways. Even the romance between Ichika and Togame was unique. I have to say, never seen anything quite like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari reminds me of Inuyasha, collecting pieces of the shattered jewels. Instead of shattered jewel pieces, they are trying to collect the 12 perfected deviant swords of Shikizaki kiki. Of course, other factions are also searching for the 12 swords, one of those factions were the maniwani, and as the story passes, more factions will rise in collecting the swords.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and plot twists were awesome, which i find very outstanding. May i also say that on the some revelations of things made me cry. One advantage of this anime of being wordy is that it left no question unanswered. After finishing the 1 hour~ per episode of the series, it left me satisfied and happy that i watched katanagatari. Am actually considering to watch this again. Highly recommended for anyone.",

            "content": "The diamond in the rough that is Katanagatari was first released in 2010 and is based on the light novels written by Nisio Isin. That name alone should be enough incentive for people familiar with the author to start watching now, I myself have to admit I feel ashamed that I never took the time to watch this show up until recently when it blew me away, Why? Let me explain.\r\nPlot- People like plot, right? And I'm not talking about that kind of \"plot\" that you see saturate the anime industry as of late with fan service being the sole part of the anime. Wellkatanagatari has you covered, the premise of the plot may seem very simple at first: Collecting 12 swords over the course of 12 episodes. However below the surface this show captivates you with deeper meanings and moral's behind each 50 minute episode. Just make sure you're prepared for the epic finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- As always Nisio Isin has characters completely nailed. In pretty much every episode a new character is introduced and yet they all feel solid and thought out. No copy and paste cliches and for all the recurring characters you are able to see some beautiful character development of some of the most soulful characters in the anime industry. Just like the rest of the monogatari series written by Nisio Isin there will be plenty of monologue to thicken out their personalities, asking themselves why they are fighting? (and the answer won't be a cliche of \"too get stronger\")\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound- The art style is an acquired taste in my opinion, however for me it works perfectly. It is beautiful in it's own right, making it extremely refreshing and stand out. In terms of music and sound, I don't know how much you value opening's and endings but I unfortunately think that they are a little underwhelming for otherwise such a great show. In terms of OST however I think this show has overall one of the best, if not the best soundtrack I had the fortune to witness. It is truly a visual and auditory work of art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion- Just like Nisio isin's other work I rate this show extremely high and stands proudly on my recommendations to friends and my greatest anime list. Despite getting such positive praise for me I do believe that others may not see this show as that great of a feat. As stated before the show, like the rest of the monogatari, is filled with heavy monologue and dialogue bringing each episode up to the 50 minute mark. Along side the quantities of dialogue, names will also be thrown around at high pace so a decent amount of attention will be needed to sit through a whole episode. That being said, the author makes these other wise dull scenes extremely entertaining to watch, making you think and question yourself at times about moral questions. In conclusion it's an outstanding anime that is often neglected and I would happily recommend people it and watch it myself again.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR- If you like bakemonogatari or nisemonogatari you will love katanagatari. Great music, art style, fight scenes and characters. Long episodes and monologue/dialogue may put of some people but the author kept it interesting, all worth the end. \\n",

            "content": "So I thought it might be fun to review this one.\r\nThere's lots of people claiming this show to be a masterpiece, and while I disagree on that notion, I still think it was a very good show.\r\nEven if it didn't really impress me that much until the final episode.\r\nActual review starts here: minor spoilers might be included.\r\n--Presentation (Visuals & Sound).\r\nKatanagatari has a very unique style to it, However I wouldn't go out of my way to call it too far from most peoples comfort zone.\r\nThe character designs are different mostly from other anime regarding the eyes and body proportions and the backgrounds are hand painted/drawn.\r\nNottoo unconventional, and it looks quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the music in the show, I liked all the openings and ending songs, and the background music mostly fit as well with the exception of the few hip hop/rap songs they used, which I was not a fan of, even though they did usually fit the theme.\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid, the backgrounds are nice and the music was mostly very good.\\n\r\nI have no real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\n--Story.\\n\r\nWith the word story being in the title you would expect this to be the highlight of the show, but no I thought it left room for improvement (but still was above average).\\n\r\nBasically a dude and a girl get together and set foe a quest to find all 12 deviant blades, while another faction that wants the blades is also on a hunt for them.\\n\r\nThe goal is simple, avoid getting killed and collect blades.\\n\\n\r\nI do have some complaints about the story.\\n\r\nFor one, the entire plot is basically a glorified fetch quest, like when an NPC in a video game tells you to go collect X amount of bear asses or something.\\n\r\nAnd the reasoning behind the whole quest wasn't much better than what mos video games offer either.\\n\r\nThe other part I thought could be improved was the romance, in episode one it just kind of happens and then they hint at development, while not really doing anything and about episode ten they hold hands.\\n\r\nThe actual development was so slow I thought they were way past that point at the time. \\n\r\nHaving more of a focus on the relationship of the two main characters would have added a lot more emotional impact for the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is episodic, as expected and while that's not a bad thing it does tend to make the show a bit predictable.\\n\r\nThe story is also told mostly through dialogue and that could turn some viewers off.\\n\r\nI myself am not a fan of this type of storytelling, but they managed to pull it off pretty well.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters.\\n\r\nThere's basically three types of characters in this show, the main duo, the people who wield the deviant blades and the ninja faction.\\n\r\nThe ninja faction is fairly quirky but pretty pointless regarding the story, as they are mostly an annoyance to the main cast and don't affect the plot for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe blade wielding masters are a bit more interesting, they all have their own reason for fighting and risking their lives.\\n\r\nAnd while they usually only get a single episode of development, they are about as interesting as\\n\r\nthe main cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now about Shichika and Togame.\\n\r\nShichika is a person who is also considered a blade an Togame is a strategician.\\n\r\nFor the largest part of the show their relationship boils down to the guy who fights and the girl who thinks, but towards the end of the series there's at lest a little bit of further development.\\n\r\nI kind of dislike how they both got a good backstory, but the implications of those were pretty much ignored.\\n\r\nThe characters were still definitely a big part of this show's appeal.\\n\\n\r\n--summary.\\n\r\nThe way Katanagatari keeps itself interesting is with jokes, rapid introduction of new characters, the unique art style and some fight scenes.\\n\r\nSurprisingly it never felt like it had to stretch itself too thin, despite the simplistic plot.\\n\r\nThe execution matters, and Katanagari was nicely done.\\n\r\nI could say that this is a show worth checking out for pretty much anyone.\\n\r\nWhile I didn't see it as a masterpiece it was still fun all the way through.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is one very unique and beautiful piece of art and I highly emphasize the word \"art\". It may not be for everyone but if you give it a chance, you may see what truly makes it spectacular. In that sense, it reminds me a lot of the Bakemonogatari series. On the surface this may seem like a simple fetch quest story about collecting these demon swords with childish character designs. However, there is so much more than what meets the eye in this series. The art and designs may seem simplistic at first but look deeper and you'll see a masterfully animated world fullof tiny intricate details that just reeks of style. And hidden within are darker and thought-provoking themes of revenge, purpose, self and death.\\n\\n\r\nThe defining strength of this anime is the relationship and romance between Togame and Shichika in particular the witty and masterfully scripted dialogue between the two MCs. But be prepared. There is a LOT of dialogue and it very rarely stops. But as I said, the dialogue is top-notch and what drives the character development. The banter between Togame and Shichika almost never gets old whether they are piling on jokes or delving into deep philosophies. And the action (when it finally does come around between all the talking) is excellently done although it can be short at times. Each episode is 45 mins in length and this is both good and bad in a sense. It's good in that each episode's story gets fully developed and it helps drive the character development. However, it makes each episode a bit more of a challenge and a chore to go through along with the simplicity and predictability of the story, amount of talking and overly episodic nature of the series.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this is a unique gem that should be watched and appreciated by all anime lovers. Katanagatari may not be for everyone but if you liked Bakemonogatari or want to try something that is a bit different, definitely give it a shot. \"Cheeeeeeerioooo!\"\\n\\n\r\n8.25/10",

            "content": "I'll start by saying I watched the entirety of the Monogatari series (or as much as been released as of date of writing) before watching this, and came in with very high expectations. I even avoided watching this for many months as I was expecting something just as psychological that would make me think just as much, and simply didn't have the time to think before.\r\nKatanagatari did not meet those expectations so I was pretty disappointed after watching it. I'd highly recommend, unlike me, watching Katanagatari first and then the Monogatari series, as that may significantly impact your enjoyment of this show.\r\n----- Characters - 6/10------\\n\\n\r\nMany people say that the characters are where Katanagatari really shines. I feel that's a horribly ironic statement, given that the majority of the 30 or so characters exist for all of one episode and disappear so fast it's hard to remember anyone's names. If Katanagatari really wanted to focus more on the development of the two main characters, I'm very confused why they spend about half the show on characters that bear practically no importance to the series as a whole (AKA the entire Maniwa Corps).\\n\r\nAs an important note, each episode of Katanagatari is a little over twice as long as your normal episode, so consider how you would feel watching 12, 24 minute scenes of filler just so you could see the \"good half\", which I can't say is all that good to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of the show is also frequently lauded, but I'd say any development has a huge, fatal flaw -- the main characters of the show, and the only ones who are developed to any significant extent, are by far some of the least interesting characters in the whole story. The majority of the cast all have fairly interesting and detailed backgrounds, yet they remain largely undeveloped. Unlike them, the two the main characters' backgrounds can be summed up in one sentence.\\n\r\nWe can't learn more about the characters as the story progresses as we already know almost everything about them from the first episode. Yes, they do change and grow as their journey moves forward, but these changes are extremely predictable because we already know everything about them. There's nothing hidden and there are no parts of their personalities we don't know; as such it's really difficult for any development to catch you by surprise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Katangatari really excels at though, is the ways in which it depicts the main characters attempting to learn and make sense of the world around them and people they meet. If Katanagatari had done more of this and spent less time on worthless characters (or actually developed those interesting characters instead of throwing them off to the side...), I would likely have a totally different opinion about the series as a whole, but it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nMany people also say that the dialogue between these characters is where Katanagatari shines. Again, considering half the series is spent on characters that bear no importance, I feel that this is a very tough statement to defend. This is really exemplified by the first episode, which has about 20 minutes of straight taunting. And what is the build up of those 20 minutes of taunting? 2 minutes of fighting... Not exactly worthwhile to listen to all that. The dialogue in the last few episodes does actually become pretty interesting, but I can't say it was worth the wait.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----- Art - 6?/10 -----\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so this one is pretty hard to compare as it's of a totally different style than most anime. As this is dialogue heavy though and has very few minutes of battle time, it definitely can't compare to some of the spectacular animation that's been produced in the past few years.\\n\r\nMonogatari has lots of crazy shots, angles, and compositions that hold you out through the long bouts of dialogue, as well as many, many insane action scenes, but Katanagatari does not have any of the former and only has a few minutes of good action the entire series. The other 10 total minutes of action in the show are negligible.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----- Sound - 7/10 -----\\n\\n\r\nThe sound really blends in well with the art and tone of the scenes, enough so that sometimes you don't even notice it. There's at least a few really good tracks, including the main battle theme.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----- Story - 3/10 ------\\n\\n\r\nEasily the worst aspect of this series, it can entirely be summarized as \"12 episodes, 1 for each sword\". I'm fine with stories that are intentionally simple and focus on other aspects of the show, as many stories can become overly complex and increasingly filled with plotholes as they progress. Unfortunately, Katanagatari has a very strange focus on the story in the second half of the series, where the initial simplicity becomes an unnecessarily complex beast, with significant chunks of time spent on explanation and exposition, and yet we still have many questions left unanswered by the end of the it.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of this complexity, as far as I can tell, is for the extended metaphor that underlies the whole show. While normally this would really peak my curiosity, it's practically spoiled by the very title of the show and repeated many, many times throughout the series, in such a way that all of the impactful scenes of the show are not unexpected, which really brings the impact way down. There are some surprises in the series, that being said, but few of them really impact the characters in a meaningful way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----- Enjoyment - 3/10 -----\\n\\n\r\nYou know, I'd probably have enjoyed this more if half of the dialogue wasn't idle banter of no comedic, emotional, or plot value. With a show so dialogue heavy having so much useless dialogue, it's not surprising that I fell asleep many times in the middle of episodes and eventually actually used this show as a means of getting myself to fall asleep at night (I'm not even joking when I say this actually helped cure my insomnia).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n----- Overall - 6/10 -----\\n\\n\r\nThere are things Katanagatari does really well. I wish it did more of those things. Unfortunately, it spent half the show on useless characters and another chunk trying to make the story more complex, instead of on the things it does really well.",

            "content": "As i have not finished the entire series yet. I could be biased on this review on not seeing a bad ending for it yet. And as my profile shows I have never written a review even for anime that I think are potential candidates for 10/10. So bare with me if i must come back to fix this review, but this anime in particular has had plenty of fine points to already discuss. Expecially for a adaptation from around I believe 2009-2010 I could be wrong wiki gurus will chow me to bits for it. I accept.\r\nI find this anime tickling a great sinceof what I tend to miss sometimes when enjoying a good anime. I give the story a 9. Its very up front and has had a very nice linear progression so far. Its faster paced. Still shows alot of love for the background. It unfortunately does not get a 10 only because of character which Ill get to in a moment. The story has been fullfilling with some nice twists along the way. Its as much as i can say without ruining something you might be watching. \\n\\n\r\nArt im going to glance over. While I gave this a 8 for art. I will say that it grew on me after watching alot of the \"Traditional anime\" and I think works for the type of setting and story they were wanting to create. By the end Ill most likely feel like bumping this to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there isnt alot of \"Music\" the distinct sounds for each area they travel to are distinct and make a pleasant sensation of progression through different areas of what is Japan. Along with very good usage of battle sounds. Not overbearing; but to enunciate something critical that the eyes and ears can both enjoy. Sounds stands at a resounding 9.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some anime tends to fall short on character development. This anime shows promise so far on each of the characters to grow and expand from when we first meet them. I give this a 9 only cause the two main characters so far are so ying and yang that its harder tell. Specifically Tomaga as its harder to tell if she is progressing as a character at all even though she will be. With Shisika he shows both growth in strength and in character as he learns more about the world he has missed out on. Therefore characters is a good 9 for me. On the side note of story. While not every anime can be perfect Tomaga is what keeps the story at 9. As she is only semi known on who she is after the amount of episodes that ive watched.\\n\\n\r\nBetween Enjoyment and Overall ill lump into one number even though I have two. 8.75. If you have been burning on anime and want something that is relaxing but still has action. I would watch this anime. Its light. Action. And development that gave a great sense so far of fulfillment. Definitely something to just relax and enjoy if your feeling burned out on the standard stuff that comes out today and just want to relax. \\n\\n\r\nHopefully this helps someone. As I wouldnt say its a go to anime. But a refreshing breather for those who need it.\\n\\n\r\nHappy watching,\\n\r\n-Zelda\\n\\n\r\nEdits:\\n\r\nReworked to nines across the board. Everything the storytellers wanted. They got. Enjoy the ride...",

The show begins with minimum violence for the genre. It continues like this, only seeing a few bits of blood every so often. It was almost hidden. Then around episode 7 it started going down hill. It got worse and worse until it became a huge slaughter fest. I thought this was a swords man anime, not corpse party! The unrealistic elements of the show became too much. The only part that I liked throughout the anime wasthe art style. It was drop dead (mind the pun) beautiful. Oh, and for all you people who enjoy it, their is a handful of fan-service, both female directed and male directed. This is my overall review: Watch until episode 6 and stop. Unless you like blood just like a shark does, then be my guest. Not only that, but the feels is going to hit you like a truck and rip your heart out while it's at it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",

It started well, plateaued to just good, and then finished really strong, but had a meh resolution after the key ending. \r\nI did really like some of the unconventional romance between Togame and Scichika. It was endearing and pretty funny at times. It did annoy me some of the times where Togame's complete failure at communication caused relationship tension (as it really irks me when this is overplayed), but outside of that I highly enjoyed it.\r\nThe story progression was solid, and I liked the protagonist characters. The villains were fine but they could have been a little more exciting. Especiallythe Maniwa Corps with the exception of the main head. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had any major complaints about the show it would be that the story felt almost too smooth. I felt like until the climax of the show, I could kind of see everything coming. The way they got one sword every single episode did that make the show paced well, but also very predictable and as mentioned too smooth. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said though, I loved the last two episodes. They were dank. Not exactly the resolution I was hoping for, but the climax was freaking great. This is a good show, but definitely not great. A solid 7.0",

The character design in this anime is diverse and colorful.

            "content": "I won't write reviews like others do, I have my own style of reviewing an anime I loved. (Minor spoilers) ''CHEERIO!''\r\nThere is just so much that happened in the anime, that I do not know where to start...\r\nWhen I started watching the anime I saw a girl and a boy that were about to travel together. Of course my first thought was ''Oh it's one of those anime's again''. I wholeheartedly regret that I even had the nerve to think something like that. Every single episode had a deeper laying meaning, every episode covered a new story for a new character.  Every episode wasbeautiful to it's core... I can't express in words only how grateful I am that this anime existed. \\n\\n\r\nStory,\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the story is about a boy and a girl who'm are starting a new story together. Traveling around the world collecting blades. Pretty straight and boring concept right? Well, your right about that part, but that doesn't make the anime. What does make the anime is how the story will develop. Not only did the story develop to my liking, it developed in a way that every single episode was satisfying to watch. Every single episode had at least one interesting character with an unique personality. You really developed a liking to almost every character in the anime, and honestly, it hurts the most to see that one has to be defeated. Even though as hard as it is, they even kept an amazing great moving forward story in it. As for that reason I can only give the story a fully deserved 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt,\\n\r\nAt first you'll think by yourself ''Haha, what a weird animation''. But honestly, I see no other fitting art/animation for this anime. It's perfect, it's simple and it balances out the anime in a funny way. Not only will you adapt to the animation very quickly, but after finishing the anime you crave for more anime's with animation like these. Therefore I will give the art a\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound,\\n\r\nIt had everything. When the anime got serious, when there was a comedic part, when there was an emotional part or when they were fighting. Every single soundtrack had a great impact on every single moment in the anime. Not only did the soundtrack fit with the right moments, it also did with the animation itself. Therefore I cannot give the soundtracks in the anime lower then a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter,\\n\r\nNow, I can finally go deeper in on the characters. First of all I want you to know that ALMOST all the characters were amazing, you will most definitely take a liking in everyone. They did great explaining where they came from, what they did and how they became the person who'm they are now. Coming up with all those different stories, with all those different personalities and being able to convert it in the anime is nothing shortly then witchcraft. I can't point out how great they are, and words and numbers can't express how good the character/characters development was.\\n\r\nBut what if I say that I give the characters a 11/10?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment,\\n\r\nRead everything above you'll be able to understand that my personal enjoyment was god damn out of the fukkin roof boi.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall,\\n\r\nGreat anime, with great animation and an even greater character development. Overall a really enjoyable and great anime to watch. Not only will the anime hurt you deep down inside, it will also give you a satisfied feeling. Believe me, the anime will hurt you, but also satisfy you. You'll understand when you've watched the anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nHave fun watching the anime! '\\n\r\n''However by that point, you'll have been torn to pieces''.",

            "content": "I found this anime very deep and intriguing. The story was a good mix of drama, comical, romantic and serious. The art style is absolutely beautiful from the scenery to the characters. The character development was great when considering each episode was split by entire months in both the real world and in the show. The growing romance between Shichika and Togame was a beautiful thing to watch and at times pulled on various emotions. My expectations were well exceeded and had me wanting more even after the conclusion of the series. As a person who has no issue with heavy amounts of talking, Ireally enjoyed the show. Though, the ending was slightly difficult to handle for someone as emotional as me. The show will make you laugh and cry. Overall, I highly recommend this anime for anyone that likes beautiful art, amazing stories, rich characters, historical settings, and having their emotions brought out. It has become part of my top ten anime.",

            "content": "ONE OF THE WORST ANIME I'VE WATCHED.\r\nI'm being serious here. Basically it's about the journey of our mc and the heroine to collect 12 swords (1 episode=1 sword). So what makes it terrible in my opinion? First off let's start with the action, even though it's an action anime it's actually 95% dialogue 5% action, are you hoping for an epic fight? then you shouldn't watch this anime because it doesn't exist here, the enemies got defeated very easily (sometimes it doesn't even shown on screen, yes it's that ridiculous).\r\nBut I might still be able to accept that (since I really liked Zetsuen no Tempestwhich in some episodes is even 100% dialogue). What makes it the worse is that I can't even connect to the story, I found it hard to have any emotional attachment to it since the mc is abstain from having human emotions (even though he developed later on I still can't relate to him). It also failed to make me interested enough to the side characters (the maniwani is so BS they served almost no purpose to the story) and I doesn't even care what happens to them.\\n\\n\r\nRomance? Can't feel it either. The relationship between the characters feel so weak and unnatural. The only good thing about this anime is the interesting designs of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the worst part, it's the ending which is SO FREAKING TERRIBLE, I won't give spoilers but you would feel like what you felt after finishing episode 2, \"it ends just like that?\", \"what's even the purpose of the story\" ,\"I wasted my time\" is what I thought after finishing the last episode. Still can't understand how this anime got such high ratings on MAL, their high rating is what kept me going on (since I thought something good would happen later on) even though I'm on the verge of dropping it . This is the first time I give a rating much lower than on MAL (usually it's pretty close) and I'm soo disappointed (feels like the good reviews were just trolls).",

            "content": "Katanagatari was suggested to me out of the blue one day by a friend and I simply brushed it aside, saying I would watch it at a future time. Cut ahead to 4 months later and I decided \"What the heck? Why not?\" Firstly, I'm quite glad I watched this show. It's a unique premise with good characters and good fluidity throughout. Right off the bat, I recommend this show to anyone, especially someone who's really into feudal Japan and that sort of stuff.\r\nDuring the period of the Owari Shogunate, the military 'stategian' is sent out on a mission to collect 12 powerful blades createdby the legendary swordmaster, Shikizaki Kiki. However, she is quite frail. In order to accomplish her task, she gets the aid of a man who has lived for 20+ years in seclusion on an island with only his sister to keep him company. This man holds the power of Kyotouryuu, a sword style that uses no swords. Together they set off on a journey to collect the 12 deviant blades by fighting and winning battles against the men and women who own the swords.\\n\\n\r\nNow from what I just described, the story seems like a typical fetch-quest scenario. Find sword, beat owner, collect sword, repeat. What I enjoy about this story is not so much the plot itself, but how the plot is laid out. There are 12 episodes, each lasting about 50 minutes (though I believe there was a 2013 version with double the episodes, but each one was standard length; same story, different format). Anyway, this number 12 is very significant to the show and pops up over and over again. The journey Shichika and Togame take is 12 months. There are 12 deviant blades. There are 12 members of the rival ninja corps who are also seeking the blades. This setup is really well done because it leaves you with what you'd expect. Each episode is dedicated to finding and getting 1 sword, killing 1 member of the Ninja corps (with some exceptions), and when the show aired originally, it literally aired one episode a month. The fact that each episode is the length of 2 standard anime episodes also means there is enough time for each event and explanations to be given. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are probably what this show does best, thought the other things are quite amazing as well. Shichika is the powerful, yet slightly thick-headed one that does the fighting, Togame is the weak, but smart counter to Shichika's incompetence, and all the Ninja corps members and Swordmasters feel unique and interesting, ranging from a forsaken heir to a temple to the leader of a dojo to a little girl with the strength of an elephant. They make a lot of these side characters who only have 1 episode of screen time memorable and that's something lots of shows need to strive towards doing.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is also really quite good. The characters have this weird style about them with really round eyes and really sleek, straight figures, but it looks good. Fight scenes are often a joy to watch, as they should be, given the plot. The backgrounds are actually something I found really cool because they look like Japanese paintings, which really set the tone.\\n\\n\r\nSound is better than lots of shows, yet also not. It's better because I am left after I've finished this show with some of these songs in my head, but some of them aren't great songs as they are, simply memorable. It's also such and eclectic mix. It ranges from techno pop to, I kid you not, a song that sounds like a woman is 'doing something' in the background. Still good enough though.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was so close. SO close to being near perfect. But the ending did something. The ending wasn't bad by any means, but what it did was change the show itself. All of Katangatari is fun, vivid, bright, and humorous. However, there are some tragic events for Togame and Shichika that lead to an ending that is dark and sad and brutal. It doesn't belong with the show it's in, so even though it's a good ending, that doesn't excuse how so out of place it feels.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Good opening and ending themes\\n\r\n+Stunning animation and relatively nice sound\\n\r\n+Amazing characters that are interesting and memorable; even some side-characters are well-developed\\n\r\n+Great mix of humor, romance, and action\\n\r\n+Small thing: A character gets a catchphrase, and unlike lots of other shows, THIS ONE ACTUALLY USES IT CONSISTENTLY\\n\r\n+Ending itself was good, all things considered, it just really doesn't fit the show well at all\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-...like it REALLY does not fit at all. Ugh\\n\r\n-The tragic circumstances that lead up to the ending, while nice and all for plot development and character growth, feel kinda shoehorned in to the point where I don't think it was all that necessary\\n\r\n-Episode 7 had a weird animation style, and while it wasn't bad at all, this is the only episode with a different animation style and it's a very slight change, but it's weird and I don't know why that is.\\n\\n\r\nI really, really, REALLY wanted to say this show was near perfection. The ending just completely prevents me from saying that. However, I still highly recommend this show regardless of the ending. For one, you may find the ending to be good; everyone has different opinions after all. Also, the 11 episodes before the ending are amazing to watch and very enjoyable for any anime fan. I wish I could say it was near flawless, but it just isn't...for me at least.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why Katanagatari gets an 8/10 (really wish it could've been at least 9)",

Be it the conversations, the funny/humorous moments or the unusual swords and opponents.\r\nThe 50 minute episodes might seem long at first, although they feel much shorter in reality. I never had the feeling like an hour passed after watching an episode.\r\nSo yeah, that's it from me, I hope you'll enjoy Katanagatari as much as I did ifyou decide to give it a try.",

            "content": "Katanagatari\r\nKatanagatari is an adventure anime with some action and touches of comedy. This would be rated PG-13 for the blood spill. I recommend if you don't like the pace of the first two episodes I suggest you watch something else because it might be to slow for you.\r\nStory:\r\n9.5/10\r\nFirst episode got me interested  in the plot and after that the rest of the episodes tend to keep me interested. The plot is quite simple but it works. They introduce the main characters and after that it's an opponent for each episode. In the episodes of fighting the opponents it represents one month in which theydevelop the opponents background of the main character. It ended very well, the last episode surprised me then left me satisfied until the very last moment. (Hint: Watch the whole episode through just don't cut it off when you see credits.) My only complaint is the second episode and they were trying to explain to give some background and it was quite boring. Other than that they used the time to their advantage. I also liked the pace. I don't have to have action all the time and I like dialogue when executed right.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nSince the artwork is so different it puts the story in a different view. At first I thought the artwork was odd but it got me interested into watching it.This anime utilizes very bold and rich colors. I love the textures, the lines and the backgrounds. It looks quite simple (the character designs) but it's complex(the background and it's details) at the same time because of all the different textures used.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\r\nThere are no horrible voice actors with too soft voices or creepy deep voices for females. I enjoyed the narration as well that gave it a different feel to the story. I love the background music. Along with the art and story the background music sets the anime to be really enjoyable. The beginning and end song was okay for me considering how much I liked the artwork and story. I felt it could have been better. There are very few animes that get me interested in their theme songs so I'm not going to count Katanagatari theme songs too hard against it just because I wouldn't buy the soundtrack,lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nAll the characters that are introduced are utilized in the story. I also liked how the opponents that Yasuri Shichika fought were developed in their own episode as well. You see the main character grow as well which is a treat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nI was really turned off by the second episode and that chunk of dialogue that I felt was a waste. They could have found better ways to lay it out but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I looked forward to it every month and finished it so that says something for itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI would give it a 9/10 being the least. I really enjoyed this anime and I would watch again. I would recommend this anime to someone who likes action but can handle a story at a moderate place not filled with slapstick comedy when there is no fighting.",

            "content": "When I got this anime I had high hopes and high expectations, but the show turned out to be another Dragon Ball Z.\r\nThe story is mainly about two people (in ancient times) having to collect a series of 12 swords to help prevent a rebellion against the current government of Japan. One of these two people (Shichika) is a martial artist who takes the roll of a sword/weapon to help protect and fight for Togame. After fighting a supposedly powerful ninja, their journey begins.\r\nThe art is fairly plain, but when you have to make 45 minute episodes, the art is probably going to be lessfocused on so the story and backgrounds of the characters can be brought into the light.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said it was like another Dragon Ball Z, I was referring to when one of the characters jumps up really high and then says a few paragraphs of dialogue before their attack finally hits.... that's the kind of likeness I was referring to. The dialogue was spoken fairly fast all the time, but not only that, but also had so much to say so quickly, forcing me to pause quite a bit so I can actually keep up with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters didn't really have a lot of development to them. Even though there is a lot of dialogue, there isn't much character development given. The dialogues quite often are about fighting styles and it gets very repetitive and downright boring after a while. 10 minutes of dialogue and 30 seconds of action... isn't really my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I only saw half of the series, I would say that I have had some enjoyment watching this show. It had some unique ideas and it was placed in a historical setting, making me want to learn more about that time in history and the way the traditions were back then. But I found myself getting bored a lot, 40 minutes of dialogue and planning isn't really something I enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this show was good. It had some unique perspectives through out, but the over use of dialogue is apparent. There are pros and cons, but in the end the show is good and worth giving a try, but whether it deserves more than an attempt to watch, is entirely up to you.\\n\\n\r\n~~Subs Used~~\\n\r\nMazui",

            "content": "Katanagatari, as the name implies, is a story about swords. It isn't just a story featuring swords: It's literally a story about swords. It's a story about twelve 'Deviant Blades' made by the legendary Shikizaki Kiki, the sword-collecting journey of Shichika and Togame, and the side-characters who wield the Deviant Blades. It's also a story about the 'Maniwa Ningun', but I won't spoil anything about them.\r\nThe story starts when the main character, Shichika (master of Kyotouryuu), meets Togame (a strategist). Togame ropes Shichika into going on a sword-collecting journey, and that's basically it. But the things that happen on this journey (and the revelations insome episodes) are what really matter. The writing is brilliant (thank NisiOisiN, author of the Monogatari series, for that), and the masses of dialogue just add to the brilliance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all likeable, at least to me. Shichika is a somewhat deadpan human weapon (of sorts), Togame is cute and clever, and there's even a penguin ninja. If that doesn't interest you, I don't know what will.\\n\\n\r\nThere's an action scene in every episode, which is good (there's also an off-screen battle that was used as a joke). The animation (which is consistently good) makes these scenes better. Katanagatari is quite violent at times, but has a kind of 'soft' artstyle (which I liked a lot). I think the animation is good because of the dialogue scenes, which don't require much animating, but the dialogue scenes are good, so I'm happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs of this anime are all decent at worst, as is the OST (which shines when it really needs to). The voice-acting (Japanese-only; there's no English dub) is pretty good as well, especially for Shichika.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing left to mention is the GODLY final episode (one of the best finales in anime), but I'll not spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Katanagatari (it's really fun to type that name, by the way) is an amazing anime. I give it a 10/10, or a 93% for those of you who like percentages. I could talk more about this anime, but by that point you'll have been torn to pieces (subtle reference is subtle).\\n\\n\r\nCheerio!",

            "content": "Katanagatari is an epic tale of a quest to recover the 12 deviant blades of Shikizaki Kiki, the legendary swordsmith, whose blades had been scattered across Japan. The quest is given to Togame a minor official for the Owari Shoganate, who has given herself a very long and meaningless job title, who calls herself a strategian and is according to her a very good one if not the best. Part of her strategy in recovering the swords is to enlist the help of the 6th head of the Kyotoryuu (swordless) sword style, and the man responsible for putting down the rebellion against the Shoganate, onand isolated island.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that he is dead. Instead she finds Yasuri Shichika, the 7th head, who is a bit slow and naive living with his emotionally stunted older yet highly dangerous older sister, Nanami. After convincing him to help her and him proving his skill in obtaining the first sword they head off to find the other 11.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the quest they not only have to face the current owners of the swords who are less than willing to give them away but also enemies who have their own reasons to collect the swords which leads them all to their own destruction.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari took me a little while to get into. The animation style took me a while to get used and at 50 minutes for each episode challenged my retention span as each episode has a lot of dialogue especially in the first half of the series but these are personal gripes. I'm glad I stuck with it as the story has a number of twists and unexpected events, especially in the second half of the series, as the characters of Togame and Shichika develop leading to a surprising conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAt the centre of the series is Togame and Shichika who start of as chalk and cheese. Togame who a egoistic city girl who is not as clever or streetwise as she thinks she is and Shichika who is a country bumpkin and has no idea about the world giving him a charming innocence. As the series progresses we learn more about Togame and Shichika and watch their characters change. Togame becomes more modest and a little dependent on Shichika and Shichika becomes more knowledgeable about the world. As a result a deep bond and romance develops between them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the other characters some work and some don't. I'm not sure about the Maniwa Ninjas and I like some of the sword owners and some left me a bit cold. However, I really liked Nanami and the Princess Hitei especially with her catty arguments with Togame. Fortunately the weak characters don't stay in the series long and we see a lot of the good characters\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of the show is the witty and clever script especially the dialogue between Togame and Shichika with Shichika questioning whether Togame actually has a strategy and Togame's catchphrase of \"CHEERIO!!!\". Put this together with the twists you have a very enjoyable show. \\n\\n\r\nSo I'm going strongly recommend you watch Katanagatari and aim a encouraging punch in your direction shouting \"CHEERIO!!!\".",

            "content": "\"Things of excellence will not die\" - Japanese proverb.\r\nWhile some may argue it's far easier when you have a whole month to plan ahead, I'd say Katanagatari is the perfect example of what happens when you aim for quality and art, rather than dvd sales and ads.\r\n(Relatively) No one knows this anime, whereas everyone should do so.\r\nHow comes I didn't give Katanagatari a 10 then? The ending left me a bit blue. \r\nSomehow, the finale doesn't feel right to me. While there are some notable precedents to jaw-dropping finales, this was more shocking than surprising.\r\nYes, I'm that much selfish. However, works of entertainment shouldbe judged on how well they did provide leisure, right? So it's only normal that a less enjoyable ending influenced the score.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Katanagatari is extremely close to being a masterpiece, and might well be so once I get over the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing and even better at times, if anything it can serve a little too much fanservice: the fans of the genre will be elated, however.\\n\r\nThe narration has no fillers, an extreme intellectual honesty, and a really enticing narration.\\n\r\nMusic is in a class of its own: perfectly tailored to the setting, and actually pleasurable to listen to! I even have the first opening on my MP3 alongside Mozart.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: watch it if you're not doing so already!",

            "content": "Nisoisin is best known for the Monogatari franchise. A franchise that is truly dependent on large amounts of symbolism and witty dialogue to draw in viewers and keep attention to what is basically 24 minutes of talking. Katanagatari is just that. However instead of being 24 minutes, each episode is 45. This is what initially drives potential viewers away with a remarkably unique art style, even though it is written by the great Nisiosin himself. To people who think that way, I would say give it a chance, because you are truly missing out. *Note: This review contains spoilers.*\r\nOur story revolves around Shichika and Togame,and the adventures they share in the path of pursing Togame's goals. At the beginning when we meet Shichika we see why Togame wants to use him to further her goals: he's incredibly strong, and does so without the use of any weapons at all. It's very interesting to note that Shichika's actions in the beginning reflect what he's made out to be: a wielderless weapon. However upon meeting Togame the first human he's interacted with outside of his family, he quickly becomes interested and it's there that he has found his wielder. From there on Katanagatari begins to explore the themes of Humanity in an amazing way through Shichika and the incredible development his character goes through. One such example of this is early on in the series, Shichika is extremely quick to kill his enemies with no signs of emotions or remorse. It's as if he might as well be a sword himself. Just an extension of his wielder. The series does an excellent job in exploring and developing Shichika from being at first; just Togame's sword, into his own full fledged person by the end of the series. The story is incredible and I'd say my personal favorite work of  Nisiosin. However, what really drives people away is the episode length and how dialogue heavy the show is. To that I say: just read it all, because it is amazing. Like the Monogatari series the dialogue is chock full of symbolism and witty remarks. One such tribute to this is the troll we get in episode 4 with Sabi. I genuinely wasn't even angry when it happened even though it had taken 4 episodes to build him up like some sort of badass villain, it was actually very well executed. And last but not least, I thought I'd at least mention episode 11. When Togame is dying in Shichika's arms, it's one of the most surreal down to earth reveals in this anime. It's what made her a character rather than a trope. She was so hell bent on vengeance that she had no qualms about using Shichika even though she had fallen for him. What's great about this moment is not only is it just beautiful and tragic at the same time, we get to see Togame's \"scheming\" eye when she reveals this to Shichika, so it's really left up to viewer interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the art is great. It drives a lot of potential viewers away with how unique it is, but I think it really fits the show perfectly. It has sort of a children's book feel the way the character designs are made which fits again, perfectly as the whole show was basically the tale of the adventures of Togame and Shichika. This can be referenced to the \"-gatari\" in Katanagatari which literally translates to \"Sword Story\" which is a fitting title. The soundtrack was great. It always captured the mood perfectly. The one track that is the most memorable in my opinion was the theme that played when Togame would speak to Shichika about what she was planning; the track that included the oriental style music with rapping. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say this anime is truly a masterpiece. It was very deep, and explored it's themes over layers of well done symbolism. Katanagatari is overshadowed by Nisioisin's more popular works: obviously being the Monogatari franchise. It's a damn shame how relatively unknown Katanagatari is compared to the Monogatari franchise is, because in my opinion it's better overall than the Monogatari franchise. And I say this even though I am one of the biggest Monogatari fanboys out there. I'd say Katanagatari is a solid 10/10, one of the only anime I'd consider to be a masterpiece that has come out in this recent day and age.",

            "content": "***MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***\r\nKatanagatari translated into English reads \"Sword Story\" and true to it's title, the entire anime is centered around the story of Swords... both real and figurative. \r\nThe title in many ways can be misleading. Because the story isn't so much an action adventure as much as it is a coming of age story. The action in the show is limited, with only the final few episodes showcasing a good-ish amount of action. The quality of the action however, is quite good. The soundtrack -in particular Bahasa Palus- really sets the atmosphere for every occasion. \r\nWhere the series truly shines however is the dialoguebetween the characters. At times it can be rather tedious but at the heart of it all the dialogue has proper meaning and ties into the core concept of the story which is about the life and purpose of a sword. The exchanges range from childish, to witty to downright profound and it helped balance the lack of action quite well. \\n\\n\r\nI have one recommendation and one criticism. The recommendation is that if you're binge watching this series then PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THE OLD WOMAN'S EPILOGUE at end. The original show aired one episode per month, and therefore it was fine for the epilogue to give you a few spoilers for the next episode because chances are you wouldn't really remember them till the next episode. But if you're watching the episodes back to back then I strongly advise you to stop the episode as soon as you hear the epilogue begin. \\n\\n\r\nMy criticism would be that an epic battle -which is shown as part of a preview- doesn't actually happen in the show. Instead the episode is taken up in the development of a minor character into a major antagonist. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, I found it disappointing because the battle -if it would have been shown- could have quite easily been the best and the most epic battle you would see in Katanagatari. So be ready for some disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I enjoyed the show thoroughly and would definitely recommend it to people who enjoy a healthy dose of dialogue along with their action.",

            "content": "Katanagatari is an adaptation of the light novel series of the same name written by Nisio Isin. The show began airing on the 26th of January, 2010, and consisted of 12 episodes, each one aired in a month and corresponding to a volume of the light novel. This made for an abundance of content to be packed into each 50-minute episode and that abundance is where Katanagatari excels, be it in its dialogues or stylized art.\r\nFrom the first episode, the viewer almost immediately introduced to the excellent dialogue that makes up much of the series; from apparently trivial banter to the lengthy, rich conversations betweenthe main characters that clearly explain the different settings in the story. The dialogue spans different topics and improved with the unique personalities of the characters involved so it doesn\u2019t get boring. The series leans heavily towards exposition to cover for the huge amount of storytelling required for each episode which helps the viewer stay on track but it doesn\u2019t come without its downsides. There\u2019s even a (mostly) helpful narrator that starts out each episode with a recap and ends each episode with a brief summary. But an abundance of exposition isn\u2019t without its downsides.\\n\\n\r\nFor a series labeled with the \u2018Action\u2019 tag, there\u2019s too much conversation and not enough action; sometimes there\u2019s dialogue where an action scene would have told the story better. This, combined with the lengthy episodes (and the art which I\u2019ll get to later), makes the show a little difficult to get into at first. Another downside with the dialogue-heavy style is that the show loses a little of its mystery as almost everything is explained and the show becomes more predictable as a result. In fact, there\u2019s a point in the show where the viewer is best advised to not listen to the narrator. Barring these, the dialogue is often interesting, thanks to the wealth of characters the series offers.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in Katanagatari; from the main characters Shichika and Togame, through the side characters like the Maniwa Corps, to the sword wielders. The characters are mostly unique in their choice of outfits, speech patterns and personality; the similarities being in the visual style. One of the most notable parts of the character designs is their outfits as earlier mentioned; while the style takes root in traditional Japanese clothing, it\u2019s often flamboyant and sometimes impractical. A good example are the Maniwa Corps outfits that often contradict their nature as ninja. While the wealth of characters makes for an interesting show, an unavoidable consequence is the lack of development for most of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTogame and Shichika, being the lead characters, go through a lot of development as the show progresses, Shichika\u2019s being the more pronounced as he becomes more human. The same cannot be said for the supporting cast, especially the Maniwa Corps who are often disposed of as soon as they appear. The sword wielders don\u2019t escape this fate either; they\u2019re often limited to the episodes in which they are featured. It\u2019s difficult to feel sympathy for the supporting cast as the viewer isn\u2019t offered enough emotional attachment to them. Katanagatari is a huge story that isn\u2019t just about the characters but also about the world they live in, so the inadequate characterization could be excused. And nothing projects the vast world more than the visual style.\\n\\n\r\nKatanagatari\u2019s visual style stands out in several ways. The characters are drawn in a cartoonish style with plain facial features but often flamboyant outfits as mentioned earlier. The environment art is often less colourful than the characters but offers much more detail. And it is this that the viewers eyes are often drawn to during the often long conversations.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the uniqueness of the art style, it does look mediocre compared to other series made in the same season and year. The animation, while brilliant in some parts, is often of usual fare, and sometimes, sub-par. These are often enough to deter a potential viewer of the show but the patient eventually get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not as pervasive as the other three elements discussed, the sound and music in Katanagatari is brilliant and often acts as an adequate complement to the various scenes, including the sparse battle scenes. The background music is a blend of contemporary music, jazz and hip hop especially,  and traditional Japanese music; there\u2019s even a rap score that plays at some interesting moments. The voice acting is generally okay save for Shichika\u2019s: his bland voice takes a bit of time to get used to.\\n\\n\r\nFor its merits and flaws, Katanagatari is an original blend of episodic and serial storytelling that brings with it a wealth of characters and settings. It\u2019s an enjoyable adventure tale that\u2019s best savoured gently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n",

            "content": "An under-watched (near) masterpiece.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThis is the weak link. The overarching story here is the two main characters' journey across Japan in search of the 12 legendary swords, or the \"Deviant Blades\". The \"why\" is pretty vague throughout. Of course there are others looking to procure these swords, so that adds in a little more conflict here and there. Overall, though, the story is the reason Katanagatari is only a (near) masterpiece.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI'll admit, I was a little skeptical when I saw the plain-looking character models. But the thing is, it just works. The art style is not only unique, it is a thing ofbeauty. Pause at moment, any given frame, and just admire the artistry. The fights in particular as visually stunning. It's quite simply one of the best looking shows I've had the pleasure of watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOne of the top 5 OSTs from any anime I've seen. The impressive part, though, is the range. One minute it'll hit you with a beautiful traditional Japanese song, the next there'll be a smooth R&B song that'll have you bobbing your head with the beat. Regardless of the genre, the music somehow always seems to fit. And the voice acting is absolutely top-notch across the board. From Shichika's droll delivery, to Togame's cheerful \"Cheerio\", to Hitei's devious-sounding monologues, it was some of the best voice acting I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the two main characters, and they steal the show. Togame is clearly the brains of the operation, and Shichika is the brawn. While Shichika, having lived on an island with his father and sister all his, is completely clueless to the outside world, Togame is a pint-sized schemer and self-described \"strategian\". While Shichika oftentimes comes off as an emotional drone, Togame is delightfully cheerful. Needless to say, they are polar opposites in almost every way, and this creates some entertaining moments. As far as the others, Togame's arch-rival, and somewhat villainous, Princess Hitei, and Shichika's tiny over-powered sister are standouts. But don't be fooled, by the end you'll learn some of these characters are not exactly who you think they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis is one of the few series I can legitimately say I enjoyed from start to finish. I usually get a bit restless sitting through 50 minute episodes, but that was not the case here. It looks and sounds beautiful, the fights are great, Shichika's ancient swordless fighting style is a cool gimmick, and the two main characters are such a fun duo. It was a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe weak story is the only negative. It is perfection in every other area. This is a show that not nearly enough people have watched, as it is truly a (near) masterpiece.\\n",

The only thing I didn't like was the romance the main characters had i liked them as a couple, but remember you guys don't have to agree with me. They had a sexual/awkward relationship I liked the fact that they weren't so lovey dovey, but the awkwardness was a little much.  They had a comedy but I put wasn't my type of comedy but it may be for you. The characterswere pretty good though basically the only reason that I personally didn't like was the way they handled the romance but besides that it was a good anime",

Be warned however, the feels are real, but regardless you'll be happy you watched the show. overall 9/10 by my vote.",

With each episode running about 45-50 minutes they continued to keep my attention.  Togame hunts down the legendary Shichika on an island to use his services and gather these swords made by a legendary swordsmen.  I enjoy anime that have stories and plots that aren't your typical garbage that everyone throws out.  I truly felt that Katanagatari brought a new element to anime.  I almost didn't watch it because of the art, I thought it was almost childishly drawn, butfound myself starting to like and find beauty in it towards the end. I am glad I did, the story that unfolded, the action displayed, and the plot twists that unfold were well worth the watch.",

I love the thick line storybook style drawing, it was a nice change from the norm. (Hyakka Ryouran is also doing it now.) A few of the main characters have a lot of depth, but many of the secondary and even third level characters are lost as to their story or why they are there.  The music is good, much of the combat is really well done and fun to watch and the 45 min episodes are atreat.  I would recommend this to anyone to watch.\\n\\n\r\nPS:  SCREW YOU LAST EPISODE!

            "content": "-------------- \r\nCriteria \r\n--------------\r\nStory: 8.5\r\nThe story of Katanagatari is one that I have also never seen done before. It was so simple yet was simply able to hold me for 12 episodes straight. The story practically revolves around the number 12 and the main protagonist Yasuri Shichika. 12 Episodes, 12 deviant Swords, 12 Maniwana heads...you see where I\u2019m going. The story follows Yasuri Shichika and Togame on their quest to find these deviant Blades. Yasuri Shichika utilizes a martial arts (Kyotouryuu) only known to those of the Yasuri Bloodline.\r\nThe story was beautifully set out and really easy to follow, except for the fact that there areso many characters it\u2019s easy to forget the protagonists name\u2026 Yasuri Shichika. \\n\r\nKyotouryuu \\n\\n\r\nEnding: 9\\n\r\nOnly of the most epic endings I\u2019ve seen to any anime. The ending is both sad and awesome at the same time\u2026sad to see it end but awesome how they ended it. We finally get to the true power of Kyotouryuu, which is just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 8\\n\r\nThe plot is extremely solid and consistent; I don\u2019t believe they ever sway away from the main story line and if they do its only ever for character development. \\n\\n\r\nMoral: 8.5\\n\r\nThe moral of Katanagatari is something very simple bit not a lot people ask themselves it. \u201cWhat do you fight for?\u201d Find the answer to that and you find the answer for your reason to live. Or so I believe. \\n\\n\r\nSense: 8.5\\n\r\nEverything in Katanagatari is explained in a lot of detail, so all the Who\u2019s, What\u2019s, When\u2019s, Where\u2019s, Why\u2019s and How\u2019s are all ticked off. Sometimes you have to just stop and think about it for that light bulb to finally glow.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nWhen there\u2019s a suspenseful moment suspenseful music is played, when it\u2019s a sad moment sad music is played\u2026I think I was sadder because of the type of music instead of the moment.\\n\r\nThe Music is Katanagatari is really complimentary to the scene/moment.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art style is Katanagatari is something I\u2019ve never seen done before yet I found it quite to my liking. The art shifts at time going from classical art, to visual novel art and then back to normal art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nYasuri Shichika is now easily one of my favorite male protagonists. I\u2019ve simply never seen anything like him, I loved him\u2026only way to put it. By far the best male protagonist. The character art style was also flawless and no two characters looked the same. The character art style is bar far one of my favorites in any anime to date. Each character was modeled differently and you could tell how much effort they put into character detail. It\u2019s like their very appearance told a thousand word essay about them. From their hair, to their eyes, down to their build and very feet everything was unique.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom Factor: 4\\n\r\nAdmittedly sometimes I did fine myself being \u2018bored\u2019 due to how much talking they did before the fight . A lot of Katanagatari is talking and adventure about 60%-70% of each episode and then the small [portion at the end is the major climax\u2026the fight scene they\u2019ve been building up to. \\n\\n\r\nCaptivation Scale: 9\\n\r\nWhen the fight scenes did come I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it. Kyotouryuu a fighting style I\u2019ve never seen or heard of before is unraveled before us, and what an awesome fighting style it is. The ending of each episode was amazing and I don\u2019t think I could ever wait to watch the next (which is why I watched it on one day)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 9\\n\r\nKatanagatari = Awesomegatari nuff said. An awesome anime with awesome genres, a bit of love, action, martial arts\u2026.something for everyone \\n\r\nDo I recommend it\u2026Hell YES!!\\n\r\nIf you have not watched this yet you are missing out big time.\\n\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nAction: 7\\n\r\nThe action scenes where always at the end however when they came they were awesome yet also short\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 8 \\n\r\nThere are a lot of romance elements to Katanagatari which I just found sweet, the romance element to Katanagatari also helps to add a lot of character development, bonds and maturity between Yasuri and Togami. \\n\\n\r\nMartial Arts: 9\\n\r\nAwesome Martial Arts genre anime especially seeing as I\u2019ve never seen or heard of Kyotouryuu before, watching Kyotouryuu unravel was truly a sight to see.\\n\\n\r\nAdventure: 8.5\\n\r\nIf travelling all over Japan isn\u2019t enough of an adventure than I don\u2019t know what is. From oceans to deserts to snowcapped mountains they go everywhere!\\n\\n\r\nPowers: 8\\n\r\nCombining ninpou with martial art, guns and swords sooo many powers shown in Katanagatari it\u2019s too hard to count.\\n\\n\r\nSuper Powers: 9\\n\r\nSuper powers in Katanagatari never get old, the way they say them and how they execute them are just awesome and flawless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (Average) 8.35",

The characters were drawn with simplicity but in bright colors. Upon saying that, it's kind of disappointing how they don't use this in drawing battle scenes. (especially the contacts between the Kyotoryuu techniques and the swords)\r\nIt's your typical quest story. What's different is its presentation and how it tends to keep its viewers guessing on what will happen next, and what happened during the battle. It's actually very clever, although a visual presentation would've been stunning. \r\nOn characters, I amgreatly intrigued with Togame's intentions and Shichika's background. They kind of stopped dropping clues once in a while. With Togame's family history, her intentions and motives on doing this quest are highly questionable. On the other hand, as soon as Schichika dropped the information on his father's death, his morals and his past are greatly in question. I hope the remaining episodes will reveal, clarify or sum up what is up with those two. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the unnecessary scenes between the two main characters, this anime is both entertaining and visually satisfying. How they manage to obtain the swords is the big question per episode and with three swords remaining, everyone's eager to find out how this will end.",

To put it simply this is an emotional story about the fortunes of life and misfortunes of loss. That life is worth living to its fullest no matter the good or bad that occurs. \r\nBesides the amazing story you have a lot of great action scenes and beautifully created scenery to look at throughout your journey. The music and sounds are good but sometimes feel lacking in some of the more movingor high paced scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a great experience from beginning to end. As long as you don't mind some frequent scenes of talking or narration to better understand the beautifully created world and its characters, you will greatly enjoy this anime as well.",

            "content": "***This review contains extremely mild spoilers in the 'Story' section. Nothing major.***\r\nKatanagatari is an anime that I have had to watch a couple times in order to fully pull my thoughts together. The first time I watched it I was very interested in the relationship between Shichika and Togame but the ending left a very bad taste in my mouth. After recently finishing it for the third time however, I have a revitalized liking to the show because after carefully deducting the plot, I am at peace with the ending.\r\nStory: 8.8/10\r\nA basic run down of the plot is that Togame (a self-proclaimed strategist) travels tohire Shichika in order to help her collect the twelve deviant blades that were left behind in the previous war. Unlike typical anime that have a runtime of around twenty minutes per episode, Katanagatari runs about fifty minutes per episode. When it first started airing, it only provided one episode per month so this pacing really made it a unique experience that both worked well and hindered the plot and sequence of events. Just a fair warning if you do not like excessive dialogue and the typical \u201cI\u2019m going to name all my attacks and tell you exactly what is on my mind at all times\u201d speeches then steer far away from this anime. The very clever and witty dialogue between all the characters never gets boring or excessive in my opinion but to someone who is used to watching very cut up and short scenes, they might begin to lose focus. Everything about this anime feels like it\u2019s continuously flowing on and never stopping or backtracking. Also the way each episode feels like a self-contained story focusing on one sword per episode is an example of how the runtime helped the anime feel more enjoyable. With all that screen time however there are some issues that affected me personally. While most of the dialogue is enjoyable and relevant to the story, in the earlier episodes there is quite a lot of rambling that honestly I think was put in to fill up some time. Also the real eureka moment where everything falls into place and you receive all the pieces of the puzzle doesn\u2019t start formulating until around the ninth or so episode so while the earlier on episodes are entertaining on their own, I felt a little left out of the picture. These two negatives are the only reason I gave this anime less than a ten on the story section; it is a very well written story that\u2019s ending will pull on your heart strings and also feel very rewarding for sitting through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA first glance at the animation will make you think it looks \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cplain\u201d and you are completely right in a sense. The animation style is very simplistic but yet at the same time very unique and beautiful. The backgrounds, character models, and fight scenes are all very quality work. It is also apparent that as the show progresses, the animation quality does in tandem. It still retains its style and presence but we see better reflections, more color depth, and much more fluid fight scenes. Each character we run into looks very refined and unique. The anime tradition of including obscure camera angles of certain lady parts comes into play in the later episodes but it is by no means ecchi. Overall it starts out a very unique looking anime and by the last episode, it blossomed into a truly beautiful work of art. It\u2019s just too hard to score it higher when compared to other great looking anime (Fate/Zero, Nisemonogatari, Redline, ext).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that from a total music geek\u2019s perspective, Katanagatari COMPLETELY caught me off guard. While most people will watch this anime and not really notice the score backing the show, it was very apparent to me from the beginning that the music not only set the moods perfectly but also as standalone musical tracks sounded great. The anime offers a very diverse offering of music ranging from pop and synth heavy parts to some of the best orchestral arrangements I have heard in a show. The music in the last episode really impressed me to a point that during my previous watch I grabbed my guitar and starting playing while watching the show. Not only is the music well done but also the voice acting of the Japanese staff. Since this anime relies on long drawn out conversations as a means to introduce different plot devices, it is very key to have voice actors that can bring out their character\u2019s personalities and quirks. Each character in this anime was voiced very well and was distinctive from everyone else. I felt like this show really nailed all the acoustical elements needed for any form of film.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that introduces a lot of characters, I felt as if most of them were given ample amounts of time to have decent character development presented. There were essentially three \u201cfactions\u201d in this anime; Togame and Shichika, the Maniwa Corps (a faction of ninja that broke away from the government), and Princess Hitei and her servant Emonzaemon (there is also another character that acts on his/her own accord but I don't want to ruin the surprise). All three of these groups play major roles of who controls what swords and information. While some of their intentions are not shown until very late into the show, you could honestly side with any of them. There really wasn\u2019t a \u201cbad guy\u201d presented until the very late stages of the show. Each group had rational reasoning for their actions so you felt more inclined to their cause. Another thing that I really like about the characters in this anime was how the Maniwa Corps was represented by different animals. Each member was symbolized by a different animal and their techniques mostly resembled their animal counterpart. Overall each main character performed very well and had a lasting impression on me. There were however some characters (mostly the Maniwa Corps members that had almost no screen time and a couple of the sword owners) that really did nothing for me. They just had no awe inspiring personality and in some cases were left out almost completely. One BIG example was the swordsmen Hakuhei Sabi who took the sword made out of glass. His character was described in such a way that made him sound like the most badass sword fighting character in recent anime history and when the episode came that they would fight him, I was completely stoked...except that they didn\u2019t show it AT ALL. So that I don\u2019t want to spoil what really happened during that episode but as for the fight between Shichika and Hakuhei, they just skip over it entirely and in the final minutes of that particular episode they briefly go over the fight and just say how close and amazing it was. But they never show it; it really pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show has gotten to a point where when new anime watchers ask what they should dive into first, I usually recommend this one first. It is just such a unique watching experience that I have never felt before. While I wish the plot was more prominent in the beginning and that some of the characters were explored a little more, this anime did more than offer an interesting adventure; it crafted a unique tale that had the best sense of growth that I have seen in recent anime. The ending ties up a very interesting plot that honestly caught me off guard. This anime has all the action, fighting, and beautiful set pieces you would expect from a high quality studio that made other great anime such as Steins;Gate. White Fox did an amazing job and I hope one day you will take the time to watch these brilliant twelve one hour episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Katanagatari was a toss up for me. I really didn't know what I would be getting into when I started this anime. In the beginning I had to laugh at how the characters were so careless as far as how they interacted with each other; however, as I continued to watch this series I was impressed with how many surprises I was faced with. Now, not to be super narcissistic, but I consider myself to be a viewer who can pretty much guess what will happen next in a show. That being said, Katanagatarai had mutilple times were I was in pure amazement at whatI just experienced. The show playful colors in some of these characters just to rip that image apart with some impressive plot twists. Like all animes though, I won't deny there were points where I just wanted it to move on, specifically become of all the explaining they do to make sense of what you just saw. I will forgive that though, just because, if I'm being comepletly honest, the explainations were fairly interesting. I'm sure if someone else who was more invested in the show than I was would eat that up real quick since most of it, like I said before, is fairly intriguing. Granted, I have just finished the show today, so my opinions are drawn towards the, \"I love this show\" more than, \"Let's review this for what it's worth\". I will say though, all in all, Katanagartari is a treat. With one of the most impressive last episodes I have ever seen in an anime I am throughly impressed and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys anime.",

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nSetting aside the unique animation, the story is kind of the typical one. It\u2019s a fictional historical story about chanbara (sword fighting). The love story part is nicely done but the comedy part is quite far-fetched. It\u2019s a 12 episode long series but every episode is almost an hour long. And it\u2019s episodic. There are lots and lots of talking. And when I say \u201clots\u201d as in 80% of the series is all talking and that\u2019s even during action scenes. The action part is the most or rather the only interesting and exciting part of the story.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nMost of the characters areinteresting with their own uniqueness but not as interesting as how every character looks. Shichika is the typical all strength yet so dense protagonist. He\u2019s weirdness and lack of emotions is because of how he was brought up. That\u2019s why he also doesn\u2019t know how to express his feelings to Togame. He doesn\u2019t even feel anything when killing someone. In a way, he can be interesting because of that. At the beginning he can be so morbid at times and so emotionless but as the series progresses and with the help of Togame, he learns what it means to have a human soul. Togame is also the typical \u201ctsundere\u201d female character who always gets mad in order to hide her true feelings and embarrassment. Though she\u2019s weak physically, she\u2019s really strong when it comes to resolve and really smart. The protagonists can be considered a unique yet still sweet couple. Through-out the series they finally act like a normal couple like sleeping together, playing with each other\u2019s hair while talking, bickering with the most trivial things, and they are quite intimate with each other. As the series progresses both experience major character developments as they learn lots of things together. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe biggest difference or uniqueness of this series form the others is the amazing artworks. From animation to character designs to fight scenes; everything can be considered as amazing artworks. In every episode there are colors everywhere which is so fun to watch. Even the characters are so colorful from head to toe. It\u2019s like watching a beautiful moving painting. The character designs are not your typical ones. From the characters themselves to the outfits; it\u2019s all different in a nice way. It\u2019s really refreshing and fun to see all colors and designs on the outfits particularly the protagonists\u2019 outfits. It is so cool. And with all honesty, the different character designs are more interesting and to look forward than the character themselves. The fight scenes are really nicely done that can even compare with some of the mainstay action animes of today. Though, that being said it\u2019s only for a very short time as majority of the episodes are spent in talking. You could say that it\u2019s not really an action-packed series. But the ending episode is the most amazing and coolest fight scene in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe \u201call talking\u201d rather than something really happening is definitely making the series less interesting and exciting. It can be really boring when it\u2019s like that because before you know it, the episode is almost done with just all talking between characters. It has the best animation and most amazing artworks but that\u2019s that. It is interesting enough but it\u2019s lacking when it comes to certain excitement that would make you want to look forward the next episode. But still, I will admit that I want to save it to add to my collection but the ending is not really for me which is really a shame because I really want to save it because of the amazing artworks but unfortunately that\u2019s not enough.\\n",

            "content": "Katanagatari is hard describe without spoiling it; it is a series that works masterfully toward its end.\r\nBuilt on the back of light comedy and a habit of mocking conventions of epic tales of adventure, even the most simple of phrases and the smallest of events carve out important meanings within its structure. Though truly not witnessed until its conclusion we see these as limitations created by the characters themselves at the very beginning of the series; the small details we pass over as viewers continue to unlock the potential of the series as it unravels.\r\nWhile trying not to spoil anything, the ending must be discussed,at least vaguely.  For a series that built itself of comedy and going against conventions, it concluded in a bizarre torrent of darkness, brutality, and violence that sought only to convey the most comforting of nihilism. You will be shocked and you will be surprised, but you will also be grasped firmly by its conclusion and, after everything has settled, feel entirely at ease.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend not watching it all in one go. The month-to-month pace felt very correct, as each episode corresponds approximately to the passage of one month's time within the series; perhaps watch an episode per week. As only a true masterpiece could, even the rate at which the series is watched has an importance, and is meant to have an effect on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nA perfect 10 out of 10.",

This I suppose would be the shows main selling point, if you hate shows like naruto, you MIGHT end up really liking this one, if not then perhaps ninja's just aren'tyour thing. I can also say that if you like Gurren Lagann, you will probably like Katanagatari, as I will describe the last episode in only one word: Epic.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are turned off of this show from the stylized artwork, but that's probably the lamest reason to not watch a show, plus the art quality in katanagatari is top notch. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is wordy, so if you can't read you shouldn't watch it.",

The fact that the episodes are longer I think allows you get more of a plot from the series and to get a better story line.

            "content": "The art in _Katanagatari_ is nice, of course, and the Nisoisin verbal flourishes are appreciated as always, but the story currently is less than inspiring (a fetch-quest for swords?) and in parts peculiar - the two protagonists have fallen in love already?! What is going on here? Is Nisoisin just trying to troll us?\r\nThis speculation recurred to me with the hilarious episode 04: they'd been building up to the fight with the master swordsman Hakuhei since episode 1, and the episode 3 preview showed them fighting Hakuhei with shattering mountains in mid-air jumping from rock to rock, etc., and then episode 4 is about... thelittle sister killing a ninja squad with her instant-learning/cloning ability. The episode concludes with the protagonists gorging on food, with the smoking island in the distance, spending several minutes talking about how incredible awesome the duel was and how amazing Hakuhei was and how each new secret technique astounded them. I couldn't decide whether it's an epic troll or a clever way to save money, but in retrospect with the whole series to look back on, it's clearly part and parcel of how _Katanagatari_ is constantly messing with the viewer and their expectations. This was an interesting thing to do, but I do expect more from my anime than tired post-modern gags and so, as of episode 05, I was still not terribly impressed. (eg. I was expecting a longer callback for the 'cheerio' joke, and the fight was boring. But at least an episode passed without some Maniwani dying - it was starting to feel like they were the officially designed butt-monkeys.) Immediately, a new example presented itself: Did the closing narration for episode 6 really just spoiler the entire point of episode 7? It did! It happened exactly like the narration said! What kind of anime gives away the climax of the next episode like that\u203d (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b And with 08, we got back to killing off Maniwani casually... The rapier was done better in _Shigurui_, IMO. Similarly, episode 09 is not very good; the romantic humor is seriously weak, and while I always approve of guns subverting the usual martial arts tropes, I'm annoyed to see *another* gimped Maniwani death. (That said, I did enjoy the quasi-Evangelion episode 10.)\\n\\n\r\nPushed through and finished _Katanagatari_. The art is consistently excellent where it's not amusing ('The flippant way the series treats its carnage often makes it more, not less disturbing\u2014the creepily cute video game version of Nanami's bloodiest rampage being a prime example. ') and the action part of the ending was as good as I had hoped, but what a mixed package! I *understand* the whole prophecy &amp; stealing technology &amp; altering history stuff, I just think it sucks and comes off as tacked-on, and the killing of Togame...! I read the ANN review of the second half sans spoilers, and it mentioned that there was a big event in the second half that would disgust and nonplus viewers instead of being an emotionally devastating twist like intended, and I thought to myself, 'well, the only thing I can think of would be finally killing off Togame as they've been threatening the entire time' and... yes. I have other issues - a weird mock climax for Houou, Penguin's powers being nothing like we were led to believe, the waste of an episode on the bokken, the bizarre epilogue with Princess Denial tagging along with mapmaker Shichika.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, _Katanagatari_ is pure style, style which almost becomes real substance.",

            "content": "This is not your usual anime, it is so much more.To anyone who normally watches the typical shounen anime (Naruto, Bleach, Inuyasha) like me, I would recommend this anime as a nice change. You will not be disappointed.\r\nAt first the story begins simply with the search for 12 swords but there is a much deeper plot involved. The character development, different situations and personalities that they encounter along the way tie in to present a great story.\r\nEach episode is roughly an hour long so you can consider the 12 episodes to be more like 24. There is a lot of dialogue involved but it's mixedwith a fair share of action and comedy. You will come to fall for the two main characters Shichika and Togame as well as the odd sword wielders that they face. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is stunning and adds greatly to the appeal of the anime and was one of the main reason why I decided to watch this anime. To me if so much effort is placed into drawing and animation, then it should not disappoint and it did not.",
