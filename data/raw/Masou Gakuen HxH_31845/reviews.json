            "content": "Category: Ecchi\r\nRank: Tier 1\r\nPremise: \"Suspension Bridge Effect\" It's the rapid heartbeat and arousal when in state of danger. Named after it's discovery of friends and/or people of the opposite sex tended to get married right after experiencing a tall bridge crossing. When in danger your biological alarm kicks in as a form of a reality check, All living beings are meant to procreate. The phenomenon released chemicals inducing individuals to fall in love and a need to have intercourse after a hyper sense of arousal on a very aware state.\r\nOn Masou Gakuen HxH Episode 01. Hida, Kizuna and Chidorigafuchi are under attack by an alienmecha force; the heroine in question on a almost near death situation with an already state of danger both Kizuna and Chidori blush and simultaneously suffered from rapid and increasing heartbeats. All this while Kizuna touches Aine on a erotic manner arousing her and driving her to climax. After the \"Heart x Hybrid\" takes place the heroine is seen pressing her hand against her chest when Kizuna was talking to both Himekawa Hayuru and Yurishia Farandole on a flirty manner or at least is seen in such manner by Chidorigafuchi Aines eyes. \\n\\n\r\n The name of the phenomenon \"Heart x Hybrid\" which is later explained by the commander of \"Amaterasu\" Hida Reiri, Amaterasu being the name of the Japanese force against other world invaders, Reiri says that \"HxH\" is not be outright lewd and/or actions but a state of synchronization between Body and Soul.The Heart Hybrid Phenomenon is later expanded upon on Episode 02 when Yurishia Farandole achieves this when Kizuna merely places his hand over her left breast, reinforcing that a psychological x danger requirements are a necessity rather then outright lewdness for power up as many can easily misunderstand. This means endorphin s are creating the love state whilst the human body becomes aroused with lust. This directly results on the power up of the \"Heart x Hybrid Armor\" and / or \"Magitech Armor\" as it is referenced later on the show. A weapon which is the only weapon for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nTwist: Although \"Heart x Hybrid\" grants enhanced abilities powered by the synchronization of Love and Lust. It uses spiritual energy as well as fuel, The state and power of \"Magitech Armor\" it's directly correlated to \"HxH Points\" who directly affects power output of the armor and ability to protect it's user.\\n\\n\r\nIf the Heart x Hybrid points were to reach Zero it would result in immediate death for whomever uses the armor. A fact that only the commander and/or sister or Kizuna \"Hida Reiri\" and Kizuna our MC knows. this becomes his coping mechanism as he seems to operate under the thought that lewd things and/or Heart Hybrid + Climax Hybrid are nothing more than maintenance and he does it with the outlook of protecting his comrades lives. he becomes vigilant making sure none of his team members Heart Hybrid Points reach the Danger zone which is 15% or Below. \\n\\n\r\nHeart Hybrid participants experience the power up because they all have gone through body modification, They've injected invading alien Mecha core that seems to respond to a combination of Love and Lust. Normal women don't get a power up because they can't since they haven't been modified themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi Builder: Kizuna must come up with unique ideas to accelerate healing on Heart Hybrid participants by doing lewd actions. This lewd factor absorbs the rest of the genres on a satisfactory way on which the lewdness facilitate battle engaging, Character development towards one another as well as opening up about their individual experience as human experiments growing up in order to fight other world invasion and halt humanity progress towards extinction. \\n\\n\r\nPlot Overview: 15yrs + ago humanity was attacked by another world and was humiliated into submission. Even though the enemies left most of humanity was killed and weren't seen again until 6 months prior to the present of this story. Humanity has been kicked out of their respective countries and have no other choice but to live on \"mega floats\". Artificial countries floating about on the ocean. most nations and their inhabitants have been killed off and those whom wander the ocean goal is to take back their respective countries.\\n\\n\r\nThe surviving countries all have specialized teams that can fend off the other world advanced technology. a team of people wearing the \"Magitech Armor\" and/or \"Heart x Hybrid Gear\". aside from the goal of taking back their respective lands, teams of each respective nations such as \"USA, Japan, Russia, China etc\" must seal inter-dimensional gates that serve as portal from this world to the next as well as to reclaim their land under enemy control. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Throughout the years we've seen experimentation of the anime industry to use 3D animation to reduce cost, Keep animated consistency, Facilitate mass producing of more anime and possibly keep more money for better pay while trying to keep the \"Japanese animation history\" of authenticity. They're tried from fully 3D all the way varying 2D textures on 3D models. Some kinda succeed and some end up like \"Berserk\". Most anime studios have reached the conclusion to keep 2D characters while just 3D environments. One of the first projects to do this was the anime \"Tokyo Ravens\" or earlier one like \"To Love-Ru\" season one when displaying alien creatures and some inventions but as someone who has seen \"Kizumonogatari\" movie, Shaft has mastered it.\\n\\n\r\nOn Masou Gakuen HxH there are 3D modeling but somehow Studio IMS has given a whole new breed on a 2D Fusion with 3D. The result are noticeable on the characters as they seem multi dimensional without feeling boxy like standard 3D. The art feel more fluid and more solid as per substance on the artwork. The enemies keep a higher amount of 3D but it isn't a issue since the main point of the series lies on Erotism. With that I think it was a good call.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't perfect all the time since Production IMS had their hands full the entire season handling  \"Active Raid\" simultaneously. however the episodes that did managed to get through the animation it is superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It puts hentai voice acting to shame, The voice actors /actress do a very good job at the erotic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ecchi / Harem are pretty standard, It's flooded with Tsunderes and some Kuderes. Minus the Yanderes. The writer Kuji has been paying attention to successful ecchi on the industry and has grabbed the best from past / current ecchis.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa Hayuru: it's a nitpick out of To Love Ru, Since her personality is 88% Kotegawa Yui \"The One Yelling Shameless All the time\" but twisted on a more assertive fashion and a little less tsundere. Her personality it's well thought out though as it becomes evident why \"Shameless\" things bother her and ultimately what bothers her is slacking off.\\n\\n\r\nShe is very much obsessed with morality and being proper. Himekawa also harbors the need to be competent due to her once arrogant demeanor got many Japanese citizens killed while she was on escort duty to transfer them to the Japanese mega float.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently her sense of duty is near an obsession that she is trying to get over with. she is fully aware that Ataraxia is a military school of sorts and to her relationships equals lewd things which ultimately means slacking off. her pursuit to keep people or rather students in check from doing anything it's a damage control of hers trying to keep her fellow class mates from having to experience what she saw when escorting Japanese citizens to the mega float.\\n\\n\\n\r\nChidorigafuchi Aine: An orphan who lost everything and doesn't know how much she lost. She is cold on the outside and always seems to portray a seemingly god complex to sustain her ego and maintain her constitution afloat of being the best so that she may be useful to the cause.\\n\\n\r\nHer personality is explained through her dark past and how she developed that personality. As an amnesiac orphan who sees her worth strictly correlated to her fighting capabilities. She will do anything to obtain power to maintain her world view of being worth something for capabilities only, instead of her persona. She would offer up her body if need be.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give you a blend of characters to accurately tell you about her, I would say she has a 46% Senjougahara Hitagi on regards to attitude and self worth. This also is shown on her aesthetic relationship with the MC Kizuna Hida. Then I could add a 34% Xenovia Quarta on regards to thirst of fighting and desire for power and improvement as well as some aspects to sexual matters. The remainder 20% it's up to you guys, Though personally I think is Asia Argento. Which isn't all there is since later on she becomes a different persona upon reaching a mutated state that her silver hair becomes PINK that just gives off and astounding air of confidence.\\n\\n\r\nYurishia Farandole: This character can only give you one flashback, That is the black haired beauty Akeno from High School DxD. The is a sadist and a tease all the same but on a much open form for interaction. she comes from a wealthy family of America.\\n\\n\r\nAn American on the Japanese \"Amaterasu\" team, former leader of the american \"Masters\" team. though she posses traits of a sadist she mostly gives off an older sister if not motherly vibe. she has the trait of being very protective of those she cares about and/or those on her team as made evident on episode 2 and sent Kizuna away trying to beat the danger herself and confirmed later on when her conflict with the current head of the \"Masters\" Scarlet Fairchild was revealed. Yurishia will not hesitate to lie to her peer to get them out of harms way. even if it means getting herself in deeper danger while trying to resolve what she deems great threats herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe often stresses herself being protective and like many on a position of being a care giver she deeply wishes that someone would take care of her as well. this is what opens up and new section and allows for her to become the \"receiver\" or \"masochist\" since she is into BDSM and / or S&M. as she can get into either role but harbors desire to be the one receiving the punishment since it allows her to escape all the burdens she places on herself.\\n\\n\r\nHida Kizuna : He is the troyan horse of this kind of anime and this anime in particular. At a glance it would deceive you to think he is yet another generic main character who is as dense as condensed milk and as thick as an oak tree.\\n\\n\r\n[Note: I can guarantee that if his design were different and he posses another hair color many would go gaga over him.]\\n\\n\r\nAs they say, Looks can be deceiving and this is the case for Hida Kizuna. Masamune Kuji really gave this a thought and gave us an MC with abandonment issues. As a child he was deliberately orphaned by his mother once he proved useless to her on regards to human experimentation and saw her son would prove little as a utility and wasted no time in discarding him as a ragged cloth. since he would no longer present any form of advancement for her experiments and weapon development.\\n\\n\r\nThis aspect would prove useful so that he would always seek improvement and a sense of duty to protect his peers. As prude as he is, he disregards it under the shadow of being discarded once again and he feels bound to be useful and often will be angry when told to do nothing. This quality unifies our MC with our heroines who at first went after him lusting for power. this bond with different forms of troublesome pasts that would come crucial on Heart x Hybrids which are literally Love and Lust. All born from self preservation and desire to survive. creating and ever evolving bond between our cast and deepening trust among themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate the \"power\" he was lusted after or depending on the countries respective team is lusted after currently. it is because \"Heart x Hybrid Points\" takes up weeks in going back to normal and time isn't a thing anyone of this world can spare. \\n\\n\r\nEros his \"Magitech Armor\" is capable to refill anyone armor restoring in one go their fighting capabilities and capacity being god sent to the teams that wish to triumph and survive. Eros is also capable of mutating any magitech armor increasing power output and granting higher tier weaponry. the weaponry in question can be absorbed by eros granting him any variable weapon he \"Climax Hybrid\" with which would be the mutated state of the magitech armor after surpassing the limiters of recovering regarding \"Heart x Hybrid Points\". many disregarding what lewd actions and sentimental proximity needed for it to happen. However understandable why Chidorigafuchi Aine and/or other women from other \"Heart x Hybrid\" teams want to meet Kizuna and/or stay on his good graces. Kizuna represents an unprecedented advantage for humanity and certainly a trump card that can make any team who has him more resilient in battle and power in comparison to those who wait maybe even months to get back to normal once their \"Heart x Hybrid Points\" are spent. \\n\\n\r\nHida Reiri is his moral compass and support so that his inner demons don't take over and to remain relevant and useful as his sister fulfilled his mothers role. fulfilled a role that was abandoned after he was discarded by his mother shortly after vanishing altogether.\\n\\n\r\n\"A persons value isn't decided by their abilities but on how they live\" -Hida Kizuna\\n\\n\r\nA quote that Kizuna always says to himself and that he has found useful to say to many other people to comfort them as his sister has comforted him and gave him hope and his feeling of being useless and ultimately possibly discarded once he becomes useless once again.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give this character a blend to give you an analogy of who he is or where he stands. I would say he has a 26% Yuki Rito on a degree of pureness and prudeness, Followed by a 54% Basara (Shinmai Maou no Testament) on a sense of duty and desire to protect people or at least help out. The rest is unknown but the direction he is taking is that of Akatsuki Ousawa (Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero). He grows more confident as time transpires and less disturbed by lewdness as time goes on. Needless to say he can get the job done where many MC would have frozen in time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.60: Masou Gakuen HxH creates atmosphere for a good lewdness factor absorbing and not getting on the way of the other genres native to the Tier 2 Ecchi. Such as Date A Live, Infinite Stratos, Hundred, Rakudai Kishi no Calvary and Gakusen Toshi no Asterisk. The characters on Masou Gakuen HxH are designed to chemically open to one another and when it comes to designs. Kuji made the right decision getting the legendary \"Hisasi\" the Doujin artist do his/her characters.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH though giving the feeling of cramped, It's well set up since the very beginning. all characters are well knit into each other and each episode can reinforce past episode and/or set up the next on a satisfactory way.",

            "content": "Stiff and inconsistent animation with 90's quality computer graphics; monotonous, boob-obsessed fanservice; vapid characters who yell and clinch their fists a lot to create the illusion of emotion where there is none.\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH is an uninspired clone of better anime that was produced with an appropriately low budget. It takes the premise from Infinite Stratos about the one guy with an ability to help attractive female fighters, and mashes it with the master-slave relationships from Shinmai Maou no Testament using a big tit-shaped sledgehammer. HxH lacks the fun of the former, and the sex appeal of the latter.\r\nOn the positive side, Kizuna, the mainmale character, wasn't an obnoxious gynophobe or raging pervert typical of harem anime. He was usually composed and diligent, and had no qualms with engaging in lewd sexual acts. On the negative side, he didn't have any memorable personality traits to elicit empathy from the audience. In nearly every scene he only provided one of three things: exposition, generic words of encouragement, or listless pseudo-sex with a girl from his harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters weren't any better, who, in their bulky \"hybrid gear\" attire, looked like balloon animals in shitty cosplay. They were nothing more than eye candy. No depth. No agency. Just walking body parts to be gazed upon, groped, and even humiliated.\\n\\n\r\nHxH would have been more enjoyable with deeper character personalities, smarter designs, and better sex. It usually takes more than a breast and ass massage to get a girl off. They somewhat figured this out at the last episode, but by then it was too little too late.",

            "content": "I'm sure a lot of people wrote this show off without even trying it simply because of the synopsis, the cover and the genre tags, and while I can't really blame them for doing so, I'll be the first one to admit that Masou Gakuen actually had potential. It really did. It had potential because it had a premise which promotes a lot of actual sexual interaction between its characters rather than merely relying on suggestive camera angles and such. Other than the general lack of originality, my main gripe with most battle harems is that they try to have some sort of serious storywhilst simultaneously having a lot of ecchi aspects, but ultimately they end up not really succeeding on either front. Masou Gakuen however had a real chance of at least succeeding with its sexual elements, which could very well have been enough to make it an above-average ecchi anime. But unfortunately it never manages to live up to that potential, largely thanks to an abundance of severe execution errors.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise itself is about as generic and uninteresting as it gets: some alien invaders more or less conquered Earth and humanity is on its last ropes. The story then takes place at a remote high school where the students are trained to fight the extraterrestrial invaders. Sounds reasonable enough, except that humanity's last hope now rests on a group of teenagers in needlessly skimpy mecha suits powered by eroticism. Because you know, that sounds like a very reliable solution when the actual worldwide military's missiles, lasers and artillery shells evidentially weren't enough to stop them.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we have our protagonist Hida Kizuna being sent to this school one day by his sister, with the purpose of literally fondling all the girls in it. Basically, the mecha suits in this show, called \"Heart Hybrid Gears\", can be artificially powered up by sexually stimulating its wielder, enabling them to actually stand a chance at victory against the alien threat. And that's more or less what the anime is about: the MC consistently ends up in erotic situations with various girls and makes them orgasm in order for them to be able to help protect mankind. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow I just want to make something very clear here: ending up with consistent sexual interactions is by no means a bad thing on paper. It's been proven many times in the past. The problem primarily lies with the underlying reason for why those scenes actually happen to begin with. Let's be real here, almost no one actually cares about the generic story when watching an anime like this. We're in it for the tits and ass and nothing more. So I have to ask, why do you need to go to these ridiculous lengths just to set up a scenario where sexual encounters can happen on a consistent basis? There's no reason it should have to be this complicated. Just look at something like Kiss x Sis for example: almost the entire anime revolves around two sisters lusting for their stepbrother and ending up in borderline hentai situations with him all the time. Why? Because they love him. That's literally all there is to it. We didn't need some alien invasion or mumbo jumbo ero-power or anything like that; all it took was affection, and it worked out great. But in Masou Gakuen we end up with a scenario where literally everything except for the ecchi scenes is absolutely terrible, and as a result it ends up severely dragging down the enjoyment of said ecchi scenes as well since they become so far-fetched and forced in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge make-or-break factor for ecchi/harems is of course the heroine cast, and this anime is is also a big disappointment on that front. They're all extremely shallow and stereotypical, and pretty much solely exist for the sake of being someone for the MC to get his hands on. They're the kind of girls whose entire characterization can be summarized by their breasts, and speaking of which, more than half of them also have these horrible physics-defying watermelon boobs which I'm getting seriously fed up with by now.\\n\\n\r\nOne comment you end up seeing fairly often from ecchi haters is that \"ecchi anime is useless since you could just watch hentai instead\", and while I don't agree with this logic since there are multiple other reasons to watch ecchi anime beyond just to get off to them, in Masou Gakuen's case I'm almost inclined to say it'd probably be true. Because seriously the ecchi scenes in this anime are not seductive, creative, fetishy or anything like that; they're basically censored porn. Like they're not actually having sex but we pretty much get finger banging, cunnilingus and more, and the girls are evidentially orgasming as a result of it. I mean it's literally the kind of explicit stuff that belongs in hentai, merely that we don't get to see genitalia directly. On top of that the girls are treated like nothing more than sexual objects rather than respectable characters, which is also something you'd expect to find in hentai instead. They're like walking manikins whose sole reason for existing is to be molested. Honestly I find it genuinely disrespectful, and I bet feminists would have a field day with it if they gave this anime a shot. So whenever I was watching one of the \"bonding\" scenes of Masou Gakuen, I just couldn't help but feel like there really wasn't much point to it given the available options.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of those scenes though, the anime also has some more generic and lame ecchi content such as the aforementioned skimpy mecha outfits they're all wearing. I've always wondered whether anime creators expect their viewers to be masturbating or being hyped when they put these half-naked anime girls into life-or-death battles so often... you can't both have the cake and eat it after all. Also sometimes it feels like the anime is seriously trying to enforce ecchi content when it really shouldn't, for example there's this one scene where the bad guys have captured one of the girls and are supposedly going to torture her for information, so what do they do? Of course, they decide to strip her and try to make her climax in the hopes that that'll make her talk. Not only does this make no sense from a logical standpoint, but also do you really expect me to be turned on from some cringeworthy and irrational torture scene? Like seriously?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I just can't understand what the actual intention is behind anime like this. If they're trying to turn people on, why does the mecha fighting and cringeworthy plot elements even exist? And if they're trying to create an exciting post-apocalyptic action show, there's obviously no need for all this facepalm-worthy \"ero power\" crap. If you wanted to come up with an ecchi anime where the MC has a legitimate excuse for doing sexual things to girls on a consistent basis, you could just do something like a show with a normal guy in a normal high school who one day gets cursed so that if he doesn't do something erotic with girls on a frequent basis then something bad will happen to him, or something like that. I'm not saying that would be an amazing anime, but on paper it already sounds a lot better than what Masou Gakuen is doing, and that took me like 5 seconds to think up. The bottom line is: if you want to do a show revolving around sexual encounters, just keep things simple. Just do enough in order to make the scenes not feel forced and leave it at that. Proper execution of the ecchi scenes is literally all most of the viewers actually care about after all. Doing things the other way around is just na\u00efve and ignorant.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything good about Masou Gakuen in the end? Well the OP and ED were both pretty decent so that's something at least, but that's hardly enough to carry it. I guess if you're a diehard fan of all things ecchi and don't care about execution quality at all then you might want to give this a shot, but otherwise I really wouldn't recommend it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh and as the cherry on top we get an inconclusive cliffhanger ending followed by \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d. Could it possibly get any better?",

            "content": "Masou Gakuen HxH is a light novel adaptation about a bunch of scantily clad mecha-using female warriors fighting a bunch of other scantily clad mecha-using female warriors from another dimension...yes this is a light novel adaptation, why do you ask? Oh you thought it was a hentai game adaptation? Pft, when was the last time those things showed up? Anyways, continuing on from that self-inflicted interruption, the show is about these female warriors fighting each other for a reason that isn't really elaborated on because why should plot matter in an anime about underage girls fighting with their tits hanging out, with the good guyside having that one lone male who makes you question which side you're supposed to be rooting for because he's a dick and every being with an extra X chromosome falls for him anyways no matter what side they're on? Oh yeah, and these mecha suits are powered by sexual lust for some reason, thus this one guy must charge up these females' fighting energy by giving them orgasms. And whilst females in hentai can get orgasms very easily, I think the producers of this show had some sort of internal bet in regards to how little a man has to do before getting his woman wet. Because the only sex moves that show up in this thing are boob groping and what I can only assume are cowgirl positions that came out of a book called \"How To Pretend To Have Sex For Dummies\", and yet these girls react to them like they're in a Takaoka Motofumi doujin.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen one shitty harem light novel adaptation, you've seen them all, and putting in \"animated sex\" that'd embarrass a shitty flash adaptation adds pretty much nothing to the formula other than more shame, and it's not even enough shame to be noteworthy. There's a bit of paraphrasing going on in the previous paragraph, but otherwise that's pretty much the entire show. Guy gets stuck in an all-girl section of what passes for military in anime world and proceeds to toy with their emotions whilst dealing with a paint-by-the-numbers plot that even a machine by Professor Frink from The Simpsons would have been embarassed to churn out. And I didn't make that Takaoka Motofumi reference lightly. If you've never read any of his doujins, they generally consist of asshole males with bad haircuts raping females that are either big busted housewives pretending to be high schoolers or twelve-year old lolis with nipples so perky you could cut glass with them all in the name of \"love\". As such, no one is spared. Except for the sister I guess, but after seeing who gets laid in this show, you'd wish the main dude had gone the incest route instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I stuck with this show was because it seemed like it'd be a bit raunchier than the average LN series. I mean its very first scene depicted a girl taking it up the butt, which caused me to think that maybe this trash was at least going to be a little tongue-in-cheek regarding the light novel craze the way people thought that godawful Who Is Imouto anime was going to play out before it actually started taking itself seriously and turned the kinda funny stalker angle into the shittiest mystery on the planet. Even if the end result was destined to be shit, maybe it won't be that mediocre/middle-of-the-ground shit I hate so much because there's nothing to say other than it's boring. No such luck I'm afraid, because after the first episode, the show reveals that the main females are whiny tsunderes who don't know what the fuck they want whilst the main dude...um, actually he doesn't have any problems with feeling up his childhood friend and their little sister, so maybe I got a little more of my wish than I thought.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the repetitiveness of the sex moves, very little actual nudity is really shown until late in the game, and that's assuming you're watching the AT-X version rather than the laughably censored Crunchyroll version. And it always tries to be coy about it even when it does show up to the point that calling out someone else's name during intercourse would be less of a turn-off. I know it sells and all, but I think Production IMS missed a few memos when they decided to become a fanservice studio, because there are a few things you have to keep in mind with porn assuming you're a teenage boy or lesbian who wants to please their frustrated libido without having to pay for it like a loser. One, most porn is absolute shit. I remember when I was introduced to my first porn site and trying to find something that was actually arousing was like trying to find a hot woman in a nude beach that's not in Central America. Two, most successful porn are executed with characters that have confidence, and the only confidence you can expect out of light novel stereotypes are the wishy-washy kind that get mad at their men for interacting with women who have every right to do so on account of them not being \"girls\". Three, your anime is on broadcast TV. Even with the horrible censors, you can't actually show stuff with real balls, let alone real balls. Four, just because you're making smut doesn't mean it has to be low-budget. Get some goddamn money rolling into your products, dudes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets particularly shitty in the final few episodes where the loli joins the fray for absolutely no reason whatsoever other than because the show felt like it wasn't pedo enough and decided it might as well go the extra mile. I have a few companions online who like watching this sort of perverted trash, and they all agreed that the show went too far when she got involved. Better not introduce them to the doujin series, Rapiere. They'd probably set themselves on fire if they saw just how low a female version of The Three Musketeers could sink. See, for a show that sells itself on using sex as a weapon, I was expecting something on the level of Sausage Party or Dororon Meera Mera Enma-kun where the big evil is defeated by a giant orgy and the main dude's sexual prowess is so powerful that he ends up getting every female in the world to leak sweat just by his mere aura, including the big evil. But no, the show ends with a bunch of poorly done action scenes followed by the main dude holding hands with the white-haired girl, who I think is supposed to be the main female lead, but the show doesn't do a good job of convincing me on that front for reasons I'm not going to get into because you don't care. Talk about a show that climaxed too early, huh?\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH wanted to prove to the world that it had a big dick, so it took a bunch of forbidden substances to give off the illusion that it could stand alongside the \"manly\" anime, only to end up getting too overexcited to the point that it blew its load early and ended up pretty pointless the rest of the way through. Its animation was flaccid, its characters limp, its comedy plain sucked, and what passes for sex and a plot just hurts to think about. Can't really see much of anything to recommend about the show. Even a heavily censored hentai on Youtube would be more exciting to watch, if only because there's a certain absurd humor to be found in how only ten percent of the screen is actually visible whilst the other ninety percent is so blurry you'd have better visibility watching the real thing underwater.",

            "content": "Porn with a Plot, yeah went straight into it huh...no but seriously.\r\nLA will be straight with you, LA had obvious reasons to try and NOT watch this anime for Summer 2016, however Masou Gakuen HxH still surprised LA for even ecchi standards...it was still awkward, hell yes, but still for the people thinking this anime is nothing but a borderline hentai...well yeah...but even a hentai has something of a plot....\"something\" being the emphasis.\r\nLike just from reading the premise, this anime is like Infinite Stratos but ramp up the fanservice levels to GODLY, then just add in the borderline hentai sex scenes and you have MasouGakuen HxH, but Masou Gakuen HxH has even a sliver of a plot LA can get interested (omitting the sex scenes anyways). What's the sliver of plot LA was soo interested in?.\\n\\n\r\nIt was the entire mystery to Aine Chidorigafuchi voiced by Akari Kageyama, as to who she is and why the mystery connection to the Magitech and the more dangerous Commanders of the Magitech, why are the invading Magitech forces want, the significance of Hida Kizuna the main protagonist and his \"only one man's special powers\" along with his mother issues, all these questions link Aine and Hida together. LA did say a silver you know, however that \"silver\" of a plot is what makes this anime move forward and it becomes intriguing as long as you see behind all the borderline-hentai.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice...well considering that this anime got out uncensored was quite baffling but all the more, LA did say that the fanservice was in GODLY levels, everything from uncensored boobs to foreplay and even threesomes and BDSM...don't ask why LA knows these. *cough* either way, Masou Gakuen HxH's focus on it's borderline hentai scenes as it encompasses a rather minority of the anime where even though it has \"hentai scenes\" once every episode, the main focus rather goes to developing the main cast of the Heart Hybrid Gear users and Hida Kizuna voiced by Kenji Akabane. But seriously you SHOULD know what your going into when watching this anime...it's on the PREMISE people.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, you'd think most of them are pretty much spank material, however as LA said that there IS a plot to this anime, there is at least a bit of character development from most of the Heart Hybrid Gear members, Aine who LA already talked about, Yurishia Farandole voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki the US candidate of the Heart Hybrid Gear had some development with her past and another minor character as well as her weaknesses in battle, Hauyuru Himekawa voiced by Juri Nagatsuma a moral committee member (quite ironic by the way) who also had some backstory to a failure that drives her to protect more people as well as the main male protagonist Hida Kizuna with his transference into the academy as well as his problems with his mother and the obvious development with his relationship to the Heart Hybrid Gear members. There is one more cast members involved in the main cast who is Sylvia Silkcut voiced by Hina Kino who helps Hida whenever she can and really she was the least developed *cough* character in the anime (though she does get some sweet upgrades in terms of HHG and \"some form of development\"). If there was a character LA liked in this anime, it would easily go to Hayuru as her mature yet tsundere personality and her even being a moral committee member becomes quite the irony for her, sure Aine has the better backstory and development and central focus but Hayuru was interesting for what screentime she was given. As for our main male protagonist Hida Kizuna, he actually isn't your typical dense main male protagonist and actually has a crux to the plot quite early in the anime and yes the obvious borderline-hentai scenes is more or less a by product as to WHY he's so important to the plot, but from his own problems with his own mother (which becomes a plot point later) to finding more about the HHG and making the plot more and more intense (NOT THAT WAY...Jesus LA is NOT intentionally making sexual innuendoes, it's just coming off like that) and driving the stakes of the plot further. Hida's obvious involvement with the other HHG members also adds to his development as an actually well-defined character albeit typical of the \"wants to protect everyone\" theme. For \"main male protagonist\" goes, he's actually pretty well done and from an excessively ecchi anime at that...what is this anime Highschool DxD <LA laughs then slowly stops>...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, done by Production IMS, is no stranger to the rather ecchi genre *cough* Shinmai Maou no Testament and really even though it is uncensored for the most part, the hentai scenes is \"ok\" at best and even though the animation derps here and there except in the hentai scenes, the background work and even the character designs do falter in it's animation derps, the fight scenes were ok at least but even the battles were struck with the janky animation, facial derps and off-handed vibrant yet blurry character palette to the dull backgrounds. The focus on the animation really went to the borderline-hentai scenes, as they were much more detailed and had less errors than the rest of the animation, it's kinda obvious where the focus Production IMS were looking at and LA really can't fault them in putting effort in the \"star attraction to this anime\", BUT can for the rest of the animation derps scattered throughout the anime. The animation overall was nothing to talk about though...\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well for a borderline-hentai anime, you'd think LA would be drooling over the \"great\" voice work, but in general, the voice cast just did decently fine across the board and LA really didn't have any problems with squeakiness either (yes even from Sylvia). LA's favorite voice actor?...well it's gonna be default but it's gonna be tie between Juri Nagatsuma who voiced Hayuru and Iori Nomizu who voiced Kei Shikina one of the central tech-hands of Amaterasu.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending by all means gave...a mediocre final battle and sure it FINALLY tells us who Aine really is and really the two main fighters in the final battle is Hida and Aine with the rest of the HHG trying to have a psychological battle with their baggage that were previous plot points to each character...hmmm Sylvia didn't get one, LA wonders WHY. Ultimately due to the few janky animation moments it made the final battle felt mediocre, but thankfully the ending gave compensation by finally revealing Aine's mystery behind her, however with the few plot threads left dangling and even more questions being brought up after the aftermath of the final battle (and to be precise the final scenes), alludes to a second season?...an OVA?...the ending overall was ok and really LA kinda expected the \"read the manga-ish ending\" considering the missing plot threads not told yet with Hida's mother and the various villains still on stand-by, so LA expected this.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH caters to two niches in the anime community for this kind of anime, those who want to see the \"ecchi more than the plot\" and those who REALLY wants to see an ecchi anime with \"actual plot\" like how Highschool DxD did before and more tamer than this and LA is squarely on both ends on this, it's disguised as a typical overblown ecchi fest but under it's layers it actually has some pretty decent plot to it and sure the animation falters in the battle scenes more than the ecchi scenes (yeah wonder why) but Masou Gakuen HxH is more or less an odd surprise for LA in the Summer 2016 lineup, ohh it's not the worst anime nor is it the \"best\", but in terms of it's genre and what it caters to, then that's where it really does shine.",

It's really solved my frustration over the fact that there are never any nipples in anime.\r\nThis is a masterpiece. After all, what masterpiece doesn't start without a full minute and a half groping scene?\r\nForget everything you know. This is the anime that changes lives, solves world hunger and cures cancer, thanks to its copious amounts of voluptous, bouncing, large, sizeable, monstrous, pillowy, soft...... plot. Niiiiiiiiice.\r\nThere's no way this isn't a parody. If it isn't I'm sure I'll lose some of mysanity.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH is a show full of everything that that is called \"cancerous\" in anime. Harem? Check. Male protagonist with the Phallus Of Fate? Check. Needless High School? Check. Ridiculous fanservice? Check. A show full of scenes so close to actual pornography that you wonder why they didn't just make this a hentai instead? Check, check, and check. This show wins the award for Thing I Most Don't Want To Explain To My Parents for this season. And yes, I'm counting Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about this show. There's big breasts, big robots, big boobs, big guns, and big bosoms. There's fingerbanging, and at one point mouth fingerbanging (I really don't think that's as sexy as they thought it would be. Kinda nasty, actually).\\n\\n\r\nIt really is all very stupid. Whether that's intended or not, I don't know. I want to believe that the people who made this are smart enough to know how stupid this is and have made it this stupid on purpose. Because the stupidity is on a whole other level with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm losing track of any points I want to make, so I'll stop here. I had some notes that I took to make sure I stayed on track, but all they say is \"Breasts aren't supposed to do that\", and \"I wonder if they have special made bras to contain their monstrously sized sheilas\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's not worth watching unless you really want to murder a few brain cells or just zone out to something you don't have to pay attention to.",

            "content": "Another harem, ecchi, romance, school, mecha, sci-fi and action anime has just ended,........I'd never understand as to why two top reviews of this anime give this anime a 10 over this simulated porn anime? Nevertheless, here were my ratings:\r\nStorywise, just another sci-fi anime where being from another world comes and threatens humanity and it's up to some individuals with such capabilities, as those otherworldly beings has and that's the plot which is the same as another anime being aired at the same season, Scared Rider Xechs, so plotwise they maybe the same , but Scared Rider Xech has more sensible story plot that this one,where everything was just about them girls getting molested by a guy or one of their own , which is why this category is a 1 over 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, I gave it an 8 over 10 and as a guy I need not tell you.......Ok, so I admit , the porn thingy got to me and the boobs.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I gave it a 6 over 10, since I just feel like it.....and I kinda like the climax (a bit) while them girls were being done by the guy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, let's see, we have the quintessential, tsudere, samurai girl, and big boob American bimbo and a guy who has to do them in order to boost them up......oh and there is the quintessential loli, that the guy also done. The rest were just whores for fantasizing, like Scarlet and her bitches and The last boss and her legion of Batlantis whores, so it's a 1 over 10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, ok so an 8 over 10, the same reason as the \"Art\" category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, If they're gonna make a season 2 of this, maybe studio Production IMS should think again, since this anime was all about boobs, orgasm and simulated porn, so overall, its a pathetic 1 over 10. So, no to season 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEROS!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "This anime is fucking dreadful. Pathetic even. Why? Because this is a fucking hentai. It's not even a fucking ecchi anymore. \r\nHere's a definition: \"Softcore hentai. Often includes panty-shots, nudity, or perverted situations. Almost always used for humor. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts.\"\r\nWas this softcore hentai at all? I doubt it.\r\nFor those that says that this anime is \"Rank No.1 Tier Ecchi\" or some shit. You gotta understand that this anime went too fucking far with its fanservice. To the point that it's not a fucking fanservice anymore. There are some screen where the MC actually rub some girl's vagina, girls climaxing whenthey got molested, kiss with graphic tongues actions, and touch em private parts, etc. Just.... Keep that shit to hentai please.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like taking a cam whore, or a cam girl from a porn website, and move those people of that site to fucking twitch, or a normal live stream sites. I mean yeah, hentai disguised as an anime will definitely get alot of attention (similar to those boob cams on twitch), plus more $ for them just because more perverts are there to watch them. Im not saying that i'm against ecchi, but this anime is taking things too far.\\n\\n\r\nThe horrible thing about these character in the series (except for the MC) is the girls with big titties. All of them literally have gigantic boob size, while some of the smaller one would get little to no screen time at all in each of the episodes. I guess that's just the author's preferences of his fantasies. And that being said, most of the girl behaviors, actions, personality, convenient character/personality/philosophy/beliefs/detest of sexual acts changes (black hair girl who's amongst the 3 main girls) really does make these girl looks so god fucking damn slutty as hell. \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh you just show my nude pics in front of every guy in school? I will just hit you with some shit, then we're cool. Coz you know, i want some of that molestation as well.\" Not gonna spoil but this is one of the scene that you should be expecting in the uncensored version.\\n\\n\r\nAnd btw, i watch the entire part of the series coz why not? This anime (should've been animated as a hentai instead) spent most of its time on some shitty drama and romance that's cringey, and so easy to win as fuck man. Like holy shit, you're a stranger, and you're a pervert.\\n\r\nGirl: \"i have a very sad life, but this guy says nice things to me just to sexually molested me. IM so fucking down into acting like a slut, or a bitch just to get em climaxes, and em power\".\\n\\n\r\nThe premise in itself is perfect for a hentai plot like that's for sure. You know hentai like Rance01? Yeah this anime is like that, there's some to little story (while spending 60% on fanservice, nudity, or even some real as hentai content etc.) but with no sex scene. But if the goal of this anime, in the sense of getting the absolute, fucking badass, highest power gain in this story. Having sex would've been a way to fucking go when these women wants to feel sexual pleasure, or get naked right in front of our protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all the shit talking, this ecchi with an actual hentai content is a good prep for your fapping session on hentaiheaven.com, animestigma, hentaiplay.net, hentaigasm or some other shit in an actual hentai sites. I like dont know why you even bother watching an ecchi of this kind.",

            "content": "I decided to put my overall in the beginning since people aren't going to read the whole review.  So just a summary would keep your attention long enough for me to get my points through.\r\n(7/10: MAL Standards \"Good\") Overall: Masou Gakuen HxH isn't as bad as people say it is.  It's enjoyable with the right mindset and if you don't decide to hate it for what it is.  Give it a try.  Know that it's going to be a harem ecchi and know what you're going to get.  You'll leave feeling satisfied.  You may not be happy, you maycrave more, but you'll leave getting what you wanted.  A Harem Ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nApart from everyone overreacting, this anime is rather mediocre in everything except enjoyment.  I'll say this here and now, in my personal opinion, this is a fun show to watch.  A guilty pleasure.  It's enjoyable.  Try it out for yourself.  Watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nI like to start by saying that: This is indeed a harem-ecchi show with loads of fan service.  I personally do not care about that, but some other reviewers seem to and react accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather plain compared to the gorgeous Hisasi art of the VN, but it's good.  Although, when I say good, I mean \"Anime Standard\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story, towards the end, is redeemable.  They're setting up a season 2.  It's interesting enough to keep you invested on a week to week basis, but it's nothing special.  It is worth watching though.  The premise is interesting once you get towards the 2nd half, things really turn up.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is boring.  Enough said.  It's forgettable and you'll hear the same battle theme over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are anime stereotypes and archetypes.  We have the tsundere, the onee-sama and...well...I don't know what Chidorigafugchi (or whatever her name is) is.  I suppose that makes it a good thing since she's part deredere and part tsundere and a few other things.  You'll know who is who.  They don't seem to grow (as usual) with the exception of Chidori who changes as the series progresses from being less cold hearted to something more...loveable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is very subjective.  I FUCKING loved it.  But that's my own shit opinion.  If you go into this only knowing that it's going to be harem ecchi and that there's going to be a lot of it, then you're pretty much set for a good time.  It won't be \"10/10\" best anime of the year material, but it's going to be fun enough.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed it partially because of the harem ecchi but mostly because of how the characters interact with each other.  It may be predictable to you, but it's always fun to see it every season.  The story itself might have been dull to some, but I found it to be rather enjoyable for what it is.  It isn't DEEP, but it's interesting enough to keep you invested for 12 episodes.  Those 12 episodes aren't all too bad either.  Mostly 5/10s and 6/10s.  The amount of boobage is hilarious and is almost a meta genre in on itself.\\n",

But, If you love about story, easily bothered by \"what is this for?\" in the story, and only looking for a great story, turn away right now. But, you can still try to watch it, maybe it could be your taste, but, this is absolutely not my taste.

            "content": "Masou Gakuen HxH is an anime that made me get up in the middle of the night to write a review on. That could be good or bad.\r\nIf you are looking for a sterotypical ecchi battle harem, this is not for you. First of all, none of the main girls are redheads. On a more serious note, has way more fanservice than your typical battle harem, so take caution. If you are looking for fanservice, then I would consider watching this anime.\r\nFirst up, the plot. Who on Earth put a story in my softcore hentai? Instead of being an anime with ecchi elements, it feelslike borderline hentai with an out of place story shoved in it.\\n\\n\r\nNotice how I used \"hentai.\" Exactly. This show goes way to far with it's fanservice. Without being too explicit about what happens, let's just say this. While many ecchi shows can be passed with a E for everybody, Masou Gakuen HxH takes the E rating and moves it past F and G all the way to H. H for hentai.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the story, there is potential. Inter-dimensional war between Earth, and the baddies, with Earth on the losing side. Teenage boy shows up at an academy for training mech users. Most of humanity on the mainland is extinct. All this points to a decent sounding story. Similar premise to Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, fanservice is thrust into the viewer's face faster than they can comprehend the plot. The immense fanservice overwhelms the story, and the story itself wasn't executed too well. This waters down what remains of the story into an incoherent mess. Especially when they thrust a scene at you, then only to reveal that the scene was either from the past or from the future for some odd reason, and it has little to no relation to what is happening in the present.\\n\\n\r\nThe story feels like a buffet dish after someone used the wrong spoon to scoop from. There are bits and pieces of other things mixed in, but you know in general what this is supposed to be. You don't necessarily like it either.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I don't judge too harshly on art, because I simply am not cultured enough to be able to differentiate good art and bad. What I can notice is inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nIn HxH, one scene can look perfectly fine, and then the next scene can look abnormal. Poorly drawn faces, etc. A big issue here is some of the character's breasts. They can look perfectly normal for a few scenes, then look like watermelons taped onto a person in the next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't usually critique sound harshly either, but I'll have to take points off here because I can't deal with the porn music.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the music for the... almost hentai scenes do not fit at all. It isn't soothing and calm enough to make you think the characters are truly happy and making love. It isn't sensual enough to make you feel the atmosphere either. It feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nImagine that you are trying to concentrate. At school or at work. Then someone lets out the nastiest fart next to you. You can live with it. But it sucks. That's how the music felt to me.\\n\\n\r\nYour mileage may vary here. Just like how some people like farts, some people find the mismatched music funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. The story is about a guy who touches women to give them power ups. There need not be proper characters. However. Let me just say this. However. When you do choose to give a bit of character to your rather bland cast, please for the love of all you hold dear, do it properly. Or at least try to.\\n\\n\r\nKizuna is our wonderful bland harem protagonist that somehow manages to get a harem all the while having all the girls outside of his harem flee from him like medieval townsfolk from the plague. He has his moments of greatness, then breaks the pedestal we put him on. Namely when he says something meaningful to solve a girl's problem, then fanservice ensues.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main girls. All have passably distinct personalities. That's okay. What isn't okay is how they develop through the story. Their problems don't feel like they are persistent. What I mean is that each episode, we have a short scene/flashback about someone's personal issues, and that very same episode (or if we're lucky, the next one) it gets solved by our main boy. Of course, being borderline softcore hentai, we forget about these moments after the next few minutes of... fanservice. It's not too much of a sex scene, no matter how much innuendos there are. Just lots of touching, feeling, and licking.\\n\\n\r\nSylvia. The cute little loli angel child who is in charge of guiding our main character. I suppose that she is meant to be a middle-schooler, but being a loli, she is literally half of our main boy's height. This isn't much of a spoiler, as any anime watcher worth their salt knows what will happen, but our angel child gets lewded. Thankfully they just cut to the very end and didn't show anything. It would have hurt me to watch that. But hey, different strokes for different folks. Just because I'm not into it doesn't mean other people aren't. The problem I have here is that it goes from 0 to 100 very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that this anime is okay, as far as my expectations go. I heard about it, expected some ecchi, but got the bare bones of an actual story along side some softcore hentai. The tone of the anime varies a bit too much. Jumping from typical battle school to super deep conversation to near sex. With the fluctuating tones, I could not bring myself to enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed others. The abrupt changes in tone made me sit back and think: \"Why am I watching this?\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLastly, my opinion, going by tags.\\n\\n\r\nThis is tagged as \"action,\" but the only noteworthy action I see is some mildly intense boy on girl action, with the occasional firing of ion cannons.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"comedy,\" but it's not very funny. You know, other than how it comically fails at everything else it does.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"romance,\" but as far as I can see it's not very romantic.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"school,\" but the only thing that makes it school-related is that the story takes place in one. I don't remember a single classroom scene with a teacher lecturing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's watchable. Watchable as in you won't die watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

After watching every season of around 350 series some patterns emerge rather clearly, one of them is that the higher the percentage of ridiculously large breasted females in an anime the worse the plot and characters usually are. This is a complete embodiment of this rule and one of the more extreme cases, here we have a guy who must have been dropped on his head a few too many dozen times surrounded by almost nothing but giant sagbags, he's got serious mommy issues and is randomly so oblivious of logical and socialcontext that half the time you almost start rooting for the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is a brainfart thrown together as an excuse to show off breasts, the very idea of \"powering up by fondling body parts\" is dumb enough on its own but many other similar dumb concepts in various animes at least made serious effort to incorporate it into the story in an interesting or amusing way. This garbage didn't even try. Frankly almost every character, event and conversation is so dumb and forced it's a pure cringe festival so for the more mentally well shaped viewer I recommend not watching this in a million years, it's not even the type of awful you can laugh at.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things I'm willing to give decent points for are the art and sound, the animation in itself is so inconsistently bobbing between terrible and good I can't even rate it but the still images tend to be on the good side. As far as sound goes the voice acting and effects suit everything quite fine, I never rate intro and outro music though and in this case that's fortunate because it would drag things down.",

The CGI Robots look awful and also look to have half the frames of everything else. A lot of time is spent focusing on the character's boobs and on the stale looking backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls have okay designs, If you put them into a group of similar looking anime girls however, I wouldn't be able to tell that they are from this show at first glance. In that sense, it's nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe Armors also look really generic and have nothing special about them.\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are mediocre to good. However I found that the regular soundtrack is extremely small, oftentimes hearing songs repeating multiple times. Of course, this isn't unreasonable, but it's still not a plus in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like Naruto where it has hundreds of episodes, so why does it repeat its music as much as Naruto? \\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nALL the characters boil down to single traits.\\n\r\nPrude Japanese Girl\\n\r\nBig Boobed American Lady\\n\r\nTsundere White Haired Girl\\n\r\n'Want to Save my Friends' MC\\n\r\nBadass Captain/Leader/Commander Girl\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI could feel myself losing my sanity as the show progressed to dumber and dumber heights. I could audibly moan at how bad it was. \\n\r\nThe drama was unbearable, and the asspulls (sometimes literal) as well.\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nFrom \u201chubs\u201d to \u201ckings,\u201d from \u201cx\u2019s\u201d to \u201creds,\u201d the Internet contains an array of pornographic possibilities.\r\nIn the old days, porn came from niche places: second-hand VHS tapes, the Sears catalog, and the occasional Polaroid picture. But with the advent of computers, all it takes is a quick Google search (after hitting CTRL+Shift+N of course) to find exactly what one\u2019s libido desires.\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH may not be smut, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mind showing off some skin. As for how its shapely curves shape up the rest of the anime, though, it has a tough timegetting its audience excited.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGakuen brings Kizuna Hida to the forefront of the war against the Magictech enemy that wiped out most of Earth\u2019s civilization. With people now living on mobile land units, those brave enough to fight don the Heart Hybrid Gear, granting them immense power. The catch? Said gears require sexual stimulation to work properly \u2013 which Kizuna is more than willing to provide.\\n\\n\r\nMost people will say (and as this review will read) that Gakuen is mainly watched for a single reason: the ecchi material. While the events therein never reach full-blown sex, the anime includes at least one new lewd scene per episode (excluding number ten and eleven). The anime offers them as censored and uncensored versions, but one is not seeing the full potential of the show through the former.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes themselves are mixed in execution.\\n\\n\r\nOn the high end, Gakuen is not afraid to delve into some kinky fetishes. Anal, masochism, and exhibitionism are never explicitly described as such. But, when Himekawa gets off on having her cat tail pulled out, Yurishia enjoys her blindfold and handcuffs, and Aine succumbs to the gazes of her fellow students, it becomes immediately clear that the show likes to spread the love.\\n\\n\r\nOn the low end, much of the content is both uninspired and repetitive. While these fetishes are explored, the sensual scenes tend to fall back on just groping butts or sucking nipples. They rarely do anything different, and, when the anime does try to switch it up with a threesome or a so-called Climax Hybrid, it still lacks creativity.\\n\\n\r\nGakuen does not reserve its sex for solely sexual purposes. Again, though, it\u2019s mixed.\\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of ecchi material forms the basis of the plot itself. Himekawa moaning in ecstasy helps to improve her relationship with Kizuna. And, by extension, allows her to develop her abilities further through higher strength and command over her Immoral Weapon (as well as simply being pleasurable to watch).\\n\\n\r\nYet it also leads into insanely bizarre instances. Kizuna presents his \u201cfindings\u201d on the Heart Hybrid Gear, sharing his \u201cdata\u201d with the rest of the males in his class under the guise of a \u201cscience project.\u201d And, later, Sylvia, the young middle-school girl that acts as Kizuna\u2019s secretary, is scouted out as a candidate for the Heart Hybrid Gear, leading to an uncomfortable, awkward situation filled with entirely unwanted and implied meaning.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the sex, Gakuen simply doesn\u2019t have much else going for it. It tries to include action sequences, but they are more a means to an end for getting Kizuna shacked up with one of the girls. Most of its villains either lack importance or are so infallible that they escape their predicaments at nearly every turn. And the show\u2019s themes on protecting others and having worth in life not by one\u2019s abilities but in how one lives does not go beyond the usual and the forgetful.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, the audience is not really checking out Gakuen for these qualities but rather a close-up shot of Himekawa\u2019s mouth dripping with saliva. But given that the ecchi material isn\u2019t anything too special, not much praise can be thrown its way.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIt does not take long for Gakuen\u2019s art and animation to falter.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \u201cfalter\u201d should be read as \u201ctanks quite unceremoniously.\u201d It\u2019s hard to watch as Kizuna and the girls flail about in their battles, falling backwards in a clumsy manner or swinging their weapon all of one time. But it turns into unintended laughter when their flying sequence is them standing still and rising into the air as if an invisible puppeteer pulled them skyward.\\n\\n\r\nWonky models eventually creep into the forefront, too, turning the hilarity into disgust. Then, when an entire idol dance scene is replaced with a bunch of still frames to avoid animating any part of it, disgust becomes disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nOn a macro scale, the setting itself does not invite intrigue. The school, over the open ocean, some beaches, a crumbled city, and the inside of the living quarters are simply boring. Worse still, Gakuen can sometimes have trouble on a technical. For instance, episode ten features Aine clipping behind clouds, ruining the perspective of the shot entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the CG enemies are more favorable at times, for they at least seem to have more animation put into them than the other parts of the show (even if they stick out way too much amidst the two-dimensional backgrounds).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to the anime\u2019s credit and like the narrative, the various sex scenes are given a lot of focus, rarely letting up in terms of visual clarity. The camera positions itself at the correct angles to show off the girls in all their glory. Breasts jiggle when released from their captivity. And the girls writhe in pleasure, their bodies refusing to cease the comingling.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the sexiness comes from the parts of the girls\u2019 designs that the audience cares most about: their generous proportions. The usual bust, waist, and hip categories are either large or curvaceous, giving the scenes the appeal they need. The rest of their individual designs are lackluster \u2013 especially their lame red-and-white school outfits \u2013 since their differentiation is almost nil besides hair color.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nGakuen\u2019s cast is not the worst. They aren\u2019t the best either, but they at least have more going for them than almost any other part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of their strength comes from the anime taking its time in establishing Aine\u2019s, Himekawa\u2019s, and Yurishia\u2019s separate conflicts. Rather than trying to cram everything into a single episode \u2013 the perhaps-expected route given the harem format \u2013 the anime does the right thing, writing out their arcs in small bits before resolving them in full.\\n\\n\r\nTake Aine. When Kizuna first meets her, she is cold, standoffish in personality. She trains extra on the side, practicing her skillset late into the night. And when she sees that Kizuna can grant her more strength (through the Heart Hybrid \u201critual\u201d), she jumps at the opportunity. Not to deepen her relationship with the man or anything else with substance \u2013 but just to get herself more strength.\\n\\n\r\nFor her self-thought weakness is a prevalent thread in her character. She feels inferior to the other girls. That all she has is her Hybrid Heart Gear, and all she has known are the experiments and Kizuna\u2019s mother since she had nothing from before her life as a \u201cguinea pig\u201d (her own words).\\n\\n\r\nShe thus takes part in the lewd activities, researched what boys like (sexy stuff, cooking), all to try and get her Immoral Weapon so that she could be stronger. To her, she must be the best because that\u2019s who she is and is meant to be (or at least she thought as such).\\n\\n\r\nKizuna, through mutual understanding, convinces her that they can \u201cthink together about how [they] can live.\u201d And, with a successful Climax Hybrid, she starts to regain memories of herself, making her happier than she has ever been.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once she starts to see ominous images and unknown lands, she pushes back. She starts not wanting to go through with the Heart Hybrid action, fearing that she will get memories back that cease to make her who she is now. The anime does not explicitly say it, but every hint points to her being from the parallel world that has invaded their own. So, essentially, she regresses back to her former self to maintain her current state \u2013 outwardly at least.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, during the final battle, when the mobile pleasure room arrives, Aine seems visibly upset. As Kizuna and Himekawa have some fun (now placing context on the first scene of the season), she cannot concentrate on the battle at hand. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have any strength,\u201d as she words it.\\n\\n\r\nCaught in a paradox of sorts, she chooses to go through with another Climax Hybrid, stating that she is who she is no matter what happens. Brushing aside her earlier two-to-three-episode regression is a mistake, but, at the minimum, she fails since the flood of new memories scares her once more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat finally sets her free is when the villain puts her into her own mind. She speaks with her younger self and walks through some videos of her past, leading to a huge door that hides what she has sought this whole season.\\n\\n\r\nGakuen falters writing-wise again when she immediately realizes that she wants to hold, touch, and feel Kizuna, protect him with all that she is and \u201cbecome one with him.\u201d Even given this misstep, she now wants power not for herself but for somebody else. She has always been lonely and distant and selfish, making this shift in her character a nice one to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ends on a cliffhanger \u2013 her sister has arrived from the other world \u2013 but, in total, Aine is a woman with a handful of different sides, goes through a lot of conflict, and comes out the better for it.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa and Yurishia are not as involved as Aine, but they have their own progression, too.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa is a part of the Disciplinary Council, doing what she can to quell any and all lewd activities around campus. She means well (even if she seems a bit na\u00efve), and she still has a kind heart when dealing with others. Initially, when Kizuna arrives, she absolutely refuses to accept the idea of committing sexual acts just to go through a Heart Hybrid. Himekawa also chastises the other girls for doing so, keeping her innocent persona up for quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nLater, Gakuen reveals her conflict. She felt as though she failed Japan when, during the first invasion, she was unable to protect her people despite being brought up as the poster child for the war effort. Her failure forced her into her current mindset, locking away her feelings of want and pleasure because she felt as though she did not deserve such happiness.\\n\\n\r\nKizuna (obviously) helps her to overcome her feelings of guilt, and, when she defeats the evil dragon (with her Immoral Weapon obtained through the stronger Climax Hybrid), she beats the past that has plagued her for far too long. Afterwards, Himekawa does not gain more attention, but it was nice to see her win.\\n\\n\r\nYurishia hails from America. With long blonde hair, a noticeable accent, and a princess-like aura about her, the other girls of the school flock to her like sweet candy. She has an outgoing personality, taking over conversations with her confidence and feminine beauty.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kizuna saves her from certain death, she practically starts to throw herself at him. But, while on their date, she gets a bit more serious, thanking Kizuna for what he did and instilling in her the want to live life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, when an old teammate by the name of Scarlett shows up, it appears Yurishia is not as perfect as she was painted as. Possibly even evil. For Scarlett talks about how Yurishia left her team to perish, earning all the glory for herself.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it was simply a misunderstanding (explained through a visualization of her memories). Yurishia did not know that a terrible enemy awaited her friends; she sent them away to protect them. While she did take the glory, she also shouldered the hate, and, with a steamy threesome (involving Kizuna), the two mend their relationship in full.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, for Himekawa and Yurishia, the anime provides nothing extensive. But at least Gakuen tried to give more beyond their sexual aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, their traits are wonderful in that they contrast sharply with their own personalities. Aine is lonely, so exhibitionist situations arouse her. Himekawa is innocent, so some dirty play gets her off. And Yurishia is dominant, so she responds immediately to submissive advances.\\n\\n\r\nConnected to them all, and indulging in the pleasures just as much, Kizuna rounds out the group. Yes, he\u2019s the everyman, given the one-of-kind, sex-empowering Hybrid Gear that permits him to almost-copulate with a bunch of beautiful women. But he has his problems, too. Mostly of the mommy variety.\\n\\n\r\nGrowing up, Kizuna did not have the best childhood. One of the very first scenes shown is how his mother literally disowns him because he is, to her, no longer useful. Gakuen does not go into much depth with his background, though, so it does not have weight to it.\\n\\n\r\nHe at least has his older sister who looks out for him, the Amaterasu group that supports him, and the gear that allows him to channel the power of those three girls. He\u2019s not powerful like them, and he isn\u2019t some dubious lecher. Rather, he\u2019s simply a guy doing his best to lead and to help those he loves.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, his mother\u2019s reappearance, working for the enemy, confuses Kizuna. And, when she continues to view people as little else but test subjects and uses them as such, Kizuna flies into a rage. She is the same now as she was back then, and that realization infuriates him.\\n\\n\r\nHis mother escapes, meaning his conflict does not see a satisfying resolution. Still, Aine, Himekawa, and Yurishia are at least explored to some extent throughout the season, giving the show a much needed boost in execution.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Gakuen both soothes and burns the eyes. In much the same way, the music caresses and grates the ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track has this science-fiction beat to it that\u2019s odd to listen to. Yet the anime pulls it off with mixing up the pacing, a kissing sound-effect, and, at times, a catchy tune. The final \u201couji-sama\u201d lyric does not fit within the structure of the song itself, but the slight harmonizing and the inclusion of piano keys keeps the song afloat.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the opening track is a lot worse off. Instruments that sound like broken trumpets, a somewhat upbeat tone that does not fit the atmosphere of the anime, and a bout of vocals that do not reach anywhere lofty. Altogether, it feels more like a mandatory inclusion rather than a piece designed for Gakuen.\\n\\n\r\nBut the original soundtrack ends up at the bottom. It has violin pieces for those sad moments and acoustic guitar ones for when things get frisky. But, like the OP, they do not impress. In fact, one track, sometimes used when the characters change into their Heart Hybrid Gear, sounds as though a ragtag rock band were playing from their garage in some random suburb. Its willy-nilly guitar and happier tone do not fit the seriousness of their transformations whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the girls moan in ecstasy during their sexual scenes (as does Kizuna during his transformation sequence near the end of the season), no notable voice acting performances were had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI cannot lie and say I wasn\u2019t aroused by this one. The lesbian scene between Grabel and Aldea was particularly steamy. And, admittedly, the show contains a fetish that I myself quite like. (As for which one that is, though, that\u2019ll be up for you, the reader, to decide.)\\n\\n\r\nI did like Himekawa and Aine as well. They were cute characters that took part in the romantic moments that I adore so much. Yurishia wasn\u2019t as fun to me due to her overly clingy behavior. In fact, I actually liked Scarlett (her friend) a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime did not hold up. Bland action sequences, drama that never made me emotional, and most of the sexual content were just gaps that separated the small scenes that I found likable. Also, it didn\u2019t help that Himekawa was somewhat ignored after her arc in the middle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, based off other websites and the ending of the first season, this one will be getting a sequel. But, given what I got here, I don\u2019t find myself checking it out anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH prioritizes sex over almost anything else. It has some passable character writing, but with a weak plot, shoddy art, and music that does not fit, there\u2019s just not enough going for it to justify sitting through these negatives. If one needs porn, spanks and eights are a much better alternative.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, all about the sex, but, even then, those scenes have a handful of faults worth noting\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, wonky, laughable, disgusting, and disappointing, but at least the sex scenes are animated well enough\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Aine, Himekawa, and Yurishia are given passable conflicts to experience or overcome, and their contrasting sexual qualities up their original foundation\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, some arousal here and there but most of the material simply lacks appeal\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "If you're worried about spoilers, ease up, you won't find any here.\r\nStory: 6/10 - The story was where I felt was weak point of the show, robot aliens that come from another dimension want to takeover the earth blah blah blah, humans make artificial islands to live on blah blah blah- you know where I'm going with this.\r\nArt & Sound: 9/10 -(I'm putting these two together because I gave them the same rating and it saves time)- The art and sound (in my opinion) are good, the CG was great for the most part, the action sequences and fight choreography were also well done, thecharacters and there armor designs were also pleasant. The vocals and music composition could be heard clearly even with my cheap lousy headphones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 - The characters themselves were... odd? I guess? There was not a lot of development for most of them and most didn't have enough of an impression to be memorable. Most of them were just generic and bland (okay you have PTSD about a past mistake, wow its not like I've seen that anywhere before). To be honest I only remember Aine, Kizuna and Sylvia only because they had the most growth, and Sylvia was the comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - All in all the show was very good, despite all my criticism, I really liked it. Most say it was terrible and gave it a low rating, I see where they're coming from, they have refined tastes and that can get in the way of fun aspects. This is an anime that is made for the enjoyment of action and sexual appeal and you can also get a genuine laugh more often then not, it has little concern for a deep story line (Although a little character development would be appreciated... Just saying) and *clears throat* \"creative\" designs. If you enjoy it, props to you if you don't, props to you. You have your opinion and I have mine.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for this review, thank you for reading :)",

            "content": "Category: Ecchi\r\nRank: Tier 1\r\nPremise: \"Suspension Bridge Effect\" It's the rapid heartbeat and arousal when in state of danger. Named after it's discovery of friends and/or people of the opposite sex tended to get married right after experiencing a tall bridge crossing. When in danger your biological alarm kicks in as a form of a reality check, All living beings are meant to procreate. The phenomenon released chemicals inducing individuals to fall in love and a need to have intercourse after a hyper sense of arousal on a very aware state.\r\nOn Masou Gakuen HxH Episode 01. Hida, Kizuna and Chidorigafuchi are under attack by an alienmecha force; the heroine in question on a almost near death situation with an already state of danger both Kizuna and Chidori blush and simultaneously suffered from rapid and increasing heartbeats. All this while Kizuna touches Aine on a erotic manner arousing her and driving her to climax. After the \"Heart x Hybrid\" takes place the heroine is seen pressing her hand against her chest when Kizuna was talking to both Himekawa Hayuru and Yurishia Farandole on a flirty manner or at least is seen in such manner by Chidorigafuchi Aines eyes. \\n\\n\r\n The name of the phenomenon \"Heart x Hybrid\" which is later explained by the commander of \"Amaterasu\" Hida Reiri, Amaterasu being the name of the Japanese force against other world invaders, Reiri says that \"HxH\" is not be outright lewd and/or actions but a state of synchronization between Body and Soul.The Heart Hybrid Phenomenon is later expanded upon on Episode 02 when Yurishia Farandole achieves this when Kizuna merely places his hand over her left breast, reinforcing that a psychological x danger requirements are a necessity rather then outright lewdness for power up as many can easily misunderstand. This means endorphin s are creating the love state whilst the human body becomes aroused with lust. This directly results on the power up of the \"Heart x Hybrid Armor\" and / or \"Magitech Armor\" as it is referenced later on the show. A weapon which is the only weapon for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nTwist: Although \"Heart x Hybrid\" grants enhanced abilities powered by the synchronization of Love and Lust. It uses spiritual energy as well as fuel, The state and power of \"Magitech Armor\" it's directly correlated to \"HxH Points\" who directly affects power output of the armor and ability to protect it's user.\\n\\n\r\nIf the Heart x Hybrid points were to reach Zero it would result in immediate death for whomever uses the armor. A fact that only the commander and/or sister or Kizuna \"Hida Reiri\" and Kizuna our MC knows. this becomes his coping mechanism as he seems to operate under the thought that lewd things and/or Heart Hybrid + Climax Hybrid are nothing more than maintenance and he does it with the outlook of protecting his comrades lives. he becomes vigilant making sure none of his team members Heart Hybrid Points reach the Danger zone which is 15% or Below. \\n\\n\r\nHeart Hybrid participants experience the power up because they all have gone through body modification, They've injected invading alien Mecha core that seems to respond to a combination of Love and Lust. Normal women don't get a power up because they can't since they haven't been modified themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi Builder: Kizuna must come up with unique ideas to accelerate healing on Heart Hybrid participants by doing lewd actions. This lewd factor absorbs the rest of the genres on a satisfactory way on which the lewdness facilitate battle engaging, Character development towards one another as well as opening up about their individual experience as human experiments growing up in order to fight other world invasion and halt humanity progress towards extinction. \\n\\n\r\nPlot Overview: 15yrs + ago humanity was attacked by another world and was humiliated into submission. Even though the enemies left most of humanity was killed and weren't seen again until 6 months prior to the present of this story. Humanity has been kicked out of their respective countries and have no other choice but to live on \"mega floats\". Artificial countries floating about on the ocean. most nations and their inhabitants have been killed off and those whom wander the ocean goal is to take back their respective countries.\\n\\n\r\nThe surviving countries all have specialized teams that can fend off the other world advanced technology. a team of people wearing the \"Magitech Armor\" and/or \"Heart x Hybrid Gear\". aside from the goal of taking back their respective lands, teams of each respective nations such as \"USA, Japan, Russia, China etc\" must seal inter-dimensional gates that serve as portal from this world to the next as well as to reclaim their land under enemy control. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Throughout the years we've seen experimentation of the anime industry to use 3D animation to reduce cost, Keep animated consistency, Facilitate mass producing of more anime and possibly keep more money for better pay while trying to keep the \"Japanese animation history\" of authenticity. They're tried from fully 3D all the way varying 2D textures on 3D models. Some kinda succeed and some end up like \"Berserk\". Most anime studios have reached the conclusion to keep 2D characters while just 3D environments. One of the first projects to do this was the anime \"Tokyo Ravens\" or earlier one like \"To Love-Ru\" season one when displaying alien creatures and some inventions but as someone who has seen \"Kizumonogatari\" movie, Shaft has mastered it.\\n\\n\r\nOn Masou Gakuen HxH there are 3D modeling but somehow Studio IMS has given a whole new breed on a 2D Fusion with 3D. The result are noticeable on the characters as they seem multi dimensional without feeling boxy like standard 3D. The art feel more fluid and more solid as per substance on the artwork. The enemies keep a higher amount of 3D but it isn't a issue since the main point of the series lies on Erotism. With that I think it was a good call.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't perfect all the time since Production IMS had their hands full the entire season handling  \"Active Raid\" simultaneously. however the episodes that did managed to get through the animation it is superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It puts hentai voice acting to shame, The voice actors /actress do a very good job at the erotic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ecchi / Harem are pretty standard, It's flooded with Tsunderes and some Kuderes. Minus the Yanderes. The writer Kuji has been paying attention to successful ecchi on the industry and has grabbed the best from past / current ecchis.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa Hayuru: it's a nitpick out of To Love Ru, Since her personality is 88% Kotegawa Yui \"The One Yelling Shameless All the time\" but twisted on a more assertive fashion and a little less tsundere. Her personality it's well thought out though as it becomes evident why \"Shameless\" things bother her and ultimately what bothers her is slacking off.\\n\\n\r\nShe is very much obsessed with morality and being proper. Himekawa also harbors the need to be competent due to her once arrogant demeanor got many Japanese citizens killed while she was on escort duty to transfer them to the Japanese mega float.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently her sense of duty is near an obsession that she is trying to get over with. she is fully aware that Ataraxia is a military school of sorts and to her relationships equals lewd things which ultimately means slacking off. her pursuit to keep people or rather students in check from doing anything it's a damage control of hers trying to keep her fellow class mates from having to experience what she saw when escorting Japanese citizens to the mega float.\\n\\n\\n\r\nChidorigafuchi Aine: An orphan who lost everything and doesn't know how much she lost. She is cold on the outside and always seems to portray a seemingly god complex to sustain her ego and maintain her constitution afloat of being the best so that she may be useful to the cause.\\n\\n\r\nHer personality is explained through her dark past and how she developed that personality. As an amnesiac orphan who sees her worth strictly correlated to her fighting capabilities. She will do anything to obtain power to maintain her world view of being worth something for capabilities only, instead of her persona. She would offer up her body if need be.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give you a blend of characters to accurately tell you about her, I would say she has a 46% Senjougahara Hitagi on regards to attitude and self worth. This also is shown on her aesthetic relationship with the MC Kizuna Hida. Then I could add a 34% Xenovia Quarta on regards to thirst of fighting and desire for power and improvement as well as some aspects to sexual matters. The remainder 20% it's up to you guys, Though personally I think is Asia Argento. Which isn't all there is since later on she becomes a different persona upon reaching a mutated state that her silver hair becomes PINK that just gives off and astounding air of confidence.\\n\\n\r\nYurishia Farandole: This character can only give you one flashback, That is the black haired beauty Akeno from High School DxD. The is a sadist and a tease all the same but on a much open form for interaction. she comes from a wealthy family of America.\\n\\n\r\nAn American on the Japanese \"Amaterasu\" team, former leader of the american \"Masters\" team. though she posses traits of a sadist she mostly gives off an older sister if not motherly vibe. she has the trait of being very protective of those she cares about and/or those on her team as made evident on episode 2 and sent Kizuna away trying to beat the danger herself and confirmed later on when her conflict with the current head of the \"Masters\" Scarlet Fairchild was revealed. Yurishia will not hesitate to lie to her peer to get them out of harms way. even if it means getting herself in deeper danger while trying to resolve what she deems great threats herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe often stresses herself being protective and like many on a position of being a care giver she deeply wishes that someone would take care of her as well. this is what opens up and new section and allows for her to become the \"receiver\" or \"masochist\" since she is into BDSM and / or S&M. as she can get into either role but harbors desire to be the one receiving the punishment since it allows her to escape all the burdens she places on herself.\\n\\n\r\nHida Kizuna : He is the troyan horse of this kind of anime and this anime in particular. At a glance it would deceive you to think he is yet another generic main character who is as dense as condensed milk and as thick as an oak tree.\\n\\n\r\n[Note: I can guarantee that if his design were different and he posses another hair color many would go gaga over him.]\\n\\n\r\nAs they say, Looks can be deceiving and this is the case for Hida Kizuna. Masamune Kuji really gave this a thought and gave us an MC with abandonment issues. As a child he was deliberately orphaned by his mother once he proved useless to her on regards to human experimentation and saw her son would prove little as a utility and wasted no time in discarding him as a ragged cloth. since he would no longer present any form of advancement for her experiments and weapon development.\\n\\n\r\nThis aspect would prove useful so that he would always seek improvement and a sense of duty to protect his peers. As prude as he is, he disregards it under the shadow of being discarded once again and he feels bound to be useful and often will be angry when told to do nothing. This quality unifies our MC with our heroines who at first went after him lusting for power. this bond with different forms of troublesome pasts that would come crucial on Heart x Hybrids which are literally Love and Lust. All born from self preservation and desire to survive. creating and ever evolving bond between our cast and deepening trust among themselves.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate the \"power\" he was lusted after or depending on the countries respective team is lusted after currently. it is because \"Heart x Hybrid Points\" takes up weeks in going back to normal and time isn't a thing anyone of this world can spare. \\n\\n\r\nEros his \"Magitech Armor\" is capable to refill anyone armor restoring in one go their fighting capabilities and capacity being god sent to the teams that wish to triumph and survive. Eros is also capable of mutating any magitech armor increasing power output and granting higher tier weaponry. the weaponry in question can be absorbed by eros granting him any variable weapon he \"Climax Hybrid\" with which would be the mutated state of the magitech armor after surpassing the limiters of recovering regarding \"Heart x Hybrid Points\". many disregarding what lewd actions and sentimental proximity needed for it to happen. However understandable why Chidorigafuchi Aine and/or other women from other \"Heart x Hybrid\" teams want to meet Kizuna and/or stay on his good graces. Kizuna represents an unprecedented advantage for humanity and certainly a trump card that can make any team who has him more resilient in battle and power in comparison to those who wait maybe even months to get back to normal once their \"Heart x Hybrid Points\" are spent. \\n\\n\r\nHida Reiri is his moral compass and support so that his inner demons don't take over and to remain relevant and useful as his sister fulfilled his mothers role. fulfilled a role that was abandoned after he was discarded by his mother shortly after vanishing altogether.\\n\\n\r\n\"A persons value isn't decided by their abilities but on how they live\" -Hida Kizuna\\n\\n\r\nA quote that Kizuna always says to himself and that he has found useful to say to many other people to comfort them as his sister has comforted him and gave him hope and his feeling of being useless and ultimately possibly discarded once he becomes useless once again.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give this character a blend to give you an analogy of who he is or where he stands. I would say he has a 26% Yuki Rito on a degree of pureness and prudeness, Followed by a 54% Basara (Shinmai Maou no Testament) on a sense of duty and desire to protect people or at least help out. The rest is unknown but the direction he is taking is that of Akatsuki Ousawa (Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero). He grows more confident as time transpires and less disturbed by lewdness as time goes on. Needless to say he can get the job done where many MC would have frozen in time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.60: Masou Gakuen HxH creates atmosphere for a good lewdness factor absorbing and not getting on the way of the other genres native to the Tier 2 Ecchi. Such as Date A Live, Infinite Stratos, Hundred, Rakudai Kishi no Calvary and Gakusen Toshi no Asterisk. The characters on Masou Gakuen HxH are designed to chemically open to one another and when it comes to designs. Kuji made the right decision getting the legendary \"Hisasi\" the Doujin artist do his/her characters.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH though giving the feeling of cramped, It's well set up since the very beginning. all characters are well knit into each other and each episode can reinforce past episode and/or set up the next on a satisfactory way.",

            "content": "Stiff and inconsistent animation with 90's quality computer graphics; monotonous, boob-obsessed fanservice; vapid characters who yell and clinch their fists a lot to create the illusion of emotion where there is none.\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH is an uninspired clone of better anime that was produced with an appropriately low budget. It takes the premise from Infinite Stratos about the one guy with an ability to help attractive female fighters, and mashes it with the master-slave relationships from Shinmai Maou no Testament using a big tit-shaped sledgehammer. HxH lacks the fun of the former, and the sex appeal of the latter.\r\nOn the positive side, Kizuna, the mainmale character, wasn't an obnoxious gynophobe or raging pervert typical of harem anime. He was usually composed and diligent, and had no qualms with engaging in lewd sexual acts. On the negative side, he didn't have any memorable personality traits to elicit empathy from the audience. In nearly every scene he only provided one of three things: exposition, generic words of encouragement, or listless pseudo-sex with a girl from his harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters weren't any better, who, in their bulky \"hybrid gear\" attire, looked like balloon animals in shitty cosplay. They were nothing more than eye candy. No depth. No agency. Just walking body parts to be gazed upon, groped, and even humiliated.\\n\\n\r\nHxH would have been more enjoyable with deeper character personalities, smarter designs, and better sex. It usually takes more than a breast and ass massage to get a girl off. They somewhat figured this out at the last episode, but by then it was too little too late.",

            "content": "I'm sure a lot of people wrote this show off without even trying it simply because of the synopsis, the cover and the genre tags, and while I can't really blame them for doing so, I'll be the first one to admit that Masou Gakuen actually had potential. It really did. It had potential because it had a premise which promotes a lot of actual sexual interaction between its characters rather than merely relying on suggestive camera angles and such. Other than the general lack of originality, my main gripe with most battle harems is that they try to have some sort of serious storywhilst simultaneously having a lot of ecchi aspects, but ultimately they end up not really succeeding on either front. Masou Gakuen however had a real chance of at least succeeding with its sexual elements, which could very well have been enough to make it an above-average ecchi anime. But unfortunately it never manages to live up to that potential, largely thanks to an abundance of severe execution errors.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise itself is about as generic and uninteresting as it gets: some alien invaders more or less conquered Earth and humanity is on its last ropes. The story then takes place at a remote high school where the students are trained to fight the extraterrestrial invaders. Sounds reasonable enough, except that humanity's last hope now rests on a group of teenagers in needlessly skimpy mecha suits powered by eroticism. Because you know, that sounds like a very reliable solution when the actual worldwide military's missiles, lasers and artillery shells evidentially weren't enough to stop them.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, we have our protagonist Hida Kizuna being sent to this school one day by his sister, with the purpose of literally fondling all the girls in it. Basically, the mecha suits in this show, called \"Heart Hybrid Gears\", can be artificially powered up by sexually stimulating its wielder, enabling them to actually stand a chance at victory against the alien threat. And that's more or less what the anime is about: the MC consistently ends up in erotic situations with various girls and makes them orgasm in order for them to be able to help protect mankind. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow I just want to make something very clear here: ending up with consistent sexual interactions is by no means a bad thing on paper. It's been proven many times in the past. The problem primarily lies with the underlying reason for why those scenes actually happen to begin with. Let's be real here, almost no one actually cares about the generic story when watching an anime like this. We're in it for the tits and ass and nothing more. So I have to ask, why do you need to go to these ridiculous lengths just to set up a scenario where sexual encounters can happen on a consistent basis? There's no reason it should have to be this complicated. Just look at something like Kiss x Sis for example: almost the entire anime revolves around two sisters lusting for their stepbrother and ending up in borderline hentai situations with him all the time. Why? Because they love him. That's literally all there is to it. We didn't need some alien invasion or mumbo jumbo ero-power or anything like that; all it took was affection, and it worked out great. But in Masou Gakuen we end up with a scenario where literally everything except for the ecchi scenes is absolutely terrible, and as a result it ends up severely dragging down the enjoyment of said ecchi scenes as well since they become so far-fetched and forced in the process.\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge make-or-break factor for ecchi/harems is of course the heroine cast, and this anime is is also a big disappointment on that front. They're all extremely shallow and stereotypical, and pretty much solely exist for the sake of being someone for the MC to get his hands on. They're the kind of girls whose entire characterization can be summarized by their breasts, and speaking of which, more than half of them also have these horrible physics-defying watermelon boobs which I'm getting seriously fed up with by now.\\n\\n\r\nOne comment you end up seeing fairly often from ecchi haters is that \"ecchi anime is useless since you could just watch hentai instead\", and while I don't agree with this logic since there are multiple other reasons to watch ecchi anime beyond just to get off to them, in Masou Gakuen's case I'm almost inclined to say it'd probably be true. Because seriously the ecchi scenes in this anime are not seductive, creative, fetishy or anything like that; they're basically censored porn. Like they're not actually having sex but we pretty much get finger banging, cunnilingus and more, and the girls are evidentially orgasming as a result of it. I mean it's literally the kind of explicit stuff that belongs in hentai, merely that we don't get to see genitalia directly. On top of that the girls are treated like nothing more than sexual objects rather than respectable characters, which is also something you'd expect to find in hentai instead. They're like walking manikins whose sole reason for existing is to be molested. Honestly I find it genuinely disrespectful, and I bet feminists would have a field day with it if they gave this anime a shot. So whenever I was watching one of the \"bonding\" scenes of Masou Gakuen, I just couldn't help but feel like there really wasn't much point to it given the available options.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of those scenes though, the anime also has some more generic and lame ecchi content such as the aforementioned skimpy mecha outfits they're all wearing. I've always wondered whether anime creators expect their viewers to be masturbating or being hyped when they put these half-naked anime girls into life-or-death battles so often... you can't both have the cake and eat it after all. Also sometimes it feels like the anime is seriously trying to enforce ecchi content when it really shouldn't, for example there's this one scene where the bad guys have captured one of the girls and are supposedly going to torture her for information, so what do they do? Of course, they decide to strip her and try to make her climax in the hopes that that'll make her talk. Not only does this make no sense from a logical standpoint, but also do you really expect me to be turned on from some cringeworthy and irrational torture scene? Like seriously?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately I just can't understand what the actual intention is behind anime like this. If they're trying to turn people on, why does the mecha fighting and cringeworthy plot elements even exist? And if they're trying to create an exciting post-apocalyptic action show, there's obviously no need for all this facepalm-worthy \"ero power\" crap. If you wanted to come up with an ecchi anime where the MC has a legitimate excuse for doing sexual things to girls on a consistent basis, you could just do something like a show with a normal guy in a normal high school who one day gets cursed so that if he doesn't do something erotic with girls on a frequent basis then something bad will happen to him, or something like that. I'm not saying that would be an amazing anime, but on paper it already sounds a lot better than what Masou Gakuen is doing, and that took me like 5 seconds to think up. The bottom line is: if you want to do a show revolving around sexual encounters, just keep things simple. Just do enough in order to make the scenes not feel forced and leave it at that. Proper execution of the ecchi scenes is literally all most of the viewers actually care about after all. Doing things the other way around is just na\u00efve and ignorant.\\n\\n\r\nSo is there anything good about Masou Gakuen in the end? Well the OP and ED were both pretty decent so that's something at least, but that's hardly enough to carry it. I guess if you're a diehard fan of all things ecchi and don't care about execution quality at all then you might want to give this a shot, but otherwise I really wouldn't recommend it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh and as the cherry on top we get an inconclusive cliffhanger ending followed by \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d. Could it possibly get any better?",

            "content": "Masou Gakuen HxH is a light novel adaptation about a bunch of scantily clad mecha-using female warriors fighting a bunch of other scantily clad mecha-using female warriors from another dimension...yes this is a light novel adaptation, why do you ask? Oh you thought it was a hentai game adaptation? Pft, when was the last time those things showed up? Anyways, continuing on from that self-inflicted interruption, the show is about these female warriors fighting each other for a reason that isn't really elaborated on because why should plot matter in an anime about underage girls fighting with their tits hanging out, with the good guyside having that one lone male who makes you question which side you're supposed to be rooting for because he's a dick and every being with an extra X chromosome falls for him anyways no matter what side they're on? Oh yeah, and these mecha suits are powered by sexual lust for some reason, thus this one guy must charge up these females' fighting energy by giving them orgasms. And whilst females in hentai can get orgasms very easily, I think the producers of this show had some sort of internal bet in regards to how little a man has to do before getting his woman wet. Because the only sex moves that show up in this thing are boob groping and what I can only assume are cowgirl positions that came out of a book called \"How To Pretend To Have Sex For Dummies\", and yet these girls react to them like they're in a Takaoka Motofumi doujin.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen one shitty harem light novel adaptation, you've seen them all, and putting in \"animated sex\" that'd embarrass a shitty flash adaptation adds pretty much nothing to the formula other than more shame, and it's not even enough shame to be noteworthy. There's a bit of paraphrasing going on in the previous paragraph, but otherwise that's pretty much the entire show. Guy gets stuck in an all-girl section of what passes for military in anime world and proceeds to toy with their emotions whilst dealing with a paint-by-the-numbers plot that even a machine by Professor Frink from The Simpsons would have been embarassed to churn out. And I didn't make that Takaoka Motofumi reference lightly. If you've never read any of his doujins, they generally consist of asshole males with bad haircuts raping females that are either big busted housewives pretending to be high schoolers or twelve-year old lolis with nipples so perky you could cut glass with them all in the name of \"love\". As such, no one is spared. Except for the sister I guess, but after seeing who gets laid in this show, you'd wish the main dude had gone the incest route instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I stuck with this show was because it seemed like it'd be a bit raunchier than the average LN series. I mean its very first scene depicted a girl taking it up the butt, which caused me to think that maybe this trash was at least going to be a little tongue-in-cheek regarding the light novel craze the way people thought that godawful Who Is Imouto anime was going to play out before it actually started taking itself seriously and turned the kinda funny stalker angle into the shittiest mystery on the planet. Even if the end result was destined to be shit, maybe it won't be that mediocre/middle-of-the-ground shit I hate so much because there's nothing to say other than it's boring. No such luck I'm afraid, because after the first episode, the show reveals that the main females are whiny tsunderes who don't know what the fuck they want whilst the main dude...um, actually he doesn't have any problems with feeling up his childhood friend and their little sister, so maybe I got a little more of my wish than I thought.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the repetitiveness of the sex moves, very little actual nudity is really shown until late in the game, and that's assuming you're watching the AT-X version rather than the laughably censored Crunchyroll version. And it always tries to be coy about it even when it does show up to the point that calling out someone else's name during intercourse would be less of a turn-off. I know it sells and all, but I think Production IMS missed a few memos when they decided to become a fanservice studio, because there are a few things you have to keep in mind with porn assuming you're a teenage boy or lesbian who wants to please their frustrated libido without having to pay for it like a loser. One, most porn is absolute shit. I remember when I was introduced to my first porn site and trying to find something that was actually arousing was like trying to find a hot woman in a nude beach that's not in Central America. Two, most successful porn are executed with characters that have confidence, and the only confidence you can expect out of light novel stereotypes are the wishy-washy kind that get mad at their men for interacting with women who have every right to do so on account of them not being \"girls\". Three, your anime is on broadcast TV. Even with the horrible censors, you can't actually show stuff with real balls, let alone real balls. Four, just because you're making smut doesn't mean it has to be low-budget. Get some goddamn money rolling into your products, dudes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets particularly shitty in the final few episodes where the loli joins the fray for absolutely no reason whatsoever other than because the show felt like it wasn't pedo enough and decided it might as well go the extra mile. I have a few companions online who like watching this sort of perverted trash, and they all agreed that the show went too far when she got involved. Better not introduce them to the doujin series, Rapiere. They'd probably set themselves on fire if they saw just how low a female version of The Three Musketeers could sink. See, for a show that sells itself on using sex as a weapon, I was expecting something on the level of Sausage Party or Dororon Meera Mera Enma-kun where the big evil is defeated by a giant orgy and the main dude's sexual prowess is so powerful that he ends up getting every female in the world to leak sweat just by his mere aura, including the big evil. But no, the show ends with a bunch of poorly done action scenes followed by the main dude holding hands with the white-haired girl, who I think is supposed to be the main female lead, but the show doesn't do a good job of convincing me on that front for reasons I'm not going to get into because you don't care. Talk about a show that climaxed too early, huh?\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH wanted to prove to the world that it had a big dick, so it took a bunch of forbidden substances to give off the illusion that it could stand alongside the \"manly\" anime, only to end up getting too overexcited to the point that it blew its load early and ended up pretty pointless the rest of the way through. Its animation was flaccid, its characters limp, its comedy plain sucked, and what passes for sex and a plot just hurts to think about. Can't really see much of anything to recommend about the show. Even a heavily censored hentai on Youtube would be more exciting to watch, if only because there's a certain absurd humor to be found in how only ten percent of the screen is actually visible whilst the other ninety percent is so blurry you'd have better visibility watching the real thing underwater.",

            "content": "Porn with a Plot, yeah went straight into it huh...no but seriously.\r\nLA will be straight with you, LA had obvious reasons to try and NOT watch this anime for Summer 2016, however Masou Gakuen HxH still surprised LA for even ecchi standards...it was still awkward, hell yes, but still for the people thinking this anime is nothing but a borderline hentai...well yeah...but even a hentai has something of a plot....\"something\" being the emphasis.\r\nLike just from reading the premise, this anime is like Infinite Stratos but ramp up the fanservice levels to GODLY, then just add in the borderline hentai sex scenes and you have MasouGakuen HxH, but Masou Gakuen HxH has even a sliver of a plot LA can get interested (omitting the sex scenes anyways). What's the sliver of plot LA was soo interested in?.\\n\\n\r\nIt was the entire mystery to Aine Chidorigafuchi voiced by Akari Kageyama, as to who she is and why the mystery connection to the Magitech and the more dangerous Commanders of the Magitech, why are the invading Magitech forces want, the significance of Hida Kizuna the main protagonist and his \"only one man's special powers\" along with his mother issues, all these questions link Aine and Hida together. LA did say a silver you know, however that \"silver\" of a plot is what makes this anime move forward and it becomes intriguing as long as you see behind all the borderline-hentai.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice...well considering that this anime got out uncensored was quite baffling but all the more, LA did say that the fanservice was in GODLY levels, everything from uncensored boobs to foreplay and even threesomes and BDSM...don't ask why LA knows these. *cough* either way, Masou Gakuen HxH's focus on it's borderline hentai scenes as it encompasses a rather minority of the anime where even though it has \"hentai scenes\" once every episode, the main focus rather goes to developing the main cast of the Heart Hybrid Gear users and Hida Kizuna voiced by Kenji Akabane. But seriously you SHOULD know what your going into when watching this anime...it's on the PREMISE people.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, you'd think most of them are pretty much spank material, however as LA said that there IS a plot to this anime, there is at least a bit of character development from most of the Heart Hybrid Gear members, Aine who LA already talked about, Yurishia Farandole voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki the US candidate of the Heart Hybrid Gear had some development with her past and another minor character as well as her weaknesses in battle, Hauyuru Himekawa voiced by Juri Nagatsuma a moral committee member (quite ironic by the way) who also had some backstory to a failure that drives her to protect more people as well as the main male protagonist Hida Kizuna with his transference into the academy as well as his problems with his mother and the obvious development with his relationship to the Heart Hybrid Gear members. There is one more cast members involved in the main cast who is Sylvia Silkcut voiced by Hina Kino who helps Hida whenever she can and really she was the least developed *cough* character in the anime (though she does get some sweet upgrades in terms of HHG and \"some form of development\"). If there was a character LA liked in this anime, it would easily go to Hayuru as her mature yet tsundere personality and her even being a moral committee member becomes quite the irony for her, sure Aine has the better backstory and development and central focus but Hayuru was interesting for what screentime she was given. As for our main male protagonist Hida Kizuna, he actually isn't your typical dense main male protagonist and actually has a crux to the plot quite early in the anime and yes the obvious borderline-hentai scenes is more or less a by product as to WHY he's so important to the plot, but from his own problems with his own mother (which becomes a plot point later) to finding more about the HHG and making the plot more and more intense (NOT THAT WAY...Jesus LA is NOT intentionally making sexual innuendoes, it's just coming off like that) and driving the stakes of the plot further. Hida's obvious involvement with the other HHG members also adds to his development as an actually well-defined character albeit typical of the \"wants to protect everyone\" theme. For \"main male protagonist\" goes, he's actually pretty well done and from an excessively ecchi anime at that...what is this anime Highschool DxD <LA laughs then slowly stops>...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, done by Production IMS, is no stranger to the rather ecchi genre *cough* Shinmai Maou no Testament and really even though it is uncensored for the most part, the hentai scenes is \"ok\" at best and even though the animation derps here and there except in the hentai scenes, the background work and even the character designs do falter in it's animation derps, the fight scenes were ok at least but even the battles were struck with the janky animation, facial derps and off-handed vibrant yet blurry character palette to the dull backgrounds. The focus on the animation really went to the borderline-hentai scenes, as they were much more detailed and had less errors than the rest of the animation, it's kinda obvious where the focus Production IMS were looking at and LA really can't fault them in putting effort in the \"star attraction to this anime\", BUT can for the rest of the animation derps scattered throughout the anime. The animation overall was nothing to talk about though...\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well for a borderline-hentai anime, you'd think LA would be drooling over the \"great\" voice work, but in general, the voice cast just did decently fine across the board and LA really didn't have any problems with squeakiness either (yes even from Sylvia). LA's favorite voice actor?...well it's gonna be default but it's gonna be tie between Juri Nagatsuma who voiced Hayuru and Iori Nomizu who voiced Kei Shikina one of the central tech-hands of Amaterasu.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending by all means gave...a mediocre final battle and sure it FINALLY tells us who Aine really is and really the two main fighters in the final battle is Hida and Aine with the rest of the HHG trying to have a psychological battle with their baggage that were previous plot points to each character...hmmm Sylvia didn't get one, LA wonders WHY. Ultimately due to the few janky animation moments it made the final battle felt mediocre, but thankfully the ending gave compensation by finally revealing Aine's mystery behind her, however with the few plot threads left dangling and even more questions being brought up after the aftermath of the final battle (and to be precise the final scenes), alludes to a second season?...an OVA?...the ending overall was ok and really LA kinda expected the \"read the manga-ish ending\" considering the missing plot threads not told yet with Hida's mother and the various villains still on stand-by, so LA expected this.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH caters to two niches in the anime community for this kind of anime, those who want to see the \"ecchi more than the plot\" and those who REALLY wants to see an ecchi anime with \"actual plot\" like how Highschool DxD did before and more tamer than this and LA is squarely on both ends on this, it's disguised as a typical overblown ecchi fest but under it's layers it actually has some pretty decent plot to it and sure the animation falters in the battle scenes more than the ecchi scenes (yeah wonder why) but Masou Gakuen HxH is more or less an odd surprise for LA in the Summer 2016 lineup, ohh it's not the worst anime nor is it the \"best\", but in terms of it's genre and what it caters to, then that's where it really does shine.",

It's really solved my frustration over the fact that there are never any nipples in anime.\r\nThis is a masterpiece. After all, what masterpiece doesn't start without a full minute and a half groping scene?\r\nForget everything you know. This is the anime that changes lives, solves world hunger and cures cancer, thanks to its copious amounts of voluptous, bouncing, large, sizeable, monstrous, pillowy, soft...... plot. Niiiiiiiiice.\r\nThere's no way this isn't a parody. If it isn't I'm sure I'll lose some of mysanity.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH is a show full of everything that that is called \"cancerous\" in anime. Harem? Check. Male protagonist with the Phallus Of Fate? Check. Needless High School? Check. Ridiculous fanservice? Check. A show full of scenes so close to actual pornography that you wonder why they didn't just make this a hentai instead? Check, check, and check. This show wins the award for Thing I Most Don't Want To Explain To My Parents for this season. And yes, I'm counting Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about this show. There's big breasts, big robots, big boobs, big guns, and big bosoms. There's fingerbanging, and at one point mouth fingerbanging (I really don't think that's as sexy as they thought it would be. Kinda nasty, actually).\\n\\n\r\nIt really is all very stupid. Whether that's intended or not, I don't know. I want to believe that the people who made this are smart enough to know how stupid this is and have made it this stupid on purpose. Because the stupidity is on a whole other level with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI'm losing track of any points I want to make, so I'll stop here. I had some notes that I took to make sure I stayed on track, but all they say is \"Breasts aren't supposed to do that\", and \"I wonder if they have special made bras to contain their monstrously sized sheilas\".\\n\\n\r\nIt's not worth watching unless you really want to murder a few brain cells or just zone out to something you don't have to pay attention to.",

            "content": "Another harem, ecchi, romance, school, mecha, sci-fi and action anime has just ended,........I'd never understand as to why two top reviews of this anime give this anime a 10 over this simulated porn anime? Nevertheless, here were my ratings:\r\nStorywise, just another sci-fi anime where being from another world comes and threatens humanity and it's up to some individuals with such capabilities, as those otherworldly beings has and that's the plot which is the same as another anime being aired at the same season, Scared Rider Xechs, so plotwise they maybe the same , but Scared Rider Xech has more sensible story plot that this one,where everything was just about them girls getting molested by a guy or one of their own , which is why this category is a 1 over 10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, I gave it an 8 over 10 and as a guy I need not tell you.......Ok, so I admit , the porn thingy got to me and the boobs.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I gave it a 6 over 10, since I just feel like it.....and I kinda like the climax (a bit) while them girls were being done by the guy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, let's see, we have the quintessential, tsudere, samurai girl, and big boob American bimbo and a guy who has to do them in order to boost them up......oh and there is the quintessential loli, that the guy also done. The rest were just whores for fantasizing, like Scarlet and her bitches and The last boss and her legion of Batlantis whores, so it's a 1 over 10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, ok so an 8 over 10, the same reason as the \"Art\" category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, If they're gonna make a season 2 of this, maybe studio Production IMS should think again, since this anime was all about boobs, orgasm and simulated porn, so overall, its a pathetic 1 over 10. So, no to season 2.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEROS!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "This anime is fucking dreadful. Pathetic even. Why? Because this is a fucking hentai. It's not even a fucking ecchi anymore. \r\nHere's a definition: \"Softcore hentai. Often includes panty-shots, nudity, or perverted situations. Almost always used for humor. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts.\"\r\nWas this softcore hentai at all? I doubt it.\r\nFor those that says that this anime is \"Rank No.1 Tier Ecchi\" or some shit. You gotta understand that this anime went too fucking far with its fanservice. To the point that it's not a fucking fanservice anymore. There are some screen where the MC actually rub some girl's vagina, girls climaxing whenthey got molested, kiss with graphic tongues actions, and touch em private parts, etc. Just.... Keep that shit to hentai please.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like taking a cam whore, or a cam girl from a porn website, and move those people of that site to fucking twitch, or a normal live stream sites. I mean yeah, hentai disguised as an anime will definitely get alot of attention (similar to those boob cams on twitch), plus more $ for them just because more perverts are there to watch them. Im not saying that i'm against ecchi, but this anime is taking things too far.\\n\\n\r\nThe horrible thing about these character in the series (except for the MC) is the girls with big titties. All of them literally have gigantic boob size, while some of the smaller one would get little to no screen time at all in each of the episodes. I guess that's just the author's preferences of his fantasies. And that being said, most of the girl behaviors, actions, personality, convenient character/personality/philosophy/beliefs/detest of sexual acts changes (black hair girl who's amongst the 3 main girls) really does make these girl looks so god fucking damn slutty as hell. \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh you just show my nude pics in front of every guy in school? I will just hit you with some shit, then we're cool. Coz you know, i want some of that molestation as well.\" Not gonna spoil but this is one of the scene that you should be expecting in the uncensored version.\\n\\n\r\nAnd btw, i watch the entire part of the series coz why not? This anime (should've been animated as a hentai instead) spent most of its time on some shitty drama and romance that's cringey, and so easy to win as fuck man. Like holy shit, you're a stranger, and you're a pervert.\\n\r\nGirl: \"i have a very sad life, but this guy says nice things to me just to sexually molested me. IM so fucking down into acting like a slut, or a bitch just to get em climaxes, and em power\".\\n\\n\r\nThe premise in itself is perfect for a hentai plot like that's for sure. You know hentai like Rance01? Yeah this anime is like that, there's some to little story (while spending 60% on fanservice, nudity, or even some real as hentai content etc.) but with no sex scene. But if the goal of this anime, in the sense of getting the absolute, fucking badass, highest power gain in this story. Having sex would've been a way to fucking go when these women wants to feel sexual pleasure, or get naked right in front of our protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nBut despite all the shit talking, this ecchi with an actual hentai content is a good prep for your fapping session on hentaiheaven.com, animestigma, hentaiplay.net, hentaigasm or some other shit in an actual hentai sites. I like dont know why you even bother watching an ecchi of this kind.",

            "content": "I decided to put my overall in the beginning since people aren't going to read the whole review.  So just a summary would keep your attention long enough for me to get my points through.\r\n(7/10: MAL Standards \"Good\") Overall: Masou Gakuen HxH isn't as bad as people say it is.  It's enjoyable with the right mindset and if you don't decide to hate it for what it is.  Give it a try.  Know that it's going to be a harem ecchi and know what you're going to get.  You'll leave feeling satisfied.  You may not be happy, you maycrave more, but you'll leave getting what you wanted.  A Harem Ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nApart from everyone overreacting, this anime is rather mediocre in everything except enjoyment.  I'll say this here and now, in my personal opinion, this is a fun show to watch.  A guilty pleasure.  It's enjoyable.  Try it out for yourself.  Watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nI like to start by saying that: This is indeed a harem-ecchi show with loads of fan service.  I personally do not care about that, but some other reviewers seem to and react accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is rather plain compared to the gorgeous Hisasi art of the VN, but it's good.  Although, when I say good, I mean \"Anime Standard\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story, towards the end, is redeemable.  They're setting up a season 2.  It's interesting enough to keep you invested on a week to week basis, but it's nothing special.  It is worth watching though.  The premise is interesting once you get towards the 2nd half, things really turn up.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is boring.  Enough said.  It's forgettable and you'll hear the same battle theme over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are anime stereotypes and archetypes.  We have the tsundere, the onee-sama and...well...I don't know what Chidorigafugchi (or whatever her name is) is.  I suppose that makes it a good thing since she's part deredere and part tsundere and a few other things.  You'll know who is who.  They don't seem to grow (as usual) with the exception of Chidori who changes as the series progresses from being less cold hearted to something more...loveable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is very subjective.  I FUCKING loved it.  But that's my own shit opinion.  If you go into this only knowing that it's going to be harem ecchi and that there's going to be a lot of it, then you're pretty much set for a good time.  It won't be \"10/10\" best anime of the year material, but it's going to be fun enough.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed it partially because of the harem ecchi but mostly because of how the characters interact with each other.  It may be predictable to you, but it's always fun to see it every season.  The story itself might have been dull to some, but I found it to be rather enjoyable for what it is.  It isn't DEEP, but it's interesting enough to keep you invested for 12 episodes.  Those 12 episodes aren't all too bad either.  Mostly 5/10s and 6/10s.  The amount of boobage is hilarious and is almost a meta genre in on itself.\\n",

But, If you love about story, easily bothered by \"what is this for?\" in the story, and only looking for a great story, turn away right now. But, you can still try to watch it, maybe it could be your taste, but, this is absolutely not my taste.

            "content": "Masou Gakuen HxH is an anime that made me get up in the middle of the night to write a review on. That could be good or bad.\r\nIf you are looking for a sterotypical ecchi battle harem, this is not for you. First of all, none of the main girls are redheads. On a more serious note, has way more fanservice than your typical battle harem, so take caution. If you are looking for fanservice, then I would consider watching this anime.\r\nFirst up, the plot. Who on Earth put a story in my softcore hentai? Instead of being an anime with ecchi elements, it feelslike borderline hentai with an out of place story shoved in it.\\n\\n\r\nNotice how I used \"hentai.\" Exactly. This show goes way to far with it's fanservice. Without being too explicit about what happens, let's just say this. While many ecchi shows can be passed with a E for everybody, Masou Gakuen HxH takes the E rating and moves it past F and G all the way to H. H for hentai.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the story, there is potential. Inter-dimensional war between Earth, and the baddies, with Earth on the losing side. Teenage boy shows up at an academy for training mech users. Most of humanity on the mainland is extinct. All this points to a decent sounding story. Similar premise to Aldnoah.Zero.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, fanservice is thrust into the viewer's face faster than they can comprehend the plot. The immense fanservice overwhelms the story, and the story itself wasn't executed too well. This waters down what remains of the story into an incoherent mess. Especially when they thrust a scene at you, then only to reveal that the scene was either from the past or from the future for some odd reason, and it has little to no relation to what is happening in the present.\\n\\n\r\nThe story feels like a buffet dish after someone used the wrong spoon to scoop from. There are bits and pieces of other things mixed in, but you know in general what this is supposed to be. You don't necessarily like it either.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I don't judge too harshly on art, because I simply am not cultured enough to be able to differentiate good art and bad. What I can notice is inconsistency.\\n\\n\r\nIn HxH, one scene can look perfectly fine, and then the next scene can look abnormal. Poorly drawn faces, etc. A big issue here is some of the character's breasts. They can look perfectly normal for a few scenes, then look like watermelons taped onto a person in the next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't usually critique sound harshly either, but I'll have to take points off here because I can't deal with the porn music.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the music for the... almost hentai scenes do not fit at all. It isn't soothing and calm enough to make you think the characters are truly happy and making love. It isn't sensual enough to make you feel the atmosphere either. It feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nImagine that you are trying to concentrate. At school or at work. Then someone lets out the nastiest fart next to you. You can live with it. But it sucks. That's how the music felt to me.\\n\\n\r\nYour mileage may vary here. Just like how some people like farts, some people find the mismatched music funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. The story is about a guy who touches women to give them power ups. There need not be proper characters. However. Let me just say this. However. When you do choose to give a bit of character to your rather bland cast, please for the love of all you hold dear, do it properly. Or at least try to.\\n\\n\r\nKizuna is our wonderful bland harem protagonist that somehow manages to get a harem all the while having all the girls outside of his harem flee from him like medieval townsfolk from the plague. He has his moments of greatness, then breaks the pedestal we put him on. Namely when he says something meaningful to solve a girl's problem, then fanservice ensues.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main girls. All have passably distinct personalities. That's okay. What isn't okay is how they develop through the story. Their problems don't feel like they are persistent. What I mean is that each episode, we have a short scene/flashback about someone's personal issues, and that very same episode (or if we're lucky, the next one) it gets solved by our main boy. Of course, being borderline softcore hentai, we forget about these moments after the next few minutes of... fanservice. It's not too much of a sex scene, no matter how much innuendos there are. Just lots of touching, feeling, and licking.\\n\\n\r\nSylvia. The cute little loli angel child who is in charge of guiding our main character. I suppose that she is meant to be a middle-schooler, but being a loli, she is literally half of our main boy's height. This isn't much of a spoiler, as any anime watcher worth their salt knows what will happen, but our angel child gets lewded. Thankfully they just cut to the very end and didn't show anything. It would have hurt me to watch that. But hey, different strokes for different folks. Just because I'm not into it doesn't mean other people aren't. The problem I have here is that it goes from 0 to 100 very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that this anime is okay, as far as my expectations go. I heard about it, expected some ecchi, but got the bare bones of an actual story along side some softcore hentai. The tone of the anime varies a bit too much. Jumping from typical battle school to super deep conversation to near sex. With the fluctuating tones, I could not bring myself to enjoy this anime as much as I enjoyed others. The abrupt changes in tone made me sit back and think: \"Why am I watching this?\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nLastly, my opinion, going by tags.\\n\\n\r\nThis is tagged as \"action,\" but the only noteworthy action I see is some mildly intense boy on girl action, with the occasional firing of ion cannons.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"comedy,\" but it's not very funny. You know, other than how it comically fails at everything else it does.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"romance,\" but as far as I can see it's not very romantic.\\n\\n\r\nTagged \"school,\" but the only thing that makes it school-related is that the story takes place in one. I don't remember a single classroom scene with a teacher lecturing.\\n\\n\r\nIt's watchable. Watchable as in you won't die watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

After watching every season of around 350 series some patterns emerge rather clearly, one of them is that the higher the percentage of ridiculously large breasted females in an anime the worse the plot and characters usually are. This is a complete embodiment of this rule and one of the more extreme cases, here we have a guy who must have been dropped on his head a few too many dozen times surrounded by almost nothing but giant sagbags, he's got serious mommy issues and is randomly so oblivious of logical and socialcontext that half the time you almost start rooting for the bad guys.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is a brainfart thrown together as an excuse to show off breasts, the very idea of \"powering up by fondling body parts\" is dumb enough on its own but many other similar dumb concepts in various animes at least made serious effort to incorporate it into the story in an interesting or amusing way. This garbage didn't even try. Frankly almost every character, event and conversation is so dumb and forced it's a pure cringe festival so for the more mentally well shaped viewer I recommend not watching this in a million years, it's not even the type of awful you can laugh at.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things I'm willing to give decent points for are the art and sound, the animation in itself is so inconsistently bobbing between terrible and good I can't even rate it but the still images tend to be on the good side. As far as sound goes the voice acting and effects suit everything quite fine, I never rate intro and outro music though and in this case that's fortunate because it would drag things down.",

The CGI Robots look awful and also look to have half the frames of everything else. A lot of time is spent focusing on the character's boobs and on the stale looking backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls have okay designs, If you put them into a group of similar looking anime girls however, I wouldn't be able to tell that they are from this show at first glance. In that sense, it's nothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe Armors also look really generic and have nothing special about them.\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are mediocre to good. However I found that the regular soundtrack is extremely small, oftentimes hearing songs repeating multiple times. Of course, this isn't unreasonable, but it's still not a plus in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not like Naruto where it has hundreds of episodes, so why does it repeat its music as much as Naruto? \\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nALL the characters boil down to single traits.\\n\r\nPrude Japanese Girl\\n\r\nBig Boobed American Lady\\n\r\nTsundere White Haired Girl\\n\r\n'Want to Save my Friends' MC\\n\r\nBadass Captain/Leader/Commander Girl\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI could feel myself losing my sanity as the show progressed to dumber and dumber heights. I could audibly moan at how bad it was. \\n\r\nThe drama was unbearable, and the asspulls (sometimes literal) as well.\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nFrom \u201chubs\u201d to \u201ckings,\u201d from \u201cx\u2019s\u201d to \u201creds,\u201d the Internet contains an array of pornographic possibilities.\r\nIn the old days, porn came from niche places: second-hand VHS tapes, the Sears catalog, and the occasional Polaroid picture. But with the advent of computers, all it takes is a quick Google search (after hitting CTRL+Shift+N of course) to find exactly what one\u2019s libido desires.\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH may not be smut, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mind showing off some skin. As for how its shapely curves shape up the rest of the anime, though, it has a tough timegetting its audience excited.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGakuen brings Kizuna Hida to the forefront of the war against the Magictech enemy that wiped out most of Earth\u2019s civilization. With people now living on mobile land units, those brave enough to fight don the Heart Hybrid Gear, granting them immense power. The catch? Said gears require sexual stimulation to work properly \u2013 which Kizuna is more than willing to provide.\\n\\n\r\nMost people will say (and as this review will read) that Gakuen is mainly watched for a single reason: the ecchi material. While the events therein never reach full-blown sex, the anime includes at least one new lewd scene per episode (excluding number ten and eleven). The anime offers them as censored and uncensored versions, but one is not seeing the full potential of the show through the former.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenes themselves are mixed in execution.\\n\\n\r\nOn the high end, Gakuen is not afraid to delve into some kinky fetishes. Anal, masochism, and exhibitionism are never explicitly described as such. But, when Himekawa gets off on having her cat tail pulled out, Yurishia enjoys her blindfold and handcuffs, and Aine succumbs to the gazes of her fellow students, it becomes immediately clear that the show likes to spread the love.\\n\\n\r\nOn the low end, much of the content is both uninspired and repetitive. While these fetishes are explored, the sensual scenes tend to fall back on just groping butts or sucking nipples. They rarely do anything different, and, when the anime does try to switch it up with a threesome or a so-called Climax Hybrid, it still lacks creativity.\\n\\n\r\nGakuen does not reserve its sex for solely sexual purposes. Again, though, it\u2019s mixed.\\n\\n\r\nThe inclusion of ecchi material forms the basis of the plot itself. Himekawa moaning in ecstasy helps to improve her relationship with Kizuna. And, by extension, allows her to develop her abilities further through higher strength and command over her Immoral Weapon (as well as simply being pleasurable to watch).\\n\\n\r\nYet it also leads into insanely bizarre instances. Kizuna presents his \u201cfindings\u201d on the Heart Hybrid Gear, sharing his \u201cdata\u201d with the rest of the males in his class under the guise of a \u201cscience project.\u201d And, later, Sylvia, the young middle-school girl that acts as Kizuna\u2019s secretary, is scouted out as a candidate for the Heart Hybrid Gear, leading to an uncomfortable, awkward situation filled with entirely unwanted and implied meaning.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the sex, Gakuen simply doesn\u2019t have much else going for it. It tries to include action sequences, but they are more a means to an end for getting Kizuna shacked up with one of the girls. Most of its villains either lack importance or are so infallible that they escape their predicaments at nearly every turn. And the show\u2019s themes on protecting others and having worth in life not by one\u2019s abilities but in how one lives does not go beyond the usual and the forgetful.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, the audience is not really checking out Gakuen for these qualities but rather a close-up shot of Himekawa\u2019s mouth dripping with saliva. But given that the ecchi material isn\u2019t anything too special, not much praise can be thrown its way.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIt does not take long for Gakuen\u2019s art and animation to falter.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \u201cfalter\u201d should be read as \u201ctanks quite unceremoniously.\u201d It\u2019s hard to watch as Kizuna and the girls flail about in their battles, falling backwards in a clumsy manner or swinging their weapon all of one time. But it turns into unintended laughter when their flying sequence is them standing still and rising into the air as if an invisible puppeteer pulled them skyward.\\n\\n\r\nWonky models eventually creep into the forefront, too, turning the hilarity into disgust. Then, when an entire idol dance scene is replaced with a bunch of still frames to avoid animating any part of it, disgust becomes disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nOn a macro scale, the setting itself does not invite intrigue. The school, over the open ocean, some beaches, a crumbled city, and the inside of the living quarters are simply boring. Worse still, Gakuen can sometimes have trouble on a technical. For instance, episode ten features Aine clipping behind clouds, ruining the perspective of the shot entirely.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the CG enemies are more favorable at times, for they at least seem to have more animation put into them than the other parts of the show (even if they stick out way too much amidst the two-dimensional backgrounds).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to the anime\u2019s credit and like the narrative, the various sex scenes are given a lot of focus, rarely letting up in terms of visual clarity. The camera positions itself at the correct angles to show off the girls in all their glory. Breasts jiggle when released from their captivity. And the girls writhe in pleasure, their bodies refusing to cease the comingling.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the sexiness comes from the parts of the girls\u2019 designs that the audience cares most about: their generous proportions. The usual bust, waist, and hip categories are either large or curvaceous, giving the scenes the appeal they need. The rest of their individual designs are lackluster \u2013 especially their lame red-and-white school outfits \u2013 since their differentiation is almost nil besides hair color.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nGakuen\u2019s cast is not the worst. They aren\u2019t the best either, but they at least have more going for them than almost any other part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of their strength comes from the anime taking its time in establishing Aine\u2019s, Himekawa\u2019s, and Yurishia\u2019s separate conflicts. Rather than trying to cram everything into a single episode \u2013 the perhaps-expected route given the harem format \u2013 the anime does the right thing, writing out their arcs in small bits before resolving them in full.\\n\\n\r\nTake Aine. When Kizuna first meets her, she is cold, standoffish in personality. She trains extra on the side, practicing her skillset late into the night. And when she sees that Kizuna can grant her more strength (through the Heart Hybrid \u201critual\u201d), she jumps at the opportunity. Not to deepen her relationship with the man or anything else with substance \u2013 but just to get herself more strength.\\n\\n\r\nFor her self-thought weakness is a prevalent thread in her character. She feels inferior to the other girls. That all she has is her Hybrid Heart Gear, and all she has known are the experiments and Kizuna\u2019s mother since she had nothing from before her life as a \u201cguinea pig\u201d (her own words).\\n\\n\r\nShe thus takes part in the lewd activities, researched what boys like (sexy stuff, cooking), all to try and get her Immoral Weapon so that she could be stronger. To her, she must be the best because that\u2019s who she is and is meant to be (or at least she thought as such).\\n\\n\r\nKizuna, through mutual understanding, convinces her that they can \u201cthink together about how [they] can live.\u201d And, with a successful Climax Hybrid, she starts to regain memories of herself, making her happier than she has ever been.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once she starts to see ominous images and unknown lands, she pushes back. She starts not wanting to go through with the Heart Hybrid action, fearing that she will get memories back that cease to make her who she is now. The anime does not explicitly say it, but every hint points to her being from the parallel world that has invaded their own. So, essentially, she regresses back to her former self to maintain her current state \u2013 outwardly at least.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, during the final battle, when the mobile pleasure room arrives, Aine seems visibly upset. As Kizuna and Himekawa have some fun (now placing context on the first scene of the season), she cannot concentrate on the battle at hand. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have any strength,\u201d as she words it.\\n\\n\r\nCaught in a paradox of sorts, she chooses to go through with another Climax Hybrid, stating that she is who she is no matter what happens. Brushing aside her earlier two-to-three-episode regression is a mistake, but, at the minimum, she fails since the flood of new memories scares her once more.\\n\\n\r\nWhat finally sets her free is when the villain puts her into her own mind. She speaks with her younger self and walks through some videos of her past, leading to a huge door that hides what she has sought this whole season.\\n\\n\r\nGakuen falters writing-wise again when she immediately realizes that she wants to hold, touch, and feel Kizuna, protect him with all that she is and \u201cbecome one with him.\u201d Even given this misstep, she now wants power not for herself but for somebody else. She has always been lonely and distant and selfish, making this shift in her character a nice one to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ends on a cliffhanger \u2013 her sister has arrived from the other world \u2013 but, in total, Aine is a woman with a handful of different sides, goes through a lot of conflict, and comes out the better for it.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa and Yurishia are not as involved as Aine, but they have their own progression, too.\\n\\n\r\nHimekawa is a part of the Disciplinary Council, doing what she can to quell any and all lewd activities around campus. She means well (even if she seems a bit na\u00efve), and she still has a kind heart when dealing with others. Initially, when Kizuna arrives, she absolutely refuses to accept the idea of committing sexual acts just to go through a Heart Hybrid. Himekawa also chastises the other girls for doing so, keeping her innocent persona up for quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nLater, Gakuen reveals her conflict. She felt as though she failed Japan when, during the first invasion, she was unable to protect her people despite being brought up as the poster child for the war effort. Her failure forced her into her current mindset, locking away her feelings of want and pleasure because she felt as though she did not deserve such happiness.\\n\\n\r\nKizuna (obviously) helps her to overcome her feelings of guilt, and, when she defeats the evil dragon (with her Immoral Weapon obtained through the stronger Climax Hybrid), she beats the past that has plagued her for far too long. Afterwards, Himekawa does not gain more attention, but it was nice to see her win.\\n\\n\r\nYurishia hails from America. With long blonde hair, a noticeable accent, and a princess-like aura about her, the other girls of the school flock to her like sweet candy. She has an outgoing personality, taking over conversations with her confidence and feminine beauty.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kizuna saves her from certain death, she practically starts to throw herself at him. But, while on their date, she gets a bit more serious, thanking Kizuna for what he did and instilling in her the want to live life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, when an old teammate by the name of Scarlett shows up, it appears Yurishia is not as perfect as she was painted as. Possibly even evil. For Scarlett talks about how Yurishia left her team to perish, earning all the glory for herself.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it was simply a misunderstanding (explained through a visualization of her memories). Yurishia did not know that a terrible enemy awaited her friends; she sent them away to protect them. While she did take the glory, she also shouldered the hate, and, with a steamy threesome (involving Kizuna), the two mend their relationship in full.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, for Himekawa and Yurishia, the anime provides nothing extensive. But at least Gakuen tried to give more beyond their sexual aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, their traits are wonderful in that they contrast sharply with their own personalities. Aine is lonely, so exhibitionist situations arouse her. Himekawa is innocent, so some dirty play gets her off. And Yurishia is dominant, so she responds immediately to submissive advances.\\n\\n\r\nConnected to them all, and indulging in the pleasures just as much, Kizuna rounds out the group. Yes, he\u2019s the everyman, given the one-of-kind, sex-empowering Hybrid Gear that permits him to almost-copulate with a bunch of beautiful women. But he has his problems, too. Mostly of the mommy variety.\\n\\n\r\nGrowing up, Kizuna did not have the best childhood. One of the very first scenes shown is how his mother literally disowns him because he is, to her, no longer useful. Gakuen does not go into much depth with his background, though, so it does not have weight to it.\\n\\n\r\nHe at least has his older sister who looks out for him, the Amaterasu group that supports him, and the gear that allows him to channel the power of those three girls. He\u2019s not powerful like them, and he isn\u2019t some dubious lecher. Rather, he\u2019s simply a guy doing his best to lead and to help those he loves.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, his mother\u2019s reappearance, working for the enemy, confuses Kizuna. And, when she continues to view people as little else but test subjects and uses them as such, Kizuna flies into a rage. She is the same now as she was back then, and that realization infuriates him.\\n\\n\r\nHis mother escapes, meaning his conflict does not see a satisfying resolution. Still, Aine, Himekawa, and Yurishia are at least explored to some extent throughout the season, giving the show a much needed boost in execution.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Gakuen both soothes and burns the eyes. In much the same way, the music caresses and grates the ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track has this science-fiction beat to it that\u2019s odd to listen to. Yet the anime pulls it off with mixing up the pacing, a kissing sound-effect, and, at times, a catchy tune. The final \u201couji-sama\u201d lyric does not fit within the structure of the song itself, but the slight harmonizing and the inclusion of piano keys keeps the song afloat.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the opening track is a lot worse off. Instruments that sound like broken trumpets, a somewhat upbeat tone that does not fit the atmosphere of the anime, and a bout of vocals that do not reach anywhere lofty. Altogether, it feels more like a mandatory inclusion rather than a piece designed for Gakuen.\\n\\n\r\nBut the original soundtrack ends up at the bottom. It has violin pieces for those sad moments and acoustic guitar ones for when things get frisky. But, like the OP, they do not impress. In fact, one track, sometimes used when the characters change into their Heart Hybrid Gear, sounds as though a ragtag rock band were playing from their garage in some random suburb. Its willy-nilly guitar and happier tone do not fit the seriousness of their transformations whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the girls moan in ecstasy during their sexual scenes (as does Kizuna during his transformation sequence near the end of the season), no notable voice acting performances were had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI cannot lie and say I wasn\u2019t aroused by this one. The lesbian scene between Grabel and Aldea was particularly steamy. And, admittedly, the show contains a fetish that I myself quite like. (As for which one that is, though, that\u2019ll be up for you, the reader, to decide.)\\n\\n\r\nI did like Himekawa and Aine as well. They were cute characters that took part in the romantic moments that I adore so much. Yurishia wasn\u2019t as fun to me due to her overly clingy behavior. In fact, I actually liked Scarlett (her friend) a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime did not hold up. Bland action sequences, drama that never made me emotional, and most of the sexual content were just gaps that separated the small scenes that I found likable. Also, it didn\u2019t help that Himekawa was somewhat ignored after her arc in the middle of the season.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, based off other websites and the ending of the first season, this one will be getting a sequel. But, given what I got here, I don\u2019t find myself checking it out anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nMasou Gakuen HxH prioritizes sex over almost anything else. It has some passable character writing, but with a weak plot, shoddy art, and music that does not fit, there\u2019s just not enough going for it to justify sitting through these negatives. If one needs porn, spanks and eights are a much better alternative.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, all about the sex, but, even then, those scenes have a handful of faults worth noting\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, wonky, laughable, disgusting, and disappointing, but at least the sex scenes are animated well enough\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Aine, Himekawa, and Yurishia are given passable conflicts to experience or overcome, and their contrasting sexual qualities up their original foundation\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, bad OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, some arousal here and there but most of the material simply lacks appeal\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "If you're worried about spoilers, ease up, you won't find any here.\r\nStory: 6/10 - The story was where I felt was weak point of the show, robot aliens that come from another dimension want to takeover the earth blah blah blah, humans make artificial islands to live on blah blah blah- you know where I'm going with this.\r\nArt & Sound: 9/10 -(I'm putting these two together because I gave them the same rating and it saves time)- The art and sound (in my opinion) are good, the CG was great for the most part, the action sequences and fight choreography were also well done, thecharacters and there armor designs were also pleasant. The vocals and music composition could be heard clearly even with my cheap lousy headphones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 - The characters themselves were... odd? I guess? There was not a lot of development for most of them and most didn't have enough of an impression to be memorable. Most of them were just generic and bland (okay you have PTSD about a past mistake, wow its not like I've seen that anywhere before). To be honest I only remember Aine, Kizuna and Sylvia only because they had the most growth, and Sylvia was the comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - All in all the show was very good, despite all my criticism, I really liked it. Most say it was terrible and gave it a low rating, I see where they're coming from, they have refined tastes and that can get in the way of fun aspects. This is an anime that is made for the enjoyment of action and sexual appeal and you can also get a genuine laugh more often then not, it has little concern for a deep story line (Although a little character development would be appreciated... Just saying) and *clears throat* \"creative\" designs. If you enjoy it, props to you if you don't, props to you. You have your opinion and I have mine.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for this review, thank you for reading :)",

            "content": "I decided to review the anime after seeing a lot of reviews where people got offended.\r\nLong story short.... it is ecchi anime with \"ecchi\" element pushed to the limit where it somehow doesn't yet become hentai. It is similar to Queen's Blade and Valkyrie Drive. Meaning nudity and erotic content. Aside from that focus on ecchi content, it is mediocre/average or *slightly* below that in quality. I've seen completely tame titles that were significantly worse than this. Detailed breakdown below. \r\nStory:\r\nThere's a story, and actually it would be great if some of the things got better explained. Humanity is at war, with, well, \"someone\". Fewevents unfold explaining who that \"someone\" is, but don't explain too much. The anime occasionally tries to play comedy angle, but it is handled rather awkwardly. There are usually two ecchi scenes per episode, meaning there's plenty of non-ecchi content inbetween that explains characters, their backgrounds, etc. Some of those scenes are handled very well, but some are pointless.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt is okay. It is a modern style with triangular faces and decent amount of detail. Main character somehow has completely non-memorable appearance. There's some cg which is noticeable, but it is not too horrible. Overall I've seen worse detailed characters, and it is surprising that in a few scenes where there are crowds of people in background, they drew everyone. Still... the anime resorts to time-saving tricks with \"panning and talking\" on occasion, although those are handled well. Aside from that animation is quite fluid, when it needs it. Heck, Youjo Senki looked much worse than this.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDoes its job. There was one theme that caught my attention, but it was cut short when I started listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThey're mostly stereotypes, although not too horrible ones. Main character is not believable, because ... well, at least he is not a wimp in glasses, but I'm pretty sure he is a robot - based on the way he approaches girls. His sister is apparently supposed to be a comedy character, but it didn't fly well. Characters change with time, slightly.... basically, they're not cartoon cutouts, and have some personality to them, but they're very stereotypical.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt is passable. I'd rather prefer to have a new season of To Love Ru. Basically, it has a bit too heavy focus on erotic content, and not enough comedy in it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe main reason to watch it if you want anime with erotic or \"heavy\" ecchi content that has non-idiotic story in it and is not hentai. If nudity and erotic content doesn't enrage you, it is an average/mediocre anime, and I think I could name bunch of titles I watched which were worse in quality than this despite being tame. If nudity/erotic content offends you, skip. It is not outstanding, better than valkyrie drive and worse than queen's blade. Tamer content woudl be Sekirei, Kempfer, and High School DxD.",

            "content": "Strong ecchi or a weak hentai? These thoughts were in my head when the Heart Hybrid scenes were occuring. If you are a fan of any ecchi anime and just want to see some nudity with a barely hentai scenes - watch it. If you like ecchi anime but the ones with actual story and memorable characters and nudity and jokes about them - it's not a show for you.\r\nI'm a fan of harem ecchi comedy anime since I watched Highschool DxD and I was looking up for a show like it, as H DxD was perfect for me and thats why HxH in thename caught my attention. Althought it feel like this show is a mix of few harem animes like Infinite Stratos, DxD or Maou no Testament and don't really feel too original. I kept watching it as I thought that it have potential to get better, and episodes 7,8, 11 and 12 confirmed it for me,  it even had a quite interesting cliff hanger at the end. But throught the show enjoyment of watching it was having its ups and downs. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of destroyed world, conquered by an alien invader, and the last standing girls soldiers fighting by using armors, powered by forbidden love of the only male soldier, did sound interesting. But the characters, althought each had unique personality, were too annoying for me with not a really good characters development. I was looking for either comedy or really dramatic moments in the series to make it somehow more memorising and interesting, but the dialogues, motives and interaction between characters were rather shallow. The protagonist wasn't really charismatic, and that's what a real HAREM KING should be (learn from Issei Hyoudou, Kizuna Hida!). Art and animation were on a good level and opening was pleasant to the ear, but it didn't really have an OST that I would be listening to in my free time just for a pleasure like I do with ones from some series. When the season 2 comes out I will check the first episode if it will keep the level of the last episode, but I don't have too much expectations for this series.\\n\\n",

If you know that, you probably know Isla. If your going to examine Aine and Isla, there is a huge comparison. Seriously, needs more originality please. The character development is still a no no. Just like any harems, It doesn't really have a good character development\r\nIn terms of Story or plot,Try watching  some numerous harem anime. Try to differentiate the conclusion of it all.",

The story of a boy who comes to a new school and gets to be liked by all the cute girls of the school has already been seen a lot especially a fighting school. The fact that the charater has to do something lewd with the heroines is specisl, but I think that it doesn't add something that interesting to the series. The animation is good, but not extraordinary, such as the sound. The charactersare the weakest point of the series, because they are not original at all. They all follow a stereotype of character from a harem series. We can almost guess what's going to be their reaction to some situations.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to people who like Harem/Ecchi anime, otherwise, you won't like this series a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I gave this series a 5/10 grade.",

            "content": "Ok so let me start with one thing, This anime has too much cliche, fanservice, character similiarity, and else. Nothing's unique, nothing good, only seeling girls, sex, porn, and else.\r\nMany people that say, this anime tries to compete themselves against Highschool DxD Series, neither LN or the anime....\r\nIMO, they lose in everything except in terms of ecchiness... This anime has a bad plot, art, character, and have A PRETTY DULL animation...\r\nTalking to the plot, this anime has a same plot as IS, Saijaku, Gakusen, and Hundred... \r\nA male that the only user of a power in that anime who gets attention from so many girls?Hey, that's a cliche!\\n\\n\r\nAnd, he's the only girls' saviour? Isn't that bad? What the ****?! Did they get drunk when making this anime? Or they have a low budget?!\\n\\n\r\n24 minutes only for a same plot? Hey, DAX, Flying Dog, GIVE ME BACK MY F****** 24 MINUTES!\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Highschool DxD still way much better than this anime... Why? DxD is pretty logical in terms of plot, while I don't find any plot-logic in this anime, which destroys the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's move Character, actually, many haracters that have a cliche, for me the only acceptable cliche is only oppais, young agers, and lolis. While this anime has many other cliche, a gentlemen MC that forced/labeled to be a perverted person, A princess Aplha-Girl, A naughty blonde girl, A power-seeking girl, A black-haired tsundere that came from a disciplinary council. \\n\\n\r\nBut, at least, Hida Kizuna still much better than Orimura Ichika who loves to hide to his harem...\\n\\n\r\nHello~ Even I someone who found Orimura Ichika(Infinite Stratos), Isla(Plastic Memories), and Claudia Enfield(Gakusen Toshi) in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the harem progression isn't logical at all and it's pretty easy to be destroyed...\\n\\n\r\nMoving to the art and animation, this anime only serve a mediocre art and A F******* S*** animation, not impresive at all.\\n\\n\r\nDxD still serve better animation than this... \\n\\n\r\nSound, Okay, the only one that I like from this anime is only the OST which came from Iori Nomizu(both of OPs and EDs), I kinda enjoy the song. But, else than that, this animedoesn't give any credit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Well... I DON'T ENJOY THIS ANIME AT ALL! If you're a pervert, okay, you'll still enjoy this anime. But, for a plot-seeking person? Nope.... I'm sorry, DAX, but it's the reality that you guys failed.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the worst of the season, year, and far worse from the previous worst anime(Musaigen no Phantom World) and this anime doesn't succeed on beating DxD in many ways or more. \\n\\n\r\nI would not want to watch this anime twice... And, I completely speechless for this anime\\n\\n\r\nThat's all",

A 3 Episode Drop Review. \r\nNow as I was unable to fathom or even watch this show to it's end, I might as well tell you why.\r\nGetting this over with is my number one priority.\r\n[Story] 2/10 - How...how...how...this would be a 1/10 if it didn't establish an enemy. The plot is so ungodly simple that it hurts. Honestly the synopsis makes it sound so much better. \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" applies to the plot so well. Let's sum up what I gathered from thefirst 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Monsters attack and Guy gropes girl with consent and it makes her stronger\\n\r\nEpsioed 2: Monsters attack and Guy gropes girl with consent and it makes her stronger\\n\r\nEpisode 3: Monsters attack and Guy gropes girl with consent and it makes her stronger\\n\\n\r\nLike really?!\\n\r\n\"Why are you criticizing an ecchi show for having now plot?!\" \\n\r\nJust because it's ecchi doesn't give it the excuse to have awful story and characters.\\n\r\nKill La Kill is ecchi and it has a flipping plot!\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 7/10 - I live by a motto \"Give credit where credit is due\" the art style is nice. Character design is alright, I was more interested in the monster design and the backgrounds than the character design though. It didn't hurt to look at, it wasn't awful. The best thing I can say about it is that it's good. That's it! The animation hurt this score quiet a bit too! It's not always fluent and it seems like all of the animation was dumped, DUMPED! Into the groping scenes. Yet again not a very good choice...\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 7/10 - Credit where credit is due. The OP and ED didn't make me want to rip my ears off which was nice. The music choices for scenes was pretty good, nothing to write home about though. Movements and voices sound like they should, though it feels as if the voice actors kinda phones in their performance during some scenes.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 1/10 - I don't think I've seen a show that handles characters this horribly. They introduce literally all of the characters in the first episode. I can sum up the characters right now too.\\n\\n\r\nMC Guy - Yeah Im calling him that, cause none of these characters names mean anything if they are all the same. You can basically call this guy the cliche womanizing black haired ladies man who is OPAF. \\n\\n\r\nGirl with Black Hair -  Boobs... that's it.\\n\\n\r\nGirl with Blonde Hair - Boobs... that's it.\\n\\n\r\nGirl with sliver/white Hair - Boobs... that's it.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot fathom! I CANNOT FATHOM! How this was made! There is no character development, no backstory, no nothing! It's so bland that I had to go stare a paint dry to get my blood pumping again. (The paint's color was blue and it was nice)\\n\r\nPhysical pain can be felt when watching these characters move or talk. It hurts so much that I had to take breaks to yet again look at the wall that it's paint had already finished drying on. (This wall was also blue!)\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 2/10 - I remember staring at blobs moving on the screen. Going cross eyed at least 20 times, forcing me to snap back into reality. I hate this show, so much. Boring and unending agonizing pain really hurt.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 3/10 - All of the score comes from the art and sound, which is sad. No plot, no character, lots of boobs. Ecchi ecchi ecchi, boobs boobs boobs. Good lord, can I be done now? Can I go home now? Please?!",
