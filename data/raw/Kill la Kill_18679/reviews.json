            "content": "It's been said by many veteran anime watchers that anime is dying. In the old days we had our Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Wolf's Rain, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Akira, FLCL, Berserk, Fist of the North Star, and Miyazaki; we had Space Captain Harlock, Lupin the Third, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Ghost in the Shell. Even if you haven't seen these, you've likely at least heard of them and the impact that they've had on anime as a whole. Anime was an intellectual, creative medium that reflected flair and pizzazz. It wasn't just silly entertainment for kids, like many Western cartoons, and people of all ages couldenjoy it. As of late it seems that anime has been stuck in a rut of moe, harems, rom-coms with unrealistically dense male MC\u2019s, and onii-chan/imouto obsessive garbage. Lately there's been a lack of courage to sack up, step outside of the box, and say, \"Hey, let's try something new.\" After you peruse season after season of the same regurgitated genres you might find yourself wondering if anime has lost its way... And, to answer that question, Trigger will look down and whisper, \"No.\" \\n\\n\r\nWatching the story of Kill la Kill unfold was confusing, exhilarating, comical, lively, and goddamn refreshing. What began as a simple revenge story, with a shaky plot direction, overabundance of fan-service, and obnoxiously flashy fight scenes, ended in a surprisingly competent and satisfying fashion. Although Kill la Kill is entertaining, it is still a series that prioritizes style more than substance. This isn\u2019t to say that the series is shallow in the slightest, but it\u2019s often difficult to overlook the abundance of panty shots, suffocatingly tight and revealing outfits, the FLCL-esque action, and all their allure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a lot of wild enjoyment to be had in Kill la Kill, it's also easy to disregard what makes this series so brilliant. Part of the genius behind Kill la Kill is the fact that the show itself is a parody of many overused tropes in recent anime. Over-sexualized, provocative clothing and fan-service for no reason? Check. Student council is overpowered? Check. School system that emphasizes uniforms? Check. Story about revenge? Also check. Not only does the series poke fun at commonalities in anime, it also fires shots at the oppressive nature of the Japanese education system. The most astounding part about all of this is that Kill la Kill doesn't just adhere to the common tropes itself for shits and giggles; it actually takes these tropes and literally makes them its plot. Even if you don't take the stance on viewing the series as a parody, you'd probably still find the series entertaining and fun to watch on a different standard. That's ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen. \\n\\n\r\nTrigger did something interesting with its characters in Kill la Kill that you don\u2019t see in anime too often, adding to the fresh factor of the show.  They took a series that banks on testosterone-based, over-the-top action and made the main characters girls. It's not often that you come across an anime with a strong female lead that can not only stand up for herself, but also against tyranny and male counter parts. Ryuuko personifies these values. There\u2019s a struggle within our current modern-day society to fit in with social norms. It\u2019s tough to be that black sheep individual that goes about their own business without being judged by the majority, hence why we generally follow fashion trends, region-specific social etiquette, and so forth. The growth of Ryuuko reflects this as the development of her character is steadily shown across the span of the series. Ryuuko starts off as a bland teenage girl with attitude looking for retribution against the one who killed her father. When introduced to Senketsu \u2014 a revealing sailor uniform made of life fibers \u2014 she is submitted to humility in exchange for power. It\u2019s things like this that should make you raise an eyebrow and wonder whether or not this is reflective of the advantages and disadvantages that sexuality offers women. Maybe I\u2019m looking too much into it, or maybe I\u2019m right. What\u2019s great about Kill la Kill is that there isn't a right answer. You take from it what you want. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Ryuuko portrays big themes and intricate lessons woven into her character, it would be a crime to disregard the rest of the cast of the series. The character body of Kill la Kill is quite diverse and there are plenty of likable characters. Each character brings something to the table in terms of entertainment and, as a whole, makes sure that there\u2019s never a dull moment. Characters that are depicted as the antagonists, such as Satsuki and the Four Devas, are likeable. Mako, who is essentially the fool, is actually funny. The way these characters fit the mold of wacky, but wacky with personality, is astounding. Characters feel like they fit into the show seamlessly and that can be hard to come by. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is similar to the chaotic, yet extremely fun style that Gainax offered in both FLCL and TTGL. It\u2019s hard to ignore the resemblance when Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Ohtsuka, originally from Gainax, are now a part of Studio Trigger. The action defies logic and physics, the art is stellar, the animation is fluid, the backdrops are majestic, and all of it meshes together nicely. The sound criteria of Kill la Kill is also quite exceptional itself. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s are good, the OST is great, and the voice acting is on point. There\u2019s nothing else to ask for. With that being said, I think the biggest problem is that Trigger has with Kill la Kill is that while retaining the style, they also retained dips in the quality of the art and animation, similar to those in TTGL. There's a lot of repeated animated scenes, such as the Kamui change scene, the shot of the heel clicking the ground, and even sword swinging. It\u2019s not horrible or extremely detrimental to enjoyment, but it is there. The animation drops for a series as chaotic as Kill la Kill is understandable, given that Studio Trigger is also very new, and so I\u2019d take this fault with a grain of salt. \\n\\n\r\nFor Studio Trigger\u2019s first original, seasonal anime series, Kill la Kill came in and went out with a bang. While it doesn't quite hit the status of masterpiece, I\u2019ve been made a fan. I will be looking forward to whatever creativity their future works will bring.",

            "content": "Welcome to Kill la Kill. This is where fanservice is plot, style is substance and every episode plays out like the finale. This is anime.\r\nFrom the makers of FLCL, Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking, Kill la Kill is the first television production series under the newly formed Studio Trigger. Its is a tale of a transfer student, Matoi Ryuuko, wielding a scissor-sword, comes to Honnouji Academy to look for her father's killer. Opposing her is the Student Council President, Kiryin Satsuki, as well as her personal guard of the Elite Four, who are developing uniforms of immense power. After an initial fight, where Ryuukoends up being defeated, she stumbles across a sailor uniform that gives her the power to overcome her enemies and give her the answers that she seeks. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill takes all the worn-out tropes and clich\u00e9s of anime, amps it up to eleven and then delightfully invert them to give something exciting and fresh. While Ryuuko's tale of revenge is a tad predictable, it is the execution of the plot points that makes it stand out from its peers. Everything is exaggerated to the extreme including the school setting, characters, concepts to the absolutely epic action that happens. The show makes a point of never dwelling on a single event for too long and continually ups the ante in every single episode. There is little filler and the show is pretty subversive by playing with the viewer's expectations and then completely changing the outcome. When the action does slows down, there is a metric ton of references and homage to western culture ranging from Marvel Comics to classical music and literature. At the same time, Kill la Kill is mindful of its own Japanese heritage and folklore, drawing parallels to Oba Nobunaga, anime of old and new while not overly heavy-handed with its references by keeping it quick and tucked away in the background. Some elements of comedy are thrown in, complete with visual gags, puns and slapstick humor. However, a point of contention is the hit and miss nature of Mako's antics, which may not go well with every viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOn a first glance, Kill la Kill's visuals is reminiscent of cell animation at its peak during the late 1990s with its warm color palette and strong outlines. The backgrounds are drawn to the style of oil paintings and provide a epic and cinematic feel to the show instead of the drab outlines that other shows often present. In the animation department, Studio Trigger takes every possible shortcut in producing this show by utilizing extended single frames, sometimes even coming down to Inferno Cop levels. However, the style and energy placed into the visuals, more than make up for it technical shortcomings. Studio Trigger knows that this is an anime and plays around with that fact by slapping GIANT RED TEXT on everything and breaking the fourth wall constantly through changing perspectives and character proportions. Everything is presented with the force of a runaway freight train and doesn't let up until the viewer either gives in or walks away. The animation quality sometimes does take a nose dive that is too steep to ignore (Episode 4) with repetitive sequences, sloppy frames and limited motion. As well, the hilariously bad CGI in some places (I'm looking at you Episode 3), is enough to break the viewer's immersion. That being said, I applause the production team for making Kill la Kill never having a dull moment onscreen and being innovative with such a limited budget.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the explosive theatrics that is plastered all over the screen, the characters are outstanding in the way they inject themselves into the show and overarching plotline. Ryuuko's tomboyish behavior, recklessness and imaginative fighting tactics solidifies her as one of the strongest female leads I've seen in recent years. At the same time, she does get embarrassed my her scandalous-looking outfit and is vulnerable due to her past of growing up as a delinquent loner, making her feel like more of a teenager being thrown into absurd situations and less than any pre-established archetypes of a typical shouen show. Her nemesis and my personal favorite, K Satsuki, is the student council president who runs Honnouji Academy like a fascist regime and literally radiates power. Although she is on par with Ryuuko's combat power, Satsuki prefers to use her various schemes and henchmen to do her dirty work and knows more than she lets on. Bolstering the two already formidable leads, the supporting characters are very memorable in their own right with the Elite Four, the eccentric Mako, the nudist stripping homeroom teacher, and various factions duking it out. Each characters adds their own brand of wackiness into an anime that doesn't holds anything back.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (of Attack on Titan and Blue Exorcist fame) is outstanding in every aspect and holds up the show when the animation decides to takes a break. By combining genres ranging from rock, electronica, vocals, jazz and bass, Sawano creates a score that is distinctive, addictive, energetic and flows perfectly with the over-the-top nature of Kill la Kill. Some standouts includes the rock-oriented 'Before my body is dry', 'Blumenkranz ', and the disturbingly haunting theme of Harime Nui. The character voices is equally as strong as the soundtrack with Ami (Code Geass's Kallen Stadtfeld and Spice and Wolf's Holo) portraying the hot-blooded and bash Ryuuko, Yuzuki Ryouka (Air's Minagi ) as the totalitarian Satsuki and the relatively new Suzaki Aya as Mako. Opposing the main leads, Paku, Romi adds an edge of as the sadistic Kiryuuin Ragyou and Tamura Yukari (Higurashi's Rika) as the batshit-crazy psycho Harime Nui. Male leads are also excellent with their respective VAs doing exceptional work on voicing Sanageyama, Gamagoori, and the fabulous Mikisugi.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the primary draw of Kill la Kill is the sheer ludicrousy of action that happens, there is a good amount of depth in terms of the themes nudity, clothing and sexuality. The amount of nudity and fanservice shown in Kill la Kill far exceeds any typical anime, showing off asses, breasts and glowing nipples left, right and center. In fact, Ryuuko's skimpy uniform only gets more powerful when the user shreds her shame and embraces her naked self. However, more often than not, the exaggerated use of fanservice is sometime more along the lines being a parody rather than anything sexual or pandering to the audience. While other shows uses sexiness to pour gravy over the main course of the plot and characters, the nudity is interwoven into the narrative and provides context for analysis and discussion. And this is where the beauty of Studio Trigger's masterpiece lies, where it can appeals to the causal action-oriented viewer by giving them a rollercoaster ride on afterburners while layering the show for analysis and discussion for the more savvy anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nFor its first production work, it feels that this is the culmination of Studio Trigger's legacy by combining the energy and randomness of FLCL, the over-the-top nature and scale of Gurren Lagann, and sexualized content of Panty and Stocking into something very unique and very deserving of all the hype that it is given.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nTL DR:\\n\r\nSimplistic plot but perfect execution \\n\r\nCharacters that you can't help but cheer for\\n\r\nAwesome animation for such a small budget\\n\r\nCan be as shallow or deep depending on what the viewer wants the show to be\\n\r\nHigh rewatchability \\n\r\nGo watch and judge for yourself. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Witnessing the Kill la Kill hype train chugging along made me enter the show with negative expectations. The generic revenge plot, school setting and ridiculous designs left me folding my arms and rolling my eyes. It was and still is boldly proclaimed that Trigger is 'saving anime', whatever that means, but while Kill la Kill may be refreshing, is it really a cut above the rest? For better or worse, I could not help but feeling vindicated for holding my initial expectations. With the closing of the last episode, I felt I had just watched a slideshow rather than an engaging narrative.It should be stated that having a show that doesn't revolve around the banality of the fantastical construct that is 'moe' is heartening. Perhaps a narrative of personal struggle, coupled with great conflict and violence is rather cliche, but it is certainly more entertaining. Ryuuko as a character is interesting in that she isn't a flower that immediately wavers in the face of adversity or isn't immediately 'put in place' by a man. Unfortunately, that is basically all she has going for her, otherwise she is just another angst ridden teenager with a chip on her shoulder. Sure, Kill la Kill is indeed a show that not only has a strong female lead, but is dominated by powerful women, however that alone does not warrant high praise. Trigger talked of 'taking risks' but it seems Ryuuko is purposely not fleshed out to be broadly appealing. Her anger, loneliness and eventual commitment to her friends is something shared with many protagonists. \\n\\n\r\n The narrative as a whole leaves something to be desired. From episode 3 it was obvious that they couldn't draw out Ryuuko and Satsuki's clashing of heads for a whole 24 episodes. The show already heavily alludes to Satsuki as being more than what she projects. Given that this is a Japanese narrative, it is based on kish\u014dtenketsu and the plot is hinged on a twist. You think with narrative structure based on plot twists, you would go for something interesting. However, Trigger in their infinite wisdom decided to go with the generic 'I am your father' twist. While it was honestly unexpected on my part, it was still wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\n Besides that, there are jarring transitions between a more light-hearted action/comedy to more serious action/drama. I honestly fail to see why Trigger thought Mako and her family were absolutely indispensable for the narrative. While the show is already over the top, ramming in the crass antics of the Mankanshoku family amid conflict with wide reaching ramifications is on the level of Michael Bay's Transformers. What purpose does Mako even serve other than that of a pure plot device? She is that of a generic best friend character who's only defining trait are her long winded motivational rants. Her relationship with Ryuuko is an implied one, they are forced together in episode one with absolutely no development what so ever. \\n\\n\r\n Kill la Kill relies heavily on it's stylistic elements, so good action should be among one of it's hallmarks. Despite that, the quality of the fight scenes are underwhelming, as they are dependent on speed lines and characters shouting at one another. It could be said that in Kill la Kill the characters fight first and foremost with words, fists and weapons being secondary arms. While I understand that aesthetics are a matter of subjectivity, I can't leave out my conviction that most of the designs are just plain terrible. It seems all they did was take the standard Japanese school uniform and added as many spikes and stars as humanly possible. If the transformations aren't hulking masses of arbitrary geometry, than they are merely skimpy shoe laces with bulging shoulders. All in all, I can't praise Kill la Kill to high heaven, but I can't exactly hate it either. It's OST is remarkable and really propels the show where it is lacking, even if I cannot appreciate all the tracks. That said, if this is what constitutes 'saving anime', then we are truly screwed, this should be among the average, not the exceptional. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: I don't agree with half the stuff I said in this review and I think my writing style is quite immature and undeveloped, but the community got a kick out of it, so I'll leave it here.\r\nKill la Kill has been praised as hilarious satire of action anime, but it ultimately fails to communicate to the watcher that it is satire by attempting to include profound thought amidst a spectacular display of skin and stupidity.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhen I saw Ryouku Matoi arriving at Honnouji Academy with half of a scissor to discover who killed her father, I'll admit that I was excited by the premiseof this show.  However, the plot for the first third of the show was repetitive and dull, and felt like 8 episodes of filler.  Then, Ryouku finally made her way to battle the woman she had been seeking, lost, and the show proceeded into an arc revolving around the concept that high schools have more authority in Japan.  While the dialogue is witty, the events are poorly written and crappily explained, and most of the time, one isn't even sure why the characters fight.  \\n\r\nNow, the show's elaborate screaming fight scenes would be okay if it was satire, as most deem it to be, but Kill La Kill leads you to believe that it's taking itself seriously.  There are dull conversations about how clothing somehow became sentient (huh?) and that it corrupts the human race (the explanation for how it corrupts humans is so shitty and half-assed i didn't bother trying to understand it.)\\n\r\nUltimately, I would accept the story as satire if it didn't try to be ridiculous, non-sensical, and philosophical/intelligent all at once.\\n\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\nWhile the fighting animation of the show is fluid and exciting, the environments are undeveloped and rely upon a dull color palette.  On top of that, the characters look like they are still sketches, filled with haphazard lines and only a few bright colors.  It's hard to tell the difference between Ira Gamagori and the desert with two buildings(half of the show's setting) behind him.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nKill la Kill features catchy openings, closings, and a  stellar fight theme in \"Before my Body is Dry,\" but \"Before my Body is Dry\" is the only song that the show ever plays.  The lack of variety is pretty sad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI'm not sure whether to give Characters a \"2\" or a \"10.\" Honestly, they're ridiculous and poorly developed (they remain pretty stagnant throughout all 24 episodes, except for Ryouku.)  This lack of development is fine if this is satire of action anime, but KLK still attempts to make a point about malicious clothing and human shame, so the one quality that could have made ridiculous characters and lack of development for everyone but Ryouku is perfectly fine is made null by the show's ardent desire for us to take it seriously by adding in more bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nMost jokes are pretty funny, and Mako Mankashouka is utterly hilarious, while Guts is pretty cool, too.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict: 5/10\\n\r\nAs long as you don't go into Kill la Kill expecting it to have legitimate, intellectual weight and commentary, you'll find a show that is pretty funny, and Ryouku's pretty hot.  It's a shame Kill la Kill couldn't decide if it wanted to be satire or serious.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nForgive me God of all Weaboos for I have sinned. I didn't enjoy Kill La Kill. Actually, it's worse than that. I fucking HATED Kill La Kill! It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, it wasn't a \"brilliant satire\". The animation was decent as befits a modern series with a huge budget, but nothing else was worthy of praise, let alone the amount of sheer adoration this series gets. Many people may disagree with this assessment, but I will explain.\r\nFirstly, I would like to clear something up that has been bothering me. My fellow Americans frequently use the word \"satire\" incorrectly, to the point that Iam convinced most people don't actually understand what it means anymore. There are several forms of classic satire, but the most common is probably still the Juvenalian satire created by the Roman writer Juvenal. The point of this style of satire is to write in a voice that the author actually opposes and comically highlight everything wrong with the position that the voice is supposedly arguing in favor of. A well known contemporary example would be Stephen Colbert's faux conservative character from the Colbert Report. In the next paragraph, I will show an example of what an actually \"brilliant satire\" looks like.\\n\\n\r\nIf Kill La Kill isn't what I consider a great satire then what the hell is? What does one look like? A good example of a truly brilliant and hilarious satire would be the novel Dead Souls. The novel was written to viciously mock the callous cruelty, uncaring nature, and disgusting greed of the upper class. Our \"hero\" is an immoral asshole who wishes to get rich using a profoundly ridiculous and darkly hilarious plan. The novel was written when slavery was still legal, and during that time period the law plainly stated that slaves counted only as property and not as people. Our hero figures out that therefore slaves could legally be purchased and sold after death because legally property doesn't suddenly cease being property. The concept of a sales catalog and people buying products without ever seeing them was brand new at the time and gives our hero a wonderful idea. He could legally buy hundreds of dead slaves for pennies and sell them (sight unseen) for about 10 dollars each to wealthy land owners who would jump at the deal of buying lots of slaves at a discount price. Our hero insinuates that his \"discount slaves\" are women, children, and elderly and that is why they are so cheap. He allows his buyers to fill in the details without ever explicitly saying an untruth and therefore avoiding being sued for false advertisement. His buyers believe that they have ripped off our hero, only to get hundreds of corpses dumped on their lawns. Every character including our \"hero\" is portrayed in an extremely negative manner and thus readers are encouraged to laugh our asses off at the slavers getting royally ripped off. The fact that the entire plan would have been completely legal at the time the novel was written only made it funnier. The author is pointing out to his  readers that they lived in a society where something that ghastly and morally outrageous was legal and encouraging them to fight against slavery without ever having to explicitly say so. A true satire makes a bold stance against a position that is still popular with a large portion of society and highlights everything wrong with that position. Satires address large societal issues and try to use comedy to create real social change. A satire is NOT just a work that revels in its own stupidity in order to vaguely mock other stupid works that are universally considered to be stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so if Kill la Kill isn't technically satire then what is it? A work that tries to be really stupid and absurd in order to make fun of a genre is typically called a \"spoof\". Although less intellectually lofty than the satire, spoofs can still be great! Good examples would be the works of Mel Brooks like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which are quite rightly considered 2 of the greatest movies the United States has ever produced. Sadly, Hollywood never quite understood what made Mel Brook's movies so special and started shitting out truly awful spoofs: Mafia, Ricky 1 (a spoof of rocky), Scary Movie 1-5, Date Movie, Vampires Suck, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc. Enter Gainax, everyone's favorite insanely overrated anime studio to copy the Americans and produce their own low quality spoofs to cash in on this trend. We get \"great\" works like Kill La Kill and Panty and Stocking as a result! Hooray! Where does Kill La Kill rank on the hierarchy of spoofs? Slightly above the movies of Seltzer and Friedberg, but not quite as good as The Lucas Bros Moving Company.\\n\\n\r\nWe all know Shonen anime has REALLY stupid cliches, objectifies women, and has head bashingly retarded plot holes. Making a show that takes all that EVERYONE already agrees sucks about anime and reveling in its own shittyness isn't very clever and isn't actually a great goal. Simply being self aware of your own stupidity doesn't make a show or movie good. Was Wild Wild West aware that having a giant spider robot and REALLY silly dialogue and action was stupid? YES! They were very aware that they were making a stupid movie that took all the cliches of summer blockbusters and turned them up to 11. Does that  make Wild Wild West a clever cinematic masterpiece? NO! No it doesn't! In the same way, Kill La Kill's self awareness doesn't save it from being a piece of shit anime!",

            "content": "It\u2019s not often I come across shows that I would consider an \u201cinstant classic,\u201d a term that is often thrown out by a lot of movie critics. There have been a lot of anime classics in recent memory that has proved to be worthy of the spotlight and have garnered intense admiration from both casual and hardcore fans. However, these past couple years have shown that the ones that do get a great deal of hype and attention during its inception are looked at with mostly skepticism as to whether they deserved all of it, to begin with. Then in the year 2013, out comesa show named Kill La Kill. A show that not only justified its hype but managed to break the mold for current trends that will make it unforgettable for years on end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know the history of how this project was done, it\u2019s quite an accomplishment, to say the least, for a little studio like Trigger. Being headed by the director, Hiroyuki Imaishi, a man who previously worked for Gainax and directed the other anime classics like Gurren Lagaan and Panty & Stocking, but later left in 2011 to form Trigger with co-director Masahiko Ohtsuka. Considering how Gainax has been doing as of late, this would probably be the smartest move any director would\u2019ve ever made. The studio had made a few production credits before Kill La Kill and had gained some exposure after making the short film Little Witch Academia. Finally, they made their first official anime series in Kill La Kill. Out of all of the debuts for anime studios, you couldn\u2019t have asked for a stellar first impression quite like this show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very opening of the first episode of Kill La Kill, we are now being shoved into a world that is chaotic and filled with disorder within the social classes of people. Not just from the actual story itself, but from the art style and animation that comes with them. Every single character is drawn with fluid clarity while at the same time very disorganized with a cartoonish aesthetic to it. These sorts of thematic set-pieces shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone who has seen Gurren Lagaan; at the same time, it can be argued that Kill La Kill is ten times wackier than Gurren Lagaan in terms of tone and art style. It\u2019s these two aspects about Hiroyuki that make him one of the top anime directors living today, in how he has this massive vision for spectacle. More often than not, he does not disappoint in any of the shows he\u2019s been at the helm of.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe the plot in the simplest terms, it\u2019s quite absurd, silly, anarchistic, and ridiculous in many areas. Many might see this as a negative at face value with the advent of gratuitous fanservice being thrown out left and right, the uneven pacing, and the alienating nature of how the story is told with hardly any context. Despite all of these aspects that might sound negative at first, upon closer speculation of the show as it goes along, all of them feel really proper to Kill La Kill\u2019s overall vision of how it portrays its story, characters, and art. All of them have the specific purpose of being the way they are, and they succeed in achieving the amount of charm and personality it incorporates with them that make them entertaining to watch and laugh at. Now, if it were animated in a traditional way like most anime shows, it wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been bad, but it just wouldn\u2019t accomplish nearly enough with the lack of coherency with the tone and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn critiquing the actual plot itself, it\u2019s not necessarily the most original that anime has come to expect. Your average revenge action shows that follows a linear narrative of a girl, named Ryuuko Matoi, with her sidekick, Mako Mankanshou, who she encounters early on in her revenge journey to kill the main villain of the show, Satsuki Kiryuuin. That shouldn\u2019t suggest that Kill La Kill needed to have a complicated story, to begin with. Everything else that makes the show work is its self-awareness of how nonsensical the action scenes are and the ridiculous amount of fanservice that would put most ecchi series to shame. As I\u2019ve described the show\u2019s plot as anarchistic before, I meant that in the sense of how the writers feel that they shot down the cliches that have plagued the vast majority of anime today and make them of their own accord that makes them unique to Kill La Kill. They are the same cliches, but they make it fresh by how they portray it in an old-school layout with the Japanese texts that pop up, which are reminiscent of anime from the \u201990s. As with Gurren Lagaan, Kill La Kill\u2019s grand finale proves to be worth the joyous ride thanks to some well-developed cliffhangers that add some exciting plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with plot, the characters that sprout up in Kill La Kill are no less than unforgettable from their personalities to their future growth as real characters. Individually, I\u2019d like to start with the main hero, Ryuuko Matoi. Her intentions are simple in layman\u2019s terms. However, her enthusiastic rage and determination written to her archetype are stellar. It\u2019s these two facets that make for an ingenious hero in an action shounen show with the enormous size and scope that Kill La Kill has. They make the hero engaging and attention-grabbing so we can empathize with her struggle to overcome any obstacle that gets in her way of achieving her goal, whatever the case may be. As the plot goes further, her growth is handled with great clarity and pacing. Her strength and courage become more vivid to see while she improves her well-being as a person after learning new information about who killed her father and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that deserves her spotlight is the lovable Mako. Probably the most eccentric out of all of the characters in Kill La Kill, although her entire family could be construed to that as well. The same way how Ryuuko is a fantastic character due to her charisma and attention-grabbing, Mako is like that but in a different angle. She\u2019s the comic relief for the show, and thanks to the tremendous snappy animation, her comedic antics that involve jumping on people affectionately to show her love for her friends and her attempts at trying to encourage Ryuuko to stay strong are all incredibly sincere and entertaining. Most of the charm that is apparent in the show come from Mako, and it\u2019s a great blessing that she\u2019s given a considerable amount of screen-time, which really gives her a lot of material to show forth.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish off the rest of the cast, our main villain Satsuki is about as charismatic and devoted to her goal as our main heroine, which is saying a lot. She has an extremely intimidating presence to her and likewise is always an excellent sign for a villain. Due to spoilers, I won\u2019t go further on how the other villains play out, but needless to say, they all fill out their roles just as well as Satsuki does. The male characters in the show all have the same type of charisma that made Mako great, with a similar comedic schtick that only differs slightly due to their genders. Another sidekick to Ryuuko is her own talking outfit Senketsu, whose amusing quips are pretty genuine and funny.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice has been the black sheep of anime for many people who generally can\u2019t get into it. Some may say that there\u2019s no such thing as an intelligent way of showcasing fanservice, but that\u2019s far from the truth. Sure, many examples do fail in doing so, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that fanservice can\u2019t be done positively; in which Kill La Kill may be the best example that we have. Allow me to explain. You have girls wearing very provocative clothing in this show that barely covers every part of their body that might seem like they are just portrayed as objects or characters just for the sake of sexual promiscuity. Bad fanservice like this is when girls are only represented as that and nothing else, but good fanservice is when the girls themselves control their sexuality and body that overshadows the potential scenario of becoming just an object of affection. When Ryuuko puts on the suggestive outfit, she still becomes a strong woman despite being portrayed in this lewd fashion and can become one with the gear, along with Satsuki. When you want fanservice to become intelligent, you need to realize the real strength of how girls can indeed become independent beings and still become strong characters, while pleasing the audiences\u2019 eyes as a bonus. If you don\u2019t even attempt in doing so, then you\u2019ve failed to gain any merit to the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nFor a while, there hasn\u2019t been much action anime that made me feel really excited to watch the actual action, due to how the animation in most of them doesn\u2019t really translate well with great flair and precision. Backed up with the animation of Kill La Kill, I found myself really engaged with the action in the show by how the art style of the characters and how they move really fluidly in the retro-looking animation. The way to do action right is to keep flowing with minimal interference while we listen to the characters thinking to themselves for almost a minute on how they\u2019ll get out of a particular situation. Not a dull moment passes by with the level of creativity that is given to Kill La Kill\u2019s animation, and the action sequences are just one of the few big reasons as to why this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nWith music being the main driving force of how action can be exciting. the main genre Kill La Kill focuses on is your typical guitar-driven orchestration that is influenced by many J-Rock acts as of late. The other thing that also gives the show its added camaraderie is the voice casting. Ryuuko being played by Ami Koshimizu is probably the most appropriate voice actress anybody could\u2019ve picked. I would even argue that this is Ami\u2019s best role that she has ever had in her career since Kallen from Code Geass. Another fantastic performance is by the up and coming star Aya Suzaki playing Mako. Her active voice fits perfectly with Mako\u2019s presence in the show, and the amount of enthusiasm she expresses through her lines that go on for quite a while in each episode is quite astounding.\\n\\n\r\nThe accomplishment of Kill La Kill\u2019s influence is something that will live on for as long as anime will continue to prosper. It\u2019s a show that does not care what its detractors say about it because it just doesn\u2019t have any rules or order to be found in its bones. Imaginative ideas are very hard to come by with any medium as of now, but that is to be accepted with how the economic climate is in Japan. Kill La Kill and how it was created by a young studio goes to show that these possibilities still exist and will continue to exist for however long this medium will live. Trigger studio has a lot to prove for whatever projects they\u2019re planning to do in the future, but with this as their first main series, that possibility is but only at arms reach.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A",

            "content": "So if you've read my Attack on Titan review, you know I'm not a fan of the hype but after hearing how similar Kill La Kill was to Gurren Lagann or something like Dead Leaves, I couldn't say no. Its been a while and I felt like my elitist brain could afford to be taken down a notch for a good 24 episodes; and it was heaven. It was like rewatching that show with swords and clothes instead of mechs and flashy lights. Honestly if you were thinking about rewatching Gurren Lagann anytime soon, I'd watch this because you're watching essentially the same show withsome differences, and you'll get the ADD tooth satisfied. But that also entails the fact that Kill La Kill suffers from downfalls that TTGL did, but sometimes to a worse degree.\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably have seen from everyone slapping their lips together on the internet Kill La Kill is all about style over substance and teases you with some plot every now and again. But for the meat and potatoes of the positive of the show; it's all about the action and the wonderfully flashy animation, and you really can't say much more about it. The other big perk of the show is the humor. It goes from being obnoxious and slapstick (in the vein of Looney Toons, seriously)to incredibly clever self aware jokes about what they're doing, what someone didn't need to repeat, or how bizarre Nudisto Beachu is is. And the show is so packed with attitude that you'll hear most of the characters shoot off a clever bout of screamed sarcasm most of the time. Dialogue and action are really the show's strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters themselves, while static and formulaic, are pretty great and are reminders of why I like shows like this so much. Ryuko is awesome to watch (and not because action requires her to be half naked), and the feeling I got from watching her struggle was similar to sitting down and listening to a favorite metal album at full volume after someone said something pants-on-head stupid at work. Lady Satsuki makes for a phenomenal villain (until the villain switch up I won't spoil that is) and plays well on the Yin to Ryuko's Yang of being a ruthless leader. The rest of the characters however might bring a gag (Mako) or a cool series of action sequences (the Elite Four) to the stage, but other than that they make the show work for the sake of being crazy and fun, but aren't in or are themselves very interesting. The villains and the powers of the characters is where the show started to slump a bit, as Kill La Kill is one of the shows that suffers from Egg of the King Syndrome (see my Black Butler review  and Berserk review when it comes out). When you find out certain characters just don't die, the weight of feeling the tension of their struggle disappears. And even after such death defying experiences I was sad to find that few characters really learned anything, especially after switching alliances from one side to the other. They just kinda change sides and now they're friends. Those who have watched at least halfway through the show know what I'm talking about. The other issue with them is it's difficult to see their relevance to the world they occupy. If they're in school, why are they going? It seems unlikely that so many of the students would go there and teachers teach there to become part of a larger plan. So characters are good but not great, and I dare you to look me in the eye and tell me Mikisugi isn't Kamina.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside of Kill La Kill is obviously where I have to get analytic otherwise writing reviews wouldn't be fun. It does have a plot, it's just that it's as not serious and nonsensical as TTGL's was and unfortunately was desperate to be taken seriously. The issue with Kill La Kill's plot is that not only is it the painfully predictable save the world from aliens that look weird story we've all seen a thousand times regardless on if you like anime or not. Another issue is that the plot is a royal little tease. It begins by referencing, and I kid you not, George Orwell's 1984, and at first I thought it would become a giant metaphor for facism with flashy action like what Fooly Cooly had created with puberty. However because the story will do 180 degree spin-kicks of introducing new plot elements and characters throughout paired with the fact that the story was predictable and corny had gotten my hopes down for a giant, deeper metaphor. It tries to go deep by making references and talking about mega-corporations using clothing to take over the world, but the end result of everything ending in a big sword-and-boob flinging match doused that flame pretty quick. As for the 180 degree turns...said sharp turns in the story such as introducing new villains or unveiling true intentions aren't really plot twists as much as they are frustrating. I spent time watching characters fight and win just to get a completely different story out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo you liked TTGL you'll like Kill La Kill. Kill La Kill I thought had better music too that only added to the attitude and the bigness of the show, and while the trade off of having better music and action, it still doesn't beat Gurren Lagann in quality, world-building, story and character building. It's fun to watch but doesn't live up to the hype.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes a show doesn't need to have the most coherent plot or a cast of sensible and realistic characters to succeed in entertaining its audience. These shows appeal to our emotions and excel at utilizing momentum and suspense to keep us watching and demanding more. While Kill La Kill doesn't bring us anything revolutionary or extraordinary in terms of plot development or character design, the manner in which Trigger presents and delivers the show in a way where you can't help but give it your full attention as you watch an episode. Through a mix of over-the-top fan service, exaggerated confrontations and battle scenes, ridiculousand nonsensical humor, all under an equally insane and, for lack of a better word, creative premise and plot, Kill La Kill brings us a show that, at the very least, will keep you entertained and amused throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Matoi Ryuuko, our fresh, fierce-looking transfer student at Honnouji Academy, where Kiryuuin Satsuki's word is law and your star rank represents your position in society. A girl on a mission to find her father's murderer, with only half of a giant red scissor blade as her clue, Ryuuko stops at nothing to seek the truth, even if it means toppling the very foundation of the Academy itself. She's not alone, however; the ever-energetic and friendly Mankanshoku Mako and her family serve as Ryuuko's beacon of support and source of the occasional pile of delicious croquettes. By fighting her way to the top of the Honnouji hierarchy with her trusted Kamui Senketsu, yet another memento of her late father, she may get the answers to her questions, and maybe, just maybe, something much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko's character development throughout the show was nothing stellar, yet at the same time I found myself becoming angry at the reckless situations she throws herself into, smiling silly at her goofy relationship with Mako, and cheering madly for her as she defeats numerous powerful adversaries. While the whole \"there's this girl who has enormous potential but is initially weak, yet later through the support of her friends and the ones that believe in her makes her a force to be reckoned with\" concept is fairly cheesy, cliche, and overused, Kill La Kill makes the best of a bad situation and uses it to their advantage. Whether it's Ryuuko challenging Satsuki in a battle in which she clearly would be outclassed yet comes out even due to the support of Mako or the strength of her resolve, or it's Ryuuko getting full of herself with her newfound strength, getting overconfident, then falling to an enemy she underestimates; while scenarios like these are extremely cliche, the unique flair and style Kill La Kill adds to these situations makes it captivating and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA heavily debated topic that Kill La Kill often sparks is over the concept of fan service. While your standard anime fan service will offer things such as, but not limited to, beach scenes with an irregular average guy to incredibly cute or beautiful girl ratio, a skirt flipped by the wind much to the chagrin of the embarrassed yet pretty young school girl etc etc, Kill La Kill's so called \"fan service\" is delivered in the form of heavily revealing battle outfits and consistent nudity with minimal censorship through light or objects. However, unlike most fan service scenes where the actual concept in question is brought to the viewers attention, Kill La Kill does a good job avoiding that. While there are parts where people ogle at Ryuuko's transformed state in Senketsu, or the Elite Four squabbling amongst themselves and telling each other to go put on some clothing, the show very well could have removed it completely and for the most part the foundation of the show would not have changed. For those who like it, all the more power to you. For those who despise it, looking past it or ignoring it will not diminish the impact the show has.\\n\\n\r\nFitting for a show like Kill La Kill, the art and sound complement the show tremendously. The artwork seems like it was drawn with vigor and the use of sharp lines and sketch marks makes battle scenes come to life. The soundtrack, in typical action anime fashion, does a very good job in matching the scene the episode is depicting. From tension-filled and ominous scenes accompanied by dark and sinister music to action-packed and flashy battle scenes with sharp and vivid background sounds, Kill La Kill does an excellent job piecing together a well coordinated story and soundboard. \\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill excels in drawing its audience in with larger than life battles, ridiculous yet clever nicknames for various special moves, secret operations, and over-the-top clothing, and fairly unpredictable plot twists and turns that evoke a wide range of emotions ranging from disappointment to shock and awe. It's a show that will be hit or miss for a majority of viewers, but one thing is for sure; it's difficult to be bored or not entertained while watching Kill La Kill.\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nWhen deciding whether an anime is good or not I always critique it based on a certain criteria, with well written story & characters being absolutely essential to qualify. But every now and then there's an anime title that comes along where conventional methods of critiquing become obsolete. These shows often focus on certain aspects that make them unique in their own right and doesn't follow conventional standards. May it be a mindless blockbuster style 'shoot em up' like Black Lagoon, an intense psychological roller coaster like Kaiji or a 'rule of cool' cultural mash-up like Samurai Champloo. These shows all havecertain aspects that make them stand out from the crowd and have garnered a following from fans because of it. \\n\r\nThen there are shows that take it to another extreme.. Shows that are powered by NONSENSICAL, STUPID, OVER THE TOP, FUCKIN INSANITY like FLCL, Gurren Lagann and Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt........but somehow, despite being illogical screwball nonsense, they actually manage to work. Now enter the next anime to take that mantle, Kill La Kill. An anime so ludicrous, so left field, so stupid that you can't help but have a smile plastered on your face from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a story to be found in KLK, it's safe to say many won't be watching it for a well written narrative. In fact the story is rather ridiculous, going from a simple revenge tale to global domination conspiracy where clothes are extraterrestrial lifeforms who developed human evolution. YES you heard me right, Charles Darwin theory of natural selection was a lie, it was clothes all along.\\n\r\nThe first half follows our protagonist Ryuuko Matoi as she climb the school hierarchy one step at a time defeating each opponent in order to find out the truth about her father's killer. This is done in a beat em up style, almost similar to a arcade fighting game. This lead to alot of high octane encounter that will capture the attentiveness of even the most jaded audience. \\n\r\nThe 2nd half is where they up the ante however with a conflict that spans beyond the initial one set to something on a global scale. Complete with a global domination plot and a megalomaniac. It's absurd but in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where this anime truly shines. Kill La Kill is a powerhouse of animated freedom. As superficial as judging something on how it looks is, there's no other way to express what this series stands for. It doesn't constrict itself to a set standard but rather switch to many different styles of animation. You can go from a mixture of watercolor brush stroked artsyle mixed with traditional techniques to a bunch of cardboard cutouts dancing across the screen without a moments notice. As left field as this sounds, it's this very off the wall cheap yet brilliant animation style that makes everything from the giant \"in your face\" letters to the vibrant colored madness to work. This is what elevates KLK  from being more than just being another action romp. The visual extravaganza will keep you hooked! Either that or give you a seizure. \\n\r\nNow where the show becomes repulsive  at times is the fanservice but if you've come into a ecchi anime and expect people dressed like nuns then slap yourself right now for being an idiot. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as lively as the anime it corresponds. With bombastic pop  pieces to orchestric rock and everything in-between, this wide range of scores does a good job of keeping up with the show's energetic pace. Both the sub and dub performances were also handled with care. Standouts being Carrie Keranen english voice acting for Satsuki Kiryuuin, in which she captured the iron clad personality flawlessly. Also both sub and dub performances for Mako Mankanshoku, which captured her bubbly off the wall attitude. Both OP and ED weren't anything worth listening to on a stand alone listen, since the pop rock songs can be heard in almost every other anime series but they still compliment the show to the very least. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWith an anime as lively as this one a cast of equal caliber of insanity is needed to match it. Take every character archetype and amplify it to ungodly proportions and you'll have your characters in a nutshell.\\n\r\nThe Elite Four are all over exaggerated stereotypes, Ragyou is a sadistic bitch and the rest follow suite in being over the top.\\n\r\nRyuuko Matoi is a rather refreshing female lead in a medium that treats its female characters as either a \"damsel in distress\" or just another harem girl to conquer. She is very head strong and loyal to her friends.\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there, KLK have yet another strong willed female in Satsuki Kiryuuin. These two play off as the whole \"two sides of the same coin\" gig but it never impedes upon the show's enjoyment. And last but not least, Mako Mankanshoku who provides comedic relief. You'd either love her goofy antics or find her annoying but there's no denying her role in the series, representing what KLK is all about. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before conventional critiquing doesn't really work for anime like this. Kill La Kill is something you have to personally experience to understand, its not something you can get a grasp of from word of mouth. That being said I got what I expected out of it and that was a fun ride and also a reminder of what makes anime, well.. \"anime\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe fanbase of this show have been proclaiming that \"this saved anime\" . while I don't believe that to be true, I can to the very least say that it's certainly a welcome addiction to the mix. Breathing new life into a medium that has grown stale. If you're tired of the dime a dozen school rom-coms, moe blobs and cardboard cutout MCs then this will certainly do the trick.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars!\u201d \u2013 Satsuki Kiryuin\r\nKill La Kill - My 40th review, and a very special one for me. \r\nDoes it need an introduction? As one of the most hyped, popular, and polarizing anime of 2013 (2013 was a big year for anime) it\u2019s likely that most everyone knows it by reputation, if not having seen it outright. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 10\r\nKill La Kill is unique. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s slightly dissimilar from what immediately marks the art style of anime as a whole, no- it\u2019s one of a kind. It\u2019s obvious that Trigger was under a budgetconstraint, being that this was their first major animation project as a new studio, AND an independent, original product. Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s signature style is the definitive way of describing KLK\u2019s visual aspects. His flair for scope and scale come together with great character designs and slightly rough, but mercurially animation. The new studio Trigger has set the standard for speed, quick cuts, and stretching the boundaries of what can be done with animation. The generally over the top style of Imaishi is incredible to behold here. No other anime has been able to look like and do what Kill La Kill has with a similar budget and time- it\u2019s a work of art purely out of talent. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nEdge: Japanese audio\\n\r\nI\u2019m typically not a proponent of sub or dub with any consistency. However, I will consistently defend that this show is immensely enjoyable to hear in EITHER language. My first and second viewings were in the original Japanese, which I immediately fell in love with. The incredibly dynamic performances are given by not only the main cast, but by even EVERYONE in the supporting cast!\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese cast is a group of superstars. An all veteran, amazing group of talent with a credit list as long as the Empire State building, this group has done it all. Ami Koshimizu and Ryouka Yuzuki head up the cast as Ryuko and Satsuki respectively. Aya Suzuki as the cocaine addicted hype woman Mako Mankanshoku couldn\u2019t have been a better fit. Toshihiko Seki, longtime VA, as Senketsu brought feeling and dynamics to an animate piece of clothing. Who can say that they made a Sailor Uniform feel more human than the casts of entire other shows put together? Finally, one of my favorites, Yukari Tamura, does some of her best work as the dual personalities of Nui Harime. The amount of work, feeling, and emotion put into these performances is absolutely immense. They sold the comedy, they played it straight to great effect, and they were able to wring out a heretofore inconceivable amount of hype and awesomeness in the vein of Gurren Lagann. The gold standard of how effective voice acting can be.\\n\\n\r\nWhere were you the first time you heard \u201cAmbiguous\u201d? One of the most immediately recognizable and memorable parts of Kill La Kill is the music. When \u201cBefore My Body Is Dry\u201d played the first time, it was destined to be a hit. Endless AMVs, mashups, English versions, covers, and basically any other form of remix have been done to it, and every song in the series- and for good reason: they\u2019re fantastic. Fantastic use of insert songs, namely different versions of Mika Kobayashi\u2019s \"Before My Body Is Dry\", high strung orchestral compositions, hard rock riffs, Heavenly choruses, and two of the most endlessly catchy openings in all of anime, one from Eir Aoi, \"Sirius\", and one from GARNiDELiA, the aforementioned \"Ambiguous\". I bought the soundtrack, and it\u2019s absolutely worth it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is again unique in that it can be viewed multiple times and have extremely varied ideas, themes, and metaphor/allegory pulled from it, depending on how it was seen. One can watch it purely at face value, and thoroughly enjoy the absolute insanity going on screen at any given time. It\u2019s got giant robots, it\u2019s got explosions, satire, parody, and it\u2019s got two hopped up, superpowered, scantily clad teenage girls going at it with swords ripping shit up! If that\u2019s all this show was, maybe the criticisms of it being mere male power fantasy and exploitative, titillating ecchi garbage would be valid. However, unlike Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers, there actually is more than meets the eye here.\\n\r\nDeep within the heart of the Life Fiber that makes up Kill La Kill is an intensely smart, metaphor and allegory heavy narrative that hearkens back into several important events in the history of Feudal Japan. There\u2019s also a ton of name symbolism, references and allegory for mythology, and gods of many religions, World War 2, commentary on the oppressive Japanese school and work culture, and an immediately obvious metaphor for the struggles of puberty and the ubiquitous coming of age tale. Ogres are like onions. They have \u2018layers.\u2019 Kill La Kill is like an onion. It has \u2018layers.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nTo start things off; the Honnouji Incident. In 1582, Oda Nobunaga had nearly subjugated and consolidated all of Japan, save the Kansai region, which consists of Kobe, Kyoto, and Osaka. He was overthrown in Kyoto by his general Akechi Mitsuhide and forced to commit suicide. Ragyo\u2019s plot to consolidate not only Japan, but also the world with the Life Fiber\u2019s power, and subsequent overthrowing are immediate similarities. \\n\r\nNot necessarily by one event, but the Fashion/Fascism theme is present throughout the story in the form of Honnouji Academy, and then overshadowed by Revocs and Ragyo herself. In both somewhat of a reference to Japan in WW2, and likening the Japanese educational system to that of a fascist dictatorship, Kill La Kill takes on a social commentary facet that is rather intriguing. With the overall theme of rebellion, finding oneself and one\u2019s place in society, these subjects mesh together quite well. \\n\\n\r\nTo give a bit of perspective; postwar Japan was not a pretty place. To help raise themselves out of the prior political system and stigma of the Emperor, the system was completely revamped into a more democratic one. Along with that came educational reform, which contributed greatly to their rapid economic recovery. Education became compulsory, for both boys and girls, and literacy rates skyrocketed to record highs. With educational increases so great, so too came with them the pressure to perform and correct what were perceived failures of the past. Coupled with the high pressure work culture, the school and educational environment followed suit- upholding and reinforcing the culturally revered values of hard work, loyalty, and determination to reap a high benefit in both status and monetarily- the idea of success. The school culture is much the same: mind your business, do what you\u2019re supposed to do, don\u2019t stick out, and be a good student. \\n\\n\r\nAs Kill La Kill relates to this: the idea that individuality, the sticking out, being your own person in the midst of the sea of little cogs that make the machine work is not only an acceptable thing, but necessary for growth. The uniformity and repeated character design of the no-star students is evident of this- and they appear eerily as a well-trained army at several points. They\u2019re small, insignificant, and easily replaceable, like little cogs. Ryuko is very obviously a Scissor blade shaped wrench being slung into the midst of this. Satsuki and the Elite Four are the \u201cfascist\u201d ruling party of the school, keeping everyone in line, keeping the machine that is the \u201cconquering\u201d educational system churning out perfect little cookie cutter shaped students in the mold of \u201cperfection\u201d. \u201cFear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! Contradiction is truth! Those are the facts of this world! And you will all surrender to them, you pigs in human clothing!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nFinishing tying up the puberty and finding oneself themes- Ryuko\u2019s individuality and bucking of the trend are struggles that every teen faces: the pressure to fit in, to be a perfect, molded student, and the desire to be something more- a person of your own choosing. As the story progresses, so too does this theme work its way not only into the other students, but the plot itself, on a more macro scale.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss Kill La Kill as being \u201cyet another shonen \u2018more power\u2019 show\u201d, or nonsensical childish entertainment- but again, this is the genius of Kill La Kill. It CAN be those things, if you want it to be. Kill La Kill is easy to watch as a shallow action series, no problem. The \u201cfanservice\u201d and hypersexualization are typically the first points detractors will bring up. Let it suffice to say that if that\u2019s the only negative about this show, then you missed the joke. Many anime in recent days have taken to pandering to the least common denominator entertainment viewers. Most people call this ecchi and fanservice. Kill La Kill lampshades this by taking it to the absolute extreme, calling attention to it, and not only moving on from it, but actually turning it into a plot point! Part of the whole idea expressed in the individualism is that of the clothing that we wear. The threads that bind- if you will. Kill La Kill brings a brilliant undertone of satire to the table in moments like these, lampooning things from the nudity and sexualization that are so prevalent now to other things, including entire genres and categorizations of anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut as I\u2019ve laid out above, and other themes I\u2019ve not discussed, it\u2019s what\u2019s under the surface that makes this a true diamond in the collective crust of anime as a whole. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nRyuko Matoi is the quintessential school delinquent. Kicked out of several high schools prior to her arrival at Honnouji Academy due to violent altercations and a penchant for trouble, Ryuko is searching for her father\u2019s murderer. Wielding her half of a giant pair of magical scissors and clad in every stereotype of ecchi, shonen, superpower, and male fantasy, she\u2019s a walking subversion of magical girl, and essentially every trope of the aforementioned genres. Ryuko personifies willpower, determination, and the ability to win against all odds- similarly to her shonen counterparts- but with a twist. She\u2019s plainly aware of what she\u2019s doing. \\n\r\nThe typical shonen plot revolves around some young kid who gains a superpower and uses it to fight against whatever indignities they find themselves confronted with, with a smattering of chibi humor, goofy situations, and thinly veiled attempts at heavy handed morality lessons about the nature of responsibility or whatever. \\n\r\nRyuko throws all this out the window. New powers? Cool, let\u2019s do it. Aren\u2019t you at all bothered by this immense amount of death and destruction you\u2019ve wrought against the populace in your quest to uncover the truth about your father? Nope, not really. \\n\\n\r\nRyuko represents the unsureness and unknown world of breaking out of the teen shell, but while still being a child. This is symbolized in her relationship with Senketsu and the Mankanshoku Family. She begins as anyone- with an idea of a goal, but no real means of achieving it, until she comes into a means that allow her to transform into her full potential: the Kamui. In order for her to be able to fight for what she wants, she has to grow, both as a person, and in strength. As explained in the show, the reason Senketsu is unable to fully support her and uses her blood to such a degree,  is that she hasn\u2019t opened up to him, or embraced the fear and shame of having all ya stuff out there on display for the sake of being empowered. It\u2019s about fear of the unknown, stepping outside your boundaries, and coming face to face with what you have to deal with to get along in this world. As seen in episode 12, Ryuko isn\u2019t some infallible shonen character; consumed by her rage- a symbol for the teen angst and hormone imbalances that cause such instability- she loses control- and sight of what it is that was her ultimate goal: was it vengeance against the murderer of her father, or her fight against injustice for herself?\\n\r\nMany use this point of the Kamui turning Ryuko and Satsuki into scintillating displays of fanservice to dismiss any possibility of character growth, but this is simply not the case. In fact, the Kamui transformations are yet another subversion of magical girl and ecchi/fanservice tropes that are so common now. Ryuko is very self-aware, and to a point, embarrassed about how the transformation renders her outfit into a stripperific costume- it\u2019s lampshaded, and moved on from. The nudity and oversexualization are never the point of the story as they would be in a lesser show- but are worked into this ever revolving, multifaceted work of art. \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki herself is an allegory straight out of history: being both the aforementioned conqueror Oda Nobunaga and the usurper Akechi Mitsuhide. The relationship between Ragyo and Satsuki, who has conquered all the schools in Japan except those three of the Kansai region, is very reminiscent of this historical event. Satsuki, alongside Ryuko, goes on a personal journey as well- one of the struggles of the expectations of your elders, parents, and of society upon the displaced, out of element teen. Satsuki\u2019s fight is not one of vengeance for a lost loved one, but one of finding herself, and her place in the world outside of the demands of her mother. \\n\r\nIn episode 25, Satsuki gets some of the best characterization I\u2019d seen in the show, a shame that it was so late coming. When she\u2019s defeated her enemies, quelled all the issues in front of her, and finished her fight- which is all that she\u2019s known -what else is there for her beyond that? When the intense struggle against your entire being is all the history you\u2019ve ever had, what happens when the conflict finally ends? What are you then, when your only definition has been fighting and struggling? The story of Satsuki putting down the sword is really touching, and gives her a more humane side, and full circle of character that was very enjoyable to see play out after the fierceness and strife that she was up until that point.\\n\\n\r\nThe Elite Four are representative of the four heavenly kings of Buddhist Mythology and the mystical apes: Do, See, Hear, and Speak No Evil. The Buddhist heavenly kings are: Tamon-ten, he who hears all; Zojo-ten, he who causes growth; Jikoku-ten, he who upholds the realm; and Komoku-ten, he who sees all.\\n\r\nGamagoori, as chairman of the disciplinary committee would obviously be Do No Evil, and Jikoku-ten, who \u2018upholds\u2019 the discipline. \\n\r\nSanageyama is blind, but sees all. \\n\r\nJakuzure is the princess of sound, which makes Hear No Evil and Zojo-ten make sense here, where she continually gets larger and more powerful Symphony Regalia. \t\\n\r\nInumuta represents Speak No Evil, and Tamon-ten, due to his intelligence network and powers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs a product: it\u2019s a complete entertainment package. It\u2019s riotously funny, it\u2019s off the wall, left field crazy. Like FLCL before it, this is sort of an amalgam of a myriad of things that are enjoyable and what make anime fun: over the top battles, drama, a touch of politics, mystery and intrigue, fun characters, and one statement I don\u2019t throw out much, but applies here: \u201cOnly Japan.\u201d That\u2019s really the best way to describe it; it\u2019s so wild and out there that it could have only come from one place.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the puns and wordplay jokes that are signature to well written Japanese humor coupled with Imaishi\u2019s penchant for lowdown, dirty jokes play out hilariously in this. Due to the fact that the title of the show itself, and a significant portion of the plot are also based wholly off of puns in the Japanese language, it makes it that much sweeter. To extrapolate: Kill La Kill is obviously English. Duh, you moron. \\n\r\nKiru ra Kiru would be the romaji- the kanji on which the pronunciation of Kiru comes from has the triple meaning (or readings) of \u201cto cut\u201d, \u201cto kill\u201d, or \u201cto wear\u201d- the central plot points. Fashion and Fascism are English loanwords, which are both alliterative, and again, play a major role here. Perhaps the most interesting, and that tie up the ends of the Oda Nobunaga/Japan unification (along with the end of this review) and the plot are the words \u201cconquest\u201d and \u201cuniform\u201d. Seifuku is the romaji, which comes from kanji that can be read as either conquest or uniform. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much left to be said about this series than what I\u2019ve already laid out. An in depth analysis of themes, symbols, and deeper meaning is what I felt was the only appropriate way to amalgamate the subject matter and do justice to this incredible series. This was the review I never thought I would be able to write. There were so many things I loved about Kill La Kill that it may be impossible to list them- but I\u2019ve done my due diligence to try and set into words the vast complex of topics that set this show apart from any other I\u2019ve seen, and potentially any other in existence. It\u2019s my favorite, after all. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr (Yeah, I see you, you review skipping pig in human clothing)\\n\\n\r\n+ Intricately woven plot replete with metaphor, allegory, and symbolism; alternately viewable as a shallow action series- up to you.\\n\r\n+ Dynamic, over the top, intense Voice Acting by great veterans and noobs alike\\n\r\n+ Absolutely hilarious\\n\r\n+ Great action scenes, set pieces, and a very unique art style.\\n\r\n+/- Perceived fanservice may be offputting, but it\u2019s part of the parody!\\n\r\n+/- Very Imaishi- fast, crude jokes, everything you expect from his productions\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely. Kill La Kill is a complete, consummate package of entertainment. Inspirational, brilliant, funny, thought provoking, and endlessly entertaining: the experience that makes anime as a medium worth it for the sheer infinity of possibilities. \\n",

            "content": "Whether or not you possess the capacity to stomach over-the-top dialogues, scenes and atmosphere in a show is a decisive factor when it comes to what you\u2019d ultimately feel about Kill la Kill when you watch it. It is a really fun show for those that can stomach OTT stuff. On the other hand, it is a cringe-worthy ride for those that can\u2019t. The first episode starts off with our protagonist, Ryuko Matoi, challenging the Student Council president Kiryuin Satsuki holding a giant blade that is apparently one half of what makes a huge pair of scissors. That, my friend, in itself is enough togive you an idea as to how ridiculous this show is. If ridiculous isn\u2019t your cup of tea then you ought to stay away from this series. Oh, and then there\u2019s the fact that almost every single episode consists of scantily clad girls fighting it out with each other. If you can\u2019t stand some skin, please walk away from this series. Because you will see a lot of skin. Both female and male fanservice is present in this show in spades.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is brought to you by studio Trigger. The people who brought us Little Witch Academia and Inferno Cop. And these are the same guys who worked on TTGL. With a good number of people who put this on their watch list being aware of it being made by those that made TTGL, they\u2019re obviously bound to have a few expectations. The over-the-top atmosphere and the similar art styles the shows share don\u2019t help, either. But, ultimately, they\u2019re different shows. And thus should be judged differently. That\u2019s enough about TTGL, though. Let\u2019s get on to the categories I\u2019ll cover in this review -\\n\\n\r\nThis review will be divided into the following sections: \\n\\n\r\n1. Art & Animation\\n\r\n2. Soundtrack\\n\r\n3. Characters\\n\r\n4. Story\\n\\n\r\n----Art & Animation----\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s art style is a far cry from the typical art style most anime these days possess. It is much more cartoon-ish in nature in comparison. But that doesn\u2019t mean it is a negative point against the show at all. In fact, the show plays it to its strength by using the potential of a cartoon-ish art style to its fullest \u2013 the highly exaggerated scenes, as a result, prove to be far more effective than they\u2019d be under normal circumstances. As a result, the art style is definitely something that fits the show to a \u2018t\u2019 and compliments its OTT nature greatly. It is a definite 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe same, however, cannot be said for the animation. Kill la Kill was made under a tight budget and, as such, there have been plenty of instances in the show where the creators had to cut corners. They try to minimize animation during the non-action scenes and generally put all the budget into the action scenes. As a result, there\u2019s an immense amount of variation in the animation quality throughout the series. There are fights like the ones in episode 3 that look brilliant and are very fluid and well choreographed. And then there are scenes where you\u2019d feel like you\u2019re looking at a bunch of slides with a few moving parts. The show DOES, however, deserve a pat on the back to actually try and use its limited budget to its fullest \u2013 a lot of times they use limited frames in comedy scenes to hilarious effect. In fact, there\u2019s a character in this show whose movements almost always comprise of ridiculous paper-like movements that consist of minimal movement in terms of frames. It doesn\u2019t look fluid in the least but it somehow fits. You\u2019d understand if you see it for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, since the show doesn\u2019t actually possess terrific animation throughout, I\u2019ll have to lower its score in this category a bit. It gets a 6.5/10 for its animation.\\n\\n\r\n----Soundtrack----\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really need to speak much when it comes to its sountrack. I\u2019m personally a big fan and I think its OST was downright amazing. Character themes fit and the background OST is almost never off the mark. A definite 10/10 on this front.\\n\\n\r\n----Characters----\\n\r\nThey\u2019re all fairly good with a decent amount of backstory \u2013 a sufficient amount which is JUST right. The characters that stand out are definitely Ryuko, Satsuki and Mako. Former two are the main characters of the series and rivals. They\u2019re always at each other\u2019s throats \u2013 as if fated to be enemies. These two receive the most screen-time. Ryuko, the MC, faces problems like identity crisis and goes berserk a few times. The story is ~apparently~ supposed to be a coming-of-age story so a teenage girl having a lot of mood-swings and being very impulsive in nature probably doesn\u2019t seem out-of-character. But she can be annoying to some due to it anyway. I personally found it really annoying when she had an outburst in episode 19. Mostly because she has had similar outbursts not too long ago. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nMako, on the other hand, is more of a comedic side-kick than a main character. She is eccentric and hyperactive. Her gags can be hit or miss for people depending on their perspective. Personally found her and her antics highly enjoyable and a breath of fresh air when compared to contemporary sidekicks. There are two more that I would love to talk about but I shall not because they\u2019re integral to the plot and disclosing information about them could be considered a spoiler. Anyway, as far as character development is concerned, it is present, yes. But not *too* much of it. The only character in the series that gets proper development in this series is Ryuko\u2019s rival, Kiryuin Satsuki. Ryuko, on the other hand, pales in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series consists of a highly female-oriented cast. The males are present, yeah, but it is the women who possess boobs of steel, strength and ambition to do things their way. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets a 7/10 in this category.\\n\\n\r\n----Story----\\n\r\nA pretty simple set-up. And a very entertaining story. There were a few ups and downs between episodes 7 and 15 but the series has managed to be highly entertaining for the most part. Do not go into it expecting it to be a deep story and you\u2019ll probably have a lot of fun. It starts off with a monster of the week format, goes on with it for a few episodes, and then shifts gears. It is only after episode 12 that some revelations come to light and we come to know more about the big shots. And not before episode 15 does the series start having some serious plot progression. Before episode 15 the series did possess a very chaotic pacing as far as events-per-episode are concerned but the rate of overall plot progression was very slow. Which led some fans to say \u201cYou haven\u2019t TRULY seen Kill la Kill if you haven\u2019t seen past episode 15 yet\u201d. And I\u2019m inclined to agree with them to a degree. The series does pick up quite a bit after that. Don\u2019t expect a shit-ton of character development or earth-shattering revelations , though. It is all pretty predictable. What make the things that take place in these episodes so damn effective is the execution \u2013 Trigger does an amazing job at showing off predictable events in an unpredictable fashion. They\u2019re masters when it comes to it and it makes the recent episodes look really, really good when compared to the episodes that precede them. It ends on a satisfying note, too. Slightly disappointing if you are expecting things to escalate to infinity and beyond but, like I said, its end is definitely not something you\u2019d consider a bad end. It wraps up things nicely. Of course, there are a few loose ends and things that you\u2019d consider plot-holes but they\u2019re mostly minor for the most part and story was never its strength anyway. I\u2019ll conclude by saying that it turns out VERY different from how it starts off. You probably won\u2019t believe the first and last episodes are parts of the same show if they didn\u2019t share characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it gets a 6.5/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\n----Final Thoughts----\\n\r\nI think this is definitely a series worth checking out. Do not expect it to be anything \u2013 just judge it for what it is rather than for what it could\u2019ve been or what you wanted it to be. A series with a good art style and creative yet dramatic cuts, amazing soundtrack, a fun cast and just over-the-top action. Definitely check it out if you\u2019re into action anime. Or if you are just looking for an over-the-top series that isn\u2019t afraid of doing things that are considered very far-fetched or out-of-the-box. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating \u2013 7/10. The rating takes enjoyment into account as well. Although I personally have it listed as a 9/10 on my list because I\u2019m highly biased when it comes to this show. I did try to keep my personal bias away from this review, though. And I hope I was successful in that regard \u2013 please provide feedback and let me know whether or not that was the case. Both helpful and unhelpful votes are appreciated as long as you guys let me know the +ves and \u2013ves of this review to me on my profile. Thank you for reading and I hope I was helpful.",

            "content": "Kill La Kill is the first original work from Trigger, a studio founded by a couple former Gainax employees. It ran from October of last year to March of this year. Its head writer was Nakashima Kazuki, who was also one of the series writers for Gurren Lagann. So, how did Trigger's initial foray into an original series go? \r\nStory:\r\nOur tale opens with the militant Honnouji Academy getting a new transfer student. Enter our protagonist, Matoi Ryuuko. She's traveled across the country looking for leads about her father's killer. The trail has led to Honnouji, where the student counsel President, Satsuki, rules with an ironfist and students' positions in her hierarchy determine where they can live and what kinds of jobs their families can hold. Ryuuko demands answers from Satsuki only to be beaten by one of her minions who's using a magic uniform that grants him superhuman powers. Yes, the premise really involves magical clothing. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuko slinks back to her father's burnt lab, falling through a trap door. Inside she finds a magic sailor uniform that talks to her and grants her super powers but needs her blood to activate. Ryuuko decides to put an end to Satsuki's ambitions and force her to tell the truth about her father's death. But the secret of Honnouji Academy goes far deeper than she realises. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this story is pretty weak and largely just serves to transport Ryuuko from one over the top action or comedic sequence to the next. The plot twists come out of nowhere with nothing foreshadowing them whatsoever, but a lot of them are really predictable in spite of that simply because they're really clich\u00e9. The attempts at comedy fall short as well, usually being based on either the idea that nudity is funny or rambling that borders on incoherent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe only characters who even gravitate towards two dimensions are Satsuki and Ryuuko, the rest are firmly rooted one-dimensional archetypes. Whether it's the friend, the loyal minion, the bloke who loves to fight or something else entirely. The only thing that really sets them apart from the usual archetype is that they're more over the top. Kill La Kill subscribes to the notion that subtlety and depth are unnecessary. It just tries to exaggerate the casts' archetypal qualities to make them the most extreme versions it possibly can. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this looks pretty bad. The characters look like blank-faced action figures with proportions out of a bad 90s comic. The action sequences are frequently difficult to follow with an over-emphasis on flashy effects and special attacks that just strain your eyes more often than not. \\n\\n\r\nThe outfits are really fan-servicey as well, but I'm pretty certain the designs are being used in an attempt at comedy. Both because the art style does not lend itself to actual fan-service and because the anime draws attention to how ridiculous the outfits are on several occasions. The problem is the execution. Everything is ridiculously exaggerated in this anime so the over the top fan-service doesn't come across as tonally different from anything else, be it serious or not. Furthermore, while a joke at the expense of how ridiculous fan-service can be could work in a short piece or when used sparingly in a longer work, the series is decently long with twenty four episodes, all of which keep the same ridiculous outfits. If they wanted them to serve as a parody, they really should have replaced them with something actually practical instead of coming up with a contrived excuse for why they couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is awful. Like the art, story and characters, it's ridiculously exaggerated. The actors usually sound like they're reading off of their scripts as quickly as they can with little to no range of emotion. The actors who get it the worst are Suzaki Aya, Shintani Mayumi and Hiyama Nobuyuki. It doesn't help that Hiyama is the only one of those three I've heard in roles that required actual acting skill. That being said, the series also has Seki Toshihiko, Yuzuki Ryoka, Koshimizu Ami and Tamura Yukari all of whom are very good, but you wouldn't know that with their performances in this. So, it is very likely a fault with the direction. The music is kind of generic action fare. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 4/10. Things get pretty homo-erotic between Mako and Ryuuko. Satsuki and Nonon are also implied to be more than friends. Nui is openly into other girls, even getting a kiss scene at one point. Then you have Ragyou, who gropes her own daughter in several different scenes. To be fair to Kill La Kill, these scenes are supposed to be creepy and are played up as such.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this is the fourth anime I've seen in a row that's had incestuous content to some degree. What's next, a boy having a crush on a clone of his mum? Would any series really be that stupid? \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is a mindless, over the top, action series. This \u201cover the top\u201d aesthetic does give the series something different from the usual mindless action schlock, but I'm not sure if that's to its benefit. It's not even over the top in an enjoyable way like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It's just mind-numbingly stupid in terms of plot, characters, art and acting but at least it's relatively harmless. If you're a fan of that kind of exaggerated comedy, you might enjoy it. If you aren't, there's really nothing that this series can offer you. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, I'll look at Neon Genesis Evangelion.",

            "content": "When everything is said and done, anime only has one purpose: to entertain. If it fails to do so, it is deemed exactly so, and those who strive to create such entertainment shy away from the subject as a result. On the contrary, if a single anime is deemed so entertaining by the masses that they are willing to rip each other to pieces in order to get a glimpse of what more could be done with the series, those who strive to create such entertainment might feel pressured into doing so out of obligation and greed, rather than for the intended purpose. While thiscontinues to happen, the quality of certain series only continue to skyrocket with each sequel. If there were any series that were to come out within the last couple years that I feel deserves to be left untouched, it would be Kill la Kill, studio Trigger's very first anime blockbuster.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is the creation of director Hiroyuki Imaishi, who is most known for directing titles such as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Panty Stocking and Garterbelt. What becomes common knowledge while watching Imaishi's works is that he has a tendency to overexaggerate. Fight scenes, overall animation and design, fan service, and story telling are a few notable examples of subjects that Imaishi toys with in every creation. This trend isn't broken in Kill la Kill, as the very beginning sequence shows. No context, no background checks, just a quick overview of what the viewer comes to witness and the story begins. While intimidating, this type of story telling can benefit the viewer by baiting them into feeling more immersed in the story, as if they were actually there, as ignorant as the youthful characters within the series. The only information given at the beginning of the series is that Honnouji Academy, a school grounds of epic proportions, is being run by a terrorizing force in Satsuki Kiryuuin. The only thing in her way is Ryuuko Matoi, a strong, developing individual who suddenly appears in Honnouji Academy to search for her father's murderer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kill la Kill grows as with its progression, ultimately becoming more substantial than anyone starting the series could ever imagine. The other thing that comes with this type of plot is the magnitude of unrealistic situations. No matter the event, Kill la Kill ultimately can't escape some of the shounen cliches that it means to spoof, leaving them in a state of laughing at their own misery. However, what the series does so well all throughout is hold its ground; no matter what happens, the characters, the plot, the animation, all will make it through to the end, by any means possible. What Kill la Kill accomplishes with this is what was meant to be accomplished in Imaishi's other series: entertaining the viewer through sheer spectacle. Despite the plot's flaws and unrealistic qualms, the story is entertaining to view from every standpoint, even from the stingiest of mindsets.\\n\\n\r\nThose who inhabit such a sporadic plot are sure to be colorful, right? To varying degree, the series does well in creating characters who match the overall tone. Ryuuko Matoi is the main heroine of the series, and that role is never relinquished, even in times of hardship. Her growth as a character is only slightly embellished, while her overall progression of strength may seem strange to some. Mako Mankanshoku, Ryuuko's friend and the show's main source of comedy, is the epitome of what kind of character can evolve from the rapid-paced animation of Kill la Kill. Very rarely is she shown in a normal state of balance, always bouncing off of walls and displaying unrealistic feats of human biology. She's legitimately funny, which is always nice to see from a longer-running series. Satsuki Kiryuuin as a villain is about as grand a performance as any series could ever hope to accomplish. She sticks to her beliefs and crushes those who oppose her, even those who were at one point accepting of her rule. Her cold demeanor makes her somewhat disheartening as an overall character, but, along with Ryuuko, Satsuki becomes just as three-dimensional as any valid character. The side characters serve their roles well, but almost never stray out of it, almost as if the very thought would kill them instantly. With a series like this, it wouldn't surprise me. Regardless, every character feels genuinely important to the plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat fully deserves a round of applause from every person within an Earth-sized radius of the North Pole is the animation. It's rare to see so much effort put into the fluidity of the animation. The fight scenes are flashy and well drawn. The characters' designs are interesting, along with every outfit they choose to wear. The only thing I could care to point out is that when compared to high-quality works of this time period, Kill la Kill seems almost old-fashioned, but that might be a point in of itself. Most, if not all, entertainment derived from this show can be traced back to how fluid and smooth on the eyes the art style is. If one were allowed to mention one key point about Kill la Kill as a whole, animation might be a common choice.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing about Kill la Kill's art style is the amount of fan service present within each episode. While, admittedly, the first few episodes almost relied on it, the connection to the characters and the focus on the plot almost makes one forget that they're basically fighting naked. The outfits worn by each character are so stylishly designed, I'd even suggest that what isn't shown of the female body is almost more alluring than what is. A distraction from the distraction, if you will. Using fan service from one taste to combat fan service from another taste. Kill la Kill is just as much a battle of where to pay attention as it is a battle against characters.\\n\\n\r\nA series as entertaining as Kill la Kill is bound to give pressure to its creators to create something just as amazing, if not better, than what they can handle. They could always try to appease their appetite with an appetizer, such as an elongated OVA or a few movies, but to recreate the magic that Kill la Kill left within an audience will be a difficult task to accomplish, if they decide to continue the series. Whatever they choose to do, Kill la Kill is enough to leave any fan either clamoring for more or feeling satisfied with a creatively diverse story. Despite some issues with realism, every question that arose with Trigger's first official tv series, whether it be its ability to entertain or its animation skills, were checked off with every passing episode, and met with a solid following.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is the most ridiculously absurd, incredibly shallow, quickly paced, and unconstitutionally brainless show that I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  The show works, and it works well.  Almost every episode has a hype quotient far beyond anything I've ever seen.  The reason it's such a great show is because you watch an episode and are constantly fed nonstop craziness, and its just barrels of fun to watch.  Let's break it down.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAlright, so normally I wouldn't give a story like this an 8.  There's a lot of plotholes, there's a lot to be desired, and thestory is very typical.  At the same time, it's fast-paced nonstop action, mixed in with an absolutely absurd plot with plenty of twists in turns.  It helps not to look into it too much.  The show is a lot of fun and action, it's got moments of drama and seriousness, and looking into it too much just makes it less fun for you.  If you're planning on getting technical about it and bringing the story in for review by critics, you're not going to have a good time.  If you're going to watch the show and scream \"FUCK YEAH\" when something awesome happens and let your cynicism melt away, the drama will be intense and the storyline epic, it's really up to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best parts.  The backgrounds are beautiful, the characters have nice designs, and the whole show is basically about clothes, and the designs of the outfits were also well done.  The art is a little risque at times, but in terms of pure quality, the animation varies from humorously bad to scary good.  The fight scenes are outstanding and deserve all the praise they get.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like the soundtrack, I'm afraid you may have lost your way.  The soundtrack of the show is incredible, the song choices are impeccable, and the music always adds to the crazy levels of hype and excitement that each episode brings.  The soundtrack is truly one of the crowning features of the show, with plenty of songs that are amazing outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved every character (well, loved in a 'they were a good character' way), all the main ones were well-written, though at times a little cliche, but there wasn't really a character that didn't pull their weight.  The interactions between them are fun to watch, their motivations and values are clear, and they act consistently for the most part.  There's clear development, and they all bring something new to the table.  The villains are intimidating, the heroes were endearing and had depth and unique personalities, and the supporting characters were also fun to watch and were given their own personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a show that was meant to be enjoyed.  It wasn't designed to make you ponder life, or to make you cry or feel emotions, or to make some sort of political statement, or even to provide a storyline that was intriguing enough to warrant coming back each week.  It's pure, unadulterated fun, and at the end of the episode I never failed to want more.  It's like candy, light, tasty, enjoyable and leaves you wanting more.  There's a reason that the hype train for this show never stops, and it's because the hype never ends, it just gets more intense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally award tens, but I'm making an exception.  I thoroughly enjoyed each and every second of Kill la kill.  It was crazy, it shoved fan-service into my face, and exaggerated fights as far as possible.  In the end, I just wish there was more.  The characters were all wonderful, and even a sailor uniform becomes lovable.  All in all, Kill la Kill is something you watch when you want to have fun and get excited, and it succeeded so well in doing that that it deserves a ten.  I make a point to grade shows based on what they were aiming for or what their purpose or goal is, and Kill la Kill was perfect in that regard.  It has truly saved anime.",

            "content": "[9.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nKill la Kill is not a stupid show. I want to draw this line now. A stupid show is one that blatantly contradicts its established settings or fails to draw verisimilitude by continually destroying its own lack of believability within the world it created. From the very first episode, the world of Kill la Kill remained intact and it never strained my disbelief. This show is silly, not stupid. It revels in its ridiculousness because, as this show blatantly states multiple times, that is the world they live in. It is ridiculous, absurd, and every synonym in between. The premise of the universe is, afterall, based on a pun. Well, two puns.\\n\\n\r\nSince Kill la Kill\u2019s world is surrounded around the concept of clothing and what they fundamentally mean, whether it is their show of power or submission, the writers at Trigger elevate that. Fashion, in Japanese, is spelt exactly like fascist, which is an ongoing motif and trait in many of the characters. While the term Seifuku, means both uniform and conquest. Which is also an important theme within the universe in Kill la Kill. With this in mind, every revelation, however absurd and over-the-top, still remains believable within the rules and structure of the world, therefore maintaining the verisimilitude created in the first episode. Put simply, it is ridiculous and silly, but not stupid. \\n\\n\r\nEven throughout the show as characters grow and spawn new tools of destruction seemingly at whim, the ideas and themes persist. One may argue that nonsensical elevation is inherently stupid, as it strains the viewers preconceived notions of what is relatable, while I believe that the world within a show or film can be as ludicrous as the creators want, as long as the characters remain grounded, however insane their outward appearance may be. Characters, after all, make the setting, not vice versa. Characters are the most important element to long-form storytelling and are single-handedly responsible for most viewer\u2019s connection to the story being told. Kill la Kill is at its best when it is exploring its characters motivations, revelations, and ideals through outlandish set pieces and outrageous dialogue. This elevates this seemingly simple story of revenge to something special. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Themes of an Indulgent World]\\n\\n\r\nThe first, and probably most standout element of the show is its immediate hook. The idea that this world runs of clothes and how this simple concept progressively becomes elevated by clashing ideals. This universe, created by the staff at Trigger is intrinsically indulgent due to its focus on scantily clad girls fighting in massive arenas. It further elevates its indulgence by making it so everyone is scantily clad. Equal opportunity fan service. The simple idea is that it is humanity, as in, the body you are born with, is worth fighting over the restrictive, controlling nature of clothing, as it hides who you are. This base theme that permeates throughout Kill la Kill is the driving force of its indulgence. \\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding this, you begin to comprehend the rules that you will be seeing sprout throughout the series. The elements being foreshadowed from earlier episodes coming to fruition later on in this show is a staple, which overjoyed me because a lot of anime I\u2019ve seen seems to lack the concept of foreshadowing. The idea of sex and body positivity encompasses Kill la Kill and I couldn\u2019t be happier. All of a sudden, the potentially over-indulgent shots of our heroines toned figure becomes something to cheer on, rather than roll your eyes at. \\n\\n\r\nThis idea is something I touched on while discussing Prison School. Sex shouldn\u2019t be demonized. Showing the beauty of the human body is a positive and should remain so. However, sacrificing characters, story, and believability for some marketing based on a bunch of colorful waifu-bait girls? Now that is where my problem with a lot of anime comes in. It isn\u2019t that the buzzword \u201cfanservice\u201d is something I hate; it is the exploitative nature of it that is over-utilized and simply doesn\u2019t belong in many of the areas which is encompasses.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill subverts this entire notion by making the entire world it is set in like this. Nudity is not just a theme, but an ideal that all our protagonists end up believing in. Not nudity in the sexual light, but nudity in the human light. Being naked drifts away from being crude and over-indulgent to being the norm in this show, and I believe that this was exactly the point. It was a clever way to still market these attractive characters while still forging a new kind of story that I have yet been seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\nMeta-narrative is nothing new, but the general focus in anime on it has been criticism of these elements while still undoubtedly doing them. Trigger doesn\u2019t criticize as much as it indulges in, and does incredibly well. By creating a world focused solely on battling clothes, they draft the schematics for applicability in the skin they want to desperately show and market. This is genius. I\u2019ve never seen a show that wears its base notions its sleeve. I shouldn\u2019t even say that. I\u2019ve never seen a show that fully embraces what it is in world, characters, and themes, so much so that feels like I\u2019m watching a show that is naked. In the end, that is the point. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters within a Naked World]\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in my introduction, the characters are this show's strongest parts, and Kill la Kill has no end to strong elements. Following our unusual protagonist, Ryuuko Matoi, who dawns one-half a scissor blade crafted by her mysterious father. She finds her way to Honnouji Academy, which is ruled by student body president Satsuki Kiryuuin. She proceeds to meet all sorts of wonderful characters, such as the elite four student body council, as well as her best friend Mako Mankonshoku. She is also forms a bond with the one other item crafted by her father, the life-fiber suit, Senketsu. We are then swept away on a journey to discovering who her father was, why she lost him, and who she is. \\n\\n\r\nThen this show surprised me. Rounding out the shows first arc, which lead into the mid-show finale, I realized that I have never quite been invested in a Shounen action anime before. I never connected with the characters and I never cared for the overly-righteous moralizing that they all seem to love. However, rounding out this first arc I actually felt the urge to press on and watch episode after episode, fully invested in what is happening. Not because the story being told was something astounding, but because the characters surrounding this story are, in my opinion, the best anime characters I\u2019ve ever seen. That is as simply as I can put it without spoiling too much. There was something hard to pinpoint which made them so likeable, endearing, but more importantly, thematically and dramatically engaging. It is that I began realizing that the antagonists this show was focusing on weren\u2019t really as antagonistic as I initially expected.\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of moral grey, without completely converting characters into the moralistic attitude of the protagonist, is what is genuinely lacking in so many action anime that I\u2019ve seen. Perhaps I\u2019ve been stricken with bad luck and hopefully more shows are like this, but so many anime seems to revel in black and white morals that they instantly become too easy to \u201cget\u201d, and completely unrealistic in terms of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nIn Kill la Kill, the base antagonists within the shows first half haven\u2019t done anything that is completely antagonistic. Specifically, Satsuki who is my favorite character in the show, becomes so tragic and understandable without actually expositing why. So, when the narrative elements become clear, you feel like this show succeeded in portraying the inner-emotion behind her without spelling them out for you. I\u2019ll say this again; I have never seen an anime do something like this. Satsuki and her eyebrows are the most captivating part of the show and what ultimately make the final battle being fought palatable to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict becomes one of ideals in the first half, which leads to a true threat being endlessly more imposing. It manifests itself with Ragyou Kiryuuin, Satsuki\u2019s mother, who is, in my opinion, one of the most effective villains I\u2019ve ever seen in anime as well. This is simply because the pains she\u2019s caused is towards characters I\u2019m affectionate towards, rather than characters I\u2019m forced to feel affectionate towards. That is an important distinction to draw. I started caring about these characters before the show exposited why I should, and that is perhaps the show's strongest moment. Ragyou does things that are brutally difficult to watch simply because they are done to characters I like. This has never actually happened to me before in action anime and it constantly left my jaw dropped after these later episodes finished. The feeling of empathy and ultimate catharsis was much bigger than I could ever anticipate from a show like this, which made it more memorable. Ragyou\u2019s parallels to real world fascism relate back to the base thematic elements of Kill la Kill, as well. I remember one scene which explained Satsuki\u2019s disdain towards a previously established element and eventual lashing out, filled me with emotion and anger. This felt so refreshing to me, as I\u2019ve never had those feelings while watching a shounen action anime.  \\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of episodes, there are plenty of thematic reversals which feel ultimately earned due to how much pathos ends up being felt towards many of these characters, specifically Satsuki. Trigger did a standout job with the characters. Even a lot of the secondary\u2019s had enough quirks to them to make them likeable enough to care about, simply through the situations, both comedic and serious, they went through to bond with one another. Another character that could\u2019ve easily fallen into the \u201ctoo random and annoying to be useful\u201d category of eccentric anime girls is Mako, who ends up actually providing more to this show than I initially expected. I ended up really enjoying her presence and levity. The ability to mix brutal seriousness with relieving gags is what makes Kill la Kill standout.  I cannot give enough praise to this element of the show. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn\u2019t have a large budget. In fact, I\u2019d say that it operates on a budget, but more importantly, a time frame that is significantly smaller than it needs. However, that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being visually pleasing and creating magnificent set-pieces. I want to make it clear, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of budget you are working on as much as it matters how much talent and effort the animators put into what they are working on. Budget, as it is, only affects the ability to hire people, not the actual quality of the work being produced. Time is the essence to creating something beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kill la Kill does is utilize its integrally bizarre world for comedy. This show tries, and mostly succeeds, at being funny. Not just because it crafts funny characters, such as Mako, but because it indulges in its theme so much that it just becomes funny to watch. This is shown through presentation, which is great. The lack of time and budget can still craft elegant scenes, but also, more commonly, crudely animated humorous scenes. Instead of hiding it, much like everything else, Trigger embraces this aspect and with it, and creates some of the most memorable scenes and sequences I\u2019ve ever seen in anime. Whether it is the way a certain character gets thrown off the edge, or the jolt-y and convincing demonstration of Mako\u2019s ideals, to the random bouts of beautifully animated frame-by-frame moments which stick out like sore thumbs, but also fit perfectly in rhythm with the entire show. No television anime usually operates on a huge budget or on a huge time-frame, but Kill la Kill uses its restraints like a trampoline.\\n\\n\r\nThis is further exemplified by the stylistic elements. The over-abundance of still-frame poses as letters fly on screen signifying a new ability or character introduction to the capacity to convey a character's position within the story simply through their movement, or lack thereof. Kill la Kill plays with scale a lot, which is really fascinating to look at. Characters have various different heights they can manifest in simply through their position of power. The show is often very detailed in what it shows in the background, as well. There are so many funny details being shoved into the back of the show that I believe it will warrant a great re-watch. These details show just how much Trigger cared about what they are creating. This is a passion project through-and-through. Much like the themes in the show, this ability to embrace the flaws makes them positives, which is a wholly unique approach I can\u2019t help but praise. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Audio]\\n\\n\r\nThe music is yet another standout element to Kill la Kill. This show may have the best OST I\u2019ve heard in anime so far. While both intro and credits songs aren\u2019t all too interesting, in my opinion, where this show more than makes up for this is in the wonderful backing tracks that are played throughout the show. Specifically, Nui Harime, a character introduced later in the show has a spectacularly eerie and bad-ass theme song that exemplifies her character perfectly. Ragyou also has, what I want to call the best theme song out of any character I\u2019ve ever heard in anime. Her song, Blumenkranz, is a Japanese sung German track that not only draws further parallels to fascism, but also sounds epic and suitably vocal to the kind of sadistic character she is.\\n\\n\r\nOther audio elements are naturally impressive as well. The crisp whizzing of bullets, or whatever the show uses as bullets, whether it is needles or money, to the thundering explosions are all well-mixed and never quiet enough to be un-impactful. The show also utilizes a lot of sound effects, mostly for comedy, which thankfully are about as over-the-top as the show itself. Much like in something like Avatar:The last Airbender, the sound effects went from annoying to endearing just as my enjoyment of the characters increased. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Eventual Mistakes]\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show is overall amazing, that doesn\u2019t exempt it from various issues that spring up. Thankfully, none of them are too major, however, they are worth mentioning. One of the biggest issues with having an OP and ED that aren\u2019t too great, in my opinion, is that they can create some tonal whiplash. Especially the second ED is especially strange, as it is when the shows stakes become increased, the ED is strangely light-hearted and poppy. The cliff-hanger endings aren\u2019t backed up well by the eventual ED coming in which, as I said, creates a sort of whiplash that shifts the portrayed emotions too quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few scenes where the show ventures into self-aware territory that don\u2019t feel earned. A few moments where they call out the monologuing that is done in many anime without actually subverting the scene. It is that \u201chaving the cake and eating it too\u201d aspect that annoys me in a lot of meta-dialogue in many different anime that I\u2019ve seen. There isn\u2019t any subversion happening. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, the ending few episodes play out a lot like both many shounen anime, and like Gurren Lagann, another show that studio Trigger worked on. While I found myself enjoying Kill la Kill more overall, the striking similarities sometimes felt inadvertent, which created an odd sense of treading water. While the investment in these characters made these final episodes palatable and competent, even if the cinematic nature of it wasn\u2019t overly interesting to me. Once again, the characters elevated what is being shown.  \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nClothes versus humanity. A strange topic to be sure. Kill la Kill mixes self-aware dialogue with overt indulgence with its genres clich\u00e9s. This show has a lot of smart themes hidden within its silly dialogue and sillier set pieces that will, without a doubt, go unnoticed by many of its audience there for the action or comedy. Kill la Kill\u2019s ability to keep some if its more narratively intriguing characters not morally obvious is the show\u2019s most interesting part. The viewers gradual understanding of the shows initial antagonist is crucial to developing your own sense of sympathy and connection with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of narrative hints and, honestly, surprisingly subtle storytelling to be seen. Another, less obvious theme being the removal of purity, portrayed by sexual deviance and overt hedonism. A viewer wouldn\u2019t find this meaning unless they are searching for it, which makes the eventual realization that it is being portrayed all the more rewarding. Conceptually, a lot of the shounen I\u2019ve seen now feel tepid compared to Kill la Kill. This show\u2019s superb character design and characterization keeps everyone you meet instantly memorable. Even our protagonist, Ryuuko, is often shown as someone that isn\u2019t necessarily meant to be agreed with. Not in the usual context, too, which is often just naivety. While her arc isn\u2019t as interesting as her rival, Satsuki\u2019s, it most definitely does enough to put her up there with some of the more engaging leads within Shounen anime. Her relationship with Senketsu and Mako is great, as well. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill may be seen as overly farcical, absurd, and too fast-paced for many, however, the positives of this series put it in the pantheon of some of the best anime I\u2019ve seen. Its ability to be thematically poignant while still delivering high-octane action that is completely in-line with what you\u2019d usually see in shounen action, even if it is stylistically superior in just about every way, is what leads me to believe that Kill la Kill is the perfect example of what shounen can be. It has what many similar anime don\u2019t have. Characters which are endlessly more interesting due to their dramatic depth and ability to not moralize just about everything being shown. Kill la Kill harbors self-awareness not just in the humor, but in the entire concept. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea that something must be sexualized to be marketable is this show's greatest indulgence. However, it still manages to comment on the concept as well. In one specific moment, Ragyou observes how the hardest demographic to dominate is the teen one, referring to how she is proceeding to take over the world with clothes. The lack of clothes attracts the teenagers. Maybe the show is playing the villain here. Maybe it is the hedonistic force that it criticizes, as well as promotes the idea of body positivity and sex. It draws a distinct line between what is human and what is clothes, clothes being the idea of something made. Something used by humans to control. The lack of clothes used to attract. Whatever meaning you can siphon from this is your own, but just the fact that it is there is impressive to me. In an industry where light meta-jokes are the norm and the inability to fully criticize something without doing it yourself is rampant. Kill la Kill dons another kind of appearance. One of embracing the indulgence and creating something new in an industry full of old, worn, and ragged ideas. \\n",

            "content": "Why can't stories be fun anymore? Why must a majority of shows and books be washed with dark themes and tones? Now I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some darker stories. Hell, some of my favorites, in and out of anime, are rather dark themselves. But what makes those stories good in the first place is the high quality of writing that brought out the potential of the darker themes and tones. After all, the dark stories that lack actual writing talent almost always turn out abysmal. Likewise, it seems that the majority of the stories we get nowadays that attempt tobe fun are riddled with groan-worthy jokes, the same repeated plot in different form, and the attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the tits and ass crowd. But it's not like this is new. For years, it's been like this. Yet, every now and then, we get a truly fun show that towers over the rest. When School Days plagued us with it's hate-filled contrivance, we had Baccano to combat it. When Air Gear tortured us with an onslaught of ecchi and stupidity, we had Ouran High School Host Club to show them how it's really done. So, when shows like Diabolik Lovers and the return of Valvrave the Liberator were upon us, and Samurai Flamenco failed us, who would step up to the plate to show what it truly meant to have fun? It's time, for Kill la Kill. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins in the future of, what appears to be, an alternative world to ours. In this world, Nazi Germany won the war, or at least it's implied, and Fascism reins supreme. In Japan, there lies Honnouji Academy, ruled by it's iron-fisted student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin. At Honnouji, the students are divided by rank, in the form of stars, and your social class reflects the amount of stars you have. Not only that, but the higher ranked students are given specialized uniforms, known as Goku uniforms, that enhance their own physical abilities, with the highest ranked students having the most powerful uniforms. One day, this organized society has a wrench thrown in it's works when a girl wielding a scissor blade, named Ryuko Matoi, enrolls in Honnouji, looking for answers involving her fathers murder. As she spends more time at Honnouji, her path crosses with Satsuki Kiryuin, she partners up with a living sailor uniform named Senketsu, and finds a friend in the schools nut job, Mako Mankanshoku. But as she goes deeper into the conspiracies, she's forced to confront the one thing she's been searching for this whole time. The truth. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell by the description, one thing you can't call Kill la Kill is unoriginal. What you can call it weird, crazy, over the top, eccentric, and silly among other things. But one thing that I rarely hear anyone call Kill la Kill, is smart. In fact, many people often describe it as mindless or stupid. I find this kind of sad considering that Kill la Kill is, in fact, smarter than many people will give it credit for. Kill la Kill is, in fact an allegory. For those who don't know, an allegory is an extended metaphor with hidden meaning, conveyed through characters and symbols. For reference, some other examples of allegories in anime are Wolf's Rain and Revolutionary Girl Utena. Kill la Kill often provides scenes, actions, and symbols that are meant to represent different forms of control, fascism being the obvious one, but others including indoctrination, traditionalist bigotry, and plutocracy, and these are shown to paint a picture of the conformist dictatorship that the world, or at least Japan, has submitted to. I'm actually surprised that many will write this off, considering that the symbolism and metaphor in Kill la Kill is some of the most blatant that i've ever come across. \\n\\n\r\nYes, Kill la Kill is smart and clever, but it's in no way deep or complex, and you don't have to work all that much to find meaning in it. But that's not really a bad thing, because the show is still meaningful in just how sincere it is in its endeavors. The ideas are simple and the writing is straightforward, but it's all done incredibly well. But it's not exactly necessary for you to notice these touches, because the show is so fun that you can enjoy it regardless. Yes the action, which can be best described as visual insanity, the humor, which is downright silly in the best way, and the ideas, which you should already be able to tell are strange and creative, is just so enjoyable that it's hard to not end an episode, particularly the later episodes, feeling starry-eyed and wanting more. Sadly this isn't true from start to finish. The show gets off to a rather weak start, with plenty of info dumping and cliches tossed left and right in the first episode. But it continues to improve with each episode, until the epic climax that made my jaw hurt from the giant grin I was wearing the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is brought to us by the good people at studio Trigger, the new anime studio that was founded by former Gainax employees, and it also serves as their first televised series. Before I can actually talk about the animation quality of the show though, I have to talk about the director. The director, and co-founder of Trigger, Hiroyuki Imaishi was best known for his directorial works on Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt, and the massive success known as Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann. His style often consists of grand scale settings, over the top action scenes, and just plain insanity that borders on nonsensical, and I have to say, I think Kill la Kill probably accomplished his style better than any of his other past shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch when it needs to be, but often needs to cut corners. However it's hard to take points off for this when they cut corners in all the right places, to the point where the untrained eye might not even notice the drop in quality to begin with. When the animation does decide to shine though, it's truly a visual marvel, making for some top notch actions scenes. There's plenty of detail put into this show too. It might take a little while to notice it, but there is always something going on on-screen, whether it be simple visual gags, or just little subtle touches that make a scene just a bit more prominent. You can tell there was a lot of time and care put into the visuals of this show.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, anyone's who's watched Kill la Kill, or even just knows a little about it, knows that you can't talk about the visuals without bringing up the f-word. Fanservice. Yes, Kill la Kill has scantily clad girls in it, sometimes even fully naked women in it. However, I don't see this as a flaw. Putting aside for a second that the fanservice is actually a plot point and connects to the shows themes both symbolically and metaphorically, I'm being completely serious, there are still two reasons why I will defend it. First, one look at the character designs should tell you, this fanservice is meant to look silly not sexy. The character designs are very cartoonish, with hardly any detail put into their, well, assets, and there is no attempt to make them look like wank bait. Second, even if you don't agree with my first point, I should point out that Kill la Kill has an equal amount of manservice. Yes for every half naked girl, there is a fully naked guy showing off his buff body. So, at the very least, you can't accuse the show of only trying to appeal to a certain audience. The only fanservice scenes I have issue with are the ones between Satsuki and her mother Ragyo. I understand that it's supposed to represent Ragyo showing dominance through sexuality, which is certainly nothing new, and that they were intended to be creepy, which actually works in a way. But there was no need to have 4 entire scenes of Ragyo molesting her daughter. Even so, that's just four scenes compared to 24 entire episodes. Kill la Kill, while not dazzling or progressive in it's visuals, still proves itself to be a visual marvel in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAYYYYY!!\u201d- Before My Body Is Dry\\n\\n\r\nEvery good anime needs a good OST to deliver in the context of the show it's accompanying. So for Kill la Kill's soundtrack to be good, we'd need it to be over-the-top, insane, somewhat cheesy, diverse, loud, and unforgettable. Luckily Hiroyuki Sawano, the show's composer, does not fail to deliver. There's a certain charm to the shows soundtrack that only grows on you further and further as they smartly place the most blood-pumping and spine-chilling songs at the most excessive parts of the show's action scenes and the most thrilling parts of the shows turns. From the stupidly awesome Til My Body Is Dry, to the subdued I Want To Know, and of course the fan favorite, the soft yet chilling German aria, Blumencranz. It's no surprise that the OST has even seen stateside success with Aniplex's release of it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, there is no dub as of this review, though there will certainly be one at a later date, so there isn't too much to say. As for the quality of the Japanese track, it's excessive, it's hammy, and it's impressionable. In other words, it fits the show perfectly. I admit, and I've said this before in the past, it's a bit hard for a non-japanese speaker like me to fully judge a japanese performance, but it's clear that the seiyu of the show were able to deliver a passionate performance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNot making sense is kind of our thing\u201d- Ryuko Matoi\\n\\n\r\nI've said before in the past that, at times, simplicity can work better than complexity. Sometimes, all a character needs is to be well-defined and engaging. In that sense, Kill la Kill passes with flying colors. Most, if not all, of the shows characters start off as the haggard old archetypes we've seen a million times before. Ryuko is the hotheaded rebel, Satsuki is the prideful ice queen, Mako is the out of this world best friend/comic relief, Senketsu is a blood-sucking sailor uniform........okay maybe not all of the characters are haggard old archetypes. But what sets them apart from their archetypes, is that every character in this show has purpose, both to the story and to themselves. Each is written with unique motivations, goals, and flaws that make the cast far more fleshed out then I thought was possible when I started the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis is only furthered by the show's theme of individuality. Yes, as a primarily teenage cast living in a conformist dictatorship, each of them are bound to, at some point, question who they really are, what they want in life, and how they live their lives. Every character, either before or during the events of the show, goes through this journey that ends up defining them and their role. It's this that turns Ryuko from the hotheaded rebel to someone who craves a sense of identity,  Mako from a comic relief to an emotional anchor, Senketsu, who I remind you is a blood-sucking sailor uniform, to one of the most lovable characters of the show and Satsuki goes from a prideful ice queen to spoiler spoiler and more spoilers. Even outside of the main cast we have memorable characters like the muscle bound, yet surprisingly moe, Ira Gamagoori, the theatrical and attention-grabbing Aikurou Mikisugi, and then there's Nui Harime. Oh Nui, you cutesy, detestable, little troll you. Her words are like nails on a chalkboard, her presence is like a shadow looming over a playground, and by the end of the series you will want her to die a slow painful death. My god, did I enjoy having her around. Yes, all that I just said is true, but she just has such charm to her, you can't help but love to hate her, maybe even just love her period for just how much deadly fun she is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's just a certain charm that comes with all of these crazy, strange, nonsensical, and wholly loveable characters coming together to create one giant family of awesome, while simultaneously saving the world. The characters of Kill la Kill, don't have much depth, except for perhaps Ryuko and Satsuki, but they don't necessarily need it. They're familiar, yet distinctive, likeable, and unforgettable, and sometimes that's all a show needs to have a great cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10) (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you told me after I watched the first episode of Kill la Kill that it would end up being one of my favorite shows, I would have to think that you knew next to nothing about what I enjoy in anime.  But lo and behold, I am writing an extremely positive review of the show and declaring it one of my new favorites. There's been a little joke ever since Kill la Kill was announced, even before it aired, that Kill la Kill was \u201csaving anime\u201d made mostly by people who wanted to mock the idea of over-hyping shows, and yet ironically only ended up hyping it even more. Do I agree with this idea, no. Anime doesn't need saving, despite my jesting in the opening paragraph, and hype is something that shouldn't be considered when judging any type of work because what's important is what's right in front of you. So what do you get from Kill la Kill? One of the most fun anime i've seen in a while that manages to be well-written and full of heart. I can't, with good conscience, give it a perfect score, but that does not stop me from adoring it as much as I do. It's a show that may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend checking it out nonetheless. Anyways that's all for now. Til next time.",

            "content": "Don't lose your WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY\r\nOkay, with that out of the way.\r\nIn your MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND\r\nSorry.\r\nI have a LOT of admiration for this show. Given, I see some issues with it, but I also see some great aspects as well. Please, if I begin gushing, feel free to slap me.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story's alright. It's Gurren Lagann with clothes. Start of with one villain, who just wants to oppress. Overcome villain. Find new villain who wants to completely enslave humanity. Explosions ensue. The premise is pretty goofy, but hey, sometimes it's nice to appreciate the goofy. One issue I do have is the obsession with fanservice in this show. It'sstarts off well enough, a symbol of putting aside personal shame for the sake of achieving goals, but after about episode 3 or 4, it just seems to be fanservice for fanservice's sake.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art here is all over the place. Sometimes, we get over the top fight scenes, with swords clashing hundreds of times a second, explosions everywhere, and people falling from the sky. Other times, we get a still character moving across a still background. It's quite jarring actually, but if you can get past it, this show can be eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice acting, both sub and dub, are done quite well. I personally prefer sub, as Satsuki just sounds all the more intimidating, but preferences. The music is a LOAD of fun, from fitting character themes, to Blumenkranz, to Before My Body is Dry.\\n\\n\r\nWE HAVE TO BEEEEEEEEEEEE AS OOOOOOOOOOONE\\n\r\n*slap*\\n\\n\r\nThank you. All in all, this show's just fun to listen to, and I can advise looking up the soundtrack. You'll have fun. I promise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters MAKE this show. Well, and one other aspect, but I'll cover that in the next section. Ryuko and Satsuki are brilliant, and Satsuki even graces my favorite characters list. Ryuko is strong-willed, hot-headed, and rather foolish. However, she sticks to her guns, if not her morals. She never gives up throughout the series, and because of her stubbornness, she ends up growing quite a bit as a character. She's not perfect by any means, but she's fun. Satsuki however... The woman is  intimidating, domineering, stoic, inspirational, COMPLETELY goal-oriented, and forever a joy on the screen. Plus, girl got good eyebrow game.\\n\r\nThe other characters are okay. Not bad, but maybe not amazing. Mako was quite funny at times. Ragyou was a character you just LOVED to hate. The Elite Four pinged off of each other well. Senketsu was actually one of my least favorite characters. He's not BAD, but he never stood out to me too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt's not a ten because of the aforementioned fanservice. However, I'd like to posit that Kill la Kill is a  BRILLIANT satire. It starts off simply making fun of the magical girl genre. Eh. Then, it makes fun of the anime high school setting (get it? because the school LITERALLY determines the living conditions of these people : high school is life) But that's not the true  brilliance. Over the top explanations of attacks, to the point where I sometimes felt that the characters were staring at the camera, those cheeky jerks. Mikisugi is a parody of Sosuke Aizen (he pulls off his glasses, and his personality and hair drastically change). Ragyou is a parody/homage to Gendo (have you seen her office). Isshin Matoi is a parody of dead anime fathers (seriously, how he treated her was terrible. Why would she fight to avenge him? Because the plot demands it, Kasigah!) And then there's the compilation episode. My gosh. This... this is the greatest moment in anime history. I won't spoil it too much, but this is an episode that you must watch. I believe it's episode 18 or so, though I don't remember. Seriously, stop reading this. Go watch the compilation episode and come back. I'll wait.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is a barrel of fun. If you can't stand fanservice, I can't recommend it, but if you think you can handle it, please watch this show. It's not the \"Savior of Anime\" that so many believed, but boy does it have high points.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is one of those shows that my friends adore the shit out of that I'm incapable of getting on with. How could this be, though? I'm a huge fan of Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill was made by the same blokes who created the former and for what it's worth, the show really does retain the same sort of fun atmosphere Gurren Lagann had. Unfortunately, that sort of fun atmosphere isn't enough to actually make me like this show. Whereas Gurren Lagann had me cheering on all the senseless stupidity that was going on, Kill la Kill didn't really have mecheering on much of anything. In fact, Kill la Kill got pretty grating after a short while and it's basically what soured my overall impressions of Trigger as a studio and given their track record as of late, I don't think I'll ever get on with them.\\n\\n\r\nAll of my gripes with Kill la Kill boil down to three simple problems:\\n\\n\r\n1) It's functionally identical to Gurren Lagann\\n\\n\r\nThis was basically what turned me off of Kill la Kill for the most part. I understand that the bulk of the staff working on Kill la Kill were the ones that made Gurren Lagann, but that's no excuse to rehash the same type of over-the-top stupidity from one show into another. Really, was it such a monumental effort on the part of the production studio to come up with something original? Whenever I watch an episode of Kill la Kill, I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my time watching this show because Gurren Lagann does exactly what Kill la Kill does and does it significantly better. Why is this? Well for starters, it's not shoving shitty self-parody down my throat half the time. That actually brings me to the next gripe:\\n\\n\r\n2) The self-aware humour was EXTREMELY grating\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I'm beginning to despise self-aware shows mostly because of the fact that it seems like any show that came out within the last few years basically point out all of their problems without doing anything funny with what they bring up. In other words, all they're doing is saying \"Hey, look at this thing we did! It's so stupid, right? Laugh, damn you!\" Whenever Kill la Kill makes a self-aware joke, it takes me out of my bubble and reminds me that what I'm watching is stupid and I could be watching something better. You see, the biggest reason as to why I enjoy shows like Code Geass and Gurren Lagann boil down to the fact that everything is so hyperbolic and ridiculously cool to the point where I'm too wrapped up in my own enjoyment of the programme to realise what I'm watching is stupid. Whenever Kill la Kill comes close to making me forget that what I'm watching is stupid, there has to be a goddamn self-aware joke thrown in because they did this stupid thing and they want me to know that they're aware they did this stupid thing and that I should laugh because it's so stupid. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't make me laugh because it tells me that Trigger is doing is stupid, they KNOW what they're doing is stupid, but they're still doing it anyway. This isn't to say that self-aware humour is inherently bad, because it's something that's actually pretty funny if the guys making the show know how to make a self-aware joke funny. If you want a good idea of something that does the whole self-aware shtick properly, just watch an episode of Ouran HSHC, Dave the Barbarian, Sheep in the Big City, Ed Edd n Eddy, Chowder, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, or one of the classic Looney Tunes shorts (like Duck Amuck). Studios like Trigger irritate the shit out of me because they're ruining self-aware comedy just because they're too lazy to actually come up with a funny joke. Well, I guess the self-aware humour isn't as big a thorn in my side as all the fan service.\\n\\n\r\n3) The fan service got downright nauseating for me\\n\\n\r\nSay what you will about Gurren Lagann and how they handled Yoko, but the fan service in Gurren Lagann was tame enough to the point where I could look past it and focus more on the story at hand. Unfortunately, the story at hand in Kill la Kill is all about the fan service. Before you say anything, Kill la Kill is NOT a parody of fan service and if it actually was a parody, it's even worse than it was before. The lacklustre comedy and the fact that it's a cheap imitation of Gurren Lagann make it mediocre on its own. If this were actually meant to be a parody or a satire of fan service in anime, that brings this show down even more. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does nothing to subvert expectations and instead opts to use fan service like Ikkitousen or Queen's Blade does. THANKFULLY, Kill la Kill is nowhere near as obscene as the former two but it does get rather close at times. I get it, Ryuko and Satsuki are hot. There is NO need to shove their half-naked bodies and damn-near exposed breasts down my throat for 75% of every episode. As much as I like my daily dose of animated girls exposing their skin, there's a limit to how much I can enjoy before it stops being enticing and ends up becoming repulsive.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all of that in mind, there is one question that has must be answered: did Kill la Kill truly save anime? No, it's more of the same pandering shlock that's been polluting anime at large for the last several years in a different coat of paint. You know, Trigger could've gone ahead and created something that was actually worthwhile like the anime equivalent of a show like Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, or Adventure Time: you know, shows that appeal to all ages and are fun to watch whilst also tackling darker and deeper themes. Unfortunately, they decided to rehash the same shit that they did before (whilst working under a different studio) and judging by their current offerings now like Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer, it's obvious that pathetic comedies are the only thing they're capable of making. Say what you will about Gainax, but at least they've got more variety to their roster.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Kill La Kill: it made my head hurt, but not because it's terrible, rather because it's one heck of a ride. It likes to be over the top and it will show. I decided to watch it because there was a big hype around it and saying goes that it was a very interesting show. So I watched it, thus my review:\r\nSTORY:\r\nI'd split it in two parts: the plot which you can kind of tell from the premise and the second part which...is not so foreseeable.\r\nThe first part consists of Ryuuko searching for her father's murderer and the secrets around it. For that, she needsto get to Satsuki and that also means defeating other people in Ryuuko's way. The plot shows progress as she has to fight the Four Devas in hope she can get her hands on Satsuki. And at the end, she does get what she wanted but not in the way she imagined it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd suddenly, second half of the plot begins and we come from mere revenge and unraveling her father's death to saving the world. The second half feels a bit detached from the initial premise and at first I was really startled by it but I thought I'd go along and see where the plot takes me. 2nd half makes some sense but it's undermined by some issues.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say that the first half is far better than the second half. Not only because of the plot but for other reasons which come reviewing the other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art style is really something. You will quickly realize how over the top Kill La Kill really is just by the art style alone. Sometimes like an 90's anime, sometimes very modern but it never feels chaotic or stressful for the eyes. It's very pleasant and I'm happy to say that it's indeed as unique and well executed as I've heard from the hype surrounding Kill La Kill.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'll talk about the fanservice.\\n\r\nIf you dislike fanservice quickly, this show will be hard for you. It is very heavy on it. It also has plot reasons but nevertheless it comes out as fanservice most of the time. Ryuuko's finishing attack tears the clothes of her opponents completely. The transformations (and the result of them) are also fanservice and other things too, but the most comes from these two things.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I was forgetting that the girls fight in fanservice-y outfits but at times, it was unaviodable because of the camera angles and other things. For what it is, the fanservice does look good and it shows how flexible the art direction of the show can be. Sometimes however, it distracted me and that isn't that beneficial.\\n\\n\r\nThat some aspects of the show are a double-edged sword is pretty common. And the fan service is one point of it. But otherwise, the style is great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI like the songs during action scenes, they are good. A small variation most of the time but it was good. Opening and Ending Songs are nothing special to me, I can't comment that much about it. Not my type of music, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are mostly good, I just get annoyed by Nonon and Nui at times. Nonon just a few times but Nui's voice is something I don't like to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nRyuuko is kind of a typical character, just in female. However, I like her gutsy character and that she doesn't flinch at the slightest sight of danger. Strong-willed characters like her are really likable in my opinion. Concerning development a bit lacking but nevertheless a good character.\\n\\n\r\nMako and her family...oh boy, that's a tough bunch of characters to write about. It's hit-or-miss. And it that case, they missed me after a 1/4 of the series. The antics of them aren't bad but they become stale quickly. Especially Ryuuko's \"friend\" or depending on how you see it, tag-along Mako.\\n\\n\r\nShe isn't only a comic relief but also a Deus Ex Machina at times. Considering that these happen because of her climax- and atmosphere-breaking comical behavior, she became a really annoying character in my eyes. Her character does progress a bit but her comical relief parts just come at such bad times that it spoilt my mood several times during action scenes. And this happens often enough.\\n\\n\r\nHer personality is missing me too. She's played as an airhead, often missing the point or serious atmosphere around her and it can be funny, but it can also be annoying. For me, it tended toward the latter. The rest of the family is pretty one-note.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Ryuuko's homeroom teacher who will become relevant for the plot but I found him annoying after a few episodes because his jokes become stale too. Also hit-and-miss.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki is the antagonist and as she's the Student Council President, different but kinda the same like Ryuuko: she's also strong-willed, has an iron fist when it comes to showing her resolve, has a cold exterior and so on: you can see why Ryuuko wants to fight her so badly.\\n\r\nBut inside, she's also caring for her other companions in the Student Council, you'll see that coming as the plot progresses. I liked her the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe Four Devas (Satsuki's companions in the Student Council) also have personalities. Sometimes they behave very one-note or stereotypical but the over-the-topness of the series makes them still shine. The conversations among themselves were also interesting in my opinion but they were sparse at times.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the characters you will most often see and to avoid spoilers, I cannot reveal more characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThe plot of Kill La Kill has some twists here and there. One was foreshadowed and while it was predictable to me, I really liked it as the plot progress was pushing me to disbelieve in a certain possible plot twist. However, the plot twists so often that it ties itself a knot and a few plotholes and missing background on certain characters, especially in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a sensible amount of plot twists I can stomach. And then there is the amount that leaves you in disbelief. Not because a twist is awesome, more because it makes you think: \"WHAT?! WHY?!\". Unfortunately, Kill La Kill goes for the latter. They weren't needed in that amount and the plot would be more enjoyable if it wouldn't want to twist itself so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the fanservice is relevant to the plot. And there I'm not sure whether I should take seriously what Kill La Kill is going for or not. Even more with the comedic moments (like Mako's mood-breaking antics). Some are well-placed, others not and it can confuse people that the show cannot focus entirely on what it wants to be or where it wants to go.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the second half also dampened my enjoyment with unnessecary fanservice where I thought multiple times: \"That's some bad touch there\". The first half was tamer with it and I liked it, even if fanservice was a bit plenty at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut the art style, over-the-top antics and general mood combined with the action scenes are really refreshing. At times, it can make you forget the grief you have with annoying characters or gratitious fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nKill La Kill isn't bad. It does some things right and other things not. You can feel that the series is style over substance and it shows. The style is great, the substance mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko (and her cloth Senketsu that I like but isn't that outstanding) and Satsuki are totally fine by me. The Four Devas also, Nonon a little less but still fine.\\n\\n\r\nFor Mako and her family, Ryuuko's homeroom teacher and many other characters you'll encounter, especially on the evil side...hit-or-miss. For me, they were a miss.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Mako and her family enough, you can add +1 to the overall score. If you like Mr. Homeroom Teacher, +0.5.\\n\\n\r\nEven with such a low rating on enjoyment, it's definitely worth a watch since Kill La Kill is indeed a heck of a ride and experience gained.",

            "content": "This is Kill la Kill. This is the anime where hype is the definition of anime itself, where fanservice creates action and where music circulates the blood (pun alert) in your body into a powered-up mechanism of sprawling adrenaline. \r\nBeing created by the makers of the highly acclaimed and recognized Gurren Lagann and FLCL, Kill la Kill is brought by the newly formed Studio Trigger. Kill la Kill tells the tale of Ryuuko Matoi, a vagrant school girl wayfaring from location to location who's raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to search for clues behind the mysterious truth of her father\u2019s death. Wielding a scissor-sword, Matoi arrives toHonnouji Academi to look for her father\u2019s assassinator. However, this is where the journey truly begins as standing in her way is the Student Council President, also known as Kiryin Satsuki as well as her personal four divas, or more commonly referred to as the Elite Four of the academy. Along the journey, Ryuuko finds beneath her house, Senketsu, a Kamui which is an outfit in which the host is provided with near god-like abilities in exchange for their blood. This power gives her the opportunity to overcome her enemies, hindrances in her journey for finding the answers she wants. \\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Kill la Kill, it is vital that the audience understands the fact that the laws of physics, common sense and logic does not apply in this show. This show de facto requires you to turn off your thinking caps and your brain itself, because if you decide to decipher and analyze this show intrinsically, you will find countless amounts of flaws and problems. Hell, you can even say that Kill la Kill has its own laws of physics and definition of common sense. Despite having a predictable plot at the start, the execution is what makes Kill la Kill stand out alongside Gurren Lagann.  Every episode contributes to the overall plot and there is little to no filler, even so if there is filler, it would not really be considered filler as in Kill la Kill, they develop intricate relationships between our characters and grow bonds of brotherhood, kinship, fraternity and solidarity. Exaggeration is brought out to the utmost extremes and this is where the hyped-up and epic action derive from. \\n\\n\r\nIn the early stages, Kill la Kill\u2019s visuals may seem a tad deterring and lacking from the average modern eye-candy anime viewer. It utilizes a range of colours and a firmly toned set of strong outlines to refurnish the fact that logic does not exist within the anime, thus brings out an art style similar to the chaotic. Studio Trigger manages to take short turns and exploit the animation aspect to the degree where some scenes are extended with single frames longer than usual. Giant red text is presented here and there to furthermore add to the epic explosive action and over-the-top, unconstitutional and unorthodox setting and ambiance of the show itself. \\n\\n\r\nHaving the main characters being females, Matoi is depicted as the archetype of fortitude, the paradigm of grandness and the epitome of any strong women. Not only does she stand for herself, but after enduring suffering, adversity and defeat for countless amounts of times, the word \u2018giving up\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to be in her dictionary. You can even say that Studio Trigger is trying to promote equality right now and right here if you look deeply, rather than shallowly. Members of the main cast are diverse and each have their own unique backstories told, for the Elite Four, throughout the first cour of the series, the tale of how they met Satsuki is told as well as why they deeply respect and honour Satsuki as the President. Comedy is also embedded into the characters, such as Mako, arguably the comic relief as well as utilizing comedy within the Elite Four to ultimately make them likable. Satsuki, playing the role of the villain is portrayed as the paradigm of badassness and being fierce as she is, she is the reason for the continued development and bringing of Matoi\u2019s perseverance and indomitability of the human spirit. With underlying and hidden ulterior motives, Satsuki utilizes Matoi to the full extent and eventually develops Matoi as a character. There is also a depiction of the theme of family within Kill la Kill and is heavily emphasized on. Spending time with Mako and her family ultimately develops Matoi as a person as well and allows her to experience what she does not have, a family. Likewise, Mako besides being a comedy aspect in the show is also another reason for Matoi\u2019s growth. As time passes, their time spent together acts as ingredients of amalgamation into developing Matoi\u2019s personality as she shows care towards the family and even fights for their sake, especially during the episode where they were captivated by material interests and money. Another prime character would be Senketsu, her sailor uniform. He acts as voice of conscience and reason whenever Matoi goes overboard or is emotionally hurt, he provides advice when he can. \\n\\n\r\nThe music? ITS EPIC.ITS GOOD. AND ITS AMAZING. This might even be an understatement at this point. The music is abundant and has a diverse range of tracks used throughout the 24 episodes. Composed by Hiroyuki Sawano who also composed music for well-recognized shows including Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, the soundtrack is outstanding and simply makes the show even grand than it already is. Sawano produces music of excellence that is addictive and energetic in order to get the audiences\u2019 body moving and blood pumping. Kill la Kill also used euphonious, emotional and sympathetic music such as \u2018I Want To Know\u2019 during emotion provoking scenes. Joyous scenes also utilize music such as \u2018Light Your Heart Up\u2019 at the most appropriate times. Now to the action scenes, one of the most memorable soundtracks used would of course include the popular \u2018Before My Body Is Dry\u2019 or more well known for its tagline \u201cDON\u2019T LOSE YOUR WAYYYY\u201d.  This track is used throughout the course of the 24 episodes predominantly during action scenes when Matoi does something especially badass and where \u2018epic\u2019 is the only word you can bring your mouth to say. Ironically enough, she loses her way invariably but this is what develops her as a character. This track is arguably used a bit too repetitively some say, but I personally opine that it\u2019s what makes action scenes have its own essence. Another action based track used would include \u2018Suck Your Blood\u2019 which fits especially well during adrenaline packed action scenes. In addition, \u2018Sanbika\u2019 sang by Aoi Eir, is another addictive and energetic track that would get you on the edge of your seat. Both openings, \u2018Sirius\u2019 by Aoi Eir and \u2018Ambiguous\u2019 by GARNIDELIA prepares you with eagerness and anticipation for what you are going to experience in the subsequent episode, it can be best described as a catalyst to amaze and make the episode shine even more. Both endings are also used decently as closures for the episodes more notably during the final 2 episodes as a calm remedy for the audience to recuperate from all the sheer action taken place. Other memorable tacks include Satuski\u2019s dictator-like badass theme as well as Nui Harime\u2019s theme.\\n\\n\r\nBy this time you would probably be wondering why \u2018Blumenkranz\u2019 isn\u2019t mentioned yet. Well, it deserves its own little paragraph you see. \u2018Blumenkranz\u2019 is used throughout the series as a villain theme and has been one of the best villain themes I have ever heard. It adds on to the entertainment value of the series and is definitely one of the most memorable tracks of KLK. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, every episode brings out anticipation pumping and circulating your \u2018blood\u2019 (pun alert) to its zenith. Kill la Kill definitely excels at the enjoyment aspect and every episode plays out to its pinnacle and despite the simple plot, the execution is brought out perfectly. The characters are likable and all have their own inherent worth and value while the animation despite being seemingly poor with a low budget, is utilized amazingly. The sheer epic-ness of the anime alone is enough of a reason to rewatch the show any day, any time and even anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are you doing? Go watch Kill la Kill now and get your body movin!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "It's been said by many veteran anime watchers that anime is dying. In the old days we had our Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Wolf's Rain, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Akira, FLCL, Berserk, Fist of the North Star, and Miyazaki; we had Space Captain Harlock, Lupin the Third, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Ghost in the Shell. Even if you haven't seen these, you've likely at least heard of them and the impact that they've had on anime as a whole. Anime was an intellectual, creative medium that reflected flair and pizzazz. It wasn't just silly entertainment for kids, like many Western cartoons, and people of all ages couldenjoy it. As of late it seems that anime has been stuck in a rut of moe, harems, rom-coms with unrealistically dense male MC\u2019s, and onii-chan/imouto obsessive garbage. Lately there's been a lack of courage to sack up, step outside of the box, and say, \"Hey, let's try something new.\" After you peruse season after season of the same regurgitated genres you might find yourself wondering if anime has lost its way... And, to answer that question, Trigger will look down and whisper, \"No.\" \\n\\n\r\nWatching the story of Kill la Kill unfold was confusing, exhilarating, comical, lively, and goddamn refreshing. What began as a simple revenge story, with a shaky plot direction, overabundance of fan-service, and obnoxiously flashy fight scenes, ended in a surprisingly competent and satisfying fashion. Although Kill la Kill is entertaining, it is still a series that prioritizes style more than substance. This isn\u2019t to say that the series is shallow in the slightest, but it\u2019s often difficult to overlook the abundance of panty shots, suffocatingly tight and revealing outfits, the FLCL-esque action, and all their allure. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a lot of wild enjoyment to be had in Kill la Kill, it's also easy to disregard what makes this series so brilliant. Part of the genius behind Kill la Kill is the fact that the show itself is a parody of many overused tropes in recent anime. Over-sexualized, provocative clothing and fan-service for no reason? Check. Student council is overpowered? Check. School system that emphasizes uniforms? Check. Story about revenge? Also check. Not only does the series poke fun at commonalities in anime, it also fires shots at the oppressive nature of the Japanese education system. The most astounding part about all of this is that Kill la Kill doesn't just adhere to the common tropes itself for shits and giggles; it actually takes these tropes and literally makes them its plot. Even if you don't take the stance on viewing the series as a parody, you'd probably still find the series entertaining and fun to watch on a different standard. That's ingenuity, ladies and gentlemen. \\n\\n\r\nTrigger did something interesting with its characters in Kill la Kill that you don\u2019t see in anime too often, adding to the fresh factor of the show.  They took a series that banks on testosterone-based, over-the-top action and made the main characters girls. It's not often that you come across an anime with a strong female lead that can not only stand up for herself, but also against tyranny and male counter parts. Ryuuko personifies these values. There\u2019s a struggle within our current modern-day society to fit in with social norms. It\u2019s tough to be that black sheep individual that goes about their own business without being judged by the majority, hence why we generally follow fashion trends, region-specific social etiquette, and so forth. The growth of Ryuuko reflects this as the development of her character is steadily shown across the span of the series. Ryuuko starts off as a bland teenage girl with attitude looking for retribution against the one who killed her father. When introduced to Senketsu \u2014 a revealing sailor uniform made of life fibers \u2014 she is submitted to humility in exchange for power. It\u2019s things like this that should make you raise an eyebrow and wonder whether or not this is reflective of the advantages and disadvantages that sexuality offers women. Maybe I\u2019m looking too much into it, or maybe I\u2019m right. What\u2019s great about Kill la Kill is that there isn't a right answer. You take from it what you want. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Ryuuko portrays big themes and intricate lessons woven into her character, it would be a crime to disregard the rest of the cast of the series. The character body of Kill la Kill is quite diverse and there are plenty of likable characters. Each character brings something to the table in terms of entertainment and, as a whole, makes sure that there\u2019s never a dull moment. Characters that are depicted as the antagonists, such as Satsuki and the Four Devas, are likeable. Mako, who is essentially the fool, is actually funny. The way these characters fit the mold of wacky, but wacky with personality, is astounding. Characters feel like they fit into the show seamlessly and that can be hard to come by. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is similar to the chaotic, yet extremely fun style that Gainax offered in both FLCL and TTGL. It\u2019s hard to ignore the resemblance when Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Ohtsuka, originally from Gainax, are now a part of Studio Trigger. The action defies logic and physics, the art is stellar, the animation is fluid, the backdrops are majestic, and all of it meshes together nicely. The sound criteria of Kill la Kill is also quite exceptional itself. The OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s are good, the OST is great, and the voice acting is on point. There\u2019s nothing else to ask for. With that being said, I think the biggest problem is that Trigger has with Kill la Kill is that while retaining the style, they also retained dips in the quality of the art and animation, similar to those in TTGL. There's a lot of repeated animated scenes, such as the Kamui change scene, the shot of the heel clicking the ground, and even sword swinging. It\u2019s not horrible or extremely detrimental to enjoyment, but it is there. The animation drops for a series as chaotic as Kill la Kill is understandable, given that Studio Trigger is also very new, and so I\u2019d take this fault with a grain of salt. \\n\\n\r\nFor Studio Trigger\u2019s first original, seasonal anime series, Kill la Kill came in and went out with a bang. While it doesn't quite hit the status of masterpiece, I\u2019ve been made a fan. I will be looking forward to whatever creativity their future works will bring.",

            "content": "Welcome to Kill la Kill. This is where fanservice is plot, style is substance and every episode plays out like the finale. This is anime.\r\nFrom the makers of FLCL, Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking, Kill la Kill is the first television production series under the newly formed Studio Trigger. Its is a tale of a transfer student, Matoi Ryuuko, wielding a scissor-sword, comes to Honnouji Academy to look for her father's killer. Opposing her is the Student Council President, Kiryin Satsuki, as well as her personal guard of the Elite Four, who are developing uniforms of immense power. After an initial fight, where Ryuukoends up being defeated, she stumbles across a sailor uniform that gives her the power to overcome her enemies and give her the answers that she seeks. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill takes all the worn-out tropes and clich\u00e9s of anime, amps it up to eleven and then delightfully invert them to give something exciting and fresh. While Ryuuko's tale of revenge is a tad predictable, it is the execution of the plot points that makes it stand out from its peers. Everything is exaggerated to the extreme including the school setting, characters, concepts to the absolutely epic action that happens. The show makes a point of never dwelling on a single event for too long and continually ups the ante in every single episode. There is little filler and the show is pretty subversive by playing with the viewer's expectations and then completely changing the outcome. When the action does slows down, there is a metric ton of references and homage to western culture ranging from Marvel Comics to classical music and literature. At the same time, Kill la Kill is mindful of its own Japanese heritage and folklore, drawing parallels to Oba Nobunaga, anime of old and new while not overly heavy-handed with its references by keeping it quick and tucked away in the background. Some elements of comedy are thrown in, complete with visual gags, puns and slapstick humor. However, a point of contention is the hit and miss nature of Mako's antics, which may not go well with every viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOn a first glance, Kill la Kill's visuals is reminiscent of cell animation at its peak during the late 1990s with its warm color palette and strong outlines. The backgrounds are drawn to the style of oil paintings and provide a epic and cinematic feel to the show instead of the drab outlines that other shows often present. In the animation department, Studio Trigger takes every possible shortcut in producing this show by utilizing extended single frames, sometimes even coming down to Inferno Cop levels. However, the style and energy placed into the visuals, more than make up for it technical shortcomings. Studio Trigger knows that this is an anime and plays around with that fact by slapping GIANT RED TEXT on everything and breaking the fourth wall constantly through changing perspectives and character proportions. Everything is presented with the force of a runaway freight train and doesn't let up until the viewer either gives in or walks away. The animation quality sometimes does take a nose dive that is too steep to ignore (Episode 4) with repetitive sequences, sloppy frames and limited motion. As well, the hilariously bad CGI in some places (I'm looking at you Episode 3), is enough to break the viewer's immersion. That being said, I applause the production team for making Kill la Kill never having a dull moment onscreen and being innovative with such a limited budget.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the explosive theatrics that is plastered all over the screen, the characters are outstanding in the way they inject themselves into the show and overarching plotline. Ryuuko's tomboyish behavior, recklessness and imaginative fighting tactics solidifies her as one of the strongest female leads I've seen in recent years. At the same time, she does get embarrassed my her scandalous-looking outfit and is vulnerable due to her past of growing up as a delinquent loner, making her feel like more of a teenager being thrown into absurd situations and less than any pre-established archetypes of a typical shouen show. Her nemesis and my personal favorite, K Satsuki, is the student council president who runs Honnouji Academy like a fascist regime and literally radiates power. Although she is on par with Ryuuko's combat power, Satsuki prefers to use her various schemes and henchmen to do her dirty work and knows more than she lets on. Bolstering the two already formidable leads, the supporting characters are very memorable in their own right with the Elite Four, the eccentric Mako, the nudist stripping homeroom teacher, and various factions duking it out. Each characters adds their own brand of wackiness into an anime that doesn't holds anything back.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (of Attack on Titan and Blue Exorcist fame) is outstanding in every aspect and holds up the show when the animation decides to takes a break. By combining genres ranging from rock, electronica, vocals, jazz and bass, Sawano creates a score that is distinctive, addictive, energetic and flows perfectly with the over-the-top nature of Kill la Kill. Some standouts includes the rock-oriented 'Before my body is dry', 'Blumenkranz ', and the disturbingly haunting theme of Harime Nui. The character voices is equally as strong as the soundtrack with Ami (Code Geass's Kallen Stadtfeld and Spice and Wolf's Holo) portraying the hot-blooded and bash Ryuuko, Yuzuki Ryouka (Air's Minagi ) as the totalitarian Satsuki and the relatively new Suzaki Aya as Mako. Opposing the main leads, Paku, Romi adds an edge of as the sadistic Kiryuuin Ragyou and Tamura Yukari (Higurashi's Rika) as the batshit-crazy psycho Harime Nui. Male leads are also excellent with their respective VAs doing exceptional work on voicing Sanageyama, Gamagoori, and the fabulous Mikisugi.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the primary draw of Kill la Kill is the sheer ludicrousy of action that happens, there is a good amount of depth in terms of the themes nudity, clothing and sexuality. The amount of nudity and fanservice shown in Kill la Kill far exceeds any typical anime, showing off asses, breasts and glowing nipples left, right and center. In fact, Ryuuko's skimpy uniform only gets more powerful when the user shreds her shame and embraces her naked self. However, more often than not, the exaggerated use of fanservice is sometime more along the lines being a parody rather than anything sexual or pandering to the audience. While other shows uses sexiness to pour gravy over the main course of the plot and characters, the nudity is interwoven into the narrative and provides context for analysis and discussion. And this is where the beauty of Studio Trigger's masterpiece lies, where it can appeals to the causal action-oriented viewer by giving them a rollercoaster ride on afterburners while layering the show for analysis and discussion for the more savvy anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nFor its first production work, it feels that this is the culmination of Studio Trigger's legacy by combining the energy and randomness of FLCL, the over-the-top nature and scale of Gurren Lagann, and sexualized content of Panty and Stocking into something very unique and very deserving of all the hype that it is given.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nTL DR:\\n\r\nSimplistic plot but perfect execution \\n\r\nCharacters that you can't help but cheer for\\n\r\nAwesome animation for such a small budget\\n\r\nCan be as shallow or deep depending on what the viewer wants the show to be\\n\r\nHigh rewatchability \\n\r\nGo watch and judge for yourself. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Witnessing the Kill la Kill hype train chugging along made me enter the show with negative expectations. The generic revenge plot, school setting and ridiculous designs left me folding my arms and rolling my eyes. It was and still is boldly proclaimed that Trigger is 'saving anime', whatever that means, but while Kill la Kill may be refreshing, is it really a cut above the rest? For better or worse, I could not help but feeling vindicated for holding my initial expectations. With the closing of the last episode, I felt I had just watched a slideshow rather than an engaging narrative.It should be stated that having a show that doesn't revolve around the banality of the fantastical construct that is 'moe' is heartening. Perhaps a narrative of personal struggle, coupled with great conflict and violence is rather cliche, but it is certainly more entertaining. Ryuuko as a character is interesting in that she isn't a flower that immediately wavers in the face of adversity or isn't immediately 'put in place' by a man. Unfortunately, that is basically all she has going for her, otherwise she is just another angst ridden teenager with a chip on her shoulder. Sure, Kill la Kill is indeed a show that not only has a strong female lead, but is dominated by powerful women, however that alone does not warrant high praise. Trigger talked of 'taking risks' but it seems Ryuuko is purposely not fleshed out to be broadly appealing. Her anger, loneliness and eventual commitment to her friends is something shared with many protagonists. \\n\\n\r\n The narrative as a whole leaves something to be desired. From episode 3 it was obvious that they couldn't draw out Ryuuko and Satsuki's clashing of heads for a whole 24 episodes. The show already heavily alludes to Satsuki as being more than what she projects. Given that this is a Japanese narrative, it is based on kish\u014dtenketsu and the plot is hinged on a twist. You think with narrative structure based on plot twists, you would go for something interesting. However, Trigger in their infinite wisdom decided to go with the generic 'I am your father' twist. While it was honestly unexpected on my part, it was still wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\n Besides that, there are jarring transitions between a more light-hearted action/comedy to more serious action/drama. I honestly fail to see why Trigger thought Mako and her family were absolutely indispensable for the narrative. While the show is already over the top, ramming in the crass antics of the Mankanshoku family amid conflict with wide reaching ramifications is on the level of Michael Bay's Transformers. What purpose does Mako even serve other than that of a pure plot device? She is that of a generic best friend character who's only defining trait are her long winded motivational rants. Her relationship with Ryuuko is an implied one, they are forced together in episode one with absolutely no development what so ever. \\n\\n\r\n Kill la Kill relies heavily on it's stylistic elements, so good action should be among one of it's hallmarks. Despite that, the quality of the fight scenes are underwhelming, as they are dependent on speed lines and characters shouting at one another. It could be said that in Kill la Kill the characters fight first and foremost with words, fists and weapons being secondary arms. While I understand that aesthetics are a matter of subjectivity, I can't leave out my conviction that most of the designs are just plain terrible. It seems all they did was take the standard Japanese school uniform and added as many spikes and stars as humanly possible. If the transformations aren't hulking masses of arbitrary geometry, than they are merely skimpy shoe laces with bulging shoulders. All in all, I can't praise Kill la Kill to high heaven, but I can't exactly hate it either. It's OST is remarkable and really propels the show where it is lacking, even if I cannot appreciate all the tracks. That said, if this is what constitutes 'saving anime', then we are truly screwed, this should be among the average, not the exceptional. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Note: I don't agree with half the stuff I said in this review and I think my writing style is quite immature and undeveloped, but the community got a kick out of it, so I'll leave it here.\r\nKill la Kill has been praised as hilarious satire of action anime, but it ultimately fails to communicate to the watcher that it is satire by attempting to include profound thought amidst a spectacular display of skin and stupidity.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhen I saw Ryouku Matoi arriving at Honnouji Academy with half of a scissor to discover who killed her father, I'll admit that I was excited by the premiseof this show.  However, the plot for the first third of the show was repetitive and dull, and felt like 8 episodes of filler.  Then, Ryouku finally made her way to battle the woman she had been seeking, lost, and the show proceeded into an arc revolving around the concept that high schools have more authority in Japan.  While the dialogue is witty, the events are poorly written and crappily explained, and most of the time, one isn't even sure why the characters fight.  \\n\r\nNow, the show's elaborate screaming fight scenes would be okay if it was satire, as most deem it to be, but Kill La Kill leads you to believe that it's taking itself seriously.  There are dull conversations about how clothing somehow became sentient (huh?) and that it corrupts the human race (the explanation for how it corrupts humans is so shitty and half-assed i didn't bother trying to understand it.)\\n\r\nUltimately, I would accept the story as satire if it didn't try to be ridiculous, non-sensical, and philosophical/intelligent all at once.\\n\\n\r\nArt:5/10\\n\r\nWhile the fighting animation of the show is fluid and exciting, the environments are undeveloped and rely upon a dull color palette.  On top of that, the characters look like they are still sketches, filled with haphazard lines and only a few bright colors.  It's hard to tell the difference between Ira Gamagori and the desert with two buildings(half of the show's setting) behind him.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nKill la Kill features catchy openings, closings, and a  stellar fight theme in \"Before my Body is Dry,\" but \"Before my Body is Dry\" is the only song that the show ever plays.  The lack of variety is pretty sad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI'm not sure whether to give Characters a \"2\" or a \"10.\" Honestly, they're ridiculous and poorly developed (they remain pretty stagnant throughout all 24 episodes, except for Ryouku.)  This lack of development is fine if this is satire of action anime, but KLK still attempts to make a point about malicious clothing and human shame, so the one quality that could have made ridiculous characters and lack of development for everyone but Ryouku is perfectly fine is made null by the show's ardent desire for us to take it seriously by adding in more bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nMost jokes are pretty funny, and Mako Mankashouka is utterly hilarious, while Guts is pretty cool, too.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict: 5/10\\n\r\nAs long as you don't go into Kill la Kill expecting it to have legitimate, intellectual weight and commentary, you'll find a show that is pretty funny, and Ryouku's pretty hot.  It's a shame Kill la Kill couldn't decide if it wanted to be satire or serious.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nForgive me God of all Weaboos for I have sinned. I didn't enjoy Kill La Kill. Actually, it's worse than that. I fucking HATED Kill La Kill! It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, it wasn't a \"brilliant satire\". The animation was decent as befits a modern series with a huge budget, but nothing else was worthy of praise, let alone the amount of sheer adoration this series gets. Many people may disagree with this assessment, but I will explain.\r\nFirstly, I would like to clear something up that has been bothering me. My fellow Americans frequently use the word \"satire\" incorrectly, to the point that Iam convinced most people don't actually understand what it means anymore. There are several forms of classic satire, but the most common is probably still the Juvenalian satire created by the Roman writer Juvenal. The point of this style of satire is to write in a voice that the author actually opposes and comically highlight everything wrong with the position that the voice is supposedly arguing in favor of. A well known contemporary example would be Stephen Colbert's faux conservative character from the Colbert Report. In the next paragraph, I will show an example of what an actually \"brilliant satire\" looks like.\\n\\n\r\nIf Kill La Kill isn't what I consider a great satire then what the hell is? What does one look like? A good example of a truly brilliant and hilarious satire would be the novel Dead Souls. The novel was written to viciously mock the callous cruelty, uncaring nature, and disgusting greed of the upper class. Our \"hero\" is an immoral asshole who wishes to get rich using a profoundly ridiculous and darkly hilarious plan. The novel was written when slavery was still legal, and during that time period the law plainly stated that slaves counted only as property and not as people. Our hero figures out that therefore slaves could legally be purchased and sold after death because legally property doesn't suddenly cease being property. The concept of a sales catalog and people buying products without ever seeing them was brand new at the time and gives our hero a wonderful idea. He could legally buy hundreds of dead slaves for pennies and sell them (sight unseen) for about 10 dollars each to wealthy land owners who would jump at the deal of buying lots of slaves at a discount price. Our hero insinuates that his \"discount slaves\" are women, children, and elderly and that is why they are so cheap. He allows his buyers to fill in the details without ever explicitly saying an untruth and therefore avoiding being sued for false advertisement. His buyers believe that they have ripped off our hero, only to get hundreds of corpses dumped on their lawns. Every character including our \"hero\" is portrayed in an extremely negative manner and thus readers are encouraged to laugh our asses off at the slavers getting royally ripped off. The fact that the entire plan would have been completely legal at the time the novel was written only made it funnier. The author is pointing out to his  readers that they lived in a society where something that ghastly and morally outrageous was legal and encouraging them to fight against slavery without ever having to explicitly say so. A true satire makes a bold stance against a position that is still popular with a large portion of society and highlights everything wrong with that position. Satires address large societal issues and try to use comedy to create real social change. A satire is NOT just a work that revels in its own stupidity in order to vaguely mock other stupid works that are universally considered to be stupid.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so if Kill la Kill isn't technically satire then what is it? A work that tries to be really stupid and absurd in order to make fun of a genre is typically called a \"spoof\". Although less intellectually lofty than the satire, spoofs can still be great! Good examples would be the works of Mel Brooks like Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, which are quite rightly considered 2 of the greatest movies the United States has ever produced. Sadly, Hollywood never quite understood what made Mel Brook's movies so special and started shitting out truly awful spoofs: Mafia, Ricky 1 (a spoof of rocky), Scary Movie 1-5, Date Movie, Vampires Suck, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, etc. Enter Gainax, everyone's favorite insanely overrated anime studio to copy the Americans and produce their own low quality spoofs to cash in on this trend. We get \"great\" works like Kill La Kill and Panty and Stocking as a result! Hooray! Where does Kill La Kill rank on the hierarchy of spoofs? Slightly above the movies of Seltzer and Friedberg, but not quite as good as The Lucas Bros Moving Company.\\n\\n\r\nWe all know Shonen anime has REALLY stupid cliches, objectifies women, and has head bashingly retarded plot holes. Making a show that takes all that EVERYONE already agrees sucks about anime and reveling in its own shittyness isn't very clever and isn't actually a great goal. Simply being self aware of your own stupidity doesn't make a show or movie good. Was Wild Wild West aware that having a giant spider robot and REALLY silly dialogue and action was stupid? YES! They were very aware that they were making a stupid movie that took all the cliches of summer blockbusters and turned them up to 11. Does that  make Wild Wild West a clever cinematic masterpiece? NO! No it doesn't! In the same way, Kill La Kill's self awareness doesn't save it from being a piece of shit anime!",

            "content": "It\u2019s not often I come across shows that I would consider an \u201cinstant classic,\u201d a term that is often thrown out by a lot of movie critics. There have been a lot of anime classics in recent memory that has proved to be worthy of the spotlight and have garnered intense admiration from both casual and hardcore fans. However, these past couple years have shown that the ones that do get a great deal of hype and attention during its inception are looked at with mostly skepticism as to whether they deserved all of it, to begin with. Then in the year 2013, out comesa show named Kill La Kill. A show that not only justified its hype but managed to break the mold for current trends that will make it unforgettable for years on end.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know the history of how this project was done, it\u2019s quite an accomplishment, to say the least, for a little studio like Trigger. Being headed by the director, Hiroyuki Imaishi, a man who previously worked for Gainax and directed the other anime classics like Gurren Lagaan and Panty & Stocking, but later left in 2011 to form Trigger with co-director Masahiko Ohtsuka. Considering how Gainax has been doing as of late, this would probably be the smartest move any director would\u2019ve ever made. The studio had made a few production credits before Kill La Kill and had gained some exposure after making the short film Little Witch Academia. Finally, they made their first official anime series in Kill La Kill. Out of all of the debuts for anime studios, you couldn\u2019t have asked for a stellar first impression quite like this show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very opening of the first episode of Kill La Kill, we are now being shoved into a world that is chaotic and filled with disorder within the social classes of people. Not just from the actual story itself, but from the art style and animation that comes with them. Every single character is drawn with fluid clarity while at the same time very disorganized with a cartoonish aesthetic to it. These sorts of thematic set-pieces shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone who has seen Gurren Lagaan; at the same time, it can be argued that Kill La Kill is ten times wackier than Gurren Lagaan in terms of tone and art style. It\u2019s these two aspects about Hiroyuki that make him one of the top anime directors living today, in how he has this massive vision for spectacle. More often than not, he does not disappoint in any of the shows he\u2019s been at the helm of.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe the plot in the simplest terms, it\u2019s quite absurd, silly, anarchistic, and ridiculous in many areas. Many might see this as a negative at face value with the advent of gratuitous fanservice being thrown out left and right, the uneven pacing, and the alienating nature of how the story is told with hardly any context. Despite all of these aspects that might sound negative at first, upon closer speculation of the show as it goes along, all of them feel really proper to Kill La Kill\u2019s overall vision of how it portrays its story, characters, and art. All of them have the specific purpose of being the way they are, and they succeed in achieving the amount of charm and personality it incorporates with them that make them entertaining to watch and laugh at. Now, if it were animated in a traditional way like most anime shows, it wouldn\u2019t have necessarily been bad, but it just wouldn\u2019t accomplish nearly enough with the lack of coherency with the tone and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn critiquing the actual plot itself, it\u2019s not necessarily the most original that anime has come to expect. Your average revenge action shows that follows a linear narrative of a girl, named Ryuuko Matoi, with her sidekick, Mako Mankanshou, who she encounters early on in her revenge journey to kill the main villain of the show, Satsuki Kiryuuin. That shouldn\u2019t suggest that Kill La Kill needed to have a complicated story, to begin with. Everything else that makes the show work is its self-awareness of how nonsensical the action scenes are and the ridiculous amount of fanservice that would put most ecchi series to shame. As I\u2019ve described the show\u2019s plot as anarchistic before, I meant that in the sense of how the writers feel that they shot down the cliches that have plagued the vast majority of anime today and make them of their own accord that makes them unique to Kill La Kill. They are the same cliches, but they make it fresh by how they portray it in an old-school layout with the Japanese texts that pop up, which are reminiscent of anime from the \u201990s. As with Gurren Lagaan, Kill La Kill\u2019s grand finale proves to be worth the joyous ride thanks to some well-developed cliffhangers that add some exciting plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with plot, the characters that sprout up in Kill La Kill are no less than unforgettable from their personalities to their future growth as real characters. Individually, I\u2019d like to start with the main hero, Ryuuko Matoi. Her intentions are simple in layman\u2019s terms. However, her enthusiastic rage and determination written to her archetype are stellar. It\u2019s these two facets that make for an ingenious hero in an action shounen show with the enormous size and scope that Kill La Kill has. They make the hero engaging and attention-grabbing so we can empathize with her struggle to overcome any obstacle that gets in her way of achieving her goal, whatever the case may be. As the plot goes further, her growth is handled with great clarity and pacing. Her strength and courage become more vivid to see while she improves her well-being as a person after learning new information about who killed her father and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character that deserves her spotlight is the lovable Mako. Probably the most eccentric out of all of the characters in Kill La Kill, although her entire family could be construed to that as well. The same way how Ryuuko is a fantastic character due to her charisma and attention-grabbing, Mako is like that but in a different angle. She\u2019s the comic relief for the show, and thanks to the tremendous snappy animation, her comedic antics that involve jumping on people affectionately to show her love for her friends and her attempts at trying to encourage Ryuuko to stay strong are all incredibly sincere and entertaining. Most of the charm that is apparent in the show come from Mako, and it\u2019s a great blessing that she\u2019s given a considerable amount of screen-time, which really gives her a lot of material to show forth.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish off the rest of the cast, our main villain Satsuki is about as charismatic and devoted to her goal as our main heroine, which is saying a lot. She has an extremely intimidating presence to her and likewise is always an excellent sign for a villain. Due to spoilers, I won\u2019t go further on how the other villains play out, but needless to say, they all fill out their roles just as well as Satsuki does. The male characters in the show all have the same type of charisma that made Mako great, with a similar comedic schtick that only differs slightly due to their genders. Another sidekick to Ryuuko is her own talking outfit Senketsu, whose amusing quips are pretty genuine and funny.\\n\\n\r\nFanservice has been the black sheep of anime for many people who generally can\u2019t get into it. Some may say that there\u2019s no such thing as an intelligent way of showcasing fanservice, but that\u2019s far from the truth. Sure, many examples do fail in doing so, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that fanservice can\u2019t be done positively; in which Kill La Kill may be the best example that we have. Allow me to explain. You have girls wearing very provocative clothing in this show that barely covers every part of their body that might seem like they are just portrayed as objects or characters just for the sake of sexual promiscuity. Bad fanservice like this is when girls are only represented as that and nothing else, but good fanservice is when the girls themselves control their sexuality and body that overshadows the potential scenario of becoming just an object of affection. When Ryuuko puts on the suggestive outfit, she still becomes a strong woman despite being portrayed in this lewd fashion and can become one with the gear, along with Satsuki. When you want fanservice to become intelligent, you need to realize the real strength of how girls can indeed become independent beings and still become strong characters, while pleasing the audiences\u2019 eyes as a bonus. If you don\u2019t even attempt in doing so, then you\u2019ve failed to gain any merit to the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nFor a while, there hasn\u2019t been much action anime that made me feel really excited to watch the actual action, due to how the animation in most of them doesn\u2019t really translate well with great flair and precision. Backed up with the animation of Kill La Kill, I found myself really engaged with the action in the show by how the art style of the characters and how they move really fluidly in the retro-looking animation. The way to do action right is to keep flowing with minimal interference while we listen to the characters thinking to themselves for almost a minute on how they\u2019ll get out of a particular situation. Not a dull moment passes by with the level of creativity that is given to Kill La Kill\u2019s animation, and the action sequences are just one of the few big reasons as to why this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nWith music being the main driving force of how action can be exciting. the main genre Kill La Kill focuses on is your typical guitar-driven orchestration that is influenced by many J-Rock acts as of late. The other thing that also gives the show its added camaraderie is the voice casting. Ryuuko being played by Ami Koshimizu is probably the most appropriate voice actress anybody could\u2019ve picked. I would even argue that this is Ami\u2019s best role that she has ever had in her career since Kallen from Code Geass. Another fantastic performance is by the up and coming star Aya Suzaki playing Mako. Her active voice fits perfectly with Mako\u2019s presence in the show, and the amount of enthusiasm she expresses through her lines that go on for quite a while in each episode is quite astounding.\\n\\n\r\nThe accomplishment of Kill La Kill\u2019s influence is something that will live on for as long as anime will continue to prosper. It\u2019s a show that does not care what its detractors say about it because it just doesn\u2019t have any rules or order to be found in its bones. Imaginative ideas are very hard to come by with any medium as of now, but that is to be accepted with how the economic climate is in Japan. Kill La Kill and how it was created by a young studio goes to show that these possibilities still exist and will continue to exist for however long this medium will live. Trigger studio has a lot to prove for whatever projects they\u2019re planning to do in the future, but with this as their first main series, that possibility is but only at arms reach.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A",

            "content": "So if you've read my Attack on Titan review, you know I'm not a fan of the hype but after hearing how similar Kill La Kill was to Gurren Lagann or something like Dead Leaves, I couldn't say no. Its been a while and I felt like my elitist brain could afford to be taken down a notch for a good 24 episodes; and it was heaven. It was like rewatching that show with swords and clothes instead of mechs and flashy lights. Honestly if you were thinking about rewatching Gurren Lagann anytime soon, I'd watch this because you're watching essentially the same show withsome differences, and you'll get the ADD tooth satisfied. But that also entails the fact that Kill La Kill suffers from downfalls that TTGL did, but sometimes to a worse degree.\\n\\n\r\nAs you probably have seen from everyone slapping their lips together on the internet Kill La Kill is all about style over substance and teases you with some plot every now and again. But for the meat and potatoes of the positive of the show; it's all about the action and the wonderfully flashy animation, and you really can't say much more about it. The other big perk of the show is the humor. It goes from being obnoxious and slapstick (in the vein of Looney Toons, seriously)to incredibly clever self aware jokes about what they're doing, what someone didn't need to repeat, or how bizarre Nudisto Beachu is is. And the show is so packed with attitude that you'll hear most of the characters shoot off a clever bout of screamed sarcasm most of the time. Dialogue and action are really the show's strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters themselves, while static and formulaic, are pretty great and are reminders of why I like shows like this so much. Ryuko is awesome to watch (and not because action requires her to be half naked), and the feeling I got from watching her struggle was similar to sitting down and listening to a favorite metal album at full volume after someone said something pants-on-head stupid at work. Lady Satsuki makes for a phenomenal villain (until the villain switch up I won't spoil that is) and plays well on the Yin to Ryuko's Yang of being a ruthless leader. The rest of the characters however might bring a gag (Mako) or a cool series of action sequences (the Elite Four) to the stage, but other than that they make the show work for the sake of being crazy and fun, but aren't in or are themselves very interesting. The villains and the powers of the characters is where the show started to slump a bit, as Kill La Kill is one of the shows that suffers from Egg of the King Syndrome (see my Black Butler review  and Berserk review when it comes out). When you find out certain characters just don't die, the weight of feeling the tension of their struggle disappears. And even after such death defying experiences I was sad to find that few characters really learned anything, especially after switching alliances from one side to the other. They just kinda change sides and now they're friends. Those who have watched at least halfway through the show know what I'm talking about. The other issue with them is it's difficult to see their relevance to the world they occupy. If they're in school, why are they going? It seems unlikely that so many of the students would go there and teachers teach there to become part of a larger plan. So characters are good but not great, and I dare you to look me in the eye and tell me Mikisugi isn't Kamina.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside of Kill La Kill is obviously where I have to get analytic otherwise writing reviews wouldn't be fun. It does have a plot, it's just that it's as not serious and nonsensical as TTGL's was and unfortunately was desperate to be taken seriously. The issue with Kill La Kill's plot is that not only is it the painfully predictable save the world from aliens that look weird story we've all seen a thousand times regardless on if you like anime or not. Another issue is that the plot is a royal little tease. It begins by referencing, and I kid you not, George Orwell's 1984, and at first I thought it would become a giant metaphor for facism with flashy action like what Fooly Cooly had created with puberty. However because the story will do 180 degree spin-kicks of introducing new plot elements and characters throughout paired with the fact that the story was predictable and corny had gotten my hopes down for a giant, deeper metaphor. It tries to go deep by making references and talking about mega-corporations using clothing to take over the world, but the end result of everything ending in a big sword-and-boob flinging match doused that flame pretty quick. As for the 180 degree turns...said sharp turns in the story such as introducing new villains or unveiling true intentions aren't really plot twists as much as they are frustrating. I spent time watching characters fight and win just to get a completely different story out of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo you liked TTGL you'll like Kill La Kill. Kill La Kill I thought had better music too that only added to the attitude and the bigness of the show, and while the trade off of having better music and action, it still doesn't beat Gurren Lagann in quality, world-building, story and character building. It's fun to watch but doesn't live up to the hype.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes a show doesn't need to have the most coherent plot or a cast of sensible and realistic characters to succeed in entertaining its audience. These shows appeal to our emotions and excel at utilizing momentum and suspense to keep us watching and demanding more. While Kill La Kill doesn't bring us anything revolutionary or extraordinary in terms of plot development or character design, the manner in which Trigger presents and delivers the show in a way where you can't help but give it your full attention as you watch an episode. Through a mix of over-the-top fan service, exaggerated confrontations and battle scenes, ridiculousand nonsensical humor, all under an equally insane and, for lack of a better word, creative premise and plot, Kill La Kill brings us a show that, at the very least, will keep you entertained and amused throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Matoi Ryuuko, our fresh, fierce-looking transfer student at Honnouji Academy, where Kiryuuin Satsuki's word is law and your star rank represents your position in society. A girl on a mission to find her father's murderer, with only half of a giant red scissor blade as her clue, Ryuuko stops at nothing to seek the truth, even if it means toppling the very foundation of the Academy itself. She's not alone, however; the ever-energetic and friendly Mankanshoku Mako and her family serve as Ryuuko's beacon of support and source of the occasional pile of delicious croquettes. By fighting her way to the top of the Honnouji hierarchy with her trusted Kamui Senketsu, yet another memento of her late father, she may get the answers to her questions, and maybe, just maybe, something much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko's character development throughout the show was nothing stellar, yet at the same time I found myself becoming angry at the reckless situations she throws herself into, smiling silly at her goofy relationship with Mako, and cheering madly for her as she defeats numerous powerful adversaries. While the whole \"there's this girl who has enormous potential but is initially weak, yet later through the support of her friends and the ones that believe in her makes her a force to be reckoned with\" concept is fairly cheesy, cliche, and overused, Kill La Kill makes the best of a bad situation and uses it to their advantage. Whether it's Ryuuko challenging Satsuki in a battle in which she clearly would be outclassed yet comes out even due to the support of Mako or the strength of her resolve, or it's Ryuuko getting full of herself with her newfound strength, getting overconfident, then falling to an enemy she underestimates; while scenarios like these are extremely cliche, the unique flair and style Kill La Kill adds to these situations makes it captivating and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nA heavily debated topic that Kill La Kill often sparks is over the concept of fan service. While your standard anime fan service will offer things such as, but not limited to, beach scenes with an irregular average guy to incredibly cute or beautiful girl ratio, a skirt flipped by the wind much to the chagrin of the embarrassed yet pretty young school girl etc etc, Kill La Kill's so called \"fan service\" is delivered in the form of heavily revealing battle outfits and consistent nudity with minimal censorship through light or objects. However, unlike most fan service scenes where the actual concept in question is brought to the viewers attention, Kill La Kill does a good job avoiding that. While there are parts where people ogle at Ryuuko's transformed state in Senketsu, or the Elite Four squabbling amongst themselves and telling each other to go put on some clothing, the show very well could have removed it completely and for the most part the foundation of the show would not have changed. For those who like it, all the more power to you. For those who despise it, looking past it or ignoring it will not diminish the impact the show has.\\n\\n\r\nFitting for a show like Kill La Kill, the art and sound complement the show tremendously. The artwork seems like it was drawn with vigor and the use of sharp lines and sketch marks makes battle scenes come to life. The soundtrack, in typical action anime fashion, does a very good job in matching the scene the episode is depicting. From tension-filled and ominous scenes accompanied by dark and sinister music to action-packed and flashy battle scenes with sharp and vivid background sounds, Kill La Kill does an excellent job piecing together a well coordinated story and soundboard. \\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill excels in drawing its audience in with larger than life battles, ridiculous yet clever nicknames for various special moves, secret operations, and over-the-top clothing, and fairly unpredictable plot twists and turns that evoke a wide range of emotions ranging from disappointment to shock and awe. It's a show that will be hit or miss for a majority of viewers, but one thing is for sure; it's difficult to be bored or not entertained while watching Kill La Kill.\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nWhen deciding whether an anime is good or not I always critique it based on a certain criteria, with well written story & characters being absolutely essential to qualify. But every now and then there's an anime title that comes along where conventional methods of critiquing become obsolete. These shows often focus on certain aspects that make them unique in their own right and doesn't follow conventional standards. May it be a mindless blockbuster style 'shoot em up' like Black Lagoon, an intense psychological roller coaster like Kaiji or a 'rule of cool' cultural mash-up like Samurai Champloo. These shows all havecertain aspects that make them stand out from the crowd and have garnered a following from fans because of it. \\n\r\nThen there are shows that take it to another extreme.. Shows that are powered by NONSENSICAL, STUPID, OVER THE TOP, FUCKIN INSANITY like FLCL, Gurren Lagann and Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt........but somehow, despite being illogical screwball nonsense, they actually manage to work. Now enter the next anime to take that mantle, Kill La Kill. An anime so ludicrous, so left field, so stupid that you can't help but have a smile plastered on your face from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is a story to be found in KLK, it's safe to say many won't be watching it for a well written narrative. In fact the story is rather ridiculous, going from a simple revenge tale to global domination conspiracy where clothes are extraterrestrial lifeforms who developed human evolution. YES you heard me right, Charles Darwin theory of natural selection was a lie, it was clothes all along.\\n\r\nThe first half follows our protagonist Ryuuko Matoi as she climb the school hierarchy one step at a time defeating each opponent in order to find out the truth about her father's killer. This is done in a beat em up style, almost similar to a arcade fighting game. This lead to alot of high octane encounter that will capture the attentiveness of even the most jaded audience. \\n\r\nThe 2nd half is where they up the ante however with a conflict that spans beyond the initial one set to something on a global scale. Complete with a global domination plot and a megalomaniac. It's absurd but in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where this anime truly shines. Kill La Kill is a powerhouse of animated freedom. As superficial as judging something on how it looks is, there's no other way to express what this series stands for. It doesn't constrict itself to a set standard but rather switch to many different styles of animation. You can go from a mixture of watercolor brush stroked artsyle mixed with traditional techniques to a bunch of cardboard cutouts dancing across the screen without a moments notice. As left field as this sounds, it's this very off the wall cheap yet brilliant animation style that makes everything from the giant \"in your face\" letters to the vibrant colored madness to work. This is what elevates KLK  from being more than just being another action romp. The visual extravaganza will keep you hooked! Either that or give you a seizure. \\n\r\nNow where the show becomes repulsive  at times is the fanservice but if you've come into a ecchi anime and expect people dressed like nuns then slap yourself right now for being an idiot. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as lively as the anime it corresponds. With bombastic pop  pieces to orchestric rock and everything in-between, this wide range of scores does a good job of keeping up with the show's energetic pace. Both the sub and dub performances were also handled with care. Standouts being Carrie Keranen english voice acting for Satsuki Kiryuuin, in which she captured the iron clad personality flawlessly. Also both sub and dub performances for Mako Mankanshoku, which captured her bubbly off the wall attitude. Both OP and ED weren't anything worth listening to on a stand alone listen, since the pop rock songs can be heard in almost every other anime series but they still compliment the show to the very least. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWith an anime as lively as this one a cast of equal caliber of insanity is needed to match it. Take every character archetype and amplify it to ungodly proportions and you'll have your characters in a nutshell.\\n\r\nThe Elite Four are all over exaggerated stereotypes, Ragyou is a sadistic bitch and the rest follow suite in being over the top.\\n\r\nRyuuko Matoi is a rather refreshing female lead in a medium that treats its female characters as either a \"damsel in distress\" or just another harem girl to conquer. She is very head strong and loyal to her friends.\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there, KLK have yet another strong willed female in Satsuki Kiryuuin. These two play off as the whole \"two sides of the same coin\" gig but it never impedes upon the show's enjoyment. And last but not least, Mako Mankanshoku who provides comedic relief. You'd either love her goofy antics or find her annoying but there's no denying her role in the series, representing what KLK is all about. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before conventional critiquing doesn't really work for anime like this. Kill La Kill is something you have to personally experience to understand, its not something you can get a grasp of from word of mouth. That being said I got what I expected out of it and that was a fun ride and also a reminder of what makes anime, well.. \"anime\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe fanbase of this show have been proclaiming that \"this saved anime\" . while I don't believe that to be true, I can to the very least say that it's certainly a welcome addiction to the mix. Breathing new life into a medium that has grown stale. If you're tired of the dime a dozen school rom-coms, moe blobs and cardboard cutout MCs then this will certainly do the trick.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars!\u201d \u2013 Satsuki Kiryuin\r\nKill La Kill - My 40th review, and a very special one for me. \r\nDoes it need an introduction? As one of the most hyped, popular, and polarizing anime of 2013 (2013 was a big year for anime) it\u2019s likely that most everyone knows it by reputation, if not having seen it outright. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 10\r\nKill La Kill is unique. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s slightly dissimilar from what immediately marks the art style of anime as a whole, no- it\u2019s one of a kind. It\u2019s obvious that Trigger was under a budgetconstraint, being that this was their first major animation project as a new studio, AND an independent, original product. Hiroyuki Imaishi\u2019s signature style is the definitive way of describing KLK\u2019s visual aspects. His flair for scope and scale come together with great character designs and slightly rough, but mercurially animation. The new studio Trigger has set the standard for speed, quick cuts, and stretching the boundaries of what can be done with animation. The generally over the top style of Imaishi is incredible to behold here. No other anime has been able to look like and do what Kill La Kill has with a similar budget and time- it\u2019s a work of art purely out of talent. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nEdge: Japanese audio\\n\r\nI\u2019m typically not a proponent of sub or dub with any consistency. However, I will consistently defend that this show is immensely enjoyable to hear in EITHER language. My first and second viewings were in the original Japanese, which I immediately fell in love with. The incredibly dynamic performances are given by not only the main cast, but by even EVERYONE in the supporting cast!\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese cast is a group of superstars. An all veteran, amazing group of talent with a credit list as long as the Empire State building, this group has done it all. Ami Koshimizu and Ryouka Yuzuki head up the cast as Ryuko and Satsuki respectively. Aya Suzuki as the cocaine addicted hype woman Mako Mankanshoku couldn\u2019t have been a better fit. Toshihiko Seki, longtime VA, as Senketsu brought feeling and dynamics to an animate piece of clothing. Who can say that they made a Sailor Uniform feel more human than the casts of entire other shows put together? Finally, one of my favorites, Yukari Tamura, does some of her best work as the dual personalities of Nui Harime. The amount of work, feeling, and emotion put into these performances is absolutely immense. They sold the comedy, they played it straight to great effect, and they were able to wring out a heretofore inconceivable amount of hype and awesomeness in the vein of Gurren Lagann. The gold standard of how effective voice acting can be.\\n\\n\r\nWhere were you the first time you heard \u201cAmbiguous\u201d? One of the most immediately recognizable and memorable parts of Kill La Kill is the music. When \u201cBefore My Body Is Dry\u201d played the first time, it was destined to be a hit. Endless AMVs, mashups, English versions, covers, and basically any other form of remix have been done to it, and every song in the series- and for good reason: they\u2019re fantastic. Fantastic use of insert songs, namely different versions of Mika Kobayashi\u2019s \"Before My Body Is Dry\", high strung orchestral compositions, hard rock riffs, Heavenly choruses, and two of the most endlessly catchy openings in all of anime, one from Eir Aoi, \"Sirius\", and one from GARNiDELiA, the aforementioned \"Ambiguous\". I bought the soundtrack, and it\u2019s absolutely worth it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is again unique in that it can be viewed multiple times and have extremely varied ideas, themes, and metaphor/allegory pulled from it, depending on how it was seen. One can watch it purely at face value, and thoroughly enjoy the absolute insanity going on screen at any given time. It\u2019s got giant robots, it\u2019s got explosions, satire, parody, and it\u2019s got two hopped up, superpowered, scantily clad teenage girls going at it with swords ripping shit up! If that\u2019s all this show was, maybe the criticisms of it being mere male power fantasy and exploitative, titillating ecchi garbage would be valid. However, unlike Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers, there actually is more than meets the eye here.\\n\r\nDeep within the heart of the Life Fiber that makes up Kill La Kill is an intensely smart, metaphor and allegory heavy narrative that hearkens back into several important events in the history of Feudal Japan. There\u2019s also a ton of name symbolism, references and allegory for mythology, and gods of many religions, World War 2, commentary on the oppressive Japanese school and work culture, and an immediately obvious metaphor for the struggles of puberty and the ubiquitous coming of age tale. Ogres are like onions. They have \u2018layers.\u2019 Kill La Kill is like an onion. It has \u2018layers.\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nTo start things off; the Honnouji Incident. In 1582, Oda Nobunaga had nearly subjugated and consolidated all of Japan, save the Kansai region, which consists of Kobe, Kyoto, and Osaka. He was overthrown in Kyoto by his general Akechi Mitsuhide and forced to commit suicide. Ragyo\u2019s plot to consolidate not only Japan, but also the world with the Life Fiber\u2019s power, and subsequent overthrowing are immediate similarities. \\n\r\nNot necessarily by one event, but the Fashion/Fascism theme is present throughout the story in the form of Honnouji Academy, and then overshadowed by Revocs and Ragyo herself. In both somewhat of a reference to Japan in WW2, and likening the Japanese educational system to that of a fascist dictatorship, Kill La Kill takes on a social commentary facet that is rather intriguing. With the overall theme of rebellion, finding oneself and one\u2019s place in society, these subjects mesh together quite well. \\n\\n\r\nTo give a bit of perspective; postwar Japan was not a pretty place. To help raise themselves out of the prior political system and stigma of the Emperor, the system was completely revamped into a more democratic one. Along with that came educational reform, which contributed greatly to their rapid economic recovery. Education became compulsory, for both boys and girls, and literacy rates skyrocketed to record highs. With educational increases so great, so too came with them the pressure to perform and correct what were perceived failures of the past. Coupled with the high pressure work culture, the school and educational environment followed suit- upholding and reinforcing the culturally revered values of hard work, loyalty, and determination to reap a high benefit in both status and monetarily- the idea of success. The school culture is much the same: mind your business, do what you\u2019re supposed to do, don\u2019t stick out, and be a good student. \\n\\n\r\nAs Kill La Kill relates to this: the idea that individuality, the sticking out, being your own person in the midst of the sea of little cogs that make the machine work is not only an acceptable thing, but necessary for growth. The uniformity and repeated character design of the no-star students is evident of this- and they appear eerily as a well-trained army at several points. They\u2019re small, insignificant, and easily replaceable, like little cogs. Ryuko is very obviously a Scissor blade shaped wrench being slung into the midst of this. Satsuki and the Elite Four are the \u201cfascist\u201d ruling party of the school, keeping everyone in line, keeping the machine that is the \u201cconquering\u201d educational system churning out perfect little cookie cutter shaped students in the mold of \u201cperfection\u201d. \u201cFear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! Contradiction is truth! Those are the facts of this world! And you will all surrender to them, you pigs in human clothing!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nFinishing tying up the puberty and finding oneself themes- Ryuko\u2019s individuality and bucking of the trend are struggles that every teen faces: the pressure to fit in, to be a perfect, molded student, and the desire to be something more- a person of your own choosing. As the story progresses, so too does this theme work its way not only into the other students, but the plot itself, on a more macro scale.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss Kill La Kill as being \u201cyet another shonen \u2018more power\u2019 show\u201d, or nonsensical childish entertainment- but again, this is the genius of Kill La Kill. It CAN be those things, if you want it to be. Kill La Kill is easy to watch as a shallow action series, no problem. The \u201cfanservice\u201d and hypersexualization are typically the first points detractors will bring up. Let it suffice to say that if that\u2019s the only negative about this show, then you missed the joke. Many anime in recent days have taken to pandering to the least common denominator entertainment viewers. Most people call this ecchi and fanservice. Kill La Kill lampshades this by taking it to the absolute extreme, calling attention to it, and not only moving on from it, but actually turning it into a plot point! Part of the whole idea expressed in the individualism is that of the clothing that we wear. The threads that bind- if you will. Kill La Kill brings a brilliant undertone of satire to the table in moments like these, lampooning things from the nudity and sexualization that are so prevalent now to other things, including entire genres and categorizations of anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut as I\u2019ve laid out above, and other themes I\u2019ve not discussed, it\u2019s what\u2019s under the surface that makes this a true diamond in the collective crust of anime as a whole. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nRyuko Matoi is the quintessential school delinquent. Kicked out of several high schools prior to her arrival at Honnouji Academy due to violent altercations and a penchant for trouble, Ryuko is searching for her father\u2019s murderer. Wielding her half of a giant pair of magical scissors and clad in every stereotype of ecchi, shonen, superpower, and male fantasy, she\u2019s a walking subversion of magical girl, and essentially every trope of the aforementioned genres. Ryuko personifies willpower, determination, and the ability to win against all odds- similarly to her shonen counterparts- but with a twist. She\u2019s plainly aware of what she\u2019s doing. \\n\r\nThe typical shonen plot revolves around some young kid who gains a superpower and uses it to fight against whatever indignities they find themselves confronted with, with a smattering of chibi humor, goofy situations, and thinly veiled attempts at heavy handed morality lessons about the nature of responsibility or whatever. \\n\r\nRyuko throws all this out the window. New powers? Cool, let\u2019s do it. Aren\u2019t you at all bothered by this immense amount of death and destruction you\u2019ve wrought against the populace in your quest to uncover the truth about your father? Nope, not really. \\n\\n\r\nRyuko represents the unsureness and unknown world of breaking out of the teen shell, but while still being a child. This is symbolized in her relationship with Senketsu and the Mankanshoku Family. She begins as anyone- with an idea of a goal, but no real means of achieving it, until she comes into a means that allow her to transform into her full potential: the Kamui. In order for her to be able to fight for what she wants, she has to grow, both as a person, and in strength. As explained in the show, the reason Senketsu is unable to fully support her and uses her blood to such a degree,  is that she hasn\u2019t opened up to him, or embraced the fear and shame of having all ya stuff out there on display for the sake of being empowered. It\u2019s about fear of the unknown, stepping outside your boundaries, and coming face to face with what you have to deal with to get along in this world. As seen in episode 12, Ryuko isn\u2019t some infallible shonen character; consumed by her rage- a symbol for the teen angst and hormone imbalances that cause such instability- she loses control- and sight of what it is that was her ultimate goal: was it vengeance against the murderer of her father, or her fight against injustice for herself?\\n\r\nMany use this point of the Kamui turning Ryuko and Satsuki into scintillating displays of fanservice to dismiss any possibility of character growth, but this is simply not the case. In fact, the Kamui transformations are yet another subversion of magical girl and ecchi/fanservice tropes that are so common now. Ryuko is very self-aware, and to a point, embarrassed about how the transformation renders her outfit into a stripperific costume- it\u2019s lampshaded, and moved on from. The nudity and oversexualization are never the point of the story as they would be in a lesser show- but are worked into this ever revolving, multifaceted work of art. \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki herself is an allegory straight out of history: being both the aforementioned conqueror Oda Nobunaga and the usurper Akechi Mitsuhide. The relationship between Ragyo and Satsuki, who has conquered all the schools in Japan except those three of the Kansai region, is very reminiscent of this historical event. Satsuki, alongside Ryuko, goes on a personal journey as well- one of the struggles of the expectations of your elders, parents, and of society upon the displaced, out of element teen. Satsuki\u2019s fight is not one of vengeance for a lost loved one, but one of finding herself, and her place in the world outside of the demands of her mother. \\n\r\nIn episode 25, Satsuki gets some of the best characterization I\u2019d seen in the show, a shame that it was so late coming. When she\u2019s defeated her enemies, quelled all the issues in front of her, and finished her fight- which is all that she\u2019s known -what else is there for her beyond that? When the intense struggle against your entire being is all the history you\u2019ve ever had, what happens when the conflict finally ends? What are you then, when your only definition has been fighting and struggling? The story of Satsuki putting down the sword is really touching, and gives her a more humane side, and full circle of character that was very enjoyable to see play out after the fierceness and strife that she was up until that point.\\n\\n\r\nThe Elite Four are representative of the four heavenly kings of Buddhist Mythology and the mystical apes: Do, See, Hear, and Speak No Evil. The Buddhist heavenly kings are: Tamon-ten, he who hears all; Zojo-ten, he who causes growth; Jikoku-ten, he who upholds the realm; and Komoku-ten, he who sees all.\\n\r\nGamagoori, as chairman of the disciplinary committee would obviously be Do No Evil, and Jikoku-ten, who \u2018upholds\u2019 the discipline. \\n\r\nSanageyama is blind, but sees all. \\n\r\nJakuzure is the princess of sound, which makes Hear No Evil and Zojo-ten make sense here, where she continually gets larger and more powerful Symphony Regalia. \t\\n\r\nInumuta represents Speak No Evil, and Tamon-ten, due to his intelligence network and powers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs a product: it\u2019s a complete entertainment package. It\u2019s riotously funny, it\u2019s off the wall, left field crazy. Like FLCL before it, this is sort of an amalgam of a myriad of things that are enjoyable and what make anime fun: over the top battles, drama, a touch of politics, mystery and intrigue, fun characters, and one statement I don\u2019t throw out much, but applies here: \u201cOnly Japan.\u201d That\u2019s really the best way to describe it; it\u2019s so wild and out there that it could have only come from one place.\\n\r\nFurthermore, the puns and wordplay jokes that are signature to well written Japanese humor coupled with Imaishi\u2019s penchant for lowdown, dirty jokes play out hilariously in this. Due to the fact that the title of the show itself, and a significant portion of the plot are also based wholly off of puns in the Japanese language, it makes it that much sweeter. To extrapolate: Kill La Kill is obviously English. Duh, you moron. \\n\r\nKiru ra Kiru would be the romaji- the kanji on which the pronunciation of Kiru comes from has the triple meaning (or readings) of \u201cto cut\u201d, \u201cto kill\u201d, or \u201cto wear\u201d- the central plot points. Fashion and Fascism are English loanwords, which are both alliterative, and again, play a major role here. Perhaps the most interesting, and that tie up the ends of the Oda Nobunaga/Japan unification (along with the end of this review) and the plot are the words \u201cconquest\u201d and \u201cuniform\u201d. Seifuku is the romaji, which comes from kanji that can be read as either conquest or uniform. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much left to be said about this series than what I\u2019ve already laid out. An in depth analysis of themes, symbols, and deeper meaning is what I felt was the only appropriate way to amalgamate the subject matter and do justice to this incredible series. This was the review I never thought I would be able to write. There were so many things I loved about Kill La Kill that it may be impossible to list them- but I\u2019ve done my due diligence to try and set into words the vast complex of topics that set this show apart from any other I\u2019ve seen, and potentially any other in existence. It\u2019s my favorite, after all. \\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr (Yeah, I see you, you review skipping pig in human clothing)\\n\\n\r\n+ Intricately woven plot replete with metaphor, allegory, and symbolism; alternately viewable as a shallow action series- up to you.\\n\r\n+ Dynamic, over the top, intense Voice Acting by great veterans and noobs alike\\n\r\n+ Absolutely hilarious\\n\r\n+ Great action scenes, set pieces, and a very unique art style.\\n\r\n+/- Perceived fanservice may be offputting, but it\u2019s part of the parody!\\n\r\n+/- Very Imaishi- fast, crude jokes, everything you expect from his productions\\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely. Kill La Kill is a complete, consummate package of entertainment. Inspirational, brilliant, funny, thought provoking, and endlessly entertaining: the experience that makes anime as a medium worth it for the sheer infinity of possibilities. \\n",

It is a really fun show for those that can stomach OTT stuff. On the other hand, it is a cringe-worthy ride for those that can\u2019t. The first episode starts off with our protagonist, Ryuko Matoi, challenging the Student Council president Kiryuin Satsuki holding a giant blade that is apparently one half of what makes a huge pair of scissors. That, my friend, in itself is enough togive you an idea as to how ridiculous this show is. If ridiculous isn\u2019t your cup of tea then you ought to stay away from this series. Oh, and then there\u2019s the fact that almost every single episode consists of scantily clad girls fighting it out with each other. If you can\u2019t stand some skin, please walk away from this series. Because you will see a lot of skin. Both female and male fanservice is present in this show in spades.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is brought to you by studio Trigger. The people who brought us Little Witch Academia and Inferno Cop. And these are the same guys who worked on TTGL. With a good number of people who put this on their watch list being aware of it being made by those that made TTGL, they\u2019re obviously bound to have a few expectations. The over-the-top atmosphere and the similar art styles the shows share don\u2019t help, either. But, ultimately, they\u2019re different shows. And thus should be judged differently. That\u2019s enough about TTGL, though. Let\u2019s get on to the categories I\u2019ll cover in this review -\\n\\n\r\nThis review will be divided into the following sections: \\n\\n\r\n1. Art & Animation\\n\r\n2. Soundtrack\\n\r\n3. Characters\\n\r\n4. Story\\n\\n\r\n----Art & Animation----\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s art style is a far cry from the typical art style most anime these days possess. It is much more cartoon-ish in nature in comparison. But that doesn\u2019t mean it is a negative point against the show at all. In fact, the show plays it to its strength by using the potential of a cartoon-ish art style to its fullest \u2013 the highly exaggerated scenes, as a result, prove to be far more effective than they\u2019d be under normal circumstances. As a result, the art style is definitely something that fits the show to a \u2018t\u2019 and compliments its OTT nature greatly. It is a definite 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe same, however, cannot be said for the animation. Kill la Kill was made under a tight budget and, as such, there have been plenty of instances in the show where the creators had to cut corners. They try to minimize animation during the non-action scenes and generally put all the budget into the action scenes. As a result, there\u2019s an immense amount of variation in the animation quality throughout the series. There are fights like the ones in episode 3 that look brilliant and are very fluid and well choreographed. And then there are scenes where you\u2019d feel like you\u2019re looking at a bunch of slides with a few moving parts. The show DOES, however, deserve a pat on the back to actually try and use its limited budget to its fullest \u2013 a lot of times they use limited frames in comedy scenes to hilarious effect. In fact, there\u2019s a character in this show whose movements almost always comprise of ridiculous paper-like movements that consist of minimal movement in terms of frames. It doesn\u2019t look fluid in the least but it somehow fits. You\u2019d understand if you see it for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, since the show doesn\u2019t actually possess terrific animation throughout, I\u2019ll have to lower its score in this category a bit. It gets a 6.5/10 for its animation.\\n\\n\r\n----Soundtrack----\\n\r\nI don\u2019t really need to speak much when it comes to its sountrack. I\u2019m personally a big fan and I think its OST was downright amazing. Character themes fit and the background OST is almost never off the mark. A definite 10/10 on this front.\\n\\n\r\n----Characters----\\n\r\nThey\u2019re all fairly good with a decent amount of backstory \u2013 a sufficient amount which is JUST right. The characters that stand out are definitely Ryuko, Satsuki and Mako. Former two are the main characters of the series and rivals. They\u2019re always at each other\u2019s throats \u2013 as if fated to be enemies. These two receive the most screen-time. Ryuko, the MC, faces problems like identity crisis and goes berserk a few times. The story is ~apparently~ supposed to be a coming-of-age story so a teenage girl having a lot of mood-swings and being very impulsive in nature probably doesn\u2019t seem out-of-character. But she can be annoying to some due to it anyway. I personally found it really annoying when she had an outburst in episode 19. Mostly because she has had similar outbursts not too long ago. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nMako, on the other hand, is more of a comedic side-kick than a main character. She is eccentric and hyperactive. Her gags can be hit or miss for people depending on their perspective. Personally found her and her antics highly enjoyable and a breath of fresh air when compared to contemporary sidekicks. There are two more that I would love to talk about but I shall not because they\u2019re integral to the plot and disclosing information about them could be considered a spoiler. Anyway, as far as character development is concerned, it is present, yes. But not *too* much of it. The only character in the series that gets proper development in this series is Ryuko\u2019s rival, Kiryuin Satsuki. Ryuko, on the other hand, pales in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series consists of a highly female-oriented cast. The males are present, yeah, but it is the women who possess boobs of steel, strength and ambition to do things their way. \\n\\n\r\nIt gets a 7/10 in this category.\\n\\n\r\n----Story----\\n\r\nA pretty simple set-up. And a very entertaining story. There were a few ups and downs between episodes 7 and 15 but the series has managed to be highly entertaining for the most part. Do not go into it expecting it to be a deep story and you\u2019ll probably have a lot of fun. It starts off with a monster of the week format, goes on with it for a few episodes, and then shifts gears. It is only after episode 12 that some revelations come to light and we come to know more about the big shots. And not before episode 15 does the series start having some serious plot progression. Before episode 15 the series did possess a very chaotic pacing as far as events-per-episode are concerned but the rate of overall plot progression was very slow. Which led some fans to say \u201cYou haven\u2019t TRULY seen Kill la Kill if you haven\u2019t seen past episode 15 yet\u201d. And I\u2019m inclined to agree with them to a degree. The series does pick up quite a bit after that. Don\u2019t expect a shit-ton of character development or earth-shattering revelations , though. It is all pretty predictable. What make the things that take place in these episodes so damn effective is the execution \u2013 Trigger does an amazing job at showing off predictable events in an unpredictable fashion. They\u2019re masters when it comes to it and it makes the recent episodes look really, really good when compared to the episodes that precede them. It ends on a satisfying note, too. Slightly disappointing if you are expecting things to escalate to infinity and beyond but, like I said, its end is definitely not something you\u2019d consider a bad end. It wraps up things nicely. Of course, there are a few loose ends and things that you\u2019d consider plot-holes but they\u2019re mostly minor for the most part and story was never its strength anyway. I\u2019ll conclude by saying that it turns out VERY different from how it starts off. You probably won\u2019t believe the first and last episodes are parts of the same show if they didn\u2019t share characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it gets a 6.5/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\n----Final Thoughts----\\n\r\nI think this is definitely a series worth checking out. Do not expect it to be anything \u2013 just judge it for what it is rather than for what it could\u2019ve been or what you wanted it to be. A series with a good art style and creative yet dramatic cuts, amazing soundtrack, a fun cast and just over-the-top action. Definitely check it out if you\u2019re into action anime. Or if you are just looking for an over-the-top series that isn\u2019t afraid of doing things that are considered very far-fetched or out-of-the-box. \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating \u2013 7/10. The rating takes enjoyment into account as well. Although I personally have it listed as a 9/10 on my list because I\u2019m highly biased when it comes to this show. I did try to keep my personal bias away from this review, though. And I hope I was successful in that regard \u2013 please provide feedback and let me know whether or not that was the case. Both helpful and unhelpful votes are appreciated as long as you guys let me know the +ves and \u2013ves of this review to me on my profile. Thank you for reading and I hope I was helpful.",

            "content": "Kill La Kill is the first original work from Trigger, a studio founded by a couple former Gainax employees. It ran from October of last year to March of this year. Its head writer was Nakashima Kazuki, who was also one of the series writers for Gurren Lagann. So, how did Trigger's initial foray into an original series go? \r\nStory:\r\nOur tale opens with the militant Honnouji Academy getting a new transfer student. Enter our protagonist, Matoi Ryuuko. She's traveled across the country looking for leads about her father's killer. The trail has led to Honnouji, where the student counsel President, Satsuki, rules with an ironfist and students' positions in her hierarchy determine where they can live and what kinds of jobs their families can hold. Ryuuko demands answers from Satsuki only to be beaten by one of her minions who's using a magic uniform that grants him superhuman powers. Yes, the premise really involves magical clothing. \\n\\n\r\nRyuuko slinks back to her father's burnt lab, falling through a trap door. Inside she finds a magic sailor uniform that talks to her and grants her super powers but needs her blood to activate. Ryuuko decides to put an end to Satsuki's ambitions and force her to tell the truth about her father's death. But the secret of Honnouji Academy goes far deeper than she realises. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this story is pretty weak and largely just serves to transport Ryuuko from one over the top action or comedic sequence to the next. The plot twists come out of nowhere with nothing foreshadowing them whatsoever, but a lot of them are really predictable in spite of that simply because they're really clich\u00e9. The attempts at comedy fall short as well, usually being based on either the idea that nudity is funny or rambling that borders on incoherent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe only characters who even gravitate towards two dimensions are Satsuki and Ryuuko, the rest are firmly rooted one-dimensional archetypes. Whether it's the friend, the loyal minion, the bloke who loves to fight or something else entirely. The only thing that really sets them apart from the usual archetype is that they're more over the top. Kill La Kill subscribes to the notion that subtlety and depth are unnecessary. It just tries to exaggerate the casts' archetypal qualities to make them the most extreme versions it possibly can. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this looks pretty bad. The characters look like blank-faced action figures with proportions out of a bad 90s comic. The action sequences are frequently difficult to follow with an over-emphasis on flashy effects and special attacks that just strain your eyes more often than not. \\n\\n\r\nThe outfits are really fan-servicey as well, but I'm pretty certain the designs are being used in an attempt at comedy. Both because the art style does not lend itself to actual fan-service and because the anime draws attention to how ridiculous the outfits are on several occasions. The problem is the execution. Everything is ridiculously exaggerated in this anime so the over the top fan-service doesn't come across as tonally different from anything else, be it serious or not. Furthermore, while a joke at the expense of how ridiculous fan-service can be could work in a short piece or when used sparingly in a longer work, the series is decently long with twenty four episodes, all of which keep the same ridiculous outfits. If they wanted them to serve as a parody, they really should have replaced them with something actually practical instead of coming up with a contrived excuse for why they couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is awful. Like the art, story and characters, it's ridiculously exaggerated. The actors usually sound like they're reading off of their scripts as quickly as they can with little to no range of emotion. The actors who get it the worst are Suzaki Aya, Shintani Mayumi and Hiyama Nobuyuki. It doesn't help that Hiyama is the only one of those three I've heard in roles that required actual acting skill. That being said, the series also has Seki Toshihiko, Yuzuki Ryoka, Koshimizu Ami and Tamura Yukari all of whom are very good, but you wouldn't know that with their performances in this. So, it is very likely a fault with the direction. The music is kind of generic action fare. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe ho-yay factor is a 4/10. Things get pretty homo-erotic between Mako and Ryuuko. Satsuki and Nonon are also implied to be more than friends. Nui is openly into other girls, even getting a kiss scene at one point. Then you have Ragyou, who gropes her own daughter in several different scenes. To be fair to Kill La Kill, these scenes are supposed to be creepy and are played up as such.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this is the fourth anime I've seen in a row that's had incestuous content to some degree. What's next, a boy having a crush on a clone of his mum? Would any series really be that stupid? \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is a mindless, over the top, action series. This \u201cover the top\u201d aesthetic does give the series something different from the usual mindless action schlock, but I'm not sure if that's to its benefit. It's not even over the top in an enjoyable way like Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It's just mind-numbingly stupid in terms of plot, characters, art and acting but at least it's relatively harmless. If you're a fan of that kind of exaggerated comedy, you might enjoy it. If you aren't, there's really nothing that this series can offer you. My final rating is going to be a 3/10. Next week, I'll look at Neon Genesis Evangelion.",

            "content": "When everything is said and done, anime only has one purpose: to entertain. If it fails to do so, it is deemed exactly so, and those who strive to create such entertainment shy away from the subject as a result. On the contrary, if a single anime is deemed so entertaining by the masses that they are willing to rip each other to pieces in order to get a glimpse of what more could be done with the series, those who strive to create such entertainment might feel pressured into doing so out of obligation and greed, rather than for the intended purpose. While thiscontinues to happen, the quality of certain series only continue to skyrocket with each sequel. If there were any series that were to come out within the last couple years that I feel deserves to be left untouched, it would be Kill la Kill, studio Trigger's very first anime blockbuster.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is the creation of director Hiroyuki Imaishi, who is most known for directing titles such as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Panty Stocking and Garterbelt. What becomes common knowledge while watching Imaishi's works is that he has a tendency to overexaggerate. Fight scenes, overall animation and design, fan service, and story telling are a few notable examples of subjects that Imaishi toys with in every creation. This trend isn't broken in Kill la Kill, as the very beginning sequence shows. No context, no background checks, just a quick overview of what the viewer comes to witness and the story begins. While intimidating, this type of story telling can benefit the viewer by baiting them into feeling more immersed in the story, as if they were actually there, as ignorant as the youthful characters within the series. The only information given at the beginning of the series is that Honnouji Academy, a school grounds of epic proportions, is being run by a terrorizing force in Satsuki Kiryuuin. The only thing in her way is Ryuuko Matoi, a strong, developing individual who suddenly appears in Honnouji Academy to search for her father's murderer.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Kill la Kill grows as with its progression, ultimately becoming more substantial than anyone starting the series could ever imagine. The other thing that comes with this type of plot is the magnitude of unrealistic situations. No matter the event, Kill la Kill ultimately can't escape some of the shounen cliches that it means to spoof, leaving them in a state of laughing at their own misery. However, what the series does so well all throughout is hold its ground; no matter what happens, the characters, the plot, the animation, all will make it through to the end, by any means possible. What Kill la Kill accomplishes with this is what was meant to be accomplished in Imaishi's other series: entertaining the viewer through sheer spectacle. Despite the plot's flaws and unrealistic qualms, the story is entertaining to view from every standpoint, even from the stingiest of mindsets.\\n\\n\r\nThose who inhabit such a sporadic plot are sure to be colorful, right? To varying degree, the series does well in creating characters who match the overall tone. Ryuuko Matoi is the main heroine of the series, and that role is never relinquished, even in times of hardship. Her growth as a character is only slightly embellished, while her overall progression of strength may seem strange to some. Mako Mankanshoku, Ryuuko's friend and the show's main source of comedy, is the epitome of what kind of character can evolve from the rapid-paced animation of Kill la Kill. Very rarely is she shown in a normal state of balance, always bouncing off of walls and displaying unrealistic feats of human biology. She's legitimately funny, which is always nice to see from a longer-running series. Satsuki Kiryuuin as a villain is about as grand a performance as any series could ever hope to accomplish. She sticks to her beliefs and crushes those who oppose her, even those who were at one point accepting of her rule. Her cold demeanor makes her somewhat disheartening as an overall character, but, along with Ryuuko, Satsuki becomes just as three-dimensional as any valid character. The side characters serve their roles well, but almost never stray out of it, almost as if the very thought would kill them instantly. With a series like this, it wouldn't surprise me. Regardless, every character feels genuinely important to the plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat fully deserves a round of applause from every person within an Earth-sized radius of the North Pole is the animation. It's rare to see so much effort put into the fluidity of the animation. The fight scenes are flashy and well drawn. The characters' designs are interesting, along with every outfit they choose to wear. The only thing I could care to point out is that when compared to high-quality works of this time period, Kill la Kill seems almost old-fashioned, but that might be a point in of itself. Most, if not all, entertainment derived from this show can be traced back to how fluid and smooth on the eyes the art style is. If one were allowed to mention one key point about Kill la Kill as a whole, animation might be a common choice.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing about Kill la Kill's art style is the amount of fan service present within each episode. While, admittedly, the first few episodes almost relied on it, the connection to the characters and the focus on the plot almost makes one forget that they're basically fighting naked. The outfits worn by each character are so stylishly designed, I'd even suggest that what isn't shown of the female body is almost more alluring than what is. A distraction from the distraction, if you will. Using fan service from one taste to combat fan service from another taste. Kill la Kill is just as much a battle of where to pay attention as it is a battle against characters.\\n\\n\r\nA series as entertaining as Kill la Kill is bound to give pressure to its creators to create something just as amazing, if not better, than what they can handle. They could always try to appease their appetite with an appetizer, such as an elongated OVA or a few movies, but to recreate the magic that Kill la Kill left within an audience will be a difficult task to accomplish, if they decide to continue the series. Whatever they choose to do, Kill la Kill is enough to leave any fan either clamoring for more or feeling satisfied with a creatively diverse story. Despite some issues with realism, every question that arose with Trigger's first official tv series, whether it be its ability to entertain or its animation skills, were checked off with every passing episode, and met with a solid following.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is the most ridiculously absurd, incredibly shallow, quickly paced, and unconstitutionally brainless show that I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  The show works, and it works well.  Almost every episode has a hype quotient far beyond anything I've ever seen.  The reason it's such a great show is because you watch an episode and are constantly fed nonstop craziness, and its just barrels of fun to watch.  Let's break it down.\r\nStory: 8\r\nAlright, so normally I wouldn't give a story like this an 8.  There's a lot of plotholes, there's a lot to be desired, and thestory is very typical.  At the same time, it's fast-paced nonstop action, mixed in with an absolutely absurd plot with plenty of twists in turns.  It helps not to look into it too much.  The show is a lot of fun and action, it's got moments of drama and seriousness, and looking into it too much just makes it less fun for you.  If you're planning on getting technical about it and bringing the story in for review by critics, you're not going to have a good time.  If you're going to watch the show and scream \"FUCK YEAH\" when something awesome happens and let your cynicism melt away, the drama will be intense and the storyline epic, it's really up to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best parts.  The backgrounds are beautiful, the characters have nice designs, and the whole show is basically about clothes, and the designs of the outfits were also well done.  The art is a little risque at times, but in terms of pure quality, the animation varies from humorously bad to scary good.  The fight scenes are outstanding and deserve all the praise they get.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like the soundtrack, I'm afraid you may have lost your way.  The soundtrack of the show is incredible, the song choices are impeccable, and the music always adds to the crazy levels of hype and excitement that each episode brings.  The soundtrack is truly one of the crowning features of the show, with plenty of songs that are amazing outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved every character (well, loved in a 'they were a good character' way), all the main ones were well-written, though at times a little cliche, but there wasn't really a character that didn't pull their weight.  The interactions between them are fun to watch, their motivations and values are clear, and they act consistently for the most part.  There's clear development, and they all bring something new to the table.  The villains are intimidating, the heroes were endearing and had depth and unique personalities, and the supporting characters were also fun to watch and were given their own personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a show that was meant to be enjoyed.  It wasn't designed to make you ponder life, or to make you cry or feel emotions, or to make some sort of political statement, or even to provide a storyline that was intriguing enough to warrant coming back each week.  It's pure, unadulterated fun, and at the end of the episode I never failed to want more.  It's like candy, light, tasty, enjoyable and leaves you wanting more.  There's a reason that the hype train for this show never stops, and it's because the hype never ends, it just gets more intense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally award tens, but I'm making an exception.  I thoroughly enjoyed each and every second of Kill la kill.  It was crazy, it shoved fan-service into my face, and exaggerated fights as far as possible.  In the end, I just wish there was more.  The characters were all wonderful, and even a sailor uniform becomes lovable.  All in all, Kill la Kill is something you watch when you want to have fun and get excited, and it succeeded so well in doing that that it deserves a ten.  I make a point to grade shows based on what they were aiming for or what their purpose or goal is, and Kill la Kill was perfect in that regard.  It has truly saved anime.",

            "content": "[9.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nKill la Kill is not a stupid show. I want to draw this line now. A stupid show is one that blatantly contradicts its established settings or fails to draw verisimilitude by continually destroying its own lack of believability within the world it created. From the very first episode, the world of Kill la Kill remained intact and it never strained my disbelief. This show is silly, not stupid. It revels in its ridiculousness because, as this show blatantly states multiple times, that is the world they live in. It is ridiculous, absurd, and every synonym in between. The premise of the universe is, afterall, based on a pun. Well, two puns.\\n\\n\r\nSince Kill la Kill\u2019s world is surrounded around the concept of clothing and what they fundamentally mean, whether it is their show of power or submission, the writers at Trigger elevate that. Fashion, in Japanese, is spelt exactly like fascist, which is an ongoing motif and trait in many of the characters. While the term Seifuku, means both uniform and conquest. Which is also an important theme within the universe in Kill la Kill. With this in mind, every revelation, however absurd and over-the-top, still remains believable within the rules and structure of the world, therefore maintaining the verisimilitude created in the first episode. Put simply, it is ridiculous and silly, but not stupid. \\n\\n\r\nEven throughout the show as characters grow and spawn new tools of destruction seemingly at whim, the ideas and themes persist. One may argue that nonsensical elevation is inherently stupid, as it strains the viewers preconceived notions of what is relatable, while I believe that the world within a show or film can be as ludicrous as the creators want, as long as the characters remain grounded, however insane their outward appearance may be. Characters, after all, make the setting, not vice versa. Characters are the most important element to long-form storytelling and are single-handedly responsible for most viewer\u2019s connection to the story being told. Kill la Kill is at its best when it is exploring its characters motivations, revelations, and ideals through outlandish set pieces and outrageous dialogue. This elevates this seemingly simple story of revenge to something special. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Themes of an Indulgent World]\\n\\n\r\nThe first, and probably most standout element of the show is its immediate hook. The idea that this world runs of clothes and how this simple concept progressively becomes elevated by clashing ideals. This universe, created by the staff at Trigger is intrinsically indulgent due to its focus on scantily clad girls fighting in massive arenas. It further elevates its indulgence by making it so everyone is scantily clad. Equal opportunity fan service. The simple idea is that it is humanity, as in, the body you are born with, is worth fighting over the restrictive, controlling nature of clothing, as it hides who you are. This base theme that permeates throughout Kill la Kill is the driving force of its indulgence. \\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding this, you begin to comprehend the rules that you will be seeing sprout throughout the series. The elements being foreshadowed from earlier episodes coming to fruition later on in this show is a staple, which overjoyed me because a lot of anime I\u2019ve seen seems to lack the concept of foreshadowing. The idea of sex and body positivity encompasses Kill la Kill and I couldn\u2019t be happier. All of a sudden, the potentially over-indulgent shots of our heroines toned figure becomes something to cheer on, rather than roll your eyes at. \\n\\n\r\nThis idea is something I touched on while discussing Prison School. Sex shouldn\u2019t be demonized. Showing the beauty of the human body is a positive and should remain so. However, sacrificing characters, story, and believability for some marketing based on a bunch of colorful waifu-bait girls? Now that is where my problem with a lot of anime comes in. It isn\u2019t that the buzzword \u201cfanservice\u201d is something I hate; it is the exploitative nature of it that is over-utilized and simply doesn\u2019t belong in many of the areas which is encompasses.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill subverts this entire notion by making the entire world it is set in like this. Nudity is not just a theme, but an ideal that all our protagonists end up believing in. Not nudity in the sexual light, but nudity in the human light. Being naked drifts away from being crude and over-indulgent to being the norm in this show, and I believe that this was exactly the point. It was a clever way to still market these attractive characters while still forging a new kind of story that I have yet been seen in anime. \\n\\n\r\nMeta-narrative is nothing new, but the general focus in anime on it has been criticism of these elements while still undoubtedly doing them. Trigger doesn\u2019t criticize as much as it indulges in, and does incredibly well. By creating a world focused solely on battling clothes, they draft the schematics for applicability in the skin they want to desperately show and market. This is genius. I\u2019ve never seen a show that wears its base notions its sleeve. I shouldn\u2019t even say that. I\u2019ve never seen a show that fully embraces what it is in world, characters, and themes, so much so that feels like I\u2019m watching a show that is naked. In the end, that is the point. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Characters within a Naked World]\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in my introduction, the characters are this show's strongest parts, and Kill la Kill has no end to strong elements. Following our unusual protagonist, Ryuuko Matoi, who dawns one-half a scissor blade crafted by her mysterious father. She finds her way to Honnouji Academy, which is ruled by student body president Satsuki Kiryuuin. She proceeds to meet all sorts of wonderful characters, such as the elite four student body council, as well as her best friend Mako Mankonshoku. She is also forms a bond with the one other item crafted by her father, the life-fiber suit, Senketsu. We are then swept away on a journey to discovering who her father was, why she lost him, and who she is. \\n\\n\r\nThen this show surprised me. Rounding out the shows first arc, which lead into the mid-show finale, I realized that I have never quite been invested in a Shounen action anime before. I never connected with the characters and I never cared for the overly-righteous moralizing that they all seem to love. However, rounding out this first arc I actually felt the urge to press on and watch episode after episode, fully invested in what is happening. Not because the story being told was something astounding, but because the characters surrounding this story are, in my opinion, the best anime characters I\u2019ve ever seen. That is as simply as I can put it without spoiling too much. There was something hard to pinpoint which made them so likeable, endearing, but more importantly, thematically and dramatically engaging. It is that I began realizing that the antagonists this show was focusing on weren\u2019t really as antagonistic as I initially expected.\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of moral grey, without completely converting characters into the moralistic attitude of the protagonist, is what is genuinely lacking in so many action anime that I\u2019ve seen. Perhaps I\u2019ve been stricken with bad luck and hopefully more shows are like this, but so many anime seems to revel in black and white morals that they instantly become too easy to \u201cget\u201d, and completely unrealistic in terms of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nIn Kill la Kill, the base antagonists within the shows first half haven\u2019t done anything that is completely antagonistic. Specifically, Satsuki who is my favorite character in the show, becomes so tragic and understandable without actually expositing why. So, when the narrative elements become clear, you feel like this show succeeded in portraying the inner-emotion behind her without spelling them out for you. I\u2019ll say this again; I have never seen an anime do something like this. Satsuki and her eyebrows are the most captivating part of the show and what ultimately make the final battle being fought palatable to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict becomes one of ideals in the first half, which leads to a true threat being endlessly more imposing. It manifests itself with Ragyou Kiryuuin, Satsuki\u2019s mother, who is, in my opinion, one of the most effective villains I\u2019ve ever seen in anime as well. This is simply because the pains she\u2019s caused is towards characters I\u2019m affectionate towards, rather than characters I\u2019m forced to feel affectionate towards. That is an important distinction to draw. I started caring about these characters before the show exposited why I should, and that is perhaps the show's strongest moment. Ragyou does things that are brutally difficult to watch simply because they are done to characters I like. This has never actually happened to me before in action anime and it constantly left my jaw dropped after these later episodes finished. The feeling of empathy and ultimate catharsis was much bigger than I could ever anticipate from a show like this, which made it more memorable. Ragyou\u2019s parallels to real world fascism relate back to the base thematic elements of Kill la Kill, as well. I remember one scene which explained Satsuki\u2019s disdain towards a previously established element and eventual lashing out, filled me with emotion and anger. This felt so refreshing to me, as I\u2019ve never had those feelings while watching a shounen action anime.  \\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of episodes, there are plenty of thematic reversals which feel ultimately earned due to how much pathos ends up being felt towards many of these characters, specifically Satsuki. Trigger did a standout job with the characters. Even a lot of the secondary\u2019s had enough quirks to them to make them likeable enough to care about, simply through the situations, both comedic and serious, they went through to bond with one another. Another character that could\u2019ve easily fallen into the \u201ctoo random and annoying to be useful\u201d category of eccentric anime girls is Mako, who ends up actually providing more to this show than I initially expected. I ended up really enjoying her presence and levity. The ability to mix brutal seriousness with relieving gags is what makes Kill la Kill standout.  I cannot give enough praise to this element of the show. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Presentation]\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn\u2019t have a large budget. In fact, I\u2019d say that it operates on a budget, but more importantly, a time frame that is significantly smaller than it needs. However, that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being visually pleasing and creating magnificent set-pieces. I want to make it clear, it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of budget you are working on as much as it matters how much talent and effort the animators put into what they are working on. Budget, as it is, only affects the ability to hire people, not the actual quality of the work being produced. Time is the essence to creating something beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Kill la Kill does is utilize its integrally bizarre world for comedy. This show tries, and mostly succeeds, at being funny. Not just because it crafts funny characters, such as Mako, but because it indulges in its theme so much that it just becomes funny to watch. This is shown through presentation, which is great. The lack of time and budget can still craft elegant scenes, but also, more commonly, crudely animated humorous scenes. Instead of hiding it, much like everything else, Trigger embraces this aspect and with it, and creates some of the most memorable scenes and sequences I\u2019ve ever seen in anime. Whether it is the way a certain character gets thrown off the edge, or the jolt-y and convincing demonstration of Mako\u2019s ideals, to the random bouts of beautifully animated frame-by-frame moments which stick out like sore thumbs, but also fit perfectly in rhythm with the entire show. No television anime usually operates on a huge budget or on a huge time-frame, but Kill la Kill uses its restraints like a trampoline.\\n\\n\r\nThis is further exemplified by the stylistic elements. The over-abundance of still-frame poses as letters fly on screen signifying a new ability or character introduction to the capacity to convey a character's position within the story simply through their movement, or lack thereof. Kill la Kill plays with scale a lot, which is really fascinating to look at. Characters have various different heights they can manifest in simply through their position of power. The show is often very detailed in what it shows in the background, as well. There are so many funny details being shoved into the back of the show that I believe it will warrant a great re-watch. These details show just how much Trigger cared about what they are creating. This is a passion project through-and-through. Much like the themes in the show, this ability to embrace the flaws makes them positives, which is a wholly unique approach I can\u2019t help but praise. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Audio]\\n\\n\r\nThe music is yet another standout element to Kill la Kill. This show may have the best OST I\u2019ve heard in anime so far. While both intro and credits songs aren\u2019t all too interesting, in my opinion, where this show more than makes up for this is in the wonderful backing tracks that are played throughout the show. Specifically, Nui Harime, a character introduced later in the show has a spectacularly eerie and bad-ass theme song that exemplifies her character perfectly. Ragyou also has, what I want to call the best theme song out of any character I\u2019ve ever heard in anime. Her song, Blumenkranz, is a Japanese sung German track that not only draws further parallels to fascism, but also sounds epic and suitably vocal to the kind of sadistic character she is.\\n\\n\r\nOther audio elements are naturally impressive as well. The crisp whizzing of bullets, or whatever the show uses as bullets, whether it is needles or money, to the thundering explosions are all well-mixed and never quiet enough to be un-impactful. The show also utilizes a lot of sound effects, mostly for comedy, which thankfully are about as over-the-top as the show itself. Much like in something like Avatar:The last Airbender, the sound effects went from annoying to endearing just as my enjoyment of the characters increased. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Eventual Mistakes]\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show is overall amazing, that doesn\u2019t exempt it from various issues that spring up. Thankfully, none of them are too major, however, they are worth mentioning. One of the biggest issues with having an OP and ED that aren\u2019t too great, in my opinion, is that they can create some tonal whiplash. Especially the second ED is especially strange, as it is when the shows stakes become increased, the ED is strangely light-hearted and poppy. The cliff-hanger endings aren\u2019t backed up well by the eventual ED coming in which, as I said, creates a sort of whiplash that shifts the portrayed emotions too quickly. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also a few scenes where the show ventures into self-aware territory that don\u2019t feel earned. A few moments where they call out the monologuing that is done in many anime without actually subverting the scene. It is that \u201chaving the cake and eating it too\u201d aspect that annoys me in a lot of meta-dialogue in many different anime that I\u2019ve seen. There isn\u2019t any subversion happening. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, the ending few episodes play out a lot like both many shounen anime, and like Gurren Lagann, another show that studio Trigger worked on. While I found myself enjoying Kill la Kill more overall, the striking similarities sometimes felt inadvertent, which created an odd sense of treading water. While the investment in these characters made these final episodes palatable and competent, even if the cinematic nature of it wasn\u2019t overly interesting to me. Once again, the characters elevated what is being shown.  \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nClothes versus humanity. A strange topic to be sure. Kill la Kill mixes self-aware dialogue with overt indulgence with its genres clich\u00e9s. This show has a lot of smart themes hidden within its silly dialogue and sillier set pieces that will, without a doubt, go unnoticed by many of its audience there for the action or comedy. Kill la Kill\u2019s ability to keep some if its more narratively intriguing characters not morally obvious is the show\u2019s most interesting part. The viewers gradual understanding of the shows initial antagonist is crucial to developing your own sense of sympathy and connection with the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of narrative hints and, honestly, surprisingly subtle storytelling to be seen. Another, less obvious theme being the removal of purity, portrayed by sexual deviance and overt hedonism. A viewer wouldn\u2019t find this meaning unless they are searching for it, which makes the eventual realization that it is being portrayed all the more rewarding. Conceptually, a lot of the shounen I\u2019ve seen now feel tepid compared to Kill la Kill. This show\u2019s superb character design and characterization keeps everyone you meet instantly memorable. Even our protagonist, Ryuuko, is often shown as someone that isn\u2019t necessarily meant to be agreed with. Not in the usual context, too, which is often just naivety. While her arc isn\u2019t as interesting as her rival, Satsuki\u2019s, it most definitely does enough to put her up there with some of the more engaging leads within Shounen anime. Her relationship with Senketsu and Mako is great, as well. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill may be seen as overly farcical, absurd, and too fast-paced for many, however, the positives of this series put it in the pantheon of some of the best anime I\u2019ve seen. Its ability to be thematically poignant while still delivering high-octane action that is completely in-line with what you\u2019d usually see in shounen action, even if it is stylistically superior in just about every way, is what leads me to believe that Kill la Kill is the perfect example of what shounen can be. It has what many similar anime don\u2019t have. Characters which are endlessly more interesting due to their dramatic depth and ability to not moralize just about everything being shown. Kill la Kill harbors self-awareness not just in the humor, but in the entire concept. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea that something must be sexualized to be marketable is this show's greatest indulgence. However, it still manages to comment on the concept as well. In one specific moment, Ragyou observes how the hardest demographic to dominate is the teen one, referring to how she is proceeding to take over the world with clothes. The lack of clothes attracts the teenagers. Maybe the show is playing the villain here. Maybe it is the hedonistic force that it criticizes, as well as promotes the idea of body positivity and sex. It draws a distinct line between what is human and what is clothes, clothes being the idea of something made. Something used by humans to control. The lack of clothes used to attract. Whatever meaning you can siphon from this is your own, but just the fact that it is there is impressive to me. In an industry where light meta-jokes are the norm and the inability to fully criticize something without doing it yourself is rampant. Kill la Kill dons another kind of appearance. One of embracing the indulgence and creating something new in an industry full of old, worn, and ragged ideas. \\n",

            "content": "Why can't stories be fun anymore? Why must a majority of shows and books be washed with dark themes and tones? Now I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy some darker stories. Hell, some of my favorites, in and out of anime, are rather dark themselves. But what makes those stories good in the first place is the high quality of writing that brought out the potential of the darker themes and tones. After all, the dark stories that lack actual writing talent almost always turn out abysmal. Likewise, it seems that the majority of the stories we get nowadays that attempt tobe fun are riddled with groan-worthy jokes, the same repeated plot in different form, and the attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator, the tits and ass crowd. But it's not like this is new. For years, it's been like this. Yet, every now and then, we get a truly fun show that towers over the rest. When School Days plagued us with it's hate-filled contrivance, we had Baccano to combat it. When Air Gear tortured us with an onslaught of ecchi and stupidity, we had Ouran High School Host Club to show them how it's really done. So, when shows like Diabolik Lovers and the return of Valvrave the Liberator were upon us, and Samurai Flamenco failed us, who would step up to the plate to show what it truly meant to have fun? It's time, for Kill la Kill. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins in the future of, what appears to be, an alternative world to ours. In this world, Nazi Germany won the war, or at least it's implied, and Fascism reins supreme. In Japan, there lies Honnouji Academy, ruled by it's iron-fisted student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin. At Honnouji, the students are divided by rank, in the form of stars, and your social class reflects the amount of stars you have. Not only that, but the higher ranked students are given specialized uniforms, known as Goku uniforms, that enhance their own physical abilities, with the highest ranked students having the most powerful uniforms. One day, this organized society has a wrench thrown in it's works when a girl wielding a scissor blade, named Ryuko Matoi, enrolls in Honnouji, looking for answers involving her fathers murder. As she spends more time at Honnouji, her path crosses with Satsuki Kiryuin, she partners up with a living sailor uniform named Senketsu, and finds a friend in the schools nut job, Mako Mankanshoku. But as she goes deeper into the conspiracies, she's forced to confront the one thing she's been searching for this whole time. The truth. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell by the description, one thing you can't call Kill la Kill is unoriginal. What you can call it weird, crazy, over the top, eccentric, and silly among other things. But one thing that I rarely hear anyone call Kill la Kill, is smart. In fact, many people often describe it as mindless or stupid. I find this kind of sad considering that Kill la Kill is, in fact, smarter than many people will give it credit for. Kill la Kill is, in fact an allegory. For those who don't know, an allegory is an extended metaphor with hidden meaning, conveyed through characters and symbols. For reference, some other examples of allegories in anime are Wolf's Rain and Revolutionary Girl Utena. Kill la Kill often provides scenes, actions, and symbols that are meant to represent different forms of control, fascism being the obvious one, but others including indoctrination, traditionalist bigotry, and plutocracy, and these are shown to paint a picture of the conformist dictatorship that the world, or at least Japan, has submitted to. I'm actually surprised that many will write this off, considering that the symbolism and metaphor in Kill la Kill is some of the most blatant that i've ever come across. \\n\\n\r\nYes, Kill la Kill is smart and clever, but it's in no way deep or complex, and you don't have to work all that much to find meaning in it. But that's not really a bad thing, because the show is still meaningful in just how sincere it is in its endeavors. The ideas are simple and the writing is straightforward, but it's all done incredibly well. But it's not exactly necessary for you to notice these touches, because the show is so fun that you can enjoy it regardless. Yes the action, which can be best described as visual insanity, the humor, which is downright silly in the best way, and the ideas, which you should already be able to tell are strange and creative, is just so enjoyable that it's hard to not end an episode, particularly the later episodes, feeling starry-eyed and wanting more. Sadly this isn't true from start to finish. The show gets off to a rather weak start, with plenty of info dumping and cliches tossed left and right in the first episode. But it continues to improve with each episode, until the epic climax that made my jaw hurt from the giant grin I was wearing the entire time. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is brought to us by the good people at studio Trigger, the new anime studio that was founded by former Gainax employees, and it also serves as their first televised series. Before I can actually talk about the animation quality of the show though, I have to talk about the director. The director, and co-founder of Trigger, Hiroyuki Imaishi was best known for his directorial works on Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt, and the massive success known as Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann. His style often consists of grand scale settings, over the top action scenes, and just plain insanity that borders on nonsensical, and I have to say, I think Kill la Kill probably accomplished his style better than any of his other past shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch when it needs to be, but often needs to cut corners. However it's hard to take points off for this when they cut corners in all the right places, to the point where the untrained eye might not even notice the drop in quality to begin with. When the animation does decide to shine though, it's truly a visual marvel, making for some top notch actions scenes. There's plenty of detail put into this show too. It might take a little while to notice it, but there is always something going on on-screen, whether it be simple visual gags, or just little subtle touches that make a scene just a bit more prominent. You can tell there was a lot of time and care put into the visuals of this show.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, anyone's who's watched Kill la Kill, or even just knows a little about it, knows that you can't talk about the visuals without bringing up the f-word. Fanservice. Yes, Kill la Kill has scantily clad girls in it, sometimes even fully naked women in it. However, I don't see this as a flaw. Putting aside for a second that the fanservice is actually a plot point and connects to the shows themes both symbolically and metaphorically, I'm being completely serious, there are still two reasons why I will defend it. First, one look at the character designs should tell you, this fanservice is meant to look silly not sexy. The character designs are very cartoonish, with hardly any detail put into their, well, assets, and there is no attempt to make them look like wank bait. Second, even if you don't agree with my first point, I should point out that Kill la Kill has an equal amount of manservice. Yes for every half naked girl, there is a fully naked guy showing off his buff body. So, at the very least, you can't accuse the show of only trying to appeal to a certain audience. The only fanservice scenes I have issue with are the ones between Satsuki and her mother Ragyo. I understand that it's supposed to represent Ragyo showing dominance through sexuality, which is certainly nothing new, and that they were intended to be creepy, which actually works in a way. But there was no need to have 4 entire scenes of Ragyo molesting her daughter. Even so, that's just four scenes compared to 24 entire episodes. Kill la Kill, while not dazzling or progressive in it's visuals, still proves itself to be a visual marvel in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAYYYYY!!\u201d- Before My Body Is Dry\\n\\n\r\nEvery good anime needs a good OST to deliver in the context of the show it's accompanying. So for Kill la Kill's soundtrack to be good, we'd need it to be over-the-top, insane, somewhat cheesy, diverse, loud, and unforgettable. Luckily Hiroyuki Sawano, the show's composer, does not fail to deliver. There's a certain charm to the shows soundtrack that only grows on you further and further as they smartly place the most blood-pumping and spine-chilling songs at the most excessive parts of the show's action scenes and the most thrilling parts of the shows turns. From the stupidly awesome Til My Body Is Dry, to the subdued I Want To Know, and of course the fan favorite, the soft yet chilling German aria, Blumencranz. It's no surprise that the OST has even seen stateside success with Aniplex's release of it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, there is no dub as of this review, though there will certainly be one at a later date, so there isn't too much to say. As for the quality of the Japanese track, it's excessive, it's hammy, and it's impressionable. In other words, it fits the show perfectly. I admit, and I've said this before in the past, it's a bit hard for a non-japanese speaker like me to fully judge a japanese performance, but it's clear that the seiyu of the show were able to deliver a passionate performance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cNot making sense is kind of our thing\u201d- Ryuko Matoi\\n\\n\r\nI've said before in the past that, at times, simplicity can work better than complexity. Sometimes, all a character needs is to be well-defined and engaging. In that sense, Kill la Kill passes with flying colors. Most, if not all, of the shows characters start off as the haggard old archetypes we've seen a million times before. Ryuko is the hotheaded rebel, Satsuki is the prideful ice queen, Mako is the out of this world best friend/comic relief, Senketsu is a blood-sucking sailor uniform........okay maybe not all of the characters are haggard old archetypes. But what sets them apart from their archetypes, is that every character in this show has purpose, both to the story and to themselves. Each is written with unique motivations, goals, and flaws that make the cast far more fleshed out then I thought was possible when I started the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis is only furthered by the show's theme of individuality. Yes, as a primarily teenage cast living in a conformist dictatorship, each of them are bound to, at some point, question who they really are, what they want in life, and how they live their lives. Every character, either before or during the events of the show, goes through this journey that ends up defining them and their role. It's this that turns Ryuko from the hotheaded rebel to someone who craves a sense of identity,  Mako from a comic relief to an emotional anchor, Senketsu, who I remind you is a blood-sucking sailor uniform, to one of the most lovable characters of the show and Satsuki goes from a prideful ice queen to spoiler spoiler and more spoilers. Even outside of the main cast we have memorable characters like the muscle bound, yet surprisingly moe, Ira Gamagoori, the theatrical and attention-grabbing Aikurou Mikisugi, and then there's Nui Harime. Oh Nui, you cutesy, detestable, little troll you. Her words are like nails on a chalkboard, her presence is like a shadow looming over a playground, and by the end of the series you will want her to die a slow painful death. My god, did I enjoy having her around. Yes, all that I just said is true, but she just has such charm to her, you can't help but love to hate her, maybe even just love her period for just how much deadly fun she is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's just a certain charm that comes with all of these crazy, strange, nonsensical, and wholly loveable characters coming together to create one giant family of awesome, while simultaneously saving the world. The characters of Kill la Kill, don't have much depth, except for perhaps Ryuko and Satsuki, but they don't necessarily need it. They're familiar, yet distinctive, likeable, and unforgettable, and sometimes that's all a show needs to have a great cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (10/10) (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou know, if you told me after I watched the first episode of Kill la Kill that it would end up being one of my favorite shows, I would have to think that you knew next to nothing about what I enjoy in anime.  But lo and behold, I am writing an extremely positive review of the show and declaring it one of my new favorites. There's been a little joke ever since Kill la Kill was announced, even before it aired, that Kill la Kill was \u201csaving anime\u201d made mostly by people who wanted to mock the idea of over-hyping shows, and yet ironically only ended up hyping it even more. Do I agree with this idea, no. Anime doesn't need saving, despite my jesting in the opening paragraph, and hype is something that shouldn't be considered when judging any type of work because what's important is what's right in front of you. So what do you get from Kill la Kill? One of the most fun anime i've seen in a while that manages to be well-written and full of heart. I can't, with good conscience, give it a perfect score, but that does not stop me from adoring it as much as I do. It's a show that may not be for everyone, but I highly recommend checking it out nonetheless. Anyways that's all for now. Til next time.",

            "content": "Don't lose your WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY\r\nOkay, with that out of the way.\r\nIn your MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIND\r\nSorry.\r\nI have a LOT of admiration for this show. Given, I see some issues with it, but I also see some great aspects as well. Please, if I begin gushing, feel free to slap me.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story's alright. It's Gurren Lagann with clothes. Start of with one villain, who just wants to oppress. Overcome villain. Find new villain who wants to completely enslave humanity. Explosions ensue. The premise is pretty goofy, but hey, sometimes it's nice to appreciate the goofy. One issue I do have is the obsession with fanservice in this show. It'sstarts off well enough, a symbol of putting aside personal shame for the sake of achieving goals, but after about episode 3 or 4, it just seems to be fanservice for fanservice's sake.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art here is all over the place. Sometimes, we get over the top fight scenes, with swords clashing hundreds of times a second, explosions everywhere, and people falling from the sky. Other times, we get a still character moving across a still background. It's quite jarring actually, but if you can get past it, this show can be eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice acting, both sub and dub, are done quite well. I personally prefer sub, as Satsuki just sounds all the more intimidating, but preferences. The music is a LOAD of fun, from fitting character themes, to Blumenkranz, to Before My Body is Dry.\\n\\n\r\nWE HAVE TO BEEEEEEEEEEEE AS OOOOOOOOOOONE\\n\r\n*slap*\\n\\n\r\nThank you. All in all, this show's just fun to listen to, and I can advise looking up the soundtrack. You'll have fun. I promise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters MAKE this show. Well, and one other aspect, but I'll cover that in the next section. Ryuko and Satsuki are brilliant, and Satsuki even graces my favorite characters list. Ryuko is strong-willed, hot-headed, and rather foolish. However, she sticks to her guns, if not her morals. She never gives up throughout the series, and because of her stubbornness, she ends up growing quite a bit as a character. She's not perfect by any means, but she's fun. Satsuki however... The woman is  intimidating, domineering, stoic, inspirational, COMPLETELY goal-oriented, and forever a joy on the screen. Plus, girl got good eyebrow game.\\n\r\nThe other characters are okay. Not bad, but maybe not amazing. Mako was quite funny at times. Ragyou was a character you just LOVED to hate. The Elite Four pinged off of each other well. Senketsu was actually one of my least favorite characters. He's not BAD, but he never stood out to me too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIt's not a ten because of the aforementioned fanservice. However, I'd like to posit that Kill la Kill is a  BRILLIANT satire. It starts off simply making fun of the magical girl genre. Eh. Then, it makes fun of the anime high school setting (get it? because the school LITERALLY determines the living conditions of these people : high school is life) But that's not the true  brilliance. Over the top explanations of attacks, to the point where I sometimes felt that the characters were staring at the camera, those cheeky jerks. Mikisugi is a parody of Sosuke Aizen (he pulls off his glasses, and his personality and hair drastically change). Ragyou is a parody/homage to Gendo (have you seen her office). Isshin Matoi is a parody of dead anime fathers (seriously, how he treated her was terrible. Why would she fight to avenge him? Because the plot demands it, Kasigah!) And then there's the compilation episode. My gosh. This... this is the greatest moment in anime history. I won't spoil it too much, but this is an episode that you must watch. I believe it's episode 18 or so, though I don't remember. Seriously, stop reading this. Go watch the compilation episode and come back. I'll wait.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis show is a barrel of fun. If you can't stand fanservice, I can't recommend it, but if you think you can handle it, please watch this show. It's not the \"Savior of Anime\" that so many believed, but boy does it have high points.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is one of those shows that my friends adore the shit out of that I'm incapable of getting on with. How could this be, though? I'm a huge fan of Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill was made by the same blokes who created the former and for what it's worth, the show really does retain the same sort of fun atmosphere Gurren Lagann had. Unfortunately, that sort of fun atmosphere isn't enough to actually make me like this show. Whereas Gurren Lagann had me cheering on all the senseless stupidity that was going on, Kill la Kill didn't really have mecheering on much of anything. In fact, Kill la Kill got pretty grating after a short while and it's basically what soured my overall impressions of Trigger as a studio and given their track record as of late, I don't think I'll ever get on with them.\\n\\n\r\nAll of my gripes with Kill la Kill boil down to three simple problems:\\n\\n\r\n1) It's functionally identical to Gurren Lagann\\n\\n\r\nThis was basically what turned me off of Kill la Kill for the most part. I understand that the bulk of the staff working on Kill la Kill were the ones that made Gurren Lagann, but that's no excuse to rehash the same type of over-the-top stupidity from one show into another. Really, was it such a monumental effort on the part of the production studio to come up with something original? Whenever I watch an episode of Kill la Kill, I can't help but feel like I'm wasting my time watching this show because Gurren Lagann does exactly what Kill la Kill does and does it significantly better. Why is this? Well for starters, it's not shoving shitty self-parody down my throat half the time. That actually brings me to the next gripe:\\n\\n\r\n2) The self-aware humour was EXTREMELY grating\\n\\n\r\nI don't know about you, but I'm beginning to despise self-aware shows mostly because of the fact that it seems like any show that came out within the last few years basically point out all of their problems without doing anything funny with what they bring up. In other words, all they're doing is saying \"Hey, look at this thing we did! It's so stupid, right? Laugh, damn you!\" Whenever Kill la Kill makes a self-aware joke, it takes me out of my bubble and reminds me that what I'm watching is stupid and I could be watching something better. You see, the biggest reason as to why I enjoy shows like Code Geass and Gurren Lagann boil down to the fact that everything is so hyperbolic and ridiculously cool to the point where I'm too wrapped up in my own enjoyment of the programme to realise what I'm watching is stupid. Whenever Kill la Kill comes close to making me forget that what I'm watching is stupid, there has to be a goddamn self-aware joke thrown in because they did this stupid thing and they want me to know that they're aware they did this stupid thing and that I should laugh because it's so stupid. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't make me laugh because it tells me that Trigger is doing is stupid, they KNOW what they're doing is stupid, but they're still doing it anyway. This isn't to say that self-aware humour is inherently bad, because it's something that's actually pretty funny if the guys making the show know how to make a self-aware joke funny. If you want a good idea of something that does the whole self-aware shtick properly, just watch an episode of Ouran HSHC, Dave the Barbarian, Sheep in the Big City, Ed Edd n Eddy, Chowder, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, or one of the classic Looney Tunes shorts (like Duck Amuck). Studios like Trigger irritate the shit out of me because they're ruining self-aware comedy just because they're too lazy to actually come up with a funny joke. Well, I guess the self-aware humour isn't as big a thorn in my side as all the fan service.\\n\\n\r\n3) The fan service got downright nauseating for me\\n\\n\r\nSay what you will about Gurren Lagann and how they handled Yoko, but the fan service in Gurren Lagann was tame enough to the point where I could look past it and focus more on the story at hand. Unfortunately, the story at hand in Kill la Kill is all about the fan service. Before you say anything, Kill la Kill is NOT a parody of fan service and if it actually was a parody, it's even worse than it was before. The lacklustre comedy and the fact that it's a cheap imitation of Gurren Lagann make it mediocre on its own. If this were actually meant to be a parody or a satire of fan service in anime, that brings this show down even more. \\n\\n\r\nThis show does nothing to subvert expectations and instead opts to use fan service like Ikkitousen or Queen's Blade does. THANKFULLY, Kill la Kill is nowhere near as obscene as the former two but it does get rather close at times. I get it, Ryuko and Satsuki are hot. There is NO need to shove their half-naked bodies and damn-near exposed breasts down my throat for 75% of every episode. As much as I like my daily dose of animated girls exposing their skin, there's a limit to how much I can enjoy before it stops being enticing and ends up becoming repulsive.\\n\\n\r\nNow with all of that in mind, there is one question that has must be answered: did Kill la Kill truly save anime? No, it's more of the same pandering shlock that's been polluting anime at large for the last several years in a different coat of paint. You know, Trigger could've gone ahead and created something that was actually worthwhile like the anime equivalent of a show like Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, or Adventure Time: you know, shows that appeal to all ages and are fun to watch whilst also tackling darker and deeper themes. Unfortunately, they decided to rehash the same shit that they did before (whilst working under a different studio) and judging by their current offerings now like Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer, it's obvious that pathetic comedies are the only thing they're capable of making. Say what you will about Gainax, but at least they've got more variety to their roster.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)",

            "content": "Kill La Kill: it made my head hurt, but not because it's terrible, rather because it's one heck of a ride. It likes to be over the top and it will show. I decided to watch it because there was a big hype around it and saying goes that it was a very interesting show. So I watched it, thus my review:\r\nSTORY:\r\nI'd split it in two parts: the plot which you can kind of tell from the premise and the second part which...is not so foreseeable.\r\nThe first part consists of Ryuuko searching for her father's murderer and the secrets around it. For that, she needsto get to Satsuki and that also means defeating other people in Ryuuko's way. The plot shows progress as she has to fight the Four Devas in hope she can get her hands on Satsuki. And at the end, she does get what she wanted but not in the way she imagined it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd suddenly, second half of the plot begins and we come from mere revenge and unraveling her father's death to saving the world. The second half feels a bit detached from the initial premise and at first I was really startled by it but I thought I'd go along and see where the plot takes me. 2nd half makes some sense but it's undermined by some issues.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say that the first half is far better than the second half. Not only because of the plot but for other reasons which come reviewing the other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art style is really something. You will quickly realize how over the top Kill La Kill really is just by the art style alone. Sometimes like an 90's anime, sometimes very modern but it never feels chaotic or stressful for the eyes. It's very pleasant and I'm happy to say that it's indeed as unique and well executed as I've heard from the hype surrounding Kill La Kill.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'll talk about the fanservice.\\n\r\nIf you dislike fanservice quickly, this show will be hard for you. It is very heavy on it. It also has plot reasons but nevertheless it comes out as fanservice most of the time. Ryuuko's finishing attack tears the clothes of her opponents completely. The transformations (and the result of them) are also fanservice and other things too, but the most comes from these two things.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I was forgetting that the girls fight in fanservice-y outfits but at times, it was unaviodable because of the camera angles and other things. For what it is, the fanservice does look good and it shows how flexible the art direction of the show can be. Sometimes however, it distracted me and that isn't that beneficial.\\n\\n\r\nThat some aspects of the show are a double-edged sword is pretty common. And the fan service is one point of it. But otherwise, the style is great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI like the songs during action scenes, they are good. A small variation most of the time but it was good. Opening and Ending Songs are nothing special to me, I can't comment that much about it. Not my type of music, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are mostly good, I just get annoyed by Nonon and Nui at times. Nonon just a few times but Nui's voice is something I don't like to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nRyuuko is kind of a typical character, just in female. However, I like her gutsy character and that she doesn't flinch at the slightest sight of danger. Strong-willed characters like her are really likable in my opinion. Concerning development a bit lacking but nevertheless a good character.\\n\\n\r\nMako and her family...oh boy, that's a tough bunch of characters to write about. It's hit-or-miss. And it that case, they missed me after a 1/4 of the series. The antics of them aren't bad but they become stale quickly. Especially Ryuuko's \"friend\" or depending on how you see it, tag-along Mako.\\n\\n\r\nShe isn't only a comic relief but also a Deus Ex Machina at times. Considering that these happen because of her climax- and atmosphere-breaking comical behavior, she became a really annoying character in my eyes. Her character does progress a bit but her comical relief parts just come at such bad times that it spoilt my mood several times during action scenes. And this happens often enough.\\n\\n\r\nHer personality is missing me too. She's played as an airhead, often missing the point or serious atmosphere around her and it can be funny, but it can also be annoying. For me, it tended toward the latter. The rest of the family is pretty one-note.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Ryuuko's homeroom teacher who will become relevant for the plot but I found him annoying after a few episodes because his jokes become stale too. Also hit-and-miss.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki is the antagonist and as she's the Student Council President, different but kinda the same like Ryuuko: she's also strong-willed, has an iron fist when it comes to showing her resolve, has a cold exterior and so on: you can see why Ryuuko wants to fight her so badly.\\n\r\nBut inside, she's also caring for her other companions in the Student Council, you'll see that coming as the plot progresses. I liked her the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe Four Devas (Satsuki's companions in the Student Council) also have personalities. Sometimes they behave very one-note or stereotypical but the over-the-topness of the series makes them still shine. The conversations among themselves were also interesting in my opinion but they were sparse at times.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the characters you will most often see and to avoid spoilers, I cannot reveal more characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThe plot of Kill La Kill has some twists here and there. One was foreshadowed and while it was predictable to me, I really liked it as the plot progress was pushing me to disbelieve in a certain possible plot twist. However, the plot twists so often that it ties itself a knot and a few plotholes and missing background on certain characters, especially in the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a sensible amount of plot twists I can stomach. And then there is the amount that leaves you in disbelief. Not because a twist is awesome, more because it makes you think: \"WHAT?! WHY?!\". Unfortunately, Kill La Kill goes for the latter. They weren't needed in that amount and the plot would be more enjoyable if it wouldn't want to twist itself so much.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the fanservice is relevant to the plot. And there I'm not sure whether I should take seriously what Kill La Kill is going for or not. Even more with the comedic moments (like Mako's mood-breaking antics). Some are well-placed, others not and it can confuse people that the show cannot focus entirely on what it wants to be or where it wants to go.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the second half also dampened my enjoyment with unnessecary fanservice where I thought multiple times: \"That's some bad touch there\". The first half was tamer with it and I liked it, even if fanservice was a bit plenty at times.\\n\\n\r\nBut the art style, over-the-top antics and general mood combined with the action scenes are really refreshing. At times, it can make you forget the grief you have with annoying characters or gratitious fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nKill La Kill isn't bad. It does some things right and other things not. You can feel that the series is style over substance and it shows. The style is great, the substance mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko (and her cloth Senketsu that I like but isn't that outstanding) and Satsuki are totally fine by me. The Four Devas also, Nonon a little less but still fine.\\n\\n\r\nFor Mako and her family, Ryuuko's homeroom teacher and many other characters you'll encounter, especially on the evil side...hit-or-miss. For me, they were a miss.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Mako and her family enough, you can add +1 to the overall score. If you like Mr. Homeroom Teacher, +0.5.\\n\\n\r\nEven with such a low rating on enjoyment, it's definitely worth a watch since Kill La Kill is indeed a heck of a ride and experience gained.",

This is the anime where hype is the definition of anime itself, where fanservice creates action and where music circulates the blood (pun alert) in your body into a powered-up mechanism of sprawling adrenaline. \r\nBeing created by the makers of the highly acclaimed and recognized Gurren Lagann and FLCL, Kill la Kill is brought by the newly formed Studio Trigger. Kill la Kill tells the tale of Ryuuko Matoi, a vagrant school girl wayfaring from location to location who's raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to search for clues behind the mysterious truth of her father\u2019s death. Wielding a scissor-sword, Matoi arrives toHonnouji Academi to look for her father\u2019s assassinator. However, this is where the journey truly begins as standing in her way is the Student Council President, also known as Kiryin Satsuki as well as her personal four divas, or more commonly referred to as the Elite Four of the academy. Along the journey, Ryuuko finds beneath her house, Senketsu, a Kamui which is an outfit in which the host is provided with near god-like abilities in exchange for their blood. This power gives her the opportunity to overcome her enemies, hindrances in her journey for finding the answers she wants. \\n\\n\r\nWhen watching Kill la Kill, it is vital that the audience understands the fact that the laws of physics, common sense and logic does not apply in this show. This show de facto requires you to turn off your thinking caps and your brain itself, because if you decide to decipher and analyze this show intrinsically, you will find countless amounts of flaws and problems. Hell, you can even say that Kill la Kill has its own laws of physics and definition of common sense. Despite having a predictable plot at the start, the execution is what makes Kill la Kill stand out alongside Gurren Lagann.  Every episode contributes to the overall plot and there is little to no filler, even so if there is filler, it would not really be considered filler as in Kill la Kill, they develop intricate relationships between our characters and grow bonds of brotherhood, kinship, fraternity and solidarity. Exaggeration is brought out to the utmost extremes and this is where the hyped-up and epic action derive from. \\n\\n\r\nIn the early stages, Kill la Kill\u2019s visuals may seem a tad deterring and lacking from the average modern eye-candy anime viewer. It utilizes a range of colours and a firmly toned set of strong outlines to refurnish the fact that logic does not exist within the anime, thus brings out an art style similar to the chaotic. Studio Trigger manages to take short turns and exploit the animation aspect to the degree where some scenes are extended with single frames longer than usual. Giant red text is presented here and there to furthermore add to the epic explosive action and over-the-top, unconstitutional and unorthodox setting and ambiance of the show itself. \\n\\n\r\nHaving the main characters being females, Matoi is depicted as the archetype of fortitude, the paradigm of grandness and the epitome of any strong women. Not only does she stand for herself, but after enduring suffering, adversity and defeat for countless amounts of times, the word \u2018giving up\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to be in her dictionary. You can even say that Studio Trigger is trying to promote equality right now and right here if you look deeply, rather than shallowly. Members of the main cast are diverse and each have their own unique backstories told, for the Elite Four, throughout the first cour of the series, the tale of how they met Satsuki is told as well as why they deeply respect and honour Satsuki as the President. Comedy is also embedded into the characters, such as Mako, arguably the comic relief as well as utilizing comedy within the Elite Four to ultimately make them likable. Satsuki, playing the role of the villain is portrayed as the paradigm of badassness and being fierce as she is, she is the reason for the continued development and bringing of Matoi\u2019s perseverance and indomitability of the human spirit. With underlying and hidden ulterior motives, Satsuki utilizes Matoi to the full extent and eventually develops Matoi as a character. There is also a depiction of the theme of family within Kill la Kill and is heavily emphasized on. Spending time with Mako and her family ultimately develops Matoi as a person as well and allows her to experience what she does not have, a family. Likewise, Mako besides being a comedy aspect in the show is also another reason for Matoi\u2019s growth. As time passes, their time spent together acts as ingredients of amalgamation into developing Matoi\u2019s personality as she shows care towards the family and even fights for their sake, especially during the episode where they were captivated by material interests and money. Another prime character would be Senketsu, her sailor uniform. He acts as voice of conscience and reason whenever Matoi goes overboard or is emotionally hurt, he provides advice when he can. \\n\\n\r\nThe music? ITS EPIC.ITS GOOD. AND ITS AMAZING. This might even be an understatement at this point. The music is abundant and has a diverse range of tracks used throughout the 24 episodes. Composed by Hiroyuki Sawano who also composed music for well-recognized shows including Attack on Titan, Guilty Crown and Blue Exorcist, the soundtrack is outstanding and simply makes the show even grand than it already is. Sawano produces music of excellence that is addictive and energetic in order to get the audiences\u2019 body moving and blood pumping. Kill la Kill also used euphonious, emotional and sympathetic music such as \u2018I Want To Know\u2019 during emotion provoking scenes. Joyous scenes also utilize music such as \u2018Light Your Heart Up\u2019 at the most appropriate times. Now to the action scenes, one of the most memorable soundtracks used would of course include the popular \u2018Before My Body Is Dry\u2019 or more well known for its tagline \u201cDON\u2019T LOSE YOUR WAYYYY\u201d.  This track is used throughout the course of the 24 episodes predominantly during action scenes when Matoi does something especially badass and where \u2018epic\u2019 is the only word you can bring your mouth to say. Ironically enough, she loses her way invariably but this is what develops her as a character. This track is arguably used a bit too repetitively some say, but I personally opine that it\u2019s what makes action scenes have its own essence. Another action based track used would include \u2018Suck Your Blood\u2019 which fits especially well during adrenaline packed action scenes. In addition, \u2018Sanbika\u2019 sang by Aoi Eir, is another addictive and energetic track that would get you on the edge of your seat. Both openings, \u2018Sirius\u2019 by Aoi Eir and \u2018Ambiguous\u2019 by GARNIDELIA prepares you with eagerness and anticipation for what you are going to experience in the subsequent episode, it can be best described as a catalyst to amaze and make the episode shine even more. Both endings are also used decently as closures for the episodes more notably during the final 2 episodes as a calm remedy for the audience to recuperate from all the sheer action taken place. Other memorable tacks include Satuski\u2019s dictator-like badass theme as well as Nui Harime\u2019s theme.\\n\\n\r\nBy this time you would probably be wondering why \u2018Blumenkranz\u2019 isn\u2019t mentioned yet. Well, it deserves its own little paragraph you see. \u2018Blumenkranz\u2019 is used throughout the series as a villain theme and has been one of the best villain themes I have ever heard. It adds on to the entertainment value of the series and is definitely one of the most memorable tracks of KLK. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, every episode brings out anticipation pumping and circulating your \u2018blood\u2019 (pun alert) to its zenith. Kill la Kill definitely excels at the enjoyment aspect and every episode plays out to its pinnacle and despite the simple plot, the execution is brought out perfectly. The characters are likable and all have their own inherent worth and value while the animation despite being seemingly poor with a low budget, is utilized amazingly. The sheer epic-ness of the anime alone is enough of a reason to rewatch the show any day, any time and even anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are you doing? Go watch Kill la Kill now and get your body movin!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "This review contains some spoilers.\r\nI was hesitant to watch Kill la Kill because I thought that it would simply be about scantily clad girls fighting each other for 24 episodes. I wasn't entirely wrong, but it is a little bit deeper than that. It goes beyond what I perceived the limitations of the ecchi genre to be. While I wouldn't call it the \"savior of anime\" as many have dubbed it, Kill la Kill was an enjoyable series. It had something great going at first, but then fell short of what it could have been.  \r\nBefore I watched Kill la Kill I was toldthat the uniforms are actually not supposed to be for fanservice, but instead fill a greater role. This is what made me want to watch the show. I enjoy parodies. It is not only entertaining to point out what is wrong with the industry, but I feel it is also crucial to improving it. The issue with Kill la Kill's parodic style is that you lose track of where it is making commentary on other anime and where it is just another one of those generic shows. The revenge plot has been recycled over and over and KLK's usage of it begs the question of whether or not they meant it to point out the issue or if it was just conforming to that style of story. The highschool setting was the strongest portion of the parodic element. Too many anime are set in a highschool. Well maybe that is unfair. Too many anime portray a realistic highschool poorly. KLK's highschool setting works because it is obviously making fun of this trope. However the parodic element of the story I so enjoyed was brief. Once it gets into the main plot line, it just becomes repetitive. The story begins to drag its feet towards the middle, and then by the end it is no longer making fun of other anime, but instead becoming what it was parodying. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the outfits as a plot device, here are my thoughts. We are in a time where many girls and women feel frustrated. They are frustrated not only because they feel that women are still oppressed, but also because society tells them they must act and dress a certain way. Most of this anger is channelled into rants against men or how women are portrayed in media. Kill la Kill may seem like another show objectifying women and their bodies, but I believe that it is actually empowering to women. While to some degree it may be marketing their bodies, the over-the-top outfits also serve to make a point. The kamui can only reach its full potential when the user is able to block out all feelings of embarrassment and feel comfortable in their own skin. I think this is a powerful message to girls and women. This is not to say that everyone should go around cosplaying Ryuko Matoi, but instead that you should be able to dress however you want. Who cares what onlookers think? It's your body and you should dress how you feel comfortable. Beyond the clothing, the whole series is female dominated. The protagonist, the antagonists, and many of the supporting roles are all played by strong women. This is why I think that Kill la Kill turned the ecchi genre on its head. There are no weak willed damsels in distress who are barely covered by tight fitting clothing; instead there are confident and smart women who are comfortable with how they look.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are strangely reminiscent of DBZ. The costume transformations at first seem to poking fun at the whole \"you fool, this isn't even my final form\", or my favorite \"Up until this point I wasn't even trying.\" Like I said earlier, at first it seems like a clever parody, but then starts to use it over and over, becoming less intelligent each time.\\n\\n\r\n As for art, Trigger provides the fast paced animation that is expected in their productions. It's certainly fun to watch, but as you get further and further into the series, it becomes a little tiresome. The battles mainly consist of characters shouting at each other before clashing in an colorful display of explosions and blood spouts. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are by no means groundbreaking. Beyond the elements of female empowerment I mentioned earlier, they are all pretty standard. We've seen the protagonists that are hellbent on revenge, the villains who wish to destroy the world, and the characters that don't seem to care about much at all. By this I mean Mako and her family. While they are hilarious and serve as some great comic relief in tense dramatic moments, that's about all they do. But that's okay because they do a great job of it. My only complaint about Mako is that the relationship between her and Ryuko did not really develop but instead was established immediately. She plays a great foil for Ryuko, or in other words, her sidekick that is her polar opposite. As for the other characters, their ultimate roles were quite predictable. Somehow I knew that Satsuki and Ryuko would end up working together against the real antagonist. This has been done before, and will continue to be done. While I am not a huge fan of plot twists, I think they can still be done well and be integrated smoothly into a series. Thankfully Kill la Kill is one of these series.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the eye-catching art, Mako's monologues, and its brief moments of commentary on the anime industry, Kill la Kill is nothing outstanding. However these elements are enough to make it a solid series that is worth watching. To me the series dragged out in the end and probably could have been condensed, but that's the only real complaint as far as pacing. I wasn't expecting much out of Kill la Kill, but was pleasantly surprised by what I received.",

            "content": "Quit honestly, I really don't know where to start. I watched this show hoping to get my quick fix for a good action show and what I got was complete satisfaction and then even more than I could chew right afterwards. I honestly could just be overselling this a bit but this anime truly was something to behold and is truly what all anime should be like. \r\nIt was not only the action that stole my heart, it mostly all of the characters and their personalities and skills. I was truly blown away by how fantastic all of the characters in this show truly were.I couldn't even help but love the antagonists with all of my heart.If I had to pin point what won me over completely it would most definitely have to be the set of characters that they used in this amazing show. Although I do have to admit, if you're a stickler for logic then don't even bother with this show because you find a single shred (or thread for puns sake) of that in this show. But in my opinion that only makes it the show even better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely a great factor in this show as well. The animation is a bit more cartoonish than most anime but after seeing the fight scenes you definitely see why the animation was quite enjoyable. I think that it only improved the humor in the show as well, which is fantastic as well by the way. So, even though it's a bit more cartoonish than most anime out there, I think you'll grow to see that it fits in very well with show and only improves some of it's aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was great, I don't have quite as much to say about it but do not doubt that is some fantastic music that improves the drama and tension of most of the important scenes. I even have the whole soundtrack on my phone and it was totally worth it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment, I'm sure you can already tell that this is most definitely a very enjoyable anime just by the mood of this review. The action most definitely one of it's finer points though. It's so very over the top and amazingly animated that you can't help but get incredibly pumped by the music and the intense fight scenes. Not only is it incredibly intense but it also gives you quite a bit of enjoyable humor to put the show on a bit of lighter note after all of the intense action. Though it's a lot like Gurren Lagann where it always seems to end on a nice and happy note when it is called for which is also a great thing to have. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the greatest animes I've watched in quite a while so I found it very enjoyable. Although, I'll this again, I could just be overselling it a bit due to how excited this show made me just by watching it so I'll let you guys decide on how great it is. To be completely honest the only thing that bugged me a bit was that there is a slight bit of Yuri that I feel doesn't truly belong there but that honestly is just a personal preference of mine (I won't say anything more to avoid spoilers). I don't think that should bother anybody else though because you can totally see it coming once you get further in the show. ANYWAYS. Watch Kill La Kill, I'm confident you'll at least enjoy it a little if not love it as much as I do if you give a chance.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is the anime equivalent of being in the passenger seat of a high-speed joy ride during a blind date. It's fast, it's bombastic, it's lots of fun, a kickass radio station is blasting out the best tunes, you really don't trust your date's driving, their pupils are a bit too dilated for your tastes, they keep touching your knee, and you feel both exhilaration and uneasiness when you finally get home. Then, when you decide to go on another date, you find out that they got busted for owning cocaine paraphernalia and uploading hardcore amateur porn to Pirate Bay. Which would probablyexplain why they kept insisting that being naked in front of a camera is \"empowering\".\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you have a strong stomach for the more sexually exploitative aspects of Seinen, or at least your need for thrill hits harder than your tendencies for discomfort, you might have a good time with Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen this anime twice: once in Japanese, and once in English. I think I had a more positive experience with the anime the first time around, since I was more unfamiliar with my surroundings, and thus tended to ignore the questionable features that Trigger brings us. Since I knew what was going on the second time, it gave me more opportunity to pay attention to the art - and the obnoxious amounts of panty shots that hid under the veil of girl power.\\n\\n\r\nSure, it is a Seinen, and it's supposed to be \"ironic\" (or at least meaningful) fanservice. I don't really understand this trend of doing things ironically or satirically, especially when it gives the exact same vibes as any unironic fanservice. Like, if I crap myself ironically to make a statement about the value of underwear, I still have to go clean up afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nTo the actual review now.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is action packed and a lot happens in the 24 episodes it has. There's only about one filler episode, and even then it introduces aspects of the series that are important. It's extremely plot twisty, especially near the end of the show. For the plot itself, the idea is heavily intriguing, but half of it serves to justify the skimpy outfits. I mean, it's a good story. It's just dripping with misogyny disguised as feminist empowerment. Embracing the invasion of your personal space and privacy isn't worth praise. \\n\\n\r\nWhat drew me and made me watch the whole thing twice was truly the visual aesthetic of Kill la Kill. The animation of KLK shows distinctive detail to character designs and a lot of dynamic oomph. If any character looks like the clone of another, it's entirely intentional. Although the show is generally in a shounen style, Jojo lines and all, it often flexes between thick rigidity and bouncy playfulness. The colors are a spectrum, from gritty browns and olives to bright rainbows, and of course an emphasis on the color red. It's visually consistent in quality, largely due to letting episode four act as a visual bootleg (mostly as a gag). This bombastic approach to art is nothing else but appealing, and makes the more squicky scenes of the series palatable. There are moments when the animation is clearly lacking (such as an early sequence where Satsuki runs up a building), but overall it definitely works.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing but praise for this anime's OST - just as dramatic as the art, the music sets the mood perfectly for every situation. From the draconian crescendo of Satsuki Kiryuin's leitmotif, to the rebellious beat of Ryuko Matoi's theme, and to the ostentatious curl of Raygo's accompaniment, there's nothing out of touch or taste. If anything can pump you up for a good fight or slow you down for a touching scene, it's the OST for this anime. That said, there's rarely a silent moment in KLK - which isn't particularly good for things like flow.\\n\\n\r\nI do have qualms for the motivations behind designing the characters' personalities and motivations, but there are few characters which I actually dislike in terms of development, and I generally feel that Trigger did a good job making these characters lively and genuinely interesting. Even pieces of clothing will make you want to cry (and not because they're goofily designed). I still hold an attachment to Nonon Jakuzure, the little cupcake who sounds like a dying cat. They really make you hate the characters you're supposed to hate, which is both a good and a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime relies a lot on the idea that showing skin is empowering, or at least not a bad thing at all. But this is achieved through consent violation, almost a majority of the time. Senketsu literally forces himself on Ryuuko, an obvious injury to her personal space. This is seen as a good thing, and she can't get to full power without accepting both his presence and her nigh nudity (and constantly getting called an exhibitionist). Aikur\u014d Mikisugi's early presence in the series also gets excused, even though she's clearly uncomfortable with his behavior and unpleasant habit of randomly stripping. His status as a good guy makes this okay, though, or even supposedly humorous.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the villains also repeatedly violate the protagonists' consent, which is shown as wrong. Of course, the blood connection between one of these villains and the protagonists adds extra elements of wrongness, which adds to the evil of the antagonist in question. The violations in these cases are extremely sexual in nature, and although I've seen people claim this is intentionally creepy, I've seen just as many openly admit to finding this hot. It's bizarre that outright incestuous molestation is given the treatment of male gaze. The protagonists repeatedly lose their autonomy and right to say 'no', but don't worry guys - fanservice can be feminist!!! Because they can punch people! Let me remind you that most the protagonists are either underage or barely \"legal\".\\n\\n\r\nSome say that the literary themes of Kill la Kill went over my head, but I don't care. Fact is, the repeated normalization of consent violation, both overtly and covertly sexual, actually keeps people from watching this show. Like, it is a humongous issue that I only manage to stomach because I've been heavily desensitized. It's not just disgustingly misogynistic and hurtful, it's alienating. Despite the fact that I have a lot of good things to say about it, I can't enjoy it as much as I possibly could, due to the blatant sign on the door saying that I'm not welcome. Or at least, I and others are only welcome if we can tolerate a metaphorical hand creeping up our knees.\\n\\n\r\nMind you, I wouldn't show this much anger if people didn't insist that it is feminist, and just admitted they like looking at the body of an angry seventeen year old girl. Much like any other attempt at reclaiming a Seinen that I've seen people do.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, I did find Kill la Kill enjoyable. I can only give it a six, because of what I've mentioned above. If it weren't really gross, maybe it'd be a seven. Again, if you can stand all the crap this show has to offer, please watch it. If you can't, please don't, I care about you too much.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is one of those shows that just kind of popped up one day and took the Internet by storm. At first I thought it looked incredibly stupid and objectifying, but after seeing the millionth gif of Kiryuin Satsuki and her magnificent eyebrows, I finally decided to give the series a chance. KlK is a wild ride -- it's so high-energy that it's almost exhausting to watch. But if you love stylized, explosive, power-up anime in the spirit of Tenga Toppa Gurren Lagann, you'll probably love KlK as much as I did.\r\n[Story: 9/10]\r\nKill la Kill is pretty much a parody anime; it makesfun of common tropes in shounen and parallels the macho male coming-of-age story with a female one focusing on themes of shame, sexualization, and other problems faced by young girls and women. Also, a lot of the plot points are puns (such as the Naturals Election in one of the earlier episodes). With that in mind, I still think the storyline of this anime packed an impressive punch. It's definitely a turn-your-brain-off-and-go-with-the-flow kind of plot, and you won't find any detailed scientific explanations of the show's concepts, but the flow is well-paced, consistent, and ties up all its loose ends pretty nicely. It's also not the most mindblowingly original plot in the history of anime, but that's not what it sets out to do. The point is Matoi Ryuko's over-the-top coming-of-age story as she searches for her father's murderer and the shounen-style escalation of events that happens as a result of her actions, and KlK pulls that off pretty much flawlessly. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs far as animation quality goes, I'd say KlK is up there with the best of them. It's hardly realistic, but the animation is fluid, beautifully colored, and looks professional even in the comedically exaggerated scenes (like Mako's hallelujah moments). Character designs are all very distinct and recognizable without being completely stupid -- they do get pretty ridiculous at times, but one of KlK's general strengths is being ridiculous on purpose, recognizing that, and utilizing it for the good of the show (as opposed to going for something serious and then missing the mark completely, which I think is a very common mistake in anime). Since KlK is intentionally overdramatic, the animation often matches this. Basically, the artistic style and tone of the show complement one another perfectly; the style is believable because of the tone of the show and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nA big point of contention surrounding KlK is, of course, the fanservice. My first exposure to the show was through people defending the fanservice as an important feature of the story - a symbolic representation of the exposure and shame in their bodies young (cis) girls are taught to feel growing up, and how they are supposed to draw their power from their clothing and their blood (I think the metaphor there is obvious). At first I thought this was bullshit, but after actually watching the show, I ended up agreeing with that assessment. I can't really expound on this without giving major spoilers, but I think the overall message of the series can easily be read as  feminist (this coming from someone who is an active and outspoken non-male feminist, btw), and I think the way fanservice is handled in KlK is pretty much as intelligent as it's possible for fanservice to be handled. For one thing, male characters as well as female ones get sparkly naked transformation scenes, which is pretty great. For another, Satsuki and Ryuko are only really sexualized when they're wearing their kamui, which are central to the female coming-of-age metaphor. Other than that, they're treated like normal people; no random panty shots or boob-jiggling. There are multiple scenes towards the end of the series in which tall, glamorous Satsuki is completely naked and runs around fighting people, etc in this condition. We absolutely could have had some High School of the Dead-esque Matrix boobs here, or any other manner of sexualizing/humiliating/degrading views of her body. But instead this was animated completely normally, and one of the oher scenes I'm referring to is actually animated a bit over-the-top and played for laughs rather than sexual appeal. So while I would love to eventually see a show that just doesn't do fanservice at all, I think the fanservice in KlK is presented primarily as part of the show's message rather than as a tasteless grab for male viewers, and I would encourage people to give it a try even if they hate fanservice. (I despise fanservice and still love KlK. So.)\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawano was an experienced composer long before KlK came around; more recently he's known for composing the Shingeki no Kyojin soundtrack, which I thought was amazing. Well, with KlK, he's done it again. This soundtrack combines traditional orchestral sounds with electronic twists here and there, and it's full of energy and vitality that is absolutely perfect for KlK.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs are also good. They're all in a pretty typical J-rock style, but I liked the voices of all the singers. The songs were catchy, energetic, and overall fitting. Honestly, the only reason I ever skipped through them was because I was too eager to get to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting was great - don't get me wrong, it was hilariously over-the-top like everything else (be prepared for a lot of shounen-style yelling), but each character had a unique voice that fit their appearance and general personality perfectly.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of KlK, like most other aspects of the series, are all well-developed and distinct from one another. Some series have a problem where characters appear to have a certain personality, but as soon as that personality is inconvenient or gets in the way of a plot point, it's changed to something more cooperative or conducive to the results the writers want. KlK doesn't have that problem. Every character has their characteristics, beliefs, and ideals and stands by them firmly. Sometimes these ideals change over the course of the story, but never in such a way that seems sudden or illogical; what the characters say and do always makes sense, and right away you get a clear sense of who each person is. On the one hand I would've liked to see a little more personality development of some of the more major side characters, but KlK is more plot-driven than character-driven; trying to do in-depth character analysis on everyone would've put a huge damper on the show's characteristic energy.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nBeing more a fan of low-key anime like Haibane Renmei, I was overwhelmed and taken aback by the first episode. But it hooked my attention, and I kept watching, and now it's easily one of my favorite anime of all time. The plot just surges forward and keeps your attention; there's also a great balance of humor and drama mixed in. This is a show that knows how and when to be funny but can still keep your interest and emotional investment when it wants to get a little more serious.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nIf you love the stylized, power-charged coming-of-age genre and you want more, definitely watch this show. If you're used to more quiet, introspective anime and you hate over-the-top action, Kill la Kill might not be for you - but I recommend trying it anyway. If you've never seen an anime before and want to get a taste of all of its extremities packed into one roller coaster ride, of a show, try this one. The art, characters, story, music, everything fits together perfectly. I can absolutely acknowledge that some people just won't enjoy it due to its wacky, high-energy nature, but personally, I think KlK is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I don't have anything against \"popular\" anime in theory considering I have freaking Cowboy Bebop on my favorites list, but most of the present-day ones haven't been clicking with me and the ones I used to like haven't held up over time. No, I'm not referring to elitist bait that's a hit with the blogger crowd like Tatami Galaxy and Gankutsuou, but stuff that the merchandise wizards and the general MAL populace can sing to high heavens and market considerably at the next anime con like the only three anime people remember from Shaft these days (four if you arguably count Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei). Betweenmy generally pessimistic views on anime trends and the fact that most shows are a product of cashing in on them, before Kill la Kill came around, the last time I can honestly say I enjoyed an anime loved by the mainstream that still holds up by today's standards was Spirited Away in 2002 and arguably Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu in 2003.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even then, I wouldn't go so far as to say I worship Kill la Kill. I guess it takes a dedicated fan to plunk down over two hundred \"George Washingtons\" for the entire series on blu-ray, but there's no way in hell I'm doing anything else like buying a stuffed Mako plushie or adding to the hundreds of discussions regarding whether the show is a series about female empowerment (it's not). I do think there's some credibility regarding its take on dictatorships and fascism and all those other evil governments that we continue to complain about despite the fact that they're not really doing anything new when you get right down to it, but f*ck me if I'm touching that subject with a ten-foot pole. Because when you get down to it, the main reason I like Kill la Kill is because it's fun. More importantly, it's one of the best anime satires I've seen since...well Guilty Crown really, and isn't that just sad?\\n\\n\r\nHere's how most anime satires seem to work: do a cliche with one new twist added into the mix and then proceed to have a discussion regarding why said twist exists in the most dry manner possible, insult another anime whilst doing the exact same thing as said anime, or just insert a talking hedgehog into the mix and hope in vain that the mere novelty will get a laugh out of you. In other words, the kind of satire that makes me lose all faith in humanity. Kill la Kill, by contrast, practically dominates the competition to an illegal degree by managing to parody school settings, shonen action, magical girls, Go Nagai fanservice, and conspiracy thrillers solely through usage of \"the rule of crazy\" AND weave in an actual engaging hook amongst all the craziness regarding a girl's quest for revenge and the truth regarding the cause of said revenge without a single pause to breathe and being completely comfortable within its own zone. So even if you don't know what it's satirizing, you can still follow the story pretty damn well without getting taken out of the experience by some obnoxious fourth-wall gag.\\n\\n\r\nThe basic gist of the plot is that after her father is killed by an unknown assailant, delinquent high-schooler Ryuko Matoi follows the clues left behind to Honnouji Academy, a faux Nazi-like school run by student council president and master swordswoman Satsuki Kiryuin. Suspecting said president of being the killer, Ryuko attacks her only to be beaten soundly due to the academy employing student bodyguards with the ability to use life fibers, synthetic clothing that augments a person's capability to the nth-degree. In the wake of her defeat, Ryuko finds a mysterious talking school uniform that gives her the power to stand up to those life fibers in exchange for making her fight whilst looking like a BDSM club member. Utilizing said power, she works towards discovering the truth behind the school whilst conquering the challenges laid out to her by the student council and dealing with the wacky antics of her foster family.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the show aired, I remember reading an interview stating that the team's plans for it was to make every episode seem like the penultimate one. And boy does it show, because even when it slows down in order to clarify things, Kill la Kill refuses to let down on the energy. It keeps things exciting in theory, but it also means that if the writing isn't up to snuff, it can become kind of wearisome. And there were times when it definitely had that problem, particularly in the final stretch where cards were overplayed a bit too much and things basically boiled down to DBZ-levels of \"I am more powerful. No, I am more powerful!\", which I guess is why the show has been getting a bit of backlash since it ended along with the \"too much fanservice\" complaint, the \"style over substance\" complaint, and the \"doesn't hold a candle to Gurren Lagann\" complaint. But it led to an epicly suitable finale along with a pretty great epilogue that rounded things off in an exciting way whilst bringing in a fresh angle to avoid feeling drawn out so I could forgive that. \\n\\n\r\n- Although that epilogue was an OVA we wouldn't see in a few months, so the show can't really depend on that to save itself for the same reason you can't use the \"it'll be fixed in the Blu-rays\" excuse some people have given for Sailor Moon Crystal. Either make it work in prime time or prepare to face the consequences.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since I brought up that Lagann comparison complaint, I've been getting some questions regarding why that show isn't on my favorites lists whilst Kill la Kill is. Honestly, I don't get why. Whilst they share similar plot points and aesthetics, they're really nothing alike story-wise. Lagann is an underdog story that tributes the super robot genre with a lot of energy and basically follows a classic formula. Kill la Kill, by contrast, doesn't really give a fuck about the rules even when it seems like it does, with the story mostly being an excuse for all sorts of creative chops that can only be judged solely on whether it made me laugh. And you know what? Laugh I did. Despite its problems at times from the incredibly obvious budget limitations to the repetitive rivalries, it was generally funny and the surprisingly awesome English dub added to that greatly. Whoever voiced Ryuko nailed down her \"straight girl in a crazy world\" role perfectly to the point that it felt like she was an American who didn't understand the rules of anime, and all I can say to that is \"Sister!\"\\n\\n\r\nActually, when you get down to it, that's probably why Kill la Kill clicks with me so much. I like anime, obviously. I wouldn't write about the medium so much if I hated it. But it's pretty damn obvious that I'm kind out of place in anime fandom both in regards to my opinions and my writing in general to the point that I might as well be a stranger. Nevertheless, I like associating with it and have my buddies that are deep within the community, and whilst I'll never be the savior that said fandom wants or needs, Kill la Kill allows me to live in the fantasy of being said savior through Ryuko being a female parody of my mindset and the rest of the characters being a parody of anime fandom in general. Pity I don't have a best friend as cool as Mako, but if it means not eating her family's food, I think I'll live. Sort of. *Sob* I really do want a friend like her.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if it didn't click with me to the degree it had, I'd have thought the backlash was silly the same way I thought the backlash against Attack on Titan and Terror in Resonance was silly (Your Lie In April's backlash though, I could give two shits about, especially since it's in the top 15 on MAL as of this writing, and the top 10 if you ignore the fact that half of what's up there is Gintama). Okay fine, the \"savior of anime\" memes were annoying as hell, but you cannot deny that they took chances that paid off in ways that were progressive in a forward manner - regardless of the quality of said progression - in a medium that's built on being stagnant when it's not setting trends back by fifty years. Plus, whilst Kill la Kill's story does demand a satisfactory degree of seriousness (I wouldn't like the show if it didn't), the main reason you're supposed to watch the show is to laugh and have fun the same way Jojo was created mainly to laugh and have fun with it, and whilst you're allowed to treat it the same way as Titan, I'm going to shake my head at you if you do.\\n\\n\r\nDoes Kill la Kill have problems even by those standards? Sure. Do I think it's the savior of anime? Didn't even know it needed saving, but no. Is it as good as Gurren Lagann? Not a fair comparison. Is it my favorite anime of 2013? I think I prefer Flamenco on the whole - and by the way, Lagann shares a lot more comparisons with Flamenco than Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nIs it a good stand-alone anime? Yes. Why? It's fun. It's funny. The characters are likable. The visuals are mostly interesting even when it's on the cheap side. The music is...well the music is crap, but it fits well what's going on. The story, whilst not the deepest thing ever, was engaging and lent itself well to the many different hats that this show wears from tributing many different anime genres to standing on its own as a functional product. I don't regret the Aniplex prices I paid for this - especially with the kickass dub and other extras I got as a result - and I'll gladly do so again if I had the chance to take my decision back whilst secretly being thankful that that awful company never licensed anything else I enjoy.",

            "content": "I'll start this review out by acknowledging that my opinion is a very unpopular one. This anime has quite the following, and it's been described as the \"rebirth of classic anime,\" or something like that.\r\nPersonally, I found almost no enjoyment in this anime. The battles are drawn-out and boring. The characters are underdeveloped, stereotypical, and frankly, incredibly annoying. Satsuki is the only character that I could actually tolerate.\r\nThe OP is all right, I guess, but nothing special. The background music is more interesting than the battles could ever hope to be, but it ends up just being distracting.\r\nThe plot is bizarre, and makes very littlesense. Any quality that it may have had was thrown away and replaced by disgusting amounts of fanservice. People have argued that it was a \"critique\" of fanservice, and mocked it, but the \"It's making fun of the genre!\" argument can only go so far. Plain and simple: the fanservice was excessive, derogatory, and unnecessary.\\n\r\nIf you're not grossed out already, get this: a character is incestuously molested for /absolutely no reason/.\\n\\n\r\nIn my experience, fanservice has been used as a replacement for good writing quite a bit. This anime is a prime example.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the characters. The main character, Ryuko, is irritating and has unclear motives. The sidekick/comedic relief character, Mako, is annoying to the point of physical pain. I would love Satsuki if she were in any other anime, but KLK treats her character incredibly poorly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but everything else is so dreadful that I can hardly appreciate it. Please do not waste your time with this anime. I like Studio Trigger (Gurren Lagann, Little Witch Academia, and even Inferno Cop were infinitely better than this trash heap), but I cannot find it within myself to feel anything but intense hatred toward Kill la Kill.",

            "content": "Often, as I watch anime I tend to lose sight of why I'm watching it in the first place. Is it for the intellectually stimulating story lines? The deep symbolism and metaphorical allusions? The way it probes into universal truths about humanity and society?\r\nOr do I watch anime for the entertainment value? The aesthetic quirks that make anime, anime? The amount of fun and excitement to be had, with a group of larger-than-life characters?\r\nThere are many shows out there that are very enjoyable in a cerebral way. Revolutionary Girl Utena, Neon Genesis Evangelion, etc. The list goes on. Those series require the viewer to think,and are created with many questions purposely left unanswered. There are also shows so mindless that the only real way to get enjoyment out of them is to completely turn off one's brain while watching, such as the Symphogear series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, there's Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to try and argue that Kill la Kill is exceptionally intelligent, but nor will I dismiss it as simply brainless entertainment. Rather, this particular anime falls somewhere in between rationality and insanity, and that alone makes it worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I went into Kill la Kill with few expectations. Everything I had heard regarding the anime was either exceedingly, fanboyishly positive, or equally dismal and negative. I didn't expect to enjoy at all, but I ended up loving every moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Kill la Kill is quite simple to begin with, but later becomes so convoluted and large in scale that the initial premise is almost nowhere to be found. There is one major twist in towards the latter half of the series that throws away nearly everything that has been set up in the beginning, and this may come across as ridiculous to a lot of viewers. However, I personally found the \"all according to plan\" aspect of the twist to be set up quite well. Other than that, I also enjoyed the way the story was built up to be greater and greater in scale, from the actions of a few affecting a few to those same actions affecting the fate of the entire universe. It's so crazy that it's almost absurd, but Kill la Kill manages to hold on to a shred of believability no matter how insane, ridiculous, confusing, and over-the-top the plot gets.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters in Kill la Kill are all larger-than-life and are prone to drastic and sometimes downright insane actions, they all become quite endearing towards the end of the series, save for the major antagonists, who are equally twisted and detestable. If you're looking for a show where the villains are redeemed at the end, then [SPOILER WARNING] this is not your show. That being said, there are many instances of moral ambiguity in the other characters, and watching them grow throughout the course of 24 episodes was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art style of Kill la Kill match the story very well, with heart-pumping rock tracks during the battle scenes and a sketchy, cartoony animation that keeps up with the quick pace of the show. The budget of the animation seemed rocky at times, as evidenced by the not always consistent quality, but that didn't get in the way of my personal enjoyment of the show. The OST also contained several songs that are quite catchy and fit the mood of the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest redeeming factor of Kill la Kill was its atmosphere. It's fun and crazy, but retains a serious edge when it needs to. It takes itself seriously within the context of the show, but it also doesn't expect its audience to take everything seriously. Kill la Kill knows exactly what kind of show it is, and valiantly tries to hide it without seeming like its trying too hard. Yes, there's a ton of fanservice and more sexual innuendos than I can bother to count. Yes, the plot goes off in a million different directions, and yes, sometimes nothing really makes sense in the show. But despite all its flaws, Kill la Kill managed to be entertaining in its craziness and bold in its outright rejection of many tropes and standards, all the while touching on social/class issues with a brash sense of humor. Where Kill la Kill fails in respectability, it succeeds in making the entire show itself basically the moral of the story: That humans have the will and the ability to do whatever the hell they want if they are motivated enough.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is not the product of years of creative ingenuity, rather, it is spontaneous and doesn't hold back on anything. If you're looking for something to help you ponder existential issues, Kill la Kill is not the show you should be watching. Likewise, if you're looking to waste your time on dumb fanservice, Kill la Kill is also not the show you should be watching. But if you're looking for a solid piece of entertainment, if you're willing to overlook a few technical flaws for something fun and unforgettable, then you will definitely find it in Kill la Kill. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who just don't give a fuck.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill Review:\r\nWhen the creators of Gurren Lagann left Gainax to create their own studio, nobody really knew what to expect. After Kill la Kill's first preview however, the hype train began gaining momentum like a fat kid going down a lubed up slip and slide. So, does Studio Trigger deliver with their first big project? The answer put simply is: yes. \r\nStory - 7.6:\r\nKill la Kill tells the story of a girl named Ryuko who goes to Honnouji Academy in search of the person who killed her father. Here students are ranked by their uniform which is given a certain amount of stars.The more stars your uniform has, the more powerful you become, and the better off your family will live in the city. Ryuko comes across a powerful talking uniform that her father made named Senketsu, and thus our story begins. For more than the first half of the show, the plot isn't much more than Ryuko plowing through other students while wearing Senketsu in the most fanservicey way possible. It's basically just one fight after another with comedy sprinkled in too. While this is all unquestionably fun to watch, as far as the story goes, there wasn't much there. However, there is a point where the story starts to gain focus and things start to get more interesting beyond just the action scenes. Now, don't go into Kill la Kill thinking everything is going to make sense, and that the plot will move smoothly in a logical fashion. Because it doesn't. The members of Studio Trigger are famous for making shows that are pure mindless fun with a large scale plot that has nonsensical logic, and Kill la Kill is no different. If you can manage to turn your brain off while watching this show, you will have absolutely no problems with the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7.6:\\n\r\nKill la Kill has a mixed bag when it comes to the art. Starting with the negatives, overall, the animation can often feel like it lacked a sizeable budget. The shading is sub par, and the movements are also often not very fluid or realistic. There is also basically only one design for every single student that isn't significant in the story. HOWEVER, Studio Trigger should be greatly commended for how creatively used their budget. Because although the animation was subpar on the surface, they used many unique techniques in transitions, fight scenes, and even with the lighting that made you often forget any of it's flaws. The creative art style was brilliant and colorful, and the character designs were cool and varied. Also, the use of the giant red words was a very welcome addition to the show. In the end, no matter how bad the animation got, it never really interfered with my immersion in the show, but when the animation shined, it shined BRIGHT (just look at the censorship at nudist beach...) .\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8.6:\\n\r\nUnquestionably the strongest technical aspect of the show. Kill la Kill's OST was flat out ridiculous. Much like the show itself, the soundtrack had a sense of scale, using loud orchestras, choirs, and even multiple languages. Songs from Kill la Kill soundtrack are often instantly recognizable to the show even more-so than the also great openings and endings. The voice acting was also stellar with a very wide array of talent for a wide array of characters. Each voice actor fit each character perfectly, no matter how odd or obscure the role was. If I had to point out a few negatives it would just be that some songs were probably overused, and many of the non-epic songs were less than stellar. However, the sound aspect of this show deserves absolute praise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6.3:\\n\r\nEasily the weakest part of Kill la Kill was the show's characters. Not to say they weren't good, just that they could have and should have been much better. The cast of characters was large and varying in personalities which is a big plus. Also, each character has some sort of backstory or reasoning for their actions(no matter how obscure Trigger made these backstories). However, none of the characters felt anything more than one-dimensional. All were extremely predictable in their actions, and some were downright annoying after a while (Mako... you were funny at first... but not after the 15th time of using the same gimmick). One can argue that Kill la Kill needed a cast like this, that was just full of stereotypes who were predictable and don't develop. But I dare you to find a show with strong 3 dimensional characters who grew throughout the show that ended up making the show WORSE than if the characters were just cookie cutter stereotypes. All in all though, the characters were enjoyable for the most part, and that's what really matters, so a positive score is well deserved.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7.1:\\n\r\nThis is the section that should have a higher score... but for me it just didn't quite click as well as it could have. It was an absolute blast of a ride, but where Kill la Kill floundered was in its first half. Each episode up until the plot focuses is basically the same recipe over and over again. While it was always fun to watch the beautifully animated action scenes and the creative moves that would happen, it was in essence no more enjoyable than watching Ash Ketchum battle 10 different trainers throughout 13 episodes. The first 2 or 3 episodes were ridiculously entertaining because of the shear uniqueness of the show, but after repeated gimmicks and formulaic set ups of episodes, things got old. Of course, after the focus shift the show became Gurren Lagann-esque in terms of entertainment value, but that still cant excuse episodes 4-15 from their rather repetitive nature.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.44:\\n\r\nKill la Kill is without a doubt a wild ride that is a joy to watch. However, it is not the \"savior of anime\" that many people claim it to be (not that anime even needs saving). Inconsistent would be a great word to describe this show for just about every aspect I can think of. The characters range from great to meh, the story can range from \"WTF HOLY MOTHER WHAT JUST HAPPENED!?!?!\" to meh, and pretty much everything else can be described the same way. However, the highs easily outweigh the lows, and give Kill la Kill a very good score of a 7.44 out of 10 and a recommendation from me to watch it if you are indeed a fan of over the top action shows (and don't mind some.... interesting... fanservice).\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nMindless fun and action, a great debut for Studio Trigger\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Gorgeous, over the top action scenes\\n\r\n+ Unique art style\\n\r\n+ Funny/large scale plot line\\n\r\n+ Pure, thoughtless fun\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- 1 dimensional characters\\n\r\n- Inconsistencies in story delivery, and animation\\n\r\n- Gimmicks are over-used\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Kill la Kill, watch...\\n\r\nGurren Lagann\\n\r\nFLCL\\n\\n\r\n7.44/10 - Great",

            "content": "Something that Kill la Kill cannot lay claim to is being elegant or refined. It is a messy, wild, unruly show with a crazed plot and lots of shouting. It's a show that spends its entire runtime with zany antics, crude humor, and fighting, lots and lots of fighting. The plot bounces around like a pinball, going every which direction; defying logic as the twists become increasingly more ridiculous. Of course, this madcap nature is exactly what makes Kill la Kill so insanely entertaining. This is a rollercoaster of a show that flies off the rails, only to continue on-ward until it leaves the Earth'sorbit. And it is fun every second of the way.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill exists on its own plain of demented cartoon logic, light-years away from even the slightest semblance of reality. It's a place where high-schoolers rule authoritarian regimes with an iron fist. It's a place where an article of clothing can grant godlike superpowers. A place where people use things like iron-clad rulebooks, or wads of cash, as weapons. This setting of unhinged creativity could have only come from director Hiroyuki Imaishi and Kazuki Nakshima, the creative partnership behind the phenomenally popular and explosive Tengen Tappa Gurren Lagann. Kill la Kill is as deliriously over-the-top as that now legendary super-robot extravaganza, perhaps even more so. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is gloriously messy; a hurricane of outlandish ideas and outrageous twists. Our hot-headed protagonist Ryuuko is out for revenge. Her father was killed and her only lead to the murderer is a sword shaped like half of a scissor. Her quest for vengeance leads her to but heads with the charismatic and ruthless Satsuki Kiryuuin, the authoritarian president of the metropolis-like Honnouji Academy, who seems to know about the murder of Ryuuko's father. Satsuki takes an interest in Ryuko, especially after the latter finds a sentient school uniform which grants her incredible power. However, Satsuki's eyes are set on a much grander ambition than Ryuuko's, one that involves taking control of all the other school-cities.\\n\\n\r\nThis would probably be enough to fill the plot for an entire show, but it is only the tip of the iceberg for Kill la Kill. At first, it does follow a set formula for a few episodes, in which Ryuuko takes on one of Satsuki's lackeys a la villain-of-the-week. It doesn't stay like this for long, however, as a third faction called 'Nudist Beach' is introduced, Satsuki's elite four become more and more eager to fight Ryuuko, and Satsuki moves to fulfill her plans. Even that is not the end of it, though. Bigger and badder antagonists appear, changing the game and raising the stakes. Allegiances shift; former enemies become allies. Battles become more and more extravagant, as well as more outlandish. Twists become more impactful, even as they get increasingly more ludicrous. The plot accelerates to a climactic burst, only for it to be followed by another. By the end, Ryuuko's quest for revenge has become a full-on war for the survival of the human race. It is an exhilarating experience that has the audience throwing logic to the wind simply because the show is so much fun.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, a lot of the show's success has to do with Imaishi's direction. Though Nakashima's plotting and script are embarrassingly fun, without Imaishi's audacious direction they would cease to be so; they would just be embarrassing. There is an enormous amount of non-sequiturs and psudo-science nonsense in the script that ultimately means nothing because it is trying to explain the impossibilities that occur in the show. The plot itself is likely among the most illogical and nonsensical things ever written. However, none of this really seems to matter under Imaishi's direction. In fact, Nakashima's deranged ideas compliment Imaishi's bombastic yet honest direction as if the two were born to work together. Ridiculous as the show might be, it is equally as passionate. It's clear that Imaishi and Nakashima threw their collective powers together on this show (just as in TTGL), and had a damn good time doing it. As a result, the show is simply a blast to behold, nonsense and all.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, a large part of the enjoyment comes from the characters. This is a huge ensemble cast, and obviously most of these characters will be one note. Still, the characters here are every shade of likeable, even if they are not the most complex. Getting the most attention are Ryuuko, Satsuki, and Senketsu, Ryuuko's sentient uniform. Ryuuko's defining character trait is her hot-headedness, as she's quick to lose her temper and jump into battle. In some ways this trait is what makes her an admirable protagonist, as she is always willing to take action and fight the good fight. On the other, it makes her rash and impulsive, which can be problematic; this is especially true in the later stages of the show. Senketsu is more reserved than his fiery partner, and sometimes acts as a pacifier to her, which again comes into play in the later stages. Satsuki is a charismatic ice queen; constantly reserved (though not completely in the second half) and effortlessly cool. She's methodical, confident, and calculating; a perfect foil for Ryuuko. She inspires undying loyalty from her elite four, who all have distinct personalities on their own right. Then there is Ryuuko's best buddy, Mako, who is a hyperactive girl taken to the extreme. She's both fun and exhausting as a comedic character, her monologues are simply outrageous. All the other characters are colorful, but far less important. The two exceptions are the antagonists from the later half, who are both ruthless in their villainy and wickedly fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill's technical merits are just as wild and unruly as its narrative. Trigger is a new studio, it should go without saying that they don't have the financial backing that longstanding studio's like Madhouse and Production I.G. have. That said, they did an admirable job putting this show together. Yes, there are times when the animators were saving on budget, and they are very obvious while watching the show. At the same time, when it is time to show off, the animators go all out. More than a few of the fights in this show are breathtaking spectacles, likely to go down as some of the all-time best fights in any anime. The budget restraints are mostly felt in the comedic moments, where they will deal the least damage. The striking and colorful yet rough art direction also covers for the limited animation. The fanservice might be a bit too present and gratuitous for some, but it is appropriate considering the show's motifs involving clothing and nudity. It also makes the show a veritable man-child fantasy, which is entirely expected from Imaishi.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Hiroyuki Sawano is nothing short of fantastic. Sawano has been getting a lot of attention recently with is work on Blue Exorcist  and Attack on Titan, but this is arguably his best work so far. One reason is because how well the show utilizes its music. All of the main and important secondary characters get their own themes: from Ryuuko and Satsuki, to Mako and her family, to the elite four, and so on. Imaishi also puts the music to work in interesting ways, particularly in one battle between Ryuuko and Nonon from the elite four, as they fight with sound waves. The music itself is composed of booming and passionate insert songs which work phenomenally, and instrumental versions of those songs. There is also a little Beethoven in the soundtrack, which is always a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, Kill la Kill is absolutely insane in the best possible way. It isn't a particularly deep show, and claims that it 'saved anime' are as preposterous as some of the plot twists in the show. However, the fact of the matter is that this is one of the most purely enjoyable anime ever made. Kill la Kill is a show that doesn't stop to reflect on its crazed plot. Rather, it blasts full speed ahead, obliterating any notions of logic or moderation. And really, that is what makes it so endearing. It's a fearless show that pushes on ahead, no matter how crazy it looks as it goes along.\\n",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is an intensely popular and polarizing anime. It combines several genres of anime, takes the most titillating and ridiculous aspects of each, and throws them back at the audience with a heavy hand. \r\nI would describe Kill la Kill as a parody of anime based around high school, with the fanservice and hyperviolent nature of most shounen battle anime. \r\nThere are certainly impressive moments within Kill la Kill, however the excellent and irreverent plot slowly devolves into the common tropes the show originally meant to ridicule.\r\nDetailed scores:\r\nStory: 7\r\nI believe the plot of Kill la Kill has one of the most interesting hooksin recent history. \\n\r\nMany critics of anime consider most of them as power fantasies, pandering to an audience that is in high school and usually thinks they are the center of the universe. Kill la Kill makes those dreams come true in a dystopian future, where high school academies are the new bastions of humankind. Studio Trigger shoves a world where status in high school LITERALLY dictates every aspect of everyone's lives, and says \"Are you sure this is what you really wanted?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of revenge, identity, and even slut-shaming get explored within the first few episodes. This is accentuated by the fact that the first five or so episodes move at a lightning pace. Almost every major character for the first half of the show is introduced within the first two episodes, so the characters really have time to develop and endear themselves to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I give it a 7? Well, the second half of the anime is too busy tying up the loose ends placed in the first half in order to poke fun at modern anime culture. It stops trying to make fun of the \"power fantasy\" that anime brings (whether it be social, mental, or sexual power). The show stops making me think, and just makes me hooked enough to press play to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe only anime series I have ever watched with a similar art style to Kill la Kill would be Fist of the North Star, mixed with the character designs that wouldn't look out of place in a Crayon Shin-Chan or Dooly. The insanely dramatic and propaganda-inspired backdrops clash with the cartoonish characters in a great way. The art style actually caused some feelings of nostalgia for me, as if Trigger was appealing to those who grew up watching the aforementioned anime. \\n\\n\r\nStudio Trigger was founded by two former employees at Gainax, a company known for outlandishly stylish works like Gurren Lagann. This heritage is proudly presented in the animation style of Kill la Kill. \\n\\n\r\nBackdrops are introduced usually with a shot zooming out from a vantage point, as if the viewers are on a rocket flying away from the scene. \\n\\n\r\nBattle scenes are lovingly detailed and animated. The only recycled animations I could notice were the standard transformation and \"we're slashing swords so fast I don't need to animate the arms\". Glancing blows are rewarded with huge shockwaves and successful attacks result in destruction all around. \\n\\n\r\nThe humorous parts of Kill la Kill are (in my opinion) deliberately animated poorly or with insane amounts of repetition (series veterans will think of the term \"RYUUKO-CHAN\" here) in order to make fun of the characters or situations in front of them. Mako and the pervy homeroom teacher are the prime examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how else to describe the art style in words, just watching the first five minutes of the first episode will do more justice than what more I can write.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack consists of each major character's \"theme\". The OP and ED tracks for each half of the series are catchy, especially the ones with an electric guitar.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is spot on, with Ryuuko's tomboyish nature reflected in her voice and tone. The rapport between the Elite Four is fun to listen to. Even without looking at the screen, I could distinctly recognize who was speaking, something that I actually have trouble doing with most anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the music and sound design suffer from repetition. Particular offenders include the instrumental version of Ryuuko's \"don't lose your way\" track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nI am going to examine Ryuuko the most closely in order to justify my score. In one of the first episodes of Kill la Kill, Ryuuko decides she is sick of having everyone (including the viewer) gawk at her stripperific powered- up form. Trigger really had a great chance to criticize how essential fanservice has become with regard to an anime's success. People at Honnouji will pay huge amounts of money to watch well-endowed animated people fight to the death.  Are we, as consumers of anime, not the same?\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, none of these examinations are considered in a serious way in the storyline, and unfortunately Ryuuko turns into a female version of every shounen battler protagonist in the world. I do believe Ryuuko has a funny and likeable personality; it's just not one that defies genre stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki develops the most as a character throughout the series, and it was extremely satisfying to learn of her origins as a dictator, but also her own struggles dealing with the events within Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is intentionally filled with cringe-worthy moments in order to challenge and titillate the viewer towards a reaction. Eventually the parts of the anime that hooked me in were all gone, replaced by the standard revenge storyline and generic plot device of \"I need more power to beat this guy!\" The cynical message about the appeal of violence against females in modern media is replaced by insane amounts of female-on-female violence.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these concerns, I truly loved watching every battle scene and hilarious epiphanies by Mako. Kill la Kill is a rare anime that redeemed itself to me after my opinion went down after episode 12 or so. I began to enjoy it for what it was, not from what I expected to experience from the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI will repeat what I have said in the intro. \\n\\n\r\nThere are certainly impressive moments within Kill la Kill, however the excellent and irreverent plot slowly devolves into the common tropes the show originally meant to ridicule.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show to strangers whose tastes I don't know? \\n\r\nNot really. There's so many pieces of this show that can make or break it for a viewer, and it's hard to describe them without spoiling the plot.\\n\r\nWould I suggest a stranger give the first episode a try? Definitely. If you get hooked, prepare for a fun ride.",

            "content": "The savior of Anime and shitty fanservice garbage in one, it's Kill la Kill!\r\nStory:\r\nI think it's safe to say that the plot of KlK was just an excuse to do this show. Nonetheless, as weird and stupid as it may sound, it actually makes sense in itself (if you buy it, that is). Pretty much everything gets explained sooner or later (even why the Kamui outfit is so skimpy) so they at least tried. But honestly, it's not the pinnacle of storytelling. The plot is meh, the pacing is fast, the story development is good and the genre mixture is either hit or miss (dependingon the viewer, I liked it a lot).\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDepending on character and situation, the artwork shifts greatly from cutesy or comedic all the way to detailed and colorful. This isn't the best looking show out there, but it works well with the fast pacing of Kill la Kill. Every character looks unique, the technological advanced parts of the world look beautiful and the action scenes are flashy (and later on very bloody).\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDon't lose your waaaaay~...ahem, excuse me. Yes, the soundtrack of Kill la Kill is pretty awesome, be it the heroic theme song of Ryuko or the creppy villain theme. It all fits very well and gets you in the right mood for the scene your watching. On top of that, we are treated with some fine classical music everytime Nonon fights. Both openings and endings were good without being very memorable. The voice acting was over the top, which worked really well with the quirky characters.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHow do I talk about this without starting to sound like a fanboy? There is a huge pile of characters, but all of them are very unique and different, so you will not have any difficulties remembering names (I'm looking at you Bleach). They all fill their respective roles perfectly and leave their mark on the show. From funny (Mako) to serious (Ragyo) to outright creepy (Nui) you have something for everybody. I admit though, Mako is a character you either love or hate, because she keeps interrupting serious scenes with her comedic antics. Anyway, this is the strong point of Kill la Kill and I can't possibly imagine a better cast for any Anime.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nKill la Kill was fun fun fun. If you want something serious, ambitious or sophisticated, you wouldn't take a look at this Anime anyway, so for anybody who wants 24 episodes of non-stop high octane entertainment, this is what you're looking for. This show never bored me for even a second and I recommend KlK with a clear conscience.\\n\r\nOh, one more thing. Some people seem to dislike \"fanservice\" for whatever reason. Kill la Kill has a lot of naked and half-naked people on screen about 50% of the time. Just sayin.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.8/10",

            "content": "Another overhyped 'this will save anime' thing that gaijins love to gawk about. This anime had around the same cult hype as attack on titans. It tries to justify fanservice, average writing, and average art altogether as if this was some kind of masterpiece, when in reality it's amatuerly done. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nAnother one of those that goes with a bang and ends with dissapointment. In the beginning, its story was very well done and could've taken many directions. It was open minded and very fun to watch at, but as the episodes went by, I could do nothing but see in terror of what thisanime became after being hyped so much. They put pointless filler episodes and crappy story arcs which weren't needed for the overall story and enjoyment in Kill La Kill. Its story tries to be unique, but in reality its nothing more than a shadow of Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggen. Story was overall a dull experience with asspulls all around the place with a sad sad ending that was expected. This is another replica of a shonen clone that wasn't executed well. You can make an analogy of this show to a music song that was a 'one hit wonder'. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nSome people say that the art is good, but I really disagree in it. This anime tries to tie in silliness with seriousness, which doesn't blend in well and ultimately fails at it. The first couple episodes had solid art, but after that most of the episodes except the 'important' arcs in the story had mediocre-horrible art as if they didn't know how to distribute the production of an anime. Art just looks childish and it really TRIED to mix it with seriousness, but it failed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nThe only type of songs that are even close to mentioning are the action packed ones like they put in Fate/Zero(they all sound the same). It's not good, but solid. Nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters showed the same dissapointments as the story. None of the characters had depth or as they were all simple with little to no explanation for the side characters. The motivation for side characters were quite bad. Also one of the characters are so bad that they could be compared to Jar-Jar Binks by trying to forcing comedy into the viewer. Characters are simple and easy to understand, but none are interesting in general because their motivations, logic, value, etc are all explained in the simplest way possible and the viewers have to 'just' accept it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10 \\n\r\nEven with all the critical views in this average anime, the enjoyment of these series was very high though thanks to starting with the bang. But this shonen anime was quite interesting to watch despite the flaws. It was dead beat entertainment that was actually entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nEven with the enjoyment aside....This anime is one with flaws that could've been so easily fixed, but it just had to fit the meta of having over 20 episodes for an 'epic'. This anime is nothing to write about because behind all that hype, this anime is just another shonen-esque anime. This is a shadow of Trigger's past Tengen Toppan Gurren Laggen. Just watch it if you have the time, but if you don't, don't watch it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*Note* If you enjoyed Kill La Kill than reading this review, just to see how other people enjoyed it, is probably not for you. Even though I do praise it in some aspects, most of it will be criticisms.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nOh man where do I even begin with this? Basically in a nutshell: the story was all over the place. In the beginning, our main character, Ry\u016bko Matoi, ends up at a high school called Honn\u014dji Academy in search of answers about her father's death and the person that murdered him. So she goes around fighting every single person in the school that gets in herway to persuade Satsuki Kiry\u016bin, the only person that actually seemed to know what happened to her father. Now the second half was a complete mess where after she learned who did it, a very major plot twist happened where now instead of just killing the killer, she had to save all of humanity as well... yeah I'm serious. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nNot much to say about this. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible and it fit the anime well especially with the fight scenes. The problem is that if you're coming from an anime with a more \"modern\" art style it may take a few episodes to get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nProbably one of the best features about this anime is it's soundtrack! It's some of the best anime music I've heard from the openings to the endings, it's all good. I have no complaints. If you want a suggestion listen to Ragyo's theme!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nWell every character definitely had a defining personality that made them stand out in this anime. For example: the main character screamed everything she said or like how the TRUE antagonists were all psychopaths. However even so it just somehow worked and in the end you just had to love the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI won't lie I did enjoy the anime near the end, and because of that I didn't give it an awful rating. There were some very funny scenes that helped with the comedic relief of some of the more serious scenes, but in contrast to that there were also scenes (such as the transformation scenes) that just made me roll my eyes at how repetitive it was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nThis anime definitely wasn't perfect. There was a ridiculous amount of fanservice that could easily turn people off as well as questions that will never get answered, but I will say that it did have its moments.",

            "content": "When I first saw how much people loved this anime I was really shocked to be honest. Around my school I knew that it was very very well received and everyone was always excited for the next week of kill la kill but for some reason I was never like that, in fact the only reason I finished this anime was because all of my friends wouldn't stop pestering me about it so I guess I should say why I didn't like it.\r\nStory (4/10)\r\nThere is none plain and simple that's the point... right? Well sadly no there is a plot in this anime and it'snot interesting at all. I really enjoyed the first 13 episodes of kill la kill because it was what it wanted to be and it did that really well; however, after episode 13 everything just slowly went downhill until episode 17 where I quit watching it entirely for a few months because I just didn't care at all anymore. It tries to have a story about halfway through and it just... kill la kill stop... it tries to do too much is the best way to put it and the last 3 episodes just drag on forever and the joke gets taken to a point where I just wanted it to be over so badly but then it wasn't, but since the first half was okay I won't give it the worst score.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nHonestly this is Kill la Kill's saving graces, it's a wonderful thing to look at and does what few anime does in that it breaks out of the norm and really just gives your eyes something fun to look at (and doesn't just seem that way because of crappy budget), and while at some times it DOES seem that way for the most part it is nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nGood soundtrack. Don't like \"Don't lose your way\" nearly as much as anyone else though. Still, not a bad soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (1/10)\\n\r\nThis is where the show is at its overall worst, the characters in this anime have no substance and I guess that's what this anime is going for for the most part; however, I just didn't LIKE almost any of the characters. The only character I even slightly enjoyed was Gamagori and even then it wasn't a character I'd write home about. I know that the whole point of this anime was to satire the general anime conception but it took it way too far and left me with bland or way too over the top characters I just didn't care about in the slightest. The characters are fun but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half of kill la kill, it was stupid but it was fun and that's what mattered to me... and then it wasn't fun. At one point kill la kill stopped being what it was most importantly, pointless at least it tried to NOT be pointless and that's where its biggest fall was. It opened up so many plots that got shit on and left to rot in the dumpster and that made me so sad since they all seemed so interesting (like when senketsu went berserk only to find out that would never be explained or gone into detail again?) and the most important thing is, is that kill la kill has been done before, and better. Gurren Lagann in the first episode created more enjoyable characters and a more enjoyable experience than kill la kill did in it's entire series, and it stays that way the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kill la Kill isn't terrible, it just tries way too hard and loses it's way in the process (never been made before right?) It's not terrible, it's not good either though. It's mediocre and that's where I leave it on my anime list.",

            "content": "Trigger's highly acclaimed Kill la Kill came to a tremendous end in March and now that the dust has settled I thought it may be the perfect time to unfold it once again for my review. Let's take a look if the hype behind this show is justified or not.\r\nA plot summary has already been given in the detail section of the information page so I won't be doing one - it's literally one click away.\r\nLet's split up this review into the five categories as usual:\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nComing from a studio which participated in the making of the well-known Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and taking alook at the plot synopsis you should've already guessed that you are in for an over-the-top-action feast with almost no brakes on the hype train.\\n\r\nThat's only partly true. Kill la Kill does start of at an incredible speed introducing the large cast of characters while not refraining from leaving certain topics untouched such as the meaning of \"being human\" or even incest. \\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to this you have kind of a choring couple of episodes which more or less feel like real filler. Good thing is there is only a couple, like two or three. Also towards the end it tends to drag itself until the end where they can finally reveal the huge cliffhanger leading to the expected climax.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is nothing which stands out very much but I doubt it was expected from Kill la Kill in the first place. It's entertaining and suspenseful enough to keep you hooked throughout the ride but is too shallow for anything worthwhile. The plot twists in the middle arc definetly made up for the rather lame beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Kill la Kill is heavily double-edged. On the one hand it does fit the shows unrealistic themes and high-octane action quite well but on the other hand it's just ugly with quality being thrown around everywhere, the moving characters just becoming some blurred lines throughout the action scenes or just being animated horribly deformed. At this point I think Trigger just overdid their selves while planning the whole thing, not spreading the budget well enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt's certainly not horrible per say but it would have been nice to see Trigger trying to bring it down to a common denominator or at least trying to make use out of the saved budget as they did with Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann where the end was unquestionable the best thing the show had to offer in terms of as good as everything.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhile Kill la Kill does its best not to be a complete failure regarding art it does excel at sounding absolutely gorgeous. Sawano Hiroyuki (Attack on Titan) did his best to provide fitting bombastic themes (KIRYU HA KILL), slow and sad (Until I die) ones and even attempts in German songwriting with industrial sounds mixed underneath it (Blumenkranz) to set the mood perfectly and to get your blood boiling. \\n\\n\r\nOnly towards the end you realized that they were using the same tracks over and over again. This didn't stop me from downloading the whole Original Soundtrack though.\\n\r\nWhile we are at Kill la Kills best part we also have the outstanding voice acting. The characters have been hit right on the spot with their respective voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound Kill la Kill does as good as everything right. It's a feast for the ears to put it that way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill does offer every kind of character archetype you could imagine. The cast is incredibly huge and it doesn't feel like anyone is left behind in the development. Ryuko is the hot-blooded revenge seeking tomboy, then we have her comedy relief best friend Mako, the weirdo teacher Mikisugi and the evil tyrannical leader of the academy Satsuki who is ruling the school along with the Elite Four; the best trained students with the most powerful armors and the closest relationship to Satsuki.\\n\r\nAll in all the cast was very likeable with a few exceptions in my case which only happened to be supporting characters with no big influence.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said I didn't love watching Kill la Kill.\\n\r\nI got on hyped really, really quickly and found myself even streaming the lastest translated episodes because I couldn't bear waiting any longer - especially in the middle arc, which was fantastic. The action was great, the music was awesome and the characters were likeable as well. The only thing I didn't like that much was the immense fan service. Don't get me wrong: I could tell which way Kill la Kill was aiming for from just a few episodes but come on... Looking back at it, it could have done equally well if not better without nudity flashing everywhere you look. This is just opinion based though. If you have no problem with ecchi-like approaches then you are set and won't mind but there surely are people (like me) who find it rather annoying. It's just supposed to be a \"warning\" of some sort to this kind of people.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict (7/10*):\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill was an action-filled and entertaining watch definitely worth checking out if an absurd level of over-the-topness does not scare you away. Be warned that this show is mostly freaking stupid but equally freaking awesome.\\n\r\nFor action-fans Kill la Kill should be a must. If you are looking for a deep storyline with thought-provoking themes you are wrong here. This anime is just made for entertainment. You are better of turning off your brain while seeing Trigger playing around with almost every basic rule of how the world is supposed to work.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n*) Score is not an average",

            "content": "KILL LA KILL ULTIMATE REVIEW ATTACK THINGY SYKE   \r\nStory: 8\r\nSimilar to Gurren Lagann, this anime runs off pure enjoyment. However, it is pretty bad at being serious. We don't really remember the parts where Aikuro dumps a bunch of exposition like it's the bloody Ice Bucket Challenge. We remember the part where Satsuki just kicked a certain someone's buttocks. Also there was this one scene...in a bathtub...hang on I'm gonna drink more bleach.\r\nIt's hard to take seriously but dang does it entertain!\r\nPresentation: 5\r\nWhile the artwork for the characters, even when it makes Tumblr start rolling, looks pretty good. But this series seems tosay \"up yours\" to any sort of fluid animation. Even in fight scenes it seems the animation team was cutting several corners. Though some moments, like the one butt-kicking scene, and one scene with a flying dagger,and the pur...*drinks bleach*...excuse me..were very well animated. But most of the time it seems like a slideshow, even if it does seem to fit in well\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack. Makes anything seem epic. When you're taking a dump, the soundtrack will make it awesome. When you're taking a final, you're saving the world. When you're taking a bath...*more bleach*\\n\r\nThe over the top soundtrack goes well with the over the top nature of the show. Now only if they spent this much effort animating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nWe have a solid group of mains. Ryuko is alright. She has an intriguing backstory, even if she seems to go MAXIMUM EDGE a bit too often. Mako is passable as comic relief, but actually can be taken seriously on occasion, which is an A in my book. The real meat is Satsuki. If the story was from Satsuki's POV, it would be at least 19.99 percent cooler. Eh has a calm and cool personality and doesn't afraid of anything, despite the fact that [SPOILERS]\\n\r\nThe Elite Four are excellent companions for Satsuki, and have great personalities and solid backstories. \\n\r\nRagyo and Nui are threatening villains, even if they're a bit farfetched. Their rapiness does get very old after a while *shudders*\\n\r\nLet's just say Aikuro (aka Exposition Bin) got annoying and only is notable for \"nudisto, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETCH\"\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\r\n8/10 \\n\r\nWould watch again\\n\r\nBUT I'M SKIPPING THE PURIFICATION SCENE NEXT TIME\\n\r\ntrigger you sick pervs\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: MEDIUM HIGH\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think it is safe to say that Kill La Kill is the most hyped up anime of 2014, but as the time showed us more than once, hyped up does not always mean good. I myself did not have the greatest experience with the hyped anime series of the past few years. I found Sword Art Online atrocious and Attack on Titan while not bad, still not even nearly as good as people made it out to be. When I started watching Kill La Kill I was a bit sceptical for two reasons: 1) Too much Hype and 2) I am against fanservise.\r\nStill withall that being said I am proud to say that Kill La Kill is one of the few shows in past years that actually deserve that level of hype. The writing, directing, pacing, soundtrack, characters and austesics are all on extremely high levels.\\n\\n\r\nThere were 2 great things that I  immeadiatly noticed when I started watching Kill La Kill:\\n\\n\r\n1) The first one was direction, animation and austetics. It was easy to understand that show was original and not and adaptation of any manga. You could see in the animation and the whole direction of the show that it was not just connecting key images with animation. It was using the freedome of animation and it's possibilities at their full capacity. The show's animation frequently jumps from maginificent and detalied to barely animated stills. It would be a huge problem if not for the fact that this show uses stills in a perfect fasion for comedy or for some memorable shots. Even when the animation is not that good throughout the episode, it still fits the show's mood very well.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that the show is full of visual puns, references and some shots so unbelivable you will have to straight up pause to absorb what the show just visualy threw at you. The great thing is that Kill La Kill does not hang up on it and acts like all of these ridicilous things are a norm which creates even a better impact for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe design and austetics in this show are majestic. The characters all look beautiful and distinct. The venues, locations, cities, buildings, weapons and everything else looks like quite nothing you have ever seen before.\\n\\n\r\n2) The second thing I have noticed was almost pitch perfect pacing. This show has no fillers, no episodes that do not add up to the overall narrative and story. Every episode is usually packed with something great that will hold your attention and make you want to see what is next. Towards the end the pacing becomes faster and more energetic which is fine by me, but I have prefered the pacing of the first 15 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the story:\\n\\n\r\nYes it is a tale of a girl getting revenge and finding out more about her father and family but rest assured that it is only a small fraction of what the story of this anime has to offer. While I will not be spoiling the story of the show too much though. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has many underlying themes. There are more apperent once like the commentary on nudity and shame and some that you have to look deeper into show's history to find. Still people have come up with many interesting iterations of this story which will make you view anime in the whole different light.\\n\\n\r\nThe great thing about the story of this anime....well and this anime overall is that if you are a viewer who just likes popcorn flicks or does not like to think too much about the shows they have watched, then this show will provide tons and tons of entertainment on the whole other level compared to the majority of other shows. If you on the other hand like to analize your shows, comic books, anime or whatever, you will find tons of things to analize and look into in this show. Appealing to two of such different demographics is an unbelievebly hard task which Kill La Kill does magnificently.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI will also say a few things about the characters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this shows are mostly awesome. I loved Maco who is like your comedy reliefe and secondary character on crack. She will proved tons of awesome and fun moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is good. The voice actor did a great job protraying her. She is not the most interesting character but I still really liked her. \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki though might just be the most interesting and cool character in this whole show. Explaining her will require to spoil the show to death so I will not do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe strenght of the characters in this show is that even if they are not deep or intruiging, the show will give you bunch of reasons to love them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSomething had to be said about the soundtrack. Really this is easily among THE BEST anime soundtracks I have ever heard. The whole soundtrack is a thing of beauty. It does a great job enhancing the already great experience that is that show. \\n\\n\r\nAlso one of the last things I had to talk about is the infamous fanservice in this show. Well what can I say...there is a lot of it in this show. Still it plays a huge role in the narrative of this show and it's narratives. The proportions are not realistic. There are no nipples nor pubic hair. As a heterosexual male I can honestly tell you most of the time I have not even found the fanservice sexy and did not mind it too much. That comes from a guy who is usually stricktly against the fanservice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall Kill La Kill is an exeptional show the likes of which come out very rare. It is beautifly directed, amazingly looking, smartly written and has magnificent soundtrack. Don't misunderstand me it has some flaws. For instance Nudist Beach was pretty useless overall and not fully realized. Some character faded into obscurity and I wanted to see more of them. The thing is that there are very few negatives but the positives...well they hit you hard and they hit you on every level that counts.",

It seems kind of repetitive, of course you soon realize that Kill la Kill doesn't lay out everything in the first couple of episodes. It is a show that has a wild sense of humor along with some really dark material. It is also one of the very few shows I've seen to use fan service cleverly and integrate it into the plot.\r\nIn this show fan service means more than things to be putinto the show to arouse the audience, it actually is a weapon. The characters are completely fleshed out, they are for the most part with maybe the exception of Mako generally well written, but the best written character is without question Satsuki Kiryuin, who is probably one of the greatest female anime characters I've seen, without giving much away her story arc and growth is absolutely incredible.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be expected from the same team behind Gurren Lagann (albeit under a different name) the animation is absolutely incredible and it's clear that Trigger put their heart and soul into this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Voice over performances I watched this one dubbed, I don't think I heard a single voice that sounded out of place, it's one of the best dubs I've watched. The voice actors manage to keep up to the frenetic energy level of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is maybe the best anime that has aired in the 2010s or so with only Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Psycho Pass and Mushi-shi The Next Passage, to even come close to it. Highly Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "\u201cJust rip it off and get naked!\u201d \u2013 Mako Mankanshoku\r\nWhen I started watching Kill La Kill, I really wasn't ready to be sucked into this colorful and over-the-top world full of awesome fighting, nudity, and Mako\u2019s inspirational speeches, but the more I watched, the more I got into its style. It engrossed me with its use of fast and frantic animation and very punchy directing and in turn made me appreciate some subtle things about similar shounen-esque action anime which I usually overlooked since I was always focused on action parts of it.\r\nWith that being said, plot of Kill La Kill is rather simple,it is about a 17-year-old tomboy protagonist, a real roughrouser, called Ryuko Matoi, who\u2019s looking for her father\u2019s killer. Her search leads her to Honnouji Academy, where she's looking to find answers trying to fight her way trough. But as the story progresses it keeps getting crazier, with sentient sailor uniforms appearing, one of which is Senketsu that gives its user immense power and ability to further transform in order to adapt to various situations. This was done in a very Tokusatsu-style fashion, except that Senketsu, the sailor outfit, is also its own character. Its there to be calm, composed and analytical to contrast and guide Ryuko trough her story. Not just a garment but also a friend.\\n\\n\r\nNow, many critics have given Kill La Kill flak for appearing to be more about style than substance and that it is too brash and loud for it's own good. But style IS substance. Aesthetic of the show is its narrative. Kill La Kill is not just about a girl duking it out in her sailor moon outfit, it is about acceptance, the power of hope, friendship, familiy, love and at the very centre of it is Ryuuko and her rivlarly against Satsuki Kiryuin, president of Honnouji Academy. And this relationship Ryuuko shares with Satsuki was the height of the show for me, since it's not your typical shounen-esque \"good vs bad\" but more like \"chaos vs order\" kind of thing, which each one of them respectively embodies, as they are the driving force of this show.\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of puns and references in this anime where fashion is related to fascism. The idea is that clothes control everything about society and that they represent enslavement. The whole series is really an exploration about the complex relationship between humans and clothing and what better way to explore such a theme than using hot girls in sailor outfits! It manages to be fun and tells a point at the same time.\\n\r\nEach of the three Kamui represent the three rites of passage that a woman goes through between different stages in her life and sexuality.\\n\r\nUniform Ryuko wears, Senketsu (first blood) represents the start of puberty and is modeled as a school uniform.\\n\r\nJunketsu (purity) represents marriage and is modeled as a white wedding dress. It's also likely that the whole premise of it overwhelming the user until it is retailored with Ryuko's blood and Senketsu's fibers is supposed to be a metaphor for marriage and family.\\n\r\nAnd finally, Kouketsu (silk) represents pregnancy and motherhood.\\n\r\nAs you watch the show, all of this comes into place and is thematically coherent.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki was definetly my favorite character, not only because of her design, but because of her role in the show. She has everything: real strength, leadership skills, she's patient and calculating with badass sword skills and loyal followers. Each time I see a .gif of her heel clicking I can hear her theme playing. But that's not the say other characters and their relationshp were not fun to watch, too. You had the protagonist Ryuuko, whom I wrote about earlier. She was potrayed as a bit agressive with a bit of flair to her, if not a bit edgy at times, but she had real shounen protagonist heart. Then you got Mako who appears to be more of a comic relief side character at first but she really has her own proper role in the show and wasn't sidetracked into being a lame supporting character. Then you got some other characters like Nonon who is just snarky all the time but simultaneously fun for me to observe and villians like Nui who's role is to just be annoying, I guess. Or someone like Ryugo who has the most fabulous looking resplendent multi-colored hair, with a silver color on top and is the best mom (not really). The show definitely has a nice cast of characters to offer, in terms of both character design and personality. Each one of student council's Elite Four characters was fun addition to the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I want to point out is the use of \"fanservice\" in this show. Kill La Kill took all those skimpy outfits that you see most mahou shoujo anime girls wear and gave a justified reason for it It. It really reconstructed this entire feeling of shame by watching something which has nudity in it since Satsuki herself explained that nudity is nothing to be ashamed of as long as it serves a purpose, and that to feel embarassed about it proves how you lack conviction. It has this theme of sexualization as empowerment to it, which was done well. This is why the ecchi part of the show really shined here since it was woven within the shows narrative properly and it didn't feel forced at all, unlike in most shounen shows where fanservice feels out of place and not really adding anything to the show (I'm looking at you, Fairy Tail). So even if you're not a fan of ecchi anime at all, you can still see how it was done well in Kill La Kill. It also had creative and fun use of censorship, just look at how Aikurou Mikisugi, member of Nudist Beach (awesome name btw) loves taking his shirt off and how long it takes him. Everything that had to be censored was censored just right.\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill draws a lot of inspiration from its spiritual predecessor, Gurren Lagann, and while it pays homage and references to it (and some other anime, too), it is very different in its themes and plot. It shares more plot superficialities with something like Utena. You can say that Kill La Kill is like a shounen, less psychological, version of Revolutionary Girl Utena, in a way. And both have \"revolution\" aspect to it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic accompanied this anime well, each theme fit their respective character well and was mixed in properly into the background. I was always hyped seeing, for example, Nonon being accompanied by her marching band. Or always hyped to hear Satsuki's theme after her heel clicked and she made her grandiose appearance on screen. It also followed fight choreography on point.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you'll give Kill La Kill a try after reading this review and embrace this fun mix of straightforward adaptation of standard action anime tropes with to-the-point storytelling and have as much blast watching it as I did!",

            "content": "Edited for reasons.\r\nKeep in mind, this is more of an analysis than a review, and yes, I realize that I am probably overanalyzing it.\r\nKill la Kill is an anime that can stand solely on it's visuals. It's not that any other parts were poorly done, but the direction and details incorporated so much world building, character definition, and thematic elements that I could have watched it in Japanese without subtitles and I don't feel like my experience would have changed in any substantial way, wait, there's Satsuki's magnificent quotes. Okay, everything about it is incredible.. Again, it's not that the dialogue was unnecessary or bad,the visuals were just THAT good. I need examples for this, I'll try to refrain from spoilers as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is about a high school girl named Satsuki Kiryuin who uses her mother's success to create her own town with its high school situated at the top and turns it into a fascist dictatorship. She uses clothing to control the population, both offering upward mobility to those who follow her lead, and using the Goku uniforms power to oppress those who don't. The skimpiest outfits are the most powerful, but only if you aren't embarrassed to wear them. This should have already triggered something in your brain. Clothing as a means of oppression in high school? linking embarrassment and empowerment? these are things that are already present in our daily high school lives and Imaishi simply exaggerates these themes to the point of absurdity. I'll get to this in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the first episode. Even in the first 10 seconds of the show, the atmosphere and style are illustrated in incredible detail. The industrial class room with the battleship door along with the brief exposition about the Nazis winning world war II makes it clear that this is a militarized society, even schools are effected (and as the episode progresses, we learn that this school actually epitomizes this). Then Gamagoori's foot smashes through the door, the scene is thrown into chaos and Gamagoori squeezes through the door, towering over everyone even the teacher. This first scene makes several things clear; The animation style is not meant to be literal, Gamagoori isn't actually 20 feet tall (we seem him at normal height a few seconds later). Rather, the series uses gross exaggeration to get a message across. Gamagoori is a dominating figure, even the teacher is beneath him, and that brings me to my next point. The hierarchy is not what you'd expect, an elite group of students are the ones who really hold the power. The teacher is sent sliding away from Gamagoori on his knees and a sequence of events follows in which Gamagoori beats a student to death in a spectacular fashion.\\n\\n\r\nLet's give one more example, Mako doing manual labor. The scene depicts her passing objects don a line of people, like how the bucket of water is passed down the line in Little Rascals. Mako isn't literally passing boxes down a long line of completely identical goons (although I guess she might be, Kill la Kill is pretty silly like that), but rather, the scene is meant to describe the highly mechanical process in which the labor is carried out. It's was able to convey this idea in a span of about 3 seconds, and the entire show packed this densely with narrative and developmental visuals.\\n\\n\r\nElaborating on these specific scenes is necessary to explain just how much this show relies on imagery to convey information to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThematic Elements:\\n\r\nIt is likely that dozens, if not hundreds of people have attempted to enumerate and discuss all the themes present in this show. A book that detailed these theories in their entirety would like fill thousands of pages, so I wouldn't doubt that most of those theories are pure fantasy. I will attempt to explain the themes that are obvious from the world and the events in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe manipulation of a population through greed and social constructs is the immediately recognizable theme. Goku uniforms are status, a better standard of living, and the power to dominate others, much like symbols of status in the real world. However, this is taken to the extreme as is everything else in Kill la Kill. Since Honnouji academy, and the city it's built on are ruled by a governing body with the ability to hand Status and power (see Goku uniforms) out as they choose, they can completely control the population by playing on peoples desperation and greed. People will literally kill each other over these uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nNudity is another idea presented in Kill la Kill. Make no mistake, this show will likely have more fan service than any non ecchi show you have ever seen, and while nudity is used for a \"higher purpose\", the show still has all the revealing camera angles that many anime fans have become accustomed to. However, I would argue that these camera angles reflect how the audience (because these scenes always happen in front of an audience within the show) are meant to better show how shame plays into everything.\\n\\n\r\nSo how is nudity used? Firstly, nudity is portrayed as a symbol shame, and later empowerment as the series progresses. Something is symbolism because of it's place in the story, nudity is consistently associated with freedom and clothing is consistently associated with oppression. The Kamui are unique, they are distinguished from the other Goku uniforms both in power and style, telling us that the main characters, Satsuki and Ryuuko,are different, they possess the resolve to succeed outside the confines of the system or to rise to the top of it, which is what Ryuuko and Satsuki respectively attempt to do, but in order to reach your final form, you can't be held back by embarrassment.\"The fact that you are embarrassed by the values of the masses only proves how small you are!\" This may be one of Satsuki's most important quotes, it ties the ideas of oppression and conformity to nudity, forming a cohesive argument with two distinct themes. But simply alluding to social constructs does not make them an underlying theme in the show, the story and characters have to reflect them as well. And they do. Let's break it down.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki and Ryuuko, some of my favorite characters of all time, both for their development, and for what they represent. Satsuki is the pinnacle of femininity and authority, she is the ideal citizen elevated to god-like heights by her willingness to submit to the typical gender roles and her resolve to impose these roles on everyone else with absolute authority. This is depicted symbolically in the form of a wedding dress, Juketsu (purity). This symbol comes up frequently and is always associated with matrimony, conformity, traditional gender roles, all that jazz, and Ryuuko is not having any part of that. Satsuki spends much of the show trying to force Ryuuko to behave and not be a delinquent lesbian who wears black and red. Satsuki wears Junketsu, a metaphor for her beliefs while Ryuuko wears Senketsu, who is way sexier.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko and Senketsu form the counter argument to Satsuki. What is at first a story of a girl trying to find her fathers killer becomes one of that girl tearing down a system of oppression, Senketsu constantly badgers Ryuuko about how she is wearing him but has yet to put him on, a reference to how her shame is preventing her from reaching her true potential. They grow closer throughout the series until the ending drives home the ideas the show had been working towards until that point. Unfortunately, her development can often come off as teenage angst, and it can be hard to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is perhaps most impressive is how the show uses it's high school setting to connect high school dynamics to it's ideas of conformity and oppression. The Principle says something very important in the first episode \"we are but mere pawns, Satsuki is the schools true master\" that's not word for word, but the idea is the same, in Kill la Kill Satsuki, the Student Council President, is literally a fascist dictator. This is also true in a sense in real life. The school administration can suspend you, or tell you to wear a longer skirt, but ultimately, it's peer pressure that impacts your behavior the most, the desire to fit in. Ryuuko's friendship with Mako is important because she is basically immune to peer pressure, giving Ryuuko confidence, and slapping her back to reality when she decides to act like a big fat idiot.\\n\\n\r\nEvery other student is dependent on Satsuki's system, and if we look at this as a normal school anime, which isn't far off if you scale back the over the top style, it's about  a troublemaker (Ryuuko) who gets transferred to a super uptight school after beating people up in her previous schools. Satsuki uses her position as the most popular girl in school to try and force Ryuuko to conform to her standards. She uses peer pressure by telling everyone else in the school to attack Ryuuko, and later even tries to turn her friends against her. Using greed and the desire to fit in to manipulate people is behavior prevalent in both high school and the practice of tyrants, and this double layer allows Kill la Kill to flesh out more ideas in greater detail, showing how the methods of dictators are used in other aspects of our lives.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetic:\\n\r\nThe color palette is perfect, the shots of Honnou city give a good sense of what this city is like without devoting too much time to it, a single 5 second pan out is enough to tell you more about the setting than most shows accomplish in their entire run time. This is why \"show don't tell is so important\".\\n\\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! Kill la Kill's story is built from the ground up upon the tropes of high school and shonen genres. The overblown importance of the student council? Well this student council is a fascist dictatorship. The bizarre obsession with school clubs? In Kill la Kill, club success directly influences your quality of life. No star students like Mako live in the slums while the one stars live in condos. Beyond that are ludicrously ornate mansions. Fights are decided with asspulls, and how do you beat an asspull? with an even bigger asspull of course! Ryuuko isn't some stubborn twelve your old who doesn't afraid of anything, she runs from fights she can't win and \"cheats\" too! The most obvious one is the incredible roast of the \"Woman wearing improbably skimpy clothing in a wildly inappropriate setting\" cliche. A fair number of anime tend to feature characters like Yoko who are inexplicably wearing a bikini in a post apocalyptic setting, I'm sure you've seen many examples of your own. By using the skimpiest costumes allowed on TV, and trying it into the core themes and plot of the show, we get something that is simultaneously epic, hilarious, and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDON'T LOSE YOUR WAY!!!!!!!!!!\\n\r\nKill la Kill features the best OST I have ever heard in my life. This is one aspect of the show that is almost unanimously agreed upon. It's so fantastically dramatic, every song so epic, that it will give you goose bumps and get your blood pumping. Listening to it will running fills me with strength. All of the voice actors are spot on as well and I can't imagine changing any of them. Just like it's art style and animation, this is literally perfect.\\n\\n\r\nWeak points:\\n\r\nEpisode 4, the only filler episode. This was by far my least favorite episode and not just because it could be removed without effecting the plot at all. Any ideas were already presented in previous episodes. If nothing else it show cases the ridiculous schemes Honnouji academy will utilize to weed out the weak. The tropes are overdone and overwhelming, I was hesitant about continuing the show after this episode because I was worried the series would devolve into episodic, nosebleed inducing nonsense. It didn't and I'm relieved. It should be noted however, that like the rest of the show, this episode likes to blow a lot of cliches out of proportion, accidental groping -> nosebleed -> head injury, but oddly enough, this actually becomes relevant to the subplot of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe show goes in a different direction after episode 12. I suppose you could say that it starts to take itself \"seriously\", but it never loses its insane style. Be warned, many people find the show becomes immensely better, or immensely worse after this episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle episodes could be described as the low point in the series depending on how much you enjoy the action and comedy, and whether you become annoyed with the slow plot progression during this time. The bigger issue is that most of the themes I've discussed, the character development, and the best fights take place in the first and last thirds of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is my favorite anime of all time but I also believe it is one of the most important releases ever. This is animation and direction perfected. Not only that, it tells multiple narratives simultaneously that all explore its core ideas and every individual piece of symbolism has multiple meanings. This kind of metanarrative is exceedingly rare, so I challenge you to watch this, and analyze it in depth, wear your detective hat, because no matter how incredible this show is on the surface, it gets immensely better the more work you put into it.",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying that this review is my opinion only and I will admit I am a bit biased towards this particular anime, that being said...\r\n\"I MUST STRIP!\"\r\nThere, right there in episode 3, is when I knew it was going to be like Gurren Lagaan. Kill la Kill is an original anime produced by Studio Trigger, the send-off from Gainax, the studio that made Gurren Lagaan. \r\n*WARNING*\r\nThis review is a bit lengthy and if you do not wish to read it all go with my rapid summary TL;DR: It blew my mind out more than a gun ever could\r\nStory: The story goes somethinglike this: Girl, namely Ryuuko, wants to find her Father's Murderer, and goes to an academy to find some answers; she ends up getting screwed over, then finds a talking uniform, dubbed, Senketsu. She proceeds to use Senketsu to attack the students, who also wear superpowered \"goku uniforms\" and finds a rival in Satsuki Kiryuin(sorry for misspelling). Well my reasoning for this is basically the regular stuff, since i cant spoil too much out of the first few episodes, but anyone who has seen gurren lagaan knows exactly how they pace the series. the plot twists and rapid pacing contribute to the story for sure, but that was partly the problem, it went too fast. overall though, the story was still very entertaining. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Okay, I wont call it the BEST art I've seen out of the season, but it has the comical consistency of gurren lagaan that I have always enjoyed, and completely enthralls me to glue my eyes to the screen. If you watch closely, the animation does dip past episodes 3-5, but still was good for the budget that Trigger could provide, which is pretty damn good. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \"DON'T LOSE YOUR WAYYYYYYY!!!!!\" The soundtrack was most likely the part that sold me in the beginning, even when i thought the concept was a bit sketchy. The music in the soundtrack is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who in my opinion is Godsent from the heavens, cause this guy knows how to write some badass tracks. from \"Before my Body is Dry\" to \"Blumenkranz\" to \"Light your Heart up\" I raised my volume to max every time cause i wanted to actually listen to the music more than the anime at times. all in all, I actually believe this soundtrack is better than Attack on Titan's. The openings, \"Sirius\" and \"Ambiguous\" by Aoi Eir and Garnidelia respectively, were probably the ramp for me to epicness. Ambiguous especially, made my mind blow when I heard the chorus. The endings, \"Gomen ne, Iiko ja Irarenai\" and \"Shin Sekai K\u014dky\u014dgaku\", although they didn't hype me up like the openings, were pleasant to hear. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Let's face it, no matter how much you think you hate Mako, in the end you can't hate her. The characters aren't as developed as in a romance or drama anime, but they were all entertaining enough for me to love each of them in my own way(except Ragyo and Nui, Screw them -.-). Even the antagonists were well based upon, I couldn't HELP but hate them, but I guess that is the goal of an antagonist. Aside from that, the voice actors are very good at their job, perfectly portraying the voices and feeling of each character, even though I couldn't understand the Japanese, I definitely felt the message of the character come through. Very big props to the voice of the homeroom teacher, Aikuro Mikisugi, Shin-ichiro Miki, the guy made me want to spit out soda each time he obsessed over \"DTR!!!\" 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you couldn't tell by the amount of detail I'm trying to put into this review, I LOVE THIS ANIME. I usually don't admit that due to people disagreeing with me, but right now, I really don't care, cause I can't help but love it, the show did gurren lagaan's creators justice, and added onto epicness. sure, I wasn't part of the hype train initially, but after finishing it, I feel very satisfied enough to go out and ride that train to America. All in all, it was a superb piece of work, and I cannot say everyone will love it just as I did, but I can say that everyone will find an element in the show that they will love. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: From the moment I saw the epic scenery of Honnouji Academy to the closing credits, Kill la Kill has been one of the most entertaining experiences I could ever have watching anime. It is action-packed, full of comedy and witty word-play, and can get serious to the point where you need to back off the screen in fear of the character jumping at you. The fast paced, epic action of Kill la Kill is not to be missed, even if the audience is varied, the anime is serious, downright goofy, and epic at the same time. At this time Kill la Kill is not released in North America or other countries, but has been licensed by Aniplex of America, so expect a release in the upcoming year or winter 2014. \\n\r\nTo all of you that have read this review and not watched Kill la Kill, I implore you to watch it (there is a free hype train ticket in your email).10/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nIf there are any flaws you would like to point out, (obviously my one-sided nature to this) you can message, or comment me with any criticism/questions/random bashing :)",

The narrative just runs forward and doesn't stop - it bumps into you from every direction, hitting you with surprises, twists and even the kitchen sink. Sequence after sequence will smack you, leaving you laughing at one moment, then gasping at another.\r\nThe series bombards you with subtexts and allegories that you're never given time to analyze.

I must suspect the author's held these ideas inside for a long time, because of the cathartic manner in which they're unleashed.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill's a series that's completely self-aware.

            "content": "Kill la Kill is an edgy action anime with a unique story. It is fun to watch; however, at a technical level, I found it below average and dumb at times. \r\n   The story starts off fine and epic, for the first half. Commence a series of asspulls to extend the plot- they also don't make much sense at all. It would've done better to avoid the out of place fanservice, and instead focus a bit on the plot holes. 3/10, was entertaining to watch what was happening- requires brain to be off to understand though. My biggest problem wasthat the show couldn't stay serious or funny. Its tones were all over the place, ruining this anime. \\n\\n\r\n   The art was different and unique, but looked sloppy in the end. It was unappealing to my eyes and everyone I've talked to about this. Objectively speaking, it is well animated and the action scenes do look better. I may have not liked it, but the art might be the best part about KlK. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n   The music wasn't anything special. \"Don't lose your way\" is the only song of significance, and is overplayed at that. 5/10\\n\\n\r\n   The characters Ryuuko and Satsuki are interesting in their development, but I didn't care for any other characters, some of them ruining moments (*cough* Mako *cough*). 5/10\\n\\n\r\n   I enjoyed the first half or so, for it had so much potential. After the plot crevasses that obliterated all logic hit, I lost my way. 4/10\\n\\n\r\n   Overall, 5/10 is an average-ish anime, but i'd still recommend this anime. It isn't good, far from it, but everyone sees anime differently.",

            "content": "There\u2019s an old saying, that \u2018clothes make the man.\u2019  At Honnouji Academy, however, clothes make more than just the man...  They make the warrior, they make the authority, and they separate the powerful from the weak.  You see, at this school, classes are more than just those things you struggle to stay awake through while dreaming about the dreamy classmate a few seats over...  They\u2019re the things you\u2019re bound by, as part of an ironclad caste system.  Depending on your level in that caste system, you may or may not be given a Goku uniform, which are special school uniformsthat amplify the natural abilities and club-related interests of their respective wearers.  The more powerful the uniform, the more stars you\u2019re granted, from one to three...  With the very top position occupied by the stone-faced, cold-hearted Satsuki Kiryuin, the Student Council President who runs the school as if it\u2019s her own personal dictatorship.  She lords over her school, which itself lords over the town, with no living being opposing her rule.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Ryuko Matoi, a teenage nomad with a chip on her shoulder and one half of a giant pair of scissors by her side, looking for answers regarding the mysterious death of her father and taking no prisoners in her quest for those answers.  With a unique sentient Goku uniform named Senketsu by her side, a hyper best friend giving her a place to stay, and a shady teacher constantly trying to convince her to get naked(for surprisingly non-rapey reasons), will this loudmouthed punk have what it takes to raze Satsuki\u2019s rubric regime, or is she facing a literal uphill battle that she can\u2019t possibly win?\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t read my April reviews, I like to describe Studio Gainax\u2019s animation quality as being \u2018inconsistent.\u2019  Considering how abundant this problem is, I would expect the same from any animation studio that could ever spin off from Gainax...  And yet, Studio Trigger has proven me wrong.  Trigger was founded by two of Gainax\u2019s former members, Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Ohtsuka, as they left the company in 2011.  Yes, this studio is only four years old, with only a few titles under their belt, and yet they produced one of the most unique visual wonders of that time period.\\n\\n\r\nI have never seen an anime that looked quite like Kill La Kill before.  It seems to take the fast paced frenetic action of Gurren Lagann and combine it with the smooth, western character and art design of Panty and Stocking, effectively taking the best aspects of both shows while cancelling out the ugly shortcuts that originally plagued them.  This makes it look more like a Looney Toons project than anything you\u2019d naturally expect from the anime medium.  Only, you know, with boobs instead of rabbits.  It completely avoids the awkward frame rate drops that normally occur whenever the action speeds up in a Gainax show, and which is normally my biggest complaint about their animation, managing to look smooth even through it\u2019s more demanding shots.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, whether it\u2019s able to do this because they have a relatively high budget or because they\u2019re extremely good at managing an average budget, I honestly can\u2019t tell.  It uses a lot of your classic moneysaving shortcuts, such as items and people moving as though they\u2019ve just been cut out of the screen via photoshop, but they\u2019re used so deliberately and so stylistically that it\u2019s difficult to tell whether or not it was ever done out of necessity.  Even when the characters have been reduced to frozen talking heads, there will almost always be something else moving on screen, whether it\u2019s the clouds in the background, someone\u2019s hair in the wind, or even just the design on their uniform.  This is a really good line to blur, and it keeps up really well with the breakneck pace of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the outstanding art direction and exquisitely detailed backgrounds don\u2019t hurt, either.  There was a lot of great care taken with the visual aspect of this series, from the memorable character designs that tell you volumes about the students and soldiers they correspond to before you even hear them speaking, to the CG art that somehow looks natural, even when it shares screen time with the two-dimensional aesthetic of the characters.  The soundtrack is surprisingly subtle, being one of the only aspects of Kill La Kill that comes even close to that word.  I don\u2019t even really want to call it background music, as it\u2019s never wasted on scenes that don\u2019t need it...  It\u2019s more like support music, used to amplify the effectiveness of action scenes and emotional climaxes, or just as tonally appropriate themes for the central characters.  The two most memorable tracks...  Aside from the awesome opening and closing themes...  are the chilling theme music that heralds the terrifying villain Nui Harime, and the blood pumping Before My Body is Dry, which kicks in with the scream \u201cDon\u2019t lose your way\u201d every time Ryuko turns the tide in battle.  And as for the canon in-story music?  You know your soundtrack is going to be awesome when one of your primary villains uses a marching band for a weapon.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had seen the English dub by this time last year, it would have instantly had a guaranteed spot on my \u201cFavorite Anime Dubs\u201d post, and for pretty much the same reasons that Toradora made it in.  Hell, this dub is so perfect that the two shows probably would have tied for second place, which isn\u2019t surprising since they were released by the same company at around the same time.  Fledgling voice actor Erica Mendez, who got her start only a few years ago by playing the voice of Rainbow Dash in several Brony videos, proves her mettle as the tough, gravelly voiced Ryuko, having no trouble navigating this probably throat-destroyingly intense role through all of it\u2019s complexity.  Christine Marie Cabanos shows us once again how awesome she can be when used properly, keeping up admirably in her role as the fast-talking Looney Toon Mako.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to pick a standout performance in a dub where everyone is so perfect in general, but if I had to choose a favorite, there are two that come to mind, and they\u2019re both supplied by veteran voice actors with some serious clout in their filmographies.  The first one is Carrie Keranen, who\u2019s probably most well known for playing Casca in Berserk, and in Kill La Kill, she plays the duplicitous school dictator Lady Satsuki.  Her voice is very strong and powerful throughout the series, making for some very rousing speeches, with a sense of restraint at other times that hides the duality of her character.  The other one is Stephanie Sheh, who is known for regularly getting typecast, and then stunning the crap out of people whenever she breaks away from her squealing moe mold.  She has a lot more talent than people give her credit for, and it\u2019s never been more apparent than in her portrayal of Nui Harime, who doesn\u2019t come into the series until an Earth-shattering reveal at the halfway point.  Her voice is sweet, high pitched, and overly-affectionate, yet Sheh\u2019s performance is still dripping with malice and cruelty below the surface.  Over-all, the dub is just as good as the sub, so you should be able to watch either track without complaint.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re watching Kill La Kill for the first time, it is perfectly understandable to go through a case of some sensory overload. This series hits the ground running, assaulting you with it\u2019s ridiculous premise, it\u2019s complicated plot, slapstick, stylized violence and constant, gratuitous, unapologetic fan service from both genders.  It can become confusing very early on, and what\u2019s worse, it might even lose your interest by the end of disk one.  It\u2019s a lot to take in, and it doesn\u2019t bother easing you into it, so you\u2019re going to have to really trust me when I tell you that everything about it...  Yes, literally everything...  Makes perfect sense by the end, in either an on-the-surface or metaphorical way.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot, for example, may seem like a random collection of excuses to see the cast as close to naked as Japanese TV standards will allow, what with the skin-baring Kamui uniforms, the instant stripping of anybody who\u2019s defeated in battle, and a violent clash of philosophies about whether or not clothing is necessary or evil.  As we uncover more of this bizarre world\u2019s backstory, and the plot twists begin to unravel before us, you\u2019ll find that the entire scenario is surprisingly believable, as ridiculous as it all might be.  I won\u2019t go into too much details...  Spoilers and all, you know...  But what I will do is compare it to Gurren Lagann, who\u2019s second half seemed to rely on the idea that if the world\u2019s population reaches a certain number, the moon will crash into it, despite no attempt at explaining why or how this stipulation came to be.  Kill La Kill is a lot more thorough than that, and doesn\u2019t rely on the stupidity of the audience to sell it\u2019s ideas.\\n\\n\r\nWhich doesn\u2019t explain the weird nature of Ryuko\u2019s powers.  Her weapon is an article of clothing that leaves virtually nothing to the imagination, while stealing blood from it\u2019s host and magical threads from it\u2019s defeated enemies?  Believe it or not, this isn\u2019t just some random battle outfit that was deliberately designed to be as pervy as possible...  Although that kind of thing is hardly uncommon in any medium, so I can\u2019t blame you for thinking it.  It's much more than that.  I can explain this, and the good news is that it\u2019s not a spoiler!\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, Trigger is an apple that fell from the tree of Studio Gainax.  Gainax has a long history of exploring the theme of growing up, in terms of coming of age and puberty.  The problem with that is that, if all the drills in Gurren Lagann didn\u2019t tip you off, they tend to focus on the male side of this.  What Trigger did with Kill La Kill, possibly intentionally, was infuse it with a FEMALE puberty metaphor. In the first half of the series alone, you\u2019ve got her developing her powers by making an occasional blood exchange (Getting her period), collecting fibers (Growing the pewbz) and becoming comfortable with her body.  The metaphor even goes as far as to suggest that after  losing too much blood, she can turn into an uncontrollable rage monster, and this extended metaphor about her budding sexuality only feeds into Kill La Kill\u2019s deeper metaphors. \\n\\n\r\nYes, you heard me right, there are deeper metaphors in Kill La Kill.  I\u2019ve heard a lot of reviewers say that it doesn\u2019t have any real depth, but that it's okay, because it doesn't need depth, but I respectfully disagree.  As any anime fan who prefers the original FMA series over Brotherhood will tell you, even when depth isn't necessary, it's still highly appreciated and can elevate a good show into a great show.  With Kill La Kill, you just have to know what you\u2019re looking for, and once you start to notice it, a bunch of light bulbs WILL start going off in your head as you start to piece it together.  To give you as unspoilery a taste as I can, Kill La Kill has a lot to say about the subject of conformity.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when you hear the word conformity, your mind will almost certainly give you an image of a fifties style American family...  Two parents, two children, a dog, a white picket fence, and the smiling mother doing all the chores for her smarmy bucktoothed son.  Basically, the kind of world that Pleasantville deconstructed.  But the truth is that conformity in Japan is much more involved than it ever was here.  Not only is it far more widespread, but it\u2019s still a major part of their culture to this day.  From what I\u2019ve heard from a few people I know who\u2019ve traveled there, conformity in Japan is so bad that when businessman go out for a job-related meal, everybody will order the exact same thing that their boss ordered in an attempt to impress him.  It\u2019s that bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn Kill La Kill, all you need to keep in mind is that clothing...  Specifically school uniforms, and especially the Goku uniforms...  Represent conformity to traditional values   Nudity, or even the simple act of wearing your own street clothes, represents individuality and self expression.  As proof of this, Satsuki\u2019s kamui is referred to several times as her \u2018wedding dress,\u2019 despite the fact that she is at no point in the story given anything close to a love interest.  This is because marriage is also a huge part of Japanese conformity...  It\u2019s extremely difficult to get a job if you\u2019re single, and if you\u2019re a woman, you lose a huge chunk of your individual rights the moment you say \u201cI do.\u201d  On top of this, the main villain of the series is at one point shown crucified, in an obvious reference to Christianity...  Not because she\u2019s a martyr, but because she represents morality and the very same repressive traditional values that the series is cautioning us against.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if you ignore all that, Kill La Kill is still notable for it\u2019s progressive representation of gender roles.  Not only is the fanservice split between both genders, but the male characters have little to no effect on the ambitions and arcs of the female stars.  They have no love interests to comment on them not being ladylike(Are you taking notes, Type Moon?), nor are any of them fighting or striving for somebody\u2019s affection, or being saved by a stronger male when the going gets too tough.  This is rarer than you might think, as even Sailor Moon and Misaka Mikoto need a man by their side at some point or another.  It\u2019s also not uncommon for female characters to be designed so that you\u2019ll root for them to survive rather than to succeed(Or, in video games, you wind up playing them for the sake of protecting them).  With Ryuko, you root for her for the same reasons that you root for Goku or Yusuke...  Because she\u2019s awesome, she kicks ass, and you want to see her tear down the school and put it\u2019s authority in it\u2019s place.\\n\\n\r\nEven her ultra-revealing battle outfit has some nuance to it.  In the beginning, it\u2019s an incredibly awkward and embarrassing look for her, and this hampers her ability to fight the much more convicted Satsuki.  The audience at this point will presumably have the same reaction her male onlookers have, ranging from \u2018that\u2019s hot\u2019 too \u2018that\u2019s sick and shameful.\u2019  But as she becomes more comfortable with it, a strange thing happens...  People around her gradually begin to forget about the skin she\u2019s showing, and focus on the fact that she\u2019s one of the toughest and most intimidating fighters they\u2019ve ever seen.  The eroticism also wears off for the viewer, for as Ryuko develops as a character, you\u2019ll stop seeing her Kamui as an exploitation of nubile underaged flesh, and you\u2019ll start seeing it the same way you see the outfits of heroes like Superman, Batman and Ironman...  When the costume comes on, the gloves come off, and you\u2019re excited to know that somebody\u2019s about to get their shit kicked in.  Throw in an adorable pooch and a few cautionary tales about not forgetting where you\u2019re from, and you\u2019ve got a recipe for the most unexpected masterpiece of the last few years.\\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is available from Aniplex of America.  They knew they had a bankable title on their hands, and they\u2019ve released it as such.  It was released stateside as five individual discs, ranging in price for thirty dollars per DVD to sixty dollars per Blu-ray, to eighty dollars per Blu-Ray/DVD special edition combo pack.  That\u2019s a hefty price, so if you\u2019re able to find a good deal, take it.  I personally considered it a steal when I got the whole series on DVD for eighty, but for those of you who\u2019s pockets aren\u2019t that deep, it\u2019s available for legal streaming on Netflix, Hulu, and Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve criticized certain titles in the past for having depth, but being too inaccessible to casual viewers who won\u2019t be willing or able to understand it.  With Kill La Kill, this really isn\u2019t an issue.  The depth in it enhances the story, but never holds it back.  Even if you\u2019re watching it with your brain turned off, it\u2019s still a big, loud, over-the-top action series with great production values, a lot of heart and a lot of great characters.  It succeeds at everything it tries to do, and it just gets better and better every time I watch it.  Well, the beginning is admittedly a little rocky, but it thoroughly makes up for it, offering more than enough substance for any viewer.  I give Kill La Kill a 10/10.",

            "content": "Well...  For those who have read my review of Tengen Toppa Gu etc etc, I have pretty much the same complaints  here. To sum them up: WAY OVER THE TOP.\r\nThe anime is about a transfer student, Ryuuko, and how she's trying to find her father's killer. On her disposal is the half of a scissors blade and her faithful fighting suit which was designed by her father and reveals as much skin as possible, pretty similar to what you would see in a strip club where the dancers aren't paid enough to go full nude (questionable design mr. Matoi, especially considering you plannedfor your daughter to wear this...)The suit is alive. And talks to her. And only she can hear it. It also feeds on her blood to give her power. At this point it's almost impossible not to make a period joke but I'll show restraint.  The whole school (if you can call it that, honestly there's been a max of like 2 scenes where we see a lesson) wears some short of battle suits and because of the school leader's order everyone is aiming at Ryuuko to kill her. Yeah the plot doesn't matter much, it's just an excuse to fill the episodes with over the top action, transformation scenes etc etc. The school leader, the second most important character in the series Kiryuuin Satsuki is supposedly the daughter of a cloth-making company, has a similar suit to Ryuuko's and knows who Ryuuko's father's killer is, but won't reveal it to her because... Because the script writers wanted us to be amazed by the \"sudden\" twist that Satsuki was not actually the killer (oops spoilers... but honestly you'll see it coming from  a mile away). Satsuki is as strict and always angry looking as possible which after a while becomes rather boring and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've mentioned the main lead: Ryuuko and the second most important: Satsuki, but there is actually a third main character that is somehow the audience's favourite and personally makes me want to choke puppies... Mako. She's the \"humorous\" character who basically acts all childish, is supposedly \"true to herself\"and a constant reminder to Ryuuko of what she stands for... Aka she's annoying as f\"\u00a3k. Her chibi animation doesn't help either.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that Kill la Kill actually did WORSE than Tengen Toppa is that the characters are too swallow. Except for Ryuuko who occasionally has a dillema everyone is waaaay too one-sided. Satsuki is always the strict perfetionist, Mako is always the stupid annoying f$%k . The situations and alliances might change but the characters themselves don't change at all. We're talking about class A zero-depths. Especially Satsuki, considering she's the only family Ryuuko has left (oops, spoilers again) feels waaaaaaayyyy too lakcing in the emotional part. (At that point I congratulate the doujinshi writer Ninoko for her work Yuri La Kill and the beyond brilliant idea of making Satsuki a siscon while not taking away from the strict character. In fact, why DIDN'T the writers of the show do that? It's actually pretty fitting -her remaining in the leading role and all even in family matters- and offers for some great humor without ruining the character.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rediculous, doing the same stupidity as Tengen Toppa and announcing the names of attacks/transformations with BIG BRIGHT RED LETTERS ON THE SCREEN (and more often than Tengen Toppa too) and the animation, again, looks way too manga-like for my liking. The soundtrack is easily forgettable and the voice acting while fitting doesn't exactly excite me much. At least this time there are no mechas around... Not at the start anyway...\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I was accusing Tengen Toppa for trying to be the overly-manly anime it was, aka being an anime featuring apes for apes? Well somehow Kill la Kill is also following the logic of being overly manly and apish... Despite 60% of the cast being female. Do you see the problem here? I'm not trying to be sexist but they just don't fit well. Hell, the only character that actually fit her role (of playfully diabolical all-hail-Cthulhu female) was Nui, but even she is buried underneath the current of flows and immaturity the show has. You can't go having the females act like males in THOSE kind of suits, they just don't work together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs Tengen did, the plot eventually ends to the conquering of the galaxy and a gigantic nonsensical space fight with people screaming their lungs off, with lines pretty similar to \"who do you think I am\" and going from stupid transformation to stupid transformation. In the final scene we see the three main characters going on a mall for shopping because the show suddenly decides to remind us they're girls after all. . . . Wait they are? The protagonist is so tomboish that if it wasn't for her almost-non-existant battle suit you would propably consider her a boy (also for some bizzare reason she kinda looks like Fudo Yusei... When she's not going around naked I mean), Satsuki is so strict that again, you barely consider her a woman and Mako is so annoying that you can't possibly consider her human, let alone define gender. Hell, NUI is more feminine than them and the show presents her as the terrible monster (oh yeah, she's also my favourite char in the series, which means that if I give the others a 2/10 I give her a 5/10).\\n\\n\r\nOverall stupid, immature and pretty clearly there to fullfill the fantasies the director had when he hit puberty. Trash.",

            "content": "Kill la kill was... alright.  An overall score of 4 describes it perfectly with the word \"Decent\".  Let me tell you what I mean.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story centers around a hero whose motivations don't make much sense, and whose actions make even less.  There's very thin lines between parody and seriousness with KLK.  Each episode expands the plot a little more, and it gets crazy and reaches ridiculous proportions.  Is this a parody of other shows?  Are they being serious with the random, crazy plot points?  You can't really tell, and at some points you have to look pastthe craziness and ask yourself \"What exactly is going on?\" and \"Is there a story, or are the writers just throwing plot progression haphazardly into the show for no other purpose than to create more opportunities to draw ridiculous fight scenes?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nAt some points, the art is really nice.  At other points, it's really crappy.  Once again, is KLK attempting to parody other shows, or is the budget just really tight?  Am I supposed to accept the crappy animation and dull art as comical, or should I be concerned that characters have literally begun to move around as if they are in a 2-D world?  Is it okay that some fights are just lines moving around everywhere, and that important scenes are just paintings?  I don't know, with KLK anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut, nonetheless, the art alternates rather frequently between good, okay, and really bad, and averages out to an overall \"Decent\".  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack speaks for itself.  Amazing music choices all around, amazing OST, and most of the songs are great listens outside of the show.  Voice acting?  Also amazing, the voice actors were very unique and memorable.  The voices fit the characters, they were expressive and emotional, and the voice actors do an exceptional job keeping up that level of quality throughout the show.  The sound of this show is easily the best part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters generally fall into one cliche or another.  Personalities are set early on and no many of the characters develop further than their initial setting. Let's be clear, the characters are all unique, they have good chemistry in the show, and they break most of the annoying or dealbreaking stereotypes.  The chick you'd expect to be your typical moe character is actually caustic and cynical, the ditzy character isn't tripping over her feet every seconds and blushing about her love interest, and the tomboy badass chick is actually a badass, and isn't just waltzing around beating on boys for groping her.\\n\\n\r\nSo kudos to KLK for meeting the bare minimum of good characters, but it isn't enough to move past a 5 in score.  Characters are generally one-dimensional, and character development is done swiftly and with little to no logic behind the shift.  The villains are very generic, the heroes are also very generic.  The main heroes even cover the basic spectrum of \"reasons a character wants to be the hero\", vengeance and values.  It's just too piecemeal and too uninspired to deserve anything above a mediocre ranking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is rather subjective.  Personally, I didn't find much of the show to be funny, and I didn't find much of the action to be entertaining.  To be frank,  the story wasn't nearly intriguing enough to keep me interested, the fights were either too short, had obvious solutions, or were won by something completely out of the blue, making them hard to enjoy, and the humor alternated between crude and horrible and somewhat chuckle-worthy.  To say the least, it's colorful and fast-paced, but KLK leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is... decent.  There isn't another way to describe the show.  It's crazy, when it's not frustrating it's fun, and for a couple moments it's enthralling, but other than the soundtrack, there's nothing special about it.  There's nothing that catches your attention and really shows you what makes the show so great.  It's a bumpy ride of \"How many bad parts am I going to have to sit through before another good part comes up?\"",

I was appalled and felt very much like an anime elitist. However, I had heard fine things about it, so I trudged on. A few episodes later, I was so sucked into the storyline that the nudity didn't strike me as a ploy for male fans. A few more episodes and I understood why everyone was getting undressed. I like boobs as much as the next girl, but I was glad it didn't turn into one of THOSE anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt was fast paced and intense, leaving me wanting for more after every episode I saw. I devoured them. The character development was lovely, with a few unexpected twists, but it worked out. Satsuki and Mako came to be my favorite characters by episode 14. The art in the still scenes was nicely drawn, and there was a good balance of angst and comedy to keep me interested. \\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I watched it. Would definitely recommend.",

            "content": "Kill La Kill exploded onto the anime scene in late 2013 with a fair amount of hype, considering that the creative minds behind Gurren Lagann were teaming up to write and produce another series. The hype thrusters were activated, but does the series deserve the praise it received after its conclusion? This will be a spoiler free review.\r\nThe story starts off introducing us to our main character Ryuko Matoi, a delinquent school girl packing a gigantic scissor blade looking to avenge the murder of her father. She has traveled across Japan looking for anyone who has knowledge of her father or the missing half ofher scissor blade. She soon encounters Satsuki Kiryuin the student council president of Hyonnouji Academy, a school she rules with an iron fist, and has knowledge about Ryuko's father. \\n\r\nThe real interesting point of the Kill la Kill universe is the fact that people gain super powers through the use of their uniform, rather than having them inherently themselves. This pokes fun at how in most magical girl anime, the girl gains some ridiculous uniform after gaining their powers, rather than from the uniform itself. The story of Kill la Kill moves forward at a breakneck speed, and is absolutely over the top in every way, from the fan-service to the fights. The fan-service is what will alienate most people from the show, as well as the first handful of episodes which are really hit or miss until the story really finds its footing when encounter one of the true antagonists. The fan-service is blatantly shown through the uniform that Ryuko is forced to wear in order to access her super powers, and is seen throughout most of the cast, male included. This lackadaisical approach to nudity could be a little uncomfortable to some people, but the nether regions don't have nipples or anything like that, so its in good taste for the advancement of the story. Nudity and becoming comfortable in your own skin rather than focusing on material items like clothes is a integral theme to the story. The first few episodes are a pale comparison to the epic action that takes place later on in the series as the stakes get higher and higher, One reason the first half can be a bit tedious is adjusting to one of the supporting characters, Mako, who can come off as a bit annoying at first. Her rant scenes happen a few times every episode, and while some are genuinely funny, others are a drag and just annoying. The over the top nature of the series is also tough to settle into, but the jokes are really funny as well as the sight gags, and it really starts to click as the show goes on. \\n\r\nThe only problem is that if someone saw you watching some of the more over the top scenes they may question their sanity a bit, as some of the stuff that happens is completely bonkers, but that's what makes Kill La Kill great. The series works best when firing on all cylinders to the insanely catchy soundtrack in the background, as its over the top fights are beautifully choreographed and will leave you speechless as you watch explosions that turn into implosions that explode again, or see people embrace the idea of capitalism to the fullest by shooting their enemies with money. The strengths of the show lie in the fact that is not afraid to push the boundaries that are defined as normal, and y keeping an open mind you too can enjoy the crazy ride from this Trigger production. the second half of the story is the real stand out of the series, as the stakes get higher and the fights become more intense, but unfortunately some of the humor is sacrificed for a new more serious tone.\\n\r\n Kill la Kill also features an ensemble cast of characters who are also zany and quirky in their own ways, with some of their personalities exaggerated to comical levels. The real stars of the show are Ryuko and her sailor uniform sailor uniform Senketsu, as watching them learn to compliment each other and bond as the series goes on is one of its finer points.  Mako and her family kind of get on your nerves, but sometimes they can be quite funny, and Mako despite being certifiably insane is a loyal friend and quite comfortable with herself, self identifying as a slacker, The initial antagonists of the show, Lady Satsuki and her loyal partners the elite four are initially shrouded in mystery, but are all interesting characters in their own right, and go through some development of their own as their pasts and motives are slowly revealed. Overall the series is one fun ride as you watch the heroes move from one ridiculous set piece to the next, and it was always a blast to tune in and see what zany adventures the creators had in store that week. The over the top action and gags are what sets the show above others,and it truly is a unique creation that feature some nice visuals and some great fights that go along with them, as I find myself thinking of Kill la Kill whenever I want o have some brainless fun watching some crazy fights. Sticking with Kill la Kill despite the fact that it seems a little out there was one of the best decision that I made, and I would encourage others to give the show a shot, as it truly was one of the standouts of 2014.\\n",

            "content": "Script - Some weird aliens came to earth and helped humanity to evolve because they needed a host to stay alive. Just like the plot of Chrono Trigger, but in the game people who wanted to make use of the alien power had much more complex and intriguing reasons to do so, not some megalomaniac bad guys who want to dominate the world. Yes, this plot is about bad guys using alien power to dominate the world. The protagonist is a squeaky shounen protagonist with only one purpose in mind: revenge. The antagonist that'll become an ally is the serious leader who doesn't accept weakness.The main villain is a pompous lady who wants to rule the world because YES! So prepare yourself for battles after battles and nothing else in terms of substance. The struggles are defined solely by if you lose the battle or not, if you have a uniform or not, if you dominate the world or not. Extremes, thus, leading to edginess beyond belief in a not realistic adventure where who screams the most wins the fight. Of course, as a \"parody\" it works very well. After all, you can be stupid af, but once you admit your stupidity you're automatically forgiven of any bullshit invented. The whole concept of Kill la Kill revolves around not having a fucking clue of what's happening since the plot-twists come out of nowhere! OF COURSE, you shouldn't care about because FUNNY, ahahaha, hilarious! So, unless you have no problem in endure hours of nonsensical over the top stuff happening out of nowhere 24/7, this show is by far not something pleasing at all. That's my case and if it wasn't for my damn cousin to force me through this until the very end I wouldn't have endured this. And in case it's not obvious enough, it's a story where good guys will defeat bad guys and there's a lot of sudden plot-twists taken from the ass that appear to disguise this monstrosity as whacky and unconcerned, when in reality, it is just another lazy well-animated piece of schlock. Trigger once again producing top-notch visuals and conveying NOTHING along with it.\\n\\n\r\nCinematography - Ok, the animation is very fluid but sometimes terrible, and the character design is unique regarding each character. The camera angles are very well utilized in order to expose the various side of the same thing and also depicting different scenes in a single shot. The colors are disturbing and there're times when I had no clue of what the fuck was going on due to TOO MUCH HAPPENING in a single scene. Now, if you like everything above and is ready for some really crazy visuals that do not respect its characters physiognomy or reality whatsoever, go ahead. I prefer a naturalistic approach and changing too much the scenario for the sake of making things more fun just show their commitment to everything EXCEPT what really matters to me, the poignancy. When everything is over the top insanity, I really don't give a shit about anything and Trigger studio always do that. They don't give a shit as well, they just animate and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Okay, it's not amazing. It has two tracks I remember and the rest is just reuse of the same thing over and over again, and it's not even that effective. Unless you are in the mood for some action (which I wasn't), it'll just be 'oh look, DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY again' and that song for every time the main villain appears. I really hate, hate, hate dubbers who scream and force their voices for no reason. This show is trying to win the prize of most annoying voices ever. Again, it reflects the show's mindset of being crazy for the sake of it and it wouldn't miss the opportunity of making characters scream for their lives when they don't even need to do so. Sound effects are fine.\\n\\n\r\n1234 - Ripping off Chrono Trigger. For a fan of subtlety, seeing those plot-twists pulled out of producers' anuses is painful, excruciating and not even 'too bad it's good'. The most annoying cast ever because everyone without exception speaks like a freak and fits on a stupid stereotype because YES. The best friend of the protagonist is by far the most annoying character I've seen in anime. Every time she's on the screen I feel like doing something else instead of looking at her. If you find her funny, it's ok. However, once you don't it's going to be straight torture for HOURS! 'Oh look, that thing will enter in that guy's anus, HOW FUNNY HAHAHAHAHAH!'. Nudity and fanservice because the aliens are clothes and you know, THEY HAVE TO BE QUASI-NAKED! Of course, it's not something disrespectful towards the characters and uncomfortable to some viewer, it's just FUNNY! Sailor moon transformations because parody OR rather because it's appealing to a bunch of perverted people who like hot women almost naked for their pleasure. A lazy script about good guys vs bad guys and seek for revenge leading to childish discoveries and plot-twists, even though the story ends like any of its kind, villain dies and they live happily ever after. There's an OVA showing the next events that take place afterwards, but the end reflects the same of the series. When the fun is about seeing a bunch of explosions, shallow nudity that conveys nothing and fights upon fights, the only way you can enjoy it is turning off your brain. Not my thing though, I prefer things that contain substance and are not over the top boring and predictable.\\n\\n\r\nWanna see well-designed stupidity that's also aware of its stupidity and while screaming at you 'I'M A PARODY! I'M STUPID! I'M FUN!'? Enjoy Kill la Kill, because having a story that's not shameless rip off and characters who are not braindead scarecrows is too hard for Trigger to handle. I mean, Little Witch Academia at least wasn't that offensive. The End.",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix 1 metric ton of over-the-top action, 1 gallon of ecchi, and the brilliant minds of Studio Trigger? You get none other than the psychotic joyride of Kill la Kill. From what I know about the series, this WAS a polarizing anime to begin with, but quickly turned into a smash hit.\r\nSo is Kill la Kill as good as people have said it is? Let's find out.\r\nStory: I use this term EXTREMELY lightly, but out of all the categories, the story has got to be the weakest point of the series. While it does stick with what's given inthe first few episodes(Ryuko looking for her father's killer), many of the early episode seem really awkward in terms of their individual plots.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the early episodes aren't very focused and doesn't provide much that adds to the story, such as when Ryuko faces off against the Tennis team captain. This being said, the early episodes are still a joy to watch and the story becomes more focused as the episodes progress. A word of warning though: The latter half IS a bit weird in terms of how it's executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Kill la Kill manages to have artwork that's pretty to look at, much like it's spiritual sibling: Gurren Lagann, and....unquestionably derpy at times. The artwork IS a feast for the eyes, but I've noticed there are some animation sequences that are rivaled with QUALITY animation memes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It's true that the art is a feast for the eyes, but the music of Kill la Kill is a feast for the ears. Every character I've seen in it has a character song that fits them PERFECTLY!\\n\\n\r\nJust listen to Gomen ne liko ja Irarenai(Sorry I Can't Be A Good Child). That song alone can summarize how epic the soundtrack is.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the Japanese AND English voice actors do a fantastic job as their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Every character I've seen in this series is unique. The characters are pretty 3-Dimensional considering quite a few of their backgrounds being provided. To put it simply, they take their charisma up to a 10. Even the villains are likable!!\\n\\n\r\nMy only possible complaint would be when Ryuko comes up with a way to defeat most of her opponents about 3 minutes into her fights.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I seriously consider this to be my 2nd favorite anime. Well done, Studio Trigger!\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nExtra Things:\\n\\n\r\nA few things aren't explained explicitly, such as how Senketsu is able to move in Episode 24 when he shouldn't be able to(I still don't understand it that well. If they at least gave some kind of hint on what Senketsu was beyond being a Kamui, that would eliminate some confusion).\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I found the group known as \"Nudist Beach\" to be incredibly awkward... The characters apart of it were still awesome, but the entire groups name and choice of (hardly any) attire was just plain weird...\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.25/10. WATCH THIS!!! NOW!!!",

            "content": "Being the brainchild of famed director Hiroyuki Imaishi, the first full length anime series by Imaishi's recently founded but well loved animation studio Trigger and being hailed as the possible spiritual successor to Imaishi's previous critically acclaimed work Gurren Lagann; Kill la Kill had some very big shoes to fill in right from the start. But all of this is completely irrelevant. You won't hear me talking about how anime is saved or rambling on about #BASEDTRIGGER. But what you will get from me is my honest to God opinion on Studio Trigger's Kill la Kill\r\nIt's hard to describe the overall plot without going intospoiler territory but the basic set-up that's presented at the very beginning is of 17 year old Ryuko Matoi's plight to avenge the death of her father Isshin Matoi. Ryuko seeks out and enrolls at Honnouji Academy intending to face his suspected killer Satsuki Kiryuuin who rules over the school with an iron fist. At the instruction of his father she intends to carry it out with the Scissor Blade; a weapon crafted by him and the very same weapon which led to his eventual untimely death. Satsuki then offers Ryuko a challenge. If she defeats her minions (All of which are students at Honnouji Academy) armed with the Goku uniforms and various other resources only then can she face her in one on one combat. After failing to defeat her first enemy with the scissor blade alone, Ryuko runs into a mysterious being known as Senketsu. Designed with the appearance of a sailor uniform, Senketsu is a living creature that feeds of the blood of its wearer and grants them great power in return. Armed with the the scissor blade and this new found power Ryuko Matoi intends to take down Satsuki Kiryuuin to avenge her father's death and end her rule over Honnouji Academy in the process... or at least that's what you'd expect from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nHowever ridiculous it gets Kill la Kill's plot fairly easy to follow for the most part. That isn't to say that the suffers from that fact. The way the show handles its plot is actually one of its greatest virtues. This is not a super serious work ruined by its reliance on plot twists but rather an intentionally ridiculous and over the top series that sticks to its guns by providing mind blowing entertainment for the entirety of its 24 episodes. With all the shows being produced that have no idea what they're doing and constantly switch directions like its going out of style simply because the writers aren't confident enough in their abilities Kill la Kill is nothing short of an anomaly. Not only for anime in our current time but for anime in general too. The show has some pacing issues and a handful of pointless scenes that don't quite entertain or contribute anything meaningful to the overall storyline but they're barely even worth mentioning in a show that has so much going for it\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of the show is quite large but needless to say some get more screentime than others. Fortunately the best characters tend to get the most screentime. Ryuko is a strong lead character with a likable personality and her fair share of character development. Her indecisiveness in certain scenes is a bit irritating but it's all part of the aforementioned character development so I don't mind it too much in the grand scheme of things. Although arguably the best character development in the show would be that of Satsuki. Once again it's hard to go into detail without spoilers but to summarise it I will say that I saw her in a completely different light by the end of the series than I did at the start. Mako Makanshoku acts as Ryuko's comic relief sidekick who does a fantastic job of reminding the viewer exactly how serious the show should be taken with her humourous monologues while also having some strong character development. And of course I can't go without mention Ragyou Kiryuuin and Nui Harime who are probably among the best villain characters I've seen in recent years. Nui did an especially good job of getting under my skin with her cutesy voice and nonchalant attitude while doing her evil deeds. The supporting cast is great including Mako's scumbag family, the sexy voiced Nonon, Gamagoori the manly giant with a heart of gold and the ever suave Aikurou among others.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the first full length series produced by Studio Trigger; Kill la Kill is not an expensive looking show but its stylised animation is most certainly distinctive. Even with a minuscule budget Kill la Kill still manages to pull of some truly jaw dropping action set pieces. I've seen shows with big budgets and shows that make the most of their big budgets with a lot of blood sweat and tears but Kill la Kill may be the first show I've found visually appealing solely because of the passion that the animators have for their work. Although when the entire show is fueled by passion I guess it isn't as amazing a spectacle as it should be. But while it never truly holds the show back the low budget is noticeable. Corners are cut, frames are skipped and there's the occasional static frame or cheap animation effect used here and there. But this usually occurs during dialogue scenes and thanks to the stylised animation the show even manages to get away with it for the most part. So overall, the animation in this show still comes out as a high point even if it's not as strong as other things at play in the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a massive disservice to the show if I went the entire review without mentioning the soundtrack but I doubt there's much I can say about it that hasn't already been said. But, I digress. Scored by Hiroyuki Sawano of Guilty Crown, Blue Exorcist and Attack on Titan fame the score of Kill la Kill is suitably... well, amazing. Whether it be choirs, orchestras, the standard rock band set up or a mixture of two or more the score never fails to enhance the on-screen action. And since it is a necessity when reviewing this show I will agree with the widely agreed notion that 'Before my Body is Dry' is the next step on the path to evolution.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED themes of the show are not quite as noteworthy but all of them provide a visual treat with some good music. Both OPs serve to get the viewer excited for whatever will happen in the episode while the ED seem to be made with putting the viewer at ease. But out of the two OP and ED themes I found the second to be stronger in both cases.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice work this show has some of of the best performances I've likely ever heard in anime. While she has had a number of notable roles I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Ami Koshimizu's performance as Ryuko is a career high point. I know you're all thinking something along the lines of 'What about her performance as Hibiki in Suite Precure?' Or perhaps even mentioning her performance as Holo from that obscure little show about economics and stuff (I think it was called Salt and Fox or something). But I'm serious in saying that it is most certainly a very notably good performance. Special mentions go to Aya Suzuki who is indescribably perfect as Mako, Yukari Tamura for making me want to rip Nui's head off whenever she was on screen (Don't worry, you're supposed to hate her), Romi Paku's delightfully insane performance as Ragyou, Toshihiko Seki for his performance as Senketsu and of course Ryouka Yuzuki as Satsuki. As of yet an English dub has not been made.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill la Kill is nothing short of a fun ride. If you're looking for a complex story with hard hitting mature themes you likely won't find it in Kill la Kill. But when you consider the fact that the show never intended to do anything of the sort you can't really fault it. However if balls to the wall insanity, over the top action set pieces, a grand story line with a massive scope and a great cast of characters appeals to you then by all means go ahead on watch it. But just know that under no circumstances should you ever lose your way in the process of watching the show.",

            "content": "Meet Ryuko Matoi, a high-schooler with a giant ass half of a pair of scissors who is out to take revenge for her dead father at... a highschool. To find the people responsible while fighting the Elite Four: The toughest mostly deadly group in the world with their leader, Satsuki Kiryuin the head of the school and of this city! At first Ryuko fails but with the help of her friend Mako and the secret weapon of her father, Senketsu: A talking super powered school uniform that turns into a battle stripper outfit (it happens). She'll be able to right wrongs in this chaotic worldand avenge her father.\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm sad that I lack the talent to make this shit up\" - JonTron\\n\\n\r\nLets not beat around the bushes, this is one of the silliest, most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my life and since I've seen Fooly Cooly, Panty And Stocking With Gaterbelt, Redline, Space Dandy and a good chunk of hentai, that's REALLY saying something. I shouldn't be surprised since this is from the same people who made Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking but they still managed to find a way.\\n\\n\r\nNow after reading that synopsis I wrote, you'd assume this is a sort of a parody of everything silly about anime from battle type shounen to magical girl shows and you'd be right... kinda. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like it's older brother \"Gurren Lagann\", Kill la Kill is a testosterone fueled, over the top, action anime that's more about the passion than making any sense. It's fun, funny, the music's great, and the characters are likeable and enjoyable. Ryuko is a pretty dumb but hard working girl, always fighting to protect her friends, making comebacks to her enemies and even when she does screws up and make stupid mistakes (and she does) she'll acknowledge her mistakes and comes back on top. Satsuki is a no nonsense kinda woman, she knows exactly she wants and how to get it and she kicks all kinds of ass and even when she's defeated and broken down, do any threats phase her, fuck no! and Mako... she's just delightful. She's completely unpredictable, you never know what she's going to do next, you just know that Mako will be Mako, I haven't had this much fun with a crazy random girl in anime since Edward from Cowboy Bebop, if you don't like Mako, you have no soul and you hate fun.\\n\\n\r\nand that's what this show is: fun. Sure the animation's not very good but they do a decent job cutting corners and only use the really bad animation for comedy moments because the fight scenes between Ryuko and Satsuki are very impressive (for the most part) and since Trigger's a new company without Gainax to back up their animation, I won't hold that against them \\n\\n\r\nand sure this anime and it's characters are cliche as hell but hey at least the characters embrace the stereotypes they are (unlike most anime these days) but aside from that, everything about the show is incredible enjoyable. Is it as good as Gurren Lagann? No, definitely not but even a lesser version of Gurren Lagann is still good and the show seems like a funny satire of everything stupid about anime. Well that's what it seems to be about at first but like Gurren Lagann this show also has a second half and this is where my main problem with the show occurs.\\n\\n\r\nYou see with a premise like this, it would be impossible to take a show like this completely seriously. Yes, Gurren Lagann was ridiculous too but that was more in it's execution, the actual story part itself doesn't seem TOO dumb. Read the summary I wrote on Kill la Kill and tell that doesn't sound like a comedy and at first that seems to be what Kill la Kill is but when the second part comes along, it becomes harder for me to tell if I'm suppose to take this seriously or not. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a scene where one of the Elite Four shows off his powers before he fights Ryuko and she thinks she's got him figured out (that happens alot when bad guys in anime stupidly show off their powers and explain how they work and they act surprised when the hero figures out their powers) but he's got another trick up his sleeve and ask her did she really think he was stupid enough to do that without a back up plan, that sounds like satire to me but then some of the fight scenes aren't very well animated and are drawn out, are they like that because alot of shounen animes have fight scenes that are like that or is it just a drawn out and poorly animated fight scene? Is Ragyo is the way she is because there are some many villains with a superiority complex that wanna take over the world or is she just a lame villain?\\n\\n\r\nIt's stuff like this that takes me out of the show a bit because I can't tell if I'm suppose to take this seriously in anyway or if it's just a farse. Take Panty and Stocking for example, love it or hate it, it makes no attempt to hide what it is, a parody of American cartoons like Cartoon Network/Adult Swim kinda stuff and it never strays away from that. This is the reason why Kill la Kill is my least favorite of these 3 shows because it doesn't have the freshness of Gurren Lagann nor does it have the consistency of Panty and Stocking.\\n\\n\r\nNormally these problems would ruin a show for me but because I love these characters so much and I was still enjoying myself that I guess I didn't care, I still stuck with it but I will say that if the second half was more like the first half then this show would've been an easy 9 for me. \\n\\n\r\nIt was never going to be a 10 because Kill la Kill from the get go suffer too much from what I like to call \"Younger Sibling Syndrome\". Samurai Champloo has a bit of that too but Samurai Champloo still had it's own style, feel, and atmosphere. It wasn't just Cowboy Bebop with swords, it had it's own identity. It's impossible for me to look at Kill La Kill as anything other a female version of Gurren Lagann set in high school. It just doesn't have the originality of it's older brother (and TTGL overall had better characters, too) and that is going to hurt it but if you love Gurren Lagann and you're hungry for another show like it, this should definitely feed your appetite, if you hated Gurren Lagann, I can't see how this is going to win you over.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my thoughts on the fanservice and if this show truly represents female empowerment? When it comes to talking about anime, I could care less about fanservice. When I criticize or even talk about an anime I have bigger fish to fry and I can't say much on the female empowerment stuff because I'm not a woman, so I can't speak for that, however considering that there are so many female fans of this show and cosplayers of these characters and girls who look up to these characters, I think it's safe to say that the show succeeded at what it was trying to do in that regard\\n\\n\r\nSo that's Kill la Kill. It maybe sloppy, it may not make any sense but it's heart is in the right place. Love Gurren Lagann, be sure to check this out. Just don't expect it to be the savior of anime because it's not although it is better than most modern anime (not like that's saying much)",

            "content": "Kill la Kill was enjoyable, but watching the whole series, I noticed the anime kinda started to fall apart. The first 10-ish episodes (In my opinion, of course) were the best ones, but after that it got really annoyingly confusing and sometimes cliched.\r\n  I gave the story a 3 because, like I said, it was either confusing or sometimes just plain dumb. I won't get into detail, cuz you know, spoilers. but honestly though, that's how it felt.\r\n  I gave the art a 8 because it looks nice. Nothing incredibly special, it's just a little unique, especially with the font ofthe text flying around. It's nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\n  Sound wasn't horribly awful or anything, so I gave it an 8. Maybe other people may have noticed problems, sure, but I didn't. Gonna play it safe with the 8 though.\\n\\n\r\n  Here's the part I REALLY liked about Kill la Kill. It has great characters. We can all admit that Mako Mankanshoku was probably one of the funniest or enjoyable characters in the anime. Other characters also have great personality, especially in the first couple episodes. Many characters tell jokes and respond to them in a way that makes me smirk really big, so big my face kind of hurt afterwards. Easy 10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\n  For enjoyment, Kill la Kill was a nish-5 out of 10. I liked the personality of the characters, which is why I watched till the end, but it sometimes felt like one of those \"I'd rather watch a little bit of something else\" moments. Just barely got me to stick around till the end.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, I still recommend you watch Kill la Kill. I personally may not have liked it too much, but I know some people who love it. If your skeptical of my review or you think I'm just spouting crap on my keyboard, look for another review. But in my opinion, Kill la Kill did just about enough to earn a 7 from me.",

            "content": "When you think about it, it would be insanely difficult for a new anime studio to make a successful anime series to get their company noticed. If a new anime company makes an anime, and the anime is bad, the anime company will have a hard time in making new anime for a long time. So Studio Trigger, who had a bunch of people that broke off from Studio Gianax, had a huge challenge ahead of them. But when they announced their new anime called \u201cKill la Kill\u201d, they had a heap of hype surrounding it before the first episode even started. And now theanime has ended. Did Studio Trigger succeed in making their first mainstream anime they made a success? Or did it fail completely?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I\u2019m glad to announce that Kill la Kill was a complete success!\\n\\n\r\n(THIS IS MY FIRST TIME REVIEWING AN ANIME, SO BEAR WITH ME.)\\n\r\n(ALSO, MY REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.)\\n\\n\r\n[[Story \u2013 8/10]]\\n\r\nThe story is kinda generic, but it still works. It\u2019s sort of similar to the story of Gurren Lagann: where no matter how ridiculous the story is, it just works. The story was exciting, loud and funny. The story also got bigger and bigger as time when on. Again, sort of similar to Gurren Lagann. There was some hiccups along the way. Some examples were that even though they do explain stuff, it might make you confused. Half of the time they would explain something, I would just scratch my head and go \u201cWhat?\u201d. Another problem was the ending. I thought the ending was good, but it didn\u2019t meet my expectations. Even though the ending did resolve everything, I had some questions that didn\u2019t get answered.  But ending aside, the story was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\n[[Characters \u2013 8.5/10]]\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the characters were also fantastic.\\n\r\nThe main character, Ryuko Matoi, and the main antagonist, Satsuki Kiryuin, are a rare type of character in anime: The strong female character. There is not a lot of animes that have strong main female characters. And Kill la Kill has a fair amount of strong female characters. Both Ryuko and Satsuki are fantastic characters. They might not be perfect, but they are still awesome. And then the supporting characters. The supporting characters were also fantastic. Mako might have been the Jar Jar Binks of Kill la Kill, but Mako was still funny. The Four Divas were awesome as well. (Nonon is best Diva). There was some problems with some of the characters, but I barely noticed the problems most of the time.\\n\\n\r\n[[Animation \u2013 8/10]]\\n\r\nI will admit, I am a huge Hiroyuki Imaishi fanboy. And you can see why. He created the animation for Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking, two shows I love so much. I really liked the animation of Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking, so I assumed that Kill la Kill\u2019s animation would look great. And it was\u2026most of the time. The animation reminded me so much of Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking because it looked pretty similar, just like I predicted. When the characters fighted, it looked fantastic. However, there are some problems. Sometimes, instead of animating an action, they would instead use different frames of poses to make the characters look comical and/or fast. A huge example is whenever Mako does one of her speeches. Instead of animating all the actions and poses she did, they instead just quickly showed pictures of her posing. It did look comical, but I believe it would work if it was fully animated. It also sometimes happens when the characters fight, which kinda annoys me. Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking\u2019s fight scenes didn\u2019t have this problem. But overall, the animation looks amazing. \\n\\n\r\n[[Sound \u2013 9/10]]\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, I believe this is the strongest part about Kill la Kill. (Although I think many people would disagree with me.) The Japanese voice-acting is fantastic. All the characters voices sound amazing and match their personalities. Although Mako\u2019s voice annoyed me from time to time, it still matched her perfectly. If Kill la Kill gets an English Dub, I would be kind of scared that they won\u2019t do better than the Japanese Sub. And then there is the music. The music is phenomenal.  The songs in Kill la Kill are amazing. The song \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Your Way\u201d is just perfect. And the first and second openings of the series are also amazing. Although people might disagree with me, I think the second opening\u2019s song is better. If you want your ears to be in heaven, then Kill la Kill will help you there.\\n\\n\r\n[[Enjoyment \u2013 9.5/10]]\\n\r\nI really, really enjoyed Kill la Kill. Not only did I not only get over the fanservice, I actually liked the fanservice, due to it being funny to me, which Panty and Stocking does as well. The story worked very well, the characters were larger than life, animation was brilliant, and the sound was amazing. If you want to watch an entertaining anime, Kill la Kill should be your first choice. Congratulations, Studio Trigger. I cannot wait to see what you come up with next.\\n\\n\r\n[[Final Rating \u2013 8.75/10]]",

            "content": "\u201cFear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! Contradiction is truth! These are the truths of this world! Surrender to these truths, you pigs in human clothing!\u201d\r\n\tFrom the moment I saw its original promotional art and took a gander at its original series blurb, Kill la Kill had my utmost attention. Set in Honnouji Academy, main character Ryuko Matoi stumbles upon the giant city/prison-like school, looking for information that will lead her to the killer. The only clue? The other half of her own Scissor-Blade, which worked to do the dirty deed. As she battles the forces of Honnouji's ruler, Satsuki Kiryuin, Ryuko will develop bonds,friends and grow as a character as the result of her various clashes and fights. Or, at least, that was the original concept that, more or less, made it into the first half of the series. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe second half of the show, however, provides us with a great deal of inconsistencies, plot holes and some real laziness, all while still being a pretty enjoyable experience.  So what's the big deal with Kill la Kill?  Why do I feel that the work fell apart in a lot of aspects upon its closing? (And that's really saying something, coming from the director of critically acclaimed works like FLCL, Panty & Stocking and Gurren Lagann, Hiroyuki Imaishi! Why am I able to proclaim the goodness and overall over-the-top excitement about the series, while still pointing out its missed marks? That's something that I, personally, want to explore now and explain in detail, for good or bad. \\n\\n\r\n\tIf someone sat me down and told me that I had to pick certain exact elements of this series that were a tad more problematic than the others, I would \u2013 without much or any hesitation \u2013 mention the consistent and worrying gaps in the categories of \u201cStory\u201d and \u201cCharacters\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you've ever peered at the character design and art of Kill la Kill needless to say that it's near flawless. From Ryuko's braggadocios hair and demeanor to Nonon's perfectly matched outfit to go along with her powers and personality, it all goes together in such a way that you wouldn't expect from a modern anime. However, though the design of these characters is definitely a great strength, the biggest detraction from the characters themselves is...well, the characters themselves.  While Nonon is truly beautiful from an aesthetic point of view, you will discover that she, in terms of actual character traits, can be summed up with one basic sentence, at best an elongated sentence.  \\n\\n\r\n\tThe same could easily be conjured up and explained about Mikisugi, Ryuko's flamboyant teacher, undercover for the secret Nudist Beach organization.  Or Gamagoori, Satsuki Kiryuin's proverbial and almost-literal shield. And even Tsumugu, the mo-hawked mayhem who's sister died in an experiment.  Though they all are a glam to look at, you can't help feeling that these characters are hollow shells of over-used character archetypes...which have been done, repeatedly over the years, in much better form throughout a majority of works. (And don't even get me started on Mako!)  In short, none of the characters, from most of the heroes to the villains, are memorable, other than the obligatory Ryuko, Satsuki, Issin Matoi and Senketsu.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe other aspect plaguing Kill la Kill to the point of parasitism is its balls-to-the-wall, \u201cYou're too slow!\u201d plot that continues to speed up from the middle of the second half to the end.  In some cases, this is seen in various parts of the anime community as a necessity...although it tends to be exactly the opposite. And, even if the show's story has fast pacing, we need to remember that that is not always a great thing.\\n\\n\r\n\tI'll admit, from a completely honest standpoint, that even though the first half of the series was very linear in nature and simple in concept...it worked.  It took getting through the show as a whole to realize that, but the former part of the series definitely works at what it's trying to do and establish: a simple action/comedy based world with a play-it-safe \u201cMonster of the Week\u201d formula, layered thinly with a good amount of tongue-in-cheek elements and various parody nods. This method of story-telling was typical, but it was also lucid and got the best out of Kill la Kill's potential than its latter half did. The first 12 episodes are the parts of Kill la Kill that marginally make sense, even if it doesn't make sense.  That is to say that much of the content present in the later episodes doesn't keep things easy to absorb and comprehend.  \\n\\n\r\n\tFor instance, it is stated (and assumed) that Ryuko is the only person able to don Senketsu, her talking Kamui which gives her her amazing powers, is herself.  But this is later contradicted and blanked out by later events in the series.  There are also Magic Bullets that end up being introduced and then forgotten almost immediately (a direct violation of Chekhov's Gun), a plot point that sends Ryuko on a trip that, in itself, doesn't add anything to the plot and turns up as useless, the true abilities of the Scissor-Blades being contradicted by the existence of one character, as well as the underwhelming reveal of what the Big Bads behind the series really are. (I'm not going to spoil it here, but let's just say that it sounds like something straight out of a bad indie film.  There's no foreshadowing, no indication of anything and very much no class).   \\n\\n\r\n\tI blame all of these missteps on the script writing/story making process of the entire staff, more-so the head-writer of the series, Kazuki Nakashima. In an interview about the series, he admits that With Kill la Kill, the whole staff (with myself included) submit ideas, like\u201cHey, this would be cool\u201d, and the series' layout keeps changing. It's really a live production. If anything, it's quite similar to the experience I had when I was producing weekly manga. With weekly manga, you keep developing/making things in the direction the characters are moving, so it's really fun. Kill la Kill gave me that vibe.\u201d.  The bold portion of the quote says it all: not only did Kill la Kill have a rather chaotic schedule (this is normal for manga and most anime, so I'm not surprised), but Nakashima and the crew basically came up with the story week-by-week.  And what's worse is that, how Nakashima makes it sound, it seems like any Tom, Dick and Harry had a hand in the process of the story structure.  So you have people that aren't even used to making stories contributing to the story. If it were a group of established and critically acclaimed authors and editors, I could understand \u2013 this, however, just seems like a situation where there are just too many damned cooks in the kitchen.  Now some of the fan-fiction-esque moments in the later half seem to make sense as to how they were made.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut that's not to say every element smelled of mediocrity.  There were moments that I truly appreciated, such as the further development of Satsuki and Ryuko's relationship with each other, Senketsu's amazing bonding with Ryuko and there's a great amount of symbolism in the series itself! (Although, the symbolism itself makes no sense in the overall context of it all).  So it's not like everything in this element fell to complete calamity and chaos.  It is just that, overall, the series' story is definitely not one of its strongest points and fails to hold on to an air of cohesiveness. \\n\\n\r\n\tNow, if the characters and the overall story of Kill la Kill leaves more to be desired, what does that mean for it's art/animation and the musical score of the show?  Well, you can rest knowing that these two are the strongest elements of the series, although not free of their own small blemishes and boils.  While some of the animation can seem not only stiff, but very cheap (as in character's sliding off the screen in the worst manner; I could understand if it was for comedic effect, but this happens in the most serious of moments), there are moments where it can shine gloriously. For instance: Ryuko and Satsuki's first fight was, for the most part, amazingly animated and, for lack of any words, C R A Z Y:\\n\\n\r\n\tBut then, there are parts of that same battle that look like they belong in a novice Newgrounds game and honestly make me cringe: \\n\\n\r\n\tNeedless to say, the lack of detail and attention tends to diminish the value of the moment a bit.  Even if the show and its animators may lazy around in some scenes, the lovely over-the-top action scenes (with the exception of a pretty unfulfilling \u201cField Trip\u201d arc) more than make up for it.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe musical atmosphere of the show is incredibly impressive and awe-inspiring in many aspects, shifting effortlessly from classical pieces to hard metal jams to melodic ballads that help in every moment needed.  It is bombastic when it  wants to be and feeling inducing when it can be!  However, you can feel that some tracks get overused to the point that you don't love them as much as you first did.  Before My Body is Dry gets played at least twice every episode in the later half, while the amazing, mysterious Blumenkranz apparently can get placement every time Ragyo, Satsuki Kiryuin's mother, enters.  It wallows in hype for the first instance, but when you hear it played every time she walks for the first time in an episode? The whole thing tends to get a little unfitting. Nevertheless, those scars are not much in the grand scheme of the musical aspect of the show. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhile Kill la Kill is more than a very enjoyable viewing experience, that is not to say that, on the other hand, it isn't flawed.  With various plot-holes, inconsistencies and a cast of characters that, as a majority, are just too underutilized and undeveloped, it keeps the smash-hit from feeling like a completely cohesive work.  If I could take the time to make a humble enough comparison, Kill la Kill is, to me, 2013's Sword Art Online  \u2013 and for a large number of reasons.  Both series' have a cast that is largely undeveloped as characters and tend to remain stagnant, contain a story that can be problematic at various points and repetition that can tend to get on your nerves.  One of the only real differences I could be able to point out is that, while Sword Art had a story built with much more planning involved, Kill la Kill was exactly the opposite. \\n\\n\r\n\tSo, yes, Kill la Kill is a flawed piece and shares much from the international hit S.A.O, along with enjoyment and overall hype.  But even when the show tends to \u201close it's way\u201d in several aspects, it gains its way in another.  There's definitely a question as to the replay value of the series as a whole, whether or not we will continue coming back \u2013 like Gurren Lagann or Panty & Stocking or even FLCL.  And, while that is, for sure, a question that can't be truly answered at the moment, there is no doubt in my mind that, for better or worse, Kill la Kill is a viewing experience that you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nInitial Rating: 7.5/10 (After 6 episodes).\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 8.2/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nScattered Pieces:\\n\\n\r\n>Gamagoori and Nonon, while very bland as character development goes, are amazing in terms of their look and design! A++ to Sushio, the character designer!\\n\\n\r\n>Blumenkranz is an extremely great and edgy pump-up track to use for a gym playlist! (Hint, hint!)\\n\\n\r\n>Even though we've already tackled plot inconsistencies, the Magic Bullet still irks the hell out of the dude. Sue me.\\n\\n\r\n>Have we talked about Mako and how she's the most undeveloped, irritating, non-funny, uninspired, uninteresting, poor excuse of a \u201ccharacter\u201d in this series? Or a series in any medium of entertainment?  Seriously \u2013 it seems like my hate for her increased with every episode she was in!\\n\\n\r\nI hope you liked my Kill la Kill review! Or, if you hated it...at least you took the time to read it! :) \\n\\n\r\nIf you've got some tips on what I could have done better in this review or what you liked about it, be sure to leave a comment! And, remember, \u201cTo disagree is not to disrespect!\u201d :D",

            "content": "There are times in life, very few mind you, where I have been asked the question \"Would you like to grout your bathroom floor?\" To which I always reply, \"No. No I would not\". Then, finally, as if fate was trying to prove to me grouting your bathroom floor is a good thing, the low level on the spectrum anime of kill la kill comes around, and now, I can finally sincerely want to spend 6 hours on me knees grouting my tiled floor. \r\nEverybody was so hype to see this show, much in the same way I was hyped to see Hangover 2, untilI realized that it was one of the biggest mistakes of human history. Like Reality TV or Man Buns. This, I can only assume was because the same people who made the anime Gurren Laggan also made this epilepsy inducing anime. That's not very logical to think a company who produced a one hit wonder would make another anime that would be amazing. I mean, fuck, \"Take on me\" by A-Ha is a great song. But if you told me to name one other song they did, I wouldn't have a clue. I have more knowledge about the president James Buchanan than I do about the rest of their songs. \\n\\n\r\nIt throws a shit ton of repetitive jokes to keep you away from the fact that the plot has less substance than a Donald Trump campaign.  Not only that, but literally only one of the characters(Satsuki) receives any character development, and that's being more generous than Jim Jones was with koolaid. It's characters, as well as it's goofy plot, are way over the top, like some spiraling out of control Robin Williams stand up special. Not to mention this anime is about as fan-servicy as it gets. I would never give a fuck if the hottest girl at my college caught me watching Death note, but if she were to catch me watching this garbage, I'd immediately crush all the bones in my right food out of embarrassment. This gives us anime lovers a bad name. This crap that appeals to the all the socially awkward weebos out there who crossed the line between liking anime and thinking their life was a fucking shounen. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is ridiculous, and I can't even say it's bad because it was entirely drawn like that on purpose. It would be like me saying south park can't animate for shit or draw for anything. They did it that way on purpose. Yet, it's still shittier than a New York city bathroom. Not only is the art harder to look at than a nude Rebel Wilson, they use the same animation loops over and over, which make the fights, which are hilariously over the top mentally insane renditions of combat, look repetitive and more unbelievable than Ben Carson being a neurosurgeon. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is lazy and often dull, and I honestly can't even see who this was ever meant for. The focus group must have been first time anime watchers around the age of 12, and a bunch of 15 year olds with mild Asperger's. \\n\\n\r\nI mean, these characters are throwing like galaxies and fucking battleships at each other? They're fighting in space, arguing about who has the least amount of clothes on?Like, this shit is trippier than adult swim at 2:12 am. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not deep or meaningful, despite it trying its oh-so hardest to be just that. At the end of the day, only the average plebeian could enjoy this, and they would have had to have abusive childhoods for them to take this sort of level of escape from reality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is seriously a cancer I would gladly let my left testicle receive if it meant I could spare the world from watching this shit show. Please, onegaishimasu, so not watch this show. Not only will you be killing your brain cells, you'll be encouraging others to watch it, and that's just not right. \\n",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is decent anime with good characters, lots of action and on the whole interesting because of some of its unconventional style. In short, if you like brawling action with a simple yet above-average story and fun characters, then this is for you. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe plot's strongest points are its pace and originality. In regard of pace, the story rarely wastes time on constant flash-backs and generally all parts of it link to one solid thread of a storyline. The only criticism is that in spite of its strong core, there are little to no subplots and the writers overuse plot-twists heavily. Thisranges from cliches such as \"I'm your long lost sister\" to \"Mwahaha you can't kill me because of X. Oh wait you have Y, so now you can?!\", which bring it down a bit. Apart from some of those superficial attempts to add depth the idea behind the plot is relatively new (to my knowledge) and on the whole deserves credit. So the story is good, but cannot compete with anime that invest in making something more detailed and refined.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe drawings/animation are good. In particular the sometimes overblown animations add a nice touch to the slight satirical elements that surface now and then. Another positive trait is that there is actually a solid link between most character's drawing/animation and their personality, which seems obvious but seldom is done noticeably well. In exchange however, the animators seem to love still shots with the protagonists shouting another protagonists name. The rest of the combat animation is fine, but nothing of spectacular praise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually fail to remember most of the songs/sound effects used, but on the whole they went quite well with the animation. Apart from the aforementioned shouting, the voice actors are also pretty decent in their roles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters is where this anime really shines. Starting with the fact that the main character is not a prepubescent boy that is surrounded by women, but rather a teenage girl and former delinquent. The other characters are not too stereotypical and at times quite outrageously funny through their antics. Here one can also taste the real satire when there is a rebel group called \"nudist beach\" and one accordingly sees more skin than one could ask for, with nice purple glowy stars to hide the essential spots. Fortunately, this is done in a comical environment followed by creeped out looks and remarks by the other protagonists rather than pseudo-hentai and boners. To summarise, the characters are really where it is at and while there are not any deep and thoughtful ones, they manage to shine in the various situations they are in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for the anime varied at different points. At the start it was mostly disbelief at how something so generic and fight-scene intensive could be considered good by anyone. Then as most of the character cast was introduced, it became more colourful and enriched the story greatly. Then, I realised I still had 8 episodes to go and it felt like a bit of a marathon. I became a bit very disenchanted towards the end as I had seen too many grand speeches, shouting, violence, plot twists and humour. Accordingly, I would say the anime is enjoyable, but wouldn't recommend  watching too much of it at once.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, the anime has some good foundations, but at points fails to go beyond these, which is a bit disappointing. Nevertheless, it is still better than most.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10",

Oh no, it just took out mechs and universal-grand-scaled battles. This is a very epic anime with a very epic yet cheesy plot.\r\nYou think those fan-service clothes are just for fan-service? WRONG. They're actually part of the whole plot(later on). \r\nYouthink X is dead? When Y is actually X? \\n\\n\r\nYou think what you're fighting for is right in front of your face when it's actually behind you?\\n\\n\r\nSo if you think you'd like to ride the thrill ride then go on and watch this friggin' amazin' anime, that people keeps saying it \"SAVED ANIME\". \\n\\n\r\nCritical Review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nStory-wise it's epic, yet cheesy. It actually goes well with the whole plot and theme which is why it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nArt-style is not something to be fancy of. At some points it's rather average, to one point it looks friggin' awesome. But that's the whole point of the anime. Trigger and Hiroyuki Imaishi wanted it to be something like what other animes are supposed to be...a cartoon'ish. Which all animes are, but people just blindly separate them to different genres. Which I hate. That's why this is actually top-notch art IMO.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSeiyuu/VA - Ryuuko's voice actor Ami Koshimizu, voice of Mugino Shizuri was enough to get my attention. Every seiyuu in the anime fitted well in their respective characters. Ranging from the comedic, quirky characters, to the serious, epic characters, and raging psychopaths/sociopaths.\\n\\n\r\nMusic - Composed by Hiroyuki Sawano. Sang by Eir Aoi, Miku Sawai, GARNiDELiA, and Sayonara Ponytail. Even if I just mentioned Sawano, it would've been enough to know how epic the music are.\\n\\n\r\nIt actually has one of the best if not THE BEST soundtracks in this season. \"Before my Body is Dry\", \"Blumenkranz\", \"Till I Die\", are just one of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nSFX - I didn't really pay attention to this. But it was good IIRC. It wasn't realistic at some points, and some of those were just there for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs mentioned in my profile. I kind of despise rather pessimistic characters. Everyone in this show is as optimistic as they can be. They're all just memorable characters, even the ones who just appeared once in the entire series. It's just that they're all very epic in their own unique way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDah thrill and hype ride made it all da way mates.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was too fast-paced imo. Could have have atleast a 5 - 10 min scene in the ending where...well I don't want to spoil you guys.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nI wrote this right after I watched every episode on the date of March 27th, 2014.

I am one of the people that happen to love it. \r\nfirst let's get a brief overview of the anime. It is about this alternative society where the high school of the city in question rules over everything. our main heroine comes to this city to get revenge for her fathers death looking for answers, from there it gets crazywith transforming uniforms that can talk and alien life forms you would not expect; it's over the top epic. \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many things that I liked about this anime, I personally loved the unique art style that I was presented with it is something that I had never seen before and although it is said some animation corners were cut due to budgets I think it added to the uniqueness of the art style.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters were also very fresh and hilarious making me forget that the anime is ecchi and although it has a lot of ecchi it's not that type that is for fan service the anime is genuinely serious which makes it type of ecchi that's not painful to watch. \\n\\n\r\nthe highlight of the anime for me however has to be the soundtrack never before have I heard such appropriate music that is great to listen to. if anything else just watch this to listen to the music it's that good in my opinion. Even though the story is in some parts a little wacky it all comes together in the end to give us a great.\\n\\n\r\nTrigger is a relatively new studio but their first full anime is one of my favourites and was well done and I am very looking forward to their next project which I fully intend to watch.",

            "content": "This Review Contains Spoilers.\r\nIn kill la kill the art style represents misogyny, and the plot development represents women's rights. They art style was exceptionally well done, hence misogyny is almost non existent in western culture (contrary to popular feminist belief). In congruence the plot develops exceedingly well, just as equality and women's rights have in the past 100 years, to a point where it should be considered equal before we push women's rights past the point of equality and present an unbalance in the eternal seesaw we call equality, this is what I talk about next.\r\nThe entire plot of kill la kill revolves around trainingkids for a super army to battle the \"clothes species\" that takes control of people to kill them and other humans, but it doesn't tell you that this was the point of a grueling school regime and daily oppression until the final plot twist. This is where it gets interesting, women see men as oppressing them even though the ship of equality's flag is at full mast. They just don't know it, we may call them a slut, whore, slag, piece of shit that plagues the earth, etc, but really we are strengthening their resolve for any trouble they may encounter throughout their life. Men are the heroes of the war women don't even know exists, we fight behind the lines for women's rights and they accuse us of oppressing them. Similar to how Satsuki Kiryuuin was pinned as \"harsh\".\\n\\n\r\nHence I conclude my review by saying all I just said was utter filler bullshit so it would actually let me post what I wanted to say.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 I saw tits\\n\\n\r\nWould watch again\\n\\n\r\n1 improvement is add more cats, you can never have enough cats...\\n\\n\r\nnever.\\n",

            "content": "Dirty and minimal comedy, Simple, Mindless, Hyper rapidly paced with ravaging action with a unique punk like style.\r\nThis anime is a hit or miss due to that it doesn't follow the tradition of other anime.\r\nFan service rant: \r\nThis anime has been critically riddled with complaints about its fan service. \r\n       I do agree that it does have some unnecessary fan service but it really isn't that bad compared to other anime's. This anime purposely FLAT out shows fan service. It's plot is centered around clothing and it makes a good point,  that we were all born naked. Mostanime's have fan service revealed accidentally by having a character trip over a rock or something of that nature and magically reveal everything. The men in this series are literally just as nude as the women in this series. Whats the point of nagging about fan service when both genders are on the same page? \\n\\n\r\nStory - (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou've probably have seen the \"revenge\" plot very often followed by the \"I need to grow stronger\" cliche before. The story is flat on simple and cliched BUT the major difference is, that its really hyper paced. Every episode progresses the story MASSIVELY. The pace of the battle content is excellent and does not hesitate to move forward quickly. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I was surprised it went to into psychological and sad themes . There are a lot more things behind the scenes than just fan service action. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, The main character Matoi Ryuko, fantasizes about having  family, and friends due to being abandoned and alone for so long. She wanted a normal life but was given lies on top of lies. \\n\r\nThere are many other more themes but I do not want to spoil them.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (11/10) - \\n\r\n\"simplicity is the ultimate sophistication \"\\n\r\nthe art is why I decided to try this anime. Its unique, its not following the same old animation I see in every single other anime. Its sloppy, its fun, its seems lazily done. I seem to like low budget animation because I'm tired of shinning HD animation. This may be a negative for people but I enjoy its unique engaging art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is just brilliant. Its a mix of English and German songs. It suits this anime because , of its unique in terms of animation. Its filled with rock themed guitar melodies which matches this anime's unique character styles.\\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biAV-Xq9cYM] \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nExtremely cliched. \\n\\n\r\nMatoi Ryuko is your average punk girl who fights with not only her enemies but with herself to become a better person. Her design is unique and I personally love the red and black color combo.\\n\\n\r\nMako is your poor clumsy ditsy girl who loves to eat a lot. Her family lives in poverty but they manage just fine. Pretty well actually. \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki is a well disciplined samurai female who looks down on everyone. I have seen this before but the difference is that, Satsuki does not lose her resolve and turn into a Tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nI do like Matoi Ryukos rocky attitude and Mako adds some funny comedy.\\n\r\nI sympathize with a good amount of the characters(Mako living in the slums and Ryuko growing up alone). I didn't like Satsuki in the beginning but she showed some very strong moments and eventually became a character I liked. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains are just cynical sadists with little to no reasons of why they are antagonists in the first place. They are flat out simple and do what they do for fun. To me, that's good because I really don't want to see another cliched tragic reason of why they turned into villains. Also this matches the punk like style of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nSimple hyper paced progressive action. Every episode again, progresses the main characters goal MASSIVELY. No need for dramatized arcs of training. \\n\r\nI really did not intend to binge watch this series but.... the amount of satisfying plot progression I got was overwhelming. There were a fair amount of plot twists too. I'm a sucker for action and this anime is almost PURE action.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this anime is a hit or miss. Its dirty crude simple humor. I don't see this much in anime so I enjoyed it. Its not the best but it made me have throw some chuckles and laughs here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -(8/10)\\n\r\nIf you're looking for anime's that has to have something hitting something every second, this is it. A unique style of anime in general with mindless hyper paced action. 0% romance, and it does not turn into a harem either. Perfect for satisfying your lust of action. \\n\\n\r\nWhy did this not deserve a 10/10?\\n\r\nIn a way, it does highly excel at its proclaimed genre and does not turn into a romance. But there are some repeated scenes/themes I saw coming and it isn't fun watching the character go through the same thing over and over. Also some scenes were kinda weird. I mean, Mako's dad whos like 40 spies on a 17 year old in the bath when he has a wife. Kinda ehhww. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Watched the first three episodes or so, and I felt like it was going to be an anime with a slow-moving story line. Luckily, I hung in through the slow beginning, and watched it get better over time. Its ending was ok, but I felt like that did not truly define this show. Does this anime possess over the top action? Yep. Some fan service? Yep. Memorable characters? Yep. A plot that got interesting over time? Yep. I loved the art style, totally to my tastes. It's gotits fair share of cliche Shounen elements, but those do not detract from the enjoyable quality of this show.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is an exercise in absurdity. Forget everything you heard. Don\u2019t try to analyze symbols that exist only to be cool. Kill la Kill is an anime with an absurd premise that seeks only to make things more absurd. At some point, people fight using rulebooks and shooting bills.\r\nRandomness has been a common feature of comedy. Use it too much, and it stops being random. After all, if anything can happen then nothing is surprising. Kill la Kill isn\u2019t random. Rather, it operates from a set of symbols and keeps finding ways to take them further.\r\nIn fact, it\u2019s because it has a setof symbols that it\u2019s so unique. Originality is connecting two distant things. Kill la Kill was born when the director noticed how similar \u2018fashion\u2019 and \u2018fascism\u2019 were. The whole thing relies on connecting clothing to dictators who laugh maniacally and want to dominate the world.\\n\\n\r\nIt should\u2019ve been obvious for us now. After all, uniforms are a big deal in militaries which are dictatorships. No one did it before, not like this. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s not explored very deeply. The main villain wants to take over the world mostly because it gives Ryuuko something to fight, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is absurd because it has its own style, and keeps finding ways to add more to it. That\u2019s why Nui Harime is so surprising and at the same time is so fitting. She fits with the series\u2019 obsession of clothing, but until then we haven\u2019t seen a cute fashion girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe heart of the series, though, is in the characters. For all of the pictures of Ryuuko scowling, Kill la Kill is a hilarious comedy. Good comedy comes from funny characters, not funny punchlines. By making sure every character is a joke, they manage to make every situation funny even when they\u2019re ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a difficult approach. Your characters can easily become one-note. They can become a joke or even a punchline that simply repeats itself. But the characters aren\u2019t embodiment of jokes. They are ideas pushed to the extreme. The joke of Gamagoori isn\u2019t that he screams a lot, but his ridculous devotion to discipline. Again, the show uses ideas as an inspiration point that affects everything\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of them, and so there is a lot of room for varied interaction. The ideas these characters represent constantly bounce off each other and clash. They\u2019re also pushed to the extreme in a way that makes them all close-minded. So the interaction never changes anyone. Rather, we two buffoons completely sure of themselves refusing to admit they\u2019re wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also has no filler interaction. There isn\u2019t a single line of generic dialogue. Everything the characters do and say is modified by their personality. It\u2019s not even a case of voice actors putting a lot of effort. The writing itself makes sure you can recognizee the speaker. This is why the characters feel so alive and real, even though they got blasted with missiles and don\u2019t die.\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019re not psychological portraits, of course. They\u2019re mythic, embodying some ideas with grandeur. Yet, for all its lack of realism it feels more real than most anime. That\u2019s because in real life, people react to things in ways that are uniquely them. So no matter how much you exaggerate, having this trait is the most important.\\n\\n\r\nSince the characters feel so alive, the anime actually has effective drama. It\u2019s shocking at first, but the serious moments are touching. They\u2019re also pushed to the extreme, of course. Mako\u2019s eyes become a faucet but it doesn\u2019t make them any less effective. The series establishes that these are living beings. Since they feel real, so is their drama. After all, a rock falling from the sky isn\u2019t emotionally engrossing. A living person falling is tragic. When it\u2019s someone we know, it\u2019s even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe variety and pure nonsense of this cast actually becomes an integral part of the plot later on. While the story of conformity vs. uniqueness is shallow, it uses the right symbols to bring it to life. It might be divorced from reality, but a story of a bunch of crazies fighting to keep their silly personality intact is relatable. It\u2019s easier to believe it when the people fighting for uniqueness are as unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe irony is that the only character who goes through a major change is Satsuki. She\u2019s at first a symbol of conformity and The System, later to reveal she has different intentions and then to admit her methods were wrong. I\u2019m not sure whether it was meant to shed more light on the ideas. It\u2019s a little too disconnected. Still, it\u2019s a good example of how flexible it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are also a big deal. The amount of sexual fanservice has been blown out of proportions. The art style is closer to the Western caricature than traditional anime. Characters are often blobby and in weird shapes. The women have figures, but they\u2019re mostly just there. Shots that emphasize their sexy build are rare. Many bodies are only vaguely female.\\n\\n\r\nBesides transformation sequences and a few suggestive shots, the series ignores nudity. It\u2019s there. Some people sport their abs and you can get a decent idea of Ryuko\u2019s figure but that\u2019s it. Anyone looking for hot shots to screenshot will be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about the art style is brilliant. The expressive character design is a given. It\u2019s the environment and action scenes that are more unique. Nothing is literal in this world. Every environment expresses the atmosphere, but is never meant to be taken literally.\\n\\n\r\nThis may some like a problem for those who care about precise details. If you care about precise details, read history. Fiction isn\u2019t reality but an expression of human thought. The scenery of Kill la Kill is physically impossible, but is important for the immersion. That\u2019s because humans don\u2019t take in precise details. We take in certain cues that make perceive our environment in some way.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is the same. It\u2019s rarely a case of tactics. It\u2019s cool people swinging their weapons and uniform while color flashes. It\u2019s a lot of fun but I\u2019m surprised the Porygon effect didn\u2019t surface. Besides the lump of exposition around the middle, it\u2019s the only weak spot. Sometimes it\u2019s too much, the colors flash and move and things explode and the only result is a headache. Kill la Kill is mostly good at controlling its nonsense (which is why it\u2019s so impressive). A few action scenes are the only ones where its style works against it, doing more harm than good. It\u2019s a small case.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also sometimes feel a little too long and overloaded. It\u2019s never enough to ruin it, but by the final battle the series has less steam than before. As good and epic as it is, it\u2019s not enough. The series pushed things to the edge so much that they didn\u2019t have much for the end but a huge lump of fibers.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the flaws are tiny and barely worth talking about. Kill la Kill is the essential anime about beating people up and saving the world. There\u2019s no reason to watch long shounen anime that never end when you have this. Even One Punch Man, which was a lot of fun looks tame and silly by comparison. It\u2019s a series worthy of the hype, and I hope the fandom will keep it popular for a long time.\\n\\n\r\n4.5 glorious Mako speeches out of 5",

            "content": "See, in the anime world, there are the weird series. There are the ones filled with fan service. There are the ones filled with stupid action. There are the ones with outrageous stories. And then there is Kill La Kill.\r\nAccording to the internet, ANIME HAS BEEN SAVED!!! Kill La Kill entered the anime world with a thunderous fanfare. The hype was overwhelming and deafening, even long after it had aired, resulting in this series skyrocketing in popularity. Why did it become so popular? Well, after watching it, I can say that with certainty, this series is pretty creative. At first glance.\r\nSure, we have seen outrageousstories and action and humor before! Gurren Lagann and FLCL did it years ago. But Kill La Kill takes these themes and executes them in its own original colors. Fan service isn't just fan service, it's plot! Comedic relief isn't just comedic relief, it's plot! Outrageous action isn't just popcorn entertainment, it's plot! Kill La Kill is a machine that turns cliches and tropes and converts them into new and thrilling themes that, depending on your point of view, can either be extremely entertaining or can be taken as something profound. Whether you are an anime intellect or a casual viewer, Kill La Kill has something that will satisfy your tastes. This is probably why people think anime has been saved.\\n\\n\r\nYet even so, Kill la Kill is flawed beyond belief. After a the flourishing of apparently original colors, Kill la Kill starts embracing the tropes that it is making fun of to the point where you can't tell if it's parodying the tropes, or falling into its own trap. It becomes cliche for fun yet also cliche for serious story telling. In other words, it makes fun of cliches so much that it itself becomes cliche. The pacing also gets extremely goddamn slow near the middle section of the story, and it loses its thrilling promises of an action packed show.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Entertaining as balls.\\n\r\n- Characters are pretty entertaining... at first.\\n\r\n- Explosive animation and directing, really hyping the action!\\n\r\n- Hype generating sound track as well!\\n\r\n- Fan Service with substance!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Sometimes hard to tell if serious or silly.\\n\r\n- Low budget art overall.\\n\r\n- Most characters lack development of any kind.\\n\r\n- The comedic side character, Mako, is definitely a make or break character, and I won't lie, she got on my nerves many times.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nRyuuko is on a mission to avenge her slain dad! Quite the cliche premise if you ask me, but the thing is, Kill La Kill took this in an incredibly fresh way at first. Again, the story took many cliches that us anime fans are sick of and extremified them. The story is as fast paced as the action, and the setting is as extreme as it gets! Oh, it's based in a cliche school setting? Better make the school so damn hardcore that it feels like a prison. This show moves on and on with its themes, blasting you with fresh entertainment whenever it can. While this may make the story seem extremely silly and satirical, it has points where it makes you take it seriously. The combination of both silly and serious can confuse some people however, as they don't know how to perceive the story. Is it a parody on action series? Or is it actually a profound story meant to be taken at face value? Or does all the outrageous action and fan service symbolize something? Because of how many times it switches between satire and actual plot, not only does it become hard to follow, but I started to grow disinterested in following it in the first place. The hardcore action and over the top scenarios that made the show hooking in the first place became old. The jokes became immature and stupid, and yeah. Underwhelming plot is underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art is actually fairly low budget. I mean, it is the first major work of the new studio Trigger, and the background art is fairly simple and dull. But the show redeems itself in the animation. The animation is so damn outrageous, and while it isn't particularly high quality either, it synergizes with the cheetah paced plot and action so well that it really boosted the hype and entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAnother hype generating soundtrack, the music of Kill La Kill will send shivers down your spine. The OST is incredibly diverse, ranging from epic soundtracks, to lighthearted jazz and other music during the comedic scenes. The voice acting is also very on point for the most of the characters, fitting their overall personalities very well!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nThe characters of Kill La Kill are very hit or miss, especially when dealing with the ever obnoxious Mako. Some find Mako incredibly annoying, with her comedic moments ruining some of the tense moments. I am one of those people, but her comedic relief isn't just there for the audience. Ryuuko said her self during the series that Mako's silly antics are the sole things that are keeping her level headed. Again, comedic relief is plot!\\n\r\nRyuuko is also a fairly complicated protagonist to rate. Very tomboyish and strong willed, she is almost like a male protagonist of a shounen series. However, this trope gets a twist, as she becomes a constant source of fan service and all sorts of satire. This constant change between fan service and serious protagonist makes her very hard to take seriously at times.\\n\r\nSatsuki was one of the better written characters in the show, as she was very multi dimensional. The main villain, however, was the most one dimensional bitch in the world, to the point where it was actually super boring and very hard to take seriously. And I still don't even know if I'm even supposed to take it seriously!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI came out of this series more confused than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly in your face. This may throw off some viewers, but to those who just want some wackiness, I guess this show can be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father.

            "content": "I was getting vibes of Gurren Lagann watching Kill la Kill in its 24-episode run and I mean it in a good way. Like Lagann being a homage to old-school mecha anime, Kill la Kill is an action-comedy paying homage to old-school action anime with hot-blooded young fighters, crazy attacks, a ridiculously powerful student council, overly elaborate plot twists and over-the-top villains. It also packs plenty of revealing attire and nude bodies in its focus on superpowered clothing being capable of granting its wearer superhuman attributes and unique abilities, as well as a resistance group consisting of folks who wear nothing but strategically placed militaryequipment.\\n\\n\r\nLike Gurren Lagann, the series does sport substance to it beyond being a hodge-podge of cliches to poke fun of. While the first half starts off somewhat formulaic as Ryuko's abilities with her uniform Senketsu increase and she takes on the school's student council in a gauntlet-style tournament battle, the second half of the series shifts into a somewhat more serious and grand ongoing plot when major details are revealed concerning the origins of the superpowered uniforms, who kill Ryuko's father, some shocking revelations about Ryuko's origins, some seemingly villainous major characters from the first half not being as they seem on the surface and two new major villains coming into play for the second half. While these revelations may feel like the typically too convenient or cheap plot twists you would expect from a long-running shounen battle series, the show's direction was clear and there were some hints dropped that things may not be seemingly ordinary with elements to the title's plot and characters with the typical mold it seemingly had on the surface for much of its first half. The only major issue I have with the series was that there were points where the first half to Kill la Kill dragged in terms of developing its plot since it was fixated to a good extent on milking action anime cliches.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series milks use of subdued color tones and a drawing style for scenery and character designs almost like the work done by Gainax. The animation makes use of a number of standard techniques and shortcuts employed for 90s action anime, while mixing in its own unique spins to such tactics such as Nui's limited movements and cheap-like animation for much of her battles. The choices for Kill la Kill's animation are a great fit to compliment the title's over-the-top and manic action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill la Kill was a fun run for 24 episodes with its manic comedy, over the top action and elements to older action anime being a nice combination for an action-comedy title. If you enjoyed Gurren Lagann, you're likely to get similar enjoyment out of this series.",

            "content": "Kill la kill. Essentially an entire story based around clothing or the lack thereof. At first glance this sounds like a horrible plot to some crappy ecchi story you find in the back room of your local movie rental place. But the fact that Kill la Kill has this premise and yet rises above and beyond the stereotype is something to be admired.\r\nStory- 9/10 - As noted, this story follows Ryuuko Matoi and her journey of revenge, with clothing that allows people to have special powers. The action aspect of this series is non-stop, fighting scenes with blood gushing from severed limbs like old faithfulhappen at least once every episode or two. To counter act this blood bath is an immature but surprisingly funny comedy aspect that interjects in the story at the most random and hilarious times. However, with all of these themes we still haven't looked at the most amazing part of this story. Kill la kill is an over the top-ecchi-violent-comedy that manages to be \"tastefully distasteful.\" The story has deep moments of friendship, family, and overcoming adversity that truly gets the audience to dig deep into the meaning. Literally the only personal problem I had with the story is the ecchi element, but that is just a personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - 9/10 - I hate to be one of those reviewers that gives every aspect of a show a high rating just because I liked it, but kill la kill is just this deserving. The artwork in this series is unique because it is very modern, but still gives tribute to classic anime styling. The CG elements weren't too obvious and the deep contrasts of coloring and scene styles allowed a very pleasant visual experience. The sound of this series was very unique as well. With emotion inciting background music for battle scenes, to great ops and endings, I thought the sound was very appropriate and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10 - Kill la Kill has everything a story needs for good characters. A lead protagonist that goes through an amazing amount of development and struggles. Villains that are so good at being sinister you can't decide to cheer for them or against them. Supporting characters that make you laugh and make you cry. Truly if nothing else is to be understood about Kill la Kill know this, you won't find a cast of characters this complementary but once every decade.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10 - Kill la Kill should just be commended on how incredible it was for the writers to create such a great story with such a dumb plot idea. I haven't been this blown away since I first saw the movie \"fight club.\" Regardless of your personal tastes I think kill la kill has something for everyone, an enjoyable high octane plot with lovable (and delightfully detestable) characters. I wouldn't recommend this for younger viewers, but for anyone else who has the slightest inkling to watch this, I promise you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! - @animaniablog",

            "content": "My review is entitled the top 5 criticisms of Kill La Kill and why I disagree or do not care.  I guess this really is not in tune with the guidelines but what\u2019s the point of reviewing if you can\u2019t address the issues that everyone has on their mind?\r\n1.\tMako is so annoying.\r\nThe number one criticism is that Mako, the stupid best-friend character, shows up at inopportune times\u2014usually in the middle of a hot action scene\u2014and this ruins the mood.  I think that\u2019s the whole point. That\u2019s not to say that the fact something is on purpose makes it a good idea but itworks here. Mako\u2019s appearances remind the viewers that the show is just not that serious and that we can always expect the absurd to occur.  It\u2019s even beyond just establishing the expectation of absurdity but absurdity surrounding themes of what I would call \u201cplain values\u201d. By that, I mean simple, idealistic notions like friendship, having a nice outfit, or eating a comforting home cooked meal.  I believe the point of the anime, and the creator\u2019s views of anime itself, is to give the viewers a vehicle to feel these simple but gratifying emotions.  In the real world, we just can\u2019t get there because things aren\u2019t as ideal as they are in the world of anime; so heroes like Ryoko break all the boundaries of logic in the animated world to achieve a state of affairs where these feelings can exist.  Mako\u2019s appearances remind us what we\u2019re fighting for, that this fight is illogical and that this anime will destroy that logic for us.\\n\r\n2.\tIt\u2019s just a rip off of TTGE\\n\r\nI will admit that this series shares both style and sentiment with Gurren Lagan.  My question is, why does Gurren Lagan have to be a one off?  Why can\u2019t Gurren Lagan be a genre? The plot itself was different enough that I was interested in what was going to happen.  I felt the same emotions I felt watching Gurren Lagan but I didn\u2019t feel like I was watching TTGE all over again.  A popular anime turns into a genre about every other year these days.  Look how many trapped in a virtual world shows came out in the last few years.  Exorcism shows are another example. I could keep going.  Give me TTGE type shows at the same rate I see stories about four high school girls having fun together!\\n\r\n3.\tThe animation looks bad\\n\r\nI agree that the whole thing didn\u2019t always look high budget but I didn\u2019t care because I found that the style was enough for me as I went through.  There was lot of flash animation style stuff or still images with moving lines in the background but the character designs were always cool and colorful.  Also, keep in mind that this is an 80\u2019s throwback type show and purists don\u2019t hate on those old shows despite how much they use stock footage etc. \\n\r\n4.\tIt objectifies women\\n\r\nI won\u2019t argue with that but there are many progressive aspects of the show.  It has three female main characters who act on their own accord to save the world. None of them are acting to save a man or for some other conservative, traditional, stay-in-the-kitchen type goal as far as I can see.  Here, the female characters are acting like shonen heroes with the only string attached being them wearing sexy outfits and having NSFW transformation sequences.  My view is that having mentally strong female characters is a more important concern than whether or not there\u2019s a lot of skin on screen. \\n\r\n5.\tIt was too long/should have been 13 episodes\\n\r\nOne of the less profound but more awesome things I liked about the show was the fact that the four devas kept getting new costumes and that the suits kept evolving.  I feel like we couldn\u2019t get all that cool stuff if we hadn\u2019t had some of the sillier episodes at the beginning.  I think the increased number of episodes also helped build up some of the mysteries like the origin of the scissor, Satsuki\u2019s origin and the main plot.  Also, to digress a little, the main plot is awesome. I won\u2019t spoil it but it\u2019s ridiculous, creative and allows us to explore themes that we just couldn\u2019t do in these serious shmerious shows.  I think it\u2019s important to have absurdist shows like this because you can\u2019t experiment with these types of plots in works where the creators are constantly worried that they will break the viewer\u2019s suspension of disbelief.  \\n\r\nSo yeah, people have already said all the good things I want to say about this series in other reviews (maybe not all the good things) but that\u2019s my two cents on some of the criticisms. \\n",

            "content": "I usually never write reviews, but this anime did so many things right that I feel I kind of have to. \r\nYou just have to get past the sometimes wacky and cartoonish animation style and the infinite amount of fanservice and eventually see that the series is so much more than that. \r\nAfter seeing the first couple of episodes I was kind of unsure still and didn't quite know what was going on. I was trying to decide whether I like it or not, but from ep 11 onwards I knew I was hooked and from ep 18 till the end it was one crazy,action-packed trip that I wished to never end. \\n\\n\r\nKlK takes its laughable plot, crazy characters, infinite boobs and butts and kick-ass action and rolls it all into a solid, fun and enjoyable watching experience. The story sounds just ridiculous if you try to explain it to someone else, and the battle outfits probably make one roll their eyes, but you have to get sucked into the whole thing and you'll find that in the end you don't even pay attention to it anymore but just want to see how it'll all end. Now, this is something that KlK did just right: it took all the cliches and all the fanservice and managed to make it work without boring the viewer and without being too ridiculous. Or should I say, it's all just so over the top and crazy that it actually works.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are likable. (Yes, I'm one of the Mako fans, although I usually hate that type.) The villains are awesome & nasty. The music is absolutely fitting for each scene and makes your adrenaline flow. The humor is crazy, as well as the action. Everything works. I have to admit the show starts off a little slow but dear god, don't drop this because of that. I think this series deserves a solid 9.",

But when I saw some reviews of Kill la Kill, I can't help but to leave my opinion of this show.\r\nWell, when begin watching Kill la Kill, I had some bad expectations. But, as I was watching the Episodes, I found it an anime I had a \"long no see\".\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAs I said, the story isn't the strong point in Kill la Kill. It has that repetitive revenge plot we all have seen in anime these days.\r\nWith a cliche story, but surprising sometimes, Kill la Kill turned out to bea genius parody. Today, anime just have focus on high school girls, horrible stories and huge, VERY huge fanservice. At first glance, Kill la Kill looks like one of those. But when you watch it, you see you were wrong. They had all these overused tropes in recent anime in the story, but in a funny and brilliant way. All the elements were there for they own purpose.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Kill la Kill it's good in its on way. I personally liked it very much. For me, it looked like the art of a 90's anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Kill la Kill is very good, but unfortunately very repetitive. Some interesting eletronics are in the series too. The strong point here its the first OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not very developed, the characters in this anime are all so idiot, and that makes them so damn funny. The most developed is the protagonist, Matoi Ryuuko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my sincere opinion, this is the strongest point in Kill la Kill. It's funny, lively, and very refreshing. The characters are funny, the fights very exagerated, mass destruction almost every episode end the provocative clothing for no reason (the most aparent critic of exagerated fan-service) makes Kill la Kill unique and very pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I don't have much more about to say about Kill la Kill, but the series is great. If I had to define it in one word it will be: \"SURPRISING\".\\n\r\nIt really teached me not to judge a book for it's cover.\\n\r\nIt's really worth it. For those who are still thinking if they should be watch the show or not, I say: Give it a shot, you got nothing to lose by checking it out. you may surprise yourself as well ;)",

            "content": "[REVIEWER'S NOTE] This is based on my opinion. While most of you probably wont give it as high of a score as I've given it, I urge you to read the entire thing before clicking the \"Not Helpful\" button. Who knows, I might make some good points.\r\nOver the years, I've noticed that there have been multiple anime that get hyped over in extreme amounts, where I'll constantly be hearing stuff like \"Holy crap dude, you gotta watch this\" or \"I started watching [insert anime here] and it's so good\". Some perfect examples of this would be Sword Art Online or Attack on Titan. Granted, inmy personal opinion, I found both of those anime exciting and enjoyable, but still, they were overhyped. It's been a looooong time since I've watched an anime that deserves the hype it gets (the last time being Clannad After Story), and now I've finally found one that I found exciting and enjoyable, while agreeing that it indeed deserves the hype it's gotten. Laties and Gentlemen, an anime that defies logic and sends you on a one way journey to crazy-in-your-face-skimpy-outfits-and-epic-fights-ville, Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching Kill la Kill, I saw no story. Yes, the idea was given to you that there might be a plotline that will eventually start up, but it started off with a kind of \"boss of the month\" feeling. Each episode would have the protagonist fight some of the antagonist's goons and gain new abilities along the way. After about 6 or 7 episodes of this, it started getting interesting (not that it wasn't already). The mystery behind one of the key plots in the story was solved, and the story just went on from there, leading to a bunch of action, betrayal, and \"hooooolllyyy crap I didn't see that one coming\" moments. Admittedly, it took me a while to fully understand what I was watching, but once you sit down to think about it, as absurd as it might sound, the story was indeed well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that threw me off the most when watching the first episode was the animation style. It had a mixture of older animation, expression and character designs you might find in an anime such as Panty and Stocking or Chi's Sweet Home, and fanservice galore. Whle it took me a while to get used to the... unusual... art style, it grew on me eventually, and the action scenes made me absolutely fawn over it. Yes, it usually throws off most people I've shown this anime to, but it's really quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nI am honestly surprised how fast America jumped on the opportunity to dub Kill la Kill. While it hasn't yet been released, we get to watch the subbed version... which was magnificent. There were quite a few voice actors I recognized. It took me at least 13 episodes and a bunch of \"The Thinker\" posing to figure out that it was the same voice actor who voiced Holo that voiced Ryuuko. Overall, the sub was well done, and the SFX were realistic and very high quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. Good lord, there are some weeeeird characters in Kill la Kill, as well as some really badass ones. Almost all the characters had a well thought out backstory, as well as traits that made me like all of them... well, almost all of them. I can say that Kazuki Nakashima was indeed excellent in making protagonists, as well as antagonists. In fact, he did so well of a job that I absolutely hated the antagonists with every life fiber in my body. It might sound weird saying this, but I'm hoping that he makes the villains of his next series less hate-able. And then there's Mako...\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill was a kick ass awesome anime. It paced itself out nicely, had excellent action, great character development, wonderful voice actors, lovable protagonists, hate-able antagonists, a decent story, and a whole lot of enjoyment. If you like any of the things I've mentioned, I urge you to give it a try.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is a television series directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi (Key Animator in NGE, Director of Gurren Lagann and Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt) and produced by the fairly new studio Trigger (Little Witch Academia). It first aired in October 2013, and it tells the story of Ryuko Matoi, a vagrant schoolgirl, searching for her father\u2019s killer, who, after searching far and wide, has led her to Honnouji Academy, where the strict student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin rules harshly under the regime of her mother\u2019s fashion empire. This is Triggers first attempt at an original television anime project, and so, the plot vastly differsfrom many anime already out there, making it stand out as (in my opinion, one of the \u2018must watch\u2019 anime of 2013-2014.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on with the plot. Overall, I give it an 8/10. I will be honest, there was some point in the middle where I began to think that it was getting sort of dull and dragging on quite a bit, but then, because it picked up the pace, it quickly brought me, and I\u2019m sure a lot of viewers aswell, back on track to enjoy this show. However, I\u2019d rather rate it on the actual hard work of the writer and director, and not just my experience of it. As mentioned above it\u2019s a very unique story, I\u2019ve never ever read or seen anything like it, and so because of that it gets a 10/10. It\u2019s refreshing to see some new work by a relatively new studio every once in a while, that shakes the whole industry up as much as this did, there is no doubt in my mind that it is here to stay, as I\u2019m sure that the hype that built up towards the last episode, will not die down for a while, with that said, I don\u2019t want to see a continuation of the series, as it ended very well, no cliffhanger, but what would be nice would be for some OVA\u2019s to be released, I guess to sort of quell the greed of the fan base, but then again, it might just disappoint, so let\u2019s leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art; I give it a 7/10, because unlike the plot, there hasn\u2019t been much change in the way characters are designed, or how backgrounds are drawn, and the fight scenes, however exciting they may be for me, are pretty run-of-the-mill. What is new however, is the way the characters \u2018power-up\u2019 so to say, the whole series focuses on a mysterious alien life-form called the \u201cLife Fiber\u201d. Honnouji Academy is a school that houses many students, and also many clubs. The members of the clubs receive uniforms, known as \u201cGoku Uniforms\u201d that give them strength and abilities that vary in relation to the percentage of life fibers they contain, these are available in 1 star, 2 star, and 3 star variations, the latter of which is given to only the elite members of the Academy. The way the attacks are animated is very well done though, as many members of the school have different fighting styles, and so the fighting scenes all vary, giving you a \u2018unique\u2019 experience every episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow, comes music, there\u2019s honestly not much to say about this, as sadly, it rarely makes an appearance outside of battle, often being drowned out by the adrenaline rush provoked by the conflicts themselves, but I\u2019ll give it a 7/10. It does the job, it\u2019s been very well chosen, and matches the scenes very well, but it isn\u2019t as pronounced as it should be, but it shouldn\u2019t deter you from watching, as it isn\u2019t about the music, but it\u2019s about the experience, which I will talk about later\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, character development. This is honestly, one of the best qualities of this show, and because of this is will give it a 9/10 (for reasons I will explain later). Kill la Kill follows the story of a teenage young girl, with the typical teenage girl attitude, however, throughout the story Ryuko meets many interesting characters from all walks of life, and so develops very well throughout the story, and trying not to divulge too much, she\u2019s changed a lot through the entirety of the series, as well as her friends Mako and Senketsu (her Goku Uniform). But I don\u2019t give it a 10/10 because the majority of the development concentrates around her and her uniform, which, however much I may enjoy, others may not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, without taking my opinion into account I give Kill la Kill an 8.7/10. I thoroughly enjoyed the show beyond belief, and was kept at the edge of my chair about 3 times every episode. This was a series I looked forward to watching every Thursday/Friday without fail, and would often stay up at night to catch the release. I cannot hope to express my true feeling for the show through writing, but I only hope that whoever watches it feels the same, and loves the series just as much as I do.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so any criticism (on my review not the series) would be greatly appreciated ^_^",

This was neither and did nothing for me, all hype.\r\nBack to the hipster statement. True, kill la kill has retro art and retro fight scenes, but the people praising this anime are the people who want to be \"that guy\" who's into retro fight scenes. It is NO Gurren Lagaan, so stop. You may say I don't get it and I'm full of itthis anime has everything, retro art and fight scenes, satire, action, comedy, sound, and whatever! But just because it has everything doesn't mean it's well done. I dropped it half way through just wasn't getting any enjoyment from any of its aspects.\\n\\n\r\nOh and that \"accept your body\" message that makes it so great?

No, but if you don't care about no story, art, or characters, then you can still have some good time with all the girls in this show, and that's what the show is: is girls! Let me tell you about this crazy show.\r\nI wont spoil past the first episode: the story centers on a girlfried who looks like a boyfriend who wants revenge on the person who killed her father in February of last year. It is noconfidential that this show has potential, but this is about as far as the story can going! Any twist you might be excepting from a show like Gurren Lagann doesn't happen because the show focuses on fun and not the stories! This show is funny, let me tell you!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the funniest aspects because it becomes badly drawn on purpose, then goodly drawn during the action, which happens in pretty much every episode! It happens like they meet a crazy bad guy and fight them every episode, very form you lakes design! Of course it could just be an excuse to save budget!\\n\\n\r\nThe music has vocals and is good and the voice action is over the mountains crazy in hot blooded with tired old female powerment themes. Things get so empowered that these strong scrawny women become naked! This is not a cartoon for kids, in spine of cartoons being for kids of all ages at all times! For an example the organization in the show is called Nude Beach, and even though nobody wants to see men get naked, they're naked all the time too! Ive never seen myself naked and now I have to see other men!? Agendas in this show can be distracting!\\n\\n\r\nI can't think of anything else to say but to watch this show for a good time. The story is bad, the characters don't do good, the feminism is annoyed, the art is bad and good, but it's fun!\\n",

The over the top (but not serious) ecchi/nudity is treated like a joke and not taking the enjoyment of this series.\r\nReally liked the characters especially Mankanshoku Mako. There wasn't any character that i didn't liked which is not a very good sign for a story-telling.\r\nThe cast list is good (kudos to the best new comer, Suzaki Aya), and nice to know that Koshimizu Ami voiced a main heroine role and arare villain role for Park Romi. \\n\r\nBut the one that made this Anime lively is the music, really loved 'Before my body is dry'. The insert song is filled with passion, the main reason i can finish watching this series despite the very poor plot. \\n\\n\r\nNow about the negative point, the plot, the plot is EXTREMELY WEAK. If you compare with anime like K-Kings, this kind of story are meant for children/ preteen who loved brainless anime and watch in order to see explosion and henshin-scene.\\n\r\nThe storyline can be weird sometimes, for example when Ryuuko clashed with Satsuki, the leader, and the results looks tied, yet Ryuuko has to climb all over again in order to fight Satsuki. I wasn't surprised by the story and the plot twist was predictable from the very beginning. To think that this anime came from the maker of Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, for me Kill la Kill is just another BAM- KABOOM action Anime with a different taste. The characters and sound is the consolation for the story.",

            "content": "When Kill la Kill was first announced, I was incredibly ecstatic along with many other fans of Trigger (when I say Trigger, I mean the people who formed the group even back when they were in Gainax). I was in love with Gurren Lagann, Little Witch Academia, and Panty and Stocking! So hearing about a new anime got me incredibly hyped. This was going to be a kickass anime with great characters and a cool story!!!\r\n...or so I thought.\r\nKill la Kill is by far one of the most disappointing anime I've watched so far. By disappointing, I mean I expected a lot from it anddidn't get much in return. Other anime like this were Red Data Girl and Sword Art Online. Here, this anime got SO much hype and gained quite a lot of popularity (just look at the pixiv rankings) and I hardly think it deserves what it's getting. Let me get started with my review.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, there WILL be spoilers. DO NOT read this if you want to avoid spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWe start off with a transfer student named Ryuko Matoi who goes to Honnouji Academy, determined to find who killed her father by finding the other half of her scissor sword. She's a feisty and strong female character, which is kind of hard to find in anime with all of the moe flying all around. Honnouji Academy is different that most academies in that it lets higher ranked students were super powered uniforms called Goku uniforms. Ryuko stumbles upon and ends up wearing a special kind of uniform named Senketsu who claims to know her father (yes...the uniform can communicate with her). With Senketsu and her friends, Ryuko journeys to find her father's killer.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, that was a bit harder to summarize that I thought...anyway, time to critique the story. Well, it's definitely Trigger material. Outright crazy and over the top. You later learn on that the world is about to be taken over by aliens who take form of clothing and Ryuko's mom, Ragyo, is trying to finish the process of the world being taken over by said alien clothing. The story is definitely interesting and it's something I wouldn't have expected. However, some plot points were pretty easy to predict, such as Satsuki (Ryuko's sister) who pretended to fight against Ryuko but was ultimately planning to stop her mom. Parts of the story also incredibly forced, such as Senketsu's death, Gamagori's \"death\", or the random incest molestation...Ragyo: Best Mom in the World.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, what I'm trying to point out is that compared to the pacing in Trigger's other works, Kill la Kill is definitely lacking in that department. The tone of the story keeps on switching back and forth like a bipolar teenager. One minute we have a kickass scene and then the next Mako, Ryuko's friend, is doing her weird little speech things (trying to be funny...but failing). After a while, I lost interest in being emotionally invested in the story because of the terrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nFreaking awesome. What do you expect? It's Trigger! They have amazing animation and the art style is very akin to Gurren Lagann (which I love). I just wish they had those cool before and after commercial break pictures just like Gurren Lagann did. Fight scenes are beautifully executed (once again, it's Trigger) and character designs are really REALLY cool. Oh, and expect A LOT of fanservice from Kill la Kill's art. There will also be random nudity (or just a whole bunch of it like in the latter half of the show). But in general, the art is great. It's one of the few things that kept me watching this all of the way to the end (along with wanting to support Trigger).\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEh...it's not the most amazing soundtrack. The first opening and ending were quite mediocre for me. The first opening, \"Sirius\", was a bit generic sounding and the animation that came with it wasn't astounding (which surprised me since Trigger is great at openings). The first ending \"Gomen ne, Iiko ja Irarenai\", is also a bit...meh. The animation for that is also pretty boring. This takes a better turn from episodes 16 onwards. The second opening, \"ambiguous\", has so much more energy and fits the feeling that Trigger was trying to create for Kill la Kill. The second ending, \"Shin Sekai K\u014dky\u014dgaku\", is incredibly adorable and fun to listen to! For the OST, I was quite disappointed. From the great music of Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking (Teddyloid is amazing), I could only remember 2 songs: \"Before my body is dry\" and \"Blumenkranz\". Both songs are awesome, but they were the only ones I remembered...while I could easily recall Gurren Lagann and Panty and Stocking's OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nUuuugghhhh....this is where Kill la Kill really fails to meet the hype that it kept up. Let me sum up the characters very quickly for you: flat with hardly any development. Many of them are there to kind of force relationships between characters or to push on the story. I can't name even half of the main cast. Satsuki is quite honestly the most well developed character but even she can't compare to other Trigger characters. Ryuko started off as a badass...but then hardly changed as the story progressed. I liken her to Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach, who just like her, keeps on getting stronger but not developing at all. I honestly expected her to be an amazing main character who would become stronger both physically and mentally...but Trigger didn't deliver well there. Mako is the comedic relief who means well but is like Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars - SHE'S NOT THAT FUNNY. I found her friendship with Ryuko kind of touching, but overall forced and not natural. Many other characters would be interesting but hardly got any attention. I wish there could have been more focus on the student council. They were really awesome characters but were usually on the sidelines. \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say. The characters are like ones from a children's story book - just the bare bones.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite how much I'm criticizing Kill la Kill, the entertainment value is quite high. With all of these crazy visuals and great voice acting, you certainly won't be bored watching this. Ryuko and Satsuki's first fight is under my list of my most favorite anime fight scenes ever. It was funny to see the running gags, such as the pink glowing nipples, the random nudity, or Mako's quirky family. If you want to be entertained with over the top action and fanservice, go ahead and watch it! Just don't expect much else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is average. The really great stuff, such as the art and enjoyment, are easily weighed down by the downfalls, like the story and characters. The ending of the show was fitting for Kill la Kill, but I honestly was yearning for more out of it. It didn't make my mind explode like Gurren Lagann but it was alright. If you're looking for an anime that is eye candy and nothing else, you should watch it. I've done with before with High School of the Dead. This anime is incredibly entertaining but definitely lacks in great story telling. I would easily recommend Kill la Kill to action and fanservice lovers.\\n",

            "content": "\"Fear is freedom. Control is Liberty. Contradiction is truth! That is the reality of this world! Listen well, you pigs in clothing, and submit to that reality!\u201d To say that Kill la Kill is an incomprehensible anime, would be an understatement. However, despite it\u2019s insanity, Kill la Kill stands as one of the better anime in recent years.\r\nOur story begins with the appearance of a, would be, bad ass transfer student: Matoi Ry\u016bko. Who has traveled all over searching for her father\u2019s killer, the only evidence she carries is half of a giant pair of scissors. This search led her to Honnouji Academy where shecomes face to face with the student council president, Kiry\u016bin Satsuki. Ryuko challenges her to a fight only to get the hell beat out of her by the boxing club president. She then returns to her father\u2019s burned down mansion where she is assaulted and forced to wear a unique and outrageously powerful article of clothing called a kamui that Ryuko promptly names Senketsu. Together Ryuko and Senketsu decide to take down Satsuki and all of her followers at Honnouji Academy. All of this happens in the first ten minutes of episode one.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is an anime that moves at hyper speed without any plans of ever slowing down. To me, that is one of it\u2019s best attributes. You\u2019re never bogged down by lengthy plot lines where everything is moving at a snails pace. The story is good, but quite a jumbled mess until around the second half when an actual antagonist is introduced. But the story isn\u2019t what makes Kill la Kill so grand. In fact, no single element is what makes Kill la Kill great, it\u2019s a combination of all it\u2019s elements.\\n\\n\r\nOne of those great elements being the characters. From the never calm Mako to the homeroom teacher who is constantly removing his clothes. All of them are great in their own way. But the most surprising aspect is their interactions. Take a character like Mankanshoku Mako, who is not intelligent, never serious, and comes off as a simple comic relief character most of the time. Despite that some of her interactions with Ryuko are so emotionally gripping it feels like it\u2019s part of a different show. I remember one moment in particular when the Mankanshoku family started climbing the ladder of social status, and in the end Mako and Ryuko had a fight with one of the most touching \u201creunions\u201d I\u2019ve seen in a show like this. The ability for this show, that never takes itself seriously, to be so moving is a merit all on it\u2019s own.\\n\\n\r\nOn the art and animation side of things Trigger is very unique. Much like SHAFT shows where you might have to spend time getting used to it. Nothing in the show looks particularly gorgeous, but none of it looks bad either. I will say the action sequences are particularly well animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was composed by Sawano Hiroyuki, who is also known for his work composing the soundtrack of Guilty Crown and more recently Attack on Titan. This soundtrack joins my must buy list.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill has garnered a lot of controversy usually in regards to fan service. While I suppose this show does have quite a large amount, the way it ties into the story makes it different in my opinion. These characters are not shown nude or scantily clad in an attempt to make them sexy. When shows like Recently My Sister is Unusual are airing, I find it silly to complain about a show like Kill la Kill in regards to fan service.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill la Kill is a fantastic show with a solid spot on my list of recommended anime. The entire show is available over on Crunchyroll and Hulu.",

            "content": "An absurdly obnoxious series full of fun, awkwardness, and a surprisingly interesting and captivating story with a cast of characters that you just can't help but to love. Something the anime industry has been in dire need of as of late. That to me is what Kill La Kill represents. It was one of the most fun series I had the pleasure of watching in a long time. Here are my thoughts in a spoiler free review.\r\nStory\r\nAt first glance Kill La Kill starts off with a typical revenge story, and while this theme may be overused, Kill La Kill keeps you interested with its INYOUR FACE world and characters. Every episode is jam packed to the brim with both action and comedy, oh and I cant forget of course, nudity. This is more than enough to keep one's attention however, after around the halfway point, (at which time most viewers will have developed a feel for the whacky world) the story takes a very surprising and unexpected twist. This leads the series down the right path. While a slight more serious tone is added, there is still no absence of the comedy that was present in the first half. A few more twists and turns and a couple of massive fights later, we then end up with a totally epic ending that embodies what the show is all about.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nAn explosion of color, all up in your face, is how I see Kill La Kill's animation style. Bright colors and smooth transitions are used all throughout. It is a very playful style that is only fitting for this type of series. The action scenes are wonderfully animated and you don't have to strain your eyes to see just what the hell is going on. This was very surprising to me, considering the amount of ultra bright colors and textures used. Characters are drawn out very well, and they embody the playful style of the art. One complaint I do have is that the transformation scene was WAY overused. Seeing it happen about 3-5 times an episode is way too much. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nOne of the better and most fitting soundtracks I have heard for an anime. Sounds range from fast paced rock and electro to traditional band concertos and even Mozart! The music always adds that little extra kick throughout the show to make it just that more epic. I found that some of the songs did feel a little played out by the end but it was not too big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show what it is. I wont talk about each individually. However there is a wide spectrum ranging from bright, funny, to a few serious characters. With the exception of a few almost every character has moments that will make you laugh and/or be amazed. Even some that seem like minor side characters, end up being important in some way. There is someone in the series for everyone to like and it is very easy to find a new favorite character in Kill La Kill. Development is not much of an issue as every single character has an in your face personality and it is easy to get to know them from the beginning. While they aren't too deep there is a lot of substance there and you just cant but help to love the cast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Feelings\\n\r\nI loved watching Kill La Kill. It was a refreshing series that brought me so many moments of laughter and pure joy. I constantly found myself saying wow or laughing my ass off at the variety of crazy scenes in the show. Also, I couldn't help but root for the wonderful cast of characters and their ranges of personalities. With smooth, fun animation and a fitting soundtrack, Kill La Kill was an absolute pleasure to watch. I would easily recommend it to friends and just as easily re-watch it with them. My only complaints, and this is just nit picking really, are the overused transformation scene, somewhat played out songs, and borderline overboard fanservice. But other than that if you haven't yet start watching Kill La Kill. You will not be disappointed and you will surely enjoy yourself. Thanks for reading, hope this helped!",

            "content": "Kill La Kill a modern masterpiece!\r\nIts been such a long time since I watched an anime that all of its aspects were so well thought and polished.\r\nJust by seeing the poster image I immediately realized the amazing design. The whole picture was awesome and the logo was a design achievement. I thought I must watch this! Looks like their designers know what they're doing while being original...I kind of studied graphic arts for a while so I can see that many talented people have worked on this.\r\nAnd the day I got it in my hands came...\r\nSTORY: The basic concept of this world at first looksextravagant and a little bit too much, the idea of the life threads... a little far fetched. BUT there's a perfectly good and reasonable explanation about everything and when the plot starts to unfold everything falls into place and makes perfect sense. So concept-wise this is genuinely original and it works!\\n\\n\r\nHow is it implemented? The answer is : PERFECTLY! The way the story unfolds, the steady progression ,the development of the plot, the twists of fate ...just everything is how it should be. The script writer is a very good storyteller and trust me watching this you wont feel annoyed by pointless dialogue or needless characters or needless episodes as we have suffered through while watching other anime. I'm not gonna say anything more about this out of fear of ruining it with sploilers. Its been a long time since I watched an anime with such good storytelling and script.\\n\\n\r\nART: Simply awesome. The color palette , the nostalgic designs and the simple but quite impressive and epic visual effects come together to offer you a visual orgasm. They went ahead and created an original art style that somehow feels nostalgic and reminds us that a good anime doesn't really have to go crazy with 3d pc graphics and all the colors of the rainbow. Not to mention that the look of this anime feels like reading a colored manga. Excellent art! The anime industry has a lot to learn from kill la kill.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Most people refer to the op and the ending of an anime in most of the reviews I've read in MAL. Do you know why? Cause most anime only have that to show. Kill La Kill has one of the most EPIC scores I've ever listened to and it can easily earn an Oscar or two and make Hollywood feel ashamed, seriously the score sounds like it came from an epic American super hero movie. The sound effects are just perfect and the voice actors are really impressive on how they manage to flesh out the characters. The songs are also great with the \"don't loose your way\" being one of the best songs I've heard for a transformation scene plus its instrumental orchestral version is soooo epic! Consider me impressed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Oh its been so long since I've seen so powerful characters. They are all so strong and will definitely leave an impression. Very good development through the story. All of them are well placed in the plot with each one of them having their own reasons and distinct agendas. Well designed, great voice acting and powerful presence! In this anime the characters are the ones who are progressing the story and not the other way around,...you must have watched a lot of anime lately where the concept or story forces the characters forward in weird ways that make the characters become almost transparent. In kill la kill the characters and their personalities are well defined and fleshed out resulting in amazing performances! You will remember them for a long time and you'll love them. Specially I mention Mako as the most amazing and enjoyable comic relief. Don't mistaken her for moe. The girl is all about comedy!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: you can obviously see that I totally enjoyed this. It felt like I have been watching garbage for a long time until kill la kill came and illuminated me with its pure epicness and awesomeness! The battles are powerful ,the comedy is totally LMAO ...the adventure, the action, the dialogues...OVERALL: OMG this anime is a masterpiece!\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what genre you prefer this anime is a great work of art with an epic story, strong characters that will suck you in its world and give you tons of enjoyment. I believe that this anime is 100% fulfilling  and wont let down no matter how difficult you can be with your taste. It is a MUST WATCH.\\n\\n\r\nthe full 10/10 score is there not because it became one of my favourites but because its that good and it has been such a long time since I've watched an anime that wasn't just great but also artistically excellent showing what the animation industry / art can produce.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is one of my personal favorites.  With a unique setting (not that any high school is a unique anime setting...  just this one), well developed characters, and some of the most action packed, plot twisting, awe inspiring episodes I've had the pleasure of watching, I can't really say anything except...  it's awesome.  \r\nThe plot seems pretty standard at first but develops a lot along with the characters as we get to know the kill la kill universe.  \r\nThe characters are very interesting and offer interesting twists and developments all the way through as well.  Without givingaway any spoilers, I should just say that you can't take anything at face value in this one.  While some of the characters start off as tropes and relatively standard templates, they are always expanded upon and made into their own creation.  I found myself constantly interested in each and every one of them.\\n\r\nPlot wise, get ready for some twists and turns because the anime you're going to be watching at episode 15 is NOT the same one you're watching at episode 1.  There are several U-turns and enormous twists that keep the entire thing really interesting and towards the end, every single episode feels like the series finale.  Seriously, each and every episode feels like the stakes can't get any higher, the fights can't get any crazier, the villains can't be more insane and then the next episode proves all of that wrong and ups the scales even more.  \\n\r\nThe animation is really strong, not the very best, but the stylistic choices are easy to watch and fit very well with the overall feel of the anime.  Also visually, get ready for fanservice.  There's a lot of that.  However, this is the first anime or show or movie or anything that I've seen to work into the plot reasons for why there is so much fanservice.  After they explained it, I was thinking \"Oh yeah!  They do need to show skin.  Lots of it!\"  I mean... it's an excuse, but they put effort into it and it was fun.  Luckily, the fanservice rarely distracts from the action.\\n\r\nThis quirky, funny, exciting anime has a special place for me and I recommend anyone to try it out.  I have heard that some people don't like how it starts and it can be slightly dry early on but trust me, if you can make it to episode 15 (which won't be hard if you liked it as much as I did), you're in for one heck of a ride at the end.\\n\r\nKill la Kill- a well written story, exciting characters, and visuals that make this anime a work of art...  and fanservice.  that too.",

            "content": "I seriously don\u2019t know where to start with the review of this Anime because I just loved it so much. And because I loved it so much I\u2019ll have to be as unbiased as possible in my rating\u2026.I don\u2019t think that turned out so well\u2026\r\nIf you loved TTGL you will absolutely LOVE this. Expect the same madness, craziness and absolute EPICNESS as you would from TTGL in Kill la Kill. Expect unlimited transformations, bad ass finishers and repetitive but incredibly awesome super moves and powers!! So onward with the review!!\r\nCriteria \r\nStory: 8.5\r\nJust like TTGL this story is incredibly original yet still has the mainthemes of most other Anime that include world domination, infinite plot twists and love and unity. All of these themes combined into one awesome Anime, that being Kill La Kill. Kill La Kill is lightning fast and action packed from the get go, we basically get awesome fight scenes within the first 5 minutes, also did I mention its lightning fast because its lightning fast!\\n\r\nThe story is really about a girl named Ryuuko Matoi who comes home to find her father murdered with a Scissor Blade stuck within him [\u2018Find the other half of the blade and you find the murderer, but your life will be turned upside down\u2019] are her father\u2019s last words. \\n\r\nThe Scissor Blade eventually takes her to Honnouji Academy where she meets Satsuki Kiryuuin (The Student Council President) who reigns over Honnouji Academy as if she were god. Ryuuko believes that Satsuki knows the secrets behind the Scissor Blade and will do anything to make her cough them up!\\n\r\nWhat starts of as a story for revenge ends up becoming a story to save all of earth (see the TTGL comparison). As she dives deeper into this new world she learns about things called Goku Uniforms, life fibers and Sailor Suits also known as Kamui\u2019s, what do these things all mean, what are they used for and how will she overcome all these insane powerhouses that stand before her? The only way you will ever find out is if you watch Kill La Kill!!!\\n\r\nHowever it really is impossible to describe the story like this because there is just so much going on!\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 8.5\\n\r\nA sad, joyful, conclusive and definitive yet somewhat open ending, what more could anyone ask for. I had about 30 emotions going on while watching the last episode of Kill La Kill, but the main one was \u2018I WANT MORE\u2019. Basically of all the Anime series that didn\u2019t deserve a second\u2019s series, this one bloody hell better get a second series!! It\u2019s really impossible to describe the ending without spoilers, but I\u2019ll leave it at this if you watched TTGL, expect MASSIVE fights, MASSIVE transformations and somewhat tears of sadness, joy and frustration!  \\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 9\\n\r\nProbably what I believe to be one of the most solid plots in an Anime, ever single action taken or word spoken has some minor detail that all leads up to the greater scheme of things. The plot twist of some you will see coming (depending on how good at mysteries you are), there are also a thousand and one you will NEVER see coming. It\u2019s absolutely brilliant how they able to tie everything together, and then for it to actually all make sense is just something else completely. The only downside was the filler episode in the 4th episode however it served its comedic purpose as it was very funny.\\n\\n\r\nMoral: 8.5\\n\r\nThere are so many morals and message to take out of Kill La Kill that it becomes hard to keep up with them all, yet the most amazing thing is that they are able to explain each one to its fullest. The main two contradicting morals yet also complimentary are \u201cpigs in human clothing\u201d and \u201cwe are not all cut from the same cloth\u201d basically what it really mean is even though we are all the same we are also all different, and that\u2019s what makes this world so beautiful and amazing the fact that two contradicting matters can be so complimentary to each other. \u201cPigs in human clothing\u201d is basically the Anime\u2019s way of saying we are all human i.e we are all the same and \u201cwe are not cut from the same cloth\u201d is also the Anime\u2019s way of saying we are all unique in our own way. So basically in other words even though we may all be different we should treat each other the same because we are all human. \\n\r\nKill la Kill also discusses the boundary between friends and family and how one can essentially also be the other, and also how \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018family\u2019 are just words unless they are acted upon, a dark and cruel yet also true realization. \\n\\n\r\nSense: 8\\n\r\nWith so much going on in Kill La Kill I was fascinated by how much sense it made and how they were actually able to make it make so much sense. I don\u2019t think that they actually left any question unanswered, which is a first for me watching an anime.\\n\r\nHowever there were times during Kill La Kill were events just seemed to convenient which is why I gave it an 8 instead of a perfect 10. There are also some other events and mechanics that don\u2019t make sense unless I spoil them so I\u2019m not going to do so, you\u2019ll just have to watch the Anime to figure out what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nOh My God! Is really all I have to say about the music for Kill La Kill. If the BGM is still playing in the back of your head even after you\u2019ve finished the anime, then you know they\u2019ve done a good job. And I could never get enough of Kill La Kills Background Music; it was just so epicly epic. The music complimented the scenes extremely well and possible elevated the set mood tenfold. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAn incredible job with art as expected from the makers of TTGL (of which the art I also loved). Everything from the explosions, to fire, to water, to scenery was done amazingly well. The only necessary flaw I found in the art was how all the cannon fodder, all the extras etc. where drawn exactly the same, however I also found that to be useful in expressing the ideology of \u201cpigs in human clothing\u201d.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5\\n\r\nThe characters were absolutely genius, everything from their designs to their names I found amazing. Who would ever forget a name such as Gamagoori or Sanketsu or Junketsu their names where purely unique and amazing. Also all of the main characters where given each their own back story, which allows us to understand why some characters are so loyal to each other. There is also an incredible amount of character progression and development physically, mentally, emotionally and psychologically. \\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 10\\n\r\nThere was NEVER EVER a dull moment with Kill La Kill, it was always either one of the following, extremely funny, extremely jam packed with action, extremely mysterious and at some points extremely annoying (but in the good annoying way). Filled with manipulation, backstabbing, forgiveness, trust, fighting, laughing there was never a dull moment in Kill La Kill\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 9\t\\n\r\nTo be honest\u2026I would\u2019ve given Kill La Kill a perfect 10 if it wasn\u2019t for my stubborn belief that only one Anime deserves a perfect 10 and I am yet to find that Anime, however if this anime gets a Season 2 I\u2019ll give this Anime a perfect 10 in a heartbeat because that is really all it is missing, a second season. Would I recommend this Anime? Does that question even need to be answered yet alone asked? Uh Duh I recommend this Anime and if you haven\u2019t watched it yet, what the hell are you doing with your time?\\n\r\nHowever I do find that this Anime would be more towards lovers of TTGL so if you didn\u2019t like that, you may not like this.\\n\r\nThe only real major down side to this Anime is its way over repetitiveness with Super Moves (not super powers of which there are way too many), the finishing super mover, similar to the Kamehameha, is way overused. (Note the finishing move is only similar to the Kamehameha in the way it\u2019s overused, the attack itself does not resemble the Kamehameha in any way what so ever).\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nComedy: 8.5\\n\r\nThe real main comedic purpose of this anime is to break it away from all the action, because there is just way too much action, with said the comedic parts, I found, are extremely funny.\\n\\n\r\nAction: 9\\n\r\nAction, Action, Action more Action with a side serving of Action\u2026did I mention there was a lot of action?\\n\r\nIf you love action based Anime then you will love Kill la Kill!\\n\\n\r\nMystery: 8\\n\r\nAlso a great watch for those mystery lovers, however depending on how good you are at seeing foreshadowing then the mystery may be clear as day, however I guarantee that you will never see this ending coming! \\n\\n\r\nSuper Powers: 9\\n\r\nSimilar to the liked of TTGL there are about 20 different if not more character transformation that take place in Kill La Kill which is just an overdose of Super Powers. So if you\u2019re like me and just love to see super power, after super power, after super power, than you will love Kill La Kill! \\n\\n\r\nSuper Moves: 7\\n\r\nA stated earlier even though the super moves are awesome they are also way too overused, basically every enemy she defeats is defeated with the exact same super finishing move. Regardless I never tire of seeing it, except for when it was used literally 10 times in a row.\\n\\n\r\nI could probably talk about Kill La Kill forever but let\u2019s just end it with this:\\n\r\nI hope this review was as accurate, unbiased and spoilerless as possible, thank you for reading the review :D\\n\r\nOh lastly\u2026.there is quite a good Ecchi element to Kill La Kill\u2026so if you are into that kind of thing\u2026you may be into Kill La Kill",

            "content": "I must say, the anime is plain amazing.  Similar to Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann, the animation indeed is very fluid. Trigger did a great job animating parts that matters and areas that viewers will focus, while reducing animation on areas that don't really matter. The art style is really cute, especially mako, except that I would prefer the study body to include some females instead of multiple clones of the same guy with the exact same coconut hair style. The development of Ryuko is done pretty well, while the hallelujah moments of mako are really a nice touch. The comedy mainly belongs to thecute mako, a best friend anybody would want ^-^\\n\\n\r\nI dropped it once before as I heard the equipment they use have too much fan service, but this fan service is just a side thing that wasn't even a focus in the story, which is very nice.  I feel that all the important characters in the anime has proper spotlight given to them to be developed, if we ignore the fact that the base of the story line is pretty absurd, for it's a battle between clothes and mankind. Overall, I did enjoy all 24 episodes, and the final special is a pretty nice touch. Hence, rating it 9 stars out of 10. If you like SAO and adventure kind of thing, this is really right up your alley.",

It isn't \"Oh look, I recognise that trope and it's making fun of it\". \r\nIf you used that same line of thinking then Hot Shots 1 & 2 are both great works of satire as they ridicule over the top action films of the 80s. This is obviously not the case. They are stupid for comedy sake and they even fail at that and Kill La Kill falls under the same category.\r\n\"American Psycho\", is what true satire is, mocking a truly morally bankrupt society with absolutely no values but also being rewardedfor it with wealth and status. Kill La Kill is just DUMB and I was not engaged with ANYTHING that was happening. The characters, the story, the plot etc. It was just all so idiotically stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe joke got old REAL fast and I only watched 7 episodes, this could only appeal to hardcore anime fans, particularly ones who have seen a lot of shounen. \\n\\n\r\nKill La Kill is a spoof.

            "content": "Kill la kill was so unexpectedly good. I cant believe I havent watched this anime sooner. \r\nStory- 9 \r\nThe story was so epic. It was cool. It was awesome. it was Unexpected. Yet it was only about clothes. Somehow, kill la kill made me so deeply invested in a show that was about how people are people and clothes are clothes. It is so...different. Its refreshing to have a story where you cant actually expect anything because everything is so freaking unexpected. As stated by some other viewers, Every kill la kill episode feels like the final episode and its so great how it doesthat without getting old or stale. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nThe art style of Kill la Kill is unique, just like nearly everything about the anime. In a period where nearly all the animes look like carbon copies of eachother art wise, Kill la Kill really stands out. Its bold and flashy while also looking more like manga than a computer generated image. It greatly adds to the feel and mood of the anime and I think that the anime would have not fitted in with any other art style. While some people may complain about its \"lack of finish\" and \"ugly look\", if you watch the anime you will understand that this particular type of unique art fits in almost perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 10 \\n\r\nWhile the opening and closing songs of Kill la Kill are pretty good (I prefer the first opening over the second one), it is the theme songs and back ground music that truly shine and stun. Hearing \"DONT LOSE YOUR WAYYYYY\" and \"Hallelujah\" immediately bring chills and memories of various memorable scenes in the anime. A few songs like \"dont lose you way\" and Ragyo Kiryuuin's theme is so brilliant, especially the second one. Actually as stated by some other viewers, Ragyo Kiryuuin's theme is one of the most pure forms of villan music that has ever been played in Anime. It is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\r\nThe character development is outstanding. For the first time ever I feel attached to nearly every single main and side character in the series (except for Harumie nui and Ragyo kiryuuin as I despise them as i should since they are villans). The character that is particularly interesting as well as intriguing is Satsuki Kiryuuin. Without spoiling too much, she goes from hated to loved due to one single episode. Its amazing how well the creators made the characters so likeable as well is unique and interesting, of which i have never experienced in any other anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall score- 10/10\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell if you have read until now, I love this anime alot. Although that may make me slightly bias, I truly feel that it is amazing and that it is an anime that everyone should watch. From the start where it feels like nice and relaxing with forms of awesome excitement mixed in where in the end you are constantly pulling out your hair, waiting eagerly for the next scene and the next twist. It is a sensation that is rare in anime and can be very badly done. Thankfully with Kill la Kill, they did it well. They did it extremely well and we can all be thankful for how well they did it. So in the end I urge you to take my word. Watch it. Watch it but do not rush it. Enjoy it  because this is an anime that you will enjoy.",

            "content": "Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann - female edition\r\nThat pretty much sums it up, basically it had a lot what made Gurren Lagann fun, just in smaller quantity, and like Gurren Lagann was a homage to super robot, this is a homage to magical girls. It fails to live up to Gurren Lagann but by itself it is still a good watch.\r\nStory - 6\r\nThere are a lot of twist and turns, but really if you focus on the plot, you are missing the point. The story makes a lot of parody of common tropes while playing other straight, the angsty teen MC, the revenge plot, \"Luke Iam your mother\", etc. But let's be honest here, the plot is a fucking mess, in the end buried beneath the spectacle is a coming of age story for the female MC.\\n\\n\r\nBut the same can be said about Gurren Lagann as well, which I also don't consider to have much of a plot that doesn't boil down to a coming of age. So the question is does the spectacle of Kill la Kill measure up to the spectacle of Gurren Lagann, Let's see, Gurren Lagann had multiple meaningful side character death on the MC side, so I'm going to say no.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end if you just want a spectacle plot, than Kill la Kill would satisfy your wants.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about Kijin Sei...I mean Matoi Ryuuko (damn those two look similar, Trigger must have played DDC or else drunk minds think alike). She is a rebellious teen, with angsty issue (just like Seija), whose development flips back and forth (just like Seija), and her plotline ends kind of anti-climatic (just like Seija).  Fortunately for you Trigger, I like Seija a lot, so I'm willing to let Seija 2.0 slide for having a lot of personality defects that didn't get a proper rap up like Simon's did. And that's good cause there ARE a lot of problems that never rapped up, unlike Simon who is now old and passed the torch, Kill la Kill ended with a \"back to normal life\" where Ryuuko's development never got the old Simon rap up, so considering her back and forth development she might just flip again, and the development never come across as strong as Simon's did.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Shinmyou...I mean Mako, who serves as the comic relief, which is good, cause if Kill la Kill took itself too serious than that would be a disaster, so I think she fits the tone of the series, by injecting a decent dose of stupid into the show. And as a character she balances Ryuuko's angst well enough.\\n\\n\r\nSenketsu is the mentor role, there isn't much to talk about him, he fits Kamina's role (including death).\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the villain and anti-hero\\n\\n\r\n Satsuki is the secondary protagonist, and her story is actually very interesting, her story-line of rebelling against her mother and relationship with the Four, paints a very solid background. In addition, her stern and more mature personality shows a great contrast to Ryuuko, making her stand-out the most in all of the characters. As a rival role, she is quite perfect, and there isn't much to say, pretty solid character as long as she isn't the MC.\\n\\n\r\nNui is evil Mako.\\n\\n\r\nRagyou is the villain, she fits the role of the anti-spiral, AKA, final boss, and that is her entire character schtick. \"Blow up the world\" is basically her motivation and target and basically everything defining her. There is a \"logic\" that she says, but it is too coo-coo to matter. Overall, she is the final boss, because we have to have a final boss.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else have personlity and quirks and some background, but I feel that these background drown out Ryuuko's story rather helping it, so instead of having one very memorable character, we have a lot of slightly memorable characters all meshed together in to a bland mesh.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Music - 8,9\\n\\n\r\nLike Gurren Lagann but cheaper, the music is better than Lagann, but the animation sometimes turn into PPT.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nEnjoyable time sink, hope that no one try this style ever again, it was fun the first time, okay the second time, and the third time would probably be a horrible mesh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I swear Trigger played DDC, the similarities are uncanny.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is a pretty outstanding series in terms of how on earth can a show so action packed, fast paced and stylish still leave me feeling painfully underwhelmed.  But, to be honest I\u2019m probably being a bit too harsh, as KLK in its entirety is merely a reflection of the entertainment industry across the board \u2013 all flash and zero substance. It took a lot of A LOT of effort to finish this show as I found almost every aspect of it\u2019s being to be a backbreaking, sickening experience that undoubtedly undermined, and maybe even lowered the intellect of just about everyonewho watched it. But as I already stated, KLK only mimics the problems within today\u2019s entertainment in how lacking it is in both quality and substance. It\u2019s a big disappointment but hardly a surprise. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of KLK revolves around two rival female characters Satsuki Kiryuin and Matoi Ryuko, the former is some kind of military/corporate/class president- dictator? (I dunno) whose initial goal is to gain world domination via the control of clothing. The latter is an underdog misfit looking to avenge the death of her wayward father. In between all that are numerous subplots that contain forced romance, some almost interesting relationships, a lot of bullshitted philosophy and political undertones that only serve to further muddle an already confusing story. In fact, that about encompasses everything wrong with KLK in how it completely lacks self awareness and it can\u2019t seem to make up its mind as to whether or not it wants viewers to take it seriously.  Boob jokes are being uttered within the same breath of discussing a flawed and oppressive government. It\u2019s a cringe-worthy balance of political satire and obscenity. Most of KLK just leaves me unsure of whether I\u2019m supposed to laugh at or ponder over what\u2019s being said and more important how it was delivered. Even the artwork is in conflict with the dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nOn its own, the style of Kill La Kill is quite good and so was the animation, which I\u2019m going to assume was intentionally sloppy as to parody old shounen animes. Yet even this added more work to the already tedious job of taking KLK seriously which is hardly to say that I don\u2019t like parodies. Actually, the first show to come to mind upon starting KLK was Panty and Stocking. They both use schools as a backdrop for hinting at mature, political topics especially in reference to Eastern vs. Western views of death, religion and economics. But by no means did you have to take them seriously or even recognize these themes to enjoy the show and at no point in time were we beaten over the head with winded speeches about idealisms and morals. PSG presented a number of topics with a level of subtlety, smartness and an impeccable sense of timing that Kill la Kill just doesn\u2019t possess.\\n\\n\r\nMy last problem with Kill la Kill is how it\u2019s confused a lot of viewers into thinking this is some sort of new amazing thing allegedly reviving anime as a genre. That might be the case if the year was 1992 (when animes like this were charms WITHIN the genre, they didn\u2019t DEFINE it) and not 2014  where every second anime released is an onslaught of stupid harems, fan service and *whispers* ~shock factor~. \\n\r\nGruel doesn't suddenly turn into a steak dinner upon receiving it larger amounts than what your used to eating and Kill la Kill exemplifies that. What anime isn\u2019t doing what KLK did? What has KLK done that other shows aren\u2019t still doing, and doing to death? \\n\\n\r\nAnswer: not a damn thing. \\n",

            "content": "If you've seen Gurren Lagann and liked it, you would also like Kill la Kill, simple as that.\r\nMy first impression of Kill la Kill before watching it was that it would be a school anime with some low class superpowers and quite a lot of ecchi. And boy was I wrong. I've been putting this anime off because I didn't find it worth the time but after watching it, I have to admit that this is simply one of the best anime I've seen in terms of a complete story, action, fighting and powers.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe progression of the story is nice. It's quite easy tokeep up with the pace and learn how the story works and the past of the events. The characters are easy to remember and can easily be linked with the story.\\n\r\nIt's your everyday \"revenge story\" at first. Then it turns into a \"save the world story\". Anyway, it isn't disappointing and difficult to understand. Sure, it might be cliche but I can guarantee that the way of presenting it is amazing and keeps you glued to the screen eager to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe artwork is a comical style. With transformations followed by glimmering lights and the stuff. It's the same art style as TTGL (Gurren Lagann). Though it might seem old for this age of anime but this art style and animation perfectly captures the atmosphere and compliments the story.\\n\r\nAs for character designs, they are quite remarkable. Sure, they didn't go into much depth but still the characters are amazing to look at.\\n\r\nAs for the fight scenes, they are out of this world. Transformations, special powers, signature moves and all other fighting stuff is well made and is amazing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe 1st opening is \"Sirius\" performed by Eir Aoi. It's a nice song to listen to.\\n\r\nThe 1st ending is Gomen ne, Iiko ja Irarenai (Sorry, I can't be a good child) and is as good as to download the full version.\\n\r\nThe 2nd opening is also worth a listen though the 2nd ending doesn't quite meet the mark set by the other songs.\\n\r\nAs for soundtracks of the anime, the main characters have there own theme songs. Some special songs are played during transformations or the winning points of battles.\\n\\n\r\nNot all songs are in japanese. Some are in english and some in german. But the sound department did an awesome job and almost all the music in this anime is amazing and worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nI won't go into much depth here. I'll just say that the characters are really awesome on their own. The main characters each have their own special power. Each has a unique personality and past on the basis of which their powers are related.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say at the moment is that the characters aren't what they look like in the beginning. Going into further depth might act as a spoiler but I can assure you that almost all the characters are likeable except for the bad guys.\\n\r\nYou might've seen some anime in which the bad guys are more liked than the good guys. Well, this isn't like those. The bad guys really are bad till the bitter end. Sure, they have awesome powers and have nice character designs but still, it's hard to come to like them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nIf you're into mecha, sci fi-ish, action, school, transformations, insane fighting, special moves, nice character designs, some fanservice, good story, apocalyptic scenarios and a complete ending, then this anime is for you.\\n\r\nSure, at the start, this anime isn't all I've made it out to be but after about half the series is finished, stuff gets so interesting that you can't stop from watching. And I can guarantee that you will watch the ending 5 episodes in a row.\\n\\n\r\nThough I was into slice of life, romcom anime at the moment and didn't want much of an action type anime but Kill la Kill was definitely worth a watch and I'm glad I watched this action, mecha anime.",

            "content": "Imagine a world where someone tried to take over the world through clothes. Also imagine a school where it was divided in different ranks. Don't they sound so original than every other anime with moe?\r\nYes, KILL la KILL has a great setting. Produced by Studio TRIGGER, who made Little Witch Academia. Its founder, Ootsuka Masahiko, was an assistant director of Gainax's creation, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. KILL la KILL was supposed to be a \"spiritual successor\" of that anime, which I don't want to talk about that.\r\nA mystery murder of Dr. Isshin had led his daughter, Ryuuko, to investigate the matter. She transferred in HonnoujiAcademy, where it wasn't like a normal school you see in anime. She met Mako, an active girl who never failed to smile always, and Satsuki, the school's student council president who acted as the queen in her empire.\\n\\n\r\nOutside the academy, Ryuuko visited her ruined house, where her father was killed. In a surprise, she fell onto the basement where it was filled with piles of trash, through a trapdoor by her homeroom teacher, Aikuro. She heard a sound which came from Senketsu, a \"living\" sailor uniform and it forced her to wear itself. With the powers gained by Senketsu, she saved Mako the next day, when she was about to be fried.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko continued to search for clues over her father's death.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise the whole story in the anime for you, it was full of surprises to awe the audience and there were plot twists which shocked them like mad. The slapstick comedy was funny. I felt that there wasn't any plot holes throughout the story. I loved how the ending really brought to a great closure to the whole story. It left me satisfied. Overall, the story is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was just amazing. After possessing Senketsu, Ryuuko learned more about its history, and eventually she learned more about herself. She always persevered, trying to get Satsuki to give her answers. At one point she gave up on Senketsu, but its speech thought otherwise. Mako also developed, although she kept her usual personality, that she learnt about herself and how bonded she and Ryuuko are.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had a wide range of personalities and skills. The Four Divas, who are Ira, Uzu, Houka and Nonon, are examples of displaying that quality. They too have developed since their childhood past.\\n\\n\r\nKILL la KILL is also great in art. I'm glad that the art direction does not follow that of a typical moe anime. Although the scenery is bland, it does not really matter. The battle scenes are very spectacular, where they feel like real fighting. Its fanservice beautifies the anime well. It is just up to the audience to think of something different, whether naughty or not. The character designs do not strictly follow to all characters, but each character has a unique look. The facial expressions from the characters are great, either portraying real emotions of a character to show something, or exaggerating for comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is superb! I can't stop listening to some of the songs in the OST album. I fell in love with it. This is my first anime to have its OST being loved by myself. All its openings and endings are great. The first opening brought a great drum intro, while the first ending brought out something relaxing. The second opening isn't special, and the second ending is something I felt that it contrasted with the anime's story. But, I still love the both of them.\\n\\n\r\nI started watching KILL la KILL weeks after its first episode, so at first, I was lagging behind. But I caught up afterwards and continued watching on simulcast. If I had not known this anime for being awesome, I would totally miss the fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I want to say this to everyone who never watched KILL la KILL before: watch KILL la KILL and be dazzled!",

            "content": "There are and will be a lot of good anime in this year, but Kill la Kill is and will be one of the best.\r\nKill la Kill is full with fights and action, funny scenes, cute moments and also a lot of fan service, but it's still great even though the characters are almost naked while fighting and the series is like 90% fan service. It's was really nice to see an anime like that. Kill la Kill started pretty simple but the fights, the characters, the plot twists, the surprises, the fact that it is actually pretty simple to understand and the satisfying andgood ending make it very nice and enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kill la Kill's are some of the most brilliant and best I've ever seen, and the best thing is, that the main characters are female. There aren't that many anime with strong, independent females, but not in Kill la Kill. Even though they wear short clothes, fight almost naked/naked or lose their clothes during fights, they are still wonderful, lovable characters, who you would never even dare to disrespect. In a lot of anime it isn't like that - the girls who wear clothes so short and tight that you can see everything are often just weak, annoying, not very strong, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt's nice that the student council president, and the strongest at Honnouji Academy is a girl, just like the antagonists and protagonists. Also Ryuuko is wonderful. She isn't girly, she's more guyish, and those kind of female characters are my favourite. Not all girls are girly and it's not very easy to fit in society when you are like that, that's why I like anime with strong \"guyish\" girls. They let me think that it is ok if you, for example; don't like wearing pink, dresses, etc. and it's a shame that there aren't more female characters like that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, of course not all the girls in Kill la Kill are very strong and smart, for example Mankashoku Mako, but still she wants to protect Ryuuko and is always there for here. She's pretty lovable, nice, funny and kinda eases the situation.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the females are great, the males are wonderful as well, and even they get naked, which I find pretty amusing, because I've never seen an anime  where the males get naked, are nudists, etc. But, what I find very surprising, that Kill la Kill even had an amazing sailor uniform with a handsome voice, which had a better character then some of anime boys/men.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was actually pretty ok, sometimes it wasn't the best (like in all anime), but you still could enjoy it a lot, even though I found it kinda weird that the females didn't have nipples but the males ? (Kill la Kill was probably one of the few anime where boys/men really have nipples.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also great, the characters had nice themes which fit them perfectly, for example Nui Harime's theme. Nui looks actually cute, but she's crazy and psychotic and her theme is just like that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill maybe isn't perfect, but in my opinion it is still a great anime and a masterpiece and also, one of my favourites. I enjoyed it a lot, and if you don't know what anime to watch next, then I suggest you Kill la Kill. You definitely won't regret watching it ! Belive me.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Also, sorry that my English isn't the best, but I just really wanted to write a review, because I love Kill la Kill so much.)",

            "content": "I watched the first episode of Kill la Kill and I was completely thrown off thinking of it as another generic ecchi ( I actually enjoy watching some here and there) but it seemed to take itself too seriously in the first episode and I felt it was trying too hard. I actually left it for a month or two then I forced myself to watch it and I realized I had totally jumped the gun and that the skin being shown was not there only for gratification purposes, but as absurd as it may sound it was an integral part of the story thatmade a lot of fashion sense.(Sorry I could not resist!) \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story it was extremely enjoyable and solid in that it was an action anime based on clothes and it stayed true to the source material.(I assure you the puns are not being done on purpose) Everything has an explanation and connects very well and complements other story elements, the mystery that is left is such that it leaves you pleasantly wondering instead of trying to tear your hair out and yet the plot is pretty fast paced the action will sweep you up and throw you all over the place, and for all that you will like it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters this anime provided me with a plethora of enjoyable characters that added so much to my overall enjoyment. The characters have principles and stick to them, but are willing to bend and twist to accommodate differing situations, thus giving it a very human feel, fueling how much I got caught up in the story and how much I related to the characters, each and every one of them instead of a select few. I have my favorites but I could understand where the other characters were coming from.\\n\\n\r\nThe one aspect that left me a bit jarred is the artwork, especially on action scenes, which changed perspective so many times and went so fast that I had to pause or rewind so frequently that I felt that it could have been done better. The artwork itself is not the problem, its just that on action scenes or where there is a lot of movement it may leave you slightly confused. Other than that I had no other problems.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend Kill la Kill to anyone? Of course I would, it is one surprisingly original and brings together two aspects that you would not normally see being melded into one, that is fashion and action. Watch Kill la Kill if you are the type who wants to explore and find something that gives you emotion, action, brains and all in one Kill la Kill is most definitely for you.",

After every episode i asked myself \"how will it go on?\". So long story in short form: I watched all 24 episodes on one day. After finishing it i was so flashed by the anime i couldn't believe it myself. The main characters real personality is more and more come through inthe end and i liked this very much. The developement of their feelings and their past makes the story even greater! so definitely a 10/10 + fav from me!",

That is not saying Kill La Kill is a clone of either anime: Kill la Kill is a show with a flavor all its own, an atmosphere that is unique even among anime. It's loud, lewd, chock full of unnecessary fanservice, and not an anime you can watch in the living room, unless your living room fully embraces glowing, flopping,nipple-less, naked titties. If it does, well, then make sure you have surround sound, because the anime's fantastic soundtrack probably sounds even better through speakers larger than headphones.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single episode of Kill la Kill is action packed to the brim, and the anime doesn't sport a single slowly paced episode. Even the episodes that are obviously filler are an absolute blast to watch, and when the final episode finally rockets into Finale Station, it truly is the height of an already ridiculously action-y anime. Fun. That is Kill la Kill's greatest strength, and why I give the show a 10 on enjoyment. Kill la Kill is the perfect show to watch when all you want to do is settle down with a bag of sweets and turn off your brain for a while. \\n\\n\r\nI would not suggest watching Kill la Kill for the plot; the premise of super powered clothes has been done before, though most definitely not in the way Kill la Kill does it. The plot twists and elements will be familiar to any habitual anime watcher. The plot's premise, without the whole clothes aspect, is not unique, but it is executed in a fun way unparalleled by any other show I have ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Killl's characters and personalities, too, are not unique on their own, and many characters have little development to speak of. But, when watching the show, you do not care. I still cannot find it in my heart to care, because i grew to love every single one, even (and especially) a certain blonde, eyepatch-sporting Couturier. Kill la Kill spawned many great characters that will most likely be remembered for a long time, including a mother that, hands down, beats Shou Tucker and Gendo Ikari for the title of \"Worst Anime Parent in History.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kill la KIll is a 90's throwback-esque/FLCL extravaganza, with lots of movement, crazy character proportions, and colorful designs. I love the style. The art takes a notabe downturn in certain episodes, but it almost always readjusts to its former quality a few episodes later.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill, in my opinion, is not one of the best anime ever, but it is inarguably one of the most fun.",

            "content": "MILD SPOILER REVIEW\r\nOnline I'm surrounded by a fairly healthy community not only with diverse tastes in Anime but diverse tastes in general. However, mainstream Anime always seems to be a trigger for a number of them. Kill la Kill initially proved to be somewhat of an exception, but upon returning after several weeks of absence they were playing a different tune. One night just as I was going to bed my iPod started going off with notifications from a chat I was in with a number of these people, and they were talking about Kill la Kill. All the people I had seen speak positivelywere now speaking negatively, with extreme aggression at that. I had only seen five episodes, but I could see these complaints were blown out of proportion, so rather than simply sit on the outside like I did when people were complaining about Attack on Titan, I decided to see what it was all about and got back in to the series.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself a bit puzzled by the nature of the series upon getting back into it. I wasn't sure whether it had lost its mind or whether it was all just one big joke. I eventually leaned towards the latter, but in a more meaningful way than simply appreciating the humour. I viewed it as fundamentally perfect parody, part perfect for grounding itself in a few of the basics and part absurd in the nature of its ideas. What came next was figuring out what exactly it was parodying. My first thought was battle shonen parody because its essence was that of a battle shonen, not to mention I viewed certain aspects such as the minute and a half recap episode and Mako's interruption of Ryuuko's angst-driven ramblings early on in the second part as light-hearted stabs at battle Shonen clich\u00e9s, but what about the lewdness of the series? What about the basic story and character clich\u00e9s that aren't particularly present in battle Shonens? It was too broad for me to really make a concise judgment of what it was parodying, but upon finding an Anime analyst by the name of Bobduh just days before the finale and reading an article he wrote on the second to last episode (article right here:http://wrongeverytime.com/2014/03/24/kill-la-kill-episode-23/), I came to the realisation that Kill la Kill was a parody of fanservice in general. Not just in terms of sexual fanservice, but the general idea of appealing to the audience with things that provoke simple compelled reactions. It shamelessly covers the entire spectrum of fanservice clich\u00e9s with an amusingly tongue-in-cheek mentality.\\n\\n\r\nBeing so tongue-in-cheek, Mako is the one problem I find with the series as, quite frankly, she just isn't funny most of the time. That's not to say she's annoying, though. She does in fact hold a pretty decent role as a character in a parody series in that she foils all attempts the series makes to take itself too seriously. Many people are critical of its animation inconsistencies but I couldn't even will myself to be critical of it. At first it was simply because I accepted it as parody because of the fluctuance in quality, but much more than that I realised, in the grand scheme of things, it didn't really mean anything to me. I was way too swept up in the broken illusion of fiction and the sheer density of things happening to even consider it. Kill la Kill isn't going to be too fun if you simply critique its fundamentals and not the sum of its parts. Hell, if you critique anything by just picking on the basics of story, characters and animation your interpretation is going to be incredibly shallow and jaded, but Kill la Kill in particular has such an absurd execution that it deserves a different perspective. It doesn't give Kill la Kill enough credit to simply call it style over substance, it's literally pure concentrated style. For that reason to get swept up in the series is rarely to get swept up in its matter but rather the feeling it gives to see something so bizarre play out and generally just to see, well, lots of big things happening. I'm being simultaneously complex and simplistic about what I'm saying, but the series brings out that desire in me not only to be blown away by the essence of its face value but to really appreciate how and why that face value gets me. The final two episodes of the series captured me in that way most of all, and so in finishing the series I'm left with a very positive impression.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to sum up Kill la Kill is that it's an anomaly. It's such a simple series at its core but it says so much about the beast of fanservice Anime has become by using so many aspects of it to essentially build a series from the ground up. Not only is it a damn near unstoppable candidate for my 2014 Anime of the Year, but also a new series to sit proudly among my all-time favourites. It's dense, it's fun, it's stylish, it's amusing. Kill la Kill is a wild and effervescent beast of a series with so little yet so much.",

            "content": "I had heard a lot about Kill La Kill, so I expected great things. I watched the first episode and thought \"this isn't for me\". The story seemed cliche, I wasn't sold on the over the top art style and the amount of fanservice on offer was just too much to handle.\r\nWhen the series was nearing completion, everyone was still talking about Kill La Kill, so I thought I would give it a second chance. After completing the second episode I was hooked. \r\nWhat I realised about Kill La Kill is that it is unashamed of what it is, and fully embraces all of it'stropes. The story, whilst seemingly shallow at first glance, manages to put a fresh spin on a tale of revenge, often making fun of itself in the process. Humour is where Kill La Kill really shines, and helps to push this show over the edge in terms of how bonkers it can get. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation can sometimes be a little haphazard, but the loose style suits the feel of the show, and gives the action sequences energy. The show uses a limited colour palette most of the time, which almost gives it a manga come to life feel. \\n\\n\r\nYes there is plenty of fan service. But nudity isn't limited to just the female characters, or to any character. Pretty much everyone is naked at one point or another, and ends up becoming pivotal to the storyline, as strange as that sounds. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill La Kill took me by surprise, and I am glad I gave it another look. An energetic thrill ride with plenty of laughs, Kill La Kill may be one of the best anime series in recent history.",

            "content": "The first few times I heard the words \"Kill la Kill\", I was far from excited. Other than Pok\u00e9mon and Dragon Ball Z, sh\u014dnen usually isn't my thing. With the exception of those few anime that I grew up watching and can't help loving, it just tends to be too... well, boyish. Not only that, but the art style (or what I'd seen of it) didn't really appeal and the show as a whole didn't seem very interesting to me. How wrong I was. I'm so glad that I decided to give in to the hype and watch this show, because what I'd expected wasnot what I got. What I did get was fast-paced, unrelenting fun and non-stop action with plenty of fanservice and enough silliness to keep even the most restless person in awe. But I also got an interesting story, likeable characters and a soundtrack that would satisfy any music lover with its incredible blend of styles and genres.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in Kill la Kill is deceptively interesting, spending the better part of 24 episodes seeming as though it exists purely to keep the action and craziness moving. And in some ways, that's kind of true. This show is, as many others have said, definitely more style than substance, but even so, the story was compelling enough to keep me asking \"what happens next?\" and it continued to keep that standard from beginning to end. I wasn't just sticking around because the show was so much fun - I also genuinely wanted to know where the story would go next and whether or not the problems faced by the characters could be overcome. In essence, it's a typical coming-of-age story, with Ryuko facing issues either the same as or symbolic of those that every teenage girl does, only on a far more extreme level which is both far more exciting and more confusing than real life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation during some scenes might not be perfect, there's no doubt that this show has style. Right from the beginning, it felt more like something that had been made twenty years ago than something brand new, and it was this exciting sense of nostalgia that first won me over when I finally started watching. While the art is far from the cute, girly styles that I normally enjoy, there's something undeniably appealing about a show that is neither riddled with moe blobs or a sufferer of \"same-face syndrome\". Every character here looks completely different, and their proportions are constantly being changed and exaggerated in a way that really highlights just how ridiculous and over-the-top this show is. Interestingly, the one thing that seemed to turn off most people - that is, the (arguably) excessive fanservice - never bothered me at all. In fact, I didn't even notice a lot of it after the first few episodes, because there was always so much going on that I didn't have time to pay attention to it. I will say though, that Ryuko's transformation sequence came up just a little too often for my liking in the earlier episodes, when I would've preferred if the show would just get going, but it's such a satisfying sequence that I can forgive Trigger for wanting to repeat it as often as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nDON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAYYYYYYYY!! Okay, but seriously, the soundtrack to Kill la Kill is about as close to perfection as you can get without actually being perfect and it just seems to get better and better the more you warm to it. From the upbeat openings and end songs to the incredibly fitting character themes, there is really nothing to complain about here. Sawano Hiroyuki's chaotic mix of pop, rock, electro and classical creates a backdrop that fits Kill la Kill almost as well as Senketsu fits Ryuko, and the fact that the music is always implemented at precisely the right moment brings the entire show up to another level. Without doubt, some of the scenes in the show would have had half the impact they did if it weren't for the incredible use of music. The seiyuu also do an amazing job and are well-suited to the roles they played.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point in the show comes in the form of its immensely charismatic range of characters. From the fierce and stubborn Ryuko and the unwaveringly prideful Satsuki, to the flamboyant and flirty Mikisugi and the loyal (but still unique and individual) Elite Four, every character feels fleshed out and three-dimensional. I immediately found myself empathising with the characters, and couldn't help but find myself rooting for both the protagonists and antagonists because both sides were so likeable. For the most part, the characters showed a good deal of growth and also their fair share of setbacks, which helped to make them more human. Even Senketsu has a great deal of character development over the course of the show, and despite starting out as nothing much more exciting than a talking sailor uniform, he actually ended up being one of my favourite characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it was the combination of the story, art, sound and cast that made Kill la Kill truly enjoyable. It's a show that somehow manages to be ridiculous, hilarious, exhilarating and heartbreaking, sometimes all at once. There were moments when I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry, and ended up doing both. Some scenes had my heart racing and shivers running down my spine, while others had me in fits of laughter. It had enough plot to keep it from being pointless, and it had enough silliness and sexiness for a classroom full of sugar-hyped teenage boys. Put simply, every episode was worthwhile, and every episode left me craving more. So thanks, Trigger. It's been one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "The Linguistics of Kill la Kill - The Impact of Dynamic Romantic Leads, Fascism, Fashion, Feminism, and Energy\r\nDespite the wave of Kill la Kill being over, I chose it solely because it is still one of my favorite anime. Keeping itself on my favorites list for almost 4 long years. Even after I have watched a plentiful amount of anime I would consider better than it. Although this is not to rule out Kill la Kill, as it has aspects that have masterpiece level depth. It may appear shallow but there are things that are capable of keeping me fully invested and engaged with theenvelope it's pushing. let's dive into Trigger's breathtaking introduction. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I know you're thinking; \"Romantic what?\" but you'll see how deep this show gets later on. (Or you can skip to characters to get the just right away)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a show that manages to pack a lot into it's structure. The story in itself is an effective one. A simple coming of age story but with plenty to stand out. Not only that but Kill la Kill has incredible direction, with such blazing fast energy that makes every scene almost feel like a roller coaster. Although Kill la Kiill doesn't have the most compelling story ever... It's unique to say the least and has a lot of great themes but it's not an especially ingenious narrative. In fact it's the weakest aspect of the entire show. I primarily gave it a 7 because of it's undertones, themes, and execution. An overarching tale mostly of Ryuko doing the equivalent of level grinding until she gets stuffed with rare candies in the finale to fight her mom in space. Now the character and relationship development that spurs through the overarching formula is excellent.   \\n\r\nKill la Kill's problem is that it's sci fi like twist isn't fleshed out or unique enough to be so impeccable it completely justified the break from the formula. How they executed the admittedly weak plot was great due to the more emotional moments they get out of the second half. And the themes are not lost in this genre break. The plot just feels more like outlet to create compelling characters as it sacrifices a lot of potential story depth. The plot has no meat on it's own. Although the secondary problem with the plot, in truth, is there are some weak arcs and pacing problems. \\n\r\nKill la Kill's speed shoots Senketsu in the foot making such a unique concept, living clothes that guides and literally covers the hero, a 2 dimensional guide trope instead of a potential 3 dimensional character. Which damages the show a LOT because they're trying to make his arc about learning the real world and adapting to where he borders on human. But the only way to give that level of authenticity would've been to break that 2 dimensional character barrier. \\n\r\nAlthough that just hurts one character honestly, as the other 3 leads, Ryuko Matoi, Mako Mankanshoku, and Satsuki Kiryuin are excellent characters. Their arcs and development are extremely well thought out and perfectly paced. But Senketsu's arc is unfortunately minuscule and poorly paced. This is not the only crime with the pacing although. The pacing is especially detrimental when it reaches a little over the middle of the show. Basically Trigger started to run so fast it tripped up on it's feet. They wanted to make Nui Harime such a threat she could easily destroy Senketsu and while this does contribute to later development for Ryuko, (which I will get to) in this moment she gets back up on her feet so quick it hardly matters. Solving the problem of Senketsu being destroyed in an episode length amount of time, killing any of the stakes spawned by that idea and action. That lack of consequence makes what could've been legitimately threatening idea into a completely botched concept. \\n\r\nWhat also spawns Trigger's trip up in the middle is a 3 episode long mini-arc that feels like it could've been cut out. There are very fun moments but it breaks a clean, straight, forward facing narrative with Honnoji Academy going to war. This whole chunk barely develops the roster of the characters focused on (The Elite 4) which is almost a crime, as 3 of those characters really are two dimensional to begin with and only Sanageyama has an arc. Trigger even dedicates precious time to explain the backstories of all these painfully simple characters, when anyone with basic knowledge of tropes cnd characters in media could easily tell exactly who these characters are just from the first moment they give a glimpse of their personality. Although moments of this are very fun and saved by solid animation and amazing Mako scenes. It's not executed as well as the rest of the show and it was Kill la Kill's awkward period where it was trying to regain it's point. A point which has very surprising strong feminist and anti fascist messages. Initially we see Satsuki's meritocracy. Honnoji is absolute. The bottom tier live in slums and are oppressed and mistreated. But when you start to contribute you are gold. Give into the system and forfeit your individuality or rot in your Ghetto. \\n\r\nHonnoji creates so many problems to those who don't give into it. And those trying to conform to the system that are lower class are taught that you cannot destroy the problems of Fascism with Fascism. Which Mako learns after a heart breaking fight with someone she loves too much and that loves her too much. After she realizes what she's done and that Ryuko is incapable of harming her because they share too close a bond she breaks down crying and abandons the cushioned life Honnoji gave her. As living in slums with her love meant more to her than an easy and rich happy life with her family because she submit to the system. Because fixing your family's problems by accepting a corrupt system in exchange of making another problem means absolutely nothing. Even Ryuko's final arc leads to her losing her way and conforming to the system. She also learns you can't give up your individuality and conform to a system that wants you as a tool. \\n\r\nAlthough Honnoji can not function peacefully and is ran by the wicked head of the head Ragyo Kiryuin who is Satsuki's mother. Satsuki has had no option but to be the systematic oppressor of so many people. All because of her mother. Although much like any dictator, When Ragyo visits the academy, she is meant with an actual stab in the back from someone she trusted. She wants not to usurp Ragyo but her ideals and system. Although Satsuki is ineffective and is punished for her challenge of Honnoji. She isn't even capable of killing Ragyo at full power with a sword designed to. She just can't fully adapt to her Kamui. She as an individual can't overcome the system with a faction so to finally end Ragyo all of the classes band together against the system and destroy it. By all the classes coming as one they break the systematic barriers and destroy the figurehead trying to destroy them for their own personal gain and for those they believe are on top. \\n\\n\r\nThe Kamui are so significant to Kill la Kill. And betrays the idea of the nudity in the show being shallow fanservice. The Kamui are on surface level suits that power you up while exposing you. This correlates a lot to heavy feminist themes of identity and body acceptance. You can't be ashamed of yourself wearing a Kamui as it limits you. And they show your entire being so you HAVE to be proud of that and prevail over your insecurities or else you will never attain your full potential. \\n\r\nIf you don't look at it from a critical/feminist theory perspective you will likely see it as comedic or pandering. Although just like identity you can't judge based on appearance. Since there's so much male and female nudity and Kill la Kill and it's so fast paced, unlike usual fanservice which is directed to make you slowly take in the erotic imagery, you will end up desensitized to it. When desensitized (if it ever even intoxicated at the start) you will start to appreciate what the nudity in Kill la Kill does and means.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a spectacle with amazing direction, great animation, great character designs, and flare. So much flare. A style so distinct and memorable, it leads immediate impression. It's motion is kinetic. So flashy and stylish that it's hard to get bored. Always on the offense with your sense of sight and keeping you hyped. You go scene from scene but when it needs to be serious for important character moments, or when it needs to build up for something. It balances itself out. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is almost a point where I come off as hypocritical BUT that is not the case. Even with Kill la Kill's message of identity and not dictating based off appearance, the character designs standing alone tell a lot about the characters. It's borderline what you're required to do to achieve objectively good character designs.   \\n\r\nThe great direction and animation all leads to fairly simple but fantastic character designs. Not only do the Kamui have a layered message behind them but the complete conceptual juxtaposition between Ryuko and Satsuki is obvious. Ryuko looks rugged and has a more rogue like color scheme to fit her destructive rebellious personality while Satsuki has the clean blue and white and regal look. Long hair is also a lot more lady like than short. The designs almost epitomize the science of character design. Being creative but not assaulting the eyes with an overload of too many unique attributes that the design becomes forgettable. Mako is kept simple. To show she doesn't have the stand out flare of Ryuko and Satsuki. She's a poor girl, she doesn't have a place in society like Ryuko or Satsuki. Ryuko is a delinquent, Satsuki is a ruler, Mako has a very distinct look from the neck up but her clothes show she isn't like them, which is why when Ryuko treats her special, it does so much for her as a person. But also it's vice versa, Mako, treats Ryuko with the utmost love despite her being lower on the social spectrum. Mako may not stand out but Ryuko looks so highly of her because an individual that cares about a homeless punk like her, moves her to a drastic degree. The fact she's not being looked down on brings out that adorable Ryuko smile. \\n\r\nAlmost nothing about the designs are forgettable and since they're capable of telling you about the main characters you get near perfect lead models. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill may appear on it's surface to be a shallow anime but that's not the case. Due to the social stigma of fanservice and nudity. You can't understand everything based on appearance but Trigger still manages to keep that true to the show by making some greatly correlative designs. But just like the surface of Kill la Kill, not enough is revealed to understand everything. You gotta watch it for that. \\n\\n\r\nThese creators are hardened professionals at this point, they really went all out after they separated from Gainax. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill has a great soundtrack. Kill la Kill is not a hype show but IT IS a show that can keep you hyped. A hype show would depend on it's hype while Kill la Kill hooks you with so much more than just moments to excite you. \\n\r\nBut Trigger STILL wants to excite you and keep you invested 24/7. So it's music, voice actors, and sound direction are all marvelous. Great music pieces, never a poor performance, and excellent que. All with an exciting intro and calm ed to start up and sate your pumping blood. The music correlates to the characters as well of course. Granted not all the music is on the same level and Before my Body is Dry might play too much so a 10/10 music score is far too debatable to be warranted. \\n\\n\r\nFor example \"I want to know\" is an amazing song. It's perfectly fitting for the wedding scene. Clearly from the perspective of the person who loves Ryuko the most in the most intimate way. When Ryuko's fragile heart is broken, it's designed for the person reaching out for her. As the girl the song is from the perspective of begins and establishes the fact she hasn't been able to be there for her. And she regrets not being able to be there for her. Being able to talk to her. And mourns over the fact she can't justify it, that Ryuko has forgotten yesterday, and she wants to know if she still loves her. Ending the song on a \"but if you can\" note breaking the melancholy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I think characters like Mako, Satsuki, and Ryuko are completely 3 dimensional. I can't give it a 10 since a 10 would have better side characters or perhaps a sympathetic villain.\\n\\n\r\nRagyo and Nui Harime are objective villains, simply something for the heroes to overcome. They are truthfully bland. Ludicrously evil for the sake of being evil. No compelling philosophy or likable bone in their body. But they have a tie in the fascist/feminist/queer themes I will get to eventually. \\n\\n\r\nRyuko:\\n\r\nRyuko is a great lead. An emotionally introverted girl at first but she gradually begins to trust and open up again due to the fact she meets Mako and is forced to sync with someone fundamentally created to bond with her. Senketsu has her/her father's DNA which fulfills Ryuko's yearning for a father figure and is allegorically relating to how a father would cover their child to protect them. But Ryuko feels self doubt and loathing, and it worsens when Senketsu gets hurt protecting her. So she refuses to wear him in her lower points. \\n\r\nMako makes Ryuko feel loved in a different way. She stops being such an introvert because of it. She starts to lose the edge of not having family gave her. The father role is filled by Senketsu and the more intimate role is filled by Mako. Ryuko's proclaimed \"not being close to her father\" statement can easily make her revenge motivation feel flimsy but it COULD be a lie or because all Ryuko had was her dad, even if she had no meaningful relationship with him, they deprived her of all she knew was left that cared about her and started to bear a grudge. She wasn't strong enough to save her dad and she feels shame for that. She wants love and since she has had no outlet for it and has always been a troubled child who hates being thought less of (because to her no one has thought high of her ever) she becomes fiery when seen as lower. Which is why she admires Mako so much, Mako thinks highly of the delinquent girl. \\n\r\nSo when the system sees you as the lowest class you begin to hate and want to destroy the system. And since Ryuko is so reckless her only way of beating back the oppression is with brute force. You have to usurp the fascist because you can't talk one down. Ryuko even has vulgar and rude outbursts when force fed ideologies. She has no intention of of negotiation with someone she knows is in the wrong and looks at her as an inferior. Ryuko despite on surface level looking like a sex object is not any typical cliche depiction of a woman. She REFUSES to be a drone of the system. She doesn't give a damn about it's status quo. She still has more growth from that. \\n\r\nShe is initially ashamed of herself. She doesn't like when people look down on her so she can't fully sync up to her Kamui. She's ashamed of how people perceive her so she hides her true self. She's depressed and self loathing. She only shows her anger. She can't bring it all out. At this point she resents being looked down on and wearing a suit that looks like bondage wear in public makes her feel like she's being thought less of. Like she's being gawked at. But after a crude but meaningful speech from Mako and Satsuki's ideologies, she rises up and masters the God Robe. All while becoming more comfortable with her own personality. After all Satsuki say's so herself:\\n\\n\r\n\"The fact you feel embarrassed by the values of the masses only proves how insignificant you are!\"\\n\\n\r\nRyuko is hiding her true identity under her layers of shame. Shame much greater than the shame she felt of her body. But she finally becomes herself when exposed to real love and realizes that she is loved for who she is. It's even what saves her later on.\\n\r\nOver the course of the story she's gradually softening up and learning love. Fatherly and Romantically. When given the choice of pursuit of her motivation from Satsuki and the choice of Mako's happiness she takes brutal hits (despite being held back) from Mako. Because she couldn't choose for herself. Mako became more important to her than herself. After she finally develops these deep feelings, she realizes how easy and how much it hurts to lose than or the person you love. She doesn't want to lose her number 1. It hurts much more than when Isshin dies. Making her waver into her low point. Hiding her true self from the outside and doubting herself. Seeing how this initial simple journey has made her lose so much so many times. Wondering if she was even capable of a greater purpose anyway. Submitting to what society planned out for her. As she learns she was a weapon she begins to adopt the identity forced on her and that side is brought out by Junketsu. When Ryuko rediscovers her identity, she refuses what the society expected and wanted her to be in a different way than before. She even is the hand that destroys all those constructs just as her personality broke cliches to begin with. Very queer and feminist themes obviously. Having your identity strangled by social standards and being forced to hide yourself. But only achieving your true desires when you break away from the system and be yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMako:\\n\r\nMako is initially a social outcast. Her identity is considered unlikable by social standards. She underachieves, she's not very sharp, she's poor, loud, etc. But when Ryuko comes to the academy, she basically gets a second chance to finally have one friend. Luckily enough it's a girl who wants love and also doesn't fit the social standards. Someone who can understand her and someone she can finally dump her extroverted lovey personality on. They have such INCREDIBLE chemistry. She's not just a fun comic relief she's a fun comic relief with genuine depth as a character. \\n\r\nDespite being ditzy and clingy, Mako still has some wit and understands human emotion and constantly reinforces her love. Because if they are aware of her care they have more opportunity to stay with her. She understands her family and Ryuko have it rough. But they still fight, for a better world and because they care for one another. Ryuko begins to live for her so she begins to live for Ryuko. She is always loyal to and with Ryuko. \\n\r\nShe sees Ryuko as her knight in shining armor (which is great subversion as Ryuko isn't a man). Mako has never been protected and Ryuko has never had anyone to protect. Their friendship and intimacy deepens. As they finally have a person they can be themselves around. Even if society looks down on them, they pay no mind to it because they share so much love for each other. Mako has a love that is no longer familiar. And that she wants to protect it. So she despite being so animated and energetic grounds Ryuko. Subverting more tropes. The batty girl is the only one close and grounded enough to Ryuko to sate her unhinged personality. I applaud the writers as making 3 dimensional comic relief this memorable and even giving them a great arc is hard to pull off. \\n\r\nAlthough Mako decides she needs to contribute as Ryuko is the one doing all the hardwork. She co-finds the fight club as means to improve the life of all the people she cares about. But that submits to social standards of the oppressive society. Even if her family jumps in social class she starts to lose what she had before. Which was all she needed. And when she fights Ryuko she hates herself, and doesn't want to win. Neither of them want to win. Mako holds back but still attacks because she wants Ryuko to defeat her while Ryuko sandbags to get Mako to make the choice. \\n\r\nWhen Ryuko realizes Mako is holding back she drops her transformation. The side each other are fighting for compromises the other and it breaks their hearts. Mako finally breaks down crying and falls into Ryuko weeping. Questioning why no one is stopping her from hurting the person she loves most. Questioning why Ryuko would let her hurt her. She realized that the system just tore them all apart and she was heading back to a lonely life where no one loved her. She just wanted her family to have that sparkle. In this arc she has overcame the system. Any desire to rise higher than dirt was thrown from Mako. She'll take the poverty in exchange for Ryuko's love. Because keeping her original identity and her soul mate truthfully meant the most to her. \\n\\n\r\n\"Was the sparkle in your eyes just a gleaming glint of greed?!\"\\n\\n\r\nMako is then unbreakable in her feelings for Ryuko, eventually saving her twice. During her berserker transformation in which she jumps on Ryuko's boiling hot body to remind her of her identity and who loves that identity. Ryuko is a protector she's not fit to be some monster. And Mako shows her true feelings for her soft side and her rough side. Not an unhinged, abstract form of Ryuko's rage. Ryuko is loved completely by this person. She appreciates even her flaws. Which brings all of the broken pieces of Ryuko's heart back together. As she's pleading with her to stop being so self destructive. Mako also saves her during the wedding scene. I don't think I've seen a more intimate pair. When these characters struggle it's because they're trying to protect each other but in doing so, they take easy ways that separate them. It LITERALLY separates them. But when they're reminded of each other they have all the more motivation to fight. Learning that they have to stick to their guns, because there is no easy way. After so much build up, Mako finally asks Ryuko on a clearly romantic date and Ryuko agrees. Spitting in Ragyo's face in the finale and telling them she's not gonna miss that date. \\n\\n\r\nThey even find Satsuki along the way and make her feel like Ryuko's sister again.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki:\\n\r\nSatsuki Kiryuin is a woman who really wants to usurp the system she was forced to live into. She sees the kindness and humanity of Mako and Ryuko. She see their true strong identities. And starts to respect them. Making her smug smirks at Mako surpassing her desires and teaching Ryuko how not to be ashamed of her body. She stands her ground against her mother but finally tears the veil and tries to kill her when opportune. As she doesn't like the system no matter how deep her seemingly fascist ideals go. Her cracks in the facade do appear though with quotes that encourage the strength of those humans who challenge the system like herself. Despite her core personality juxtaposing Ryuko's they share that same feeling of wanting to destroy the system. While Ryuko's is more with anarchy, Satsuki's stab in the back is more political of a way to fight the construct of the system. \\n\r\nSatsuki also hates being degraded too. Challenging her abusive mother and staying in tact with herself despite Ragyo's attempts to feel vulnerable and impure. As Satsuki still believes in true human will power and strength. She unlike Ryuko though DEMANDS respect and get's it because of all of her mature and powerful attributes and great amount of self acceptance and understanding of her true identity.  \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kill la Kill at this point is it's side characters, while charismatic, are mostly 2 dimensional such as Gamagori and Mikisugi. They don't have enough to them. Also I covered what Senketsu symbolizes in Ryuko's portion. And he doesn't do much outside of being a guide/father figure. They are not bad characters. They just don't have the same level of personality depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe moment you have all been waiting for \\n\\n\r\nThe Mako/Ryuko Romantic dynamic\\n\\n\r\nMako and Ryuko have a deeply stemming, same sex, romantic relationship. They are very much so lovers and the date scene at the end of Kill la Kill isn't all that there is to back this borderline absolute up. The only thing keeping it from being 110 percent is the fact it's not directly stated. But to act as if it needs to be said is to say indirect characterization is invalidated because those attributes aren't directly stated either. They are a very complex pairing. Starting off as loners they compliment each other's personalities in a way where they are undeniably perfect for each other. Ryuko the rough, introverted, tomboy being loved by Mako the spry extroverted cheer leader. They are only hurt when their ties are compromised. When they're torn apart in some way. When losing it, Ryuko needs the reminder someone like Mako exists for her. \\n\r\nTheir relationship causes shifts in tone. The excited and bombastic presentation slows to a much more calm and passionate one. Giving us relaxing ideas and visuals. Always with a level of intimacy from Mako that is very much so tied down to reality. As we see how closely knit they are as a pairing. Their love is so authentic. This relationship in the series is so unique from the rest. While Senketsu and Ryuko have a strong bond, it isn't anything like this. Ryuko's bond with Senketsu is used in extremely excited moments and it's showing them bring out the best in eachother from what Senketsu has taught her. Meanwhile Mako brings out a different best in Ryuko. While Ryuko has moments where she hypes up her love for Mako, we're given these cathartic, romantic scenes. Everything from the lighting, dialogue,  direction, and pace of the scene is shifted. We understand that this is another relationship Mako is filling in for Ryuko. A romantic one, fulfilling Ryuko's heart. And as we see Ryuko lose herself we Mako is the only one who can touch Ryuko's heart as it falls apart. \\n\r\nIt's constantly shown that Mako is the only person who can snap Ryuko out of her crazed mental breaks. Even when Senketsu is free and Satsuki is aware of his sentience AND Senketsu is off Ryuko, Satsuki expresses her respect for Mako because she is the only person who can calm her down. Ryuko has her identity restored by Mako's love even when it's compromised by an outside source. Mako is the \"key to getting you (Ryuko) to relax\" and \"slows her heart rate\". There's a level of intimacy unmatched in this anime between the two. Beyond sisterly and beyond familiar. Senketsu and Ryuko have a deep bond but the dynamic is different. \\n\r\nAnd the wedding scene throughout this whole review is what I've foreshadowed the importance of.\\n\\n\r\nThe Wedding Scene and it's depth and correlation:\\n\\n\r\n\"If you kill Mako right here and now, that will hurt you most of all!\" \\n\\n\r\n3rd Wave feminism has quintessential relation to the female identity and incorporates heavy LGBT aspects into it's idea. Kill la Kill has themes, symbolism, and relationships that all fall into these theories of writing. All of which are very much so intentional. \\n\r\nSo when Ryuko has lost her identity and accepted the one Ragyo has assigned for her. She has lost herself and accepted the one people wanted her to have. She is dressed in her bridal dress and forced to marry someone she doesn't want to be with, to satisfy those who hate her real identity. Exactly like a closeted homosexual/woman who is oppressed by society would do. Until Mako comes in wearing Senketsu. \\n\r\nMako barges into Ryuko's heart wearing the groom suit and objects to the wedding. \"I want to know\" begins to play as we understand all of Mako's pain is laid out at the feet of Ryuko. Ryuko is marrying someone she truly can't love or be happy with out of conformity because she's lost her own identity and it's being suppressed. \\n\r\nLiterally out of any cliche \"I object to this marriage because I love her\" trope but made so much more special by everything about what led up to this and Ryuko/Mako's character dynamic.\\n\\n\r\n\"This isn't like you!\"\\n\r\n\"Kill me and give up on being MY Ryuko!\" - Mako\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding. Unlike Senketsu (who even LOOKS like Isshin) who was conditioned to understand Ryuko as he has her DNA, like a father who has a familiar bond with her daughter and is conditioned his whole life to comprehend her, Mako did it all on her own. She had to work for it. They weren't bodily built to get each other. They became devoted to each other through hardship and mutual feelings and it's what made them grow as people. \\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the groom suit is what protects Mako from Ryuko's blade. Because that suit in that moment is allegorical for her romantic love, and her devotion to give her life to and for the Ryuko she loves. And it reminded Ryuko she had someone like that to in-turn live for. She wanted to be the bride of that person. Not the one society set up for her to be with. Ryuko had finally found her real groom. \\n\r\nWhich stopped Mako and Ryuko from dying that day. And as Ryuko makes her decision \"I want to know\" ends and fades out. Ryuko leaves with her real groom afterward and realizes that conformity isn't worth ditching your lover and happy life for. A closeted and self loathing individual has finally accepted herself after she'd been broken and forced to get a taste of a life she wouldn't ever be happy in. She chose her individuality, the person with the most intimate love for her, and the one she loved most. She accepted her true feelings and would make Mako her purpose over being a will-less puppet of Ragyo and society, who simply wants her to drown in the system. \\n\\n\r\n\"she's just the type of woman who captivates your heart\" - Ryuko\\n\\n\r\nTo throw in a less dramatic lighter note; Mako's song \"light you up\" is incredibly endearing. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill and more 3rd Wave Feminism \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill looks like a very pandering anime. It comes off as something which would be treating women like sex objects all through it's run but it doesn't. The nudity subverts the male gaze, flipping it completely. As being \"nude\" empowers women to great lengths. It helps them embrace themselves, individuality, and their identity. Realizing their person isn't something to be ashamed of. Also it's hard to say all the girls are sex objects when basically the only 3 dimensional characters are the women. \\n\\n\r\nNot deep enough, my complaints:\\n\\n\r\nI find a lot of the obscure references in Kill la Kill to be a tad pointless. It hardly has any meaning and sometimes bears no correlation to the characters. Also I find Ragyo's rape of Satsuki to be very shallow. I understand it's meaning  and I don't dislike it because it takes me out of my comfort zone. It's just shallow symbolism. Almost pretentious. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I always try to stay objective, not subjective. I will never factor enjoyment into my review of a show but I'll say 10/10 out of appreciation for it's depth, my nostalgia, and because of how fun it is. It also has a LOT of rewatch value. Hopefully this review entertained you or provoked some sort of insightful thought. Or settled any doubts you had about the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a great show. Dynamic leads, rich symbolism, strong themes, excellent animation, music style, very empowering morals and a compelling romantic relationship. It's almost necessary to watch.",

            "content": "I usually have lower expectations from an action anime. Most of the times, since they cater to the Shonen audience, are a bit on the shallow side when it comes to plot and characters. Of course there have been quite a few exceptions like Hunter x Hunter, Black Lagoon etc. But on the other hand we also have stuff like JoJo's, Hellsing and Gurenn-Lagann which are all style and little substance (And I did enjoy them all thoroughly , don't get me wrong). \r\nKill la Kill is a delightful blend of the two sides of action anime - Style and Substance, in equal measure. Combinedwith its brisk pacing it was an exciting experience to watch no doubt. It does suffer from a slightly goofy pace at the start, but it sure escalates after a few episodes. It is rich with subversive themes about fashion, elitism, cultural domination, identity etc. all served with a double dose of fan service. The characters evolve fairly well over the episodes and they spend little time on angsty whingy moments which I absolutely love. Self-indulgent mopy protagonists have often been the bane of most action anime lately and this anime makes sure to avoid these trappings. The characters have been consistent and well polished as much as one can expect from a 24 episode show. The antagonists are pretty well developed (though certainly not Meruem good but then again understandable given the episode restriction). The plot does do well in tying up most of loose ends and ironing a few creases the show had at the start with regards to a few puzzling behavior of the characters. Humor was also well conceived and relatable ( this used to be the issue with most action anime) and also metaphoric in places\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this anime though is its awesome soundtrack. It adds much to the razzmatazz of the show and its characters. The antagonists's theme especially is epic ( and so are the lyrics since they say a lot about the character). It is not the anime with the best soundtrack ( Cowboy Bebop takes that place IMO) but it sure as hell is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the worst part about this anime is its awful art and animation. I do get what the studio was going for when the artwork for characters intended for comic relief was intentional and when the extras were all shown to be identical to imply that they were like sheep with no individuality. But apart from that, in most of the places the artwork was lackluster and left much to be desired. There were hardly any breathtaking or impressive scenes. Animation was subpar too especially given that its an action anime I naturally expected better sequences as against the repetitive and cluttered frames this show was filled with.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I'd definitely recommend this anime to anyone who wants a refreshing change from insufferable tropes of action genre of anime. This anime makes a deliberate conscious effort to transcend the familiar pitfalls of anime to provide the viewers with an entertaining brisk and thoroughly enjoyable visual fiesta\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around Ryuuko Matoi finding the Killer of her Father. In Kill l Kill there is alot of fights going on. The whole; clothing gives you power theme was quiet a creativ idea. There are some great Twits in here. I liked that the main cast consists of girls, which is a breath of fresh air. There is no limitation for what can happen in Kill la kill. The creators can do almost anything witch it.\r\nWhat i disliked was that the nudist beach guys played only a small role. which is dissapointing. Nowadays anime is really shit, but Kill la kill gaveme hope that anime can be great. kill la kill is in its own league. Revenge storys are nothing new but kill la kill executed it very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Killl la kill  shines. All characters are over the top crazy. Mako for instance is so hilarious and energetic. Satsuki is very discilpined and serious. Ryuuko is a strong female lead which i liked. My favorite is Gamagori. he was really cool to watch. They did a great job for making Nui dislikeable. I hate such loli characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimations: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Kill la Kill is at its best. The Animation is very fluid and over the top. There is lots happening in every scene. Backgrounds are very detailed and crisp. The visuals in fighting scnes are also very smooth and great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are some OST's that where  really memorable. OP was good and ED was okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is such a fun ride. it is over the top and has bombastic fight scenes. if you expect more than that you will get dissapointed. it is more of a rule of cool show. i enjoyed Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8/10",

I'm no expert of cinematography or music composition or stuff like that; there are other people who can make convincing arguments on why this show gets good grades in those areas and you can take those as you please.\r\nI rate stuff based on how it has affected me personally. In that regard, I can't deny that I spend A LOT of time thinking about this show and what it means to me. Every couple of months, I go into this phase where I start thinking about it again, which inevitably leads to me re-watching it, and then discovering even morecool things to think about and how they resonate with me and my worldview. I suppose that means I think this show is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nIn all my life, I have only ever had that feeling with a couple of video games; this is the only anime to ever give me such a feeling, which I suppose makes it my favorite. I also have never had a feeling stronger than what those games and this show have given me. Therefore, in my experience so far, said feeling is the highest possible achievement a piece of media can accomplish in my subjective measurement, which makes this show a 10/10 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this show doesn't resonate on the same level for everybody. This sometimes makes me wonder if its themes weren't as powerful and well-delivered as I had perceived them to be. Although I think it might mainly be a matter of how, as the show itself celebrates, other people are unique individuals, separate from my own person.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show for more reasons than I could plausibly bother to list; I love watching it and I love thinking about it.\\n\r\nMaybe you will too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, if it doesn't immediately resonate with you but you want to begin to understand my perspective anyway, then I would start you out with the hint to pay attention to the motif of dualism (ex: nudity vs. clothing) in the shows components, as almost everything stems from that motif.

The action is fairly constant, but the story builds throughout the season. There are serveral twists and turns along the way, and it all leads to a climactic finale.\r\nThe way they make it look like an old-school kung fu movie is really cool. They use the perfect fonts at the perfect times to describe many things throughout the season.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are in the mood for kung-fu style of action with a lot of bizarre moments.\r\nYou might not like itif: Skimpy outfits and a lot of skin makes you squeamish.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: There is reasoning behind Ryuuko\u2019s uniform, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nEXPANDED REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nOur anime group, Salt Lake City (SLC) Anime, reviewed Kill la Kill this month and here is what the group thought:\\n\\n\r\nThere was a strong liking or disliking for Kill la Kill, based on the person. Some group members found the anime to be exciting and unique. They found it to be bizarre in many ways and found it refreshing that it did not seem like an anime that had already been seen a hundred times already.\\n\\n\r\nSome members did not like Kill la Kill because they found it distasteful or as something that did not fit their tastes, such as the style of humor that they enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nThe mother (nemesis of the story) was found to be one-dimensional and not a very convincing villian. There was a lot of characters, but time was put into the characters so that the audience grows an attachment to them. There\u2019s character development for a lot of the characters, and they have unique personalities that are quite memorable.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed Kill la Kill because of its bizarre nature and unique attributes to its storyline and humor. I would recommend it.",

The story and plot twists kept me wanting more. I fell in love with most of the major characters and their appropriate voice actors. The animation was unique and had a nice and colorful charm to it. And the music kept the epic moments in the anime to a maximum.\r\nStory: (7/10)\r\nThe story would have been perfect if it wasn't for the filler at the beginning of the season. The first 8 episodes slowly introduce plot points but doesn't reflecthow the show is in the later portion. But if you can look past that then just try to get to the point after as the show starts to take itself very seriously and really develops unique action-packed comedy that is Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of the story revolves around clothing and \"life fibres\" that affect humans and are utilized for their power to give people super human strength. Although the plot gets even stranger and more ridiculous as time goes on and some people think of this as satire, I beleive Kill la Kill takes itself very seriously and doesn't allow the absurdity of the plot take away from the experience. Kill la Kill ends up to be more spoiler heavy than most series and the few plot twists that exist keep grabbing more and more of my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\r\nWho needs character development? Although many of the characters never changed or develop throughout the anime, the show instead lets the viewer learn more about the characters as they reveal more of their personality and views. Kill la Kill ends up proving that character development isn't essential to making amazing characters. Every character in this anime is wonderfully unique. Each character represents a strong and exaggerated personality that best suits them and no-one else. Many characters have gags to them that never go out of style and avoid being overused. If I didn't care to have a unique favorite characters section I would favorite most of the characters in Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's best friend Mako Mankanshoku, is just a bundle of happiness and energy and she's always there to bring the comedy and support Ryuuko. Ira Gamagoori is the biggest strongarm with a very dominant yelling personality. He's honorable and even has soft spot that really makes him a lovable character. And then there's Nui Harime, the biggest psychopathic pretty princess out there. Viewers either hate for her bitchiness or love her for her evil adorableness.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation and art gives the show a refreshing uniqueness from regular anime. Every non-standard Goku uniform made for each character is unique. In the beginning of the anime, many of Ryuuko's enemies have ridiculous and over exaggerated animations but that happens less often as the anime progresses. Many people in Kill la Kill even have their own animation style. Mako for instance has very little animation during her rants to seem like she's full of energy and jumping all over the place. Ira Gamagoori's physical size seems to not have a solid scale compared to other people. His face and stare just tear through your soul in the most menacing ways. And Nui Harime, because she's a psychopath and takes nothing seriously her combat animations are often smooth rotations of the arms without any flexing. It fits her perfectly and shows she's a force to be reckoned with.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the Ecchiness: Yes Kill la Kill is ecchi, however, it doesn't flaunt that it as it's primary selling point like most ecchi anime. This is an anime about clothing and fighting the power of uniforms, so they will get ripped off but ecchiness is never used in those instances. Ryuuko's uniform is an impressive combination of sexy and badass and it's the first time I'd consider buying a sexy anime figurine of something without being embarrassed. Due to the ecchiness in the anime there are some perverts but the perverted nature of the characters starts to go away after the story gets serious. Yes there are quite a few ass shots in Kill la Kill so if this bothers you greatly then this anime may not be for you. All in all the ecchiness never ruins any of the action scenes and flows nicely with the anime. I think it slightly added to the anime but others who don't like it may disagree.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nKill la Kill has an impressive and skilled roster of English voice actors to represent each character. Every voice actor matches their character perfectly (Although I've heard Uzu Sanageyama's Japanese voice actor was a much better match for the him). There is also an impressive soundtrack to Kill la Kill. Many characters have their own themes and many of the songs make for impressive battle music. Kill la Kill would not have been the same without the epic music that brought it to life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nThis would have been a perfect 10 if the filler episodes at the beginning weren\u2019t so repetitive. Overall I greatly enjoyed Kill la Kill. Once I was hooked I couldn\u2019t stop.\\n",

The first twelve episodes were fine to me, the characters were fairly likable and the story was decent. Around episode 14 the story gets so convoluted and just plain stupid. I'm sorry, but I'm not that impressed. The best part of this anime is that the action makes up for the story being ridiculous. \r\nMy favorite character is Mako, and if you haven't watched it yet that doesn't help you much. She's a support character that's best friends to the main. Her dialogue during serious(ly stupid) scenes made the show more bearable for me towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating for the show is a 6. It could have been a 7 or 8 if the story wasn't just so stupid; I literally lost some brain cells thinking about the plot. Sheesh. I recommend watching this for plain enjoyment and for actions scenes. DO NOT watch this for a good story. If you're reading this and already saw the show and honestly thought it was good, I'm sorry, but you really need to watch better anime.",

I attempted to watch KLK (Kill La Kill) several times before actually finishing the series. But once you get passed the artwork you will find yourself captivated watching episode after episode with few to no breaks. \r\nThe soundtrack to the anime was phenomenal and really complimented each scene whether it was action or emotional. However it seemed very limited due to the repetition of each soundtrack. \r\nThe anime is also surprisingly very humorous due to a select few characters which also brings me to my next topic; character development. The character developmentis very good as the author makes the watchers build that bond with each character making them unforgettable. \\n\r\nIn conclusion, i highly recommend watching KLK and never to judge an anime by its cover, just give it a go and it may just end up being one of your favourite anime afterwards.",

            "content": "I was pretty unimpressed by the idea of Kill la Kill before it came out, I'm a pretty big Gainax fan, so I thought this might just be riding on the coat tails of Gurren Lagaan and Panty and Stocking. I mean, fan service as a plot line? I want to imagine I'm better than that, and also buff and rich, but eventually my curiosity got the better of me. Thank fuck it did, this show is incredible.\r\nIt starts off as the most generic \"girl goes to new school and student body president doesn't like her\" vibe, but not even half way through the firstepisode, it starts to diverge from that at breakneck speed. Enter a really heavy 1984 undertone to the school discipline system, and a sentient self described \"skanky sailor uniform\" that pretty much gives you super powers. Now add a dash of \"revenge for killing my dad\", and suddenly you've got an interesting plot. Okay, I'll admit it, the level of fan service in this is astounding. It's written into crucial parts of the plot. It becomes the plot. But here's where it gets strange, the protagonist Ryuko starts off disgusted and embarrassed by her \"uniform\", who can talk, but grows to see her own weakness as a strength and her clothes become her friend. I know, that sounds incredibly stupid, I thought it would be too, but the growth of Ryuko and her uniform Senketsu tugs you right in the heartstrings. This totally got me, and as soon as that clicked, I barely even noticed the fan service (which is pretty impressive because by the end, I'm pretty sure no one has clothes - it makes sense, just go with it). This is one of the fastest moving shows I've seen in the past decade, the recap episode being the opening of a real episode should say enough. You won't have time to get bored because this is pure killer no filler, but don't mistake it for some dumb beefhead fight show, when it wants to make you sad oh boy will it drop a boulder on your nads. Be prepared to laugh, to cry, and to shudder at the start while you get over the fan service torrent.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes in this show are perfection. Everything is cranked up to 11, and it keeps escalating as the stakes get higher. If Ryuko can beat student body president Satsuki's 4 best warriors, she will tell her what happened to her father and grant her the revenge she seeks. Not to spoil anything, but this is the halfway through the show climax, I'm not even going to get into the second half. Just know that Ryuko is a very well fleshed out character (sorry), all clothes are evil, and Satsuki's mom won't be winning mother of the year award any time soon (ugh so sorry). The smaller storylines all merge together quite nicely and the finale is so satisfying it almost makes me want to buy the show as it is, in 3 DVD sets that cost as much as a three weeks food budget. The music is phenomenal, never missing an opportunity to get the most out of a full orchestra when the action reaches its crescendo (sorry again). The english dub is fantastic, especially the discipline officer Gamagori. Just remember, this show was made on a shoestring budget and now it's building a new great wall with gold bars.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is You love this show, you just don't know it yet.",

            "content": "5th review enjoy.\r\nJudged it at first sight.....Blew my mind once i gave it a chance but its definitely not for everyone.\r\nStory- I really enjoyed the story though it kinda seemed all over place for like the first half of the show a certain character comes in and you realize why all the weird stuff is happening and how powerful and what the clothes actually mean in the show. The comedy was like 50/50 sometimes it was funny as heck and then other times it was not really funny. The story like i said is kinda all over the place its just really wacky and afteryou get through like 20% of the show you will find yourself wanting more and keep watching mainly because of how wacky it is. The ecchi scenes dont get in the way of the story to add on. Had a pretty decent ending to add on.\\n\\n\r\nArt- the art wasnt a beautiful peace of work it kinda had its own personal style it was kinda weird looking but it really matched with how weird the show was the fighting scenes really showed off the art to the show they looked really well done  and just kept your eyes zoomed in amongst every major fight. the character designs for the main characters were really well done quite unique maybe not at first but once the change happens which you will notice not gonna spoil it so thats all you get. \\n\\n\r\nsound- one of my favourite soundtracks like ever in anime \"Before my Body is dry\", Blumenkranz, Ad ra Lib, Demon dragon G... Just a few of the amazing soundtrack it goes well with the characters and with the time and what they are doing in a certain scene for example a really cool fight and then \"Before my Body is dry\" hits and then you get sunken into the fight scenes the music has a great effect on the show itself.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter- Love all the characters from the main character Ryuuko Matoi to the supporting characters. Ryuuko is just a really cool chick whos after revenge and she finds herself in problems and attempts to overcome them she loses herself and her character completely changes once a determined person to a lost person, Mako and Makanshoku the source of comedy throughout the show although her family is kinda 50/50 with the comedy i always thought Mako was always on point with the jokes the sudden cameos the weird appearances. I could go on but from protagonist to antagonist all the characters you will be interested in for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- amazing loved it couldn't get enough, enough said\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9/10 would watch again, Not a show for everyone but if you like the weirder side of anime or the action side sprinkled with comedy and a quite a bit of ecchi mixed with a awesome soundtrack then give it a watch if not then just broaden your spectrum and you will either be amazed or meh about it.\\n\\n\r\n I think its super awesome and thus the high overall but most of the anime i watch are usually the ones that arent really bad so for now alot of my reviews are just gonna be on the good stuff since i dont really have an issue with alot of the anime i watch",

            "content": "Kill la Kill (From Creaters of Gurren Lagann) was a show that when everyone watched the first episode, most people immediately turned it down because of the fan service. I was more in the \"What the fuck\" is happening mood during and after the first episode. Though, the more I watched the show, the more addicted I got to it. It gets more enjoyable at the minute every new episode was aired or released. Studio Trigger hit home run gold with this anime as the media blew up when released and I can't wait to see what they do to stretch this hype train evenfurther.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nThe story was pretty good! The story was both hilarious, intense, and sometimes confusing! The story of clothes is pretty much to describe this show! The show begins with main character Ryuko Matoi's main objective,to find who killed her dad and took half of the famous weapon, the scissor blade! As she visit her home to see her dad impaled and dead, she ran outside to see a silhouette figure jumping away with the other half of the blade. It may look obvious at first, but don't believe what you see at first glance...I would continue more but I dont want to spoil it for everyone!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 \\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, and the 3D action scenes were pretty well designed too. Though there was too much fan service. Now I mean a little fan service isn't going to hurt me, but if it's in every episode, man it's like shoving it down my throat. Again i'm not bagging on fan service, it's just there was a little too much, but still, I enjoyed the series nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was amazing! The Kill la Kill Soundtracks from the epic fight scenes to the main and popular \"DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY\" The soundtrack had me listening to it for days. I was listening to Before My Body Is Dry along with the opening and ending for awhile!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nOk, how is it not possible for me to not give a 10 for these awesome characters. The cast I should say was enormous! About 10+ characters were revealed only in the first episode, though these characters is what made this show one of the best. The characters go from many different perspectives from cheerful to serious to flat-out sexual and even the couple annoying characters you just wanted to punch in the face or tear your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment out of this show was through the roof for me! This show easily moved it's way to the top of my anime list, even past my all time favorite Soul Eater, and reached number 1. Like I said before, Studio Trigger had reached gold with this show. I believe and most others believed as well, if Studio Trigger messed this up, how would they recover from it all? Luckily, that never happened!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI give this show a overall 10 and no better way to say it, but Studio Trigger defiantly didn't \"lose their way\" with this one....heh heh heh...heh...heeeeeeeeeeeeh",

Even with its similarities its still very good and worth your time.\r\nIts not deep, but still very interesting. It made me wonder \"Where could they be going with this?\" and the way it plays out is so unpredictable and exciting, its unbelievable.\r\nThere were some things that came up like things that happened as it was convenient to the protagonist but its notbig.\\n\r\nMost of the series is pretty much episodic until the last ones, but even being episodic they definitely are worth watching and only few could be labeled as filler.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nFrom what I know, the artists who did TTGL brought over the same art style to studio TRIGGER.\\n\r\nIt was lacking sometimes, like lines over something else or whatever, but its still very good.

Even without that its really cool.\\n\r\nReally liked the opening animations.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs very well done and get you in the right mood for watching this show.\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are really fitting of the art and plot, cinematic and fast-paced. They have recognizable tones that are outstandingly in sync with the plot.\\n\r\nThe antagonists tracks are very exciting too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n(Main Protagonist) Ryuuko is somewhat deep but at least not shallow. Likeable and straightforward. Has her ups and downs. Her actions are clearly effected by changes within herself throughout the series.\\n\r\nThe all-lovable Mato is irritatingly indescribable. Well, Mato is Mato.\\n\r\nShe does play important roles and stuff but she is a little shallow and uninteresting at times. But her roles go by quickly, so there is not too much loss if you're not interested in her parts.\\n\r\nThe antagonists are interesting, but only later on. But much more info would be a spoiler to the plot.\\n\r\nNone of the characters are wusses like many protagonists these days. I am fucking tired of that. :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nNot everyone can love Kill la Kill. Its not romance. Not comedy, but has some funny moments.\\n\r\nIt has a lot of things to point out though.\\n\r\nShows some things about bonds and friendship.\\n\r\nOften times, it becomes pretty light-hearted. Usually if the protagonists aren't around the antagonists.\\n\r\nLots of blood, but not like crazy over it. If you get queasy from blood, you will probably be okay. I'm the same way. \\n\r\nAt the same time I say not everyone can enjoy this, I will still recommend this to people who may lot be interested in something like this. Because Kill la Kill is pretty unique among all the action shows. It definitely stands out.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show.\\n\r\nI laughed, got emotional, flipped my keyboard, couldn't stop watching, and added it to my favorites. Its definitely a memorable show that is worth every moment of its 24 minute episodes.\\n\r\nEven if you don't think you will enjoy it, I think you should give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nI think I will be expecting some cool releases from this studio later on while I check out their other shows. I hope my review was helpful to you.\\n\\n\r\n\"t-t-that was my f-first review. You had better be grateful.\"",

            "content": "\"One question I ask people allot is why they watch anime. For me it\u2019s butterflies. When a really good series ends I have this amazing sensation of butterflies in my stomach. I would give anything to feel that feeling. Sadly it happens the. first time I watch a series and only then. Butterflies are why I still watch anime. I need to find more. I watch allot of things that don\u2019t deliver them but are still enjoyable. Butterflies are a criteria on my top list but sometimes an anime has toast problems for it to make it despite having them.\"\nKill la Kill is disappointing becausefor how amazing of an experience it was I can\u2019t recommend it to anyone, much less talk about it. It\u2019s pedigree and style lend it to be on par with tengen toppa guren lagann. However it is not as complex as ttgl and falls short story wise. The amount of fan service is somewhat revolting, and yet it\u2019s the most exciting anime this year. Kill la Kill makes me hate how much I love it.\\n\\n\nKill la kill is the next anime created by the people behind Ttgl. As expected it has a very similar style. The pacing is as fast as it can be driving the plot where it needs to go. The action is over the top to match. All of the pieces are there to have a wicked time no matter what happens. Kill la kill amps up its audiences to a point that\u2019s well worth the price of admission.\\n\\n\nWhile it may be a successor to ttgl it does have some shortcomings. Ttgl had a theme of believing you can do anything and then achieving it. Kill la kills theme is somewhat muddled. The story is so ridiculous that it feels like a story about making friends with your clothes. There are plenty of sub themes that are more traditional but throughout the series the only consistent themes are too ridiculous to be take seriously. I walked away from ttgl inspired. Kill la kill can\u2019t inspire anyone.\\n\\n\nThe driving force behind this confusion is the premise. Kill la kill is literally about clothing with superpowers and harassers interacting with it. Allot of kill la kill\u2019s story seems to come from the origins of needing an excuse to draw sexy things. Characters gain power by wearing skimpier clothing is just one example. There were a number of scenes that seemed like they were lifted from a hentai. Were the show less fun I would have stopped watching because certain scene were just uncomfortable.\\n\\n\nThe biggest piece that kept me going was the soundtrack. Kill la kills soundtrack had the perfect song for every situation. I have never encountered more fitting music in anime. The credits made me have to see the next episode. Without cliffhangers or even an interesting episode ending, kill la kill\u2019s credits made me desire more.\\n\\n\nKill la kill is ultimately a series that can\u2019t be explained. On paper it sound like the most ridiculous waste of time since the virtual boy. But for those who are willing to watch it, it\u2019s a thrill ride that they can\u2019t explain or admit to watching to non-otakus.",

            "content": "Ah yes, Kill la Kill, perhaps one of the most controversial fall anime of the 2013 line-up. Most think Kill la Kill is entirely fanservice, which is not true; the fanservice is there, yes, but its part of the show which makes it its own.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nKill la Kill is about a girl named Ryuuko Matoi who is seeking retribution for her father who she found murdered. Ryuuko happens upon Honnouji Academy, an incredibly strict and over the top school run by the somewhat \"evil dictator\" Satsuki Kiryuin. These two girls form the basis of the story of Kill la Kill, along with the overally zealousMako Makanshou. The story of Kill la Kill changes so much along the way, each episode feels as if its the finale. There are many twists and turns during the course of Kill la Kill's story, that sometimes you do not see the surprises coming your way. Sometimes the story does move fast at points, causing it to feel a bit rushed. Overall, the story of Kill la Kill is original and changes so much from its main plot, that you do not know what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kill la Kill is definitely Trigger-esque, which is some of the best of its kind. Its almost like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann and Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt were mashed together, and out came Kill la Kill. Each character looks unique and stylish, which is not seen in most animes. While the main art of Kill la Kill is unique and beautiful, there is also the talked about \"fanservice\". Most think the fanservice of Kill la Kill is stupid and what defines it, but I view it as typical Trigger fanservice. Trigger is well known for going ridiculous with its art, which is nothing new. So, I say, the art of Kill la Kill is fantastic, and yes it does offer fanservice, but it is entirely original of Trigger Studios.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Kill la Kill is absolutely fantastic. Ryuuko's main theme is harsh and gritty, while Satsuki's sounds almost like a dictator's theme. The sound blends in well with the action of the show, and what is going on in that moment. It makes the person watching the show feel moved as to what is going on; whether it is a fight scene, or an emotional moment, you feel moved and involved with the show. The OST of Kill la Kill is definitely memorable, as there are so many different sounds that evoke different emotions. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kill la Kill are definitely some that are quite memorable. Ryuuko starts off as somewhat simple-minded; she is only looking for the person who killed her father, and will get to it no matter what. Yet, at the end, she is changed into someone who cares about not only the people around her, but herself. The same goes for Satsuki, who is viewed throughout the most half of the show as cold, calculating, and harsh. Satsuki undergoes quite a change in the show, becoming a beautiful, smart, and overall nice person. I view Satsuki as having most of the character development in the show, which is fantastic. As well with other characters, such as Mako, the Elite Four, and the Nudists, they all get their screentime, but not enough character development. Side characters such as the ones mentioned, do not get enough explained on them, nor enough screentime to do it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you ignore what people say about this show and just watch it for your own enjoyment, you will definitely have a great time enjoying Kill la Kill. Kill la Kill, I believe, is meant to take you on a ride that will change you by the end. It opened my eyes to the bigger picture of the show in itself. Kill la Kill, like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann I believe, is supposed to involve the viewer with the show and make them feel as if they are part of the action and the emotions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill la Kill is a great, misunderstood show. This show will make you laugh, cry, mad, and go through all the emotions over and over again. Kill la Kill was a great experience for me, as it was for many other people. The action and characters of Kill la Kill will definitely impact your life; they are the kind that make you care about them. Kill la Kill is definitely a show that you must watch before you die.",

            "content": "My first review on MAL. I wrote it quick based off a bullet list i created while watching the show over time. Anyway, enjoy.\r\nHell Yes!\r\nKill la Kill is great. No, its so much more than that, its damn near perfect. It hits all of the right notes and then takes those notes and turns them into something more exciting than basic piano chords. Something more like a piano beating up Bach because he's trying to take over the universe with his clothes. Let that sink in.\r\nEverything is over the top, and it is so awesome.\r\nAlways Moving\r\nThe story of Kill La Kill is simple. A highschool girl named Ryuko(Ryuuko) Matoi enrolls in Honnouji Academy in order to find more about her dads killer, and then proceed with taking revenge on said person. The story seems straight forward but in true Gainax tradition there is a fair share of revelation to be dropped, but one of the fun things about this show is the fact that they drop so much and with such finesse that even if your expecting it, your going to be wrong about it. There's a lot to take in but the show pulls it off without much of a problem at all because it explains the plot as it gives it. By doing this you wont rack your brain about stuff that happened in previous episodes because its already explained, freeing the viewer to focus on the now of the show. Hell it even did its recap in a couple of seconds whereas most anime take an episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nEven though the plot moves fast, it somehow makes time to give most of the side characters some type of backstory. The characters who more or less only appear in a couple of episodes get some type of backstory. This is great because most of the characters are so unique that they beg for character development anyway. From the light hearted Mako to the powerful Satsuki these characters will make you laugh, cry, and shout without a moments hesitation, and that is when Kill La Kill gets awesome.\\n\\n\r\nA highlight of the show is the interaction between Matoi and her friends. These scenes are some of the more heart tugging moments of the series. The same goes with the interaction between Satsuki and her subordinates.\\n\\n\r\nGleefully Over The Top\\n\r\nOver the top does not even begin to describe how crazy this show is. It takes the Magical Girl genre and amplifies it into something that completely defies logic while staying within the realm of believable. See the amazing this is not that it is so over the top, its the fact that it can be so over the top and still feel believable within the world that it is based in. For example, there is a faction in the show called the Nudist Beach who only wears light beams over their privates as protection, and they never feel unbelievable. Fanserve is a plot point in this anime and save a few weird scenes, it is done better than most other shows. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of other fan service too, like callbacks to shows like Gurren Laggan and Evangelion. It also calls back to western culture a lot too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOverall, Kill La Kill is perfect save from a few questionable scenes involving the fanservice. Its fast paced, action packed, side splitting funny, and completely over the top take on the Magical Girl genre and should not be missed at all if your a fan of anime. \\n\\n\r\n9.8 Out of 10\\n\\n\r\nThings worth touching on\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of Kill La Kill is iffy, its for the most part great but sometimes it can dip.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it may make you feel weird, but thats ok.\\n\\n\r\nDat OST",

            "content": "\"The world is not a piece of cloth, it is full of incomprehensible things\" - Kiryuin Satsuki\r\nKill la Kill was produced by Trigger, that was founded by former Gainax staff members. In fact, this anime is one of the 2-cour fall anime that I have watched.\r\nSTORY (8):\r\nThe story takes place in Honnouji Academy where students possess uniforms that give them various powers and abilities. The place was run by Kiryuin Satsuki and it's all up to Matou Ryuuko to stop her. \r\nThe story is captivating in the sense that it has awesome action scenes. However, it didn't make my heart pump fast.\r\nIn fact, to meI know that most people will not like this anime because of the illogical fanservice. However, I didn't mind that, as long as the fanservice is not the main focus of the show. I would deem the fanservice illogical if the fanservice is the main focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also said some memorable quotes like \"Nudist Beach\", \"La vie est just drole\". However, the most memorable quotes are from Kiryuin Satsuki. She said \"People do not live for the sake of clothing\".\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you that don't know the meaning of \"La vie est just drole\", it means \"Life is funny\".\\n\\n\r\nART (6):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation took quite a while for me to get used to because the outline of the animation looks filmsy and awkward. The animation looks like a combination of Gurren Lagann and FLCL. The director of those anime is Hiroyuki Imaishi.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe only music I loved was Ragyou's theme \"Blumenkranz\". It has a catchy and addictive rhythm. The music shows power and glory. I am all right with the opening and ending songs. Right now, the song that grew to me was the 2nd opening \"ambiguous\" by Garnidelia and also the 1st opening \"Sorry, I'm done being a good kid\" by Miku Sawai. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (7):\\n\\n\r\nI am fine with the characters. They never stand out to me with the exception of Matou Ryuuko & Kiryuin Satsuki. \\n\\n\r\nKiryuin Satsuki is the best character in this anime. She really takes pride in what she does and she has a bright vision and goal. In fact, she is an anti-hero. She wasn't bad for the sake of being bad. She just wants to protect the world. Not to mention, she is a badass.\\n\\n\r\nMatou Ryuuko is also badass just like Kiryuin Satsuki. She wears Senketsu which is her battle armor that gives her strength and power in exchange for her blood.\\n\\n\r\nMankanshoku Mako was annoying because all the time she gets kidnapped and she requires Ryuuko to save her. However, in the later episodes, she tries to help her which takes serious bravery. She showed some character development.\\n\\n\r\nKiryuin Ragyou looks quite intimidating but not so intimidating to the point where I fear for her in my sleep.\\n\\n\r\nHarime Nui was cute but she could also be very sneaky and cunning even when it comes to infiltrating Honnouji Academy.\\n\\n\r\nI also wished that some of the side characters like Mako's siblings and parents especially Aikuro who is Ryuuko's teacher had some character development so that I really can connect well with them.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (7):\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime however, this anime didn't surprise me one bit. In fact, I did appreciate the way how they make clothing a sense of power. For example, different clothing is grouped into different classes. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy Ragyou's theme song \"Blumenkranz\". However, that's pretty much it. I guess there's nothing to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like action, and if you don't mind the fanservice. You would enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, I would give it a 7 out of 10. It was fun while it lasted.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kill La Kill took me by surprise.  I never thought I'd actually enjoy it as much as I did, much less actually finish the series.\r\nTo start off, I don't care for fan service, I can't appreciate non-nonsensical shows that are wacky but have no plot or depth, and fast-paced shows and style only gets you so far before it gets old.  KLK ended up defying most of my pre-judgements.\r\nI watched the first 6 episodes and I abandoned the series, writing it off as idiotic and fan service-y, almost like it's trying to compete with Highschool of the Dead with FLCL and Gurren Lagaanelements (which makes sense). I picked it back up because I kept hearing buzz that it was better than that and gave it another shot.\\n\r\nSomething that I ended up actually appreciating is that it never stops being what it's trying to be.  It doesn't use the lightning-fast pacing, gratuitous fan service, and over-exaggerated styling only in the first half to reel you in then stops.  In fact, I got used to it and enjoyed how they implemented it.  It knows what kind of show it's going to be from beginning to end and uses those elements to draw you into the characters and story.\\n\r\nBreaking down my ratings-\\n\r\nStory: I would give it a 9 if it had gave a little more to the viewers in the first half to draw you in.  The mysteries of Ryuko, her blade, and her Kamui are not well fleshed out enough to keep casual viewers interested until several episodes in.  Once you start getting half way in though, the story unravels and takes in several different directions and does a decent job explaining why.  You can actually go back and re-watch episodes and you'll catch the subtleties, it's a nice touch.  It ends in a way that it wraps up loose ends and doesn't really have you clamoring for a continuation.\\n\r\nArt: I love the over-the-top style, I didn't have problems with rough and sketchy art, but I had a problem with constantly re-using the stock footage of transformation sequences.  Then again, I'm also not a huge fan of magical girl shows for that reason.  Furthermore, some of the fight scenes were very lazily drawn; if I want to see two people duking it out in what's supposed to be a pretty climactic battle, it shouldn't be animated with a lazy blur of arms and re-used animations.  Worse yet, this is done more than a few couples throughout the series.  It just seems a lazy.\\n\r\nSound: Music fit very well, the voice actors were chosen perfectly, and the ambient atmospheric noises were well done too. Not much else there.\\n\r\nCharacters: There were very few characters I didn't care for by the end of the show.  They made sure most of the characters had more than one appearance and be more than just a ridiculous blip on the radar.  The character back stories were fleshed out just enough that you got only what you really needed to know and refrained from showing extra information that didn't serve any purpose.  Don't look for a super deep backstory but again this show doesn't waste time by throwing in superficial details.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's hard to take your eyes off the show even for a few seconds because you'll miss something.  I re-watched the show almost right away to see if I missed anything.  I was pleasantly surprised the show could have an ending that I really not only didn't expect but was also satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I highly recommend this show and to give it a chance.  It dares to do things differently but you need some patience and not get too wrapped up in the silly details (such as the fan service).  It's not often that you see many original anime shows that have no manga it's based off of that actually has great talent behind it and also doesn't try obviously milking the audience for what it's worth, whether in merchandising or franchising.",

            "content": "This anime has it's own unique features unlike others. The outstanding atmosphere I feel while watching it through till the end. This anime might be more educational then you might think, if do not know, this anime is base off from the hardships of woman during development. \r\nStory (10/10): Ryuko Matoi, a transfer student to a new school that is known for its system, she has only 1 goal in the beginning, finding who killed her father. Matoi fights through against people to find out the truth, once she knows the truth her hatred consumes her. She was striking for vengeance, but then she changeslater on into something better. The Story is very interesting, give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): The Art is decent, not the best but pretty decent, I realize why they choose this kind of art due to the anime's comedic and action scenes, there is a lot of blood, but the art makes it look like something else so we won't get disgusted by it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10): Each and every character has a very interesting back story, side characters or main characters. They have their stories and they carefully mention it in some episodes, is not time consuming, is quite short but very informative so you can get what kind of nature and behavior of each character. There are some back stories, but is not a waste of time, you might actually want to know more once you're done with the back stories of each character. Matoi has delinquent nature, while Satsuki has a discipline and well organized nature. Watch it to know more.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10): The Soundtrack and the music, I believe a good anime must have a good soundtrack, maybe except for comedy anime. The songs and the soundtrack of Kill La Kill is very deep and strong, it controls the atmosphere very well and also in outstanding sync with the characters and the scene.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10): The well sync elements of this anime is well, and carefully put together that makes this anime awesome. For my enjoyment at least, everyone has their opinions, and haters will always be there to give anything a bad taste, but I believe if you're mature enough to handle the jokes, scenes, fan service and the intense atmosphere that is on spar with attack on titan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10): Give this anime a go! All you haters on woman, watching this might change you and help you learn how to respect. I believe every anime has it's purposes and in the ending it will teach you something well. Especially this anime, I might be making this anime sound weird and kinda educational but everything is educational, even CoD, Kill La Kill is intense, fighting, deep influence anime. WATCH IT.",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 9\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nRight. Let's talk about Kill la Kill. If there's one show out there that will proudly take the title of 'Extravagant Craziness', then this show will do just that and display it in a blinding beacon for the whole world to see; while being bare-naked in fact! Or to put it another way, it's basically an extraordinary trip through everything that you can find in an action anime.\r\nMy reaction, or set of reactions I should say, from the first episode can be extended throughout the whole show. That one single episode is honestly enough tooutline what Kill la Kill's explosive entertainment is all about: a condensation of bewildering, eccentric, exciting, loud, crazy, eroticized, flashy, and wacky qualities. And there are 24 episodes of that. I think it's easy to visualize just how wild of a ride this was.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without further ado...\\n\\n\r\nEnter Honnouji Academy! One crazy school where powerful clothes decide your social hierarchy and shouting like a maniac is everyone's favorite pastime. You can find a nudist teacher who has nipples that glow a purplish pride, all kinds of not-so-normal clubs, and a strong student council called the Elite Four that's led by an even more strong girl named Satsuki here. Yeah, a pretty weird school to be enrolled to but worry not! Beneath all of these stylized absurdities, there's an actual story that knows how to intensify common battle tropes to entertaining levels, with a chain of events that never fails to leave me excited for the next one.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko Matoi is the protagonist we're following this time around. After circumstances led to her finding Senketsu, a sentient sailor suit who grants her great powers, she's now able to start an arduous journey and challenge Honnouji Academy, the place where she can find the answers to the murder of her father. A loner at first, but gradually accumulates into a girl who is reckless, badass, easily embarrassed, and earnest all at the same time, she personifies what it means to be a well-rounded female lead. The first half is particularly essential to establish the crazy world of Kill la Kill, although the seemingly constant clashing does make it a bit draggy at times. However, it's still important in providing a background to the parentless Ryuuko; most importantly, in how she grows up to being taken in by an eccentric family. She might look like someone who only has an attitude to fight anyone for her own benefit, but when you see her softening up to caring people, blandness is definitely not a part of her characterization.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, other characters are also here to steal the show. Not a single one of them are what you should consider to be normal people. Just imagine what it's like when a show has a large cast of unrestrained quirkiness\u2014with all boasting their own crazy fighting style and personality\u2014then let them duke it out wherever they go. Hopefully, what you imagined is a fast-paced battlefield full of exaggerated entertainment. From tough people like Satsuki and the Elite Four, to the weird exhibitionist teacher I mentioned before, and even buffoons like Mako, everyone weaves together into an overall thrill that's simply engaging to experience the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing worth mentioning are the overarching themes that are entwined within Kill la Kill itself. The family stuff I've discussed already is perhaps the most notable one, but things like fascism in Honnouji Academy, womanhood through the female characters, and the fashion of the clothing powers made of Life Fibers\u2014which serves as another pivotal mystery in conjunction with the murder of Ryuuko's father\u2014are some of the other topics that are present here. These underlying connections to real-world society may be glazed by over depending on how much knowledge you have, but if you pick them up, you'll realize there are a lot more interesting layers to this show than just mere exaggerations and fan services.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the art. Yep. The one that's responsible for giving the show its own distinctive style\u2014and it's marvelous to look at. The cel-shaded appearance exudes so many great personalities, with Trigger using a large number of visual techniques such as warm red tones, magnified expressions, bold typography, blinding rays of light, bizarre clothes designs, physics-defying animation, dramatic speed lines, and a mostly well-blended use of CGI to go all over the place; anywhere and anytime it wants. As simple as that. It embraces chaos and it's not afraid to be chaotic, which makes up for a lot of exciting action scenes. The only thing that slightly diminishes the show's fast-paced nature is with its tendency to repeat certain scenes, but they aren't detrimental enough to ruin the epic cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, an arrangement of booming soundtracks can be heard alongside the visual, another technical aspect that packs an energy to turn the over-the-top levels up to the highest elevation. Most notably for the character themes, every time the tracks start playing in the background, you'll know it's time for the scenes to get some majestic propulsion. And I also have to say. This show is loud. The characters are loud, the battles are loud, the comedies are loud. Roaring is what it will always blast and there's never a dull moment around when you have that for the entire run-time.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kill la Kill is a crazy show, but it's crazy good. It takes everything that is great in an action anime and energizes them up like an adrenaline rush, making for an entertainment that's a blast to watch through. Just don't lose your way watching this. Stay on the path for the entire ride, because you're about to get fully pumped-up.",

            "content": "--SOME MINOR SPOILERS--\r\nI don't think any anime in the last ten years has hit the scene with quite as big a punch as Kill la Kill. Being the figurehead launching point of TRIGGER, a studio complied mostly by Gainax alumni, there was without a doubt a lot of pressure on this series. Would these animators and writers be able to work that magic without the support of Gainax? Or would they crash and burn in their first attempt? No one knew what to expect. It was a new studio with no prior record of success or failure made up of creators originating from a studioknown for its somewhat controversial work. What was one TO expect?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully for TRIGGER, this one went well. \\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill in many ways gives the viewer a full spectrum of genres in a mere twenty four episodes. We get action, of course, in the VERY active and well choreographed fight scenes. We get drama, in the protagonist's own emotional journey regarding her relationship with others as well as herself. We get mystery, in the form of the question of Ryuko's father's death that she is trying to discover the truth about. We get comedy, in the form of just how clearly self-mocking many aspects of the premise and its execution are--this is a very self aware ecchi anime, have no doubt, and there's little doubt of a mocking finger being pointed at the viewer with the commentary on the Kamui design and the overall way its treated. There's even a little sci-fi once the show gets deeper into the plot, and one could argue even a little tragedy at some points. Simply put, Kill la Kill offers a LOT in a little package. \\n\\n\r\nSo why am I only giving it an 8/10 on story?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no matter how well complied it is, no matter how well the story is told, no matter how clever the comedy is executed, nothing can detract from the overall plot twist that is the Life Fibers. Don't get me wrong, it works exceptionally well in the story for how silly it is, but that doesn't change that it IS silly. And make no mistake, Kill la Kill knows this, and it is always somewhat tongue in cheek about it. But it simply is too silly to consider a real 9/10 or 10/10. It works, and its fun, and it rides out in a fantastic way but...yeah. It's silly at points. \\n\\n\r\nThis is accompanied by some pretty silly characters--but this time in a good way! These are some clear exaggerations of characters, but they exist outside of their archetypes as well. Ryuko is, to me, one of the most interesting female protagonists in anime and maybe in animation as a whole. She's a violent delinquent type, but she has good morals, but she doesn't really have self-control or a very precisely focused conscious, and she's very uncomfortable with her body, and she goes with her instinct. Why does this work, though? Because it does. It does work. \\n\\n\r\nAnd it works because Ryuko is a teenager. This is a very precise representation of the teenage internal conflict without having to harp on it. You are very aware of her consistent GROWTH through those teenage conflicts, but the show never has to precisely bring attention to it. You can just feel it in her behavior and her character as a whole. This makes watching her very fun because you get to watch her grow up. And she's not the only one, either. We get to see the realizations and changes in the solemn but powerful Satsuki Kiryuun, the four student council members (Gamagoori in particular has a neat subtle growth), and even the dumb but energetic Mako has her moments of growth. She's certainly funny enough. \\n\\n\r\nI personally love the art in this. Something about it is so simple yet has such a presence. Looking at the still art, this isn't actually too easy to see--the style doesn't seem like anything special, although it does look fairly good. But Kill la Kill is really at its best in motion. It has a neat balance between minimal animation and fast paced non-stop animation. The show is a good example of animation that takes advantage of a lower budget to experiment, using the points of minimal animation to typically run as a comedy point. That said, you can see some clear mistakes in the art (need we look any further than the infamous still shot of Ryuko and Satsuki fighting in their Kamui with toothpick waists), and its understandable how that could turn someone off to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound, on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nThe songs are fitting to the show. I didn't really like either at first, but they grew on me eventually. I LOVED the music sting at the end of the episodes in season 1. The music sting at the end in season 2 isn't as impacting, but it definitely still works very well. Ironically, I actually like the second opening more, but both have great flow to them once you accustom yourself to the sound that isn't quite what one is used to in anime. As for the rest of the soundtrack? Fantastic. Blumenkrantz? Echoing, disturbing, unnerving. Each theme of the student council? Undeniably suiting. Nui's theme? Jesus, just take me now. DON'T LOOOOSE YOUR WAAAAAAY? Its presence almost kinda reminded me of the use of a lyrical song in the battle scene in Persona 4, a fine comparison to be made. \\n\\n\r\nVoices are pretty your mileage may vary. And I don't mean that either the dub or original or bad, I mean that they're both pretty goddamn good but some characters are done better in each version. Satsuki's Japanese voice has an INTENSE presence that the dub simply didn't capture; on the flip side, the rough and coarse tone they went with for Ryuko in the dub felt far more individual and suiting to her character. Each character is pretty much up to you on which version is better, but ultimately, they're both great. It's one of the few times I would actually suggest watching both versions, because the delivery in each gives you something completely different in terms of quality. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole? I love this show. This is a great show. Its incredibly clever in its role as a parody, while still having a sturdy story and characters that exist outside of those jokes. You can feel a lot of love put into the production, design, characters, and story. Kill la Kill hit the scene with a punch for a reason and even now, long after it has finished, people still are talking about it and celebrating it. And I'm not surprised at all.",

Evangalion left me with a question about my Individuality and who am I ? just like that Kill la Kill left me with 2 questions like \"Why the hell a mother is touching her daughter in such a perverted way\" and \"Why the hell nipples are glowing\"    ;)\r\nSo kill la kill begin as a normal revenge story. Honnouji Academy where student wear uniform made of special fiber giving them inhuman ability to fight. Enters  Ryuuko Matoi a girl who is looking for killer ofher father and the only person know about the killer is the President of the Honnouji Academy Satsuki Kiryuuin. Ryuuko must fight everyone to go get the answers.\\n\\n\r\nkill la kill start off slow but keep on picking up pace and in the end become some thing good. Things get really interesting after the Plot twist. so i recommend watching till the plot twist before you drop this. \\n\\n\r\nThe only things I can see wrong in this anime is annoying comedians and bad animation.\\n\r\nOtherwise I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not the least this anime is ecchi so don't make mistake of watching with a family member like me or result can be very awkward.",

            "content": "Well wow.\r\nMy general rule in life is to expect little and to settle for little always, but only as the means of not being disappointed. \r\nI had had Kill la Kill in the back of my mind, in my to-watch list, for about 2 years now.\r\nI primarily get motivation to watch an anime according to how much it has inspired people to create art.\r\nI browse through the galleries of internet without the end, and I've got some 136.746 artworks collected thus far on my pc. Each picture hand picked, downloaded and sorted.\r\nKill la Kill had come to my notice as you can assume, by mehaving had come across some of it's art.\\n\r\nBefore, back then, I was still quite young of mind, allowing things like \"It's ecchi, not worth a chance\" to determine my choices.\\n\r\nI had been coming across many Kill la Kill artworks, and that was I assume at the time when it was aired, as that's when it's impression is going to be the strongest on the world, and thus the abundance of by it inspired artworks will have had it's highest spike ever(who knows, in the future maybe it'll be renowned for some reason and it'll spike again, but ofc. that's unlikely).\\n\r\nAnyways, I was repelled, as with most ecchi anime, thinking to myself \"I wish I'd stop seeing this stuff.. Why do people create such anime, why don't they take art seriously..\".\\n\r\nThat's the younger me. \\n\r\nI'm still young, but I'm older than I was before. :D\\n\r\nHaving had overcome the prejudice that ecchi=bad at first with B Gata H Kei, I had, well, overcome that barrier.\\n\r\nThat was still long ago.\\n\r\nNowdays ecchi in anime, is like the color of the sky, to the sky, or like the clouds are, when you look at the sky.  \\n\r\nSky is sometimes blue, sometimes.. Well, a different kind of blue. But it also sometimes has clouds, and sometimes it doesn't. :D\\n\r\nAnime can either have the trait of being ecchi, or not. You decide what traits define you.\\n\r\nAnywaaays, I had expected a lot from this anime, and I mostly usually expect as less as I realistically can, because when I expect anything more, I'm not satisfied.\\n\r\nThis anime delivered what is rarely ever delivered, it didn't fail my expectations.\\n\r\nNow, I'm gonna a tad bit go in to describing what made me like it, and it won't exactly be spoilers, but, to me everything is a spoiler so ok.\\n\r\nThis anime has friendship, has honor, has honorable friendship, has major plot progression, has a plot that basically starts exploding from a certain point, and in order to visualise the plots slapping in your face, one must use a logarithmic graph.\\n\\n\r\nI was having great fun 'till that certain point of the plot, it was enjoyable to the very bones of it.\\n\r\nComedy, ridiculousness, a plot, and the most important thing(for me), characters that are good.   \\n\r\nAll of the characters are somehow \"realistic\", none are stupid idiots that are just plain out stupid idiots (Why are you thinking about Mako? XD), as much as they might seem like they are, some of them, at some points. \\n\r\nHey, in this anime, okay now again, I point out, this is not directly a spoiler, but to me any insight is a spoiler so yea..\\n\r\nAnyways, the fkn. ecchi is actually explained in this story!\\n\r\nThe ecchi is actually a piece of the puzzle that the plot is.\\n\r\nAfter that one specific episode, my mouth just remained open for the remainder of the episode after that plot-goes-boom point of the episode.  \\n\r\nI was sticked to the screen.  \\n\r\nThis anime has seriousness, and plenty more of, well, slightly-less-than-seriousness.\\n\r\nThe ending of it is fulfilling and very warming in a way..  \\n\r\nIt's like, if you love seeing the characters you love, love each other.. This anime delivers.\\n\r\nThat's one of the prime reasons of why I've liked this as much as I have.  \\n\\n\r\nTo get technical, which is irrelevant for enjoyment(unless you chose for it to be of relevance):\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nJust my sort.\\n\r\nNo questions remaining in my mind.\\n\r\nNo holes in my heart(well, perhaps just a single one, but I'm only just now about to watch the extra(25th) episode, so I'm expecting that one to be filled as well :D Hopefully..).\\n\r\nLike, this story makes the ecchi part of the anime, for the most part, make sense.\\n\r\nLike, it's literally a piece of the plot, why the anime is ecchi.\\n\r\nUgh. and also, while for the 99% of the time, the ecchi doesn't escalate beyond what you've met with in the first episode, there is a few, rare occasions, later on, that are.. Yummy.\\n\r\nThe ecchi is what meets the eye at first sight for the 99% of the anime, and that's what makes that 1% extra sweet..\\n\r\nIt's not there just, well, to be there, it's there.. To be an extra-special presence. That's how I think of it, and it was very like.. I don't even know the word. The best word to use is \"yummy\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\r\nThe art is what made me go \"Wow this show is something else\" when I had just started watching it.\\n\r\nThe show does this thing that I adore, where it goes from straight out smoothe animation, to presenting the animation as if through rought sketches, but it's not sketches, it's all animation.  \\n\r\nIt looks very rought and artsy in one of the specific ways I like artworks to be.\\n\r\nIt's got that something that makes it look very detailed, and very prone to giving you the chills.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\n\"Don't loose your way..\"\\n\r\nI've felt like a kid.\\n\r\nAfter a few episode, you'll know what I mean, hopefully.\\n\r\nThe music will grow to becoming a catalyst of you receiving the chills.\\n\r\nAnd not just the fighting scenes..\\n\r\nThe extravagant presence of (a) certain character(s) is abundantly exclaimed with basically their own signature music.\\n\r\nIt's atmospheric to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThere are just a few characters who I didn't find a way to fully appreciate, but it doesn't matter much because there were more than one who were top tier for me. Most of the characters I've literally ended up adoring by the end, and by most I really do mean the most. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10/10\\n\r\nWell nyah, started this alone, got to ep 7, was left in mild awe.\\n\r\nRewatched the first 7 episodes with a friend 'cuz I've told him \"Mate, you gotta see this.\", and we've watched and watched.. Had to go home in the morning but I've finished it on my own and he'll finish it as well! :D\\n\r\nAnyways, this was superb fun to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I wonder..",

            "content": "Kill la Kill is an anime that is considered to be very polarised and judging the content I understand why.\r\nMany people say the female characters are strong and empowering and I personally say that is a load of crap.\r\nThe only female character I think that is good is Satsuki and that is it.\r\nAfter that the rest of the heroine are one dimensional. From having a moe type girl with a very bratty voice that is annoying who lacks a strong motive. The main heroine who is one of the most temperamental character I have ever seen that can make her seen more colder than batmanhimself.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Mako who could be just as bad or worse than Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan service is so gimmicky I understand if they wanted to show it once to show the main heroine won't get embarrassed from her outfit anymore and nudist beach is one of the stupidest idea I seen. To those who's hiding behind the fan service is well made. I have to disagree it's used as gimmick as we see it occur too much times more than enough to understand the message.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who want more powerful and amazingly written female characters go read battle angel alita (Gunnm) you won't regret. If you are after strong female characters I can promise, you won't be disappointed. This manga rarely or hasn't rely on fan service at all to demonstrate a woman's strength.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something over the top that focuses on comedy and parody(not satire) then Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise is the better alternative. When this series does fan service at least they are aware of it and the character makes a joke about it as it comments how modern anime relies on it too much.",

It gives an ecchi spin to the traditional power suit part of the genre of mecha anime.\r\nArt style wise, this anime is unique. It mixes mellow and dark colors for the setting and bright colors for the character designs and clothes. The animation is very fluid and the movement of each character is very human-like. \r\nThough the characters are a little flat, the main characters' personalities develop really well and they are very enjoyable to watch as each character's interactions differ depending on the personality they're assigned. Eachcharacter has their own little quirks that make them unique. Their unique back stories help you understand each characters' personality better.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of effort has been clearly put into this anime as the animation quality is amazing as well as the voice acting. They put a lot of effort into thinking about each character and their own situation which helps the viewer to remember that the characters are human, no matter their feats.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime that features characters that you can easily attach to as well as an enjoyable viewing experience involving the light-hearted comedy to the cute friendships between characters and the action-packed fight scenes, this anime is fun to watch and is a great example of good-quality entertainment.",

            "content": "*Non-Spoiler Review*\r\nIf there's an anime that I would recommend to someone who has never watched an anime before, and has the stigma that \"Anime is fanservice trash that flashes boobs and has no plot\", this is it. I have and will always tell them to start with Kill la Kill.  Being that I had not watch many anime prior to watching Kill la Kill, I had this stigma of it being fanservice garbage, too. Boy, was I wrong, and if you are thinking what I thought, I hope for this review to convince you to watch this.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe beginning might not be the bestto most people, but I personally enjoyed it. It's not plot heavy with the overarching story, but more a good time that gets you to know the characters and have a laugh. At this point, Kill la Kill is a comedy show. However, around the middle, a tone and plot shift happens. What makes this shift so good is the fact that it isn't choppy and goes smoothly into it, so even if you loved the beginning's lighthearted fun, you also will love the dark, serious tone later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nKill la Kill hosts some of the best animation ever seen come out of any anime studio, independent or major. The animation feels smooth, and there's tons of movement going on in every frame. Kill la Kill has it's fair share of Fate Stay/Night Unlimited Blade Works type of animation moments, with detailed backgrounds, but are limited in movement and look more like a painting, but the majority of the time is spent with the slightly less detailed but more animation packed into each moment and crevasse possible. Sometimes, limited animation is used for a comedic effect. I don't consider this a flaw, as it is intentionally used, and not because of budgetary issues, and it adds to scenes and makes them funnier.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nKill la Kill has one of the best soundtracks in any anime ever. Composed by Hiroyuki Sawano, who you may be familiar with for composing popular anime with renowned soundtrack Attack on Titan, did an amazing job on this. Every piece of music fits perfectly with the character or moment played, and all are great pieces I listen to even after watching Kill la Kill for a long time. The music from Kill la Kill can be heard over and over again without getting boring. Some standout songs include Before my Body is Dry, or the one that says \"Don't Lose Your Way\", and Blumenkranz.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nKill la Kill has a character with a wide variety of personalities, all of which are enjoyable as hell. The main character, Ryuuko Matoi, is one of the most 3 dimensional and enjoyable protagonists in an anime. The way she was written is creative, and her gradual development isn't wasted and comes to a great conclusion at the end. Mako Mankanshoku, the secondary protagonist, is one of the most enjoyable and lighthearted characters to ever grace the anime industry. Even in some of the dark moments of Kill la Kill, Mako is always there to make you happy and smile. Satsuki Kiryuuin, the main antagonist, is a great one. Notable side characters include the rest of the Mankanshoku family, Aikuro Mikisugi, the two main protagonists' teacher, and Takarada, the money making god.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment is the most crucial part to how good a series is. If it isn't enjoyable, then what's there to like about it? Watching something not enjoyable is almost as fun as doing homework. Thankfully, Kill la Kill is very enjoyable. Whether it's lighthearted and joking or dark and serious, you can't stop fanning yourself when you watch Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kill la Kill is a 9/10, and is one of my personal favorites. Also, if you're a dub watcher, Kill la Kill host one of the best dubs you'll ever watch in anime, so there's a plus for you guys.",

            "content": "Good anime series, one of the more enjoyable ones I've seen on my watching-old-anime streak recently. The comedy was great to the point where I laughed out loud a few times, Mankanshoku absolutely destroying it with the cuteness and jokes. Overall I really enjoyed the characters' personalities.\r\nThat being said I felt like the anime was trying too hard to surprise us at some points especially at the end where things sometimes not even shown come up later as plot points in the fight or whatever. I am also starting to see some common tropes in Studio Trigger's plot which has made some scenes very predictable.Some more work could be done establishing some things nearing the end of the series because I felt like the first half of the story didn't really push that fast in terms of story compared to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't really mind the fan-service much but I'm not really watching it for that, heck the only reason I watched this anime in the first place was because I saw Ryuuko's design and thought it looked cool. Also very heavy on the symbolism as with all of Studio Trigger's works. Overall I just think that its a good anime to pick up if you're bored of conventional action anime and just want a mix of comedy and action.\\n\\n",

The tunes are catchy and will have you humming away. KLK music is used all over YouTube by anime fans with good reason. Secondly, the characters are so unique! It's the little things that bring each character to life. The bubbly of Mako, the 1/2 punchline of Tsemugo, the strong female lead of Ryuuko, the opening collar of Houka, the resolve of Ira, and even the silly dog! The list goes onand on! You won't find a single cliche character here. The art in this anime is not a premium quality, but that's because it has its own flavor and style. What it lacks in detail it makes up for in rock solid combat and environmental staging. The combat scenes are insane!!!! So many 360 flips with a fast pace that doesn't stop for 5 minutes in the middle of combat for dragged out reflection of a bunch of bullshit you already know. These warriors waste no time getting to the point. Additionally, this anime is hilarious! They've mastered the art of mixing humor into the action for maintaining a healthy balance. The story is so funny! You cannot say clothes trying to take over the world is not a fresh approach. And they manage to roll this onto you in a serious and humorous way at the same time. All in all, KLK is an armored titan among anime leaving no gaps. You cannot regret watching this. Even critics that despise this anime give it 6/10 as a testament to resist their true feelings of a higher rating.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Amazing characters.\\n\r\n-Unbelievable soundtrack.\\n\r\n-Perfect blend of humor and action.\\n\r\n-Fast paced battles wasting no time.\\n\r\n-Refreshing and inspiring art style.\\n\r\n-Mountains of laughter.\\n\r\n-Mild fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Aniplex charges an arm and a leg for this series.",

Pretty damn far, shows Kill la Kill.\r\nBeautiful in animation style and incredibly funny, Kill la Kill is a series about grandiose fights in talking, intelligent and very, very revealing clothes. It is chock full of unashamed fanservice of both sexes and entirely lacking in all seriousness.\r\nThe pace is mostly excellent, but honestly the last four or so episodes do feel to drag on a bit too long. In my opinion the storyline could well have wrapped up sooner to make room for a full \"a month later...\" episode. As it stands, theconclusion feels hasty and a tiny bit lacking in emotional closure, but that's a minor nitpick in a series that doesn't demand very much from the viewer in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nGreat fun and sexy fights, what more do you need to say?",

            "content": "[Spoiler free review with TL:DR at the bottom]\r\n[Note: Keep in mind, that like any other review, most of this is opinion based. There is no need to hurt over it, just my honest thoughts, and it's not all negative]\r\nLate to the party but better late than never.\r\nI'm one of those people that hold the notion, that just because something is different, that doesn't necessarily translate to better. For something to be unique it has to be different with a positive quality. And what makes and breaks something, is always the execution of 'different'. This is unfortunately not the case with Kill la Kill.\r\nRight off thebat in the first episode, you will be overwhelmed with Kill la Kill's style. If there is one thing that all can agree on, is that the series has it's own style for better or worse. If you watched the famous Gurren Lagan, you will get accustomed quickly to the larger than life approach of Kill la Kill, as some of the staff that worked in TTGL, worked in Kill la Kill. Most notably Imaishi Hiroyuki, the director.\\n\\n\r\nIn the following episode I started to like it, as the first episode shocked my expectations more than anything and I wasn't able to digest it well. The story is simple and straight forward. It''s about Matoi Ryuuko, searching for answers for her father's killer, which lead her to Honnouji Academy, the rest you can read in the synopsis so no point in repeating here. The main issue with this storyline is that it's stretched thin for the next 12 or so episodes, with little hints dropped here and there where the show brings it up again. That means for the most part, Ryuuko just spends her time trying to take down, Satsuki. And in order for her to get to Satsuki, she has to go through some henchmen and henchwoman, fodder basically. And I'm really not a fan of monster of the week format.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, she faces the elite four. Where in each fight, Ryuuko asspull some power and conjure an ability of Senketsu when she is beaten badly and about to lose. Which might not be a big deal, since the show doesn't take itself all too seriously at this point. But it does make the fights boring and predictable. Since Ryuuko's fight with Satsuki's at episode 3, there really hasn't been any interesting or great fights for those 12 or so episodes. Be it in excitement, intensity, choreography, or animation. If the show somehow was able to keep that quality constant, I would have sung praises for it action wise, which is a big portion of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story main problems are it's simplicity, predictability and it's constant switch from something that want to be taken seriously or something that is just nonsensical that you should take with a grain of salt and lack of skepticism. And I suppose that reflects on the show as whole as KLK can't decide by the second half if it wants to be taken seriously, it's a tad confusing. Almost like an identity crisis brought fourth by it's B-movie level plot twists and red herrings and sometimes campy plot points. The predictability here without spoiling is when you know something is going to happen and it's very obvious, but the show reveals the moments like it's something shocking that you wouldn't see coming. It just leads to a very predictable conclusion. Another example, is in the plot twists. The best thing about plot twists, at least for me, is the unpredictability of it. The sense of knowing something is going to happen due to nicely placed subtle foreshadowing, yet not completely being able to predict what's gonna happen and how it happened so it can satisfy you when it occur in a mind blowing tasteful manner that generates excitement and sometimes make you search in your mind for previous/old possible hints. That wasn't the case for the plot twists here. There is no sense of careful planing and foreshadowing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Might seem peculiar to start this with Mako, who is a comic relief character for the most part and Ryuuko's best friend. But believe it or not, she takes up a huge amount of screen time despite her almost nonexistent role on the plot and the bigger picture, her real relevance is Ryuuko. As she influences her and is essential to the small amount of development Ryuuko got. For those who adore Mako, don't get me wrong I liked her and all in the beginning. She was an odd ball, even considering the show she is in, and was enjoyable to watch. But she keeps interrupting fights and conflicts like no tomorrow. It kills the mood being setup and It's just frustrating sometimes, instead of giving focus to the important characters in said conflict, we get to see Mako waste a couple of minutes every damn time. This is generally an issue that isn't exclusive to Mako but the general tone of the show, and how it switches between serious and comedic within a finger snap that I will get to later.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuko. To be frank, I wanted to like her but I couldn't, she hindered a lot of my enjoyment with the series. Especially in the latter half. She basically has the persona of a meathead shounen protagonist. Her lines and dialogue are trite. It's hard to root for her, when you can't connect with her, she feels bratty more than anything. She doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes. I believe she went through the same stage of development twice. No charm, no distinctive personality. There is just nothing in particular that I liked about her or something that stood out. And she comes off even worse when compared to the antagonist of the first half, and the deuteragonist of the show Satsuki.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one saving grace in terms of writing for this series, in my opinion, it has to be Satsuki. She is just head and shoulders above any character in the series. Strong resolve, mentally strong, awesome and engaging dialogue and better development. By the end of it, you might not recognize her. She had a good buildup and foreshadowing for future revelation (only actual good foreshadowing in the show was on her) and she is not just a perfect ojou sama. She is shown to be weak and vulnerable a few times. Her personality feels believable. She had a lot of great speeches, a compelling ideology, a charismatic leader with strong will and a powerful presence in the show and a good basis of conflicts with the main antagonist and the protagonist. She had a good back story, and a good explanation for her motives. She was properly fleshed out. Only if the other characters followed suit. As the rest are just character stereotypes, one track characters, that get boring and dry quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor. It's a big part of the show, and it needs to be talked about. It started as something creative, something actually funny. But it just continued to become more of the same till the end. Repetitive. For example, the use of nudity in general and the comedic scene of Aikurou's striping was funny, creative and unique the first time they did it. But they kept doing it over and over and yes you guessed it right over again. The problem here is that it's not needed since what he says during it, is usually not important and just common sense, it takes a portion of the episode away. Mako hallelujah thing while not as repetitive and unfunny, it's also isn't used well sometimes because it's kills the tension and gets in between important scenes. Like I explained earlier, the show just doesn't know how to jiggle between seriousness and comedy, it doesn't know how to transition well into comedy, without ruining and undermining a serious scene. It was the bad use of comedy, that made me start to dislike the show near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art. This is a bit of tricky aspect. While the actual quality of animation and budget is below average. The studio uses that to it's advantage, by making comedy out of slideshow animation, and 2 frames movement. I don't know whether to praise it, or not. But I think while I can give props, to smart usage of budget, it's still doesn't always work right in the end. The art, here is where the series shine, it's very good, stylish, and works well with the atmosphere and the personality the show wants to take for itself. Beautiful colors, some cool designs, and overall very solid. The music. The OST, was amazing, it had some tracks, that stood out, and made you pumped. But unfortunately, the placement of it, wasn't so amazing. Some were really overused, instead of expanding on the whole track.\\n\\n\r\nI think what really got to me, and made go suddenly from liking the show, to disliking it was the pacing, and it having too many episodes for it's own good. It just dawned to me, while I was watching one of the episodes in the second half, that the show lost it's charm and how everything is just dull, lifeless and repetitive beyond belief. It just killed my enjoyment. Most of the characters being one/two dimensional and having bad dialogue that I feel like I've been hearing it for an eternity. Everything felt so boring. It felt like I have already seen the same conversation between the characters a thousand times over, the same dull humor. The repetitiveness and the predictability. The anime lost it's fun factor for me, because nothing and new and creative in it.\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been avoided with better pacing. 13 episodes might have made this a very solid show, alas we got plenty of episodes that contributed nothing to the very simple plot that was already stretched thin to begin with or to the characterizations of the characters. Episodes that contributed very little and episodes that felt like a straight up filler. Where the humor and the charm of the show were all used up and dried. Of course, that might not be the studio's fault, since who knows what led to this decision but having 2 cour, instead of one just hurt the show tremendously. Because if a show drives on 'fun', it can't be too long without offering a new experience or it will become boring fast, which is what I feel the case was with Kill la Kill. And this is one of the reasons why TTGL just triumphs it, the actual content of TTGL were well fit for 27, while KLK weren't for 24 episodes. And TTGL, provided a new experience with the next half, and actually made the viewers take it seriously, despite how crazy and over the top it still was, while KLK failed at that, and couldn't decide whether it wanted to be taken seriously or not, with such a weak plot and conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end I think KLK was an ambitious, and hyped project, that didn't live up to it's spiritual predecessor. That could have been a lot better if it was one cour. A lot of decent ideas, but ultimately poor execution. Overall I think it's mediocre, but since I really like Satuski, that warrants an extra point, because she is a genuinely good character, not just comparatively but on her own.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR. KLK is a very style over substance type of series, do not expect much from the plot, but expect a lot of action. It's recommend if you are looking for the same taste of shows like TTGL, but in keep in mind unlike TTGL, Kill la Kill, has more issues in pacing, implementing humor and story. KLK really never reaches the scale of an epic, that TTGL did. KLK also incorporates ecchi in a way that it's relevant to the plot and characters, so if you are one of those who are allergic to seeing naked bodies of both gender, constantly, this is might not be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "Story-7\r\nThe story is pretty simple. The plot is something that you can see in many action anime. But, the plot twists is what makes the story pretty good. The pacing seems slow at the 1st half, but the 2nd seems rushed a little bit and I wish the ending could be more complex. Also, the settings are different from what you've probably seen in most action anime.\r\nArt-8\r\nSome people might not agree with the score. But, overall, I find the art to be a pretty decent. There are some moments that have a mediocre art, but in some battles ( especially 2nd half ), I findthat this is where animators put a lot of hard work in it.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\\n\r\nSeems Trigger had put a lot of effort in delivering the action lovers  the over-the-top, epic feeling that's suitable for this kind of genre. The OPs and EDs are pretty well-fitted and catchy. The voice actors had done a good job in making their characters lively. \"Before my blood is dry\" and \"Blumenkranz\" are one of the tracks that I find to be the most befitting music for the epic, over-the-top atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters have a good character development. The minor characters grow a pretty good development as well but, there are also some forgettable characters too. Many of the characters that I like because there are some characters that are relatable, and others' antics are just entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nAs an action lover, I find this anime to be a fun, thrilling roller-coaster ride. The \" over-the-top, monster-of-the-week \" concept are well- executed in this anime and the genres are well done by Trigger. The fantastic blend of the story, art, sound, character and settings is a good reason why this anime is enjoyable to me. Action lovers and people who simply enjoy an entertaining anime will enjoy this anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is quite well-rounded . That's the overall of this anime in my point of view. Good job and thanks to the Trigger for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nP/S : Hope you can give a feedback on my reviews. That way, I can improve on my future reviews.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*SPOILERS WARNING*\r\nKill La Kill is one the more popular shows to come out recently. Hell, i can't go a day on the internet or just being out with my friends without hearing of it. The majority of my friends love it, and only a very, very small minority don't, and which side am I on? I'm with the very, very small minority of my friends who don't. I don't out right despise the show like Sword Art Online if you read my rather...abrasive, review on it. There are redeemable traits in this show, they just weren't around enough for me to really enjoy it. \r\nStory\r\nThesynopsis is already there for you, and due to MAL's guidelines, i'm not supposed to write this synopsis here since it is already written on it's page on this site. The story is rather cut and dry of any shounen series you would watch. The two main characters of this story are actual siblings, which was, fairly obvious from how similar their backstories if you really paid attention since about, episode 3 (quote from one of my friends). And going back, he was fairly spot on about that. They also have that other cliche of the evil parent, the rebellious, edgy protagonist who happens to be the younger sibling and the orderly, commanding elder sibling who is a rival for that rebellious protagonist. The way the writing is executed makes the show seem like it wants you to take it seriously, but at the same time, not. It's confused on what it wants to be. This is shown whenever they're talking about things that are there to advance the plot, but then Mikisugi's glowing crotch or nipples are just there to take away any sort of involvement you may have for this show or it's plot. And I know they want you, as the viewer, to take it seriously because of a very important plot detail that has to do with Ryuko's immortality and backstory. The show also really has no point of normalcy. Let me give an example. Fooly Cooly and Gurren Lagann were both made by the people who made Kill La Kill who had left Gainax to go to Trigger. In both of these shows, they established the world with a sense of normality. Simon becomes hesitant when they try to take over the landship on Episode 8 of Gurren Lagann. Kamina comes in to punch him because he told him if he caught Simon doubting himself, he would be there to literally pummel any doubt out of him. He does this twice in the episode. Once before he is stabbed, and once right before he dies. It knocks doubt from Simon and he gets back up on his feet to fight for his friends and his brother. After this, the action scene known as \"Kamina's Last Stand\" portrays the first viewing of the most over-the-top moment of the show at this point, the Giga Drill Break. And as I said, after this, Kamina dies from his wounds. Simon and Team Dai-Gurren mourn at the loss of their leader who had brought them this far. Fooly Cooly does this in a more everyday life manner, while also making it completely over-the-top and ridiculous. Naota is stuck in the mindset that nothing amazing will happens in his hometown, and that nothing amazing will ever happen to him or it. Haruko, who knows this is the way he thinks, tells him \"Nothing can happen, until you swing the bat.\" It was a metaphor about the episode that started out with Naota playing baseball, and he never tried to hit the ball once. Near the end of the episode, Haruko was asked to hit back a bomb that was going to blow up the city. Haruko, after giving Naota batting practice, gave him the chance to swing the bat and save the city. All of the people monitoring the bomb sees that, and Amarao says that he'll never do it, symbolizing that he'll never take his own steps into making life extraordinary. But when it came down to it, Naota did swing the bat at the overgrown bomb that looked like a baseball, making his first steps towards something amazing. There were normal events happening behind these moments that made them feel so much better to see. While Kill La Kill just does them all the time with no build up to them, so they just come off as annoying, repetitive, and boring. These constant over-the-top moments become the point of normalcy, so my overall reaction was just \"meh\" the whole time. It's like they kind of forgot what made their over-the-top moments so great which is why this show was so bland at times to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are some honest to good characters in this show, but my main problem with this is that it feels like we're following the wrong character in this show from beginning to end. I'll state why with going over some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRyuko Matoi\\n\r\nOur rebellious, edgy protagonist. This character is over-privileged, over-powered, not really interesting, and really just down right mean spirited. She's immortal, that fact alone made me know the immediate outcome of this show when I saw the last episode. She was a life-fiber lab rat who was thrown out because they believed she died in the middle of these tests, but she did live and her father did save her and raise her for a good amount of her life. When he was killed, she sought out the killer and, even though she said she wasn't out for revenge, the minute she meets Nui Harime, she loses her cool and attacks her maliciously, causing her to go into a blood rage like berserk mode. This plot point really only boiled down to the cliche revenge arc that has not been interesting since the 1990's. Granted, after this she does become afraid of Senketsu after that whole ordeal, refusing to wear him because she's afraid she might go berserk again. This plot point could have been an extra point for this show if she didn't start wearing him again because some Randy mixed her and Mako's family into his own problems. She has no real obligation to wear Senketsu other than some Randy said \"put the sailor suit on, Ryuko\". When she does put him back on, turns out the Randy was actually Nui, and when they fight, she destroys Senketsu. THIS ALSO could have been a good plot point for how Ryuko had taken Senketsu for granted, and feeling like an over-privileged brat. But nope, this plot point was also thrown out the window when Nui cut up every single thread except his eye piece that keeps him alive. She never really apologized to Senketsu after this either, she just put on some gym clothes, hopped on a bike, and went to go get the remaining parts of Senketsu back that were being used to power the star uniforms at Honnouji academy. Later on, when Ragyou puts her plan into motion to cover the world in clothing, it is revealed that Ryuko is basically immortal from all of those tests as a child, because her heart is covered in life fibers. For some reason, with no explanation, a one month time skip happens after this event, and she was in a coma after finding this out. She does finally wake up after people making so much noise it basically woke her from her coma. After completely tearing the place she was at to shreds, Senketsu, who has been unquestioningly loyal to her, and has never talked down to her once, asks if she's alright. For no reason, she turns on him and calls him, and herself a monster because her heart is made of life fibers. I wouldn't have a problem with this if it wasn't completely irrational. She's been aging at the regular rate of a normal human girl. Nothing about her stands out to be anything out of the ordinary, it's just some pseudo drama i feel the show put in. Also it just makes her look like a down right mean-spirited bitch who doesn't deserve the people in her life that have been good to her. Senketsu has never really wronged in anyway up to this point, and I would sympathize with him more than Ryuko in this situation because he is honestly a likable character unlike his host, who is just mean-spirited for no reason. Speaking of pseudo drama, Ryuko gets corrupted by Ragyou and Nui into their way of thinking...just cause...because the plot wouldn't go anywhere if they didn't, and without showing it, they apparently sewed Junketsu onto her, while it looked like she just put it on of her own free will. And if Satsuki and the others try to take it off her, she'll bleed out and die. The thing is, we already established that she's immortal, so any sort of pain will immediately heal, no matter how severe the injury. It was obvious how this would play out, so it took away any sort of tension or emotional attachment to this part of this show that I barely had any of, since she is immortal and will win against her mom, obviously. The final battle ensues and I was severely annoyed with how it had to be Ryuko who fought Ragyou, instead of Satsuki. I'll get into that later with Satsuki's character. The only reason why it was Ryuko who fought her is that she's the protagonist. That's really the only reason. Satsuki has more right than her, but since Satsuki isn't the main protagonist, she gets out-shined by her bland little sister. In this fight, she makes the uncharacteristic decision to try and start over with her mother, but her mother refuses and kills herself. She then falls back to Earth, and since this fight used up all of Senketsu's power, it killed him in the process. Ryuko now only starts to feel regret to all of the things she's done to him now that he's dying. Again, I would feel inclined to like you if you had done this sooner, Ryuko. But you didn't, because you are more or less more enthralled with the feeling of power. When you first got him back, you just said \"i'm glad you're alright.\" You never said you were sorry at all. So this translated to \"I'm glad my source of power is alright.\" After falling back to Earth, everyone catches her, some time passes, and the show ends. Happily ever after. Yay...sorta. On a final note for her,  Ryuko is in no way a good character. She is not sympathetic, there's no way to relate to her, over-privileged, over-powered, bland, and honestly just a terrible person. (On a side note, this is subjective, but that whole entire end segment of the fight reminded me of S-CRY-ed's final episode, and after realizing that, I went immediately to that fight to just go watch how epic it is again compared to Kill La Kill's).\\n\\n\r\nMako Mankanshoku\\n\r\nAfter watching this show, this character legitimately became my most hated character of anything. Now topping Ken Amada from Persona 3. And Ken was a hard one to beat. Any time this character was on screen, I felt as though my intelligence was being insulted. The episode would stop dead in it's tracks when this character came on screen to have her literal spotlight to reiterate things we already knew. She's really annoying and high pitched. She has no character other than being the comic relief friend for the protagonist. Her family is not as bad since they don't get as much exposure. And when she had her own episode, I was literally tempted to skip it. There is nothing likable or charming about this girl at all, she's annoying and she derails the plot whenever she's on screen. And it turns out, I honestly could have skipped her episode, because she doesn't change at all after that, her relationship with Ryuko doesn't exactly deepen anymore after that, it was entirely pointless and is nothing more than a filler episode with the inevitable JoJo's reference.\\n\\n\r\nSenketsu\\n\r\nI feel so sorry for you my friend...you were the most likable character on Ryuko's side of this story, and you had to deal with so much shit when you were on this girl's side the whole time. You were shunned, put down, and you were never even given a real apology for all of the shit Ryuko did. So I will be the person to do it. I am so, very sorry.\\n\\n\r\nAikurou Mikisugi\\n\r\nThis guy is like male Mako, but he's tolerable...to an extent. The things he says does advance the plot, and not reiterate it like Mako does. And when I said this show doesn't know what it wants to be earlier, this guy was pretty much one of the main reasons. His actions were detracting my attention from what he was saying, and I actually had to go back a few times because the show decided it wanted to be goofy by showing off the fact that yes, he is a part of Nudist Beach. But he doesn't need to pose every two seconds. Just have him talk for Christ sake. And unlike Mako, he does aid Ryuko in battle multiple times, as well as give her bits of information throughout the show. He also gave her the glove that allows her to power Senketsu at will, instead of having to pull an Eren Jaegar and possibly biting her hands. Also he fought without having to use life fibers, which i adored because EVERYONE is so dependent on them in this show.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugu Kinagase\\n\r\nI like you. You know how things work when push comes to shove. You're willing to make sacrifices if they are needed. You're a silent badass character i'm ok with. You also never fought with life fibers, only your nail guns. I just wish you had more screen time to develop your character.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki Kiryuin\\n\r\n10/10 100/100 Best Character, Best Character, Best Character. *Cough* Sorry. Moving on. Satsuki Kiryuin is, without argument, the most developed and interesting character in this show. Sure, she's still the orderly, commanding elder sister cliche, but at least she's doing things that are interesting. The main reason she created Honnouji Academy was to build an army strong enough to fight her mother so that she won't have to live a life enslaved to clothes. She does not like anything her mother stands for. She will use anyone to get to her goal, then throw them out when she doesn't need them anymore. When Satsuki made the Academy, without realizing it, this is exactly what she was doing herself. She didn't care who it was, as long as she found someone useful, she would use them to further her own agenda and toss them aside. But it turns out that, without these people she used, she never would have gotten this far. She changes and now relies on others, instead of using them. If she kept going down that road, she would have been no better than the very woman she was trying to stop. This was shown when she tried going up against the corrupted Ryuko on her own, her mother on her own, and when Gamagoori and the others stood in front of Ryuko when she had asked Satsuki if she could punch her. There is some honest, good writing in this show, and it saddens me that it was used on a character who is infinitely more sympathetic and likable than Ryuko is.\\n\\n\r\nIra Gamagoori\\n\r\nI'll be honest, he's your token big bodyguard like henchman who will do anything for his leader. But he is admirable. If he sees others in danger, even if it's Ryuko, he will go to their aid because his backstory reveals that he is the kind of person who likes to aid people who need help. He teels Ryuko that even though she is his enemy, she is still a student at Honnouji Academy, and that he is bound by his position on the student council to aid any student in trouble when they need it. He's a man of his word, and he's a pretty cool dude when he isn't growing to massive sizes to yell at people.\\n\\n\r\nUzu Sangeyama\\n\r\nHe is your token rival who does eventually join up with their rival so he can become strong enough to beat them one day, but I like how he acknowledges his faults. He knows that he got cocky when fighting Ryuko, and he desperately wanted to prove himself to Satsuki that he isn't dead weight and that he is useful. He goes as far to have his eyes sewn shut so that his eyes won't ever betray his judgement ever again. And this time around, he does beat Ryuko, quite easily even, because he is determined to prove himself. I like a guy with conviction.\\n\\n\r\nNonon Jakuzure\\n\r\nWhat...is wrong...with your voice? It sounds really forced, and it was quite hard to listen to ( I am referring to the japanese dub, if you haven't noticed yet). But she is also your token best friend henchman. Nothing really stands out about her. I don't hate her character, I don't particularly like her either, she's just kind of there to me. But for the love of god, don't make her talk. Please.\\n\\n\r\nHouka Inumuta\\n\r\nYour token Tech Henchman who's super smart. Same thing with Nonon, but his voice isn't annoying.\\n\\n\r\nRagyou Kiryuin\\n\r\nOk, let's be honest here. You have as much depth as a villain as a first generation Power Rangers villain. You're just evil for the sake of being evil. Clothes chose us, so I guess I don't have a say in the matter. She's not an interesting villain because she has no real motivation other than \"CLOTHES ARE OUR SAVIORS\". She's not realistic because she is so unbelievably cruel as a person to her own daughter, even after she betrayed her. She doesn't feel a bit of remorse nearly striking Satsuki down, same with Ryuko. She's nowhere close to being like an actual human, so I don't really feel enthralled with this character as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nNui Harime\\n\r\nI should have addressed this earlier, but I absolutely hated how Ryuko always had to rely on Senketsu to fight. It has been proven that Ryuko can fight just fine without Senketsu, and she doesn't really need him since she's immortal, but when Nui first came on screen, I was happy because she I thought she was using her own strength to fight, and it was a breath of fresh air because I thought she would be that chaotic neutral character in the series, like Gilgamesh in Fate/Zero. But, my hopes were shot down hard when she's really just a pawn for Satsuki's mom and is completely made of life fibers. Soon after Ryuko breaks from Junketsu, Ryuko goes after Nui, and for some reason the show wanted to make the action of her getting her arms sliced off...funny. It wasn't in anyway funny, it was just disturbing. I'm not going to be like \"haha, her arms got cut off.\" i'm going to be like \"Oh my fucking god, she cut her arms off.\" With the way Kill La Kill was going, it was trying to be serious, still failing, miserably, but trying. This was one of those moments to try, and they messed it up. Good job.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is very inconsistent. Some of the drawings will look fine in an episode, but next it'll be terribly drawn, and it would seem with the low budget already put into this show from it's animation, gets worse whenever high paced things start happening. Faces will get weirdly distorted in ways faces shouldn't be, and it just comes off as, unsettling.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nYou know, I would have been alright with you if you didn't reuse the same song every time Ryuko busted in to try and collect Senketsu's parts in that one episode. That got annoying, really fast. And i honestly muted the episode and just read the subs a few times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEhh...I paid attention anytime Satsuki was on the screen, but anytime something around Ryuko went on I couldn't care less..\\n\\n\r\nSCORE\\n\r\n3/10 \\n\r\nAs stated earlier, I feel as though there is a good story in this show, it was just wasted on the wrong character. What should have been Satsuki's story mostly, was Ryuko's. And Ryuko isn't a good character. Feel free to disagree with me if you so wish. I'm not trying to say you should hate this show, or anything. I'm just some guy on the internet, and so are you.",

They have real personalities, feel real pain and make real mistakes, nothing like some one dimensional token \"big boobs\" girls. Kill la Kill has nothing like that. All I can say is don't judge it before youwatch at least a few episodes because it will blow you away. I can honestly say it is one of my favorite out of all the anime I have seen, which is a lot, so that definitely means is worth while, and whether you will be blown away or not like I was, you will absolutely have fun with Kill la Kill!",

I can't help but pick at the plot and story of the later half of Kill la Kill which had essentially rinsed out elements of Gurren Lagaan and implemented into the story.\r\nIt got to point where for the last 10 episodes I tried to pick our parts of the episode thathad elements of Gurren Lagaan in it. Example... the Naked Sun looks like the Dai Gurren (minus protruding mecha) it shot through the Original Life Fibre and into the academy (Dai Gurren shot itself into Lord Genome Castle)\\n\\n\r\nOne episode Ryuko silhouette resembled Gurren Lagaan, Ryoku was the same as the main antagonist in the same way that Simon and Genome shared the same power and mecha type and the list can actually go on... Sanegeyama character is the viral of this series... with the whole upgrading theme still going.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending did leave me a bit unsatified because the whole build up is the same as the first half of Gurren which leaves you with the impression that it could potentially start up against with another half actually focusing on Life Fibre invading earth and forcefully taking over. Though at the same time, Kill la Kill ending did have some positives which left me a bit satified but in the end it still 50/50...\\n\\n\r\nOverall a good series and despite the fan services, you will just get use to it and will just watch it without getting bothered...

The one anime I recommended watching at least a few episodes of before picking this one up is Dragon Ball, since there are at last two direct references to the show in this anime. Another thing to remember is that you are not supposed to take everything seriously. This show is full of wonderful incomprehensible goofball moments that show embraces, while also showing a more serious side.\r\nIt is also in some of the more over the top episodes, that you can find some gratecommentary on family. For one thing episode 7, at its core is all about family and is over all one of the best early episodes that the anime has to offer. It also helps to set up just how closes Ryuko and Mako have become as friends\\n\\n\r\nAnother think will Kill La Kill, is that the first few episodes are a little too slowly paced, in fact the pace didn\u2019t seem to pick up very much until episode 11 and over all things didn\u2019t kike into high gear until about episode 17. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime also reveals the true purpose of Honnouji Academy\\n\r\nalong with what Satsuki has been planing from the time she was five years old.

You may enjoy it, but no matter what you'll probably question what the f**k is going on, and those are some of the most fun bits, enjoy. So apparently the review needs to be longer so I'll stretch it out a bit by saying that Ecchi can sometimes suffer a fate worse than early cancellation, it's when it forfeits the story for \"plot\", youall know what I mean, anyway I don't think it does that personally which is good, others may disagree, but hey at the end of the day I'm a random on a keyboard don't let me tell you that you should enjoy it, just give it a go.",

            "content": "Trigger\u2019s dynamic duo of director Hiroyuki Imaishi and writer Kazuki Nakashima, both previously of the well-received Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, come together once again to present an exciting, fast-paced story about\u2026 clothing! Kill la Kill challenges the conventions of certain genres and delivers itself as a creative exposition tailored to fit any enthusiast with a spirit for the nonsensical.\r\nStory (read the synopsis first!)\r\nKill la Kill honestly blindsided me with how such an absurd concept ended up working out so well. Quest for your father's killer? Life-empowering clothing?  Extremely dangerous school environment? Sentient uniforms that get sexier as they get stronger? Why the hell notmix all of that together? The depth experienced from the end result was a welcome surprise and greatly enriched my appreciation for the series.\\n\\n\r\nStructurally, the show follows three \"arcs\", with the first of the show involving Ry\u016bko overcoming trials set before her by Satsuki, the second arc a gauntlet type event resolved with a shocking revelation that flips the show on its head. As I cannot get into that portion (or the third arc) without revealing critical spoilers, know that the show actually gets dramatically better as it progresses. Initially, the tonal shift and expository evolution was a bit disorienting, though considering the end result, it was a worthwhile decision.\\n\\n\r\nGenre and Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nA majority of the show\u2019s comedy is satirical in nature as it plays upon the various characteristics and tropes commonly found in other genres, notably shounen, mecha, and other school animes. Dialogue, exposition, power are often over-exaggerated to emphasize the ridiculous nature of those aspects used to a clich\u00e9d extent. The oppressive red letting that accompanies introductions and explanations, too, are an element of the show\u2019s over-the-top depiction.\\n\\n\r\nAction finds itself at the heart of Kill la Kill, as clothing exists for more than just aesthetic purposes. Combat evolves as the characters do, with more advanced outfits presenting their respective wearer with additional benefits, attacks, or powers. The kamui, specifically, change and diversify as either Ry\u016bko or Satsuki become more attuned to their respective editions. For the most part, the fighting was fairly entertaining and well-choreographed, only improving as the series (and characters themselves) progressed.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, in a series focused about clothing, there\u2019s a fair bit of bare skin shown (for both the males and females). Whether you\u2019re a fan of partial nudity or not, the creative way that Kill la Kill makes use of it can and should be appreciated. The partial nudity is utilized more as a part of the plot or an element of the previously mentioned satirical undertones. Mako, for instance, often refers to Ry\u016bko as an \u201cexhibitionist\u201d while she is empowered with Senketsu, mentioning the irony of the stronger she became, the more skin she showed. All in all, it\u2019s never felt like a detriment to the series, and fans of such content will definitely be pleased with what they get.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is a particularly stylized anime. Exaggeration is a key element of the visuals, with extreme angles and contrasting colors dominating the medium. The way something looks, too, helps to highlight a specific trait, characteristic, or attribute of itself. Examples of this include Senketsu\u2019s design, Honn\u014dji Academy\u2019s castle-like appearance and, yes, even Satsuki\u2019s glorious eyebrows. Further, facial expressions are well designed and closely mimic their intended emotion, something lesser animated series fail to do properly.\\n\\n\r\nThough largely aesthetically pleasing and well done, there is a noticeable issue with the animation in how largely inconsistent it can be at times, notably in the first half of the series. There is a big difference between making something look bad for comedy and just dropping the ball. Certain scenes look downright laughable, with others showing very little effort or proficient animation technique. Fortunately, the scenes were the quality was really bad are few and far between, and by the middle of the series they disappear almost completely.\\n\\n\r\nA clever thing to mention about the animation is how most characters display a unique animation style compared to others. Nui Harime, for instance, is animated weightlessly, delicately breaking the laws of physics, likely to represent her mental disconnect. Mako, especially during her monologues, moves very rapidly, often frame to frame, likely to mimic her erratic and nonsensical disposition. Ragyo (and Satsuki to an extent) always moved with an air of regal authority, complementing their personalities and positions well.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the show is certainly one of its best attributes. I found that pretty much each character\u2019s voices aptly fit the character they represented. Ry\u016bko\u2019s voice was properly gruff for a rebellious tomboy of her stature, with Satsuki and Ragyo Kiry\u016bin\u2019s well dignified, even haughty. I did not experience the show through the dubbed version, so I can\u2019t speak for its quality, though subs before dubs!\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the soundtrack, I\u2019m actually pretty impressed how engaging and well-orchestrated it was. Most of the best tracks are the character themes, specifically Ragyo Kiry\u016bin\u2019s \u201cBlumenkranz\u201d and Nui Harime\u2019s section within \u201dKi\u308b\u53adKiLL\u201d. Ira Gamagori and Nonon Jakuzure\u2019s themes are also well worth mention. So many of them fit their characters like a glove, succeeding well as a theme.\\n\\n\r\nThough slightly repetitious during some episodes, themes are generally well organized and spread out to retain their powerful presence. Tonal shifts are aptly expressed through the usage of specific themes as well, more so than visuals at times.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill also features two separate openings and endings, each changing at the \u201cmid-season\u201d point of Episode 15. Personally, \u201cAmbiguous\u201d (the second OP) and \u201cGomenne, Iikoja Irarenai\u201d (the first ED) are the better of their respective categories, though all four are well-performed both visually and aurally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAs is generally the case with exceptional animes, Kill la Kill offers a strong and memorable cast of characters. I took issue with very few, mostly supporting or one-shot type characters, with the majority of recurring characters retaining a high level of relevancy and distinction.\\n\\n\r\nRy\u016bko and Satsuki, our protagonist and deuteragonist, respectively, are fantastic characters in their own right. The two serve as each other\u2019s foil, with Ry\u016bko\u2019s unruly and impetuous disposition and Satsuki\u2019s refined and calculating temperament creating a strong, natural tension. Both grow quite a bit throughout the series that gives them that evolving quality every good character demands. A surprising development later in the plot reveals a better understanding regarding the two characters that presents an interesting dynami, further enriching their quality.\\n\\n\r\nMako serves as the show\u2019s comic relief, but at times proves herself as a valuable member of a cast. Hyperactive, loyal, and somewhat dense, she shines by being Ry\u016bko\u2019s \u201crock\u201d, being of assistance whenever she needs. It\u2019s quite comical at times how even she can defuse extremely tense and unforgiving situations by her frequent \u201ccharade\u201d monologues in which she assumes a spotlight and explains a certain situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe Elite Four, Satsuki\u2019s personal guard, is one of the best supporting character groups I\u2019ve experienced. Composed of the stalwart Ira Gamagori, cocky Uzu Sanageyama, cheeky Nonon Jakuzure, and observant Houka Inumuta, the four prove themselves as engaging, interesting characters beyond the initial purpose Satsuki\u2019s loyal \u201cgoons\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a variety of other characters that are fantastic as well. Ragyo Kiry\u016bin, Satsuki\u2019s mother, is vain, luxurious, and eerily discomforting. Aikuro Mikisugi is Ry\u016bko\u2019s homeroom teacher with with a seriously stripping fetish. Nui Harime, Grand Couturier of Ragyo\u2019s conglomerate, REVOCS, is a freaky sociopath with a taste for pink. Keep an eye out for them, as they each play influential roles later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill\u2019s weaves an imaginative concept, compelling character design, and exciting pace into a fantastically crafted series. Unless you\u2019re not a fan of shows that are fairly wacky, purposely over-the-top, or inherently nonsensical, there is no reason that you wouldn\u2019t find yourself having a good time. You won\u2019t be able to help the temptation to strip after watching, though, as you come to learn that clothes may never be trusted.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAh, la vie est juste dr\u00f4le.\u201d / \u201cAh, life is just so amusing.\u201d -Ragyo Kiry\u016bin",

The whole clothing this was nice and original, new music to me but on one hand almost wasn't enough and on the other hand, GOD DAMN first time I've ever seen something like that.\r\nEach character has a easy to understand and short backstory, which makes the whole anime go faster, therefore reducingthe filler episodes and providing golden content.\\n\\n\r\nThe environment itself is fun, keeping the real world but having their own island offshore was a great idea, allowing imagination flow and meddle with the art style that was totally appropriate with the whole setting (feat. bowl cut bois)\\n\r\nbtw listening to Ragyou's theme while writing this\\n\\n\r\nI think what got me the most was the ending, I was totally satisfied and could not have thought of any other ending for an anime like this, therefore maxing out my enjoyment for Kill La Kill and meaning I had to eat the whole series in only two days, making me sad it's over but at the same time happy with the way it ended on it's highest note, true climax.\\n\\n\r\nAfter taking some time to think about myself, I came to the conclusion that the second opening is straight up outstanding and should not be taken lightly for it is as some may say a masterpiece, the chorus hits hard with the strength pumping animations and goes straight to the point. Pure satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\n\"highly recommend.\"\\n\\n\r\n-Dips",

            "content": "What even is Kill la Kill?  It's a question I wouldn't be the first to ask \u2013 you can wonder whether or not it's a parody, and either way whether or not that's a good thing.  If it's supposed to be played straight, is it too much and too parodical?  Or if it's a parody, does it take itself too seriously, or is that 'deadpan delivery' of the alleged parody necessary for such a thing to be good or brilliant.\r\nFrankly, there's a degree to which Kill la Kill doesn't even feel real.  I watched the whole thing, all 24 episodes, andeven now I'm not entirely convinced that it could exist, much less of any theory as to what the show actually is.  It seems like what I would have guessed anime to be before actually watching any anime, the distilled essence of American misunderstandings of what the genre is all about.  Family unfriendly violence, check.  Family unfriendly fanservice, check.  Sanity unfriendly plot, check.  Bizarre concepts of a world, check.  Bizarre and often exaggerated imagery, check.  Bizarre talks about bizarre philosophy that you're not sure if you're supposed to identify with or take to be applicable to anything resembling the real world, check.  This is the anime your mom warned you about, ironically made somewhere in the ballpark of 20 years after a viewer such as myself would have been warned off.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Kill la Kill?  Kill la Kill is excess.  Everything about it is over the top, frenzied, and taken to extremes.  The action and violence are driven almost to the point of nonsense where every character can sport gallons of high-pressure blood to be sprayed from wounds or orifices on demand.  The fanservice is above and beyond, a world where a character in the nude could be less fanservice-y than certain characters in certain getups, and just to go the extra mile they integrate it fully into the plot.  The world is excessive, a universe where even the smallest issue can be made into fodder for combatitive powers or ideological conflict; Kill la Kill is not content to merely exaggerate the importance of any element it includes for any character, it has to revel in doing so, and let the universe revolve around each and every one for as long as they're standing.  The writing and acting are excessive too, a level of straight-faced melodrama that would make the grandest of overacters blush is brought to every scene, every line, straddling the line between something beautiful for its grandeur and something gaudy for its pretension at the same.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Kill la Kill?  Kill la Kill is shameless.  Every moment is presented without apology, or even the idea that such might be desirable.  This is a show that's utterly unafraid to bear itself to the world.  It doesn't mind exposing failures of animation where it seems a slow pan over a concept sketch must make do.  It willingly reveals its insanity, and from the first frame to the last is utterly bald-faced with the frantic, overflowing dynamism that is both its primary draw and its greatest weakness.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is Kill la Kill?  Kill la Kill is a frenzied avalanche of bodies and blood.  Kill la Kill is a freight train shot out of a railgun, filled with high explosives and nudity.  Kill la Kill is an orgiastic spectacle that makes \u201cmaking no sense\u201d its thing, makes sense of that, and somehow owns every moment.  Kill la Kill is, somehow, utterly true to itself by being everything and nothing at once, simultaneously absolutely superficial and infinitely earnest.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill just is.\\n\\n\r\nNever before have I wished for the ability to review something without applying some number summary, because never before have I encountered something that simply can't be rated in a numerical sense.  Everything about Kill la Kill starts at a 10/10 and then goes to eleven.  Everything about Kill la Kill starts at 1/10 and somehow slips to zero.  I can't recommend it.  I can't not recommend it.  You'll love it.  You'll hate it.  If you know what you're getting into, which you should by now, you should be able to piece together how you'll feel at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, how did I arrive at final numbers?  I decided to get off the ride (easier said than done) and look rationally at what I could.  The music was amazing, and the voice acting was always pitch perfect \u2013 every line was overacted, but they were meant to be overacted, and larger than life, so it fits.  On the other hand the art, while creative, suffers badly from a budget that clearly didn't cover their vision, so it's kind of all over the place.  It looks nice, but you do notice the cut corners.  The characters are loud and mostly nice to have around, while the story is, frankly, a chaotic mess, and even if it's supposed to be a chaotic mess that makes no sense I kind of have to hold that against the show.  As for the question of how much I enjoyed Kill la Kill?  Well, that's the hard one to rate.  In the end, while every minute delivered exactly what it was supposed to, I can't say that it wasn't occasionally hard to watch for one reason or another.  Certainly, I don't see myself going back for seconds any time in the near future, so I guess that gives it a low mark?  All the same, that's not out of distaste so much as fatigue.  Watching Kill la Kill was difficult because it was so grand in its madness, so absolute in its excess, and that's not the kind of experience you want to or can tap often.  I'd say I enjoyed it but... it also took a lot out of me.  This isn't a show that just gives, it wants your blood, your adrenaline in return.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to truly escape from a sane and rational world, if you think you can handle it, if this sounds at all like something that would make you happy, I'd give it a watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPointless Score Breakdown\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 6-ish",

            "content": "If there is an anime which I never would have thought that I would enjoy, without a doubt that anime would be Kill La Kill. I never released that I loved over-the-top-action until I saw Kill la Kill! Kill la Kill introduced me to the wonderfully insane worlds of FLCL, Panty and Stocking, Gurren Lagann and One Punch Man. Here is my completely subjective and biased review on one of my favorite anime series ever!\r\nStory \u2013 8/10\r\nHow does one fight an army of sentient clothing bent on the extinction of humanity? Why an army of nudists of course!\r\nIf that line isn\u2019t enough to at leastdraw your interest towards the series, I don\u2019t know what will. My initial thoughts regarding the anime were extremely negative. I found the series annoying, because of the absurdity and in-your-face fan service of the first few episodes. Luckily my arrogant self still continued watching the anime and boy how glad am I about how wrong I was. As the series continued I found myself completely forgetting about the fan service and was simply enthralled at the insanity of Kill la Kill\u2019s crazy plot. Even though the plot of the anime happens to be completely serious, it never stopped being any less fun to watch. The \u2018filler\u2019 episodes in the beginning of the anime felt pointless, but they ended up being useful in the end as they developed the central protagonist and hyped up the oncoming insanity called storytelling. Even though Kill la Kill\u2019s plot is all over the place, it made complete sense in the story\u2019s setting. Some of the best moments in the series didn\u2019t even come from the great fight scenes but instead for characters like Ryoko whom one can sympathize with. The only problem I had with Kill la Kill\u2019s plot were the two scenes between Satsuki and Ragyu. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is one of studio Triggers first anime series, and it is most certainly one of their best creations to date. The environments in the anime are made from vivid color usage and had told a story of the world in which the series takes place. Because of the insanity of the plot, the fight scenes were equally insane. All the fights were brilliantly choreographed and they emitted that very important factor called: fun. CGI is used to enhance fight scenes and environments by making it a secondary element in the animation process, unlike many other modern anime series that tend to take CGI usage overboard by using it as a central element. Ryoko and the rest of the characters have designs remnisant of western cartoon series and was an excellent choice for the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like Kill la Kill, I highly recommend that you go listen to the anime\u2019s soundtrack. Just like the main plot, it is pure insanity. The OST contains a huge variety of tracks for the various action scenes and the more emotional ones, all whom are brilliantly performed. My favorite tracks are those which were sung in English, because those in particular made a huge impact in the situations which they were used for, for me at least. Fights scenes become even more enjoyable to watch, because of the great soundtrack which complemented each fight brilliantly. Kill la Kill\u2019s English dub is pretty good. Most of the voice actors are a great fit for the characters they play. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how fun it must have been to take part in voice acting the anime!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill has many excellent aspects and one of them is a diverse and colorful cast of characters. Few anime manage to have a cast of characters as fun to watch \u2013 and hate \u2013 as Kill la Kill. It is weird to see a female main character who actual ends up being a sympathetic and interesting character, especially in the modern anime industry. Ryuuko Matoi is a teenage girl on a mission to avenge her father\u2019s death. What she finds on her journey might be more than she initially expected. The most appealing part of Ryoko as a character is her inner struggle to accept who she is. It made for some truly emotional moments, especially when you are invested in the character. Satsuki has a personality which is the contrast of Ryuuku\u2019s personality. Where Ryoko is a laid-back badass without a care in the world, Satsuki on the other hand has a more rigid approach to life. Because of this contrast, I found the dialogue between the characters extremely interesting as their viewpoints and ideologies are complete polar opposites of one another. Mako Mankanshoku is Ryoko\u2019s closest friend who serves as an emotional support for Ryoku and comic relieve. In my opinion, Mako had the potential to become one of the biggest annoyances in anime, because of her primary role of comic relieve, but fortunately the writers had the right idea to make this idiot a lovable one. Other characters who I really enjoyed are the Mankanshoku family, The Elite Four and Senketsu. Kill la Kill also happens to have one of my favorite antagonists ever, as Ragyu is one of the few antagonist I can think of who are rotten to the core. As much as I hate her actions, I can\u2019t help but admire the fact that she is evil for no other reason than being evil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t anything about Kill la Kill which I find boring. You have a wacky plot which keeps you invested, brilliantly fight scenes and animation, a truly kick-ass soundtrack and a few fantastic characters to boot. What is there not to enjoy?\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs long as you avoid the two scenes between Satsuki and Ragyu, Kill la Kill is a great anime. It has everything you would expect from a great anime. I highly recommend the anime for anybody in search of a fun anime and those looking for another over-the-top action anime. I promise you that you won\u2019t be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

            "content": "Honestly this may be a love or hate anime. Each category (barring sound/music) can either be a turn on or turn off for any given person.\r\nObviously, I fkin loved each and every moment of it.\r\n-one thing before i begin: About the ecchi. Please. For goodness sake don't skip watching it just because it has ecchi. Yes some parts are borderline hentai but please. Soon after 5 or more episodes you'll find it natural and not that bothering anymore. Don't act like almost seeing tiddies will distract you from what an awesome anime this is (unless you some horny 12 yo that is then fap away)-long review below - Last Overview section is a hyper condensed TL;DR if you want that \\n\r\n-time for section for section breakdown\\n\\n\r\n!!! Recently, their has been many visually pleasing animes by either Kyoani, ufotable, and A-1. My eyes have gotten so used to these \"realistic\" or \"insanely detailed\" animations that I kinda... lost feeling for it. Now I look at \"mediocre\" animations styles and I'm like meh the story better be good shit, since they are either lacking in talent or budget to be able to imitate the top dogs at animation. No creativity in animation(everything is too good basically) these days is the TL;DR for this section.\\n\\n\r\nSomehow Kill La Kill and studio TRIGGER defies this at any given time I guess. They basically go \"fuck the norm\" and pull off whatever the fuck their minds can conceive. Which was a great ass breather for me. So thanks KLK.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>Story: yea ok this was slightly lacking. too simple for some in fact. But hey each to their own. I felt that this show wanted a basic premise that could be easily twisted around. And it did exactly that. Taking the revenge plot on a wild ride. Subplots weren't the deepest or most interesting shit but everything still kinda built on each other. Character dev. is a bit lacking  for side characters tho hence the 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n>Art: hell ya. I practically watched this show for the goddamn animation style. This animation series has its heart and soul combined with its out of the world animation. As the characters say, nothing makes sense and thats what's special. Some of the things they do in KLK just aren't possible in those hyper realism animes these days. Instead of imitating IRL, it seeks to further it's own domain of art, anime. There are things you can express in anime that just defies any logic of real life. And that's good. KLK exploits this to the max with all their perspectives and fourth wall breaking.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>Sound: 10/10. I swear if you haven't heard KLK's soundtrack you missing out on a lot. My man Sawano making everything fit together perfectly with all the drops at the transformations. Also, each characters distinct theme can be heard each time they enter the screen. This really reinforces certain actions with certain scenes, kinda like how you hear Imperial March and you see Vader strolling towards you. \\n\\n\\n\r\n>Character: Each character has such unique character design. With Mako being like a comedic schoolgirl, her looks are distinctly different from Ryuuko. Each character's design in either looks or clothes amplifies their very personalities and again this is in stark contrast with \"realistic\" animes. \\n\\n\\n\r\n>Enjoyment: I think 90% of show I had either goosebumps or a smile on my face. Goddamn \"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?\"  for real, each scene was animated for maximum enjoyment whether its supposed to be fighting or comedic, everything was great.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>Overall: Some people might hate the ecchi, some may hate the art, and some may hate the story. Sometimes though, I feel like some animes are to be watched with your feet kicked back and relaxed without analyzing each and every frame. KLK won't make you question \"What is life?\" or \"What is human morality\" afterwards, but sure as hell it's gna leave a big ass smile on your face. :)\\n",

            "content": "Hyper stylized action with little substance to bring this show's fibers to... life  ~_^\r\nKill La Kill is a show that starts off with plenty of steam and then falters to the finish line. It's driven by a crew of characters that that lack the depth and dimension needed to carry this show beyond the 'filler feels stage' (i.e. watching the show and getting the sensation that you're watching a lot of fluff even though it's somehow relevant to the story). Amongst all of the flash and pizazz, the show loses itself in a story that is predictable and the very opposite of compelling.\\n\\n\r\nRevenge.  That's the name of the game and that motto runs deep in the veins of this show.  Of course, at first, you're intrigued because you want to see which angles the shows will take.  After the first 6-7 episodes, you quickly realize that it's a hot and cold show.  One episode seems to get you amped for an event and then the following episode completely veers you into a different direction that seems...  uninteresting.  \\n\\n\r\nYes, there's a multitude of action and yes, there's a ton of near-Hentai fan service but...  for what purpose?  While I usually enjoy a show that goes a little overboard, it needs to have characters that keep you involved and which can keep the show somewhat grounded (i.e. Gurren Lagann).  Kill la Kill fails to deliver anything in that department and instead, you're wanting each episode to cut to the chase. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to choose between a random, but attractive stranger taking their sweaty sock and placing it over their hand; then inserting that socked-hand into my mouth and screaming at me in Tagalog or watching this show....  \\n\\n\r\nGIVE ME THE SOCK!!!",

            "content": "I watched Kill la Kill with friends and I was very mellow about the whole gig from the start. It starts off with a bombastic action scene, which is almost always a way to turn me off: if you have such boring characters that instead of introducing them you'd rather immediately give me a fight between a guy I know nothing about and another guy I know nothing about, then I don't care and I want to drop it.\r\nI actually got disinterested around episode 6 and episode 7 got me back into the fold due to it being the first episode with an actual clearmessage. It's only after I watched the entire anime once and got to see it again that I started to appreciate it for what it really is.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 : To be honest I said to my friends around episode 4 or 5 that \"Ryuko and Satsuki will end up having sex before the end of the anime or they'll end up being long lost sisters\".  And I could also predict lots of little elements in the story just from the storytelling and the setups. It's another story in a school(although there are none of the usual school mechanics, no classes, no making friends, nothing but Ryuko, Satsuki, and each of their gangs), lots of things are predictable, and I also predicted the main twist in the story. So overall bleh.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 : I don't care what anyone says about the overabundance of cheap still images and obviously quickly-drawn animations, I find the art to work absolutely perfectly here. With the use of CGI, stills and animated scenes, the art in general works as well as can be. Facial expressions, body language, general locations, style, everywhere the style is flamboyant and expressive, except when it's willingly meant to look sort of ugly and bland. Kill la Kill works especially well as a style without substance anime, and its style certainly gains a ton from it. The apparent simplicity hides a richness with lots of content shoved into many scenes and where you often see a thing the second time that you missed on the first time. The abuse of a comedic drawing style can sometimes do wonders to emphasize the events happening or the characters' feelings and that also is both something in semi-bad taste and something that works perfectly for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nA less favorable point is the fights: there are many, they have shaky cam syndrome, they generally are technically weak and although the characters personalities are the centerpiece of the clashes, it doesn't excuse the generally very poor choreographies and uninteresting clash and clash and clash and clash fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10 : Excellent soundtrack, I've listened to a lot of the songs outside of the anime, especially Ryuko Matoi's main theme, Before my Body is Dry. The sound design overall also does an excellent job, and in general the voice acting is as good as it gets.\\n\r\nNuuuuudisto Beeaaaaach~i\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7 : Surprisingly for an anime carried by its characters this is quite weak, but to be honest none of them shine, not even Ryuko. Ryuko's quest is an easily relatable vengeance one, most of the other characters have their backstories given through flashbacks, none of them are that memorable, in general they all work well and are enjoyable in the context of the manga, but I don't find any of them to warrant a particularly deep look. I have a very soft spot for the earnest and open pervertedness of Aikuro Mikisugi, but he's more of a parody than a good character.\\n\r\nThey work well and are enjoyable, like almost everything in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8 : I'm tempted to give a 9 but it would need better fights. Or less fights. In general as I said KLK works AS an enjoyable anime. Its story is very bleh and I didn't think highly of characters, or themes, or anything. Nothing in this anime shines particularly bright apart from some parodies and the gorgeous flamboyant style. Yet this got me very, very well, it got under my skin very efficiently. Finishing it the first time I felt like it had been mostly nice and maybe I'd watch again. Finishing it again, I felt like i had seen a really great and fun anime, despite its shallowness. KLK is meant to be enjoyed beyond anything else. The style is meant to be enjoyed, the characters are meant to be enjoyed, the setup is meant to be enjoyed, nothing in this anime is there for the sake of anything but enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the efforts some animes can give to making something powerful or memorable for themselves, or something really funny, Kill la Kill comes off as not doing that much effort to be enjoyed. It's better than that. It seems to enjoy itself and to want to enjoy itself as much as possible, and be enjoyed by others. It's the kind of project that was done by people who loved it and went all out with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 : Let's be clear on one point, if you are into anime for a story or depth, KLK will never deliver and has no intentions to. If some animes are about giving a good story thanks to animation, KLK wants to be an anime and be great at it. This is an animator/anime maker's wet dream, not a profound outlook on anything. Being myself someone who enjoys story and doesn't really care about animation, I wanted to drop it after episode 6. And despite episode 7 bringing me back, it's only once I knew what the show was out there for that I really got to appreciate it for what it is. The feeling of it being mostly empty and just about the flamboyant style intertwined with parody was something I loathed, but I ended up treasuring it, especially after watching KLK a second time in its entirety.\\n\\n\r\nThe second go almost completely changed my mind from \"this is kinda fun but I'm not all that interested\" to \"this may be an empty shell but it's so much fun\". The shallowness of the story and simple characters may have been a turn-off at first when I was expecting something out of them, but when I went again knowing exactly what to expect, understanding the finer points of the parody and the more subtle aspects of the story and world(which can only be truly well understood after the first watch, which is probably a design flaw), and appreciating the fun for the sake of fun, the craziness for the sake of craziness, just expecting nothing but a smile on my face and some happy insanity, I enjoyed myself immensely and had a great time, especially with the first half, not that the second is worse but it's very fight-centric and fights are still bad.\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill may never reach the heavens and it may forever be just a fun and bombastic anime, but I ended up truly loving it for what it was, and I'll watch it again and treasure it.",

Most of it is kinda weak ie they don't resolve Ryuko's original motivation behind finding who killed her father. But after around the second half of the show the story kinda picks up. But you don't watch Kill la Kill for story. The world they built on the other hand, is very interesting, filled with an interesting premise, an interesting \r\nArt: Far and away the best animation and art design I've ever seen in an anime. The characters are easily recognizable and very interesting to look at. The showis beautiful. Period. Absolutely gorgeous. The world they created is amazing to look at. The first scene of the show, where they show a panning shot over the entire school really stuck with me, and really shows how beautiful and unique the art style of the show really is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Never have I ever listened to a ost that captivated me such to the point that 1) it moved it's already spectacular fight scenes to legendary 2) the songs are good enough to be listened to on their own and 3) the songs really gel well with the story and the characters they are assigned to ie Gamagori and Nui's songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While a few of the characters are boring, the extended kiryuin family are all quite interesting. But every character does feel unique and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While the show isn't a wonderfully written novel by any stretch of the imagination, it's cathartic, enjoyable action scenes and comedic interactions between most of the characters really makes the show so enjoyable that anyone who doesn't watch would remiss such a sensational show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Solid 10.

            "content": "So I'm starting  off this review by talking about another anime show, I was watching a little Darling in the Franxx, like I'm sure a lot of people are on this website currently and I started to remember a thought I had back when I first watched Kill La Kill a show that really makes me think deeply about a lot of issues. Like... Can humans and clothes coexist in a peaceful way? The answer as the show clearly shows us is they can't, which is why I'm writing this in the nude. The second thing it makes me think about is the natureof parody and satire and this is actually something I think about a lot. You might ironically say that I take the idea of parody and satire very seriously. So what about this show makes me wonder about that? Well, because I'm the king of tangents and needless comparisons, lets talk about yet another show before we even leave this first paragraph. So One Punch Man (OPM) is about a hero who can defeat any opponent with one punch, hence the name of the show. If you grew up watching shows like Dragon Ball Z like I did or other long winded Shonen shows that came out before or since, the subversion or parody inherent in OPM is obvious, whereas some of the battles in those shows could go on and on and on, the joke in OPM is that the battles are already over before they even start. There is also almost a \"blue balling\" element to the hero's reaction to all this, like he'd like to have an epic opponent like heros in other shows but he cant. So the challenge inherent in a premise like this is how you make the show interesting when you can't milk the most obvious content an action show can milk which is the over the top and elaborate violence and the large amount of in built filler a lot of this brings. How it does this in OPM case is somewhat by sleight of hand you see. Only the first few battles actually involve the hero, a lot of the battles after the premise is set up involve him watching other people attempt to be heroes and then he is used as a last minute Deus Ex Machina to sweep up the trash once the traditional heroes aren't able to do much. The way this setup works is we essentially have a traditional action show by the end of the series, as the hero slowly recedes into the background becoming the framework rather than the actual driving point of the show. So the subversion, inverts back on itself and we're back to where we started with a regular action show in place. So what starts out as an interesting premise about a hero who comically can't find a worthy opponent to the extent that he beats people more easily than you stub your toe is long winding pathway back to a regular action show. This funny premise might lead us to an interesting place eventually, just reverted back into everyday action trope laziness. Granted, it's not a complete waste as some of the main character's reactions to all this are interesting, but the show never feels quite as interesting as it does from its initial starting premise, in fact it get's slightly more mundane and typical of its genre as the show goes on. I seem to recall that I was reviewing another show and I don't quite get what any of this has to do with ummm... What was the show I was reviewing again? Oh yeah Kill La Kill. \\n\r\nAh, so now I remember why I said all that, you see I think Kill La Kill tried to one up a show like OPM before it even existed by being a complete farce of action and mech'ish type shows of its kind not just in one way but a few. It tried to parody the overuse of sex in these shows, it tried to parody the over the top violence and the overly dramatic reasons for it and it also tried to parody the high school/secondary school'ish elements these kind of shows have taken on. Now, this is where it get's tricky and where, I ask the fundamental question that will be my whole reason for doing this review. Is there a point when parody goes so far with its own conclusions and inversions that it essential steps back into being the thing it was attempting to parody in the first place? The more I have thought about this show over the years, the more this question has kind of put a an inescapable haze over it and I'd like to look at this show through the three lanes of parody I suggested it was trying to do above, the sex, the action/drama and the school life elements. Wish me luck friends. \\n\\n\r\nSo dudes and dudettes put on some mood music, bring out the candles and turn out the lights. I'm about to give you some sexual analysis in the most loving way possible. So I talked about fanservice a little bit before in my Kantai review and I'm not adverse to the wiles of a \"cute\" character as the kids say. I mean I've seen some sad bears in my time. I burrowed the booru's if you catch my drift. What I am adverse to though, is a poorly written character, with poorly written motives whose one appeal is their looks. When characters are badly written it is my professionally amateurish opinion that the rest of the story by extension is badly written, because if you can't believe or relate to the characters, then you can't take their actions seriously in the world and hence there is no real reason to care about the story or anything that happens. Well, I wouldn't say Kill La Kill's characters one appeal is of the sexual variety, they all have pretty grounded well utilized reasons for what they do in the show's universe and everyone's role is pretty well established within the show, with enough directness that I understand who they are but with just enough additional information and personality that they feel real enough and not like signs with exposition written on their faces. So if I can complement the show this much then why did I bring this up at all? Well, if you remember this show is supposed to be a parody and one of the thing's it supposed to be parodying is fanservice and the overly sexual nature of shows like this. The parody goes so far in this regard that there is a consistent storytelling element of some clothes being evil symbiotic creatures from space that try to take you over. Like the Symbiotes in the Marvel universe Venom, Carnage, etc. For the shows additional credit I do think a lot of good and even memorable humor is gained from this. The problem is  it starts to go really over the top, really fast with this, to the point that a lot of the main characters are basically naked for half the shows entire running time. What starts out a funny joke actually just becomes a non stop rendition of the thing it was supposed to be parodying. I mean the main characters costume designs constantly show almost everything. There aren't many action shows that show this much nudity on a consistent basis. I'm not trying to give every other show a pass in this regard either, there are a lot of movies, video games and other shows animated and not, that have women essentially walking around in cropped bathing suits of various types and we're all supposed to pretend this is a real outfit they would wear in an otherwise sane universe. I'm also not saying nudity or sexual content is the worst thing ever. I think it has a place in storytelling and it is part of the biological experience, so I'm not so much against it from a prudish or moral standpoint, but more from a bad or lazy storytelling standpoint. What I am saying is that when you're trying to subvert something or parody it, there comes a point where if you go too far with it, you might end up just being a more extreme version of the thing you were trying to parody. I would say this is true of Kill La Kill's sexual content and sexual chocolate. It goes so over the top that I think it bends back into itself and just set a new low bar standard for anime to try achieve on the fanservice levels and believe me those animators always want to limbo lower and lower when it comes to women's clothing. So while I thought the characters were good and the show did to its credit utilize the sexual content in a humorous way, I couldn't help but feel a lot of the time that the \"parody\" was just an excuse to be an even more extreme version of the norm only it got less funny and more desperate seeming as the show dragged on. The clothes or lack thereof just stopped being \"ridiculous\" and they started being \"ridiculous.\" \\n\r\nThere is also another problem with an overruse of \"fanservice\" in this way. If I was standing next to you in a crowd and I pulled your pants down, it would be shocking. Maybe humorously shocking given the right context. If I pulled your pants down and you just stood there like that in the crowd with no reaction for forty minutes it would just start to become banal and weird in a bad way. Alternatively you might have that reaction because it's not shocking and maybe having your pant's pulled down is not the worst thing that could happen within our universe. It's not how thing's work here, but imagine for a second that it did. Now imagine a universe is setup where nudity is the norm and wearing clothes is bad... You know exactly like KIll La Kill's premise and you start to see how the premise undervalues the use of fanservice by making it another everyday facet of reality and hence boring in it's use. The \"sexual\" element's of it's universe are weird to us because it's not how are reality works, but the more you watch a show like this the more it starts to erode this schock or alt. reality appeal by pelting you with it constantly. Imagine for a second that reality worked the way it does in porn... Don't imagine it that much! Keep your hands up until the review is over. Being a pizza man or a plumber means you get \"serviced\" for every place you \"service.\" Being a doctor or a nurse means it's perfectly acceptable to start doing sexual things to your patients, rather than result in multiple lawsuits that will probably get your medical license revoked and end with sexual assault charges. Imagine every life event could result in pixel perfect high resolution \"action\" the way it does in the reality of these fine pieces of art. Well if it was real you wouldn't need to imagine it as it would probably make sex a boring everyday thing if reality really worked this way. You see these things work the way they do in our world because these are fantasies that don't happen very often. For most people every day life events do not result in orgasmic bliss with absolute strangers for no reason at all. If thing's actually did work the way they do in the reality of these brilliant films we wouldn't have any need for this genre as we generally don't make a big hullabaloo in media about things that happen on a constant basis. There aren't a whole lot of anime about breathing, pumping gas, filing your taxes and taking out the garbage.  In part because the mundane doesn't need to be put on a pedestal, it already is the pedestal, the shocking thing the thing we never see or do is supposed to be what's on display for all to see. \\n\r\nThis is why \"fanservice\" is supposed to be appealing. I generally don't get to see a person's pantsu very often, so it's kind of a pleasant and vicariously embarassing shock when I see it happen to someone in anime. If an anime was made where the universe was setup around a woman who cant stop showing her pantsu though on a near constant basis.. I'm not sure the fanservice premise alone would make for an interesting 12 episodes of this. In fact I'm dead certain it wouldn't. Similarly Kill La Kill drives this point into the ground, where most importantly it is no longer funny, shocking, or appealing. It just \"is.\" \\n\\n\r\nSo now we talk about the violence. So if you look at my favorite shows on this site and despite my harping against it in my Ergo Proxy review, I do like me some action, in fact, I would say a lot of my favorite shows in anime come from this genre so far. Violence feel's good on a visceral level and I can see why many people choose to depict it in the media. So unlike the characters that I think are about as well written as they can be given the premise and this world, I don't really think the action in this show is that great. I haven't seen Vegeta fight Freeza or more accurately see Vegeta get his ass kicked in the Namek Saga for almost ten years now, but I remember that fight pretty well, in fact I remember a lot of fights from that show. I also remember fights, from shows like Macross Plus pretty well, even though I haven't seen that show since the early 00's. I just rewatched some fight's from Kill La Kill a week ago for this review and aside from the fact that I remember that certain people fought each other, I can't recall much of what happened in each fight. Now parody's and things that can be ground down to \"jokes\" have a common in built defense about their quality in that anyone defending it can just say \"It's a joke, it's not meant to be as good as the real thing. Stop taking things so seriously!\" Well, I don't really buy into that way of thinking, I think in order to be a parody of something you have to be a good version of that something first and then you apply or gain humor out of the setting naturally. If you take the humor out of Space Ball's or Shaun of The Dead you still have a pretty good space action film and a pretty good copy of early Romero Zombie films with some nice drama added in. I'm not saying they would be the beloved film's that they're without humor, but they would be perfectly functional film's in their genre. Contrast that with some of the \"Scary Movie\" films and their bastard now thankfully dead children \"The movie\" movies. These just weren't good renditions of horror movies or anything really. So the humor applied didn't stick or work, because there weren't any real characters or context for the humor to apply to. When Weird Al goes to write a parody of a song he doesn't do so by singing off key and having the band fart out notes from their instruments. He aims to have a good cover of the song first and then he add's his own lines, jokes and ideas in. I also think this is true of other types of subversions like when a show or movie attempts to transcend itself and become something else entirely. Neon Genesis Evangelion established itself as a good mech show before it started to subvert people's expectations about that genre and anime in general, I've often seen people criticize the end of the series, but most people agree at least that up to that point it was a good entry in the genre it was attempting to be in up to that point. I mean I've seen some people like diehard Gundam fans and things of that nature who don't like it or think it's overrated, but most people in general think it was a good mech show up until the end. So I think the action in Kill La Kill needed to be a lot better and more memorable than it was. If you're going to parody action, you have to have good action first and it has to be a part of the show that I find endearing enough to care about the humor associated with it and I just don't think it was. \\n\r\nSimilar to my thoughts on the sex, the violence start's off funny and some of the exposition before it can be humorous especially from Mako and Ira. I would say given the immediate paragraph above and the failing's of the shows action overall and taken in consideration with what I said about OPM much earlier, the concept of this show's parody of action is funny. There is a lot of overly drawn out action in anime, sometimes to a point of absurdity. I can very easily imagine a parody of this... Which is a problem when trying to parody it. The fact that some of these shows already are so ridiculous is what makes it hard to actually parody them, because it's hard to parody or be a subversion of something that is already ridiculous to begin with. In fact the easiest way to do this would not be to have more extreme action and violence, but rather to put these already heightened over exaggerated characters into less tense non-combat scenarios. The funniest part's of Kill La Kill are the part's that do this, the moment's before a battle and the school life aspects I'll talk about later tend to be the most genuinely funny moments of the show. In part because they're placing over the top action characters in a non-action setting for a moment. It's funny to see a character like Ryuko trying to live a normal life in the same way that it's funny to see Goku and Piccolo who are more powerful than most people on earth attempt and fail at doing something completely mundane like driving a car. What gets old fast though as a parody is seeing these characters, fight and fight and fight. The problem is, even if you craft well laid out jokes in the fighting scenarios the problem is are brains are also trying to take the shows plot and action seriously and the more I watch Kill LA Kill the less the action seems funny and it seems more like a lame amount of filler to a poorly written action show. \\n\r\nThis is exaggerated a bit by the fact that the show also tries to parody these types of shows over dramatization of the events involved. The problem is it does this a lot of the time by having the same stupid type's of overly dramatic plot that these types of shows have. Well, seemingly stupid I should say. You can hate Shonen show's and you can hate older mech type shows for being formulaic and cliche, but one way in which I will defend them is they tend to pace their over dramatization of event's out more than a show like Kill La Kill does in its highly condensed by comparison story. You see in making some of the battles as long as they do and building up their characters to ungodly levels of importance, they're trying to engage the audience by showing the importance of things in the worlds they create. So all this perceived fluff has a purpose, it builds things up in a way that wouldn't necessarily happen in real life. In real life most sword fights end in a minute or less, most fist fights are between opponents of uneven skill who are raging in a heated argument, they aren't long drawn out matches of skill between two ungodly powerful beings who plan each move with immaculate logic and grace. Most gun fire fights in a war aren't about skilled marksmanship and gunplay between equal opponents of merit, it's usually about firing large amounts of suppressive fire from automatic rifles and you target literally anything that looks slightly like a threat. If you see anything moving above your waist level after you yelled for everyone to duck, you shoot it without question.  The thing is, real life combat doesn't really offer us the drama and feelings of fairness and justice we crave from situations like this. It's about survival and pretty much only that to the extent that we deem it acceptable. There is something inherently unsatisfying to most people about a life lived only for survival, so through are stories and tales we give ourselves bigger more thematic reasons for why these circumstances have to exist. I think this has both positive and negative consequences for us as most delusions do, but those are bigger than the scope of this review. \\n\r\nSo the funniest subversion of the violence in these shows would be to go realistic for just a second. Maybe some big goon comes up to Ryuko is ready to fight the clothes off her and does a big dramatic speech about how he is the prince of all Saiyans and a blue eyes white dragon, then she immediately strikes them down with a sword. This is kind of like how the parody in OPM works at the start, but I think a better example of this is in a similar in concept show but that is a parody of western animation rather than eastern is the Venture Bros. In the Venture Bros they manage to make light of every aspect of western animations traditional penchant for over the top dramatics and violence, by having the characters, heroes and villains alike joining guilds that explain how you're supposed to act in certain situations. So being a villain or a hero is just another kind of job in this universe. Additional humor comes from the fact that not everyone is aware of this aspect of the world, so when a realistic person like Brock Samson with military experience is pitted against the shows fictional villains he actually bests them way too easily and the other characters get mad that he isn't \"playing along\" the way he should. You see being an overly dramatic mustache twirler is part of the bureaucracy of being a villain and the show counter balances how old this parody might get by having real villains and conflicts behind this facade that are much more threatening and less overly dramatic in their implementation. As well as a lot of other things that spice up this show's concept. You find that the worst villains in the show are like those in real life, not people concocting wacky over the top conspiracies behind the scenes, but people doing bad, but just boring enough things hidden in the details in plain sight that are the real villains. So Kill La Kill instead of just doing tropes from other anime action shows and playing them off to a \"T.\" Should have done more to subvert them, by either having some kind of conceit for why they exist or by doing something else entirely in their place that is funny given the situation they're in. \\n\r\nThis underlies a related facet of the show and I might as well get this tedious part of the review out of the way here, while I think the animation was certainly good at evoking humor and some of the characters did have a nice look to them even when clothed. I think on a whole the animation was kind of bad and it certainly didn't lend itself well to the type of large epic in scope action they were trying to convey with it. The characters also came off disjointed at times and poorly animated when in fast paced sequences. \\n\\n\r\nSo the High School elements... This is probably the part of the show I'm the most mixed on. As stated above in the action section I do like the juxtaposition of the action oriented characters in this setting, but much like the action I find this content on its own a little wanting. It's not good slice of life or high school drama content and unlike the other two things I have already talked about the parody elements of this aspect of the show are actually pretty thin to begin with. It kind of makes a little light of some of the school elements these shows have and how a seemingly normal school is somehow tied to a grandiose story. Aside from that it doesn't really do much and just like with the action the parody is so on the nose and overdone that I find that it just ends up being a worse version of these typical high school plots. What makes me a little on the fence about this is that unlike other anime shows, the characters are utilized well here and the lighter moment's of the show between battling do give us some good humor and character development. The problem is, that these elements never meet with the shows over the top rendition of action schlock to form a cohesive narrative that feel's both satisfying on a storytelling level and fit's its comedic nature. We're just kind of left with a vat of indiscernible sludge where a good story should be. I mean it's a funny tasting vat of indiscernible sludge and I can still stomach it to an extent, but it just doesn't go down easy. Food analogies, I know the internet loves these, just like you love harm to pets, pretension and the wrong use of comic sans.\\n\\n\r\nI think I have kind of touched upon this in all these sections, but I'll run the risk of belaboring the point a little here. I think all of the characters in this show are good and I enjoy them for their own sake. The problem is more the execution in applying them to this hackneyed setting. They just aren't fully utilized here and they hampered by the joke attempts at anime tropes like everything else. So in between me thinking about this show and not, I do remember that I like the characters and I kind of think fondly about it for a little bit before I start to remember all the bad details and everything around them. \\n\\n\r\nSo the sound, it exists. Ok, so after my last review I tried to consciously care about this element of the next thing I was reviewing more and I can say that I do think the voice acting both eastern and western fit well enough. Mako's western voice actor get's a little annoying at times, but it's not as overly abrasive and obnoxious as some other shows. Which is funny because her Japanese voice actor... <Looks at MAL page>  Hmmmmmmm. That voice, those looks... Forget everything I said in the rest of this review. This is the best show ever for this symmetry between character & VA, this women and her voice... I might die from an overabundance of irregular sized Doki Doki's, give me a second. S-so the music is pretty good for what it is but not that memorable. I think the first intro song to this show is a little uninspired and emotionally drained especially given this shows over the top content. The second one is a little bit better, but it doesn't quite catch what the show is about either. The sound in general is just kind of average. \\n\\n\r\nI can harp on things like sex and violence a bit for being too easy of a crutch in storytelling and how the added layer of parody has been often an excuse rather than a real justification for their existence, but at the end of the day I still really like both things and I can understand their use in a story. I would go as far to say that I don't think you can really be a fan of anime if you don't in some sense enjoy these things. I mean, if you didn't enjoy them, I would just have to sit here and ask \"Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?\" Over and over again. You'd have to be pretty masochistic to not like some amount of fan service and needless violence and be into this sort of thing. It would be like being a \"fan\" of horror films, but not liking gore, blood, scary things and grossness. Unlike the other three things I have reviewed so far I don't think this show is a complete dud, there is still something to be enjoyed about Kill La Kill aside from these over the top parody elements that I think end up inverting on themselves. The problem is what is enjoyable about it is the same as what's enjoyable about the thing's it's attempting to make light of in the first place. It never really comes to grips with using the humor as a way of transcending its own shallow genre and it never really escapes the tropes it's trying to subvert. So it just ends up somewhere in the middle. The \"joke\" becomes an excuse for lazy storytelling and by the end of the series I just think this show is a slightly worse version of other action shows, rather than a really good comedy that has those action elements at the core of its humor. Which is what I thought of OPM at the start, but with that show the regression back to the mean is more obvious because the parody element only comes into play through the \"one punch\" story telling element. I think Kill La Kill ultimately has the same problem as OPM. It's starts off with an interesting series of premises and slowly pulls them back inward, to the general norm of the genre. I fundamentally see Kill La Kill as a comedy and as a comedy, it's disappointing, but it does have other merits as stated with the characters. I can go in circles and circles saying I want to like more of this, but I don't all day but that's just how I feel. This show and writing the review in the nude did give me the confidence to plan a trip to a nude beach though and live my life's dream of being a \"model\" for art classes.  So I guess it was life changing in that sense... Ultimately, I do think parody can go awry and end up becoming what it was ultimately trying to be in the first place. So I answered my own question that I already knew the answer to in the first place.",

            "content": "Kill la Kill was the right hype train to hop on for fans looking for mindless fun and action. When you look at it from a critical point of view though, it's a slightly different story.\r\nSTORY\r\nI actually loved the story of Kill la Kill because I felt it was the best part of its 'parody' plan. Kill la Kill is a parody of modern anime, with all of its fanservice, skill names being read out in a fight, numbered group of villains, school life, transformation sequences, a huge plot that often has the fate of the world depending on a group of teenagers... Kill laKill's storyline is a great attempt to be the embodiment of all these elements and cliches, while being creative in its own way. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do so many people say that Kill la Kill was overrated? Some of it has to do with how Kill la Kill failed to be a parody halfway and just became that very anime that it was trying to make jokes of. This doesn't stop the great storytelling accompanied with a great soundtrack from keeping you hooked to the show. Besides, while people often criticise the middle portion of the show for not being very valuable to the overall plot, the conclusion to the story is an epic one that you can look forward to. (And I still liked the middle portion, just because it was fun to watch.)\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nKill la Kill's art and animation can be described best as 'inconsistent'. Like any other show with a badly managed budget, the first few episodes of Kill la Kill contain some impressive animation, fight scenes, background art and character art, but as the show goes on, the episodes are increasingly littered with amateurish animation and other lazy stuff. Fortunately for Kill la Kill the occassional bad animation and fights that end straight up in a still frame still somewhat contribute to the overall goofy easygoing atmosphere of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It also comes with the infamous \"Don't lose your way\" song and everyone's favourite \"Ping Pong Circulate\" track. It is seriously good, though. I struggle to come up with one bad thing to say about the soundtrack, the timings that they are played at during the events of the show, or anything. It accompanies the show's cast and events nearly perfectly. I personally found Satsuki's theme being overplayed just so slightly during the anime but that's alright because it's a fantastic track anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nI think all the other reviews talk plenty about the lackluster explanation for Ryuuko's motivation to avenge his dad, or Ragyou's plan to [spoilers]. These are some noticeable gaps in character development. However each character in the show is undeniably unique and attractive. The Four Devas, Ryuuko and Senketsu, Nudist Beach, the Kiryuuin family, the Mankanshoku family, and the rest of the city and the academy are all each portrayed carefully well, throughout all the episodes consistently. Rather than having arcs of several episodes to develop each character, they are all developed continuously, in small episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOne very important character in the show is Mako. She's not just there for the comedic value, but she really is one of the main characters who is weaved into the main plot and also acts as a deus ex machina who can interject in any situation, whether it be a serious neck-and-neck one or a goofy and funny one, and control the atmosphere of the whole scene. I found her character particularly interesting because of this, along with all her funny moments and the ship with Gamagoori.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIf you don't have fun while watching Kill la Kill, I would say you need to see a doctor. But that's just my personal opinion. My point is that Kill la Kill is an anime that is seriously trying so hard to be enjoyable it feels like being enjoyable is its only purpose. (And it succeeds!) You don't need to put much thought into it or understand everything. I recommend you don't overthink it while watching Kill la Kill because that removes some fun and instead reveals some critical mistakes in character development that you would rather not see.\\n\\n\r\nIts entertaining nature is the main reason why I cannot give Kill la Kill a lower score despite the mistakes it makes.",

Those who want to watch it because it's porn just don't, because it's not (not even close).

I can't really go into detail because it'll spoil some of the anime for you but I will tell you that it kept my interest. All I can say its that it starts out with a girl named Matoi Ryuuku goes on a journey to discover the secret of her father'sdeath and finds out stuff along the way, which mainly have to do how clothes are alive and evil with an orginization behind it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Well this is the holy grail of this anime, the art. Even though they blatantly throw fanservice (hell everyone is naked so I don't think this even counts as fanservice), you quickly forget about that because they make the most spectacular fights scenes. They also play around with the animation, heck I think these guys just wanted to draw instead of anything else really.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Some of the music i liked and some of it I didnt like. I don't like the main theme but what I really liked was the baddie's main theme song. As for the conversations, it feels like they're yelling a lot most of the time but that didnt bother me since they mostly do it on confrontations and I'm used to anime being like that. Overall sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well this is where it gets disappointing for me. There were a lot of character archetypes for one thing and even though they gave almost everyone a back-story I still wound up only caring for only four people by the end of the anime. \\n\r\nAnd now for the controversial opinion: I really hated Makanshoku Matoi, Not only was it really obvious that she was going to be comic relief but she was there interrupting scene upon scene with her fast paced solo monologues. It was okay the first couple times but they kept pushing that all the way to the end of the whole season, often times breaking the mood and making fourth wall jokes.\\n\r\nAs for our villains: One was a always happy/rage filled cute woman and the other was egotistical/I know the secrets of the universe bitch. The first one was fun but the second one was like an average villain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a really enjoyable anime to watch, animation top notch, story is good, characters are descent, and just a really fun ride. Now stay tuned for my spoiler section.\\n\\n\r\n****Spoilers****\\n\\n\r\nI just want to talk about the ending in this section because it left me on a bad note. The ending felt really rushed in my opinion. Its as if they really had no more time left and just threw it all together. It went from the current battle of the last episode to Nui just being absorbed by Mother to Ryuuku becoming like a super saiyin and fighting in space. They should've just made another episode to finish up the season nicely and of course they did hint this second season because of what that mother said about clothes invading earth in the near future.",

It had some funny moments but overall the comedy didn\u2019t appeal to me and it felt awkward when against the serious, violent themes of the anime. Like a series about an oppressive ruler and class inequality and you\u2019re gonna have boobie and panty gags every episode? Okay. And for 8 episodes it felt like all of the supporting characters were severely underdeveloped - I feel like at that point the series should have had more character history for Ryuko and it really neededsome strong side characters. Mako was a fun character but a little too over the top and didn\u2019t mesh with Ryuko, I felt. I realize she was supposed to provide contrast but it just felt out of place.\\n\r\nBut I think what bothered me most was the gross sexualization of Ryuko. While it didn\u2019t completely take away from what little character development she had, I just can\u2019t be down with a series that has grown men ogling a teenage girl for gags in literally every single episode. \\n\r\nSo yeah. Not what I was expecting, and I really wanted to like it because Ryuko\u2019s kamui/uniform when it\u2019s not activated is fucking badass and sexy as hell. But alas.",

Every attempt to make the viewer feel a certain emotion was a complete success in my opinion, a very exiting anime to watch for sure.\r\nART: \r\nAt first I absolutely hated the art style, and that bothered me for a pretty long time when watching it thinking \"ugh this is so hideous\" but as the show got more interesting, the style really grewon me and I began to appreciate it a lot more. The style most certainly isn't everyone's piece of cake (I know people who couldn't stand the art style so they dropped it)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/MUSIC:\\n\r\nDONT LOSE YOUR WAYYYYYYY IN YOUR MIND WE HAVE TO BE AS ONE \\n\r\nDONT BE AFRAAAAIIIDD MY SWEETHEART THIS IS THE WAY TO BE MORE STRONG\\n\r\n  thats all I have to say about that subject.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe character's stories are VERY well told in my opinion, the villains are villain like, the heroes are heroic so on and so forth....\\n\r\nBut IN MY OPINION  Mako is really annoying for the first half of the show, and she kind of dosent fit very well in the show, however I DO understand why she's there, for comic relief and also who better to be Ryuuko's BFF  than a childish optimistic ... thing..\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of KLK \\n\r\nit was freaking epic, and brought out emotions in myself I didn't even know existed, it caused me to literally scream in the middle of class while I was watching an episode during free time (what a REBEL!!)  \\n\r\nIt made me cry really hard at points, and feel empowered and all together pleased after each episode (after I really got into the series)\\n\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\r\nWould Bang *cough *cough  I mean...

            "content": "Well, what an odd piece of anime we got us there, Trigger. What an odd anime indeed. \r\nFirst and foremost, I have to say, this was probably some of the most fun I had watching an anime. This show will not challenge you with deep meaning or cerebral commentary (not until you really want it to) but for me it was a jolly good time all around. But the anime itself, you have to know, oddly did not have a huge role in that. \r\nThe plot of the first few episodes moved along rather quickly and had a nice pace to it. Animation in thosefew episodes was also quite impressive and had an interesting style to it, I liked very much. Some gems like episode 4 were particularly impressive and so back then, the hype train was set in motion. And this here, is what I am talking about. The fandom surrounding Kill la Kill, even while vastly depleting now, back then was simply a blast and so much fun to me, while watching the show. \\n\r\nThe story itself, at first, was a nice spin on the traditional high-school setting and was used fairly cleverly to kick of usage of rather old tropes, that were used in new and interesting ways. That was helped by archetypical but very likeable characters, like Satsuki and the devas. They were practically mines of endless meme potential and funny in-jokes, making the show even more fun to watch. Like, you just have to look at Nonon for example and see the hours of fun, people had with her on facebook and other social media sites. But therein lies a huge problem in reviewing and watching this show today.\\n\r\nThat hypetrain has pretty much stopped and it was awesome while it lasted, but all good things have to come to an end. So, with what does it leave us with?\\n\\n\r\nI'd say, it leaves us with a rather enjoyable show, that would have greatly benefited form being cut in half. What was it? 25 episodes or so. Those are far to much time you have to spend with Kill la Kill and the show knows this as much as you do. The second half of the show was substantially weaker that the first half, even going so far as letting me assume, at some point they just made stuff up, as the went along. The plot with Ryuuko and her wanting to abandon Senketsu was pretty unnecessary, the school trip arc was just mind bogglingly stupid and many other small things here and there really put salt in my tea, there didn't need to be. Overall the second half, excepting a few things and the ending episode, was just far weaker than the opening episodes and hit my overall score quite a bit. On the other hand the show tackled some rather sensitive subjects like molesting and stuff and I am still not quite sure, what to think of it. I may be of the opinion, that you can satirize and make fun of everything, but something, simply leaving a bad taste in your mouth can quickly happen. The story as a whole about clothing and how it affects humans is interesting in its premise but left many things to be desired in execution and to be further elaborated.\\n\r\nOne minor detail though, whoever thought of the final form of Senketsu being called \u201cFashion Week\u201d is literally a genius in my eyes. I don't even know myself, I just find that to be the perfect name for the final form. \\n\r\nCharacters were overall quite memorable, like I said. I felt like, they were all justified to be there and no one, except Sanageyama of course. It is the blind one. I even had to look up his name for gods sake. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score was top notch and strong all around. Some character pieces like Nui's theme for example have become some of my favorites and the show spawned a few iconic phrases (Don't you lose that way baby, don't you ever lose it.) So almost no complaints on that front. Maybe some overusage, but never something to severe. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation this show feels interesting in the beginning, but outright disappoints in the middle and the end. As a growing studio, you have to know how to spread your budget wisely and not just waste it on a few pretty episodes to let the rest look mediocre to outright unpretty. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there are quite a few things pissing in my  Kill la Kill salad, but also many things I really liked about the show. I would rather think of it as a phenomenon, without really needing to be widely successful or in everybody\u2019s mouth. Something you had to have experienced while it was airing to get the full package. I know, that excludes a lot of people, but that unfortunately is how it is. Without that, it is slightly above average with many problems but also some things to like in return.",

The character development was spot on, and it was just so enjoyable to watch every episode. I'm very happy that it got to run 24 episodes rather than just 12. Aniplex/Trigger allowed closure, as well as allow the series to develop to its full potential. (Though I'm sure there are some who don'tagree) Oh and lets not forget the fanservice there if thats your thing.  I would recommend it to anyone, and the only thing stopping me from watching it again is knowing it will probably be dubbed shortly.",

            "content": "As of recent, I\u2019ve been sifting through my Netflix list of anime, and came across this. After hearing much about it and glimpsing some well-cosplayed characters at conventions, I gave Kill la Kill a shot. It definitely had the spice of \u201cnot what I was expecting\u2026\u201d\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nKill la Kill was something that I plowed through kind of quick. That really only happens when I sincerely enjoy a story. I think there were a lot of turns in the plot, and certain aspects kept the suspense going, thus, keeping you watching. One thing I highly enjoyed about Kill la Kill was that there were next tono \u201cfillers.\u201d Even though the plot was moving quickly, there was something happening EVERY episode that was linked to Ryuko\u2019s struggle. I didn\u2019t give the story aspect a perfect score because some people might think that some of the themes of some episodes might not need a WHOLE episode dedicated to them, and consider them filler. While I don\u2019t consider them filler, I do agree that some plot points didn\u2019t need to take up a whole 25 minute episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is supposed to be a vibrantly colored, fast, wacky anime. And believe me, it delivers. However, for as vibrant as it is, in some parts, the colors looked dulled, or off, from what they were for most of the anime. Some bits where everyone was moving fast, things looked very quickly drawn, and some lines didn\u2019t connect, and it looked awkward. My last gripe is the simple character design; the Goku uniforms didn\u2019t look like anything spectacular, and sometimes the background was more detailed than the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, aside from the moments where the color dulled, the colors were done very well. The Goku uniforms that transformed were creative {including the Kamui\u2019s}, the environments were done well, and the creative censorship was amusing. One could still tell what things were supposed to be {which is a basic plus}, and all of the girls still came across as sexy without much detail being drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese voices in Kill la Kill were cast PERFECTLY. The different tones matched the characters and their personality flawlessly. The English version did a good job of matching those voices as well, however, I feel as if whatever company re-worked the dub and scripted it, didn\u2019t even attempt to lip sync. I know with anime evolving and getting better, syncing becomes increasingly difficult for dubs, but this one is just so painfully obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI always enjoy a nice, soulful instrumental soundtrack. A lot of Kill la Kill\u2019s background music had lyrics to it. Which I wasn\u2019t too keen on, but it\u2019s upbeat and fitting nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters scored perfect because, even though some of them were stock characters, they certainly had quirks about them and went through such development that they make you care for them. At the end of the anime, I wanted it to continue because I wanted to know more about these characters and what they would do. Every little bit of them \u2013 even the rivalries \u2013 worked well with each other. The characters are the essence of Kill la Kill, they make the story entertaining and heartwarming at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.75/10\\n\\n\r\nKill la Kill is very entertaining with some interesting characters and concepts. With all the school uniforms being thrown around, one would think this is a school anime \u2013 and in a sense it is. But this is definitely no Azumanga Daioh. Get ready to laugh\\n\\n\r\nWarning: Kill la Kill is not for those who don't enjoy eechi, crude humor, or can\u2019t see the satire in anything.\\n\\n\r\nMelodux\u2019s Musings: I always vice-versa recommend Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking when talking about either/or. If you like one, you\u2019ll definitely like the other. They\u2019re very similar in the humor {PSG being more vulgar, I think}, have cartoon-like styles, and are equally insane. I, personally, live for anime like this, so Kill la Kill quickly became one of my favorites. I also love how Kill la Kill condensed a plot that normally should have taken longer than a full season {50+ episodes, think FullMetal Alchemist or the Dragon Ball franchise} into 26. I think that\u2019s genius satire in itself.",

In my opinion the anime drifted away from the main story line at times, but stayed on track throughout most of it. \r\nI can't say that I'd so much watch it again, but it was a fun anime especially towards the end.

The amount of plot armor throughout the entire series. How in almost every fight the main character got destroyed throughout most of the fight then won the fight in one attack, but not in a way like it did in One Punch Man. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime I would suggest people checkout. :)",

            "content": "Starting out goofy but action-packed, advancing as a wild, plot twist riddled, intense ride, and finishing relatively satisfyingly; Kill la Kill will be remembered as immensely entertaining for some, and a jumbled mess of \"bad\" animation and plot holes by the ones who take everything way too seriously.\r\nTrue, Kill la Kill is best enjoyed if you turn your mind off.  This is not to imply it is a mindless show, but that it's more enjoyable if you laugh instead of gripe at all the plot holes, \"fanservice,\" and over-the-top-ness that make up Kill la Kill.\r\nI had a blast watching it both alone and withfriends who don't mind if most of the characters bare most of their bodies most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music (for the first half of the show, at least) integrates itself extremely well into the mood of each scene, not only complimenting the tone of the show but amplifying it.  However, in later episodes, the show tries to switch from futuristic synthesizers to heavy guitar riffs and it doesn't really match.  This happens minimally, but it IS noticeable, and detracted from my enjoyment of the show, even if only slightly.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction is unique.  I don't really have much more to say other than the only time the animation is \"bad\" is when it's supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing special, but my god are there a lot of twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are solid.  By that I mean that they aren't all over the place, and that it wouldn't make sense for another character to do the things that they would do.  The characters aren't compelling or anything like that, but they are relatively consistent.  I'm sure that if you tried, you'd be able to pick apart my argument, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll fondly remember Kill la Kill as a lot of fun, action, plot twists, and jiggly bits.  While it's not the BEST anime out there, it's worth checking out.  It has is tense, serious moments, and it has its goofy, lighthearted ones.  But through what Kill la Kill is and isn't, I'll remember it as a classic.",

            "content": "An anime with two strong female individuals as the protagonists?! I must be dreaming, right? Nope. Just Kill la Kill saving anime. Studio Trigger must have thrown everything they did well with Gurren Lagann in a blender, added deep feminist undertones and flashy outfits, and created Kill la Kill. I'm still in conflict with myself over whether or not the \"fan service\" can really be considered \"fan service\". The story started out decent, but I felt like the first 14 episodes were more suitbale for an anime that spanned over more than the usual 20-25 episode anime. However, a HUGE plot twist- (one that Ipersonally didn't see coming whatsoever) -moved the story along to the climax extremely quickly. It was like BOOM. However, the sudden change in plot felt a bit rushed, which felt weird, judging by how it was a PLOT TWIST, something that usually should come unexpectedly. The series nonstop action met my standards, and left me twirling scissors around my finger in art class quite a bit. The transformation scenes were enjoyable most of the time, but felt a bit repetitive further into the show. The music and soundtrack was freaking AMAZING. My heart beat fast to the pace of another amazing score and soundtrack by Hiroyuki Sawano. The \"Elite Four\" supporting characters added a nice touch to Satsuki's seemingly bland character. The show did a nice job portraying the backstory of each Elite Four member, however, I felt that Nonon was left with the least background story compared to the other three. Ryuuko is by far my favorite anime character to date, as she showed that the girls in anime aren't just there to maintain the male protagonist's sense of sexuality. Also, I enjoyed the connection between Junketsu and Ryuuko. Overall, I give Kill la Kill a 9 out of 10. \\n\r\nAs a side note, I strongly recomend the subbed version, as the dub is just awful in my opinion.",

(As I mentioned before, WTF?!)\\n\\n\r\nKLK is something else entirely\\n\\n\r\nOk, so let\u2019s make an average of my scores,\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is superb! The animation is well\u2026.different, one must watch it to see what I mean, because it can\u2019t well be described in words the main factor that made me think this show and its creators are high. It is a mix of fluid animation, not so fluid animation, comic scenes, good fights all meshed in together in a coherent fashion, the animation is much more\u2026.err\u2026.cartoon-ish, which by no means is bad. I\u2019m kinda running out of words here to describe the animation, but know it is good in its own unique way and in all pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the shows strong points, the characters are really well-done, from the lovable idiot Mankanshoku and her comic family, to the overly serious President Satsuki, her elite four squadron, and of course the main character, Ryuuko Matoi. They all have decent back-story, and JUST enough to really make you like, empathize or feel at ease with them. I won\u2019t divulge further into the characters, as the characters and their relations and developments are one of the primary settings to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty ordinary, a girl seeking revenge for her father\u2019s death so she goes to a school which may have answers the mystery. However the way the animation, characters and in some cases dialogues are nicely wrapped around this story is what makes it unique in its own terms. There is not much here I can say about the story.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue isn't really that impressive. No thought-provoking, goosebumps inducing, high dialogues, just the regular things a show would use for dialogues, though there are different ways of how clothes can be looked at are presented.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating as a whole on it would be - 7.75, rounded to an 8.0, \\n\\n\r\nKLK presents obviously un-serious things in the most serious and cocksure way possible and I have thoroughly enjoyed what Trigger has offered.",

The first time i watched ep 1 of kill la kill when it was aired, i don't really like it. I decided to drop it. After sometimes, when it was finished airing, the score shocked my mind. Yes, 8.5. Anime which I thought was ridiculous has scrored so high. I decided to watch it again and finally I finished it. And here's my opinion:\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story is actually a simple one. It has 2 main points, revenge and stop the world domination..by clothes, yeah right. Well maybe i think it's odd about clothes and stuff but maybe it has its own uniqueness, oh well. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nEventhough the art seems dull and low budgetted, it is actually unique. It reminds me of Gurren Lagann. It has a strong emotion in it eventhough it's not smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nBGM was amazing, especially when the battle reach its climax. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nWhen some characters are great and have their own points of interest, I found some characters are too ridiculous and annoying. You wouldn't joke when it comes to final battle, would you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nEveryone has their own taste, and I don't really like too much comedy or parody like Kill la Kill. I prefer more serious anime. Because of that I couldn'treally enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) \\n\r\nWell, everyone has their opinion, and I don't really like Kill la Kill. Actually I was about to give it 6, but I think it over again and give it 7. I don't want to just give it 6 subjectively, and I want to mark this anime objectively from every aspect. Still, in my opinion, it's overhyped. Well, maybe Kill la kill doesn't suit me, that's all. But it maybe is a great anime for the one who likes comedy, parody, and heavy battle.",

            "content": "Having hear of all the hype surrounding it, I was cautious going into KLK. Rarely is something as good or bad as the rumors say.\r\nTo summarize my impressions - it's overhyped. I've seen worse, but I've seen better too.\r\nIt has elements from Saint Seiya (cloths), TTGL (over-the-top everything), FLCL and a few other anime.\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, the music is fine but nothing to wrote home about. Honestly I can't remember a single melody from the score right now. Art/animation is...really bad and choppy. The line tracing often looks like it was done by a 5-year old, with oddly distorted arms, hands and faces, andthe number of frames in an the animation is often really low. The show tries to hide it with fast-paced action and designs that split your attention, but cannot really accomplish that.\\n\r\nWeather that art/animation styles is because of budget problems or a deliberate \"artistic\" decision, I do not know, but it changes little. A turd put on a piece of paper and displayed in a museum as art still stinks the same as any other.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is fast-paced and full of action, but convoluted with many things happening for convenience, \"just because\" and things thrown in because of \"rule of cool\". No explanation is often given and the show breaks it's own established rules whenever it feels like it. (for example, 1-star uniform wearers can't even hurt 3-star uniform ones. Our main protagonist has a 10-star equivalent uniform, and yet still gets hurt by 3-star uniforms)\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is... hit and miss. Given that I like shows like Excel Saga, Nichijou and Cromartie High, I expected to love this...but...The main comic relief character, Mako, is IMHO one of the worst such characters I've ever seen. The only guy who had me laughing is mr. Nudist Beach. \\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is off the charts, and the general \"message\" seems to be to accept nudity (most obvious in the unlocking of the uniforms full power)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...again it seems like the show is trying too damn hard, most obvious with the \"antagonist\" Satsuki, whom they pull every single cliche to try and make her \"badass\". Obvious example includes beating people with her \"spirit\" as a kid (even tough such power has never been mentioned before or after), brooding and similar. Not to mention her actions seem very irrational at times (such as refusing to tell Ryuko anything, and prompting everyone to fight her, despite knowing that she has a superior uniform AND a weapon designed to destroy them - meaning that no one logically stands a chance)\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of it's flaws, it is still a fun romp and manages to be entertaining enough.\\n\r\nDo take note that 6 is NOT a bad rating (since it puts the show in the \"above average\" category), especially since I do not give out high scores lightly.",

            "content": "I never thought I would do one of these, but I felt like Kill la Kill gave me so little to work with that I feel like I need to do one of those short \"category\" reviews. And, for those that have read my past reviews, you know it's pretty shocking to see me give something as widespreadily loved as Kill la Kill a low score of all things, but this is just the way I see it.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nSingle-handedly my favorite part about Kill la Kill is its story. I thought the whole Life Fiber thing had a LOT of potential and it was gettingpretty good well before the finale portion, but by the actual finale, I felt disappointed. This is, once again, one of those cases where the buildup is better than the actual finale.\\n\\n\r\nI can call it similar to Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple where I enjoyed the fight between Berzerk and Hermit much more than the real one that the show thought you wanted to see, because that fight used an incredible musical score and it actually looked like a real fight.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite obvious here, but the art lacks in detail unlike most Sh\u014dnen anime that normally aim for good art quality. That being said, its lack of detail left room for it to look very animated and the fight scenes are surprisingly not forced at all, in that nothing looks stretched, deformed or anything of the sorts. I feel as though they intentionally made it this way so that they could draw it out better and it worked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI am only giving this a high score because I LOVED that techno beat that played during the finale when Uzu was trying to break open that lipstick looking metal thing and it played a few times during Ryuko's own fights. Still looking for the full version of that song because it is so cool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI am, again, rating this on a single asset: Mako. Too damn good that she is never pessimistic the entire time, though I was extremely confused when she made the Fight Club because when her family went back to the slumps, WHY did they not go back to One Star living? When they were in that apartment, they looked fine, but I guess they had to do the generic \"home is where the heart is\" bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI am mixed about this because I did enjoy it, but I did not enjoy it at the same time. So, I just put an in-between thing here. It was good, but it got pretty stale towards the ending and I enjoyed it more during the first half than I did the second.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The website already shows this score.\\n\\n\r\nThough the plot twists were VERY good, such as Ryuko's dad, real mom and so on being the most major twists in the entire anime, the story itself felt extremely stale towards the end and I wish it delivered more than what it did. That being said, I thought the whole concept was VERY original, though it wasn't fleshed out as much as it could have been; once again turning into another case of \"the villain looked OP, but then she lost\" and they all won, happy happy fun time and so on.\\n\\n\r\nThis could be a bit bias in that I usually enjoy Slice of Life and comedies more anyway, but I have watched Sh\u014dnen that were really good before, so I think this review is not tainted just because the genre is not my favorite or most watched. I just feel that Kill la Kill is one of those cases where everyone says it's good because it's their first time watching Sh\u014dnen. But, that being said, there ARE rare exceptions here and there.",

            "content": "When I initially heard of this show, I thought it was worthless. I couldn't be more wrong in my entire life. Kill la Kill is pure fun all the way through, though it's not for everyone, it is one of my favorite shows in quite a while. \r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story is absolutely stupid, and I love it for that. Satsuki Kiryuin rules Honnouji Academy, a high school in japan. Everything is going fine(or, as fine as it usually is), until a transfer student named Ryuko Matoi appears, claiming that Satsuki killed her father with the other half of the giant scissors Ryuko has in her possession.SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST EPISODE START HERE, IF YOU WANT TO GO IN CLEAN, READ WHERE THEY STOP: After finding herself too weak to beat the weakest student on the food chain, Ryuko goes back home, where she finds, inside her basement, a talking sailor uniform, which forces her to wear him, and she goes back to the academy, kicks the student's ass, wearing some of the most skimpy clothing I've seen.EPISODE ONE SPOILERS END HERE, YOU CAN READ HERE:Now, Ryuko must work her way through all the school clubs, up to Satsuki's personal lackeys, and confront Satsuki herself.  Sounds stupid, right? It's outstandingly stupid, and that's just the first episode. It gets a lot crazier from here, so if you like crazy, nonsensical plots, this one's got you covered.\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art style of KLK is quite nice. I'm not one to enjoy overly sketchy art styles, but for whatever reason, this one does it for me. Also, at least in my opinion, KLK is the definition of  No Money =/= Horrible Animation. The animation studio, Trigger, didn't have a big budget at all, and they knew this going in, so they heavily stylized the show, and it works very well. It isn't fluid most of the time, and uses digital manipulation to move the characters around in a comedic manner, and it works. For fight scenes, the show gets very fluid.\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of KLK is amazing, but aside from a few examples, they are only amazing in the moment of the show. Some songs that are great any time are the 2 openings, the 2 endings, the now  iconic and tied to the show for eternity \"Before My Blood Dries\", better known by fans as \"Don't Lose Your Way\", and \"Bulmakratz\"(I think I spelled that correctly), a song that appears in the latter half of the show. All the other tunes are great when the show is going, but I couldn't get them into my head, but the examples I showed are always in my head, therefore, It moves up to a 10 for me.\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nI'll only be covering the 3 main characters, as I feel all other characters are better if you discover them on your own. Our main character, Ryuko, is extremely likable. A lot of the humor from the first few episodes comes from here experiencing the insane world around her with the rationality of a normal person. Her main mission is to avenge her father, but as the series goes, she grows as a character. Satsuki, on the other hand, isn't as easy to analyze. I won't say anything else, but she is one of the best developed characters on the show. Our final character is Mankanshoku Mako, possibly the best character on the show. She is basically the internet if you put it into a schoolgirl uniform. She's the best \"funny\" character in my opinion, and she even does stuff, unlike a lot of comic-relief characters. She's half of the shows humor, with the other half being sex-based, which speaking of that...\\n\r\nFANSERVICE:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, fanservice is like QTEs in video games: There's an right way to do it, and a bad way to do it. Most go for the bad way, because it's the easiest, and doesn't require explanation, just shove in a boob shot and done. The good way to do fanservice to have a reason for it to be happening. It has to be explained through the plot. The best example I can think of is in the early chapters of Dragon Ball, where Bulma flashes Kame-senin without knowing, because Goku had removed her panties the night before, because he didn't understand that women don't have the parts men have, because he's an idiot. For the most part, Kill La Kill does fanservice the right way, though certain episodes (16,19, and 21, specifically) have scenes made to shock the audience, and that it does. \\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nKill La Kill will not be for everyone. The fanservice will keep some fans away, and it's story isn't deep nor does it ask questions, but that's not what it's trying to do. Kill la Kill is trying to be a fun, stupid action-fest, and on that regard, it succeeds beautifully. The show is worth a watch, and I, for one, cannot wait for the OVA in september.\\n",

            "content": "Kill la Kill marks Trigger's return as a good anime studio, with over the top action and comedy with a few minor problems.\r\nActual Score: 8.6\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story focuses around Ryuuko Matoi revenge story as she attempts to find her father's killer which just further escalates as the story progresses but can be spilt into to three distinctive parts the first focusing on the revenge story which is a wild ride and a lot of fun to watch focusing on Ryuuko battling many club leaders; oh yeah by the way this is set in a HighSchool run like a dictator ship by the merciless student councilpresident Satsuki and her elite four, but back on topic the middle arc is by far the worst disappointing bit as it is boring and only provides bits of comedy and drama that are note worthy good and finally the final part is just awesome and I won't say anymore because that would be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art is the shows weakest part as it can go from looking amazing with well done battles that have an over the top feeling that Kill la Kill wants as well as stylish art that feels fresh and unique but can also feel a bit of for people not used to it but trust if it looked different it wouldn't be the same; now on to the bad points as Trigger really felt they spent most of their money on the fight scenes as some of animation can come as quite poor in other scenes as well as these stand still like scenes that appear before a epic fight and then will cut after the fight that ruins the moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing with well orchestrated pieces for various villains and other characters that make each encounter feel unique and will hype you up for character on screen as well as \"Don't Lose your way\" that plays during most of Ryuuko's fight scenes making them feel more amazing as you watch them as well as it feeling like it's speaking to Ryuuko telling her not to lose her way during the fights; breaking the fourth wall there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique and different in both appearances and personality but there to many to go over as there is a long cast so ill just go over a few characters; firstly there is Ryuuko the fiery hot headed protagonist who will fight all just to find out her father's killer and goes thought some good character development; next is Mako the side chick comic relief character but is actually genially funny and does serve as critical part of plot and Ryuuko's development and Satsuki the Student council president and dictator of the school who has a cold and calm personality but develops into something more over the course of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI loved this show and would recommend it do any anyone who loves over the top action, comedy and doesn't mind a plot you don't take seriously. Warning: Theirs a lot of fan service and ecchi scenes; you have been warned.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine putting 50 ADD guys in a room and telling them to write a story with awesome action sequences, big boobs, and memorable character. Would it be enjoyable? Yes. Funny? Yes. Waaaaay over the top and all over the place? Most definitely. I'm pretty sure that that was actually how Kill la Kill was produced, and it truly worked. The action sequences are intense and awesome with the main character, Ryuko Matoi kicking people's butts with little to no clothing on. In fact the show makes it point to show EVERYONES boobs in EVERY episode. At first this was hilarious and made for some funnypedophile jokes, but it grows stale real fast. In fact the whole show grew kind of stale to me. The show starts with every episode having a challenge for Ryuko and her friend, Mako involving beating a club captain at her school. These episodes were enjoyable as they were carefree yet still had over the top action with good humor and a lot of fan service. However, the second half of the show is where the plot gets incredibly weird. For fear of producing spoilers, I will just say, clothes as supreme overlords. This is something you'd expect from Jimmy Neutron, not a teen anime. However, none of this show should be taken seriously so I let it slide and the episodes were still enjoyable and the action was even better. It comes down to this: the first half is funnier, and the second half has more action. Now to the characters. There is zero character development, but that is okay for anime with a wild plot. All of the characters are memorable, and they all have their funny quirks. The soundtrack is excellent and the artwork is decent. The action is fluid even though the character's faces and art style took me a while to get used to. Every once in awhile the art quality would drop, but it was never for an extended period of time. This anime gets a 7 for being funny, over the top and enjoyable yet at the same time a little TOO weird and TOO over the top. However, if you are into fanservice and crazy plots, this should be at the top of your list.",

            "content": "I was just thoroughly entertained by this TRIGGER masterpiece. \r\nThere is much that can be said of this anime I will utterly fail trying to explain it. \r\nThat being said I attempt to do my best to persuade you that this is a piece of work that I strongly suggest you consider. \r\nFirst the story. Its awesome, sure it has some familiar aspects but that's what makes it perfect when added to its creative and absurd center. I mean one of the center themes is clothing/uniforms and even though that is not a completely new idea the way that KLK uses it, is. The directorHiroyuki Imsaishi and writer Kazuki Nakashima are awesome and hold up to their expectations. And one of the greatest things you can expect from these two is a lightning paced story that surprisingly will leave very few plot holes, if any to confuse you. No fillers or breaks no useless crap for these guys, just straight to the point. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. Now the art can be debated and in fact when I first glimpsed Kill La Kill I actually put it off for a little bit due to the art. Im someone who really cares about the artwork being detailed and fluid and nice so when I saw Kill La Kill's somewhat crude and rough texture I was a little turned off. That was a mistake on my part and definitely taught me the \"not to judge by appearances\" lesson. Kill La Kill's art like almost everything about it is what makes it unique and wonderful. It perfectly handles its characters through high octane action and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Personally I loved every single characters voice and thought each one perfectly fit its role. The music was awesome and had me humming it after watching some of the episodes. I always had the sound turned on high when watching Kill La Kill. It definitely adds to the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Kill La Kill has a huge amount of diversified characters and each one is unique and enjoyable. It has the tough, confident and cocky MC, The cool and powerful antagonist, the funny as hell freind, the crazy villain, even the sailor uniform becomes a memorable character and despite this diversity it puts time into each one, giving you a decent understanding of each one with little underdevelopment. Your bound to have a favorite character by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs I've said earlier, I was thoroughly entertained, this has definitely become one of my favorites and I will definitely be watching this again in the future. I was so devastated when I watched the last episode and knew I would then have to look for another anime that would probably not be on par with KLK. I highly recommend you give it a watch and if you enjoy it please rate it 10 not because it necessarily is a perfect anime but I mean come on it only has a 8.4 despite it being much better than a lot of the other anime's above it.",

I noticed a lot of people has been bashing this anime till now after watching like what, 3 episodes? You have to watch more! I was at tears by the end, besides all the nudity in the last episode I couldn't helpbut have my heart melt at the last few minutes of episode 4. Obviously the first few episodes were meh but doesn't all popular animes start off boring or weird in the beginning? I'm giving this a 10/10, I can't wait for the special unaired episode to come!",

            "content": "Ah, Kill la Kill. It's so dumb, yet so awesome at the same time; a show that makes you say, \"only in anime!\" I didn't enjoy it quite as much as others clearly did, but overall, I'm glad I watched it.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThis is one of those shows that isn't about the story. There's nothing wrong with the plot of this show, but it isn't the selling point. It starts as a girl in a wacky school, trying to find her father's killer and kicking the ass of the club presidents while wearing practically nothing, and then the final third turns it into a semi-apocolypticbattle for the survival of humanity - it's sort of epic. Again, the plot isn't the selling point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nKill la Kill has some amazing characters. The lead, Ryuuko Matoi, is so easy to root for, plus she's a badass, though not unbeatable by any means. Her best friend Mako Mankanshoku is a ball of pure energy and smiles, and I absolutely adore her. She's a real friend when she has to be, too. Satsuki Kiryuuin, the student counsil president and starting antagonist, as well as the \"elite four\", have some great hidden depth and development. They're more than just villains. Really, the whole cast is likeable: Mako's family, despite being poor, is happy and tight-knit, and treat Ryuuko like she was their own daughter (when they aren't trying to peek at her in the bath); the undercover teacher who constatly takes his shirt off; Ryuuko's talking sailor uniform Senketsu... I could go on. Despite everyone being quite fleshed-out and likeable, the villain is so easy to hate. I couldn't wait for her to die; she experiments on and molests her own daughters, that's how messed up she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Music - 9\\n\r\nKill la Kill looks great. I found the style very pleasing to the eye, and some of the direction is really great. The fanservice was more comedic than anything, and is just part of the charm in my opinion. Some of the budget restrictions created abslute hilarity. I really love the animation. As for the soundtrack, I love that too. \"Don't Lose Your Way!\" is a great victory song, and super catchy, but there are also some other notable tracks. Satsuki's theme, with its horns, is an absolutely perfect match. My personal standout is Blumenkranz, the theme for the aforementioned lead villain, and another perfect fit. As usual, I never stuck around for the endings, but both openings were great and super catchy; the second one standing out in particular. I really enjoyed the production values of this show.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 7\\n\r\nIt took me a bit to get fully on board with this show. Part of that has to do with the fact that I was watching the Fate series at the same time. I didn't think the show was a masterpiece, but it was fun. You really have to turn your brain off for this one. I remember that I watched an episode and then took a bath and was somewhat amused at how much skin is shown in the series. If you want a fun, dumb action show, you really can't go wrong with Kill la Kill.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nThis series definitely has its merits, but it's not perfect, just entertaining. But it's not without value, and certainly not insulting to your intelligence. If you haven't already, give this show a go. It'll pass the time.",
