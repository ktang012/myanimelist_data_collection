            "content": "Some of you may remember me from my repressed review of Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000% . But like a moth burnt by the flame, I never learn my lesson. I'm back, baby. \nUta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%  introduced us to some vapid and brightly coloured characters who quickly grew a place in our hearts like a shockingly virile parasitic worm. \nThere's, you know, \"her\" / \"thing\" / \"soup-eyes-chan\" / \"pink\" (or as some call her, \"Haruka\"), the girl who can't sing - sorry, I'm thinking of the rest of the cast - I mean, read music. And then there's the rest of thegigolos, \"hime-cut\", \"manwhore\", \"blue guy with irritating vibrato\", \"heart-defect-kun\", \"guy who voiced a prison guard in Enzai\", \"yatta\", etc. These, our beloved friends. They have returned to us. \\n\\n\nCecil is bored with being a cat and a grandmother and decides to enroll in Gigolo School with the rest of the cast. Unfortunately he brings with him a gaggle of other cast members. I would guess there was two dozen in all. It's difficult because they all came without their personalities. Don't forget your drinking games - drink when every new character is introduced and we'll end up colour-blind, hey girls?\\n\\n\nAlong with Cecil's janitor or whatever, there's the addition of a rival gang of senpai singers (presumably they were touring the world during the first season, or at least the countries that aren't anti-LGBT). Seems like these senpais finally noticed them. Well done boys. BTW, did you know the band's official name is STARISH? I thought it was Uta Pri. Not STAR, or STAR-like, just an 'ish'. Like, you know, they're not quite celestial orbs... more like glow in the dark watch faces. This is who we're rooting for. \\n\\n\nAs well as Senpais, STARISH (who knew, right?) are competing against HEBENSU for the Uta Pri Prize. Gee, with a name like that, I wonder who will win?\\n\\n\nOK, sit back, 'cos I know you've edged towards the very boundary of what constitutes a seat. Time for some spelunking in what little depth this series has. Don't worry, we won't need a snorkel. \\n\\n\n*Music*\\n\\n\nThe music this time round is much the same. Various themes used throughout were forgettable. We skipped the OP every time, it's an anal waxing of a song. The ED is a little better. Of course it's incorporated into the final episode (as always). It's bland, too many parts, and for a long time I thought it spelt out STARFISH, but no, it was STARISH. That is, until Cecil joined the band, who saw that coming? He obviously brought with him the 'F'.*\\n\\n\nP.S. Image songs were enough to drive me to violent crime. Blue guy's especially verges on animal abuse.\\n\\n\n*Animation*\\n\\n\nDepressingly high standard as usual. There's a lot less chibi this time round, obviously someone read my review.\\n\\n\nThe fight scene in one episode went shounen for a while, it was an amusing aside to take me away from my crushing despair over everything this anime stands for. \\n\\n\nLess inside mist than the first series. \\n\\n\nHaruka's fashion is a bit more toned down this time round, or maybe my retinas are just scorched.\\n\\n\n*Voice acting*\\n\\n\nMade me wish I was deaf.\\n\\n\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\nI didn't. \\n\\n\nSaotome is pretty much the saving grace of this series. Saotome is kind of Michael Jackson meets Goku. He talks in Engrish a lot and has a (sadly late) rivalry with someone called Raging who dresses like a pimp. I am shocked and saddened that we cannot date him. \\n\\n\nAll in all, 2000% no.",

I also like Nanami's seiyuu as well and Shinning Saotome's over exaggerated tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Good 7 , I believe you....I..\\n\\n\r\nOk, Nanami maybe the driving force of STARISH, but it was the guys who has the most contribution with this anime's feature, though I could have given this  part a 5, it was the introduction of Cecil Aijima that has added to the flair of the group. There is also the Sempais; Ranmaru Kurosaki,Ai Mikaze ,Reiji Kotobuki and Camus as well as the \"Heavens\", \u0112ichi \u014ctori , Nagi Mikado and Kira Sumeragi who seem to be just a bunch of pretty face that were added for additional antagonist of the protagonist, We're Heaven,  Yes We're Heavens.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Good 8 ,  I hold you...

            "content": "If you enjoyed Ulta no Prince sama 1, then you will also enjoy the second season. Sequels are notorious for not being up to par with it's origional series, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. This anime is lighthearted and just absolutely fun to watch. By no means is it going to be some sort of \"drama masterpiece\" if that's what you're looking for. The story had potential, but with the series only having 13 episodes it would be rather difficult to get too far into each of the main character's backgrounds. The comedy bits in this series kind of remind meof Ouran Highschool Host Club, and I actually found myself smiling and giggling in a few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nYou have your stereotypical shoujo anime male personality types ...the mysterious, the smart, the playboy, the feminine one, ect... however, in my opinion, the writers were able to execute each of their characters smoothly. The female lead can come off a little dry but she surprises you at certain moments throughout the episodes. Her personality is very cute and endearing. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all its a great show for a shoujo anime. The artwork is beautiful, the songs are fun, they characters make you laugh, and you find yourself cheering on for at least one of the guys to get the girl. My only complaint is there aren't enough episodes for the writers to have added a little more drama into the anime and spend more time on each character as an individual. Hope others enjoy watching this series as much as I did :) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: The anime will continue where it left off, following the steps of Haruka to become a famous composer, along with her friends Otoya, Masato, Natsuki, Tokiya, Ren, Syo and Cecil, whose dream is to become idols.\r\nHowever, it won\u2019t be easy for the boys as they\u2019ll have to pass a strict exam supervised by the idols Reiji, Ranmaru, Ai and Camus. For those who already watched the first episode then i bet most of you love it just like i do.. Ive been waiting for this season two to come out, im so excited to watch the ep. 1 and when it's been finally aired,those waiting days didnt disappointed me at all! It's worth it.. \\n\\n\r\nArt: just like the season one, Uta no Prince-sama 2000%'s art is good too but should i say it became better than the season one? There arent any changes at the characters' faces or whatsover but if you watch the season one first ep. And the season two first ep. You will see the difference on how it became better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: sound... Yeah sound! XD lets talk about it... The songs are sooo awesome! The opening, i like it very much especially the song which the quartet night sang when they introduced themselves! The voice, the so called wave when they sing are just so awesome! The song poison kiss is like a drug to me XD i became so addictive in that song even if the full version isnt out yet (im anticipating to it XD) their songs evolved to the next round ...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: as you all know, there are new characters like camus,ai,ranmaru and reiji. You can say that they are all bishies just like our fav. Characters ittoki,natsuki,syo, ichinose,masato,cecil and ren. If you like the cool type then go for ranmaru, for the girls who like ittoki then reiji is right for you :D.. And hmm... For ai (which is my fav chara from the group quartet night XD) if you know flan of katekyo hitman reborn, they are kinda look a like and ai looks like the silent type for me and lastly, if you like guys who are kinda cold then camus is the right for you xD....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: if you're a girl who squeals or who gets easily flustered when an anime guy does something sweet for the girl then you will find it here :D the seven main characters (boys) are all soo sweet to our fav. Composer nanami. The atmosphere is kinda funny too, so if you like kaichou wa maid-sama, special a and other animes which has a fluffy and sweet genre that will make you kyaaa then this anime suits you, so if you're that type just like me then watch this, i promise... You wont be disappointed at this anime coz it will give an enjoyment which you like :D..\\n\\n\r\nHope this is helpful for you...",

            "content": "Maji Love 2000% picks up the story where the first season left off. After making their - successful - debut, they are supposed to pick up the pace and become even more successful. They are to follow a special program while pursuing their careers. \r\nI did read all the reviews before me, the general consensus seems to be that it is as good as if not better than the first season. I do not share that opinion.\r\nIn my opinion:\r\nStory:  While the story wasn't brilliant - not that I expected it from this anime - the first season, there was indeed more plot. To startwith \"cataract\" Minami and her inability of reading sheet music, which was the leeway to her sickly childhood. \\n\r\nThere was the individual stories of every single one of the boys, from family member coldness of Jinguuji, to burnout of Hayato/Ichinose. Not only that but more importantly all those single stories got connected somehow to one fluid plot.\\n\r\nThe  second season does not have fluidity. There are single episodes that deal with the members of Starish but those do not really connect to each other. Then final/highpoint arc is introduced, Heavens vs Starish, and ... no, except for my  suspension point there is really no build up in the story towards the end. The competition is announced in episode 11 cataract-girl struggles in episode 12 and bum you have the - obvious and over the top - resolution in 13.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Except for cataract girl I really have no complaints. One could say I actually watched it for the art, as in bishounen. And yes, they are so, so, so, so very beautiful! If I could scoop out the eyes of Minami I would be ecstatic. But all things said and done, the beauty of the boys and the landscape (seriously, the schools in both seasons are like castles and the greenery and the lake, ..., I really wanna be there too!) numbs my brains and I forget about her creepy eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the music in the first season so much better. In my opinion compared to first season the sound of second season is pathetic. I have heard more entertaining and effective jingles than the songs of the second season. And if that is not enough they are pale imitations of the first season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Maji Love 2000% is trying to compensate for the lack of plot via introducing a bunch of new bishounen. While visually considered I have no earthly complaints, I have to say, the season ended and none of those characters really helped the plot in any significant or insignificant way. They were just very pretty to look at.  When they were first introduced as the sempais to help Starish members to become more \"idol\"y I expected for them to do something. Anything. Guide, or help at a crossroads of life or something. At the end, they were there. And they were pretty. Then there were the 3 members of Heavens. The evil act was just so funny that I have no complaints. Albeit, I am guessing it wasn't meant to be funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy it. Because let's be honest, if you are going to watch this kind of anime, you do not have or you should not have high expectations regarding the plot. So I took it on the face value and I did enjoy myself watching all the bishounen and making fun of cataract Minami and laughing at the antics of Saotome. I was sorry to see less of Hyuga Sensei and Ringochan and Tomochan but it is understandable with only 13 episodes you cannot thin out the plot more than its already watery self. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you are in the mood something light and soul uplifting; with a plot that won't engage your brain in the least, curb your expectation and watch this. It is an anime with a lot of bishounen and beautiful landscape and acceptable sound.",

I can't tell you. As someone who truly, with a burning passion, did not like the anime, I'm surprised I even made it  to the second season. There's just something strange and creepy about this anime that made me feel such intense emotion, and the urge to complete it.\r\nI may have liked this season more than the first, but the plot it still so, so shitty. Whoever came up with the plot forthis second season...I'd like to think that they don't  exist. That being said, I came into the first season with little expectations. If I was to put my expectations into a numerical form, they would be at about 0.001. So I actually am proud to say that this anime exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice and vibrant, but seeing as I really don't like bishies, or Nanami's creepy ass eyes for that matter, I had to rate it an 8. I probably would have rated this a 1 if the art was really bad.\\n\\n\r\nCecil and the DPD guy were the only memorable boys in the smorgasbord of men. Seriously, how many of them were there?\\n\\n\r\nI will never forget this anime. My taste in anime has gotten better over the (months) but my hatred of UtaPri only intensifies. I want to be a little la on this anime, seeing as it was a game, but I just can't. Even La Corda D'Oro was better than this, and that's a game as well.\\n\\n",

It surely is an outstanding anime, but not in a good way.\r\nThe art is better than in the first season and the characters have more interactions with both Haruka and themselves, they don't exist as background to the main romance anymore. \r\nThe story made at least a bit of sense this time, actually. The main plot, at least. No shapeshifting cats this time around.\r\nThe music is badand the choreography is even worse, but put it together and you'll have the time of your life, honestly.

The show is funny, cute and brings great music to enjoy all the way through to the end! The only problem I have with it is that the female lead doesn't seem to understand a single thing that is going on.. A little more involvement from her side would be great in my opinion. But I guess making her a plain jane is sort of the point to make us all feellike WE are actually part of this hot story! I mean, lets not forget this is all based on a visual novel of love.  \\n\r\nIn terms of if this is worth watching or not.. YES. This season honestly picks it up a notch from last time, so if you even remotely enjoyed season 1, i suggest you make the effort to see past the somewhat poor story development here and enjoy the guys at their best! \"doki doki\"\\n",

            "content": "- Haruka, what's so great about Starish? \r\n- They sparkle, and that makes me want to watch them forever.\r\nAlthough it may sound silly as an inspirational quote, the reality is that it sums up this anime pretty well. While you may not find great life lessons or cultural facts to be learned from this show, you'll definitely find some sparkle in it (lots of it, in fact), so if that's your thing, then Uta no Prince-sama 2 is definitely for you.\r\nHaving gone from being 1000% about \"real love\" to being 2000% about it, things definitely get more intense. From the extra sparkle to theexcessive and awkward use of Engrish (in both songs and dialogues), the protagonist's eyes have become even creepier, the school even prettier, the lines even cheesier and the guys even more flamboyant. Besides all these \"intensifications\", new guys also join the picture and range from \"professionals\" to wannabes (along with the odd prince). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you've seen the first season, then you probably know that, no matter how many boys join the cast, Shining Saotome will always be the man. Seriously, he's still the best thing about this show and probably will continue to be for all the seasons to come.\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than write an essay about all the redeeming qualities of this wonderful character, I will instead point out some of the strengths and weaknesses this second season had so that you may decide whether you actually want to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the overall look and style of this show as well as the art and animation, then I have good news for you. These have definitely improved and the characters no longer look like they're convulsing during the dance sequences. This doesn't save them from continuing to look completely ridiculous, but hey, that applies to more than one aspect of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough no girl is silly enough to believe that they can be surrounded by almost a dozen males all fighting for her attention, UtaPri 2 takes the \"unbelievable\" to  the next level. From adding princes mentioned above to settings and outfits that are even more lavish and extravagant than those in the first season, this show loses what little credibility it had beforehand. While I have seen my fair share of schools that are simply too pretty to be real in shows like Ouran Koukou Host Club, Vampire Knight, and Diabolik Lovers (notice how only reverse harems take place in fancy schools?), the academy in UtaPri 2 is on another level altogether. As if that wasn't enough, the protagonists also engage in spontaneous tea drinking in the foyer and have thousands of roses delivered to their love interest's dorm room, because, hey, isn't that what all high schoolers and college students do?\\n\\n\r\nEvery single time when I thought that this anime couldn't get any more ridiculous, it always managed to prove me wrong. This inevitably made it pretty addicting, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. In many ways, UtaPri 2 is \"so bad it's good\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom an opening that sounds like it's trying way too hard to be cool and edgy to an ending that pretty much sounds exactly the same as the one used in the first season, the songs are just as bubbly and forgettable as all the ones used before. Additionally, the main characters now all come with their own songs too, which sound... Cringeworthy. Although some of  the songs were okay (and I know that they were performed by experienced seiyuu who underwent rigorous singing training), most of these character songs sounded outright bad and again made this show almost too embarrassing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime, however, is the Engrish. Although I know that actual JPOP songs throw in some Engrish about 90% of the time, UtaPri 2 songs not  only use it 100% of the time, but also happen to do it pretty terribly. From phrases like \"believe heart\" and \"release sing\" to \"let's peace\", \"let's song\", and, my personal favorite \u2014 \"we love song\", the use of terrible grammar is just another aspect which makes this anime unintentionally hilarious. I mean, would it really have killed them to hire an English language consultant? While I understand that a lot of the budget for this anime must have gone to fancy special effects, artists, animators, and famous voice actors, I feel like they could have set apart a bit of money to save themselves from total international embarrassment. Or simply not have used this much Engrish to begin with. (Seriously though, is that how Japanese kids talk these days? I really hope not). \\n\\n\r\nBesides the songs, some seiyuu also sounded pretty questionable when acting out regular dialogues. While I have no problem with male voice actors sounding ridiculously childish or ridiculously manly, I simply couldn't stand Cecil's weird voice. Although I've often found some female voices in anime to sound annoying, this has never happened with male voices to me before, so this was another aspect in which UtaPri 2 managed to surprise me (albeit in a negative way, too). \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, (though I don't know whether this was due to his annoying voice or his general lack of personality), Cecil just pretty much sucked as a character. Despite  supposedly being \"foreign\", he doesn't happen to have an obvious accent when speaking Japanese. Instead, he speaks incredibly slowly and his slurred speech combined with excruciatingly long pauses make him sound like he's mentally impaired rather than simply from a foreign land. As if that wasn't enough, he also happens to tag along to literally every single \"event\" or \"happening\" in the show and just adds unnecessary dialogue, weirdness and ridiculousness to it (though I've kind of learned to take the latter as a good thing). \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Cecil is neither the first nor the last unnecessary character in this anime. While it could be argued that he added a teeny tiny bit to the plot progression and development of the series, the same cannot be said about all the other new characters (e.g. the members of Quartet Night and Heavens). \\n\\n\r\nWhen Quartet Night was first introduced, its four new guys seemed just as flashy and flamboyant as all the others and it looked like they had potential to become interesting characters. As the story went on, however, they were essentially forgotten and were always seen lurking in the background complaining about everyone and everything else. Near the end of the series, one of them finally did something \"important\" (which could have easily been accomplished by any regular member of Starish), and which also happened to remind us that they were actually, well, there. \\n\\n\r\nAs the creators of the anime remembered the existence of Quartet Night, they tried to give them some minimal (and rather rushed) character development in the last two episodes, but of course this pretty much failed. Why keep introducing new characters if you're never going to develop them or use them for anything else? \\n\\n\r\nThe epitome of undeveloped characters, however, are definitely the members of \"Heavens\". They're repeatedly labeled as \"cool\" and \"amazing\", but this is always hard to believe since they're never shown doing anything other than bragging. (Ok, so they do sing one song at the end, but that's about it). Mind you, I was initially excited about this new idol unit / group / band / whatever because it meant hearing another one of my favorite seiyuu in one of my not-so-favorite anime, but given the excessive amount of characters in this 13-episode series, he only got to say about 5 lines, at most. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I did keep my focus and attention on this show throughout its 13 episode run (unlike when I was watching SAO, Clannad, and other boring crap which constantly had me looking at my phone). \\n\\n\r\nWhether it's because of its explosion of color and flamboyance or for its sheer ridiculousness and lack of credibility, this anime is oddly addicting and is therefore far from being blatantly bad. Sometimes bizarre, sometimes crazy, and almost always grammatically inaccurate, the second season of Uta no Prince-Sama is one worth watching if not for its fickle plot and too-many characters, then at least for its beautiful art, its rather decent animation, and, to use the finest internet lingo of our day and age, \u2014 \"for the lolz\". While you won't come out of watching this anime feeling more enlightened, I guarantee that you'll at least come out feeling oddly entertained and strangely amused.",

            "content": "This season was better. 1000%. \r\nHowever, it still wasn't the cleanest it could've been. For example, this is a music, shoujo, romance, whatever-you-wanna-call-it anime right? Then, why the hell is there a character in here that was under a magical curse as a cat? That threw me way off in the first season, and it didn't get better here. On top of that, harems leave a lot of room for error because you never have enough time to properly develop the relationships between the characters well enough before trying to shove them into a romance. Plus, harems always end up being fanservice because the maincharacter never sticks to a person. That way, you can ship them with anyone you want. That gets annoying after a while, though I've managed to overlook it for the most part. So, that was still a bit clunky.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I think this anime is melting my brain because I'm enjoying it a lot more than I probably should be. It's kind of addicting, these characters and this anime. The way the characters are written, they kind of draw you in and hold you there until you can't escape. So, at the very least, this anime does have very entertaining characters. In fact, I'd even say that the character development we got from them this season was really nice, especially since it wasn't overshadowed by other things like in the first season. Now that everyone's base relationships have been established due to the first season, this season was able to dig in a bit more into every character's past, which was nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was a lot more cohesive as well. Other than the transfiguration cat situation, the anime stuck to a genre and did it pretty well. Everything (almost) in the season contributed to the overall goal of STARISH trying to win the Uta Pri Award. There were no conflicting plotlines happening, and I appreciated that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing: if you don't like corny harems that have way too much emotion, then do not watch this. It'll bug the hell out of you. However, if you wanna have a good time and just let your brain wander, this is a great anime for you. For all of its faults, this anime is really fun, and the story can even tug on your heart a bit at times. I gave this anime a bit of shit in the first season, but I'm kind of hooked now. I'm definitely gonna keep up with it, that's for sure. I may even have a few new characters on my hands.",

            "content": "UtaPri2 leaves UtaPri1 in its DUST.\r\nI remember UtaPri1 being a little hard to follow - you were immediately launched into the story, there were colourful bishies everywhere (making things a little harder to concentrate) and characters were difficult to keep up with (I always got Masato and Tokiya mixed up). But as UtaPri1 came to an end, I kind of wanted to watch more.\r\nI found UtaPri2 to be mindblowingly brilliant. From the first to last episode, I really enjoyed it. There's at least one episode dedicated to each member of STARISH; the storyline is a lot more gripping; character development is much improved; the animationis bright, cheery and colourful; and most of the songs are plain awesome. Especially the OP. (In my opinion, best OP EVER. It's fabulous. OHMYDAYS I LOVE IT. If you haven't watched the anime yet, go watch this OP.) I also found a lot of it to be very, very funny (and it takes a lot for me to laugh at an anime).\\n\\n\r\nA little more on character development - the talented, bright-eyed, slightly emotional, slightly ditzy, majorly airheaded heroine doesn't change all that much - one thing I've noticed with this season is that she becomes a lot more confident, and is no longer afraid to put her foot down and stand up for herself. As for the bishies in this reverse-harem, we all see a load more of character development from them all, but I don't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a very happy anime. It has its cheesy moments, but what's a good anime without them? If you don't like bishies, bright colours, musicals, reverse-harem, or otome-to-anime-adaptions, this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if it's not - you should know that the battle of the bands arc at the end is AMAZING. I still have the chills.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10: I liked the storyline a lot! Much improved from season one.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10: The art is very colourful and well-thought-out, and many of the character's outfits have a lot of interesting details.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10: The OP. I never skipped it. Not even once. As for the rest of the songs, we see a variety of genres spanning the series, and I'm sure at least one of them will appeal to your tastes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10: Again, the character development was very well done; however, nearly all personalities are a little clich\u00e9 to that of your typical reverse-harem, otome-to-anime-adaption, shoujo anime. But for an otome-to-anime adaption, character development was really good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10: What can I say? I love bishies, bishies being kawaii, bishies being hilarious, bishies singing beautifully, bishies being passionate and bishies wearing colourful pretty things.\\n\r\nI Am Sane.\\n\r\nSeriously though. I really love this season. The funny moments, the music, the characters all made it explode into a happy pulse (you'll get that last bit when/if you watch all 13 episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10: TEN! (Are you ready?) NINE! (Are you ready?) EIGHT! (Are you ready?) SEVEN! SIX! FIVE! (Are you ready?) FOUR! (Are you ready?) THREE! (Are you ready?) TWO! ONE!\\n\\n\r\n... ... ... Yeah, I kinda liked it.",

But they could easily do without that curse, stilldon't know why that's even in there. It does nothing to help the story and his character. (I am watching S3 right now and it becomes clear that ridiculous things like that are common here but more on that later when I write my review of S3)\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is quite entertaining as the story is more about STARISH and their journey and less about Haruka, which helped the story a lot. The guys and their growth are way more interesting. I don't really dislike Haruka, but she is so dull and annoying at times that I don't really care for her either. It would actually be a much better show if you'd cut her and the magical hoo-ha all together, but yea, reverse-harem and such, I get it and I'll deal with it. But lost chances, people, that's all I'm saying. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I like the art, everything is beautifully drawn, so I have any negative things to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the best parts and I'm even ashamed to admit it, but even though I don't speak the language, those songs made me get up to sing and dance which I didn't expect. I caught myself humming the tunes of MAJI LOVE 1000 % and MAJI LOVE 2000 % more than once and have already added those songs to my playlist.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched UtaPri Maji Love 2000 % in one sitting, something I really, really did not expect. It is in my opinion a lot better than the previous season I hope they'll continue on this track. I found myself laughing at things that weren't meant to be funny. But I'm starting to think that that's kind of the point? Maybe not, but still, I had a blast.\\n\\n\r\nGive this season a chance. What I've learned by know is that while it's really easy to point out it's major flaws, you don't have to take this anime seriously at all. If you just take it for what it is, there is a great chance you will enjoy it. It is by no means a masterpiece, but it will give you a couple laughs and you'll have fun watching it.",

It definitely helps that they give you a better look into the guys' lives by having them deal with their various jobs based on their specialties(acting, modeling, etc), and having them overcome their problems. I felt it focuses a bit more on the guys than Haruka, than season 1 did, but maybe that's just me.\r\nIfyou love the cheesiness of the anime...  you will absolutely LOVE the ending.

I really quite love how they draw the males in particular, because they aren't too girly or too manly. Their eyes aren't too big or too small. Their faces are nice and shapely, without being too detailed/manly. They're just perfect to me.\\n\r\nThe one thing that bothers me(and probably many others), is Haruka's eyes. They are boringly generic and too big/wide in shape compared to the guys, but the colors... I wonder what made them think that neon puke-green and laser-lemon yellow would look ok on someone's iris... Well, at least it's... unique? I quite like how her hair is not quite pink, and not quite orange... More like a neon salmon color?\\n\r\nI do find the blond hair colors in this anime to be too yellow, well, unless they are supposed to be yellow rather than blond.\\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Tokiya's hair. That subtle indigo color is really one of my favorites for hair.\\n\r\nAlso note, there are a LOT of sparkles and \"glitter\" effects in this anime. That either makes a scene look beautiful, or makes it look corny, or a mix of both.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOf all of the music-oriented anime I have watched, UtaPri has the most songs on my playlist. They are genuinely catchy and well-made. Naturally, the lyrics are cheesy, but hey, it sounds GOOD, and that's all that matters to me. The opening to both season 1 and 2 are both wonderful, with vocals done by Tokiya's sexy and incredibly-talented voice actor, Mamoru Miyano. \\n\r\nAll of the characters' voices are beautiful in song and have their own unique sound to them so none of them sound the same and you can tell who's singing what line. I definitely prefer Shou's voice when he sings in softer tone, than the usual cheerful tone, though.\\n\r\nI personally quite like how Tokiya's and Masato's voice sound together in the ending theme.\\n\r\nIf you love vocal music, you will probably LOVE the music in this. The singing skills of the voice actors are incredible.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe only reason I did not rate this 10, was because of Haruka's boringness and passiveness. I'm also not fond of her high-pitched falsetto voice. \\n\r\nOf course, that isn't enough to keep me from enjoying this anime. The personalities of all the male characters more than balances it out.\\n\r\nOne thing I like about the males, is that they aren't 100% stereotypical tropes from every anime. They are mixes of different tropes and might have subtle bits of this or that personality, and best of all, they compliment each other. One thing I like about Utapri that most other otome genre anime lacks, is that the guys actually interact with each other... they get along with each other and become close friends, or they compete and have rivalries. At the same time, there are some that do have their conflicts with each other, such as Ren and Masato, and that gives them a pretty deep character development, or as deep as Otome candidates can get.\\n\r\nThe heroine is not stealing all of their attention 100% of the time, and she's more like a supporting character or friend to the guys, but also not cast aside as she has very important roles. I think that's one of the things that makes a typically boring heroine enjoyable/bearable in an otome anime, so you can't completely hate her.\\n\r\nThe addition of a new band member also adds excitement as we learn about him and what he must face, along with how he will interact with others(he was in the first season, but had never met the guys until now).\\n\r\nAlong with the new band member, there are also the 4 new characters who act as the bands' mentors. I couldn't really get a taste for the two taller ones as they felt too similar personality-wise to each other, but I really loved the shorter two, especially Mikaze(though they do not reveal his uhh secret in the anime, but you may have guessed it if you notice how he talks).\\n\r\nAlso, just like in season 1, the headmaster voiced by Norio Wakamoto is in this series. He is as flamboyant as he was in season 1, so that keeps the series as fabulous, if not more, than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI gave this a 10 because, well, it was enjoyable. I loved every minute of every episode, and there were some times where I could not stop laughing due to the pure cheesiness of it all. Even when there wasn't anything particularly funny or cheesy going on, it was always exciting and had something happening. I enjoyed it all, both the serious and funny moments. The music is really exciting to watch in the anime as well.\\n\r\nI actually liked this a lot more than the first season. The character development goes on and beyond, and the guys even get jobs and struggle with their past or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a light-hearted and fun anime, even guys may find they enjoy it at least for the character development, music, or even just to make fun of the cheesy humor.\\n",

The art is beautiful, the music always gave(and still gives) me chills, and the characters are actually fairly well developed. Overall, it was a pretty damn good sequel.\r\nOf course, there wasn't too much of a plot. But of course, that's to be expected, after all, it is an anime mostly based off of music. But the plot that was included was developed. It was interesting. It is fairly obvious as to what might happen next, but that doesn't really take away from it.I know there were times when I was on my toes, even though I knew what would happen, just waiting for it to happen.\\n\r\nThe show is funny. There is a lot of good comedy. There were a lot of times when I was just dying of laughter. It actually reminded me a bit of... perhaps K-On!? Well, either way. Anyone who decides to watch this sequel won't be disappointed from the comedy that drifts on from the first season. All the characters are still hilarious when they decide to be.\\n\r\nThe music is gorgeous. One shan't be disappointed from the music this anime possesses. If you enjoyed the music from the first season, you will adore the music in this season. I'd say that it is possible to really hear the heart the voice actors put into this. You could hear them really enjoying themselves as they recorded their songs. Personally, I'd give the music more than a 10 out of 10 if I could...\\n\r\nCharacters are even more so developed in this season! They all go far more in depth! HOORAY!\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this sequel. I suggest to anyone who wants to possibly watch it and give it a chance, go right ahead! You will not regret it. It is truly a fun anime to watch. Anyone who is apprehensive about watching this, give it a shot. If you liked the first season, then you will most definitely enjoy the music and returning/added characters of this season.",

            "content": "Some of you may remember me from my repressed review of Uta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000% . But like a moth burnt by the flame, I never learn my lesson. I'm back, baby. \nUta no\u2606Prince-sama\u266a Maji Love 1000%  introduced us to some vapid and brightly coloured characters who quickly grew a place in our hearts like a shockingly virile parasitic worm. \nThere's, you know, \"her\" / \"thing\" / \"soup-eyes-chan\" / \"pink\" (or as some call her, \"Haruka\"), the girl who can't sing - sorry, I'm thinking of the rest of the cast - I mean, read music. And then there's the rest of thegigolos, \"hime-cut\", \"manwhore\", \"blue guy with irritating vibrato\", \"heart-defect-kun\", \"guy who voiced a prison guard in Enzai\", \"yatta\", etc. These, our beloved friends. They have returned to us. \\n\\n\nCecil is bored with being a cat and a grandmother and decides to enroll in Gigolo School with the rest of the cast. Unfortunately he brings with him a gaggle of other cast members. I would guess there was two dozen in all. It's difficult because they all came without their personalities. Don't forget your drinking games - drink when every new character is introduced and we'll end up colour-blind, hey girls?\\n\\n\nAlong with Cecil's janitor or whatever, there's the addition of a rival gang of senpai singers (presumably they were touring the world during the first season, or at least the countries that aren't anti-LGBT). Seems like these senpais finally noticed them. Well done boys. BTW, did you know the band's official name is STARISH? I thought it was Uta Pri. Not STAR, or STAR-like, just an 'ish'. Like, you know, they're not quite celestial orbs... more like glow in the dark watch faces. This is who we're rooting for. \\n\\n\nAs well as Senpais, STARISH (who knew, right?) are competing against HEBENSU for the Uta Pri Prize. Gee, with a name like that, I wonder who will win?\\n\\n\nOK, sit back, 'cos I know you've edged towards the very boundary of what constitutes a seat. Time for some spelunking in what little depth this series has. Don't worry, we won't need a snorkel. \\n\\n\n*Music*\\n\\n\nThe music this time round is much the same. Various themes used throughout were forgettable. We skipped the OP every time, it's an anal waxing of a song. The ED is a little better. Of course it's incorporated into the final episode (as always). It's bland, too many parts, and for a long time I thought it spelt out STARFISH, but no, it was STARISH. That is, until Cecil joined the band, who saw that coming? He obviously brought with him the 'F'.*\\n\\n\nP.S. Image songs were enough to drive me to violent crime. Blue guy's especially verges on animal abuse.\\n\\n\n*Animation*\\n\\n\nDepressingly high standard as usual. There's a lot less chibi this time round, obviously someone read my review.\\n\\n\nThe fight scene in one episode went shounen for a while, it was an amusing aside to take me away from my crushing despair over everything this anime stands for. \\n\\n\nLess inside mist than the first series. \\n\\n\nHaruka's fashion is a bit more toned down this time round, or maybe my retinas are just scorched.\\n\\n\n*Voice acting*\\n\\n\nMade me wish I was deaf.\\n\\n\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\nI didn't. \\n\\n\nSaotome is pretty much the saving grace of this series. Saotome is kind of Michael Jackson meets Goku. He talks in Engrish a lot and has a (sadly late) rivalry with someone called Raging who dresses like a pimp. I am shocked and saddened that we cannot date him. \\n\\n\nAll in all, 2000% no.",

Sequels are notorious for not being up to par with it's origional series, but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. This anime is lighthearted and just absolutely fun to watch. By no means is it going to be some sort of \"drama masterpiece\" if that's what you're looking for. The story had potential, but with the series only having 13 episodes it would be rather difficult to get too far into each of the main character's backgrounds. The comedy bits in this series kind of remind meof Ouran Highschool Host Club, and I actually found myself smiling and giggling in a few scenes. \\n\\n\r\nYou have your stereotypical shoujo anime male personality types ...the mysterious, the smart, the playboy, the feminine one, ect... however, in my opinion, the writers were able to execute each of their characters smoothly. The female lead can come off a little dry but she surprises you at certain moments throughout the episodes. Her personality is very cute and endearing. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all its a great show for a shoujo anime. The artwork is beautiful, the songs are fun, they characters make you laugh, and you find yourself cheering on for at least one of the guys to get the girl. My only complaint is there aren't enough episodes for the writers to have added a little more drama into the anime and spend more time on each character as an individual. Hope others enjoy watching this series as much as I did :) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: The anime will continue where it left off, following the steps of Haruka to become a famous composer, along with her friends Otoya, Masato, Natsuki, Tokiya, Ren, Syo and Cecil, whose dream is to become idols.\r\nHowever, it won\u2019t be easy for the boys as they\u2019ll have to pass a strict exam supervised by the idols Reiji, Ranmaru, Ai and Camus. For those who already watched the first episode then i bet most of you love it just like i do.. Ive been waiting for this season two to come out, im so excited to watch the ep. 1 and when it's been finally aired,those waiting days didnt disappointed me at all! It's worth it.. \\n\\n\r\nArt: just like the season one, Uta no Prince-sama 2000%'s art is good too but should i say it became better than the season one? There arent any changes at the characters' faces or whatsover but if you watch the season one first ep. And the season two first ep. You will see the difference on how it became better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: sound... Yeah sound! XD lets talk about it... The songs are sooo awesome! The opening, i like it very much especially the song which the quartet night sang when they introduced themselves! The voice, the so called wave when they sing are just so awesome! The song poison kiss is like a drug to me XD i became so addictive in that song even if the full version isnt out yet (im anticipating to it XD) their songs evolved to the next round ...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: as you all know, there are new characters like camus,ai,ranmaru and reiji. You can say that they are all bishies just like our fav. Characters ittoki,natsuki,syo, ichinose,masato,cecil and ren. If you like the cool type then go for ranmaru, for the girls who like ittoki then reiji is right for you :D.. And hmm... For ai (which is my fav chara from the group quartet night XD) if you know flan of katekyo hitman reborn, they are kinda look a like and ai looks like the silent type for me and lastly, if you like guys who are kinda cold then camus is the right for you xD....\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: if you're a girl who squeals or who gets easily flustered when an anime guy does something sweet for the girl then you will find it here :D the seven main characters (boys) are all soo sweet to our fav. Composer nanami. The atmosphere is kinda funny too, so if you like kaichou wa maid-sama, special a and other animes which has a fluffy and sweet genre that will make you kyaaa then this anime suits you, so if you're that type just like me then watch this, i promise... You wont be disappointed at this anime coz it will give an enjoyment which you like :D..\\n\\n\r\nHope this is helpful for you...",

            "content": "Maji Love 2000% picks up the story where the first season left off. After making their - successful - debut, they are supposed to pick up the pace and become even more successful. They are to follow a special program while pursuing their careers. \r\nI did read all the reviews before me, the general consensus seems to be that it is as good as if not better than the first season. I do not share that opinion.\r\nIn my opinion:\r\nStory:  While the story wasn't brilliant - not that I expected it from this anime - the first season, there was indeed more plot. To startwith \"cataract\" Minami and her inability of reading sheet music, which was the leeway to her sickly childhood. \\n\r\nThere was the individual stories of every single one of the boys, from family member coldness of Jinguuji, to burnout of Hayato/Ichinose. Not only that but more importantly all those single stories got connected somehow to one fluid plot.\\n\r\nThe  second season does not have fluidity. There are single episodes that deal with the members of Starish but those do not really connect to each other. Then final/highpoint arc is introduced, Heavens vs Starish, and ... no, except for my  suspension point there is really no build up in the story towards the end. The competition is announced in episode 11 cataract-girl struggles in episode 12 and bum you have the - obvious and over the top - resolution in 13.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Except for cataract girl I really have no complaints. One could say I actually watched it for the art, as in bishounen. And yes, they are so, so, so, so very beautiful! If I could scoop out the eyes of Minami I would be ecstatic. But all things said and done, the beauty of the boys and the landscape (seriously, the schools in both seasons are like castles and the greenery and the lake, ..., I really wanna be there too!) numbs my brains and I forget about her creepy eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I liked the music in the first season so much better. In my opinion compared to first season the sound of second season is pathetic. I have heard more entertaining and effective jingles than the songs of the second season. And if that is not enough they are pale imitations of the first season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Maji Love 2000% is trying to compensate for the lack of plot via introducing a bunch of new bishounen. While visually considered I have no earthly complaints, I have to say, the season ended and none of those characters really helped the plot in any significant or insignificant way. They were just very pretty to look at.  When they were first introduced as the sempais to help Starish members to become more \"idol\"y I expected for them to do something. Anything. Guide, or help at a crossroads of life or something. At the end, they were there. And they were pretty. Then there were the 3 members of Heavens. The evil act was just so funny that I have no complaints. Albeit, I am guessing it wasn't meant to be funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy it. Because let's be honest, if you are going to watch this kind of anime, you do not have or you should not have high expectations regarding the plot. So I took it on the face value and I did enjoy myself watching all the bishounen and making fun of cataract Minami and laughing at the antics of Saotome. I was sorry to see less of Hyuga Sensei and Ringochan and Tomochan but it is understandable with only 13 episodes you cannot thin out the plot more than its already watery self. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you are in the mood something light and soul uplifting; with a plot that won't engage your brain in the least, curb your expectation and watch this. It is an anime with a lot of bishounen and beautiful landscape and acceptable sound.",

I can't tell you. As someone who truly, with a burning passion, did not like the anime, I'm surprised I even made it  to the second season. There's just something strange and creepy about this anime that made me feel such intense emotion, and the urge to complete it.\r\nI may have liked this season more than the first, but the plot it still so, so shitty. Whoever came up with the plot forthis second season...I'd like to think that they don't  exist. That being said, I came into the first season with little expectations. If I was to put my expectations into a numerical form, they would be at about 0.001. So I actually am proud to say that this anime exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice and vibrant, but seeing as I really don't like bishies, or Nanami's creepy ass eyes for that matter, I had to rate it an 8. I probably would have rated this a 1 if the art was really bad.\\n\\n\r\nCecil and the DPD guy were the only memorable boys in the smorgasbord of men. Seriously, how many of them were there?\\n\\n\r\nI will never forget this anime. My taste in anime has gotten better over the (months) but my hatred of UtaPri only intensifies. I want to be a little la on this anime, seeing as it was a game, but I just can't. Even La Corda D'Oro was better than this, and that's a game as well.\\n\\n",

The show is funny, cute and brings great music to enjoy all the way through to the end! The only problem I have with it is that the female lead doesn't seem to understand a single thing that is going on.. A little more involvement from her side would be great in my opinion. But I guess making her a plain jane is sort of the point to make us all feellike WE are actually part of this hot story! I mean, lets not forget this is all based on a visual novel of love.  \\n\r\nIn terms of if this is worth watching or not.. YES. This season honestly picks it up a notch from last time, so if you even remotely enjoyed season 1, i suggest you make the effort to see past the somewhat poor story development here and enjoy the guys at their best! \"doki doki\"\\n",

            "content": "- Haruka, what's so great about Starish? \r\n- They sparkle, and that makes me want to watch them forever.\r\nAlthough it may sound silly as an inspirational quote, the reality is that it sums up this anime pretty well. While you may not find great life lessons or cultural facts to be learned from this show, you'll definitely find some sparkle in it (lots of it, in fact), so if that's your thing, then Uta no Prince-sama 2 is definitely for you.\r\nHaving gone from being 1000% about \"real love\" to being 2000% about it, things definitely get more intense. From the extra sparkle to theexcessive and awkward use of Engrish (in both songs and dialogues), the protagonist's eyes have become even creepier, the school even prettier, the lines even cheesier and the guys even more flamboyant. Besides all these \"intensifications\", new guys also join the picture and range from \"professionals\" to wannabes (along with the odd prince). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you've seen the first season, then you probably know that, no matter how many boys join the cast, Shining Saotome will always be the man. Seriously, he's still the best thing about this show and probably will continue to be for all the seasons to come.\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than write an essay about all the redeeming qualities of this wonderful character, I will instead point out some of the strengths and weaknesses this second season had so that you may decide whether you actually want to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of the overall look and style of this show as well as the art and animation, then I have good news for you. These have definitely improved and the characters no longer look like they're convulsing during the dance sequences. This doesn't save them from continuing to look completely ridiculous, but hey, that applies to more than one aspect of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough no girl is silly enough to believe that they can be surrounded by almost a dozen males all fighting for her attention, UtaPri 2 takes the \"unbelievable\" to  the next level. From adding princes mentioned above to settings and outfits that are even more lavish and extravagant than those in the first season, this show loses what little credibility it had beforehand. While I have seen my fair share of schools that are simply too pretty to be real in shows like Ouran Koukou Host Club, Vampire Knight, and Diabolik Lovers (notice how only reverse harems take place in fancy schools?), the academy in UtaPri 2 is on another level altogether. As if that wasn't enough, the protagonists also engage in spontaneous tea drinking in the foyer and have thousands of roses delivered to their love interest's dorm room, because, hey, isn't that what all high schoolers and college students do?\\n\\n\r\nEvery single time when I thought that this anime couldn't get any more ridiculous, it always managed to prove me wrong. This inevitably made it pretty addicting, even if it was for all the wrong reasons. In many ways, UtaPri 2 is \"so bad it's good\". \\n\\n\r\nFrom an opening that sounds like it's trying way too hard to be cool and edgy to an ending that pretty much sounds exactly the same as the one used in the first season, the songs are just as bubbly and forgettable as all the ones used before. Additionally, the main characters now all come with their own songs too, which sound... Cringeworthy. Although some of  the songs were okay (and I know that they were performed by experienced seiyuu who underwent rigorous singing training), most of these character songs sounded outright bad and again made this show almost too embarrassing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime, however, is the Engrish. Although I know that actual JPOP songs throw in some Engrish about 90% of the time, UtaPri 2 songs not  only use it 100% of the time, but also happen to do it pretty terribly. From phrases like \"believe heart\" and \"release sing\" to \"let's peace\", \"let's song\", and, my personal favorite \u2014 \"we love song\", the use of terrible grammar is just another aspect which makes this anime unintentionally hilarious. I mean, would it really have killed them to hire an English language consultant? While I understand that a lot of the budget for this anime must have gone to fancy special effects, artists, animators, and famous voice actors, I feel like they could have set apart a bit of money to save themselves from total international embarrassment. Or simply not have used this much Engrish to begin with. (Seriously though, is that how Japanese kids talk these days? I really hope not). \\n\\n\r\nBesides the songs, some seiyuu also sounded pretty questionable when acting out regular dialogues. While I have no problem with male voice actors sounding ridiculously childish or ridiculously manly, I simply couldn't stand Cecil's weird voice. Although I've often found some female voices in anime to sound annoying, this has never happened with male voices to me before, so this was another aspect in which UtaPri 2 managed to surprise me (albeit in a negative way, too). \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, (though I don't know whether this was due to his annoying voice or his general lack of personality), Cecil just pretty much sucked as a character. Despite  supposedly being \"foreign\", he doesn't happen to have an obvious accent when speaking Japanese. Instead, he speaks incredibly slowly and his slurred speech combined with excruciatingly long pauses make him sound like he's mentally impaired rather than simply from a foreign land. As if that wasn't enough, he also happens to tag along to literally every single \"event\" or \"happening\" in the show and just adds unnecessary dialogue, weirdness and ridiculousness to it (though I've kind of learned to take the latter as a good thing). \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Cecil is neither the first nor the last unnecessary character in this anime. While it could be argued that he added a teeny tiny bit to the plot progression and development of the series, the same cannot be said about all the other new characters (e.g. the members of Quartet Night and Heavens). \\n\\n\r\nWhen Quartet Night was first introduced, its four new guys seemed just as flashy and flamboyant as all the others and it looked like they had potential to become interesting characters. As the story went on, however, they were essentially forgotten and were always seen lurking in the background complaining about everyone and everything else. Near the end of the series, one of them finally did something \"important\" (which could have easily been accomplished by any regular member of Starish), and which also happened to remind us that they were actually, well, there. \\n\\n\r\nAs the creators of the anime remembered the existence of Quartet Night, they tried to give them some minimal (and rather rushed) character development in the last two episodes, but of course this pretty much failed. Why keep introducing new characters if you're never going to develop them or use them for anything else? \\n\\n\r\nThe epitome of undeveloped characters, however, are definitely the members of \"Heavens\". They're repeatedly labeled as \"cool\" and \"amazing\", but this is always hard to believe since they're never shown doing anything other than bragging. (Ok, so they do sing one song at the end, but that's about it). Mind you, I was initially excited about this new idol unit / group / band / whatever because it meant hearing another one of my favorite seiyuu in one of my not-so-favorite anime, but given the excessive amount of characters in this 13-episode series, he only got to say about 5 lines, at most. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I did keep my focus and attention on this show throughout its 13 episode run (unlike when I was watching SAO, Clannad, and other boring crap which constantly had me looking at my phone). \\n\\n\r\nWhether it's because of its explosion of color and flamboyance or for its sheer ridiculousness and lack of credibility, this anime is oddly addicting and is therefore far from being blatantly bad. Sometimes bizarre, sometimes crazy, and almost always grammatically inaccurate, the second season of Uta no Prince-Sama is one worth watching if not for its fickle plot and too-many characters, then at least for its beautiful art, its rather decent animation, and, to use the finest internet lingo of our day and age, \u2014 \"for the lolz\". While you won't come out of watching this anime feeling more enlightened, I guarantee that you'll at least come out feeling oddly entertained and strangely amused.",

            "content": "This season was better. 1000%. \r\nHowever, it still wasn't the cleanest it could've been. For example, this is a music, shoujo, romance, whatever-you-wanna-call-it anime right? Then, why the hell is there a character in here that was under a magical curse as a cat? That threw me way off in the first season, and it didn't get better here. On top of that, harems leave a lot of room for error because you never have enough time to properly develop the relationships between the characters well enough before trying to shove them into a romance. Plus, harems always end up being fanservice because the maincharacter never sticks to a person. That way, you can ship them with anyone you want. That gets annoying after a while, though I've managed to overlook it for the most part. So, that was still a bit clunky.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I think this anime is melting my brain because I'm enjoying it a lot more than I probably should be. It's kind of addicting, these characters and this anime. The way the characters are written, they kind of draw you in and hold you there until you can't escape. So, at the very least, this anime does have very entertaining characters. In fact, I'd even say that the character development we got from them this season was really nice, especially since it wasn't overshadowed by other things like in the first season. Now that everyone's base relationships have been established due to the first season, this season was able to dig in a bit more into every character's past, which was nice. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was a lot more cohesive as well. Other than the transfiguration cat situation, the anime stuck to a genre and did it pretty well. Everything (almost) in the season contributed to the overall goal of STARISH trying to win the Uta Pri Award. There were no conflicting plotlines happening, and I appreciated that a lot.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing: if you don't like corny harems that have way too much emotion, then do not watch this. It'll bug the hell out of you. However, if you wanna have a good time and just let your brain wander, this is a great anime for you. For all of its faults, this anime is really fun, and the story can even tug on your heart a bit at times. I gave this anime a bit of shit in the first season, but I'm kind of hooked now. I'm definitely gonna keep up with it, that's for sure. I may even have a few new characters on my hands.",

            "content": "UtaPri2 leaves UtaPri1 in its DUST.\r\nI remember UtaPri1 being a little hard to follow - you were immediately launched into the story, there were colourful bishies everywhere (making things a little harder to concentrate) and characters were difficult to keep up with (I always got Masato and Tokiya mixed up). But as UtaPri1 came to an end, I kind of wanted to watch more.\r\nI found UtaPri2 to be mindblowingly brilliant. From the first to last episode, I really enjoyed it. There's at least one episode dedicated to each member of STARISH; the storyline is a lot more gripping; character development is much improved; the animationis bright, cheery and colourful; and most of the songs are plain awesome. Especially the OP. (In my opinion, best OP EVER. It's fabulous. OHMYDAYS I LOVE IT. If you haven't watched the anime yet, go watch this OP.) I also found a lot of it to be very, very funny (and it takes a lot for me to laugh at an anime).\\n\\n\r\nA little more on character development - the talented, bright-eyed, slightly emotional, slightly ditzy, majorly airheaded heroine doesn't change all that much - one thing I've noticed with this season is that she becomes a lot more confident, and is no longer afraid to put her foot down and stand up for herself. As for the bishies in this reverse-harem, we all see a load more of character development from them all, but I don't want to spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a very happy anime. It has its cheesy moments, but what's a good anime without them? If you don't like bishies, bright colours, musicals, reverse-harem, or otome-to-anime-adaptions, this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if it's not - you should know that the battle of the bands arc at the end is AMAZING. I still have the chills.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10: I liked the storyline a lot! Much improved from season one.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10: The art is very colourful and well-thought-out, and many of the character's outfits have a lot of interesting details.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10: The OP. I never skipped it. Not even once. As for the rest of the songs, we see a variety of genres spanning the series, and I'm sure at least one of them will appeal to your tastes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10: Again, the character development was very well done; however, nearly all personalities are a little clich\u00e9 to that of your typical reverse-harem, otome-to-anime-adaption, shoujo anime. But for an otome-to-anime adaption, character development was really good.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10: What can I say? I love bishies, bishies being kawaii, bishies being hilarious, bishies singing beautifully, bishies being passionate and bishies wearing colourful pretty things.\\n\r\nI Am Sane.\\n\r\nSeriously though. I really love this season. The funny moments, the music, the characters all made it explode into a happy pulse (you'll get that last bit when/if you watch all 13 episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10: TEN! (Are you ready?) NINE! (Are you ready?) EIGHT! (Are you ready?) SEVEN! SIX! FIVE! (Are you ready?) FOUR! (Are you ready?) THREE! (Are you ready?) TWO! ONE!\\n\\n\r\n... ... ... Yeah, I kinda liked it.",

            "content": "Ok, nobody is as surprised as I am, but I actually really enjoyed season 2 of UtaPri.\r\nFor those among you that have read my review about the first season know that while I had no real issues with this season, the utter ridiculousness that was the cursed cat was a bit too much for me.\r\nBut I'm actually glad that I forced myself to finish S1 and thus continue watching the remaining seasons of UtaPri and the main reason is that stupid ass cat.\r\nCecil became one of my favorite characters and made me chuckle quite a bit. But they could easily do without that curse, stilldon't know why that's even in there. It does nothing to help the story and his character. (I am watching S3 right now and it becomes clear that ridiculous things like that are common here but more on that later when I write my review of S3)\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is quite entertaining as the story is more about STARISH and their journey and less about Haruka, which helped the story a lot. The guys and their growth are way more interesting. I don't really dislike Haruka, but she is so dull and annoying at times that I don't really care for her either. It would actually be a much better show if you'd cut her and the magical hoo-ha all together, but yea, reverse-harem and such, I get it and I'll deal with it. But lost chances, people, that's all I'm saying. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I like the art, everything is beautifully drawn, so I have any negative things to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of the best parts and I'm even ashamed to admit it, but even though I don't speak the language, those songs made me get up to sing and dance which I didn't expect. I caught myself humming the tunes of MAJI LOVE 1000 % and MAJI LOVE 2000 % more than once and have already added those songs to my playlist.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched UtaPri Maji Love 2000 % in one sitting, something I really, really did not expect. It is in my opinion a lot better than the previous season I hope they'll continue on this track. I found myself laughing at things that weren't meant to be funny. But I'm starting to think that that's kind of the point? Maybe not, but still, I had a blast.\\n\\n\r\nGive this season a chance. What I've learned by know is that while it's really easy to point out it's major flaws, you don't have to take this anime seriously at all. If you just take it for what it is, there is a great chance you will enjoy it. It is by no means a masterpiece, but it will give you a couple laughs and you'll have fun watching it.",

            "content": "\"The award for cheesiest anime ever goes to Uta no Prince-sama Maji Love 2000%.\"\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe story of the first season was pretty straight-forward, while this season has a bit more going on at a time. I felt that this season was a lot more exciting and had more to offer story-wise. It definitely helps that they give you a better look into the guys' lives by having them deal with their various jobs based on their specialties(acting, modeling, etc), and having them overcome their problems. I felt it focuses a bit more on the guys than Haruka, than season 1 did, but maybe that's just me.\r\nIfyou love the cheesiness of the anime...  you will absolutely LOVE the ending. It's the cheesiest thing ever to be thought of by humankind.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art of UtaPri is always beautiful and colorful. Not only the colors, but even just the shapes are beautiful. I really quite love how they draw the males in particular, because they aren't too girly or too manly. Their eyes aren't too big or too small. Their faces are nice and shapely, without being too detailed/manly. They're just perfect to me.\\n\r\nThe one thing that bothers me(and probably many others), is Haruka's eyes. They are boringly generic and too big/wide in shape compared to the guys, but the colors... I wonder what made them think that neon puke-green and laser-lemon yellow would look ok on someone's iris... Well, at least it's... unique? I quite like how her hair is not quite pink, and not quite orange... More like a neon salmon color?\\n\r\nI do find the blond hair colors in this anime to be too yellow, well, unless they are supposed to be yellow rather than blond.\\n\r\nI'm quite fond of Tokiya's hair. That subtle indigo color is really one of my favorites for hair.\\n\r\nAlso note, there are a LOT of sparkles and \"glitter\" effects in this anime. That either makes a scene look beautiful, or makes it look corny, or a mix of both.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOf all of the music-oriented anime I have watched, UtaPri has the most songs on my playlist. They are genuinely catchy and well-made. Naturally, the lyrics are cheesy, but hey, it sounds GOOD, and that's all that matters to me. The opening to both season 1 and 2 are both wonderful, with vocals done by Tokiya's sexy and incredibly-talented voice actor, Mamoru Miyano. \\n\r\nAll of the characters' voices are beautiful in song and have their own unique sound to them so none of them sound the same and you can tell who's singing what line. I definitely prefer Shou's voice when he sings in softer tone, than the usual cheerful tone, though.\\n\r\nI personally quite like how Tokiya's and Masato's voice sound together in the ending theme.\\n\r\nIf you love vocal music, you will probably LOVE the music in this. The singing skills of the voice actors are incredible.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nThe only reason I did not rate this 10, was because of Haruka's boringness and passiveness. I'm also not fond of her high-pitched falsetto voice. \\n\r\nOf course, that isn't enough to keep me from enjoying this anime. The personalities of all the male characters more than balances it out.\\n\r\nOne thing I like about the males, is that they aren't 100% stereotypical tropes from every anime. They are mixes of different tropes and might have subtle bits of this or that personality, and best of all, they compliment each other. One thing I like about Utapri that most other otome genre anime lacks, is that the guys actually interact with each other... they get along with each other and become close friends, or they compete and have rivalries. At the same time, there are some that do have their conflicts with each other, such as Ren and Masato, and that gives them a pretty deep character development, or as deep as Otome candidates can get.\\n\r\nThe heroine is not stealing all of their attention 100% of the time, and she's more like a supporting character or friend to the guys, but also not cast aside as she has very important roles. I think that's one of the things that makes a typically boring heroine enjoyable/bearable in an otome anime, so you can't completely hate her.\\n\r\nThe addition of a new band member also adds excitement as we learn about him and what he must face, along with how he will interact with others(he was in the first season, but had never met the guys until now).\\n\r\nAlong with the new band member, there are also the 4 new characters who act as the bands' mentors. I couldn't really get a taste for the two taller ones as they felt too similar personality-wise to each other, but I really loved the shorter two, especially Mikaze(though they do not reveal his uhh secret in the anime, but you may have guessed it if you notice how he talks).\\n\r\nAlso, just like in season 1, the headmaster voiced by Norio Wakamoto is in this series. He is as flamboyant as he was in season 1, so that keeps the series as fabulous, if not more, than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI gave this a 10 because, well, it was enjoyable. I loved every minute of every episode, and there were some times where I could not stop laughing due to the pure cheesiness of it all. Even when there wasn't anything particularly funny or cheesy going on, it was always exciting and had something happening. I enjoyed it all, both the serious and funny moments. The music is really exciting to watch in the anime as well.\\n\r\nI actually liked this a lot more than the first season. The character development goes on and beyond, and the guys even get jobs and struggle with their past or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to anyone looking for a light-hearted and fun anime, even guys may find they enjoy it at least for the character development, music, or even just to make fun of the cheesy humor.\\n",

The art is beautiful, the music always gave(and still gives) me chills, and the characters are actually fairly well developed. Overall, it was a pretty damn good sequel.\r\nOf course, there wasn't too much of a plot. But of course, that's to be expected, after all, it is an anime mostly based off of music. But the plot that was included was developed. It was interesting. It is fairly obvious as to what might happen next, but that doesn't really take away from it.I know there were times when I was on my toes, even though I knew what would happen, just waiting for it to happen.\\n\r\nThe show is funny. There is a lot of good comedy. There were a lot of times when I was just dying of laughter. It actually reminded me a bit of... perhaps K-On!? Well, either way. Anyone who decides to watch this sequel won't be disappointed from the comedy that drifts on from the first season. All the characters are still hilarious when they decide to be.\\n\r\nThe music is gorgeous. One shan't be disappointed from the music this anime possesses. If you enjoyed the music from the first season, you will adore the music in this season. I'd say that it is possible to really hear the heart the voice actors put into this. You could hear them really enjoying themselves as they recorded their songs. Personally, I'd give the music more than a 10 out of 10 if I could...\\n\r\nCharacters are even more so developed in this season! They all go far more in depth! HOORAY!\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this sequel. I suggest to anyone who wants to possibly watch it and give it a chance, go right ahead! You will not regret it. It is truly a fun anime to watch. Anyone who is apprehensive about watching this, give it a shot. If you liked the first season, then you will most definitely enjoy the music and returning/added characters of this season.",
