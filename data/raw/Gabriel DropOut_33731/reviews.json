            "content": "If I learned something from watching Gabriel DropOut, is that going to hell is definitely the superior option. Get ready for this hilarious comedy that reverses the roles of angels and demons!\r\nThe story is simple but interesting due to the comedic setting it creates: our protagonist, Gabriel, was a kind, top tier angel who always helped others. However, after coming to Earth she developed an addiction to online videogames and became incredibly lazy. From there we meet other angels and demon with personalities that don't fit the standards we give to them, creating lots of great comedic situations playing around that. Going back to Gabriel,I love how much of an asshole she can be to the others, it's a fun twist to the happy and kind main protagonist we usually have in these type of stories.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying that role instead, we have Vignette, an \u201cangelic demon\u201d if that makes sense. Being completely different to Gabriel, she is a very responsible and kind-hearted girl who is always there to help and bring happiness to everyone around her. How can a demon be this pure? No idea, but I can already tell you that she has some of the most heart-melting smiles that anime can provide. Next we have Satania, the cutest, most \u201cevil\u201d demon that exists. In order to conquer the Earth, she will do things as terrifying as refusing to do her homework or recycling a water bottle with the cap still on. I'm genuinely scared, I swear! As scary and powerful as she wants to be, she still miserably fails at everything and is the constant subject of bullying from Gabriel, and especially from Raphiel, that completes the main cast. Don't let her angelical looks fool you, she's a sadist that has teasing Satania as her favorite pastime. I have no idea what's going on in heaven to have girls like this as the most promising angels. \\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut has the biggest concentration of best girls I have seen in quite a good time, all of them are great and likeable, and the interactions between them are so fun to watch. It doesn\u2019t matter who you choose as your favorite, secondary characters like Tapris, an adorable angel that surprisingly behaves like an angel included, you are picking a great and lovable character.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design, backgrounds, and overall art style of this anime is well executed but nothing mindblowing. I felt that compared to other Doga Kobo works it didn't have as many impressively animated scenes as usual, however, the story itself doesn't really have that many moments for them to happen, and when there is the chance, they are done and look great, so I have no objections. In the sound department is mostly what I expected from a comedy anime, with songs that fit well with the tone, but aren't really that memorable. The same can't be said for both the opening (Gabriel Drop Kick) and the ending (Hallelujah\u2606Essaim) two great songs sung by the voice actors of our four main characters that are two personal favorites of this season. From the opening I especially love the part where the tone of the music adapts to whichever character is singing, using a calmer tone for the angels and a more intense one for the demons. The ending theme is mostly made by nice looking still shots together with the really catchy song.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gabriel DropOut is a very entertaining comedy anime that plays with the interesting idea of angels and demons and subverts your expectations of what their personalities should be like.   I personally had a blast watching it, really enjoying each episode and getting so attached to the characters over the course of the series. I can't see how an anime that made me look forward for the Mondays doesn't deserve to be a favorite of mine heh, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a nice comedy series to watch!\\n",

            "content": "My opinion:\r\nAt first glance, Gabriel Dropout seems nothing special and definitely does not stand out but it is actually a hilarious show that had me laughing till my stomach hurt.\r\nQuality wise Gabriel Dropout is not very good, it has a simple generic plot with some of the most stereotypical characters I have seen but that did not stop the show from being so damn entertaining.\r\nI\u2019ve decided to write this review in a more lively manner that better suits the show, doing so was fun.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nUpon passing a school in heaven, graduating angels are sent down to Earth with the duty to learn about and guidehumans towards the correct path in order to become full-fledged angels. Gabriel is the top angel in her class, dreaming about going to Earth and helping people but as soon as she actually arrives on Earth she becomes addicted to video games and turns into a complete slob as a result. The story follows Gabriel, along with other angels and demons who have descended to Earth, as they attend high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not complex or linear but rather simple with episodes presenting different stories that more often than not, do not relate to other episodes, but that doesn\u2019t stop the overall story from feeling fluid.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, demons often behave like little angels while angels behave like pseudo-demons, twist which I really liked. On one hand, we have the angel Gabriel saying she doesn\u2019t care about humans and joking about destroying humanity to cover up her \u201cpantie sighting\u201d, on the other hand, we have the demon, Vignette, who often cares for Gabriel, worries about other angels and even plays with children in the park. This \u201cchange of roles\u201d goes to show that what you are doesn\u2019t always describe or define the way you act.\\n\r\nFinally, the jokes. This show sells its humour very well with the main source of humour being the character chemistry, the interrelations of the characters are well-done and often result in hilarious situations that cracked me up. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it is quite dumb to say angels are born like humans and that they live and behave like families, that\u2019s very far from the way it actually is but, what am I talking about? This is a comedy so I\u2019ll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe character cast is small yet effective, working well together and almost always perfectly delivering the jokes. The characters are more like antithesis of their archetype, with angels acting like demons and vice versa, which was quite a clever touch to the show\\n\r\nTo be honest, the cast of Gabriel Dropout consists of some of the most generic tropes I\u2019ve seen in anime but they work so well together and are so likable that it doesn\u2019t matter if they are generic or not.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel is an angel who was the top of her class but soon after her descent to Earth, she became addicted to video games and turned into a slob. She is often lazy and unmotivated and has a rather bossy attitude, which I could relate to since that is the way I was in highschool, like many other teenagers. An angel got corrupted by the human way of living, that is hilarious and also true, humans are social beings that will adapt to society and because angels are portrayed to be so much like humans, it is only natural that they would react like humans.\\n\\n\r\nVignette is the complete opposite of Gabriel, she is very responsible and often looks after Gabriel, contrary to her actual role as a demon. She often cooks and worries about others, she\u2019s an \u201cangelic demon\u201d to call it that. I find her character to be the best and the most intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nSatanichia, she\u2019s an egotistical demon who often thinks of weird ways to cause mischief which usually end in failure. She has no sense of taste and is often pestered by Raphiel and often falls victim to stray dogs. \\n\r\nIf I was to give Satanichia a role, it would be that of the failed villain because her \u201cdevious\u201d acts and plans often end up in failure due to her stupidity. I personally found her character a bit irritating but not bothersome.\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel is the second ranked angel in Gabriel's class, who has since become a sadistic stalker who takes delight in teasing Satanichia. I found her character hilarious due to her constant teasing of Satanichia which I could relate to, since I used to do the same to my friends but on a smaller scale.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation are lively and colorful, the characters\u2019 facial expressions are well done and fitting for the show. Aside from one beach episode, there wasn\u2019t much fan service, lack of fan service which I found great. Overall, the art and animation are good but nothing spectacular, it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nHaving a nice opening theme, a decent ending theme and a pretty good OST with the voice actors doing a good job interpreting the characters, I would say the overall sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I was laughing for the entire duration of the show, even though some jokes were overused I still found them funny, maybe because I was in the mood for a comedy show. Anyway, I highly enjoyed this show and I don\u2019t regret one second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nA very good comedy show that stands out not because it has great quality production but because it is highly entertaining. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for a lighthearted show that will give you a good laugh, I recommend giving Gabriel Dropout a try.",

            "content": "Every now and then, I often go through a bucket list of things when deciding to pick up a new anime. Make no mistake, Gabriel Dropout\u2019s list consists of some of the most generic tropes you\u2019ll discover in anime. Does that automatically make the show unwatchable? Absolutely not. I mean, the show is like a soup with all sort of generic ingredients in it to bring out the flavor. However, it\u2019s a show that can also be a delight for fans who wants to see some colorful entertainment.\r\nOn the surface, the series doesn\u2019t really stand out much. It\u2019s essentially about angels and demons who havedescended to Earth to learn about humans and their life style. Main female protagonist Gabriel \u201cGab\u201d graduated at the top of her class but upon landing on Earth, she becomes a lazy hikikomori who is more interested in video games than anything else. It doesn\u2019t take long for viewers to understand what her character is like as the first episode establishes her role as pretty straightforward. The other characters also take little time to make their way into the story as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs a slice of life story, there\u2019s not much linear storyline or complex plot going on. Every episode consists of segments that makes up for its storytelling. In fact, most episodes can consist of multiple storytelling segments with little relations to another. However, what makes this show special is the character cast. It\u2019s a small yet effective character cast that consists of Gab, Vigne, Satania, and Raphiel. Gab and Raphiel are the angels while Satania and Vigne are the demons. Contrary to what viewers may expect, these characters are more like antithesis of their archetype. Gab hardly has an angelic personality but is instead portrayed with a lazy and spoiled attitude. Satania is pretty much a harmless villain as her devious behavior is often overshadowed by her own idiocy. The idea is that these characters all came to Earth to adapt with society. Yet, they have their own motives that is satirized by comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the humor of this show plays a big role to fulfill enjoyment. Like most comedy/slice of life stories, it tries to sell its humor and does it quite well. The most effective way it does so is with the character chemistry. With such a small cast of characters, we can easily see how their relationships are without overthinking it. Take Satania and Raphiel for instance. Raphiel often teases Satania while the latter tries to cause mischief with hilarious results. On the other hand, Satania always tries to \u201ccompete\u201d with Gab but somehow falls short for whatever reason that comes up. Vigne stands at the middle ground as she a more mature character yet also has her own outrageous moments. That being said, the show also introduces some lesser impactful characters that spice up the character chemistry. One of the more noticeable characters though is Tap, an angel that adds her own bits of magic into this show. In retrospect, the key success to these characters isn\u2019t how their roles are portrayed but rather how they bring the show\u2019s humor to life.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, the adaptation is faithful but doesn\u2019t follow every chapter in a linear order. I can also say with disappointment that there were some chapters that should have been adapted. As a standard 1-cour show of 12 episodes, it\u2019s not all too surprising. In the meantime, the humor can be a hit or miss for some fans. Its attempt to sell comedy will not meet everyone\u2019s standards and from the first episode, it can be the deciding factor of keep or drop. Finally, I have to admit that Gabriel Dropout lacks character development. There\u2019s not much change to any of the main characters while we don\u2019t learn much background story about them either. While some could say that slice of life stories like this doesn\u2019t need them, it can still be disheartening for fans who are more interested in those elements.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Doga Kobo, the show is quite colorful. Literally, every character stands out in some way from their different hair colors and their extra accessories. (Gab\u2019s halo, Satania\u2019s devil-like hair piece, Raphiel\u2019s crosses, etc) Production quality is also simple yet effective to bring out the gimmicks. There\u2019s not much fan service (although there\u2019s a beach episode) so expect more or less comedy as the series\u2019 main way of servicing the fans. The character expressions also works quite well to supplement with the show\u2019s humor.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack isn\u2019t all too impressive although it gets down the idea right for its OP and ED theme songs. What should feel impressive is the character voice mannerisms. They fit them so well. Gab\u2019s voice really makes her sound like a lazy sloth while Satania\u2019s devilish laughs gives her the impressions of a devil. By the time I finished watching Gabriel Dropout, I felt like the character voices really outdid themselves.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Gabriel Dropout? It sounds like a tough question but really has a simple answer. If you fancy comedy without relevancy with its storytelling, then this is the show for you. It has humorous gags and characters shine with their personalities. However, if you\u2019re more into something serious or development in storytelling, then look elsewhere. For me, this series has the virtue of being funnier than what it looks like. Now that\u2019s a certain kind of fun.\\n",

            "content": "Doga Kobo might not be the absolute biggest name in the anime industry but if there is one thing they have truly made a name for themselves for, then it is their aptitude at making moe comedies. With an repertoire including the likes of Himouto Umaru-chan, New Game and of course the legendary Yuru Yuri among others, this is truly the studio's specialty. Adding to this lineup, this season we now have Gabriel DropOut, which once again showcases just how to make this genre shine at its very brightest.\r\nGabriel DropOut can briefly be described as role-reversed angels and demons turned moe. The story mainly followstwo angels and two demons, who all end up moving from Heaven and Hell respectively to the human world upon starting high school. The catch is that the angels in question are a lot less admirable than you might expect, whereas the demons are not particularly evil. It is a simple twist on paper, but it ends up working to great comedic effect more often than not in this rather mean-spirited comedy show.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the nature of the anime, it is unsurprisingly largely character-driven. First of all there is the show's supposed main character Gabriel, named after the archangel. She is someone who used to be a picture-perfect angel with the most pristine, beautiful smile whose sole intention was to spread as much happiness as possible in the human world. That is until she one day randomly ends up playing an MMO as a healer in order to help the other players (how the game ended up on her laptop in the first place is never explained but whatever), only to find that people were dying when she ran out of mana, causing her to purchase an exclusive premium healing staff for real money in desperation. And this turns to be the starting point of Gabriel quickly going down a slippery slope until she eventually becomes a self-centered game addict and a hikikomori. In other words, basically a lost cause and in this case a fallen angel. She is rather reminiscent of Doma Umaru from Himouto Umaru-chan in this sense, but Gabriel is even more hopeless since unlike Umaru she 1) does not put in any effort in school or try to keep up appearances either, and 2) fully embraces the NEET lifestyle and does not even try to improve herself whatsoever, much to the dismay of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, her best friend is Vigne (who I think is supposed to represent the demon Vine but I am not sure), a very diligent and kind-hearted demon who only wants to help people. Her devotion manages to get Gabriel to at least get out of her room and attend school sometimes, but unfortunately that is not the way demons are supposed to behave, and thus she sometimes finds herself in just as much trouble as Gabriel regarding lack of financial support from back home. The poor girl just cannot find it in herself to be evil as much as it is expected from someone in her position.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone who most definitely wants to be as evil as possible though is the so-called \"future queen of hell\" Satanichia\u2014more commonly known as Satania\u2014which is quite obviously a feminized version of Satan. She is perhaps the real star of this show as most of its funniest gags revolve around her... or rather her misfortune. Put simply, Satania is an idiot, and her attempts at being evil always end in complete failure. Also, the other girls are generally pretty mean to her in return for all the nuisances she creates. This is undoubtedly the most mean-spirited part of the show as Satania is most often treated as the butt of everyone else's jokes, but it works out surprisingly well because of the light-hearted nature of it all (and let us be honest here, quite a lot of the abuse she is given is well deserved).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough pretty much everyone has a piece of Satania every now and then, the main culprit behind Satania's torment however is the fourth and final of our main characters: Raphiel (named after the archangel Raphael). She is a former classmate of Gabriel's from their days up in Heaven, and whilst she may look like a model honor student at a glance, she is actually both a sadist and a huge troll whose favorite pastime is manipulating and toying with Satania in various ways. As she already proved in Prison School, HanaKana is surprisingly adept at voice acting sadistic girls, and the case with Raphiel's character is no different.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much in the way of actual plot progression throughout the show. There are a couple backstory segments showcasing how Gabriel and Vigne first met, and in some of the latter episodes we also get to see some more glimpses of what Heaven and Hell look like when the girls temporarily go back home on vacation, which also lets us meet their families. Beyond that though, the show mostly consists of standalone skits (usually like four segments per episode or so), however that is totally fine because this is purely a comedy show at heart, and quite a lot of the time it is actually legitimately hilarious. I cannot actually label it as the comedy of the season for the simple reason that KonoSuba 2 happened to be airing simultaneously, but during any normal circumstances it certainly would be. Granted, humour is very subjective so I cannot promise anything, but at the very least I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut is not a complicated series, but it executes its own premise excellently and delivers a consistently enjoyable and momentarily hilarious experience. Combined with Doga Kobo's typical clean and shiny moe art style (and a fantastic ED I might add), it all amounts to one of the best moe comedies I have seen in quite some time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: For whatever reason, Crunchyroll's subtitles for this anime are absolutely cringeworthy. In what universe does \"Itadakimasu~\" translate to \"Through the Dark Lord Amen\" if I may ask? Keep your 4chan memes away from my subs please, because if you think you are being funny I am sorry to disappoint you. Hopefully some fansub group will pick this show up and retranslate it from scratch sometime in the near future so that it might actually be bearable to read.",

            "content": "There are two ways I look at Gabriel DropOut. One is as a CGDCT anime and the other is as a comedy. While the two usually go very well together I separate the two of them for a reason. As a CGDCT anime Gabriel DropOut is alright. Vinge and Satania are cute, and at least Gabriel has a cute design, even if her personality is annoying. However, as a comedy anime it is painful.\r\nThe biggest issue I have with Gabriel DropOut is that it's not funny. Many of the jokes all boil down to the same thing: \"The angels act like demons and the demonsact like angels.\" That's actually an interesting idea but the problem is it's not very funny. And it's certainly not funny enough to fill up 12 episodes. However, still the show likes to repeat this joke over and over and over and over again. That and Satania bullying (having funny mean things happen to Satania) is the bread and butter that this show has. Both of which got boring pretty quickly. They do sometimes mix in other jokes but even those jokes fall flat most of the time because it's predictable how they end up. Some of them are jokes I've seen from other shows in the past. The execution of these shows as well tends to be lackluster. There isn't enough variation in the setup or the punchline of the joke so it only adds to that samey feeling. Comedy is subjective but I have a hard time understanding what's so funny about this show. Rather it's attempts at humor usually annoy me more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from good to incredibly grating. As it turns out the demons fall into the former camp while the angels fall into the latter camp. Satania is dumb but can be pleasant to watch due to her attitude and the life she brings to the show. Vigne is basically a normal girl as a demon so like a normal girl, she's cute as well. I wouldn't consider either of the characters very well developed as the show never really pulls them apart from their normal behaviour or gets them into situations where they have to grow. There was a moment with Vigne where she showed some more depth but for the most part, the show lacks in that department. That said the two demons are fine characters and at least are likeable. The issue with these two is that it depends on who they're paired up with for how enjoyable each segment is. They're usually paired with the angels which sadly doesn't help them out.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel is a whole mess of issues. First off she's basically an okatu character played straight. She's never more interesting than that, and her cynicism and her lack of caring get really annoying to watch. It's even more so annoying when they make up this backstory of her being a perfect little angel before getting tainted by the modern world and video games. That actually could have been an interesting story if Gabriel cared about retaining her angelic nature and if it happened slowly through time. Instead, it takes one night, throwing out all illusion of having character development or depth in exchange for a cheap laugh that isn't even funny. What's worse than her bland and uninteresting personality is that there's nothing that makes her likeable. She usually ends up acting pretty mean to her friends, which only serves to make her character less likeable. Thusly. I have no reason to want to see her on the screen nor care about her well-being. It even hurts her cuteness because she has a great design yet it's hard to really adorable or enjoy the looks of someone who I don't like. The ruins part of the magic that could be there.\\n\\n\r\nRaphael is a sadist, and if she had any redeemable traits that'd be ok. But she doesn't. Rather she's pretty much a sadist and nothing else. Her target of prey is poor Satania. Sometimes this works well and is funny but most of the time it doesn't. Satania bullying only really works when Satania is being played due to her own faults. Otherwise, it's cruel and seems unfair for poor Satania. What did she do to deserve being bullied? She has her flaws but not enough to justify the amount of bullying she receives in the show. I personally have a problem with characters getting mistreated whether by the world or by other characters and since it ends up happening so often it only adds to the annoyance that this show can provide. But going back to Raphael, that is the main point of interest with her, and probably the only notable one. And like Gabriel, she gives no reason to like her, and thusly she's annoying to have to watch, as well as again being a bland character. \\n\\n\r\nUnlikeable characters are fine when there is a purpose behind them. Say if they are villains, or if they're used well for comedy. However, the comedy gotten from these characters are stale and not worth while. Furthermore, they clash against the notion of caring about the girls which hurts the CGDCT aspect of the show. The show doesn't work that well all together, and the root of the cause is its failed comedy. Thusly, I imagine how one feels about Gabriel DropOut depends on how funny one finds it. If one finds it funny then it's some of these problems feel like less of an issue. But personally I didn't, and thusly I relied on the characters to win me over. While Vinge and Satania worked, the angels did not, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Gabriel DropOut's poor attempts at humor there were a couple of episodes that did shine. These episodes proved that the show can throw in some good material when it wants to. There is a later character that appears named Tapris who is proof of this. However, the show spends more time mulling around the same jokes to really go anywhere and that's it's loss. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were solid throughout but never seemed notable enough to give it praise. The music was ok, although I don't really care for the OP very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is inconsistent and has issues with its humor and its characters, however, it is pretty cute and does have some merits. This is a show that you can probably tell whether you'll like it or not from the first couple of episodes. They never really move on from that type of material. Personally, I don't recommend it but there are worse shows to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAn unimportant note: The CR subs for this show were absolute trash. They kept on inserting random jokes instead of translating the actual line. Although that's CR's fault not Gabriel DropOut's fault.",

            "content": "An angel and demon comedy, I've definitely seen something similar to this before... *eyes hataraku maou-sama*\r\nLet me start by saying that this anime was a lot better than I thought it would be. Normally, I like to wait for anime to finish airing before I watch them, but this season I wanted to try something different - so I chose something I thought would be average. So far, this anime seems to be pure comedy with no plot to be seen - just four cute girls living their lives on Earth, doing cute things.\r\nHowever, even without a plot, it's not at all boring nor averagelike I had assumed it would be.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very silly slice of life and the past 4 episodes have been really enjoyable. It's nothing outstanding, but definitely something that will keep you excited when the next episode comes out. The OP and ED are also very pleasing and impossible to skip over (at least in my opinion), they give that familiar vibe that gets you excited for what's next to come in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeable, funny and their character designs are simple but still stand out. The roles of angels and demons have switched; the demons are pure while the angels are immoral/careless. Our first angel and the main protagonist, Gabriel, was once a hardworking student and is now a lazy shut-in who skips school and couldn't care less about anything other than her MMO's. Raphiel, the 2nd angel, happens to be a very mischievious character who slyly portrays herself as the nice girl. And the last two demons are Vignette: a very mature demon, and Satania: a demon who tries too hard to be evil but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed anime like New Game, K-ON, Love Live!, then you might enjoy this as it has cute girls doing cute things, BUT the main thing that differentiates them from Gabriel DropOut is that they have ambitions while GD does not, but instead offers only a cute comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is nothing new and original, but it does a good job with what it has. Overall, I would recommend to give this anime a shot! It'll be worth it, and you might even receive a new favorite character.\\n\\n\r\n***might be updated***\\n\\n",

            "content": "-PREVIEW-\r\nStarting of the year 2017, we have Gabriel DropOut! A slice of life and comedy series about the everyday lives of 4 cute girls [Heaven and Hell] living in human world after graduating from their respective 'schools'. There's a lot more SOL, CGDCT anime aired this season.\r\nGabriel DropOut to me is quite interesting to watch. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime clich\u00e9 as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girlsdoing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off. Making the anime series, to be linear or in par with the manga I've started reading before this series is even aired. A plus of it, would be the comedic scenes by the characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, handled by Doga Kobo which their animations are nicely done and the use of manga iconography is there to express the characters emotions. Most of their background areas and the city scenes are the Doga Kobo standards, which I've seen already a lot in which Doga Kobo produced such as Himouto Umaru Chan. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the series from Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song by far is the best song for Winter 2017 in my perspective, due to it's vocals mixing both the angelic voice and heavy rock voice together which makes a fantastic OP song to hear, I've would even repeat this song every time. Most of the OST songs are very decent and has a very quite familiar tone to that Umaru Chan, in which most of the staffs who produced this Anime is from Umaru chan.  Most of the seiyuus are pretty new, well we do have Hanazawa Kana who voiced Raphi. However, all the seiyuus are doing fantastically well in their debuts.\\n\\n\r\nI'll talk more about the characters once I've released the full review. However, SATANIA-CHAN IS THE BEST GIRL FTW!\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first four episodes were aired, I really enjoyed watching Gabriel DropOut not only due to having the same staff from Umaru Chan, but the comedies and the gags that this series had produced that made everyone laugh and making the series more enjoyable then ever. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, enjoy watching Gabriel DropOut! I definitely would recommend this anime to those who are slice of life/CGDCT lovers out there.",

            "content": "Gabriel Dropout was genuninly a nice surprise for me. Coming into this show with hardly any expectations whatsoever, I left feeling satisfied with a fun show with good comedy and a cast of characters that I actually liked by the end. This show doesn't do anything remarkable in terms of its narrative or characters but it remains a fun ride throughout, and the characters are both enjoyable enough, and their chemistry between each other feels natural enough to carry the weight of the show.\r\nGabriel Dropout is about a fallen angel named Gabriel, who visits Earth originally as a means of learning more about Earth culture(but only visits Japan to achieve this, ignoring all of the other hundreds of cultures but, hey whatever), but, as she becomes addicted to the world of online gaming, she falls into depravity, changing from a sweet, kind \"butter wouldn't melt\" type character to the lazy, self-centred lie about. During the duration of the show, she meets new demons and reunites with old angel friends who have yet fallen and have come to Earth to learn more about its culture and customs. And that's pretty much it for the narrative. The rest of the show involves the characters in random situations and scenarios, that gets funnier as the show goes along. It took a little while for me to warm up to the show, I think the first three episodes, while still being fine, were not as interesting overall as the latter. When the characters had all been introduced, I was having much more fun with the show overall, mainly due to how fun all of the characters are in this series. While the individual archetypes for the characters had been done before, each one bounces off of each other rather effectively and there is a good enough variety in jokes (for the most part that is) to carry the comedy. There were a few moments in which the comedy was a little TOO stupid for my taste, such as when Satania takes the dog and travels all the way to a far off land; my main problem is that the joke went on for too long. Similarly, there were also some jokes that I felt were either unfunny or kind of fell flat on their face, but these moments didn't take too much away from the show to the point where it ruined it for me and these moments were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is also interesting as a dynamic is that two of the character's archetypes, that being an angel and a demon, are switched around, and while I wouldn't go as far as to call this a subversion of themes or anything, this addition still adds another layer onto the comedy of the show. In terms of characters, there are four central ones; two demons and two angels. Gabriel, as previously mentioned, is the fallen angel who spends the majority of her time playing games and just generally being a worthless member of society. She has her share of funny lines and personality traits, but most jokes with her are just about her lifestyle. Granted, as the series went on, the comedy with her became more funnier, as a result of the more expressive reactions the voice actress and the animators could muster. Vignette, was also a fun character who plays the straight man, or straight woman in this case and despite being a demon, she is perhaps one of the kindest and sweetest people ever. We have Raphiel, another angel who spends most of the time laughing at the expense of the other characters or laughing at Satania, who, in my eyes is the best character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSatania is essentially a wannabe arch demon who thinks she is evil as all hell, but her attempts at being evil come down to her announcing that she hasn't done her homework boldly in class or starting a fight over a dog who keeps stealing her melon bread. She is delightful and fun to watch, as she attempts all of these various \"evil\" plots and schemes which always amount to her getting the short end of the stick in the end. There are other characters, such as Gabriel's older sister who makes an appearance in the final episode and is charming in her own way but for the main crust of the show, it focuses on these four, which isn't so bad considering how fun they all are. The show just needed a little more variety in order to bump the score up a little more higher. In terms of animation, the show has a very bright colour pallet and the animation, particularly in the final episode is great. It was produced by the same people who made New Game last year, which also had very attractive looking character designs and animation. The soundtrack was also pretty good, and held together pretty well, but is pretty forgettable aside from the opening and ending tracks which are fun and fit the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gabriel Dropout is a fun show with fun characters and I do recommend it to anyone looking for something easy and fun to each whilst delivering entertainment.\\n\\n",

Before watching it I was a bit undecided about the animation, I thought it could fail, but finally, I gave it an opportunity. \r\nThe story is very simple; an angel gets corrupt with the human entertain methods in this case video games. The angel change of mind and become a fallen angel that doesn't care about anything, is lazy, sometimes annoying but is fun to watch. The angel meets certain demons that become her friends. \r\nThis simple story has some holes. There are parts unconcluded, unexplained but is the same with the manga. The idea of astory is based on short arcs that change from episode to episode. These arcs are defined by moments of their lives such us school life, vacations, illness, etc. The jokes sometimes are very silly but in general, are well executed, and with the progression of the characters you will enjoy them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the best part of the animation. Each character has they distinct personality that is a complement between all them. They aren't angelical, and they aren't evil. They are just friends that try to understand the world in their way. The character art is very colorful and blends very well with the moment of the story and the actions of the scenes, After seeing the episodes when a character isn't there you will miss it. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are good, so far there are only three, but they are funny, and the sound was good for this animation. In general, this animation was good, funny and wasn't annoying. You should give it an opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if there is going to be a second season, the manga is being published and will take time to have enough stories for it, but if there is a second season I will be watching it. \\n\\n\\n",

Gabriel Tenma White, valedictorian of her graduating class, proves one of the most promising angels of the time, that is, until she became corrupted by human living. Thanks to the addicting nature of MMOs, she found herself drawn to lifestyle of a hikikomori, becoming what she proudly refers to as a \u2018faillen angel\u2019. Her friend, kindly demon Vignette Tsukinose April, does what she can to help Gabriel get on the right track, yet to no avail. With the sadistic Raphiel and delusional Satania along for the journey, these four supernatural teens come to learn the lines that separates angel, demon, and human are easily blurred.\\n\\n\r\nAs we follow the daily lives of the four, the main attention point is how contrary they act to how you\u2019d expect. Gabriel, an angel formerly top of her class, has devolved into an unreliable, lazy shut-in. Vignette, a demon straight from Hell, manages to be a responsible, caring, and otherwise altruistic friend. Raphiel is devilish in her own right, developing all sorts of pranks and such for Satania, self-proclaimed \u201cfuture archdemon\u201d and the one character who at least tries to act like she should, though usually to her own dismay (and our enjoyment). Scenes generally concern themselves with character interactions, and with the great characters that we receive, most of them are fun and generally humorous.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s a set lore in place, most of the series concerns itself with the daily events in the lives of the girls, effectively branding the anime a Slice of Life. Unfortunately, an issue that seems to place most in this genre is the very predictable episodic structure. As usual, yes there are holiday episodes, along with a beach journey earlier on. How badly (or positively?) the formulaic approach affects your experience will differ from person to person, and it\u2019s not too big of a deal for me. There\u2019s also a few fanservice-y scenes, though nothing too prevalent. Enough to please those who enjoy it and respect those that don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a comedy anime, and I actually found it to be pretty hilarious at times. Comedy in Slice of Lives, particularly, are subjective, so not everyone is going to get the same enjoyment out of it. I can tell you that if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I wouldn\u2019t bother watching, as that\u2019s its primary selling point aside from character relationships. There are a few recurring gags that are generally funny and mostly revolve Satania getting screwed over, though at times they can get a bit repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, it would have been very easy for the creators to just add the fact there are \u201cangels\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d as a selling point, but I have to say the fact they weren\u2019t humans really did help give the series more substance. A lot of the actions and dialogue relied on the interrelationships between angels and demons or those beings and humans, which in turn also helped support the comedy. In the latter half of the series, there were a couple episodes that involved the four returning to their respective realms in Heaven or Hell, presenting some really fun scenes from both zones.\\n\\n\r\nWorth mentioning too is that, perhaps as a complement to the rising trend of hikikomori in Japan, the main character exhibits many traits usually absent from a protagonist in her laziness, social withdrawal, and general apathy. With other protagonists similar to this in Kazuma Satou of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! and Umaru Doma of Himouto! Umaru-chan, it\u2019s becoming more prevalent that Japan is attracting this particular audience in their future creative works. If this is a sort of archetype you enjoy, you\u2019ll find yourself pleased with Gabriel overall, but take note that she does take it a bit further and act like a bit of an asshole at times, explained better later on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Himouto! Umaru-chan, you\u2019ll come to find out the animation is strikingly similar, especially in terms of facial representation, background animation, and scenery. Both were animated by studio Doga Kobo, which I can say does a satisfactory job overall. Slice of Life anime rarely go above and beyond in terms of visual technique, but Gabriel DropOut performs well by enacting bright, exciting visuals with lively characters, however there are often cases of \u201cresting same face\u201d that don\u2019t detract too heavily from its overall aesthetic. That being said, I always have a soft spot for when characters have striking color palettes, and each of the four girls have one, so good job.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t say I was too impressed with the music. This is by no means saying it wasn\u2019t acceptable, rather it\u2019s that standard, generic Slice of Life soundtrack you\u2019d expect to hear on almost any series within the genre. A few episodes had some good moments, notably those involving the coffee shop, but otherwise you won\u2019t be looking to buy the discs.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu performed their roles very well, with no complaints with any performance. Two VAs did stand out well, particularly with Miyu Tomita nailing Gabriel\u2019s monotone, even bored attitude and Naomi Oozora really seeming to understand the character of Satania, with her air of self-importance captured in detail.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the otherwise underwhelming soundtrack, I did enjoy both the opening and ending themes, both of which were performed by the characters themselves (always a welcome benefit).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAs any good Slice of Life anime will require, the characters within Gabriel DropOut are unique, entertaining, and otherwise lovable. While Gabriel serves as the primary character, Vignette, Satania, and Raphiel receive ample amounts of attention, allowing fans of either or all to be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel Tenma White, our titular \u201cfaillen angel\u201d, has made radical changes since her visit to the human world. Thanks to the intoxicating nature of video games, she has forsaken any sort of altruistic goals her previous self may have set, focusing only on living her life as a hikikomori. Due to her apathetic nature, she often comes off as a bit of an asshole, though she does have her moments where she lets her true feelings for her friends pour out.\\n\\n\r\nVignette Tsukinose April is perhaps the strongest character in her stability and attitude. She functions quite strongly as Gabriel\u2019s foil, always trying to help her friend get focused back on her duties as an angel, though she herself seems to act the most angelic of the four. Despite this, she tries her hardest to prove she can be a true demon, but no one is really convinced.\\n\\n\r\nSatanichia Kurumizawa McDowell is easily the most enjoyable character of the series, and the one from whom much of the comedy originates. Though dim-witted and unintimidating, she has delusions of grandeur in that she will become the future archdemon of Hell. Originally the self-proclaimed rival of Gabriel, she comes to befriend the angel as she had no friends otherwise. There\u2019s also a little doggo that comes and steals her melon bread at every opportunity, what a dick!\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel Ainsworth Shiraha is a sneaky little devil, no pun intended, and thrives in the misfortune of her companion, Satania. Large-busted and sadistic, a lot of the comedy also comes from Raphiel, as her pranks, not only on Satania but Vignette too.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other characters introduced, including Tapris (Gabriel\u2019s easily fooled kohai), Machiko (class president), and the unnamed coffee shop owner (Gabriel\u2019s boss and coffee lover), though none of them have particularly large roles outside of being relevant to a given episode\u2019s plot (or subplot).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut is best described as one of those series that doesn\u2019t quite earn the sticking power of a great one but leaves you feeling satisfied and content with your time spent following its conclusion. Much of this is attributed to the fact that it felt very formulaic in its Slice of Life plot progression, though it performs well in offering four lovable characters whose interactions entertain you from episode to episode. These types of anime are not for everyone, and you can pretty much tell whether or not you\u2019d enjoy it from a quick glance, but those that do will find themselves pleased with what\u2019s offered.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLike,  humanity can just go to Hell and die for all I care.\u201d \u2013 Gabriel",

            "content": "If an angel came down to earth to live like a human being, what would they act like. What kind of lifestyle will they pursue? Well in this anime. It can go in many directions. Ladies and Gentlemen one of my personal favourite comedies, Gabriel DropOut.\r\n I will be reviewing the episodes as an anime-only watcher.\r\nStory (9)\r\nMeet Gabriel, the oh so perfect angel that will solve all the problems. By the first couple of minutes we get to see what type of person Gabriel is. She is clean, calm, kind hearted, and \"perfect,\" She'll live a perfect and healthy life when she enters Earth. Shewas able to do just that for a while...\\n\\n\r\nUntil...She runs out of mana...Thus begins the real story of Gabriel DropOut\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nProbably one of the strongest points in this whole entire series. For what seemed to be a perfect angel known as Gabriel, she decided to take a 90, no 180, no, 270 degree turn and completely changed herself. She is no longer Gabriel, but now..gabriel (with a lowercase G if u haven't noticed). She is lazy, she doesn't care, she uses shortcuts, she is flat, and she is a hard gamer. Therefore she is the \"0 shits\" character of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nVignette, probably the only character with common sense, and is not a complete well, dick? vagina? Let's just use mean fellah. Vignette keeps Gabriel in check, just remember, she is a demon. This demon is checking on the angel to make sure she doesn't do unnecessary acts to trouble her. Sounds just about right, right? Not right. A demon should not be the one watching her, more or less care about her actions. If anything, gabriel is the demon (since she does have a tainted halo) Vignette is more like an angel inside. When she tries to do evil acts, she does it in a way where it fails miserably, and makes it look damn adorable. Waifu Material? CHECK!\\n\\n\r\nSatania...Oh..poor Satania. Someone pls give her a hug. She will be the \"Punching Bag\" of this series. Satania is there for comic relief. She tries oh so hard to be evil, but it's too funny how stupid she tries. She's the character who you'll feel sorry for, but not sorry for, Because the amount of times people beat her, is to the point where you want to give her a nice hug. However I've got to be honest though, Satania has it where it counts. She has that bod. The only one that can compare is...\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel. Raph is probably HanaKana's most evil character this season. Even though she only has 3 roles this season (Continuing 3-gatsu, and Rewrite) Raphiel, well, Is a scummy character. Not the bad kind of scum, but the scum that'll make you love her even more. She is a completely sadistic but majestic character. She probably beats Satania in terms of body structure by a TAD bit. Raphiel is the true demon of the series. She will do everything in her power to make sure you suffer a horrible death. To make your life miserable. She can do it, with words... But you know who can make Satania suffer even more?\\n\\n\r\nDog. Dog is probably the best character in the show, his schemes are like no other. No one can match him, not even Raphiel. I dared to say that. The Dog and Satania have something, they share a certain bound. The master, and the slave, and I'm sure you can guess which one is which.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nLet's take a moment to appreciate yet another beautiful art style anime by Doga Kobo themselves. The character designs to the colour schemes, to the backgrounds, to the animation, to the attention in detail. It's got everything I wanted. It's a very colourful series that will give your eyes a nice rape. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\r\nThe voice acting, oh the voice acting. I need to meet them. They portray the emotion and personality of the character they play so well. Along with the OP and ED. With both of them being super catchy and something I would never skip. The way the music is done and the BGM during some of the scenes, that's what makes this anime so beautiful. Especially the sound effects gaw damn.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nMaybe this type of comedy series isn't for you, and that's ok. Everyone has a preferred way of what type of comedy sparks their trigger. It can be dark humour, crazy humour, whatever. But for me, the amount of times I've laughed and enjoyed Gabriel Dropout is beyond my own comprehension. To the characters, to the Music, to the Conversations, to the plot itself. This probably almost ties with Demi-chan for full enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nI've noticed that I've put a lot of 9's in my reviews. Since they're so close at bringing in my full satisfaction, but just isn't quite there. This anime does seem to focus on four girls, which I'm totally fine with. But this anime is for sure recommended for anyone who wants to:\\n\r\n1. Laugh\\n\r\n2. See someone bullied (in a comedic way of course)\\n\r\n3. See some hot bods.\\n\r\n4. Sit back and relax.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sitting back and relaxing might be hard. Considering it had me rolling on the floor most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nBUT PLEASE tell me I wasn't the only one who really felt sorry for Satania when she got fukked by the door.\\n\\n\r\nAt this current moment and time though. This is probably now my favourite comedy series, not just for this season. But favourite comedy series, ever.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut was successful in making me pee myself each episode.\\n\r\nEach episode was hilarious\\n\r\nEach episode are full of great memories.\\n\r\nEach episode takes your heart.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you don't think this series is funny, then I don't know what comedy is anymore.\\n\\n\r\nHappy laughing!",

Gabriel DropOut got me laughing and put a smile on face throughout each episode. I've finished this anime in about 4 days, and I would've finished it sooner but roadblocks, so you can tell how interested in Gabriel DropOut I was. The characters wereall cute, and just enjoyable. The art style was great, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same thing with the soundtrack, but the intro and the outro were really good. They were catchy and fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be interesting at first glance, but do watch this anime. You'll be laughing 'till you feel the pain in your tummy.",

            "content": "While I was looking for anime to binge watch for my summer break, I stumbled upon this show. When I first read the synopsis, I didn't expect much at all. It only looked like a comedy anime that revolved around cute girls doing cute things. However, I ended up watching Gabriel Dropout anyway since I had nothing else to do. That was a decision I don't regret making.\r\nStory - 6\r\nWell, the thing is, there is no actual story. \r\nIn the first episode, we are to introduced to the main character, Gabriel, who is graduating to become a full-fledged angel, and is apparently the top angelin their class. As a final test for all the future angels, they are to attend high school in the human world to closely observe humans. Many people placed their hopes and trust in Gabriel, telling her that they knew that she was going to go far and achieve a lot of heavenly things.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, Gabriel arrives at Earth as an angel in disguise, but when she gets exposed to the human entertainment that is video games, her personality does a full 180\u00b0 turn. Instead of helping people out, she now spends her time locked up in her apartment playing video games. Instead of calling herself an angel, she now calls herself a \"faillen\" angel.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tells the story of the wacky things that happens to Gabriel and her just as wacky companions in their everyday lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThere's nothing special or unique about the art and animation in this anime, in my opinion. I mean, I haven't really seen anything amazing from Doga Kobo, the animation studio for this, yet. We've seen something like this before, so there really isn't anything to gush about. Although, it does successfully manage to set the tone for the show and deliver the message, \"this is a comedy anime!\" to the viewers loud and clear. The art and animation does its job, and that's most important.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nTo be honest with you all, the only music I really paid attention to was the OP. I thought it was extremely charming in its own way. Go on and give the OP song a listen. What do you think about it? Yes, it's energetic. Yes, it's loud. But more importantly than that, it sounds like everyone singing is just having tons of fun. Heck, the lyrics make it seem like they aren't even singing at all! Read the English translation, it sounds like the four main characters are just having a normal conversation with each other. Honestly, I think this is genius and amazing. Sure, this may not be the first anime song to do this, but I really liked how did it in this OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, really. A huge part of why the comedy works is the excellent voice acting. If it weren't for that, then I think that the comedy wouldn't have such a strong effect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThe four main characters: Gabriel,Vigne, Raphiel, and Satania, are extremely lovable and really naturally funny.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Gabriel, the shut-in angel turned into \"faillen\" angel. Vigne, the demon in training that is more angelic than demonic. Raphiel, the angel who makes questionable decisions when it comes to having fun (most of which involve a certain \"archdemon\"). And Satania, the archdemon who is just a total airhead. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a single dull moment when these 4 are at the same place at the same time. The way they interact with each other is really entertaining, and, of course, funny. Call me immature if you don't appreciate this kind of humor, but I found everything really funny. I would constantly just smile and laugh like an idiot during every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved every single second I spent watching this show. All the jokes had me laughing out loud at every moment. I wish the anime never ended, sigh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a chill comedy anime to watch, then I recommend this show. You might like it, or you might not like it. It depends if the humor in this show is the kind of humor you actually like. It's a hit or miss kind of situation, really. I know people who thought the humor was too immature for their tastes. I just so happened to be the type who likes this kind of comedy. So, if you're anything like me, then you're sure to love this show just as much or even more than I do.",

            "content": "I honestly have no clue why the rating for this anime is so low. Guess ratings really don't matter, I've seen an anime rated around 8.7 and I enjoyed Gabriel Dropout way more than said anime. I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not I would even watch this anime, and I'm glad I eventually decided to. One factor as to why I eventually watched was because I wanted to understand memes with Satania in it- later on that in the Character section of my review...\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis I would give an 8, simply because in a lot of these 12-episode series there isn'treally a plot. Its more so just a jumble of events which don't really lead to one another in any way. I'm not against that, I just think to deserve anything higher than an 8 there has to exist some kind of flowing plot line which Gabriel Dropout didn't have.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the visuals were great. I like the way the expressions of Satania/Gabriel would change according to how they felt and in my opinion it added a lot in terms of humor. Also the characters are drawn very nicely and in a way it reflects their personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCatchy OP and ED, memorable and fitting to the tone of the anime. Didn't find myself ever skipping them which is always a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this was what made this anime so good. I initially watched this anime only because I saw lots of Satania memes and wondered, who the heck is this girl and why does everyone love her? Well I think I can now adequately answer that question. The characters in this anime are just so well made and they really drive  the humor in the story. Similar to anime like Konosuba (which I recommend too), lots of the laughing comes from just seeing them be together, seeing their personalities clash and mesh together. You have Gabriel who is literally the best actor in the world, hiding her sloth-like lifestyle behind a smile whenever she needs to. You have the responsible Vignette who deep down really cares about everyone but at the same time puts on almost a mother-like scolding face towards the group. You have Raphiel who I thought was the most interesting because she didn't really have one defining characteristic- I thought she would be mean at first because of how she mocked Satania, but at the same time she doesn't have purely mean intentions, they're just for fun. Finally, Satania who is pretty much the main source of humor for this anime. She's so dumb but at the same time embraces it to make it a comedic experience for everyone watching her. And its cool to see how Gabriel at first seems to hate her, but eventually grows warm to her and builds a strong bond with her, the same going for all her other companions.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters were exceptional and made every episode enjoyable. There was never a moment where I found myself wishing for an episode to end. In fact, I'm kind of sad its over now, because I found it so entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are on the edge about watching this anime, I really recommend it if you are looking to laugh. It's short anyways, so if you don't like the first few episodes simply drop it, because the rest of the anime doesn't really change. Yes, its a little cringey because there's literally no boys in this show and you are just watching a bunch of anime girls mess around, and I kept thinking to myself at first, \"why the hell am i even watching this?\" but in the end I don't regret it. Its a really unique kind of humor that I've never found watching any other show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nPS: Truth be told, I'm quite proud of my house blend. To attain my flavor and fragrance, I use five different types of coffee beans.",

            "content": "I wish I watched Gabriel Dropout sooner, because it was basically a comedy show. Each episode was full of laughs and although it got a bit more serious in the last few episodes, there were still scenes that were worthy of laughing at.\r\nIn terms of story there wasn't much in the way of story development the anime is more for the shits and giggles than the story IMO. In summary, the story revolves around Gabriel, Raphiel, Vignette and Satania and their interactions+struggles with the people around them and each other.\r\nAnimation wise is nothing too special. It's decent especially the animation of heaven and the characterdesign of the angels and demons. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is also quite decent I like the ending sounds pretty groovy.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of the anime is about the characters and how they grow or in the case of Gabriel, fall further and further into the abyss. A huge chunk of the anime goes into character development of Gabriel, Raphiel, Vignette and Satania which makes the audience feel connected to the 4 characters. There's Gabriel who's lazy though she does help her friends, Vignette who's caring and friendly who should be more of an angel than a demon, Raphiel who's gentle and nice but has a sadistic streak in her and Satania, who proclaims that she's the most evil demon but always end up failing in her attempts to be one. My favorite character in the anime is Raphiel she's damm hilarious to watch and is voiced by Kana Hanazawa who has a voice of an angel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if I had to rate the anime based on the 4 factors it'd be as follows:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.4/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 7.6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10",

            "content": "If I learned something from watching Gabriel DropOut, is that going to hell is definitely the superior option. Get ready for this hilarious comedy that reverses the roles of angels and demons!\r\nThe story is simple but interesting due to the comedic setting it creates: our protagonist, Gabriel, was a kind, top tier angel who always helped others. However, after coming to Earth she developed an addiction to online videogames and became incredibly lazy. From there we meet other angels and demon with personalities that don't fit the standards we give to them, creating lots of great comedic situations playing around that. Going back to Gabriel,I love how much of an asshole she can be to the others, it's a fun twist to the happy and kind main protagonist we usually have in these type of stories.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying that role instead, we have Vignette, an \u201cangelic demon\u201d if that makes sense. Being completely different to Gabriel, she is a very responsible and kind-hearted girl who is always there to help and bring happiness to everyone around her. How can a demon be this pure? No idea, but I can already tell you that she has some of the most heart-melting smiles that anime can provide. Next we have Satania, the cutest, most \u201cevil\u201d demon that exists. In order to conquer the Earth, she will do things as terrifying as refusing to do her homework or recycling a water bottle with the cap still on. I'm genuinely scared, I swear! As scary and powerful as she wants to be, she still miserably fails at everything and is the constant subject of bullying from Gabriel, and especially from Raphiel, that completes the main cast. Don't let her angelical looks fool you, she's a sadist that has teasing Satania as her favorite pastime. I have no idea what's going on in heaven to have girls like this as the most promising angels. \\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut has the biggest concentration of best girls I have seen in quite a good time, all of them are great and likeable, and the interactions between them are so fun to watch. It doesn\u2019t matter who you choose as your favorite, secondary characters like Tapris, an adorable angel that surprisingly behaves like an angel included, you are picking a great and lovable character.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design, backgrounds, and overall art style of this anime is well executed but nothing mindblowing. I felt that compared to other Doga Kobo works it didn't have as many impressively animated scenes as usual, however, the story itself doesn't really have that many moments for them to happen, and when there is the chance, they are done and look great, so I have no objections. In the sound department is mostly what I expected from a comedy anime, with songs that fit well with the tone, but aren't really that memorable. The same can't be said for both the opening (Gabriel Drop Kick) and the ending (Hallelujah\u2606Essaim) two great songs sung by the voice actors of our four main characters that are two personal favorites of this season. From the opening I especially love the part where the tone of the music adapts to whichever character is singing, using a calmer tone for the angels and a more intense one for the demons. The ending theme is mostly made by nice looking still shots together with the really catchy song.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gabriel DropOut is a very entertaining comedy anime that plays with the interesting idea of angels and demons and subverts your expectations of what their personalities should be like.   I personally had a blast watching it, really enjoying each episode and getting so attached to the characters over the course of the series. I can't see how an anime that made me look forward for the Mondays doesn't deserve to be a favorite of mine heh, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a nice comedy series to watch!\\n",

            "content": "My opinion:\r\nAt first glance, Gabriel Dropout seems nothing special and definitely does not stand out but it is actually a hilarious show that had me laughing till my stomach hurt.\r\nQuality wise Gabriel Dropout is not very good, it has a simple generic plot with some of the most stereotypical characters I have seen but that did not stop the show from being so damn entertaining.\r\nI\u2019ve decided to write this review in a more lively manner that better suits the show, doing so was fun.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nUpon passing a school in heaven, graduating angels are sent down to Earth with the duty to learn about and guidehumans towards the correct path in order to become full-fledged angels. Gabriel is the top angel in her class, dreaming about going to Earth and helping people but as soon as she actually arrives on Earth she becomes addicted to video games and turns into a complete slob as a result. The story follows Gabriel, along with other angels and demons who have descended to Earth, as they attend high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not complex or linear but rather simple with episodes presenting different stories that more often than not, do not relate to other episodes, but that doesn\u2019t stop the overall story from feeling fluid.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, demons often behave like little angels while angels behave like pseudo-demons, twist which I really liked. On one hand, we have the angel Gabriel saying she doesn\u2019t care about humans and joking about destroying humanity to cover up her \u201cpantie sighting\u201d, on the other hand, we have the demon, Vignette, who often cares for Gabriel, worries about other angels and even plays with children in the park. This \u201cchange of roles\u201d goes to show that what you are doesn\u2019t always describe or define the way you act.\\n\r\nFinally, the jokes. This show sells its humour very well with the main source of humour being the character chemistry, the interrelations of the characters are well-done and often result in hilarious situations that cracked me up. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, it is quite dumb to say angels are born like humans and that they live and behave like families, that\u2019s very far from the way it actually is but, what am I talking about? This is a comedy so I\u2019ll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe character cast is small yet effective, working well together and almost always perfectly delivering the jokes. The characters are more like antithesis of their archetype, with angels acting like demons and vice versa, which was quite a clever touch to the show\\n\r\nTo be honest, the cast of Gabriel Dropout consists of some of the most generic tropes I\u2019ve seen in anime but they work so well together and are so likable that it doesn\u2019t matter if they are generic or not.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel is an angel who was the top of her class but soon after her descent to Earth, she became addicted to video games and turned into a slob. She is often lazy and unmotivated and has a rather bossy attitude, which I could relate to since that is the way I was in highschool, like many other teenagers. An angel got corrupted by the human way of living, that is hilarious and also true, humans are social beings that will adapt to society and because angels are portrayed to be so much like humans, it is only natural that they would react like humans.\\n\\n\r\nVignette is the complete opposite of Gabriel, she is very responsible and often looks after Gabriel, contrary to her actual role as a demon. She often cooks and worries about others, she\u2019s an \u201cangelic demon\u201d to call it that. I find her character to be the best and the most intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nSatanichia, she\u2019s an egotistical demon who often thinks of weird ways to cause mischief which usually end in failure. She has no sense of taste and is often pestered by Raphiel and often falls victim to stray dogs. \\n\r\nIf I was to give Satanichia a role, it would be that of the failed villain because her \u201cdevious\u201d acts and plans often end up in failure due to her stupidity. I personally found her character a bit irritating but not bothersome.\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel is the second ranked angel in Gabriel's class, who has since become a sadistic stalker who takes delight in teasing Satanichia. I found her character hilarious due to her constant teasing of Satanichia which I could relate to, since I used to do the same to my friends but on a smaller scale.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation are lively and colorful, the characters\u2019 facial expressions are well done and fitting for the show. Aside from one beach episode, there wasn\u2019t much fan service, lack of fan service which I found great. Overall, the art and animation are good but nothing spectacular, it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nHaving a nice opening theme, a decent ending theme and a pretty good OST with the voice actors doing a good job interpreting the characters, I would say the overall sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I was laughing for the entire duration of the show, even though some jokes were overused I still found them funny, maybe because I was in the mood for a comedy show. Anyway, I highly enjoyed this show and I don\u2019t regret one second of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nA very good comedy show that stands out not because it has great quality production but because it is highly entertaining. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for a lighthearted show that will give you a good laugh, I recommend giving Gabriel Dropout a try.",

            "content": "Every now and then, I often go through a bucket list of things when deciding to pick up a new anime. Make no mistake, Gabriel Dropout\u2019s list consists of some of the most generic tropes you\u2019ll discover in anime. Does that automatically make the show unwatchable? Absolutely not. I mean, the show is like a soup with all sort of generic ingredients in it to bring out the flavor. However, it\u2019s a show that can also be a delight for fans who wants to see some colorful entertainment.\r\nOn the surface, the series doesn\u2019t really stand out much. It\u2019s essentially about angels and demons who havedescended to Earth to learn about humans and their life style. Main female protagonist Gabriel \u201cGab\u201d graduated at the top of her class but upon landing on Earth, she becomes a lazy hikikomori who is more interested in video games than anything else. It doesn\u2019t take long for viewers to understand what her character is like as the first episode establishes her role as pretty straightforward. The other characters also take little time to make their way into the story as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs a slice of life story, there\u2019s not much linear storyline or complex plot going on. Every episode consists of segments that makes up for its storytelling. In fact, most episodes can consist of multiple storytelling segments with little relations to another. However, what makes this show special is the character cast. It\u2019s a small yet effective character cast that consists of Gab, Vigne, Satania, and Raphiel. Gab and Raphiel are the angels while Satania and Vigne are the demons. Contrary to what viewers may expect, these characters are more like antithesis of their archetype. Gab hardly has an angelic personality but is instead portrayed with a lazy and spoiled attitude. Satania is pretty much a harmless villain as her devious behavior is often overshadowed by her own idiocy. The idea is that these characters all came to Earth to adapt with society. Yet, they have their own motives that is satirized by comedy. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the humor of this show plays a big role to fulfill enjoyment. Like most comedy/slice of life stories, it tries to sell its humor and does it quite well. The most effective way it does so is with the character chemistry. With such a small cast of characters, we can easily see how their relationships are without overthinking it. Take Satania and Raphiel for instance. Raphiel often teases Satania while the latter tries to cause mischief with hilarious results. On the other hand, Satania always tries to \u201ccompete\u201d with Gab but somehow falls short for whatever reason that comes up. Vigne stands at the middle ground as she a more mature character yet also has her own outrageous moments. That being said, the show also introduces some lesser impactful characters that spice up the character chemistry. One of the more noticeable characters though is Tap, an angel that adds her own bits of magic into this show. In retrospect, the key success to these characters isn\u2019t how their roles are portrayed but rather how they bring the show\u2019s humor to life.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, the adaptation is faithful but doesn\u2019t follow every chapter in a linear order. I can also say with disappointment that there were some chapters that should have been adapted. As a standard 1-cour show of 12 episodes, it\u2019s not all too surprising. In the meantime, the humor can be a hit or miss for some fans. Its attempt to sell comedy will not meet everyone\u2019s standards and from the first episode, it can be the deciding factor of keep or drop. Finally, I have to admit that Gabriel Dropout lacks character development. There\u2019s not much change to any of the main characters while we don\u2019t learn much background story about them either. While some could say that slice of life stories like this doesn\u2019t need them, it can still be disheartening for fans who are more interested in those elements.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Doga Kobo, the show is quite colorful. Literally, every character stands out in some way from their different hair colors and their extra accessories. (Gab\u2019s halo, Satania\u2019s devil-like hair piece, Raphiel\u2019s crosses, etc) Production quality is also simple yet effective to bring out the gimmicks. There\u2019s not much fan service (although there\u2019s a beach episode) so expect more or less comedy as the series\u2019 main way of servicing the fans. The character expressions also works quite well to supplement with the show\u2019s humor.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack isn\u2019t all too impressive although it gets down the idea right for its OP and ED theme songs. What should feel impressive is the character voice mannerisms. They fit them so well. Gab\u2019s voice really makes her sound like a lazy sloth while Satania\u2019s devilish laughs gives her the impressions of a devil. By the time I finished watching Gabriel Dropout, I felt like the character voices really outdid themselves.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Gabriel Dropout? It sounds like a tough question but really has a simple answer. If you fancy comedy without relevancy with its storytelling, then this is the show for you. It has humorous gags and characters shine with their personalities. However, if you\u2019re more into something serious or development in storytelling, then look elsewhere. For me, this series has the virtue of being funnier than what it looks like. Now that\u2019s a certain kind of fun.\\n",

            "content": "Doga Kobo might not be the absolute biggest name in the anime industry but if there is one thing they have truly made a name for themselves for, then it is their aptitude at making moe comedies. With an repertoire including the likes of Himouto Umaru-chan, New Game and of course the legendary Yuru Yuri among others, this is truly the studio's specialty. Adding to this lineup, this season we now have Gabriel DropOut, which once again showcases just how to make this genre shine at its very brightest.\r\nGabriel DropOut can briefly be described as role-reversed angels and demons turned moe. The story mainly followstwo angels and two demons, who all end up moving from Heaven and Hell respectively to the human world upon starting high school. The catch is that the angels in question are a lot less admirable than you might expect, whereas the demons are not particularly evil. It is a simple twist on paper, but it ends up working to great comedic effect more often than not in this rather mean-spirited comedy show.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the nature of the anime, it is unsurprisingly largely character-driven. First of all there is the show's supposed main character Gabriel, named after the archangel. She is someone who used to be a picture-perfect angel with the most pristine, beautiful smile whose sole intention was to spread as much happiness as possible in the human world. That is until she one day randomly ends up playing an MMO as a healer in order to help the other players (how the game ended up on her laptop in the first place is never explained but whatever), only to find that people were dying when she ran out of mana, causing her to purchase an exclusive premium healing staff for real money in desperation. And this turns to be the starting point of Gabriel quickly going down a slippery slope until she eventually becomes a self-centered game addict and a hikikomori. In other words, basically a lost cause and in this case a fallen angel. She is rather reminiscent of Doma Umaru from Himouto Umaru-chan in this sense, but Gabriel is even more hopeless since unlike Umaru she 1) does not put in any effort in school or try to keep up appearances either, and 2) fully embraces the NEET lifestyle and does not even try to improve herself whatsoever, much to the dismay of her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, her best friend is Vigne (who I think is supposed to represent the demon Vine but I am not sure), a very diligent and kind-hearted demon who only wants to help people. Her devotion manages to get Gabriel to at least get out of her room and attend school sometimes, but unfortunately that is not the way demons are supposed to behave, and thus she sometimes finds herself in just as much trouble as Gabriel regarding lack of financial support from back home. The poor girl just cannot find it in herself to be evil as much as it is expected from someone in her position.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone who most definitely wants to be as evil as possible though is the so-called \"future queen of hell\" Satanichia\u2014more commonly known as Satania\u2014which is quite obviously a feminized version of Satan. She is perhaps the real star of this show as most of its funniest gags revolve around her... or rather her misfortune. Put simply, Satania is an idiot, and her attempts at being evil always end in complete failure. Also, the other girls are generally pretty mean to her in return for all the nuisances she creates. This is undoubtedly the most mean-spirited part of the show as Satania is most often treated as the butt of everyone else's jokes, but it works out surprisingly well because of the light-hearted nature of it all (and let us be honest here, quite a lot of the abuse she is given is well deserved).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough pretty much everyone has a piece of Satania every now and then, the main culprit behind Satania's torment however is the fourth and final of our main characters: Raphiel (named after the archangel Raphael). She is a former classmate of Gabriel's from their days up in Heaven, and whilst she may look like a model honor student at a glance, she is actually both a sadist and a huge troll whose favorite pastime is manipulating and toying with Satania in various ways. As she already proved in Prison School, HanaKana is surprisingly adept at voice acting sadistic girls, and the case with Raphiel's character is no different.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much in the way of actual plot progression throughout the show. There are a couple backstory segments showcasing how Gabriel and Vigne first met, and in some of the latter episodes we also get to see some more glimpses of what Heaven and Hell look like when the girls temporarily go back home on vacation, which also lets us meet their families. Beyond that though, the show mostly consists of standalone skits (usually like four segments per episode or so), however that is totally fine because this is purely a comedy show at heart, and quite a lot of the time it is actually legitimately hilarious. I cannot actually label it as the comedy of the season for the simple reason that KonoSuba 2 happened to be airing simultaneously, but during any normal circumstances it certainly would be. Granted, humour is very subjective so I cannot promise anything, but at the very least I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut is not a complicated series, but it executes its own premise excellently and delivers a consistently enjoyable and momentarily hilarious experience. Combined with Doga Kobo's typical clean and shiny moe art style (and a fantastic ED I might add), it all amounts to one of the best moe comedies I have seen in quite some time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: For whatever reason, Crunchyroll's subtitles for this anime are absolutely cringeworthy. In what universe does \"Itadakimasu~\" translate to \"Through the Dark Lord Amen\" if I may ask? Keep your 4chan memes away from my subs please, because if you think you are being funny I am sorry to disappoint you. Hopefully some fansub group will pick this show up and retranslate it from scratch sometime in the near future so that it might actually be bearable to read.",

            "content": "There are two ways I look at Gabriel DropOut. One is as a CGDCT anime and the other is as a comedy. While the two usually go very well together I separate the two of them for a reason. As a CGDCT anime Gabriel DropOut is alright. Vinge and Satania are cute, and at least Gabriel has a cute design, even if her personality is annoying. However, as a comedy anime it is painful.\r\nThe biggest issue I have with Gabriel DropOut is that it's not funny. Many of the jokes all boil down to the same thing: \"The angels act like demons and the demonsact like angels.\" That's actually an interesting idea but the problem is it's not very funny. And it's certainly not funny enough to fill up 12 episodes. However, still the show likes to repeat this joke over and over and over and over again. That and Satania bullying (having funny mean things happen to Satania) is the bread and butter that this show has. Both of which got boring pretty quickly. They do sometimes mix in other jokes but even those jokes fall flat most of the time because it's predictable how they end up. Some of them are jokes I've seen from other shows in the past. The execution of these shows as well tends to be lackluster. There isn't enough variation in the setup or the punchline of the joke so it only adds to that samey feeling. Comedy is subjective but I have a hard time understanding what's so funny about this show. Rather it's attempts at humor usually annoy me more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters range from good to incredibly grating. As it turns out the demons fall into the former camp while the angels fall into the latter camp. Satania is dumb but can be pleasant to watch due to her attitude and the life she brings to the show. Vigne is basically a normal girl as a demon so like a normal girl, she's cute as well. I wouldn't consider either of the characters very well developed as the show never really pulls them apart from their normal behaviour or gets them into situations where they have to grow. There was a moment with Vigne where she showed some more depth but for the most part, the show lacks in that department. That said the two demons are fine characters and at least are likeable. The issue with these two is that it depends on who they're paired up with for how enjoyable each segment is. They're usually paired with the angels which sadly doesn't help them out.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel is a whole mess of issues. First off she's basically an okatu character played straight. She's never more interesting than that, and her cynicism and her lack of caring get really annoying to watch. It's even more so annoying when they make up this backstory of her being a perfect little angel before getting tainted by the modern world and video games. That actually could have been an interesting story if Gabriel cared about retaining her angelic nature and if it happened slowly through time. Instead, it takes one night, throwing out all illusion of having character development or depth in exchange for a cheap laugh that isn't even funny. What's worse than her bland and uninteresting personality is that there's nothing that makes her likeable. She usually ends up acting pretty mean to her friends, which only serves to make her character less likeable. Thusly. I have no reason to want to see her on the screen nor care about her well-being. It even hurts her cuteness because she has a great design yet it's hard to really adorable or enjoy the looks of someone who I don't like. The ruins part of the magic that could be there.\\n\\n\r\nRaphael is a sadist, and if she had any redeemable traits that'd be ok. But she doesn't. Rather she's pretty much a sadist and nothing else. Her target of prey is poor Satania. Sometimes this works well and is funny but most of the time it doesn't. Satania bullying only really works when Satania is being played due to her own faults. Otherwise, it's cruel and seems unfair for poor Satania. What did she do to deserve being bullied? She has her flaws but not enough to justify the amount of bullying she receives in the show. I personally have a problem with characters getting mistreated whether by the world or by other characters and since it ends up happening so often it only adds to the annoyance that this show can provide. But going back to Raphael, that is the main point of interest with her, and probably the only notable one. And like Gabriel, she gives no reason to like her, and thusly she's annoying to have to watch, as well as again being a bland character. \\n\\n\r\nUnlikeable characters are fine when there is a purpose behind them. Say if they are villains, or if they're used well for comedy. However, the comedy gotten from these characters are stale and not worth while. Furthermore, they clash against the notion of caring about the girls which hurts the CGDCT aspect of the show. The show doesn't work that well all together, and the root of the cause is its failed comedy. Thusly, I imagine how one feels about Gabriel DropOut depends on how funny one finds it. If one finds it funny then it's some of these problems feel like less of an issue. But personally I didn't, and thusly I relied on the characters to win me over. While Vinge and Satania worked, the angels did not, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Gabriel DropOut's poor attempts at humor there were a couple of episodes that did shine. These episodes proved that the show can throw in some good material when it wants to. There is a later character that appears named Tapris who is proof of this. However, the show spends more time mulling around the same jokes to really go anywhere and that's it's loss. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were solid throughout but never seemed notable enough to give it praise. The music was ok, although I don't really care for the OP very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is inconsistent and has issues with its humor and its characters, however, it is pretty cute and does have some merits. This is a show that you can probably tell whether you'll like it or not from the first couple of episodes. They never really move on from that type of material. Personally, I don't recommend it but there are worse shows to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAn unimportant note: The CR subs for this show were absolute trash. They kept on inserting random jokes instead of translating the actual line. Although that's CR's fault not Gabriel DropOut's fault.",

            "content": "An angel and demon comedy, I've definitely seen something similar to this before... *eyes hataraku maou-sama*\r\nLet me start by saying that this anime was a lot better than I thought it would be. Normally, I like to wait for anime to finish airing before I watch them, but this season I wanted to try something different - so I chose something I thought would be average. So far, this anime seems to be pure comedy with no plot to be seen - just four cute girls living their lives on Earth, doing cute things.\r\nHowever, even without a plot, it's not at all boring nor averagelike I had assumed it would be.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very silly slice of life and the past 4 episodes have been really enjoyable. It's nothing outstanding, but definitely something that will keep you excited when the next episode comes out. The OP and ED are also very pleasing and impossible to skip over (at least in my opinion), they give that familiar vibe that gets you excited for what's next to come in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very likeable, funny and their character designs are simple but still stand out. The roles of angels and demons have switched; the demons are pure while the angels are immoral/careless. Our first angel and the main protagonist, Gabriel, was once a hardworking student and is now a lazy shut-in who skips school and couldn't care less about anything other than her MMO's. Raphiel, the 2nd angel, happens to be a very mischievious character who slyly portrays herself as the nice girl. And the last two demons are Vignette: a very mature demon, and Satania: a demon who tries too hard to be evil but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed anime like New Game, K-ON, Love Live!, then you might enjoy this as it has cute girls doing cute things, BUT the main thing that differentiates them from Gabriel DropOut is that they have ambitions while GD does not, but instead offers only a cute comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is nothing new and original, but it does a good job with what it has. Overall, I would recommend to give this anime a shot! It'll be worth it, and you might even receive a new favorite character.\\n\\n\r\n***might be updated***\\n\\n",

            "content": "-PREVIEW-\r\nStarting of the year 2017, we have Gabriel DropOut! A slice of life and comedy series about the everyday lives of 4 cute girls [Heaven and Hell] living in human world after graduating from their respective 'schools'. There's a lot more SOL, CGDCT anime aired this season.\r\nGabriel DropOut to me is quite interesting to watch. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime clich\u00e9 as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girlsdoing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off. Making the anime series, to be linear or in par with the manga I've started reading before this series is even aired. A plus of it, would be the comedic scenes by the characters in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, handled by Doga Kobo which their animations are nicely done and the use of manga iconography is there to express the characters emotions. Most of their background areas and the city scenes are the Doga Kobo standards, which I've seen already a lot in which Doga Kobo produced such as Himouto Umaru Chan. Nevertheless, I still enjoy the series from Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP song by far is the best song for Winter 2017 in my perspective, due to it's vocals mixing both the angelic voice and heavy rock voice together which makes a fantastic OP song to hear, I've would even repeat this song every time. Most of the OST songs are very decent and has a very quite familiar tone to that Umaru Chan, in which most of the staffs who produced this Anime is from Umaru chan.  Most of the seiyuus are pretty new, well we do have Hanazawa Kana who voiced Raphi. However, all the seiyuus are doing fantastically well in their debuts.\\n\\n\r\nI'll talk more about the characters once I've released the full review. However, SATANIA-CHAN IS THE BEST GIRL FTW!\\n\\n\r\nAfter the first four episodes were aired, I really enjoyed watching Gabriel DropOut not only due to having the same staff from Umaru Chan, but the comedies and the gags that this series had produced that made everyone laugh and making the series more enjoyable then ever. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, enjoy watching Gabriel DropOut! I definitely would recommend this anime to those who are slice of life/CGDCT lovers out there.",

            "content": "Gabriel Dropout was genuninly a nice surprise for me. Coming into this show with hardly any expectations whatsoever, I left feeling satisfied with a fun show with good comedy and a cast of characters that I actually liked by the end. This show doesn't do anything remarkable in terms of its narrative or characters but it remains a fun ride throughout, and the characters are both enjoyable enough, and their chemistry between each other feels natural enough to carry the weight of the show.\r\nGabriel Dropout is about a fallen angel named Gabriel, who visits Earth originally as a means of learning more about Earth culture(but only visits Japan to achieve this, ignoring all of the other hundreds of cultures but, hey whatever), but, as she becomes addicted to the world of online gaming, she falls into depravity, changing from a sweet, kind \"butter wouldn't melt\" type character to the lazy, self-centred lie about. During the duration of the show, she meets new demons and reunites with old angel friends who have yet fallen and have come to Earth to learn more about its culture and customs. And that's pretty much it for the narrative. The rest of the show involves the characters in random situations and scenarios, that gets funnier as the show goes along. It took a little while for me to warm up to the show, I think the first three episodes, while still being fine, were not as interesting overall as the latter. When the characters had all been introduced, I was having much more fun with the show overall, mainly due to how fun all of the characters are in this series. While the individual archetypes for the characters had been done before, each one bounces off of each other rather effectively and there is a good enough variety in jokes (for the most part that is) to carry the comedy. There were a few moments in which the comedy was a little TOO stupid for my taste, such as when Satania takes the dog and travels all the way to a far off land; my main problem is that the joke went on for too long. Similarly, there were also some jokes that I felt were either unfunny or kind of fell flat on their face, but these moments didn't take too much away from the show to the point where it ruined it for me and these moments were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is also interesting as a dynamic is that two of the character's archetypes, that being an angel and a demon, are switched around, and while I wouldn't go as far as to call this a subversion of themes or anything, this addition still adds another layer onto the comedy of the show. In terms of characters, there are four central ones; two demons and two angels. Gabriel, as previously mentioned, is the fallen angel who spends the majority of her time playing games and just generally being a worthless member of society. She has her share of funny lines and personality traits, but most jokes with her are just about her lifestyle. Granted, as the series went on, the comedy with her became more funnier, as a result of the more expressive reactions the voice actress and the animators could muster. Vignette, was also a fun character who plays the straight man, or straight woman in this case and despite being a demon, she is perhaps one of the kindest and sweetest people ever. We have Raphiel, another angel who spends most of the time laughing at the expense of the other characters or laughing at Satania, who, in my eyes is the best character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSatania is essentially a wannabe arch demon who thinks she is evil as all hell, but her attempts at being evil come down to her announcing that she hasn't done her homework boldly in class or starting a fight over a dog who keeps stealing her melon bread. She is delightful and fun to watch, as she attempts all of these various \"evil\" plots and schemes which always amount to her getting the short end of the stick in the end. There are other characters, such as Gabriel's older sister who makes an appearance in the final episode and is charming in her own way but for the main crust of the show, it focuses on these four, which isn't so bad considering how fun they all are. The show just needed a little more variety in order to bump the score up a little more higher. In terms of animation, the show has a very bright colour pallet and the animation, particularly in the final episode is great. It was produced by the same people who made New Game last year, which also had very attractive looking character designs and animation. The soundtrack was also pretty good, and held together pretty well, but is pretty forgettable aside from the opening and ending tracks which are fun and fit the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gabriel Dropout is a fun show with fun characters and I do recommend it to anyone looking for something easy and fun to each whilst delivering entertainment.\\n\\n",

Anything...\r\nIn my first attempt to watch this series, i only managed to bear 2 episodes and i just wanted to drop it instantly. This is my general routine on every series i watch.. I always watch the first two episodes and analize the sample. If i get bored of it, i simply drop it. But for the first time i thought, maybe i was being way too harsh with this procedure.\r\nI have no clue how didi make it through all that episodes. But i did it somehow.\\n\\n\r\nI was pretty much right. The biggest thing this gets from me is \"bleh\". You watch it, you waste your time for pretty much nothing. Characters are pretty much uninteresting, unoriginal and stereotypical; jokes are bunch of anime tropes, \"lol so random\" or/and just plain forced (harhar doggy stole mah bread, is it funny yet guys?).\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes it has a \"beach episode\" as well, what a surprise. So just another generic anime you'll forget few months later.",

Before watching it I was a bit undecided about the animation, I thought it could fail, but finally, I gave it an opportunity. \r\nThe story is very simple; an angel gets corrupt with the human entertain methods in this case video games. The angel change of mind and become a fallen angel that doesn't care about anything, is lazy, sometimes annoying but is fun to watch. The angel meets certain demons that become her friends. \r\nThis simple story has some holes. There are parts unconcluded, unexplained but is the same with the manga. The idea of astory is based on short arcs that change from episode to episode. These arcs are defined by moments of their lives such us school life, vacations, illness, etc. The jokes sometimes are very silly but in general, are well executed, and with the progression of the characters you will enjoy them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the best part of the animation. Each character has they distinct personality that is a complement between all them. They aren't angelical, and they aren't evil. They are just friends that try to understand the world in their way. The character art is very colorful and blends very well with the moment of the story and the actions of the scenes, After seeing the episodes when a character isn't there you will miss it. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs are good, so far there are only three, but they are funny, and the sound was good for this animation. In general, this animation was good, funny and wasn't annoying. You should give it an opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if there is going to be a second season, the manga is being published and will take time to have enough stories for it, but if there is a second season I will be watching it. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What happens when you mix Himouto! Umaru-chan with angels and demons? Tenshi! Gabriel-chan. Witness main character Gabriel Tenma White\u2019s fall from grace towards the clutches of one of humanity\u2019s greatest evils: massively multiplayer online games! Gabriel DropOut is a fun, charming Slice of Life that follows the lives of two angels and two demons as they engage themselves in the bizarre world of mortal delights.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy series title if you\u2026\r\n-- generally enjoy Slice of Life anime with a medium sized group of main characters\r\n-- consider yourself interested by the implementation of \u201cangels\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d\r\n-- enjoyed the concept and progression of itscousin in Himouto! Umaru-chan\\n\\n\r\nYou may not enjoy series title if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- often stray from the particular genres with which the series is assocaited\\n\r\n-- seek a plot with deeper thematic substance\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nAll of Heaven\u2019s upcoming angels must take a period of study on Earth to live and learn among their mortal inferiors as requirement for advancement. Gabriel Tenma White, valedictorian of her graduating class, proves one of the most promising angels of the time, that is, until she became corrupted by human living. Thanks to the addicting nature of MMOs, she found herself drawn to lifestyle of a hikikomori, becoming what she proudly refers to as a \u2018faillen angel\u2019. Her friend, kindly demon Vignette Tsukinose April, does what she can to help Gabriel get on the right track, yet to no avail. With the sadistic Raphiel and delusional Satania along for the journey, these four supernatural teens come to learn the lines that separates angel, demon, and human are easily blurred.\\n\\n\r\nAs we follow the daily lives of the four, the main attention point is how contrary they act to how you\u2019d expect. Gabriel, an angel formerly top of her class, has devolved into an unreliable, lazy shut-in. Vignette, a demon straight from Hell, manages to be a responsible, caring, and otherwise altruistic friend. Raphiel is devilish in her own right, developing all sorts of pranks and such for Satania, self-proclaimed \u201cfuture archdemon\u201d and the one character who at least tries to act like she should, though usually to her own dismay (and our enjoyment). Scenes generally concern themselves with character interactions, and with the great characters that we receive, most of them are fun and generally humorous.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s a set lore in place, most of the series concerns itself with the daily events in the lives of the girls, effectively branding the anime a Slice of Life. Unfortunately, an issue that seems to place most in this genre is the very predictable episodic structure. As usual, yes there are holiday episodes, along with a beach journey earlier on. How badly (or positively?) the formulaic approach affects your experience will differ from person to person, and it\u2019s not too big of a deal for me. There\u2019s also a few fanservice-y scenes, though nothing too prevalent. Enough to please those who enjoy it and respect those that don\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a comedy anime, and I actually found it to be pretty hilarious at times. Comedy in Slice of Lives, particularly, are subjective, so not everyone is going to get the same enjoyment out of it. I can tell you that if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, I wouldn\u2019t bother watching, as that\u2019s its primary selling point aside from character relationships. There are a few recurring gags that are generally funny and mostly revolve Satania getting screwed over, though at times they can get a bit repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, it would have been very easy for the creators to just add the fact there are \u201cangels\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d as a selling point, but I have to say the fact they weren\u2019t humans really did help give the series more substance. A lot of the actions and dialogue relied on the interrelationships between angels and demons or those beings and humans, which in turn also helped support the comedy. In the latter half of the series, there were a couple episodes that involved the four returning to their respective realms in Heaven or Hell, presenting some really fun scenes from both zones.\\n\\n\r\nWorth mentioning too is that, perhaps as a complement to the rising trend of hikikomori in Japan, the main character exhibits many traits usually absent from a protagonist in her laziness, social withdrawal, and general apathy. With other protagonists similar to this in Kazuma Satou of Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! and Umaru Doma of Himouto! Umaru-chan, it\u2019s becoming more prevalent that Japan is attracting this particular audience in their future creative works. If this is a sort of archetype you enjoy, you\u2019ll find yourself pleased with Gabriel overall, but take note that she does take it a bit further and act like a bit of an asshole at times, explained better later on.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with Himouto! Umaru-chan, you\u2019ll come to find out the animation is strikingly similar, especially in terms of facial representation, background animation, and scenery. Both were animated by studio Doga Kobo, which I can say does a satisfactory job overall. Slice of Life anime rarely go above and beyond in terms of visual technique, but Gabriel DropOut performs well by enacting bright, exciting visuals with lively characters, however there are often cases of \u201cresting same face\u201d that don\u2019t detract too heavily from its overall aesthetic. That being said, I always have a soft spot for when characters have striking color palettes, and each of the four girls have one, so good job.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t say I was too impressed with the music. This is by no means saying it wasn\u2019t acceptable, rather it\u2019s that standard, generic Slice of Life soundtrack you\u2019d expect to hear on almost any series within the genre. A few episodes had some good moments, notably those involving the coffee shop, but otherwise you won\u2019t be looking to buy the discs.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu performed their roles very well, with no complaints with any performance. Two VAs did stand out well, particularly with Miyu Tomita nailing Gabriel\u2019s monotone, even bored attitude and Naomi Oozora really seeming to understand the character of Satania, with her air of self-importance captured in detail.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the otherwise underwhelming soundtrack, I did enjoy both the opening and ending themes, both of which were performed by the characters themselves (always a welcome benefit).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAs any good Slice of Life anime will require, the characters within Gabriel DropOut are unique, entertaining, and otherwise lovable. While Gabriel serves as the primary character, Vignette, Satania, and Raphiel receive ample amounts of attention, allowing fans of either or all to be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel Tenma White, our titular \u201cfaillen angel\u201d, has made radical changes since her visit to the human world. Thanks to the intoxicating nature of video games, she has forsaken any sort of altruistic goals her previous self may have set, focusing only on living her life as a hikikomori. Due to her apathetic nature, she often comes off as a bit of an asshole, though she does have her moments where she lets her true feelings for her friends pour out.\\n\\n\r\nVignette Tsukinose April is perhaps the strongest character in her stability and attitude. She functions quite strongly as Gabriel\u2019s foil, always trying to help her friend get focused back on her duties as an angel, though she herself seems to act the most angelic of the four. Despite this, she tries her hardest to prove she can be a true demon, but no one is really convinced.\\n\\n\r\nSatanichia Kurumizawa McDowell is easily the most enjoyable character of the series, and the one from whom much of the comedy originates. Though dim-witted and unintimidating, she has delusions of grandeur in that she will become the future archdemon of Hell. Originally the self-proclaimed rival of Gabriel, she comes to befriend the angel as she had no friends otherwise. There\u2019s also a little doggo that comes and steals her melon bread at every opportunity, what a dick!\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel Ainsworth Shiraha is a sneaky little devil, no pun intended, and thrives in the misfortune of her companion, Satania. Large-busted and sadistic, a lot of the comedy also comes from Raphiel, as her pranks, not only on Satania but Vignette too.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other characters introduced, including Tapris (Gabriel\u2019s easily fooled kohai), Machiko (class president), and the unnamed coffee shop owner (Gabriel\u2019s boss and coffee lover), though none of them have particularly large roles outside of being relevant to a given episode\u2019s plot (or subplot).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut is best described as one of those series that doesn\u2019t quite earn the sticking power of a great one but leaves you feeling satisfied and content with your time spent following its conclusion. Much of this is attributed to the fact that it felt very formulaic in its Slice of Life plot progression, though it performs well in offering four lovable characters whose interactions entertain you from episode to episode. These types of anime are not for everyone, and you can pretty much tell whether or not you\u2019d enjoy it from a quick glance, but those that do will find themselves pleased with what\u2019s offered.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cLike,  humanity can just go to Hell and die for all I care.\u201d \u2013 Gabriel",

            "content": "If an angel came down to earth to live like a human being, what would they act like. What kind of lifestyle will they pursue? Well in this anime. It can go in many directions. Ladies and Gentlemen one of my personal favourite comedies, Gabriel DropOut.\r\n I will be reviewing the episodes as an anime-only watcher.\r\nStory (9)\r\nMeet Gabriel, the oh so perfect angel that will solve all the problems. By the first couple of minutes we get to see what type of person Gabriel is. She is clean, calm, kind hearted, and \"perfect,\" She'll live a perfect and healthy life when she enters Earth. Shewas able to do just that for a while...\\n\\n\r\nUntil...She runs out of mana...Thus begins the real story of Gabriel DropOut\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nProbably one of the strongest points in this whole entire series. For what seemed to be a perfect angel known as Gabriel, she decided to take a 90, no 180, no, 270 degree turn and completely changed herself. She is no longer Gabriel, but now..gabriel (with a lowercase G if u haven't noticed). She is lazy, she doesn't care, she uses shortcuts, she is flat, and she is a hard gamer. Therefore she is the \"0 shits\" character of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nVignette, probably the only character with common sense, and is not a complete well, dick? vagina? Let's just use mean fellah. Vignette keeps Gabriel in check, just remember, she is a demon. This demon is checking on the angel to make sure she doesn't do unnecessary acts to trouble her. Sounds just about right, right? Not right. A demon should not be the one watching her, more or less care about her actions. If anything, gabriel is the demon (since she does have a tainted halo) Vignette is more like an angel inside. When she tries to do evil acts, she does it in a way where it fails miserably, and makes it look damn adorable. Waifu Material? CHECK!\\n\\n\r\nSatania...Oh..poor Satania. Someone pls give her a hug. She will be the \"Punching Bag\" of this series. Satania is there for comic relief. She tries oh so hard to be evil, but it's too funny how stupid she tries. She's the character who you'll feel sorry for, but not sorry for, Because the amount of times people beat her, is to the point where you want to give her a nice hug. However I've got to be honest though, Satania has it where it counts. She has that bod. The only one that can compare is...\\n\\n\r\nRaphiel. Raph is probably HanaKana's most evil character this season. Even though she only has 3 roles this season (Continuing 3-gatsu, and Rewrite) Raphiel, well, Is a scummy character. Not the bad kind of scum, but the scum that'll make you love her even more. She is a completely sadistic but majestic character. She probably beats Satania in terms of body structure by a TAD bit. Raphiel is the true demon of the series. She will do everything in her power to make sure you suffer a horrible death. To make your life miserable. She can do it, with words... But you know who can make Satania suffer even more?\\n\\n\r\nDog. Dog is probably the best character in the show, his schemes are like no other. No one can match him, not even Raphiel. I dared to say that. The Dog and Satania have something, they share a certain bound. The master, and the slave, and I'm sure you can guess which one is which.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\r\nLet's take a moment to appreciate yet another beautiful art style anime by Doga Kobo themselves. The character designs to the colour schemes, to the backgrounds, to the animation, to the attention in detail. It's got everything I wanted. It's a very colourful series that will give your eyes a nice rape. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\r\nThe voice acting, oh the voice acting. I need to meet them. They portray the emotion and personality of the character they play so well. Along with the OP and ED. With both of them being super catchy and something I would never skip. The way the music is done and the BGM during some of the scenes, that's what makes this anime so beautiful. Especially the sound effects gaw damn.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\r\nMaybe this type of comedy series isn't for you, and that's ok. Everyone has a preferred way of what type of comedy sparks their trigger. It can be dark humour, crazy humour, whatever. But for me, the amount of times I've laughed and enjoyed Gabriel Dropout is beyond my own comprehension. To the characters, to the Music, to the Conversations, to the plot itself. This probably almost ties with Demi-chan for full enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\r\nI've noticed that I've put a lot of 9's in my reviews. Since they're so close at bringing in my full satisfaction, but just isn't quite there. This anime does seem to focus on four girls, which I'm totally fine with. But this anime is for sure recommended for anyone who wants to:\\n\r\n1. Laugh\\n\r\n2. See someone bullied (in a comedic way of course)\\n\r\n3. See some hot bods.\\n\r\n4. Sit back and relax.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sitting back and relaxing might be hard. Considering it had me rolling on the floor most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nBUT PLEASE tell me I wasn't the only one who really felt sorry for Satania when she got fukked by the door.\\n\\n\r\nAt this current moment and time though. This is probably now my favourite comedy series, not just for this season. But favourite comedy series, ever.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut was successful in making me pee myself each episode.\\n\r\nEach episode was hilarious\\n\r\nEach episode are full of great memories.\\n\r\nEach episode takes your heart.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you don't think this series is funny, then I don't know what comedy is anymore.\\n\\n\r\nHappy laughing!",

Now I'm not a very good reviewer so...\r\nThis is the type of anime that was focused on entertainment more than the story. If you're the more of the story guy, well uh, this might not be for you. Gabriel DropOut got me laughing and put a smile on face throughout each episode. I've finished this anime in about 4 days, and I would've finished it sooner but roadblocks, so you can tell how interested in Gabriel DropOut I was. The characters wereall cute, and just enjoyable. The art style was great, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same thing with the soundtrack, but the intro and the outro were really good. They were catchy and fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be interesting at first glance, but do watch this anime. You'll be laughing 'till you feel the pain in your tummy.",

            "content": "While I was looking for anime to binge watch for my summer break, I stumbled upon this show. When I first read the synopsis, I didn't expect much at all. It only looked like a comedy anime that revolved around cute girls doing cute things. However, I ended up watching Gabriel Dropout anyway since I had nothing else to do. That was a decision I don't regret making.\r\nStory - 6\r\nWell, the thing is, there is no actual story. \r\nIn the first episode, we are to introduced to the main character, Gabriel, who is graduating to become a full-fledged angel, and is apparently the top angelin their class. As a final test for all the future angels, they are to attend high school in the human world to closely observe humans. Many people placed their hopes and trust in Gabriel, telling her that they knew that she was going to go far and achieve a lot of heavenly things.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, Gabriel arrives at Earth as an angel in disguise, but when she gets exposed to the human entertainment that is video games, her personality does a full 180\u00b0 turn. Instead of helping people out, she now spends her time locked up in her apartment playing video games. Instead of calling herself an angel, she now calls herself a \"faillen\" angel.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime tells the story of the wacky things that happens to Gabriel and her just as wacky companions in their everyday lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThere's nothing special or unique about the art and animation in this anime, in my opinion. I mean, I haven't really seen anything amazing from Doga Kobo, the animation studio for this, yet. We've seen something like this before, so there really isn't anything to gush about. Although, it does successfully manage to set the tone for the show and deliver the message, \"this is a comedy anime!\" to the viewers loud and clear. The art and animation does its job, and that's most important.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nTo be honest with you all, the only music I really paid attention to was the OP. I thought it was extremely charming in its own way. Go on and give the OP song a listen. What do you think about it? Yes, it's energetic. Yes, it's loud. But more importantly than that, it sounds like everyone singing is just having tons of fun. Heck, the lyrics make it seem like they aren't even singing at all! Read the English translation, it sounds like the four main characters are just having a normal conversation with each other. Honestly, I think this is genius and amazing. Sure, this may not be the first anime song to do this, but I really liked how did it in this OP.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, really. A huge part of why the comedy works is the excellent voice acting. If it weren't for that, then I think that the comedy wouldn't have such a strong effect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThe four main characters: Gabriel,Vigne, Raphiel, and Satania, are extremely lovable and really naturally funny.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Gabriel, the shut-in angel turned into \"faillen\" angel. Vigne, the demon in training that is more angelic than demonic. Raphiel, the angel who makes questionable decisions when it comes to having fun (most of which involve a certain \"archdemon\"). And Satania, the archdemon who is just a total airhead. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a single dull moment when these 4 are at the same place at the same time. The way they interact with each other is really entertaining, and, of course, funny. Call me immature if you don't appreciate this kind of humor, but I found everything really funny. I would constantly just smile and laugh like an idiot during every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved every single second I spent watching this show. All the jokes had me laughing out loud at every moment. I wish the anime never ended, sigh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a chill comedy anime to watch, then I recommend this show. You might like it, or you might not like it. It depends if the humor in this show is the kind of humor you actually like. It's a hit or miss kind of situation, really. I know people who thought the humor was too immature for their tastes. I just so happened to be the type who likes this kind of comedy. So, if you're anything like me, then you're sure to love this show just as much or even more than I do.",

            "content": "I honestly have no clue why the rating for this anime is so low. Guess ratings really don't matter, I've seen an anime rated around 8.7 and I enjoyed Gabriel Dropout way more than said anime. I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not I would even watch this anime, and I'm glad I eventually decided to. One factor as to why I eventually watched was because I wanted to understand memes with Satania in it- later on that in the Character section of my review...\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis I would give an 8, simply because in a lot of these 12-episode series there isn'treally a plot. Its more so just a jumble of events which don't really lead to one another in any way. I'm not against that, I just think to deserve anything higher than an 8 there has to exist some kind of flowing plot line which Gabriel Dropout didn't have.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the visuals were great. I like the way the expressions of Satania/Gabriel would change according to how they felt and in my opinion it added a lot in terms of humor. Also the characters are drawn very nicely and in a way it reflects their personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCatchy OP and ED, memorable and fitting to the tone of the anime. Didn't find myself ever skipping them which is always a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this was what made this anime so good. I initially watched this anime only because I saw lots of Satania memes and wondered, who the heck is this girl and why does everyone love her? Well I think I can now adequately answer that question. The characters in this anime are just so well made and they really drive  the humor in the story. Similar to anime like Konosuba (which I recommend too), lots of the laughing comes from just seeing them be together, seeing their personalities clash and mesh together. You have Gabriel who is literally the best actor in the world, hiding her sloth-like lifestyle behind a smile whenever she needs to. You have the responsible Vignette who deep down really cares about everyone but at the same time puts on almost a mother-like scolding face towards the group. You have Raphiel who I thought was the most interesting because she didn't really have one defining characteristic- I thought she would be mean at first because of how she mocked Satania, but at the same time she doesn't have purely mean intentions, they're just for fun. Finally, Satania who is pretty much the main source of humor for this anime. She's so dumb but at the same time embraces it to make it a comedic experience for everyone watching her. And its cool to see how Gabriel at first seems to hate her, but eventually grows warm to her and builds a strong bond with her, the same going for all her other companions.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters were exceptional and made every episode enjoyable. There was never a moment where I found myself wishing for an episode to end. In fact, I'm kind of sad its over now, because I found it so entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are on the edge about watching this anime, I really recommend it if you are looking to laugh. It's short anyways, so if you don't like the first few episodes simply drop it, because the rest of the anime doesn't really change. Yes, its a little cringey because there's literally no boys in this show and you are just watching a bunch of anime girls mess around, and I kept thinking to myself at first, \"why the hell am i even watching this?\" but in the end I don't regret it. Its a really unique kind of humor that I've never found watching any other show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\nPS: Truth be told, I'm quite proud of my house blend. To attain my flavor and fragrance, I use five different types of coffee beans.",

            "content": "I wish I watched Gabriel Dropout sooner, because it was basically a comedy show. Each episode was full of laughs and although it got a bit more serious in the last few episodes, there were still scenes that were worthy of laughing at.\r\nIn terms of story there wasn't much in the way of story development the anime is more for the shits and giggles than the story IMO. In summary, the story revolves around Gabriel, Raphiel, Vignette and Satania and their interactions+struggles with the people around them and each other.\r\nAnimation wise is nothing too special. It's decent especially the animation of heaven and the characterdesign of the angels and demons. \\n\\n\r\nMusic is also quite decent I like the ending sounds pretty groovy.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of the anime is about the characters and how they grow or in the case of Gabriel, fall further and further into the abyss. A huge chunk of the anime goes into character development of Gabriel, Raphiel, Vignette and Satania which makes the audience feel connected to the 4 characters. There's Gabriel who's lazy though she does help her friends, Vignette who's caring and friendly who should be more of an angel than a demon, Raphiel who's gentle and nice but has a sadistic streak in her and Satania, who proclaims that she's the most evil demon but always end up failing in her attempts to be one. My favorite character in the anime is Raphiel she's damm hilarious to watch and is voiced by Kana Hanazawa who has a voice of an angel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if I had to rate the anime based on the 4 factors it'd be as follows:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.4/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: 7.6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10",

Then he created the sky and the land and all these other things we have now. And God saw that we became creatures of sheer laziness who get bored easily so he said, Let there be Gabriel DropOut: and there was Gabriel DropOut. And all's right in the world.\r\nOh, but during the process, clumsy God accidentally reversed the biblical archetype when the angels turned demonic and the demons turned angelic. Yes, you heard that right. He somehow stuffed up! The angels are now in needof some heavenly rehabilitation while the demons are, well... they need to learn how to be hellish again I guess. But if you're wondering, I think this change is pretty nice. In fact, it actually succeeds in bestowing divine fun upon us!\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, this show is not spectacular storywise.

Where it really shines the most lies in the great comedic value, which comes from the role reversal I've stated above. It might be a small change, but it certainly is effective. The result is that the character dynamic is funny as hell to watch. And if you want to know how entertaining that is, then let's go meet them!\\n\\n\r\nBringing all kinds of shenanigans to Earth, we have the lazy Gab and the sadistic Raphi as the angels while the sweet Vigne and the idiotic Satania are the demons. Now... what do you think will happen when you put these antithetical characters together in one place? Armageddon? Another Noah's Ark? Maybe even the Second Coming of Jesus Christ?! Hell naw. Hilarity will ensue on a scale big enough to tremble even God himself! I know right. God must be facepalming so hard after seeing what happened to them. Gab, the \"Faillen Angel\", just wants to lounge around when she became addicted to games, much to her friend's dismay. That friend, Vigne, is too much of a kind sweetheart considering she's supposed to be an evil being from the fiery realm. At least Satania tries to live up to her self-proclaimed \"Future Queen of Hell\" title, but her stupidity erases most of her wicked acts, so she's what you can call a harmless failure. Then there's Raphi, who pretty much loves to troll Satania with sadistic intentions\u2014a huge no-no for an angel. Their interactions and comedic gags are the heart of the show. Sure, some jokes do get repetitive at times, but plenty of refreshing ones are here to liven up your day.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even better, the comedy is not all this show has to offer! Bits of heartwarming moments are sprinkled here and there to make me smile warmly. Side characters also make their appearances to give even more charm to the character chemistry, in particular with an angel named Tap. So even though Gabriel DropOut is mainly comedic, there are other elements in this show that are miraculously enjoyable to revel in.\\n\\n\r\nTo complement the cheery atmosphere, God the creator and Doga Kobo did a collaboration together to bring out the life in the word lively. Exaggerations, caricatures, simple brightness, and cute expressions are all you need to perform a ritual to summon comical moe. You could definitely make a religion out of this! I mean, it's called CGDCT anyways. Never mind that, I also loved the quirks given to the characters with the angels having hair colors of purity while the demons get the nether colors. Wings, horns, pitchforks, and halos are the decorative pieces that adorn this show with its own identity.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't expect to hear the harps and ethereal chorus from heaven or the raging sounds of fire burning in hell here. Though there are some churchly tunes, the majority of the soundtracks are just your standard, run-of-the-mill ones that play softly in the background. The voice-acting, on the other hand, personifies the characters really well. This, along with the opening and ending song, is certainly the essence of fun entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have come this far through this holy review, then I praise thee, O great Saint! For now you know my positive thoughts on the creation we call Gabriel DropOut. Perhaps, you could spread this gospel over to other potential followers as well if you find the show enjoyable. After all, this is what God has made for us lazy humans!",

            "content": "Angels and Demons living together...MASS HYSTERIA!...hysteria indeed.\r\nFor a concept of angels being utter hellion demons to demons being the most angelic (or chunni) beings, put both of them together and see how they interact is a great premise and sure this comedy anime has it's share of problems but what makes this comedy anime stand out is it's characters...especially one that makes this anime all worth while.\r\nWith Gabriel DropOut characters, we have...Gabriel Tenma White the titular character voiced by Miyu Tomita who was the best angel in heaven until MMORPG's corrupted her and she became a lazy NEET angel. Next is Vignette Tsukinose April voicedby Saori Oonishi, a strict yet orderly demon and is the tsukommi to Gabriel's boke, but mostly tries to keep everyone in line. Raphiel Shiraha Ainsworth voiced by Kana Hanazawa is a caring angel but deep down is a masochist BUT towards Satania, she's an absolute sadist towards her, teasing to even putting Satania into paranoia levels whenever she's around. Lastly we have the aforementioned Sataniachia Kurumizawa McDowell voiced by Naomi Oozora...she's the BEST character in the series, not only for the aforementioned stuff she gets with Raphiel, but that she's one, a chunni demon who thinks she's a great demon by doing evil and horrible things...only for those acts she does to be absolutely petty and extremely minor cases of her chunni personality (as well as Raphiel misguidance) to make her an absolute riot the majority of the time. \\n\\n\r\nLA will say the obvious that this kind of setup is subjected to a huge case of running gag syndrome and yes LA will admit it does have it at times, Gabriel DropOut still uses it's running gags to it's advantage at times and thinks outside the box a la playing against the type even under different settings (with certain characters being put together alone etc.) A brilliant example is when Vignette tries to be more demonic, as a result she ends up like Satania instead. Other minor characters does come into the mix like Tapris voiced by Inori Minase and her being new to anything in the human world, Master voiced by Hideyui Umezu who misunderstands things from the main cast and Machiko the class president voiced by Mai Fuchigami being used by Gabriel for Gabriel's own benefits all used sparingly just to spice things up, mostly from Master and Iinchou who gets the most screentime, minor character wise. But even with it's running gags in place as well as playing against the type and adding characters here and there to spice things up, there is one unpredictability factor to Gabriel DropOut that makes this anime's comedy golden and that is Satania without a doubt, sure her running gag of always being the butt monkey of the group is a fact but it's her zany personality coupled with reactants of Gabriel, Vignette and Raphiel and her own misguidance makes the comedy unpredictable at times.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were flaws LA would state to Gabriel DropOut is that for an anime called GABRIEL dropout, Gabriel herself isn't the driving factor to all this as Satania essentially stole the show from her and coupled with Gabriel lazy demeanor makes her more of an active spectator than a catalyst, though to LA's defence against this flaw, she does inadvertently gets into the action of certain skits as long as it benefits her like wanting food or money or wanting to see Satania suffer to the final arc concerning Gabriel's older sister Zelel voiced by MIYUKI SAWASHIRO with some varying degrees of success comedy wise. For LA, Gabriel's involvement with Satania's suffering to the final arc were decently to hilariously handled well albeit some few running gags that didn't annoy LA too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Doga Kobo, who is by now known for making cute moe comedies, makes another one expected of their moe prowess and the animation is overall decent and moe as usual. Best yet is how well they do their character expressions and isn't limited to make some outrageously funny expressions (be it evil lazy intent or chunni hubris). Backgrounding isn't the most notable thing in this anime as it is a character-centered comedy and all. Overall expected Doga Kobo animation, not that that's a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voice acting is excellent with some varying. Saori Oonishi is above average to say the least and she does have great timing and all, Miyu Tomita is great as well even if she is voicing a lazy character though with this role, LA can say that Miyu HAS RANGE, but on speaking of range, Naomi Oozora is LA's favourite voice actor in Gabriel DropOut, all due to her chunni vocal range and the fact that Naomi Oozora could be as hammy as she wanted to, likely allowing Naomi to have LOTS of fun with this character and in a ways Naomi Oozora's role as Satania kinda brought Naomi into LA's radar all because of Satania because of this. Now, as much as this isn't Kana Hanazawa's fault but LA thought that Kana Hanazawa wasn't just doing enough, she didn't do horrible or anything as she was just voicing another Kana Hanazawa character with a sadist streak. LA is merely saying this because Miyu Tomita, Saori Oonishi and Naomi Oozora seemed to do much better and put in more effort than Kana Hanazawa did and it's Kana Hanazawa!!!.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut may have the same problems of having the running gags syndrome as well as main titular character who's less a catalyst to the comedy and more a reactant all due to her personality and everything, but Gabriel DropOut does have a silver demonic lining to all this, that being that Satania is such a saving grace (HA HA HA) and that the comedy has lots of unpredictability factors from it's settings to mixing characters together or just playing against the type from their running gags. Gabriel DropOut does have varying degrees of success but for LA, LA found the anime fun throughout and the comedy does tend to dip at times due to getting to cozy with it's running gags but with Satania REALLY being the saving grace and some genuinely unpredictability makes this anime's comedy great. \\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut is a great comedy anime with angels and demons who are quite the opposite to say the least. Gabriel DropOut is probably LA's 3rd favourite anime comedy for Winter 2017 and with such great comedies coming out from Winter 2017, Gabriel DropOut had a strong competition to contend with, but nonetheless Gabriel DropOut DIDN'T \"DROP\" away from one of LA's favourite comedies for Winter 2017, that's for sure.",

            "content": "Angels have been known as servants of God, creatures who reside in the heavens and watch over those in earth to help pass judgment of those created in God's eye.  Demons are those who live in Hell, and attempt to make people fall to temptation, and subsequently bring them down into the fiery pits of Damnation.  Despite having both of those creatures as its main four characters, Gabriel Dropout has nothing to do with what I described.\r\nStory: Gabriel Tenma White was a model student back at heaven, being given praise for her many accomplishments, and became the top graduate in her class.Now graduated from Angel School, Gabriel's next line of education has her go down to Earth and perform duties and tasks to report back to heaven.  Well, she would do her job but...there's an on-going raid boss in this MMO, so she can't do it.  \\n\\n\r\nMoe show, moe show, moe show.  Gabriel Dropout has four main girls, a practically all-female cast, and the plotline involves the main cast of characters going about their daily lives with situational comedy and repeated gags in order to fill up its twelve episode runtime make its way to the end.  Combined with one character that's the straight man while the other three are the ones that generally create some kind of mishap, the one gimmick that separates Gabriel Dropout from the rest is the gimmick of the characters being Angels and Demons.  More specifically, the Angels acting more like demons while the Demons act more like angels.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite being your typical moe show, the gimmick of Angels and Demons does get used quite often in the series.  It's a precursor for many of its episodes, and it adds a little bit more flavor to the story as the outlandish things such as giant pet familiars, a trumpet that can end humanity with one blow, and various items from Hell come into the story often enough to remind you that this show has something else to rely on aside from moe shenanigans for comedy.  Though it adds flavor, most of the time the show will just remind the audience that the characters are angels and demons, and run with the characters' innate ignorance on how Earth (specifically Japan) works.  \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy comes in two ways.  Either it's about one of the demon characters, Satania, getting her sanity tested by how much the world hates her, or it's about the whole role reversal with the angels being assholes and the demons being genuinely nice people.  The show boasts these two situations very often, and it becomes the brunt of what the show is with varying degrees of success, as some of the jokes go out of their way to be crazy and absurd while others are largely what you would expect in any other show without any sense of originality.  Despite that, the majority of the show's comedy comes out snappy and quick.  The characters never linger on one specific gag for long, so the investment for each one is very small.  This works in the show's favor, especially with the many of the jokes being rehashes of ones told or executed before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gabriel Dropout is a comedy that succeeds in some aspects, and fails in others.  The main gag of Angels and Demons swapping their intended personalities, as well as beating Satania with the metaphorical large stick is largely what the show falls on when making the majority of its content.  As such, its content can feel stale at times, and the use of its reused gags can be both entertaining, or lackluster when done more than once in a specific timeframe.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Uses its gimmick fairly often\\n\r\n+/- Situational Comedy \\n\r\n-  Many reused gags \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Like any moe-based show, characters are the key for success.  No good characters, no entertaining show.  Gabriel Dropout manages to give its audience very extreme versions of several common anime tropes in order to fill up its cast, that ultimately I feel works in the show's favor.  Mostly.\\n\\n\r\nFirst are the angels.  Gabriel and Raphiel.  Gabriel, named after God's messenger, and Raphiel, named for the angel who performs all manner of healing, are, as expected with the role reversal, don't at all perform the tasks that their namesakes do.  Gabriel here is instead a brash, irritated NEET who refuses to do any form of her work herself and instead lazes around the house playing games, and Raphiel is a hardcore sadist who finds joy in the suffering of others and prefers to stand in the background and smile while letting things, unfortunate or not, happen before her.  The character don't change over the course of the series and, much like the demons, are characters made to get the audience to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the angels, Vigne and Satania.  Vigne named after one of Hell's commanders, is the nicest character in the series, showing compassion towards everyone (no matter how condescending they might be) and acts as the straight man to her friends' crazy antics that would make anyone lose their sanity within the first week.  Satania, a strange demonization of the lord of hell himself, is a chuuni who believes that she will become the queen of hell and, when accompanied by her organ piano sting, gives speeches about how all will fall to her grasp and she will rule over everything with an iron fist.  While Vigne is largely designated to be the sane character to keep the absurdity from going too far, Satania acts the role of being the butt of all jokes.  Her bread keeps getting stolen by a dog, she got shot once, left unconscious on a balcony, arrested for trying to enter heaven, etc, etc.  It gets to the point that the show largely becomes the 'Satania show' because everything she is and does is so commonly the focus of many episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast largely fall into one-off characters that're either just normal humans with the occasional other angel/demon in the later episodes to show that heaven/hell isn't just occupied by two girls.  They don't really add much beyond creating a new scenario for the characters to react and fool around in, so they don't really hold much weight in the series as a result.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Gag characters that further cement the show's brand of comedy\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Doga Kobo, Gabriel Dropout has a very clean and bright look to it as expected of a show featuring four girls.  The color palette leans towards a lighter color scheme and the art and animation are consistent without many flaws.  Though really, that's just par for the course.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as comedy goes, the show largely uses exaggerated character expressions and various other common comedy gags like shifts in background, more exaggerated character expressions, and overall just things you would normally see in any other comedy show.  It works, but there's nothing really unique about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, clean art\\n\r\n-  Standard fare without much actual variation for being different\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP and ED are nothing truly special.  You have the seiyuus of the four main characters sing the pop title songs with not really much to talk about.  The only thing that I could say would be truly unique is how the OP has two different tones for whomever's singing, aka a gentle tone for the angels and a more dramatic tone for the devils.  Once again, they're decent songs, but nothing really all that special.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  As always, comedy is a subjective subject, as one's funny bone can be tickled by one thing while it might not really affect another.  Gabriel Dropout was this season's guilty pleasure for me.  Despite not being very creative and at its core, just being another moe show with a few added gimmicks to help it play out a bit more uniquely, I enjoyed the show and found it to be entertaining.  I'm someone who gets amused very easily, so the slapstick was something that resonated with me.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nProbably far too much than I really should.  I particularly like Gabriel's character mostly because I'm a fan of nonchalant assholes who can do something without so much as batting an eye at the consequences.  She's straight to the point, she doesn't give a damn, and I love it.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I wasn't a fan of Satania.  Mostly, I wasn't a fan of her gags.  The show really likes to make her the butt of every joke, and the consistent bullying on her got pretty old.  Especially regarding her food constantly being stolen; that got old very quickly.  Not only that, but her constant chunni speeches had me in a 'meh' state.  But that's just me.  Everything in a comedy show is subjective from person to person.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a comedy moe show, Gabriel Dropout stands out as being a pretty decent choice.  Thought it's not as unique as it may originally lead on to be, it still is a show that many people have been able to enjoy.  Again, comedy is subjective, and the show will not meet everyone's tastes and expectations.  But if you are a fan of some slapstick moe comedy, this show's a pretty fun thing to watch.",

            "content": "This is a Anime that i really do enjoy and might be one of my favorite new shows of the year. But there is one thing that holds it back for me at least. \r\nStory: isn't anything special or great. It lacks in the fact that there isn't any overall story. It's mostly just a bunch of stories that you would find in a filler episode. With nothing big happening besides maybe the the cast going back home fro a little and Gabriel's sister visiting. The no big story arc or anything similar is kind of a let down and holds it back from givingit a higher review. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: While not anything new it is still pleasing to the eye and fits along with the story being told 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Is what i'd expect from a good show. The opening is fitting and funny and the music even if it can sound generic at time. It knows when the right time to play. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is honestly the thing that holds it back for me the most. All the characters are good and funny. Not a single character that is annoying in all honesty. But when we come to the main character ( Gabriel ) It is kind of sad is a way i'd put it. She goes from an overachieving Angel wanting to only do good. To a slob who is constantly asking for money from friends, Lazy and barely actually goes to school without her friend telling her to. For me i was constantly wanting her to at least go back to being a nice Angel. There was one point at the end where it seemed like her sister was gonna start helping her with rehabilitation. But then she gets scared of a dog that is the only thing close to annoying. The entire Gabriel being a slob and her kind of throwing her life away took away from my enjoyment. If it wasn't for this thing the anime probably would have been one of my favorite animes of the year. I'm still kind of annoyed with that bait and switch at the end and still wish she becomes a good angel again. 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with my gripes about the story and characters. I still had a good amount of enjoyment out of this. It is funny and knows when its time to pull a joke. There are some times parts where you are enjoying something happening and then it just cuts into another story. That is kind of annoying. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I recommend watching this. It is a funny show with characters being funny and surprisingly few complaints about this. Still wish that the Gabriel character arc could have been left on a better note but oh well. Hopefully the manga ends on a better one or if there is a second season. 8/10",

The popularity of the manga can be spelled out by ASCII Media Works and curious itself by a manga magazine called Dengeki Daioh manga Shounen. The Manga has been released sinceDecember 2013 and still written on January 10, 2017, ago. This manga has reached series volume 4 and volume 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio that working on this anime is the Douga Kobo studio that was founded 1973. For you, maybe this studio is very familiar to you guys. Douga Kobo is a side-studio from another large studio that is Toei Animation. Their famous anime title like Yuru Yuri (2011), Love Lab (2013), Hidan no Aria (2015) and much more. This studio also works on anime Plastic Memories (2015).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime can be said have a very understandable percentage of jokes. Not bad for you guys who really like an easy and enjoyable comedy. Masahiko Ohta is the person behind this anime. The most famous anime such as Himouto Umaru-chan (2015) and To Love-ru (2008) are self-directed anime.\\n\\n\r\nInori Minase, seiyuu of the Rem character of the anime Re: Zero also filled out the voice of a character from Tapris in this anime. But, she only gets a little ration for this anime because it has to fill out voice auxiliary characters. In addition, this anime also presents fanservice that is very funny and different from other anime. But actually, the anime isn\u2019t much present fan service because there are no main male characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime features unique OP and ED Songs each titled Gabriel Drop Kick and Hallelujah Essaim written and composed by this anime BGM composer Kenichi Maeyamada and sung by a full seiyuu from the main anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime is worth watching for you who loves comedy genres because its sleek character design is wrapped with unexpected fan service and is backed by a director who is used to being caught in the genre that makes Gabriel Dropout very funny.",

            "content": "----------\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. \r\nWhile I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!\r\n---------\r\nPositives\r\n---------\r\n- Comedic Focus\r\nUnlike other CGDCT (Cute Girls Doing Cute Things) anime, which provide chuckles and the occasional happy \"aww hehe\", Gabirel Dropout aims squarely at your funny bone. It's a comedy first and foremost,and its situational/character based humor can hit some really high notes. Whether its a fresh dose of Satania bullying, or Gabu's deadpan delivery, each episode is guarenteed to have you leaving in a much better mood than when you started it.\\n\\n\r\n- Effortlessly Cute\\n\r\nThe show does not force its cuteness on you like others in similar genres. The cuteness of the characters shines through their actions and reactions, which feels very genuine. There are obviously some moments of visual cuteness as well, but it's not overdone and is mixed effectively with comedic elements for maximum efficiency! You'll find it hard not fall in love with all of the characters' devilish and angelic ways.\\n\\n\r\n- Lovable Cast\\n\r\nGabriel Dropout's main draw is its characters. While somewhat trope-y and not horribly deep, they all manage to be lovable and fun to watch in their own way. Attempting to pick a favourite in this show is like picking between favourite children! It is truly the chemistry of these characters that helps the show shine, as they are more than just the sum of their parts. Every interaction between each pair or group of characters is just as satisfying as the last, and you should never feel begrudged to watch any combination of the cast goof around in the human world.\\n\\n\r\n- Effective Aesthetics\\n\r\nThe animation and art direction of the show mirrors its other aspects: Simple, but polished to a shine. I don't remember a single instance of a stand-out animation error or mis-step. If you're looking for spectacle or over-the-top animation, this series is not to place to look, however that is also not its goal. It's goal is to provide an enviroment where its characters and their interactions stand out, which is provides perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n- OP/ED\\n\r\nOne of the best OP/ED pairs I've ever seen. Shows which incorporate their VAs into the production of their theme songs are a personal favourite of mine, and Gabriel Dropout takes the extra step to make the songs incredibly relevant to the show, whether it be the mood of the melody or the lyrics themselves! Incredibly enjoyable to watch and listen to each episode, and I've played both songs by themselves hundreds of times since watching. \\n\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n---------\\n\r\n- Repitition/Lack of Surprises\\n\r\nMany of the show's jokes rely on similar setups, and you can see many of the jokes coming from a mile away. This can be a big positive if you're fully invested in the setup, but if you're not 100% on board already, it's understandable that you might be turned off by how predictable the show can be at times.\\n\\n\r\n- Shallow Depth\\n\r\nThere isn't a deep or long plot to Gabriel Dropout. There are a few trials and tribulations along the way, combined with a few setting changes, but overall the show aims to keep things \"short story\"-esque rather than long novella.\\n\\n\r\n- Originality\\n\r\nGabriel Dropout is not the most original series. You could probably find an anime counterpart for each of the characters in the show, and the base premise itself is not spectacular. If you seek originality, or a subversion of the genre, you will not find it here.\\n\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nAre you a fan of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things? Do you enjoy light comedy that centres on its characters' core personalities and how they interact with each other? Do you ever dream of having a devil waifu sing you to sleep at night? \\n\\n\r\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, Gabriel Dropout is an anime you can't miss. It may not look like much, but its a show that set out to do a few key things and absolutely nailed the delivery. It is a great example of the power of well-written character interactions transforming a show from a few simple premises into something special that is much greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\n\r\nThe few negatives I could find in this show were not only hard to find, but did not bother me personally at all (I included them for posterity's sake). I enjoyed every second of watching this show, and will continue to in future rewatching sessions.\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nWhile it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: \"Would you recommend I watch this show?\". Specifically, I like to answer that question for both those familiar with the show's genre(s), and those new or interested in the genre(s). So,\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of light comedy, or CGDCT, I would absolutely recommend Gabriel Dropout as one of the best combinations of both.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are new to/interested in the above genre(s), Gabriel Dropout is a fantastic introduction into both, and I would still enthusiastically recommend it.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMy mother and father always had to drag me to church every Sunday when I was a kid.\r\nI hated going. No video games. No running around. No talking. It was sit, stand, sit, and stand again for an hour or more. Singing songs that I never memorized and hearing yet another lady read an aside that I didn\u2019t much care for. I loathed it all.\r\nI was angelic in other ways, like how I would go to catechism and say prayers every now and then. But, when it came to church, I was practically a demonin human form.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut (remember to capitalize that second \u201co\u201d) features characters of a similarly mixed good-and-bad nature \u2013 and more than enough comedy to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHaving just graduated from heaven\u2019s educational system, Gabriel, the angel all other angels aspire to be, heads to Earth to live on its soil and understand the humans who inhabit it. She\u2019s as perfect as ever as she grows accustom to life there \u2013 until she plays an online video game. At that point, the angelic Gabriel becomes the slothful Gab, and Gabriel DropOut begins.\\n\\n\r\nDesigned almost purely as a comedy, this anime strikes at the heart of one the most fundamental aspects of hilarity: incongruity. Through subverted expectations, the show clearly understands how to get at laughs while also exploring its premise to a reasonable degree.\\n\\n\r\nThese expectations are easy to spot. Gab and Raphi are angels, so one expects them to act kind and thoughtful and lovely. Similarly, Vigne and Satania are demons, so one expects them to act evil and ruthless and unfair.\\n\\n\r\nIn true subverted fashion, though, they act in a complete opposite manner. Gab lazes about and threatens to blow up the whole world along with its filthy humans. Raphi schemes and plots to create amusing situations that she can enjoy. Vigne cares about her friends as well as maintaining a proper lifestyle. Satania commits \u201cdastardly\u201d deeds, but she isn\u2019t always the smartest girl out there.\\n\\n\r\nThese demonic angels and angelic demons make it easy for Gabriel DropOut to get its audience laughing. In one scene, Satania squares off against Tap, making the na\u00efve angel fight for Gab\u2019s honor Old-Maid style. In another scene, Gab gets drunk off amazake, flying high into the sky with her wings to ring in the New Year with a \u201cbang.\u201d This constant flurry of incongruity may arguably get repetitive in the long run since there\u2019s only so many ways Raphi can trick Satania or Vigne can be the responsible one in the group. Nevertheless, the quick pace and the high amount of interaction among the four girls keeps the comedy chugging right along.\\n\\n\r\nBy extension, the anime explores this angels-and-demons premise to a reasonable degree. Some episodes have them trying out the human traditions known as \u201cHalloween\u201d and \u201cChristmas.\u201d Some episodes use the premise against them, like when Raphi holds up a version of the bible whose majestic light harms Satania. Some episodes even feature a return to their worlds up high and down under to give a perspective relative to their respective origins.\\n\\n\r\nNot every joke relies on expectations and the premise itself, though. Raphi dealing with a too-tight bra on physical-fitness day or Vigne trying to teach Gab the joys of sandcastle making focus more on their individual traits to get at character-based comedy. Doing so helps in varying up what\u2019s presented and therefore introducing even more chances at laughter.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the anime covers most types of comedy. It has running gags with the dog stealing Satania\u2019s treasured melon bread. It has situational funnies like when Gab squeals loudly as Vigne applies topical ointment to heal her mosquito bites. It has wordplay such as when Gab says she will \u201chalf-ass\u201d playing with her little sister but the horsey ride suggestion makes for the perfect response: \u201cI\u2019ll die, half-ass!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, Gabriel DropOut finds itself in an unfortunate pitfall, for the anime relies way too much on the \u201csay the opposite of what\u2019s about to be said or going to happen\u201d tactic. A prime example occurs in episode eight. As Vigne and Satania sit in front of their teacher to practice upcoming interviews, Vigne internally describes what Satania shouldn\u2019t do and their teacher will do. Only for the oblivious girl and the stern man to not follow her train of thought.\\n\\n\r\nIf one gets very technical, it still counts as subverting expectations. But the difference lies in the delivery. Where the original angels-and-demons approach uses cleverness, this method foregoes subtlety, refusing to let these scenes play out naturally. The result makes it easier and easier to guess what joke the show has lined up next the further along one gets into the season, reducing its effectiveness as a comedy anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Gabriel DropOut\u2019s comedy comes through in the vast amount of reaction faces Gab and the other girls regularly use. From Satania\u2019s cheeky grin to Raphi\u2019s bulging cheeks. From Vigne\u2019s exuberant smile to Gab\u2019s deadpan stare. The girls constantly shift between humorous faces befitting their characters and their situations, giving the anime extra laughs in nearly all its scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFluid animation also makes its way in for most of the series. Extra frames for Gab\u2019s legs during a low shot of her walking or Vigne slamming her door while kicking both Satania and Raphi out of her apartment prove this statement well enough. Even all the way into episode eight, when Satania and Raphi race one another, the animation keeps up, their running motions and hair jostles reflecting how much the show gives movement its due.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also adopts a caricature-bubble overlay for a lot of its conversational scenes that keeps the focus on the event at hand while also bringing in more silliness. Some colorful, flavorful backgrounds also help with upping the anime\u2019s visual variety as do the rare in-anime fourth-wall breaks.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the setting doesn\u2019t allow for much in the way of intrigue. Gab\u2019s messy room, the school grounds, and the occasional visit to the classy caf\u00e9 don\u2019t have much to offer artistically. But the general quickness of the show and the emphasis on its jokes make this lack of background satisfaction a moot point.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters\u2019 designs, they achieve different levels of success. Gab\u2019s design sits on the higher end due to the contrast between her radiant and slothful selves. The former prim and proper, the latter frazzled and often in nothing more than a big zipped-up jacket.\\n\\n\r\nSatania and Raphi are middle of the road. Satania\u2019s red hair, bat hairclip, and upside-down cross symbol on her tie paint her as the archdemon she claims to be. Raphi\u2019s very light purple hair, cross hairclips, and large chest give her an attractive design that hides her conniving ways.\\n\\n\r\nVigne\u2019s design ends up at the end, for, while her short purple hair and flowering ponytail give her a cute look, she doesn\u2019t stand out in any memorable fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does reuse a noticeable amount of its art and animation from the first episode within the last few minutes of last episode, but that\u2019s not enough to take away from the fact that the show went out of its way to make the anime as visually comedic and fun as possible given its premise and genre.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs an almost purely comedic anime, Gabriel DropOut doesn\u2019t have the most complex of characters. Gab, Raphi, Vigne, and Satania have their shticks that they almost never stray too far away from, leaving little room for nuance but inviting a ton of comedy as a result.\\n\\n\r\nGab was once a top-tier angel, a role model for both those in heaven and those on Earth. However, upon playing her first MMORPG, she got sucked into the lazy lifestyle of grinding experiencing and participating in timed events. She no longer cared about doing good by others but instead doing good for herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s the main protagonist of this tale, and a lot of her comedy comes through in her lackadaisical approach to nearly everything. She can\u2019t work more than once a week for a couple of hours because (as she similarly puts it) she would die of exhaustion. She always wants to copy Vigne\u2019s homework. She doesn\u2019t like changing out of her clothes because it\u2019s too much work. In short, the anime doesn\u2019t use the word \u201cdropout\u201d in its title for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nGab isn\u2019t all about laziness, though. She hates how many humans exist in the world. She likes to mess with Satania directly. She scarfs down food like nobody\u2019s business. She can even trick everyone into thinking that she\u2019s back to her former self.\\n\\n\r\nRaphi is a bit different. Unlike Gab who thrives off doing next to nothing, Raphi gains pleasure in life by seeing her friends in silly situations. More specifically, she revels in toying with Satania, her \u201cplay thing.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhenever Raphi is on-screen, and especially when Satania is nearby, the audience can be sure that Raphi is up to something. Be it telling Satania to only wear her swimsuit beneath her clothes or hypnotizing her with a \u201cMerry Christmas\u2026 Melon Breadmas\u2026\u201d chant, Raphi doesn\u2019t let an opportunity to prank Satania go to waste. Going so far as to track the poor demon with GPS so she can instantly arrive at a moment\u2019s notice to witness Satania\u2019s next oddity.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Raphi is a one-trick pony, for, after this obsessive trait of hers, she doesn\u2019t have much of anything else. Save for one facet learned during the only time Satania \u201cbeat\u201d Raphi at her own game: a fear of frogs. Granted, this scene is very small and not brought up again, but the show at least tried to give her more besides pestering Satania.\\n\\n\r\nVigne is not an angel like Gab and Raphi. Instead, she\u2019s a demon. On paper, that is. For she, more so than her angelic friends, does what she can to be a diligent, wholesome person. She thinks about others, she attempts to learn more about humans and their culture, and she does her best at life\u2019s daily happenings.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Vigne is the straight man of the group, acting as the normal one while the lazy bum, the schemer, and the weirdo continue to cause havoc. In fact, she\u2019s arguably the only truly kindhearted person among them. This trait of hers even earns almost an entire episode all to herself; episode seven showcases her trying to be \u201cdemonic\u201d by not following the school\u2019s clothing standards and refusing to take notes during class.\\n\\n\r\nSatania claims herself to be an archdemon and the next queen of the underworld. In reality, she\u2019s a goofball whose skipping of homework and purchasing of \u201crare\u201d telemarketing devil items only leads to her crying and in trouble on more than one occasion. Her taste buds don\u2019t seem to exist, and that one dog always steals her precious melon bread. But she doesn\u2019t let that stop her from trying to \u201cconquer\u201d the area and the people around her.\\n\\n\r\nMore so than anyone else, Satania is meant to be the brunt end of almost every joke. She\u2019s picked on and almost never taken seriously, so it can sometimes feel a little unfair to watch. However, when she tries to make Gab serve her coffee in a demeaning way or acts all holier-than-thou when talking to Raphi, it becomes easier to understand why she\u2019s pranked almost all the time.\\n\\n\r\nShe rarely receives any comeuppance herself \u2013 save for defeating Tap, Gab\u2019s angel kouhai. And the show also reveals that her parents are the ones to blame for her inflated ego and overactive imagination. (At least their son has remained unaffected by their delusions.) Altogether, Satania is the jokester of the bunch (intentional or not), delivering laugh after laugh without doing anything else besides being herself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime doesn\u2019t care to explore anything too deep with any of these characters, it does contain a sentiment that almost anyone can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nAs is regularly shown, Gab and Raphi are angels, and Vigne and Satania are demons. Per these monikers, they are expected to be good and bad respectively. But that\u2019s not how people are; almost nobody is all good or all evil. They\u2019re a mixture of the two. Sometimes they say something mean or do the wrong thing. Other times, they support in their own way or try to do what they can to help.\\n\\n\r\nThese girls demonstrate this idea all the time. Gab may hate going to school, but she offers Tap a place to lodge for her visit to Earth. Raphi may tease Satania constantly, but she befriends Vigne despite their differences in origin. Vigne may push Gab in the right direction, but she isn\u2019t afraid to smack her upside the head when she\u2019s being uncooperative. Satania may think she\u2019s better than everyone, but she cares enough about that dog to give him the bigger half of her melon bread.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, that\u2019s not a lot to go off of. And, indeed, many of these moments are either just after or followed immediately by a comedic routine, making this thoughtful comparison pointless. Still, it\u2019s nice to see the anime go beyond the laughs and for something a bit more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Gabriel DropOut receive many strong voice-acting performances from their respective actresses. Kana Hanazawa as Raphi uses her cute voice to hide her sinister schemes. Miyu Tomita as Gab, in one of her first major roles, can be both kind and nonchalant in her attitude. And Saori Oonishi as Vigne brings both maturity and goodness with ease.\\n\\n\r\nYet (perhaps obviously) it\u2019s Naomi Oozora as Satania who steals the show. Her arrogant claims, the yelling, her \u201cevil\u201d laugh, and extremely silly behavior were only made possible by her impressive performance, breathing life into the character and elevating the comedy of the anime that much more.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s original soundtrack also has quite a few supportive songs. High-pitched notes and an ambient background effect combine to make those \u201ctense\u201d moments feel extra harrowing. Satania\u2019s devilish music, with the backing choir and pronounced organ, fill the air with satanic sounds. A slow, everyday tune changes its composition frequently, often taking on a shaking beat, a few strings, and the occasional rising note (that\u2019s fun to whistle along with) and providing a foundation for the anime\u2019s slice-of-life feel.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut also includes a lot of different sound effects and variances in sound to further promote its comedy. For example, in episode eight, Satania starts to fall over because she tripped over her feet, and her voice goes into super-slow-motion. The caricature bubbles are a more general example; a tiny horn sounds off whenever they appear on screen. These may not be necessary additions, but they certainly add to the show\u2019s overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the opening track, \u201cGabriel Drop Kick,\u201d has a lot to unpack because it does so much within its minute-and-a-half run. The warping of Gab\u2019s opening lyric highlights her \u201cfaillen angel\u201d status. The flurry of conversations that happen in the background immediately afterwards get at the craziness of the show itself. Then the song splits, using whimsical instrumentation for Gab and Raphi\u2019s segments but harsh, metal instrumentation for Vigne and Satania\u2019s segments to represent the dichotomy between the angels and the demons.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Satania\u2019s meta lyrics, Gab\u2019s sighing, and the fast-paced rhyming. Eventually, the track crescendos, leading to the cast singing together with lots of \u201cHappy!\u201d and \u201cYay!\u201d shouts for more fun. It ends in a much more reserved manner compared to the fervent, techno, and rocking formation beforehand, but such an ending adds yet another layer to an already jampacked piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, \u201cHallelujah\u2606Essaim,\u201d is nowhere near as involved as its OP counterpart, but it\u2019s not without its own flair. It combines chimes, electric guitar, choppiness, some cowbell (always need more cowbell), and techno to create a semi-serious, pretty cool piece. Loftier segments fit the angel-and-demon motif, the vocals are nice on the ears, and the little stepwise singing section near the end makes for a catchy outro.\\n\\n\r\nYet the most interesting aspect of the ED is the dual prayer that these angels and demons simultaneously recite in singsong form. The lyrics\u2019 almost-matching construction make for a clever moment in the track that, on their own, represent the contrasting nature of the piece quite handily.\\n\\n\r\nThough it isn\u2019t the voice acting, the OST, the OP, or even the ED that take the sound crown. Instead, a small little hymn from episode seven known as \u201cGabriel no Kazoeuta\u201d earns the throne. The entrancing lullaby isn\u2019t much, but Vigne\u2019s soft singing and cute pronunciation of \u201cGabriel\u201d turn the tiny track into a mini musical hit. Plus, it\u2019s darn catchy, and an ED version of the song plays at the end of the episode. Complete with a sped-up section and Vigne snoozing off by the song\u2019s end.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that I wasn\u2019t fully onboard with this one when I first checked it out as it aired. It seemed like an above-average comedy that didn\u2019t try for anything too daring or too interesting for me to consider worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nI still hold that perspective to some degree. But I cannot deny how each and every episode had me laughing my butt off.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of those laughs are thanks to those two too-cute demons: Satania and Vigne. They are no doubt the best, funniest characters in the show, and I was delighted whenever they appeared on screen. Satania crying out in nervous anguish as heaven\u2019s security guards dragged her away was hysterical, and Vigne\u2019s big smile after Tap said she looks forward to their tea time together had me smiling just as wide. They were a ton of fun, and they made for a lot of happiness again and again.\\n\\n\r\nRaphi and Gab are not as delightful as their demonic friends, but the angels had me laughing as well. Raphi catching herself from saying something twisted, with cheeks bulging and her hand covering her mouth, was a small action that brought about many a chuckle. And Gab unable to perform well at any of the physical-fitness tests at school, practically dying in the process, made her yakiniku-driven attempts an entertaining set of moments indeed.\\n\\n\r\nI was also a fan of the side characters. The coffee shop owner was a cool dude who simply loved coffee and looked out for Gab and the other girls whenever he could. Martiel, Raphi\u2019s female butler, was also a hoot thanks to her depraved devotion to the young miss.\\n\\n\r\nTap, too. She isn\u2019t around for very long, but she\u2019s also one of my favorites in the show. Higher than Gab and Raphi even. She is darn cute and has silly relationships with the whole cast. Once she learned how to code in C and Java (and soon PHP), she shot up even higher in my books.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, what solidified my liking of the show wasn\u2019t the fun characters or the jokes themselves. What really did it was Gab\u2019s thoughtfulness in episode eleven. Despite how much she rags on Satania, Gab secretly helps her archdemon friend by asking the coffee shop owner to let pets stay at Satania\u2019s complex so she could keep her \u201cfamiliar.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIt was a sweet moment, and, while not emotional or defining, it made it that much easier to say with certainty that the anime was a happy time for me all around.\\n\\n\r\nGabriel DropOut answers a few prayers. A focus on subverted expectations, lots of reaction faces, and an impressive lineup in the sound department prove its penchant for comedy and quality. Setting up a lot of its jokes in the same way and a lack of intrigue in the main cast do work against the anime. But, unlike a kid who hates going to church, this one has no loathing in sight.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, incongruity dominates this angel-and-demon comedy, backing itself with different types of jokes while falling prey to the \u201csay the opposite of what\u2019s about to be said or going to happen\u201d pitfall\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Good, hilarious reaction faces, caricature bubbles, and nicely animated segments make up for the passable background art and average character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Gab, Raphi, Vigne, and Satania have varying roles and effectiveness, and a tiny theme on the good-and-bad mixture in people adds more to think about\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Great, an involved OP, a cool ED, a supportive OST, and strong VA performances already do more than enough, but Vigne\u2019s special lullaby goes the extra mile\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, super funny the whole way through, and Satania, Vigne, and Tap outshine the others\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

Although it has some i don't say boring but slower moments but when it's funny it is funny. Expressions and reactions of the chars. really make this way funnier. Running jokes are simple but with each time they variate them slightly so they are don't became a bore. Even though the cast is filled with tropes we get to know them better and thus making them more 3 dimensional. Especially Gab who is hilarious. She really is a fallen angel but is deep down caring.Her interactions with other angels and demons are at best gold. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much more to say that this is enjoyable and and it's simplicity well executed. It's slower points are evened with it's funny moments and Gab is relatable shut-in that is fun to watch. Thats why the score is 7,7/10 rounded to 8/10.",

            "content": "Just to keep this review as brief, or maybe terse.\r\nTo be frank, the only appeal to this anime is the cuteness that it had in store for the moe watchers. Much like any other moe anime with high school setting and spending most of its time showing their daily lives of the characters of the show there, this anime is exactly that. It's not very different, well not different at all, from other typical show and all the archetypes and stereotype in other moe-ish or extremely moe anime. The comedy, much like in any moe anime, relies on cuteness, childishness, character's Ineptitude, misunderstanding, and partiallythe contradiction of role of behavior for a character with a given status (they did it differently from other anime here, given how most anime would just use appearances, this anime use both appearances and status, given their origin being both a descendant of angels to demons).\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like the moe shit, this show wasn't really that great for me, I like it abit, but most of the situation, conversation, and stuff happening in the anime, it bores me, well, not all of em.\\n\\n\r\nBut all the criticism of how atypical this anime is apart from its genre of moe comedy of girl's daily lives, some originality does take part in this anime. The anime has a very interesting premise, one that makes me decided to watch this anime tbh. It has a kind of story twists where this extremely successful, highly rank graduates, Gabriel, degraded into a corrupted angel, or rather, a fallen angel. This anime also has another twists of making cutely demonic entity, less demonic than the angel themselves. And pretty much they uses those elements to make the comedic skit far less humdrum. But really, this is just your typical anime of chill and watch some bright and cute anime after work, school, or some other shit idk. But i would rather prefer Kobayashi and Demi chan tbh. But hey, that's my thought on the anime. It's what makes us different :)",

It is in reality; 4 somewhat cliche angels and demons characters that do ridiculous things everyday at the human high school they attend. A 'slice of life', comedy and the unofficial CGDCT (cute girls do cute things). I will not rate the story, art or sound as it was never intended to excel at these things.\r\nThis is one of the very few shows that make me actually laugh every episode. The characters are well written and have intelligent dialogue between one another that perfectly compliment each other. It is simple and genuine. Each character alone may beweak but together I cannot choose any that I like or dislike more than others. Gabriel's relatable laziness, Vignette's na\u00efve innocence, Raphiel's blissful toying, Satania's misguided mischief, among with an interesting and likable set of supporting characters, like the Coffee store owner who is sweet and gullible, or their terrifying no-nonsense teacher.\\n\\n\r\nDo not question or demand of the plot, nor expect some meaningful character development or progression.

This doesn't have much of a story it's just for laughs and something to enjoy. It also had a religious theme to it and there's some talk about demons, angles, the apocalypse.

            "content": "Ok, Gabriel DropOut which is studio Doga Kobo's first production for this 2017 is ain't that bad, it's a series that follows the lives of 2 angles and 2 demons, but since this has a comedy genre, something awkward has to happen which isn't your expected good versus evil thing, it more like a slice of life that happens in Japan....I think. so........:\r\nFair 6, Story\r\nStorywise, I did mention that something awkward has to happen and of course we have this series....in an animated form that is, where we follow the lives of 4 supernatural entities whom where sent to earth to live a human life,now, the plot was for them supernatural beings to do something on earth, but ends up doing something else which wasn't expected of them where it has angels, whom were much devilish than them demons and demons who can't seem to do anything right in being  demons, now that is the funny stuff. But, hold it, funny as it may seem, the plot was basically more on Gabriel who from good has become a sloth, basically a typical Hokikomori and Satanica who tries to think of ways to be evil but ends up bonkers, with them in it, the humor turns into annoyance with the two mentioned characters  and let's not forget the bimbo Raphi where she spoils the fun with her lesbian element.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMediocre 5, Art\\n\\n\r\nSo, what else do I have to say about the character's illustrations? When , they're the usual eyecandy that every anime with a school genre has, the only consolation here, was seeing Satanica and Raphi in their bikinis, anything else, like panchira and boobs don't exist here.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound\\n\\n\r\nPiipoo mo deeboo mo enjo- mo hikkurumete hai\\n\r\nHAPPII \\n\r\nNandemo ii njanai ?

Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt ain't that good, but it ain't that bad either, to simply put it, my enjoyment was seeing Gabriel's oneesama giving her some spanking for her laziness, but in the end I really can't fathom as how useless, her powers of Clairvoyant of not predicting a dog, I mean, REALLY?! The fuck, an angel like Gabriel's oneesama is scared shit of a dog? What a way to end the anime.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7. Overall\\n\\n\r\nIt's good enough, to be viewed , the comedy is nice, but Gabreil and Raphi were just too annoying, so enjoy, HAPPY!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\npiipoo mo  deepoo mo \\n\r\nenjoo mo  hikkurumete hai \\n\r\nHAPPII \\n\r\nnandemo iin janai? fuffuu \\n\r\nhebbuun mo  herruu mo \\n\r\naasuu mo  gochamazede hai \\n\r\nHAPPII \\n\r\nminna de gakkou ikou  fuu \\n\\n\r\nsukkoronde  waa \\n\r\ndon subette  waa \\n\r\nweei! weei! \\n\r\n#%$\u20ac^%>$*}%+#%$\u20ac^%>$*}%+ \\n\\n\r\ndatte tenshi desu mono!\\n\\n\r\nHA,HA,HA,HAAAAAA!!!!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gabriel DropOut is an anime revolving mainly around Gabriel and her friends.  Gabriel is a prodigy angel who has been sent from heaven to study human life on Earth.  Accompanying her is another excelling angel named Raphiel.  Upon arriving to their new school, the angels meet two demons named Vignette and Satanichia, who are both sent from hell to accomplish a similar goal as the angels. \r\nGabriel seems to be the perfect angel, however one day she hears a cry for help from her laptop.  Unable to resist someone in need she joins a MMO and immediately gets hooked on it,but what once was her assisting those in need became her playing for her own enjoyment.  Now Gabriel shows her true colors to the viewers and she seems, well, not so perfect and is considered by many to be a \"faillen angel\".\\n\\n\r\nNow for the individual scoring:\\n\\n\r\nStory - \\n\r\nAs for story, Gabriel DropOut doesn't really have one.  There is no real point for this anime to get across nor is there any true conflict.  But for an anime that is considered to be comedy, plot isn't really a necessary thing to have, so it isn't a bad thing that it lacks plot.  Mainly what you will see in each episode are events that occur in the lives of Gabriel, Raphiel, Vignette, and Satanichia.  Just know that by watching this anime that there isn't much more to it than just their experiences here on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nArt - \\n\r\nThe art style  in Gabriel DropOut gives off very \"cute\" vibes.  This anime tends to have brighter, more saturated colors which would match the theme of the anime since it can be considered to be relatively upbeat.  Background art was well done and was complemenary with the style in character art.  Character art, while done very well and pleasant to look at, tended to be a little too consistent with all characters and made a large amount of characters faces heavily resemble one another, but this isn't too much of an issue because character designs were quite different from one another and stood out.\\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\r\nGabriel DropOut's opening and ending fit very well into the anime and I didn't feel the need to skip over the intro or outro whenever I watched an episode.  Soundtracks throughout the anime were also done well and in moderation, not very memorable but the usage of sound was done effectively.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - \\n\r\nEach character in Gabriel DropOut had interesting personalities and showed signs of some decent development throughout the season.  Also, just as a side note, you probably already know but Gabriel DropOut does not have any lead or important male roles as most of the characters are female.  Moving on, both Gabriel and Raphiel are portrayed as angelic in the beginning only for the audience to realize that they're putting up facades, and the same applies to Vignette and Satanichia when the audience expects them to be evil because they are demons, however we come to see that both of them do have good hearts despite being demons.  Also, each character was unique design wise and stood out from one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - \\n\r\nGabriel DropOut was a fun anime to watch to kill time with.  It's humor wasn't too outstanding, but it did provide amusement and each episode managed to stay relatively refreshing despite there being no real plot or motive present.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for an anime that isn't a huge commitment and wound give you a brief laugh, then Gabriel DropOut may be a nice choice to go with.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! If you choose to watch Gabriel DropOut, then have fun and enjoy!",

            "content": "Gabriel dropout is an anime that has many aspects for me to talk about, but  in short it's a fairly interesting mediocre comedy anime.\r\nStory : 6\r\nThere is not much of a story for this anime. It is pretty much episodic, there is not much to follow or harvest from this anime but at least the comedy part is funny.\r\nArt & Animation : 6\r\nThis section is what I want to talk about the most, first let's talk about art. The art is cute, background is well done, color management is fine nothing is really bad worth pointing out, but the real thing is the animation,they use a lot of still shot. The only thing animated is mouths, facial expression does not even change much, If it's not for its (sometimes) funny unapologetic humors  I think this anime would be nothing but a bad cute girl anime with no real value worth watching. They once recycled a scene from earlier episode. But I have to say it has its moments though, sometimes their movement is just really good but that rarely ever happen.\\n\r\nSee OP and ED if you don't get what am I talking about.\\n\\n\r\nYou could argue that because this is a comedy anime it doesn't need much animating but in my point of view great animation is what comedy anime needs. Body language and facial expression is what make a stupid anime like Nichijou a great comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9 \\n\r\nI like every characters in this series (Vigne more than others), not the most well written characters but charming enough. I give 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment : 7 more precisely 7.5\\n\r\nIf it's not because of the lack of animation and excessive use of still shot then I could give it an 8, still, in a month or so I think I might forget about this anime, but while I am at it I did had a lot of fun. So give this anime a try you will definitely love the girls!",

            "content": "A bit of background information about me discovering this anime: I am really active on reddit, especially on /r/anime and /r/animemes. I want to talk about /r/animemes for a sec, because /r/animemes is strangely obsessed with Satania from Gabriels Dropout. I wanted to check out why that is, so I watched Gabriels Dropout. Is Satania the highlight of Gabriels Dropout? Or does the anime stand strong on his own? Is it even a good anime? Well, get ready to laugh evilly and guard your melon-bread, this is my review of Gabriels Dropout.  \r\nStory: 7/10 \r\nWelcome to a world where Angels act likeDemons and Demons act like Angels. Gabriel is a model student angel who goes to the human world to study it. She wants nothing but to help mankind and save other people, but this believe doesn't stay for very long. When she discovers MMO games, she becomes a sloth and doesn't care that she is a angel. Vignette, a friend of gabriel who is also a demon, tries to get Gabriel back to her former self. Along the way they meet Satania, a demon, and Raphiel, a angel. From here it's just funny interactions and things that happen. The story is simple, nothing to comment on.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10  \\n\r\nI love how colorful it looks, other then that it is OK.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10  \\n\r\nThe music is pretty good. The OP is fantastic and the ED is okay, but the real highlight for me was the coffee shop music. Such smooth jazz that is makes my ears melt.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10  \\n\r\nOooooh I finally can talk about Satania, but she can wait. Oh she can wait. The main characters include Gabriel, a angel sloth who doesnt give a crap about anything, Vignette, a demon who acts more like a angel (she is very caring and wants to do good), Raphiel, a angel who has only one face, and Satania. Lets talk about Satania. She is my least favorite character in Gabriels Dropout. She is annoying, cringy, too full of herself and just unlikable. People on /r/animemes are obsessed with her because of her fang. Fangs don't make up for shit personalities people! The only times I liked her is when she had the right to be cocky. You know, when she actually won (which is ones in the blue fucking moon). Other then that, I can't stand her. Pfew, that was my short rant on Satania. The cast as a whole is actually pretty good, except for the bad apple. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10  \\n\r\nThe comedy was very hit and miss. For example: the Satania moments were misses and the Raphiel moments were hits. Even though I chuckled a few times, I think the comedy could've been better.  \\n\\n\r\nOveral: 7/10  \\n\r\nWhat can I say, it's another okay GCDCT comedy. If you like this genre you will like Gabriels Dropout.\\n",

Although introductions weren't made at first, you'll get to know them as you progress through the series.\r\nA little fast paced, but never boring. It's a full-on comedy mixed with a hint of heartwarming event which made me appreciate the series even more. Their everyday shenanigans were never boring and kept me looking forward to the next episode.\r\nFor those who wants a light, full-on comedy, I recommend watching this series. Just watch out for a certain demon's stupidity. Who knows, shemight have planned to get you to laugh. If that happens, you'll be at the palm of her hands.",

            "content": "You never know when and where you might come across a real gem that deserves to be more popular than it is at the moment. While this show seems like nothing special at first, it's a surprisingly funny and interesting anime that is worth checking out.\r\nStory: 7/10.\r\nThere are three worlds in this show: Human world, Heaven and Hell. They are all connected as angels and demons are sent to the Human world to fulfill their purpose. The idea of angels and demons coming to our ordinary world is not new, but the main four characters' shenanigans are so much fun to see. And the storyis not funny sometimes, it's funny all the way through, from start to finish, special episodes included. Besides, there is a strange charm in this adorable simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10.\\n\r\nIt's cute, it's simple and it fits the genre, even if the art style itself is nothing special or outstanding. And don't even get me started on brilliant facial expressions and cute character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\r\nFitting soundtrack, catchy opening and amazing voice acting, what else can one hope for when it comes to comedy?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe show is focused on the main four characters: two angels (Gabriel and Raphiel) and two demons (Vignette and Satanichia).\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show, Gabriel is a kind-hearted Mary Sue-ish angel and she is determined to help as many people as possible... until she discovers the magical world of video games. Gabriel immediately turns into a lazy, irresponsible geek that is not interested in anything but games and slacking off. She is somewhat similar to Umaru Douma. However, unlike the famous (or infamous? as someone who liked Umaru, I'll go with the former) himouto, she does not try to hide her real identity, unwilling to take part in any activities that require at least some sort of effort.\\n\r\nVignette is her best friend and a demon. And demons are supposed to be bad, right? But Vinny is the nicest and most responsible friend one can hope for and her main role is the voice of reason. In other words, she is the most adequate character in the show and, while one might find her boring, I think Vinny teaches us not to judge a book by its cover (a couple of episodes are dedicated to Gabriel's kohai learning this lesson).\\n\r\nRaphiel, despite being an angel, demonstrates certain sadistic tendencies, hiding them behind a seemingly dumb and naive exterior. However, I would not go as far as call her a yandere, as that is not all Raph is about. Later on, she demonstrates several redeeming qualities that make her a decent member of the main cast despite her peculiarities.\\n\r\nAnd finally, Satanichia. A demon who is hoping to become the next queen of Hell, claiming that she is Gabriel's rival. She talks big and is a bit of a tsundere, ashamed of her soft (and incredibly adorable) side. Even though she tries to act cool and make it seem like she does everyone a favor by hanging out with the rest of the cast, she is genuinely interested in the human culture and actually enjoys spending time with other three girls. Her interactions with the white dog are somewhat repetitive, but funny and eventually turn into a strong friendship.\\n\r\nThe main four characters are memorable and likable. When it comes to shows, there is always a chance that at least one character will turn out to be annoying. However, I liked them all. And it feels like I know them and they know me. A great example of a well-written cast that does not remain the same as the show goes on. Character development in a slice of life comedy? Yes, please.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\nI laughed. And I laughed a lot. Some jokes are unusual, some are not new, but their purpose is to entertain and that's exactly what they do, and they do it well. I loved this anime, both the TV show and special episodes. And, although I'm glad it wasn't too long (after all, it's easy to run out of ideas when it comes to this genre as it's hard to be original), I think I need more.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not going down in history, but it is a rare gem and a great example of a well-written interesting comedy with good characters that will always be with you.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Gabriel Dropout. This shows not bad. I normally dislike shows revolving around cute girls doing cute things, but I managed this one alright.\r\nThe story is irrelevant. Our main character Gabriel has just graduated and has been sent to Japan to live alongside humans to further her education. Our once top class angel descends upon japan and soon falls to the earthly delights of slacking off and playing video games.\r\nThat sounds cool and all but really the whole angel and demon backstory is only used for situational humor. Allowing us all a bit more of a giggle whilewe think of an angel who does bad things, or the opposite. This is a bit of a shame, but these types of shows are never about world building or stories anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was cute and vibrant. The opening soundtrack is great and the voice actors are all very fitting. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly basic. Gab is a fallen angel and a slob, Vignette is the demon who is surprisingly nice, Raphiel is a sadist, and Satanichia is a airhead with great aspirations. These characters are indeed cute and endearing and watching them can be entertaining for a bit. There really is no development. They simply play their part and we are invited to laugh at the antics of these not so theme matching characters. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show enough to recommend it. The comedy is a mix of stupidity and repeating jokes, and theme flipping. A demon acts like an angel and an angel acts like a demon, its funny right? I begrudgingly have to say it was, could have been better but the cuteness mixed with the theme flip makes it good enough.  The episodes are episodic and completely revolve around our 4 main characters and their reversed personalities. I will say its good it didn't try for more than 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Decent comedy and cuteness. No real point to the show, so only worth your time if you like theme flip comedy and cute things.",

Raphiel is the other angel in the anime she has a thing for seeing people suffer or in a way of finding her friends for amusing times (well bad things). Vignette is almost a angel in her self but is a demon but the way she acts and what not is charming and also the nice one and what not. Satanichia is basically the only real person who in a sense sticks to what she is a demon she usually like people groveling to her feet and what not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i personally really enjoyed this anime really the only thing you should look at is that if the comedy is goona be good or not and for me the comedy was good too top-notch good\\n\\n\r\nOverall: goona give this a 8 for sure the comedy was very good and also the fact the i like all the characters aswell gave me this rating",

If you liked or disliked one, you'll probably feel similarly about the other.\r\nThat said, Gabriel Dropout has more going on because there are more ensemble cast plots. The characters are one-note, and there are lots of recurring jokes of the \"kneejerk emoting\" type - probably too many to call it a strength. When the plots work, though, they can work very well, and that varies a lot from episode to episode. Like most shows of this type, the plotting doesnot aim to develop the characters or tie them to any larger concept, it exists simply to show different activities and facets of the characters as they are.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a strength of the show that everything else is done so consistently.

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nPls send feedback if you have any\r\nThe roles of order and chaos. I'm quite sure you know them. Angels are our saving grace, guiding us towards a life of selflessness and enlightenment. Demons wish to destroy any sign of ethics and morals, dragging us down to temptation and corruption. This knowledge has been passed down for generations, becoming a firm image of how we perceive heaven and hell... well, at least that was the case until Gabriel Dropout came out.\r\nAfter coming down to Earth to study humans, top-of-her-class heaven honour student/angel Gabriel Tenma White stumbles across an MMO (aka Massive Multiplayer Online) videogame in her room and get's utterly addicted. (How it got there is beyond me, it just kinda appeared) Once a dignified being of light, she has now crumbled into nothing but a NEET who cares little about others. We watch as Gabriel desperately tries to retain her newfound shut-in life, and along with a few friends that are also unable to properly act like their roles as angels and demons, their wacky mayhem provides us with a decent amount of entertainment, but ends up kinda lacklustre in the end.\\n\\n\r\nPlot progression? Never heard of it. Gabriel Dropout is an episodic anime, with only the last few eps really having any signs of continuance. (but even then there's this random little timeskip between eps that really confused me for like a minute or two) The little story that is there is incredibly predictable, only really providing some cheap drama and a laugh. So the story isn't that important, most animes like this don't place focus on plot, so what does it have? Comedy!\\n\\n\r\nMost of the comedy comes from the many faults of each character. In addition to our otaku angel, we have a fairly likable roster that consists of Vignette Tsukinose April, the nicest demon you'll ever meet, Raphiel Shiraha Ainsworth, an angel that enjoys the suffering of others, (don't worry she ain't a torturing/killing type, she just enjoys messing with people) and Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell, future queen of hell! (or at least that's what she tell everyone, she's actually quite the klutz) Each episode revolves around at least one of these four as they try and live a normal school life. It's incredibly hit and miss, some of the comedy making you burst out laughing while others just tend to not really leave a mark. It has a few jokes that are pretty clever, but in terms of comparisons, there are animes that have better humour. This is in no way saying Gabriel Dropout is bad, but it kinda sits in the shadow of other shows from this season like Konosuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid and even Interviews with Monster Girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really anything else to talk about when it comes to characters. Besides the main four, we get a few recurring people that are only really there to add to the comedy. Character development is non-existent, which is not that unusual for this kinda show, but when the anime revolves around how someone changed drastically for the worse, you kinda expect to see more talk about how heaven reacts to their top student's mighty fall. You see a glimpse of this happening, but it just ends up as another joke and become nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe angel/demon theme is only really explored in a few eps, most of the time it's only used to carry a joke. We get a glimpse into how heaven and hell works, but not enough to actually peak any interest. I understand its focus is on comedy but to leave what looked like such an important part of the anime untouched just indicates a show lacking in direction.\\n\\n\r\nI'm unsure whether I really enjoyed this anime as a whole. The comedy was nice but the rest is just mediocre. If all you want is a laugh, then I would recommend this, but for those that want a little more, you should look elsewhere.",

            "content": "This show isn't bad but I don't think it's great either.  If you can take one thing from this: choose to use other fansubs than Crunchyroll, I bet you'll get a much more better experience as a result.  A lot of really dumb translations from CR that I was able to notice.  \"Thanks for the food.\" was translated to \"Praying to the dark lord\" or some shit like that.  If you care about that, then go search for fansubs.\r\nThe story, it's basically a Japanese Highschool CGDCT show but with Angels and Demons flair.  It's unique in that they have theHeaven and Hell aspects but I don't think they do much with the potential of the settings as they should have, in my opinion. So basically you're just watching a regular slice of life with sci-fiction elements to it.  For some this is perfectly fine but for me, I've seen a lot of these already that I was not getting impressed with the story as is.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, it's all subjective, man.  If you love the comedy in the first few episodes then you'll love this show.  If you were on the fence like me and a lot of misses then you might reconsider watching something that appeals to your humor/taste.  Don't get me wrong, I chuckled at parts and had a good laugh here or there but not enough in comparison to KonoSuba or Yuru Yuri for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, the main 4 fill in the typical 4 character archetypes.  The Baka-Chuuni Demon, the straight-women demon, the NEET angel, and the sadist angel.  Kind of wish they did something more with these characters but that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nArt for this show was consistent and top-notch, don't expect to see bad quality anywhere.  A lot of gifable moments and art.  The artists for this show did a good job here.\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm talking about art, the only fan-service is in the ED.  I can't recall any explicit fan-service anywhere else.  There was a beach episode and if seeing them there go ahead but it wasn't as in your face as the fan-service in the ED.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was meh for me, nothing stood out to me except for the OP and ED songs that was it.  It accomplished its job of accompanying the background and show, that could be all you ask for I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound was pretty good as it made the world feel more real.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to hear in-depth review with spoilers, I can link you a comment that accomplishes how I felt about the show perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I recommend for you to just take the few episodes a try.  If you love the show, you'll love the rest.  If you don't then I suggest with caution to be wary of your tastes and how willing you are to spend time on this show.",

            "content": "For a show about angels and demons, Gabriel DropOut is certainly on the lighthearted side of things. Usually, comedic shows like this tend to slightly drop in quality over their run, but Gabriel DropOut's humor actually got better and better as the show went on.\r\nStory-wise, the premise is certainly interesting; angels and demons experiencing life on Earth once they're a certain age, interacting with one another, becoming friends and losing a bit of their nature over time. Given that it's usually played for laughs and used for mostly self-contained jokes, it isn't developed a ton during the show. However, the main characters and their interactionswith one another being the point of the show means the story being alright is good enough!\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art, Gabriel DropOut is, at worst, solid. The visual gags are good, the main characters have good designs that really fit them, the animation is great! Moreover, the aesthetic of the show is super flexible, which not only helps the visual gags but also helps strike a difference between the main characters and between how characters should behave and how they actually act - for instance, accentuating Vigne's good nature and wholesomeness, contrasting it with the fact that she's a demon and throwing it in our face in a really funny way.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the soundtrack itself is fitting, if forgettable, while the OP and ED are catchy and likely to stick in a lot of people's minds. As for the sound design, it really helps sell the main characters' dumb antics; it's simply executed very well. The voice acting is top quality! They did an amazing job acting out every character's personality without going too far. In particular, Miyu Tomita playing Gabriel herself shows a lot of control, as Gabriel not only has her usual tone, but also the one she had prior to going to Earth, and they're both very convincing, yet both very representative of Gabriel. When Gabriel tries to go back to that old personality of hers, her performance also shows just a hint of insincerity, which helps sell the character a lot. There's such examples for every main character!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the main strength of Gabriel DropOut. The character dynamics between Gab, Vigne, Satania and Raphi are golden, and the character development as they get to know each other better was key to my enjoyment of the show. To be fair, Satania and Raphi didn't start out as great characters in my eyes, but the characters evolved and so did their dynamics, and I came to enjoy them just as much, if not more than the other two. Honestly, everyone in that quartet brings just as much to the show, and such a good balance feels great to have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is just plain funny. It started out a bit slow as it was introducing its characters, but once they're established, they take what they've established and run with it to create a really fun experience. The inside jokes slow down once they're established, and pop in just once in a while, which really helps the tone of the show. In the end, Gabriel DropOut really manages to make the best out of its premise, humor-wise, and I'd recommend it to anyone inclined to watch comedy anime!\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. - please let Satania have her melon bread.)",

            "content": "Ah, I guess it's time for Gabriel Dropout's judgement. I had fun watching this quirky anime, from its characters to the random scenarios that took place. \r\nStory: Gabriel Dropout has a simple story premise. Whatever events that occurred in the real world would be used in the story as a general idea. By using this, the events could be anything as long as it matched a certain time. This idea then transformed events that would combine to create one episode. However, some of the story events seemed a bit generic when thought about. There was your fanservicey beach episode, your \"I didn't study for theexams\" part, but for the most part the events seemed like new takes on existing events. Also, another part I'd like to address is the running gag in the story. Gabriel loves being an absolute douche to Satania, which is always fun to watch, and Raphi is the literal definition of a sadist, propelling her status as best girl. Vigne, on the other hand, is the straight man of the group and usually is seen trying to get the other 3 to actually be normal for once. Overall, these small gimmicks were used nicely in the story, and helped support the characters and story nicely.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Gabriel Dropout had some really good art. Its bright and vibrant colours helped accompany the story and characters, and sudden changes in colours also made certain scenes pop out. Whenever Satania would make her \"Lord of the Underworld\" speeches, the sudden change from light to dark colours allowed for scenes to work well and for us to maybe see what Satania envisions when she makes the speeches. Other features like glowing effects for angels allowed for some jokes, like when they were blinded by the principal's aura. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Besides having an opening full of discord and chaos, Gabriel Dropout also did a nice job at voices. Gabriel's 2 different forms are easily distinguishable, which allows for a nice touch to her character. Raphi always has a smile and sounds happy, which compliments her character when she goes all sadistic on Satania. Speaking of Satania, her voice was done the best in my opinion, with lots of personality and life put into her voice. This could be attributed to the fact that her eccentric personality could be in play. The last character I'll talk about is Satania's brother. Despite being a character who appears in one episode, his annoyance with the family was a funny and nice addition to the episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in Gabriel Dropout were what you expect from an anime of its kind. All start somewhere, and slowly show more of themselves throughout the anime, unless your name was Gabriel. Gabriel's character went through the most change, starting from a model student and angel and quickly turning into a hikomori whose goal had been lost to MMOs. Other characters like Raphi and Vigne showed us their true characters quickly too. Raphi was a closet sadist, enjoying it when Satania would be pushed around, and Vigne was the opposite of a demon. Characters overall didn't change much, but they didn't need to for this kind of anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Gabriel Dropout was a great experience like many others. It had vibrant visuals that kept my attention away from the more serious and darker tones used in other animes that came out in 2017, and also featured a cast of characters that I could kinda relate to. I related to all 4 main characters at some point in the story, which made enjoyment levels go up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Gabriel Dropout is not a perfect anime by all means, but it was a nice experience that showed that your core ideologies was what made your character. Story had parts that were somewhat generic but overall was new and fresh. Art was vibrant and appealing to the eye, and characters were relatable but didn't change much outside from revealing their inner traits. Overall, the anime was a nice addition to the lineup of animes that I watched in 2017.",

            "content": "Gabriel dropout was really one of my favorites in the Winter 2017 season. With an unconventional protagonist, scummy angels and very un-demonic demons, it really felt like something special to me. \r\nSTORY: Nothing solemn or serious here. Completely comedic and something that's perfect for someone looking for a feel-good thing to watch after a stressful day. Lighthearted, humorous with serious moments being present but very rare and in-between. 8/10\r\nCHARACTERS: A very strong aspect of this anime. There are very few characters besides the main four, but that's all the anime really needs because of how distinct and perfect the main four were. Gabriel, the veryopposite of what a female protagonist in these slice of life/school anime are usually like. Vignette, the 'straight-man' of the group. Satania, an utter failure who can be absolutely stupid sometimes but also be endearing as hell who somehow managed to become my favorite character. Raphi, the literal definition of an angelic sadist. They're all so distinct and each their own character that it's just a joy to see them be themselves on screen. 9/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: Nothing special or mind-blowing, but definitely nice. Character designs are great, and animation is fine, with some very good moments. 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Fantastic!! Each voice actress put their all into their role, and you can just tell they were having fun. Sometimes just the delivery of a certain line can make a joke hit 10000% more, that's how great the voice acting was. 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: This anime was something I eagerly looked forward to every week, and was disappointed when it ended and immediately took to reading the manga. It's something you can binge easily, with the light-hearted tone and comedy being just right with a great cast of main characters. Some people do complain about the jokes getting reptitive, and I do see that, but it didn't dampen my enjoyment at all and the joke still hit 90% of the time. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're into slice of life, cute girls doing cute things with dash of demons and angels and some great comedy, then I definitely recommend Gabriel dropout. It's still nice to go and rewatch episodes that stuck with me, and I'd be over the moon if they chose to do a season 2 :D 9/10",

            "content": "STORY\r\n\u200b     Gabriel is now graduated from Heaven's school above-world and must deepen her knowledge about human by seeing them firsthand to human world. As an angel, of course with angelic personality, she has a dream to become a great angel who will lead people to happiness. She is considered as the best alumnus, gained reputation as a worthy-of-being-a-role-model angel. When the time starts to rhyme with her new experience in human world, Gab\u2015short for Gabriel\u2015is exceptionally addicted to game in her PC. The MMORPG that she plays all the time, almost nonstop, is made excuses as the way to observe humanby learn it from human entertainment. Don't you think it's another game-like series, no, it's absolutely not! Gabriel DropOut surpasses it in terms of enjoyment and laughter.\\n\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\r\nSTORY IMPRESSION\\n\r\n      The concept of angels & demons is not special at all. We have so many of it especially in supernatural genre series. It goes along too with the slice-of-life theme, we have several series of it, namely The Devil is a Part-timer! as an example. Nonetheless, Gabriel DropOut brings something fresher and much more laughter as well as slice-of-life spice. When it's common to find male demon race, we won't be offered males, instead we get extraordinary demons with its uniqueness. Watch out! The angels aren't angelic at all and the demons aren't demonic at all. It's like fucking parody of reverse side of angel and demon race in regard to the personality. What's cute and enjoyable is the story...they enter schools, mingle in the human world, learn how to life like human (eating in cafetaria, learn cooking, summer break, part-time, partying). There are times when they get holiday in human world then visiting back their realm (heaven and hell). So funny futuristic upper realm with goodies there far from the expectation of mine where Heaven and Hell of them are such sacred places.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERIZATION\\n\r\n     A bit of its personality has been mentioned. In regard to personality, the major characters here, the angels and demons: Gab, Vigne, Satanichia, and Raphi are all like the opposite of their race reputation. They aren't represent the angel race as angels and demon race as demons at all. Gab and Raphi, one of the best students in Heaven, one of them is a fallen angel who's addicted to video game like trash lol and another one is actually corrupted with her hidden-yet-visible sadistic and mocking deeds. These two brings already uncountable laughter and added with the dunce demon, Satanichia, and angelic demon, Vigne. The demons are kinder than the angels itself and vice versa.\\n\r\n     Their friendship and characters development itself is good. Well, for friendship is great, because their ties as friends growing stronger. They try to help each other with their own (funny) way. There are several problems present and they manage to handle it together. Every character has their own problem even if it's not much illustrated. However, it's not a real big problem, just small one, that later involved all of them because they're friends OMG SO CUTE AND FUN LOL For additional information, we're also being given the background information about their lives both in Heaven and Hell at a glance too.\\n\r\n     The 4 main characters aren't easy to be bored. However, we still get some minor characters too. Like the angel junior named Tapris who's prone to get fooled and has a racism over satan race. Yet she is still so pure with virtue concept that makes her act inbetween to still act good and respective to goodness or do racism over good satan. We also got the class rep figure as the normal human. She is funny for being respectful to her responsibility, or it's as she thought she have to. But, she does it in an overly way she does it sometimes burdening herself of course that brings us laughter. Other minor like the major characters family members give us background information of what kind of environment the major were raised.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVISUALIZATION & MUSIC\\n\r\n      For the visualization, let's start from the characters design itself. Well, there's nothing fancy here but keep it mind that their simple design combines with the personalities and story will make them hard to forget and easy to make you fall in love. Blonde girls, red-haired rather devilish, an angelic looks from white-haired character, dark-haired as the most mature, it's common to find yet I really like them. The facial expressions are really well-animated and that's how the funny moments can reach its funniest state. The changing on their normal faces and its irritating expressions in an instant is like a grenade for lots of laugh. The visualization in broader sense to its surrounding makes use gradation of colour which makes it look smooth and boost the aura of characters. This aspect of Gabriel DropOut mixes well with the sound aspect in which the seiyuu(s) successfully encouraging the jokes. What's more the background music is really fit for this comedy genre.\\n\r\n\u200b     \u200bThe theme song itself for the OP \"Gabriel Drop Kick (\u30ac\u30f4\u30ea\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30ed\u30c3\u30d7\u30ad\u30c3\u30af)\" is sung by Miyu Tomita, Saori Oonishi, Naomi Oozora & Kana Hanazawa (the 4 major characters' seiyuus). ED \"Hallelujah\u2606Essaim (\u30cf\u30ec\u30eb\u30e4\u2606\u30a8\u30c3\u30b5\u30a4\u30e0)\" is also sung by them. The OP has catchy beats with bright colours as background. It's like they have conversation when singing with catchy beat. A mixing of pop and the drum beat like rock genre. What's best is the seiyuus' voices here. The ED is great too! The seiyuu(s) fill(s) the blank space perfectly without being annoying to the rhythm and it's clearly pump up the energy. Funny background scenes for ED soundtrack. The ED of Gabriel DropOut has many changes on tempo/beat like in Sabagebu!\\n\r\n\u200b     \u200b The background music when something is in tight situation or funny-comedy can change so sudden and it is impressive. It brings laughter and it never made me bored with this classic way. There are always no jokes and unpredictable things as outcome. The seiyuus are really into the characters, like when it's in the cornered situation, background music comes and passes, the seiyuus will voice up the characters both funny and interesting like \"how can you sound it out like that?!\".\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nTheme songs. I like the seiyuu(s) so much there!\\n\r\nDespite of common theme of angels and demons, the series delivers something new as a plot and the friendship of them growing up in an awesome way.\\n\r\nSo much fun and laughter by the jokes and the visualization.",

            "content": "Note: This is my very first review, as such, I will not be surprised if it is seen as garbage, or if I come to that conclusion in the future.\r\nPeoples' tastes in anime vary greatly--some enjoythought-provoking themes, some like their good-old ecchi harem light novel garbage, etc. Regardless, I am very sure there are times when we want to sit down, and watch something simple, fun, short, and maybe even a little unique in its own right.\r\nGabriel Dropout is one of those anime. While it may not have the brilliant comedic scenarios, visuals, and creativity like Konosuba, Gabriel Dropout has a level of charm toit--one where you will feel like you're hanging out with a bunch of friends and chilling--which is practically the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters:\\n\\n\r\nIn heaven, Gabriel White Tenma (better get used to the long names ASAP) graduates angel school at the top of her class. She is the ideal girl: short, cute, long haired, blonde, adorable, kind to an outrageously ridiculous degree. Basically, the average otaku's wet dream.\\n\r\nHer next job is to live in the human world, more specifically Japan, to study human society...which she would, if the anime's title wasn't Gabriel DROPOUT. Once Gabriel discovers the world of games online, she becomes the complete opposite of how she was initially presented as: Lazy, cynical, and sloppy, becoming an angel in race only. Now Gabriel wants nothing more than to sit around in her room all day playing games, eating potato chips, not take out the trash, and be an asshole to anyone whom she can't get any benefit from. And thus, the story follows her and her friends basically chilling out together in each ep, playing off of each others' quirky personalities, helping each other, or just being straight-up assholes.\\n\r\nFucking. Brilliant.\\n\r\nI am a massive sucker for cute anime girls and assholes in comedies, and Gabriel fits both bills perfectly. The way she only is active if it involves something of benefit to her (food, games, or even getting to be an asshole), her bored cynical attitude towards life, makes her perfect as a loveable asshole who never comes off as too mean, as she still shows care towards her friends, and isn't an asshole 24/7. Unfortunately, however, despite Gabriel being \\n\r\nNext up are Gabriel's other friends in this group of loveable idiots and assholes: \\n\\n\r\nVignette April Tsukinose: a demon who is, ironically, the nicest character in the entire anime. The literal opposite of Gabriel. Kind, earnest, the loveable straight man (technically girl, but whatever) of the group. \\n\\n\r\nSatanichia McDowell Kurumizawa (what the hell was the writer on when coming up with these names?): a demon who wants to become queen of hell, but whose only idea of evil are minor things like keeping a pencil cap on. The most outgoing and egotistic of the whole group. Despite this, she is the 2nd kindest of the entire group.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, my favorite of the 4, Raphiel Ainsworth Shiraha, an angel who appears more reserved on the outside, but in fact, loves tease and prank others for her own amusement, taking advantage of Satanichia's ego and stupidity for all sorts of entertaining scenarios, like having a dog steal her food literally on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nYou most likely have noticed a pattern among the characters by now: the angels are assholes, while the demons are pretty nice. The anime also notes this contrast, as several times whenever a character would do something bad to another, they would yell, \"you demon!\" and be replied with, \"I'm an angel\", or, \"of course I'm a demon!\". The anime could've easily explored the psychological states of angels and demons and question whether one is inherently evil or not, but this contrast is used purely for comedic effect. \\n\r\nIn every ep, the characters try to do something ordinary, whether it be going to the beach, celebrating Christmas, and so on. The comedy comes from, again, how every character bounces off each other and complicate matters, whether it's the entire cast trying to get Gabriel to come to the beach by allowing her to hit Satanichia's head, or trying to make Satanichia forget that Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ, just so they can properly party. Despite their misfits, the cast never comes off as mean spirited, as they still help and care for each other in the end, whether it be Vignette allowing Gabriel to look at her homework because the latter is too lazy, or everyone trying to help Satanichia be able to keep a dog. Regardless, every ep plays out extremely simple. This results in a feeling of genuine friendship and chill-backness that even a hardcore fan of dark and thought-provoking anime like I crave for once in a while. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, the formula's execution is nothing to really write home about. Every ep is basically just the characters kinda messing around and playing off of each other, but there are more than one of these kinds of scenarios, in a single ep, meaning that one ep would have, say, Vignette trying to learn to act like a demon, and then a scenario where the characters are trying to study for exams. Which sounds great on paper, but the execution is lackluster. Because these multiple scenarios fail to establish any connection with each other during the 1st ep, and sometimes are even quickly forgotten, like the one where Vignette tries to become more demon-like that I had mentioned. This way, there are almost no build-up jokes, or cause-and-effect for a bigger joke like you'd find in Konosuba, where almost every ep starts off relatively small before bombarding with wide-scale hilarity by the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all there is to really say about the writing of Gabriel Dropout. The characters, while entertaining and fun, never really show any unexpected traits beyond how they are initially introduced. Sure, Gabriel shows from time to time to NOT be an asshole, Raphiel even has moments where she is the LEAST controlling of the group, but those are only tiny moments--nothing really more. Maybe the cast would be entertaining if there were more major characters beyond the main 4 to help keep things more fresh and unpredictable, but there aren't. Like I said earlier, this anime is like being with a bunch of dumb friends and chilling out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals:\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are actually noteworthy. The character designs are fantastic--Gabriel's long messy hair when she becomes, \"fallen\" creates a great contrast towards her former pure self, the fact that she barely wears pants at her apartment helps sell the fact that she's a slob, and her short height is stereotypical of more cynical characters. As a result, Gabriel certainly looks cute and slobbish at the same time, the conrast making her design the most memorable.\\n\r\nVignette's short blue-purple-ish hair shows her to be a youthful but calm girl, and the small bun sticking from the back of her head is a detail that is very rare in anime.\\n\r\nSatanichia reddish-brown hair, which has a bat-like bow on her forehead, along with her hair loops on both sides of her head make her look like a girl trying to look, \"cool\"--which is exactly who she is.\\n\r\nRaphiel's is definitely the 2nd most interesting design. Her long white hair, along with the crosses hanging on her forehead make her appear extremely pure, when she's the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the comedic scenes, the characters' exaggerated facial expressions are nothing to write write home about--the same old comedic faces you see in almost any comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the background setting may be what truly bogs down Gabriel Dropout from truly succeeding as a memorable slice-of-life-esque comedy. The main location used in the anime is the high school the characters go to, which looks completely generic and cookie-cutter. If you've seen almost ANY high school anime, it looks like a copy and paste of that one. Thankfully though, the background characters are actually very detailed, having distinct hairstyles to make them stand out and give more life to the setting. The other settings used throughout the anime are the girls' apartments that they live in. None of these settings are used as a way for characters to truly interact with, making many of the scenarios a lot less entertaining than they actually are. Thankfully though, the setting does switch up and is actually used in certain episodes, such as the Christmas ep where the cast walks to a shrine, or hang out to celebrate Christmas by making a cake, and of course, the beach episode.\\n\r\nEven so, however, there is barely any variation. Take Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon, another slice-of-life, chill-back series: Every ep almost always takes place in different location where characters really interact with their environment--whether it be Kobayashi's apartment where the cast makes food, the market, the office where Kobayashi has trouble with her boss. In comparison, Gabriel Dropout's use of setting comes off as incredibly lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nGabriel Dropout is definitely worth watching, if you simply want to have a nice time where you don't have to think hard about anything. Though, I doubt it will be earn the title \"anime of the season/year\" by anyone.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gabriel Dropout is the lastest addition to the slice of life subgenre known as Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (CGDCT for short) this time the latest spin is that the main cast of girls are angels and demons sent from their respective locations to attend a human school together, because of training(?) i think. Anyway the show mostly boils down to the girls doing random normal human things but from the perspective from an angle or demon, but it's not much since it seems they can so these tasks like any other human so no new perspective is actually gained. there's no real \"plot\" inthe story other than for the introductions of new characters and their interactions among each other. the show is mostly about the girls and how they react to given situation, people environments,and each other which can lead to some gigles, but is mostly hit or miss.there's kind of a climax at the end of the show, but it's resolved and everything goes back to status quo and the girls continue to live out their lives in the human world\\n\\n\r\n the characters in the story aren't much. the main cast is composed of mostly angles and demons that are given a twist to what you would think an angle or demon would be. Gabriel is a well beloved angle in heaven who gets sent to earth only to be \"corrupted\" by the wonders of technology that she becomes a neet as well as a fallen angle.Gabriel is pretty much the opposite of what would you think an angle would be she's foul mouth, brash, mean spirited, lazy, and would rather take the easy way out such as using her angelic powers to get her own way. she still at times presents herself well to certain people, but it's mostly as a farce to hide her true self. even then she's still a kind person deep down who cares for her \"friends\".\\n\\n\r\nvignette is a demon and is the neighbor of Gabriel and just so happens to be the opposite of Gabriel however with the added fact that she has always been this way. she is a contradiction of what a demon would be she doesn't lie,cheat, steal, or even ditch class. she's a kind person who is willing to help her friends in need, and acts more mature compared to the others in the group. yet even so, she still has her demonic tendencies mostly because she is bossy and doesn;t like it when people disrupt her plans.\\n\\n\r\nSatania is a another demon, and is pretty much the character who steals the show for me. she's is the only one who acts her part or at least she tries to, as she is very incompetent and is more egotistical who barks more than she bites. she's the one who boasts about her evil deeds but are very small scale such as not doing her homework, and her plans to conquer her homework which is never going to happen, and how she is above everyone else, but is submissive and gullible.most of the funniest things that happen in the show are mostly centered around her and how she tries to pull of a overpowering apperance in the most ridiculous circumstance, and once you see her family situation it's really a pay off\\n\\n\r\nRaphi is another angle in the show and is similar to Satania in the sense of them acting how they should be. she has a very nice and caring demeanor, but on the inside is a very sadistic person. She likes to tease Satania and just overall enjoys seeing people suffer, but mostly for santania because it gets the most kicks out of her.\\n\r\n the rest of the cast isn't really worth writing about since you already get an idea of who they are when they are introduced on screen. overall the characters may not be the most well written,but they get the job done\\n\\n\r\nthe art is decent to say the least the girls in the show look really cute, and you can tell a lot about them from the way they look. the background is just contemporary japan with not much going about. the art style does change for some comedic moments and it works decently for the show. the animation isn't much for a show with not much happening.\\n\\n\r\nthe voice actor/ess in the show did a good job in the show really capturing the personality of each character. The soundtrack was also rather decent as well, filling the mood when needed, but some of it is forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nit was a OK show to watch, but what mostly kept me to continue watching was the antics that santania got herself into. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- It's decent for a CGDCT show, but not much to make it stand out from the rest.",

And from this anime cover I thought that this will be the usual anime with cute girls just doing cute things... But im a fan of comedy and I give this anime a shot and I gotta admit that every episode I keep smiling or laughing and this anime is quite enjoyable.. The main character gabriel is afallen angel and quite annoying with her b*tchy attitude,spoiled and a useless b*tch that just playing game,idiot,egoistic and just spent all her money for nothing but for her game she's doesnt care about her friends or surroundings... but the rest of characters are quite likeable so its fine...This is one of the funniest anime ive ever seen... So if you like comedy then you will not disappointed with this anime...",

Gabriel Dropout is one of million anime with moe girls as main character and daily life as school girl as the setting. Is it worth watching ?\r\n1. Story\r\nSo, it's about an angel, graduate from her school in heaven, they will study in human's world just for learning about human. It's for joke, i'm understand. Then you have some devil girl to studying too. And you have some moe girls from heaven and hell to join your daily life of the school.\r\nWhat's the story ? I already mention it above.What else ? Just them doing fun in human's world. I have no problem to watch this kind of story, but Gabriel Dropout seems so boring to watch. The jokes is not funny at all, i'm even have a flat expression watching 12 episodes of this series.The story was not develop into something that interesting, just your usual CGDCT anime with some halloween, christmas theme, and happy new year, plus you never forget about school festival. The different just ... they are angels and devils. That's all.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art and animation\\n\\n\r\nIt's good, the only aspect i enjoy from this series. One of the better art and animation from any anime this season.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening song was ... cringeworthy. They're trying so hard to make it fun but fail (maybe it's just me for this one). The ending song was kinda good but not memorable. \\n\\n\r\n4. Character\\n\\n\r\nWell, character doesn't much help this anime at all. Gabriel was lazy girl, getting joke about failed angel. The look and mannerism, didn't try to do some favor to me. It's generic. Then you have Satania, the cute devil that some otaku here love. She kinda chuuni but then she was stupid idiot. We love this type of character. The only character i care from this series is Vignette, the natural babyface who choose wrong side as devil. All of that is Raphiel, the sadistic angel who always laugh at everything. I'm sorry to write this aspect kinda harsh, I'm sorry.\\n\\n\r\nI still keep following this anime to watch it with my younger sister. But i don't have any enjoyable moment watching this series. It's have nice and good visual, i don't have any problem with that aspect. But the comedy itself need so much improvement and upgrade if they want to make Season 2 of this anime which i doubt it.",

            "content": "Gabriel DropOut is just one of those many shows that are not to be taken too seriously, or rather It doesn't want to be taken seriously. The creators intentions are easy to read. It just wants some commercial appeal and it wants the audience to just lay back and have some fun. But that is where the anime kinda fell flat. When you're not offering much and whatever you're offering is quite underwhelming I don't really have much to take either.\r\nThe anime is about angels and demons being sent to Earth to learn about Humans and their life. There isn't a compelling story or anything.It revolves around 4 characters: Gabriel and Raphiel who are the angels, Satanichia and Vignette who are demons. These characters could be a hit or a miss. Their personalities could come off as either cute or annoying, Personally, I have mixed opinions about them. They carry the plot but the way they are written is too lazy and inconsistent, I didn't wanna say that for an anime like this but that's just how bad it is. Normally I would give a pass but this really bugged me. Nothing is very genuine or creative, it's just forced.    \\n\\n\r\nThe main character Gabriel becomes a fallen angel, Her care free and lazy attitude is exhausting to watch. It doesn't make me laugh, it makes me lazy lol. Similarly for Satanichia who is actually one of the more likable characters. Her narcissistic attitude is funny but she is used as a really dumb person to just convey a joke, her stupidity doesn't make laugh, it makes me sad...and sometimes cringe. There have been shows which have attempted this and I thought did it well like \"Himuto! Umaru chan\", There was always a charm and Hilarity about Himouto's laziness that I didn't get from this show or something like \"Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu\" where they made clever use of Idiocy. These are shows that share similar ambitions with Gabriel DropOut but they actually do a pretty good job. It's sad cause Gabriel DropOut could maybe, be put in that category if there was more effort put into it. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent. Nothing extraordinary but it has good detail and I appreciate the variety of Colors used. It does well to bring out the lighthearted atmosphere and the urban setting. The character designs are pretty decent too. The soundtrack is nothing special, I guess it does the job but there nothing for me to really appreciate about it. The OP and ED are just alright. \\n\\n\r\nI don't wanna be harsh on this anime but at the same time I can't really give it a pass either. At the end of the day, This is not something I would recommend or not recommend. If you want to watch it, go ahead. If you don't, you're not really missing out on anything. Even with it's glaring flaws, Gabriel DropOut is overall a pretty okayish anime with some good moments here and there. I'd give this a 5/10.",

            "content": "I was quite let down by this show to be honest. It's attempts to be subversive basically boil down to: \"Oh, you thought this was the case? WRONG. now laugh at it and be merry.\" Which can work for some people, but I can't even call it a \"cute girls doing cute things\" show in good conscience. The show poses itself as a comedy, but I only managed to laugh every now and then. It was funny enough to keep my attention, but that's about it. Let's look at the numbers:\r\nStory 3/10\r\nThis is a story that very loudly and busily goes nowhere. There's no plotto speak of outside of \"Just tryin' to survive in this crazy world.\" There's so little substance that I have nothing left to say except that the story does what it has to with whatever contrivance is necessary. There is one more thing I need to mention, but I don't think I will put it here.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nHere is where I'll give the show its solitary gold star. The character designs are appealing and appropriately kawaii. The art is consistent with good variation to convey emotion. I especially liked their \"freak out\" faces. Where the eyes are just circles with dots on a moe blob, etcetera.Very cute and appropriate for their situations. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nAnd I think that's being generous, but that's just my opinion. The characters are varied enough to be entertaining, but never evolves past that. This is also where one of my bigger issues comes up with the show's \"comedy.\" A big part of the comedy that the show attempts revolves around the main girls' misfit personalities: the shut-in angel, the sadistic angel, the demon who acts like an angel, and the demon who is all bark and no bite because of her stupidity.\\n\r\nThese characteristics are constantly played up for laughs, using the same gags ad nauseam. A recurring gag can be fun, but how many times can you laugh at a dog appearing out of nowhere to steal Satania's bread? They did try to explain that a little, having Raphiel (the sadistic angel) constantly encouraging the dog, but that doesn't keep it from becoming tedious.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also zero character development. Sure there were a few moments when characters showed a bit more character than their tropes, but still no-one changed, or grew, or learned anything after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI think what offends me the most about these characters is that they're never adequately explained. Why do the angels go to earth? To learn about humans and \"help people.\" Why do the demons go to earth? To....perform demonic deeds? To conquer the world? If either of those are true, then what is Vignette's purpose for being there?(the demon who acts like an angel) How does she feel about demons always being the \"bad guy?\"\\n\r\nMotivations and goals are so vague that they are meaningless. This is a just comedy show, right? who cares?..... I do.\\n\r\nA good comedy show is one that uses downtime to flesh out the world or characters and let your stomach rest between laughs. Take \"Nanbaka\" for example. It actively says multiple times that it's just a gag show and nothing more, but still takes its characters seriously enough to give them some background so that the jokes hit even harder.\\n\r\n The \"downtime\" in this show is just a thin veneer used to set up the next punchline. It works well enough though, I laughed a few times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nThis next paragraph should probably go under the \"story\" section, but this was one of the biggest things that ruined the show for me.\\n\r\nAs mentioned, there was never any true goal given for the angels and demons as a whole, but even worse was the relationship between Heaven and Hell. Nothing is explained, leaving only previous knowledge of the two places from religion to say anything about them, which does not work in their favor. \\n\\n\r\nIn the episode where the characters went home to their respective realms, they were right next door to each other, separated only by a fork in the road and a layer of black shadow over Hell's entrance. I understand that the real war between Heaven and Hell is too dark for a comedy show, but this is just ignorant. If you don't want to mirror the original places, then give us another reason that Heaven and Hell hate each other. They're treated as nothing more than rival countries trying to stake a claim on the human world without clarification. This means that anything goes in terms of interactions between the residents of the two places, characterized most fully by the fact that the main character (the shut-in angel) screams \"GD\", the most blasphemous curse word of them all, at the entrance to Heaven's gates and suffers zero consequences. It is never mentioned again. Was that supposed to be a subversive joke? That angels aren't supposed to do that but she did anyway?\\n\\n\r\nThis might have something to do with Japan's outsider point of view in terms of Christianity itself. Christmas is nothing more than a foil to Halloween in Japan anyway, so let's just have fun with the setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gabriel Dropout was a cute little time-filler. It's like eating handfuls of sugar, it tastes good at first, but isn't really worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOn a personal note, I demand a little more substance to my anime. I can respect a show that just wants to be a comedy, but the characters are the only thing to carry a show with no story, which means they need something more to them than just generic tropes. If none of these things bother you, then it's just fun little show that keeps the status quo.",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nThe anatomy and proportions checked out. There were plenty of neat-looking environmentals and panoramics that added to their universe. There were plenty of showcases of heaven and hell that expanded their universe and made it more interesting. The overall art style was a bit more cute and modern. There weren't too many impact shots and neither did any of the ones that did appear look too crazy. There was a lot of detail in quite a few things such as the backgrounds and extras. The details in the characters was also pretty clean and crisp. \r\nAnimation: 6/10\r\nThe animation,like the art, was mostly just fine. There were maybe two or three cases where there was reused animation such as the city-destruction imagery as well as the panty teleportation bit. Other than that, there wasn't too many noticeable shortcuts that were taken. I did really like some of the subtle impact sequences as well as some of the motions that clearly had more frames added to them. Some of the mannerisms and expressions received some clean and fluid animations which I also appreciate as it made them a bit more lively. Overall though, the animation is pretty average for a SoL-CGDCT type of show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters were fine too. Honestly Satania made the entire show. The voice of reason devil girl supporting the can't be bothered MC is a pretty common trope and the way this show did their dynamics is nothing new. Raphiel's presence was a bit weak, but she had her moments. There wasn't much character development to note because Gabriel pretty much stayed the same Gabriel, excluding her initial change into a geek, throughout the whole show. I did like how Satania progressively started to find friends in Gabriel and co. Vignette also stayed almost the same and saw no meaningful changes throughout the show. The introduction of Gabriel's sister was a bit boring as the older sister was pretty much introduced to segue into another common scenario in shows like this: the battle for the MC's ability to stay with his/her friends either physically or mentally. Gabriel is faced with her older sister who more or less threatens to sever Gabriel's ties with the human world and as a result her friends who she had built up relationships with throughout the show. Another anime that uses this setup in a similar way was the time travel episode finale thing in Yuru Yuri. Overall though, the dynamics between the characters (particularly the ones that included Satania) were fun and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\r\nThe initial plot setup was interesting. I figured the show was just another cgdct, but that was fine. The interesting plot setup was enough to hook me.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 5/10\\n\r\nThe development ended up being a bit underwhelming by the end of the show. What really happened by the end of the show? Nothing much in terms of plot development or character development actually. Gabriel was the exact same Gabriel. Vignette, Raphiel, and Satania were the same too. I disliked how Gabriel at the end of the fooling the sister debacle pretty much said something along the lines of, \"Aha! I won't change!\"...something pretty much like that. The introduction of the kouhai angel girl was also sort of just there to fill in time I guess. I would have liked to see more interactions and inclusions of heaven and hell. Overall the development was standard for a cgdct show. The only parts I genuinely enjoyed were the parts that had Satania in it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nThe bgm music wasn't too catching. I thought the OP and ED were a bit catchy though. There was no sound design to bring up. The soundboard was average too. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10\\n\r\nThe conclusion was typical for many cgdct shows. Ultimately there wasn't any major plot or character developments in the entirety of the show. Character dynamics mostly stayed static for a majority of the show and the conclusion was open-ended pushing towards the same dynamics continuing indefinitely. The conclusion was fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThere was a lot of hype for this show around its time so I decided to pick it up. Its just an average cgdgt show when it comes down to it. The standout for this show and honestly the only reason worth watching it is for Satania. Satania is really entertaining.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nThe concept of this Anime is pretty interesting. Angels and Devils going through education on earth with humans.\r\nAside that it's slice-of-life comedy. Where daily things happen with some character introduction and development.\r\nMy main problem with was the thematic. Whole bullying and being annoying type of comedy isn't exactly my cup of tea. Also I didn't like characters, which I will mention in characters section. And \"comedy\" was off-mark for me.\r\nFor genres as they are it works pretty well. Plus interesting concept is a great addition. In anotherwords so called \"story\" is solid enough.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nVery satisfying visuals and plenty of great facial expressions.\\n\r\nSame story with music. I found it pretty good.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nTo put it simply, I essentially disliked or hated every character.\\n\r\nGabriel is a very obnoxious bully. I felt sorry for Satan but as well her stupidity I found quite annoying and tedious.\\n\\n\r\nIn those 5 episodes only two characters were characters I can say I \"liked\". One being Tapris and another and probably primary one would be Vignette.\\n\\n\r\nAside that characters were not simply my cup of tea and they did not make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nWhat can I add. I've experienced enough bullying for fairly large portion of life. Thus I cannot comprehend enjoying someones else intentionally caused discomfort and pain. If someone has gone through bullying, then I understand if they developed some sort of revenge complex, which doesn't make them any better but at least it's sort of a excuse. If bully never experienced him/herself bullying, but enjoys bullying others, then that person I simply consider hypocrite. Or essentially \u201cThe only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story is that I did not enjoy this Anime simply because of the characters and I did not find that comedy being funny at all nor liked character interactions.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically it's very \"off target\" Anime for me. Thus I don't like it.\\n\r\nBest part about this Anime was art, facial expressions and OST.\\n",

            "content": "How would I describe this show in one word? Boring.\r\nIt's got the aesthetics down as is clear for all to see and it appears to have thrown out a lot of meme fodder as demonstrated by the sheer volume of short GIF's floating around the web. But those very GIF's that look funny and cute are essentially all of the show's highlights as everything else in between is just... well, boring.\r\nThe premise starts off interesting enough, angel's in heaven have an angel school which after graduating leads those young angels into some field/research work on Earth, starting with a human school. Seems to have alot of promise since there are so many avenues to take such a concept. The MC discovers a very human vice on arrival to earth and \"falls from grace\" as she shirks her responsibilities to fuel this addiction. What happens after this? Well, besides the introduction of other characters including an angel who's a trickster, a Demon of equal and opposite intent to the MC (kind and responsible) and an incompetent arch demon (none of which are original concepts in this contemporary age of parody and satire), the rest is all a series of predictable slap stick jokes carried entirely by the shows cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the plot throwing these characters into the human world in order to learn about them, there's actually next to no interaction with any of them [humans]. The show limiting itself to just these 4 characters and a few support, which is really the first flag you'll notice that suggests this show is not only cheap, but will never be anything more than what you have already seen in the opening episodes. Which amounts to the two angels bullying the 2 demons for shits and giggles. Sadly, the jokes aren't even that good.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show was created years ago i might have forgiven it for at least being somewhat clever for its subversion of the good vs evil meta. But even that's been done before, as far back as the 1970's with shows like Monty Python's \"Life of Brian\", etc.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose this show is a prime example of how we should never judge a book by its cover. Because both the show's characters and premise were quite enticing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off interesting enough before stagnating any kind of development, running entirely off of tired and predictable slap stick humour, offering nothing but the vapid and vacuous level of satisfaction that comes with observing something cute.",

            "content": "Gambriel DropOut has tons of charm and bouncy expressive animation style that helps sell it's comedy. Episodes are clear cut into sitcom like skits each of which you can really tell are just self contained chapters. So in that sense there's not a great thru line each episode, which is fine because great comedies have done that before. But that's just the thing; comedy shows that feel just like this have been done before, better, and by the same studio no less. \r\nThe premise is fun but just an excuse to have off-beat quirky characters that don't really feel like the belong in this worldto go through that all so familiar joke of \"So this is how the human world works? Facinating!\". Not every character is unique or is as funny as Satania (the most amusing character in the show) and not every plot point makes complete sense. Our main \"hero\" once a sunny and positive angel gets addicted to video games and the Umaru-chan lifestyle by noticing on MMO on her laptop that she's never seen before? HUH? Then how was it running on her laptop? How does that happen? The weirdness of this plot point is not even played for laughs. \\n\\n\r\nThat aside there are enough funny cuts and comedic timing that sells this comedy show well, if you're okay with some mean-spirited humor here and there. And if you're new to this sub-genre you could probably expect to enjoy it much more than the average viewer.",
