            "content": "War.  It's a grueling way to help your country.  The lives of several thousand men sacrificed to help benefit one country's benefits.  You hear about all the sorts of things wars have, but have you really understood the inner workings and tactical strategies?  Well, that's where Madan no Ou to Vandis comes in.  Let's take aim!\r\nStory (6.00/10): The story of Vanadis follows from the perspective or Tigrevurund Vorn, or Tigre.  On a battlefield one day, amidst the corpses of his fallen comrades, he takes aim at a woman riding on a horse, a war maiden, who has just demolishedhis whole army.  After taking aim, he tries to shoot her down, only to become captive to Elenora, as she is called.  Sending the two of them into a spiraling journey as tensions rise between their two countries.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story basically sums up to following these two characters as they try and fight through a war, with each battle being a new battle and event in the ever going war, with each battle being a battle with usually a different opponent and progressing through their goals to fight and come victorious.  The show gets props for deconstructing the idea of war by making every little event become crucial to the character's goals and ideals.  There are however, some big flaws with this series, mostly with its execution and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution for the series wavers heavily, with some parts being rather well written, while other parts are written rather poorly.  This problem is heavily shown in the transitions from one scene to another.  Vanadis...has probably one of the worst scene transitions in anime period.  The show constantly changes from scene to scene, and sometimes even changes the scene completely, leaving the audience dazed and confused as to what exactly is going on.  In addition, the world of Vanadis is a very interesting place, talking about its lore and legends in some of its episodes such as the dragon gear and the goddesses in the realm.  However, the show doesn't give you an opportunity to fully enjoy the show at all because they don't give enough explanation to the show's basic lore, which really takes away from an otherwise fantastic show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show's pacing is just awful.  You don't get enough time to truly enjoy anything in the show, and you really don't have the chance to let the current scenario sink in.  Mostly, the show just pokes in at a specific scene, than goes off to somewhere else without word or warning.  The pacing really does take a lot of the show's credibility away because it rushes through its own story so much that you can't enjoy it very much  (This really only applies beyond the first three episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Vanadis had a lot of potential.  It showed us the prospects of war and the sheer amount of strategy and thinking that goes into it, but that's all it really does.  You don't really get any semblance as to what the world of Vanadis, which really is a shame due to how well that could've worked conjunction into the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great story concept  (the deconstruction of war that is)\\n\r\n-  Untold world\\n\r\n-  Awful pacing\\n\r\n-  Very poor execution\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.00/10): In addition, the characters of Vanadis share a same downfall similar to the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Tigrevurund Vorn, the main protagonist of this series, as well as an archer that would put Katniss Everdeen to shame.  As the count of Alsace, the and of his birth, Tigre is caught by the war maiden Elen, and becomes her captive in her principality.  From then on, Tigre asks his capturerer to help protect his homeland, and eventually gets the opportunity to do so.  As the series goes on, you can see his development beyond his simple goal of protecting his homeland as he meets new characters that aid him along his journey.  Beyond that, though, you really don't know very much about him.  He has this weapon and lineage that you basically know nothing about, and only a small bit of his personality really comes out.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Elenora, the war maiden of the series.  In Vanadis, we have individuals called war maidens, women who have been chosen by a dragon gear, a weapon with special abilities and power, all of which have control over their own principalities and people.  Elen is an interesting character.  A bit of a jokester, (and maybe a little bit perverted), Elen helps Tigre on his quest to help his people in exchange for power over his land.  In the story, you get some details as to what kind of women she was before, and the connections she has between some characters, but you don't really get to learn about her very much.  She's an interesting character that has no details put in, which really makes the show a bit disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, we have constant characters that you see, such as Lim, Titta, Ludmila, and a few others, and then you have those characters that you don't really see at all, or get introduced at one point, before going away.  The supporting cast, are basically a mystery since you don't actually get to see or know a lot of them since most of them REALLY only serve as plot devices in order to move the story along.  This even includes the main villain of the story, Duke Thernardier, who supposedly is the one corrupting the country for his own purpose, but is a character you don't really see or know about since he shows his face only in the last two episodes, and even then, it's freaking disappointing.  This also brings me to another point, which are the seven war maidens.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Vanadis, there are seven war maidens that exist in the lands, all of them holding a specific dragon gear.  From the title art, and the opening, you'd expect to see them all at some point, right?  Wrong.  The series establishes that there are seven war maidens, but you really only get to know two out of seven of the war maidens.  Most of them you don't even get to meet or know the names of, which just shows how much potential this show had, but failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting main cast\\n\r\n-  Little to no detail for the characters you see or learn about\\n\r\n-  Plot devices as the supporting cast\\n\r\n-  War maidens not utilized though established\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.11/10 and 8.88/10):  The art for the series is what I regard as high quality.  The artwork for the series is stunning and beautiful, accurately demonstrating a medieval war zone of sorts with its massive armor clad armies and detailed country banners held high.  In addition, the character designs displayed are for the most part, very well done.  The armors from the different bad guys, as well as the sword designs, and for the war maidens are very well done, with detail definitely not lacking from one scene to the other.  However, the animation is, like everything else in this series, a double-edged sword.  \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the stunning animation, there also exists the 3-D, which...ah...sucks.  The series at times goes into a sort of planning board in order to accurately describe the thought processes of either side's strategists, using little dioramas of little figures to represent and describe what is going on.  This is a plus for the series for those who don't fully understand what is going on and adds to the concept of war that this show excels at telling.  However, the little figures used look very, very bad on account of the awful 3-D animation that constantly plagues this series, since they use the diorama constantly.  Plus, they also make whole armies in 3-D sometimes, and it just does not look good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is an ecchi show, time to talk about the ecchi.  To be honest, I was very surprised.  The ecchi in this show is all but non-existent, mostly existing solely in the designs of its war maidens  (since pretty much all of the war maidens have breasts that make you wonder how they can function in battle, and the only one with the normal-sized chest is considered flat.  -.-)  Apart from their questionable battlewear, there really isn't much ecchi in this show.  Sure you have like three bath scenes in this show, and a couple accidental boob grabs, but that's basically it.  Hell, you'd find more ecchi in a romantic comedy show that's not tagged ecchi that in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, well, a little word.  As long as there is at least one VERY memorable track in the soundtrack, the show gets decent high marks for the sound category.  Vanadis succeeds this by giving us its opening.  (Just listen to it.)  The heroic and grand sound of Vanadis's opening literally gave me shivers when I first heard it, and has become one of my favorite tracks since.  The loud fanfare, the triumphant tone of going to war and returning a hero; it fits the show so well that I could cry.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the rest of the show's soundtrack I would consider to be good, but not as memorable as the opening song.  They all have a very similar flair of mixing medieval sounds and heroic voices, but nothing I could hear held a candle to the opening.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good normal animation\\n\r\n+  DAT OPENING\\n\r\n-   Awful 3-D animation\\n\r\n-   Rest of the soundtrack was meh\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.00/10):  So, at the end of the day, what are my feelings about this show?  I've stated before that this show is its own enemy, it's own double-edged sword.  The show is interesting and grand, but doesn't really deliver with its execution.  The characters are interesting, but there wasn't enough detail to them that really made them more real and three-dimensional.  The art was good in one sense, and awful in another.  And the music had a fantastic opening, and the rest of the tracks sorta lagged behind.  I guess I could say that Vanadis was an interesting show for me to watch, in which I looked forward to every episode week after week.\\n\\n\r\nDId I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes, absolutely.  Regardless of its flaws, Vanadis enthralled me with its use of military tactics and really brought the idea of the battlefield in animated form.  It succeeded very well in that regard and portrayed an entire war in the span of its runtime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe show had its fair share of problems in basically every category.  As for personal dislikes, I felt as though many scenes shown in the show were handled so poorly that they shouldn't have even bothered to put it in.  Some characters seemed virtually pointless, and the show attempted to make a character death seem more important than it actually was.  I didn't really feel anything on account of the hoards of other characters that shared as much plot importance as the one that died, not to mention I honestly didn't really know his name cause he didn't really show up very often.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nFor strategists and fans of war and boobs, go ahead, go wild.  The show does have its perks, with its stunning character designs and war strategies sprinkled in every single episode to make the core part of the show thriving and well.  While it does this, it neglects its other parts such as building the world and its characters.  So, if you don't mind somewhat one-dimensional characters or a world that you really won't get to know, then this will be a good watch for you.  \\n\\n\r\nAuthor's note:  I still don't fully understand how Elen can function on the battlefield.  Those things must weigh a ton.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.20/10",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWar, when diminished to its base components, is sadly tragic. It's hard to justify the killings of thousands of people for any kind of cause. But some are better than others: bringing about peace, saving a subjugated group, or protecting one's home. For as long as humans have lived, war has not only shaped the past, has not only persisted in the present, but will most likely never dwindle in the future. An almost inevitability, war brings out the best and the worst in people. For Madan no Ou to Vanadis, it certainly brings out the worst insomething.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nVanadis begins with the bowman Tigre meeting Elen, a War Maiden, on the battlefield. After being taken hostage, the two decide to help one another in protecting Tigre's hometown of Alsace.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the show is about war: the battles, the aftereffects, the planning, and the formations. And to this end, it fails miserably. A lot of this has to do with the world-building it attempts to employ. Country names, nearby towns, and faraway lands are talked about as if the audience is supposed to simply know that such areas exist. It disconnects the viewer from what is going on, because he or she just cannot follow who's from where, which side is fighting what, and why they're all fighting in the first place. Simultaneously, multiple sub-plots exist at any given moment, such as Elen's trek to visit Sasha or the King's madness. The aforementioned difficulty in understanding what is going on persists here as well. Since it wasn't explained properly before, it remains discombobulated after.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actual field skirmishes, the anime adopts a narration approach. Going into explanatory mode, the show does its best to clarify the formations of the warring sides and their plan of attack. The point here is to make it feel as if it's a war that the characters are participating in. Again, though, it falls flat: the majority of the action focuses not on the entire battle, but on the singular duels taking place. Elen fighting against a dragon or Tigre squaring off against the opposing general are fine as standalone fights. In context, though, it doesn't seem to fit since their part is just one small piece to the much bigger puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime isn't having such a tough job conveying the severity of the wars going on, it steps back into its secondary role as a harem. Once again, though, the anime cannot deliver. A lot of the problems here stem from the show refusing to address or at least elaborate on the relationships that exist between Tigre and the rest of the girls. It's alluded to heavily for each of them, with constant teasing and wordplay, but it never comes off as if the characters are anything but friends to our main character. What's even more strange is the apparent lack of the harem. Particular characters are sometimes shown only once or twice, despite given relative importance. Worse still, there exists a person shown in the opening and closing sequences, but never appears over the course of the show. It's almost as if the anime forgot to include her during production.\\n\\n\r\nAmid the directionless wars and harem antics, the show gives one final attempt to instill some form of reason. The idea that a just cause is a righteous one. Fighting for others and not yourself is noble and courageous, to say the least. And this isn't just seen with Tigre; many of his opponents question their beliefs, and many of the War Maidens aid him not for themselves, but because they simply wish to help. It's entirely poetic, though, since it's never challenged nor is it looked at realistically. It's accepted as fact that Tigre's mindset is \"as straight as an arrow,\" and that nothing could be more worthy of praise. The show fails to explore any kind of ramifications attributed to such thinking, instead directing its resources to other venues.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation fair no better for Vanadis.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style at first gives the feeling of taking place within an Elder Scrolls type fantasy world, with taverns, villages, and zero modern technology. However, this is quickly replaced by the reused open terrains with overcast clouds and tent encampments. Combined with the quite jarring CG horses and platoons, it's never pretty to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs pick up some of the slack. While Tigre is rather boring with his outfit and hair, the same cannot be said for the War Maidens. While some have excessively large busts, they're all quite beautiful. Each of their designs is detailed, from their armor to their weapons. Even some of the men receive this treatment, appearing as menacing and barbaric. Everyone also has a slight sheen to their faces, with lighted eyes, making them feel a bit more alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation dips back down in quality, sadly. The choreography for the fights isn't difficult to follow so much as it is just non-existent. Arrows regularly fly from off-screen, swords are swung wildly, and the dragon abilities characters have are not impressive, no matter how much screaming is done. Being ecchi, the breasts are given special attention when the girls move, but that is usually the extent of character movements, both in and out of battle.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nHarem or not, the characters of Vanadis are completely one-dimensional, signified by either a single trait or the size of their chests.\\n\\n\r\nTigrevurmud -- known as Tigre -- is a \"prisoner\" to Elen and the leader of their joint forces. Embodying the spirit of his people, his aim in war is to make sure that it never again reaches his home of Alsace. Kind to all who approach him, he is respected by his soldiers and loved by the women around him. Never emotional, underdeveloped, and overpowered from start to finish, he is as typical and generic as they come. His only purpose in the story is to be there for the harem to be created, and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tigre's maid, Titta dotes on him 24/7. Quick to cry and unable to keep from shouting his name every other sentence, her presence serves literally nothing but Tigre. She seems to have some form of relevancy early on, spurring her master into action, but afterwards, the focus shifts from home to the wars abroad. Subsequently, Titta is lost in the process. While she is merely happy to be by Tigre's side, her place on the totem pole is low and forgotten, and no amount of niceties will change it.\\n\\n\r\nAs cold as the ice she wields, Mila is initially an antagonist towards the group. As the \"tsundere\" in the harem, she makes it difficult for anyone, not just Tigre, to get a good read on her. Short in stature and always direct, she lets her actions do the talking for her. Perhaps uncharacteristically, she has a love and sense of duty to her house, much like the man she falls for. A rival to Elen both in love and war, she constantly butts heads with her fellow War Maiden. Despite having her outer shell melted slightly by Tigre's convictions, she remains largely uninteresting the whole ride through.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable character is found in Elen. Ruler of Leitmeritz, she is confident both in her body and in battle. Playful with others yet quick to get jealous, she's rational and emotional at just the right moments. She believes the most in Tigre's cause, willing to trust both his bow and his words. Unfortunately, she is resigned to the same problem as the harem leader; never seeing any semblance of change, outlook, or personal insight, she becomes just another girl to ogle.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of these four, the rest of the cast are entirely inconsequential to anything that goes on within the anime. And that doesn't say anything about their characterization. Sure, the War Maidens see their personalities mirrored in the weapons they wield (Elen is whimsical like the wind, Elizavetta is electric, etc.), but no one amounts to anything more or are barely touched upon. Like the wars they participate in, their lives and their characters are expendable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the OP is the best part of the entire anime. It begins as a choir, followed by a calming vocalist supported by background singing. The halfway point introduces a really catchy, drum-and-vocal beat that is very easy to follow. The ending brings about an epic feeling that should have been present throughout the show, but is unexpectedly absent.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is serene, with soft piano and slow vocal arrangement. It picks up in tempo and range the further the song goes, giving off a triumphant feeling that can accompany war, depending on the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains nothing notable. With low drum pieces, eerie tones, and resounding trumpets, the tracks fit their respective scenes without providing anything of merit.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sees average to below average work all around, with no notable performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe argument with this one is the fact that it not only is a harem but is also ecchi in nature. Ecchi, though, isn't even fair to the genre. Those moments are spaced too far apart and are nearly all unoriginal. Like everything else, it tries to make these events fun and sexy, but it can't seem to come off as anything but lame.\\n\\n\r\nIts comedy is not funny, the drama is forced, and the character interactions are weak. It's a mixture of sludge that one has to wade through during the entire season, with the reward being a modicum of boobs and uneventful clashes.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is a special show. Not because of the wars it contains, not because of its lackluster characters, and not even because of its failed fan-service. It's because it will forever sit at the bottom of the pile.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, abysmal world-building, failed harem, lost message\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, repetitive art, nice character designs, low actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, everyone involved is inconsequential\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, good OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, below average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, almost zero redeeming qualities\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "I won't include a summary  because it is already provided so I'll just dive into the other categories of which I graded this anime. Please note that I have NOT read the manga nor do I have any previous knowledge of this series. Thus my judgement is entirely unbiased. Let's get to it then! ^_^\r\nART: \r\nThe art style of this anime is quite eye catching as the beautifully blended colours go well together. There was much detail where needed and it was softer where background was concerned. The portrayal  of the army from a  distant scenes gave a 3D effect, which workedwell once I got accustomed to it, considering the detail to them was well done. From the clear distinction of every character's face right down to the weapons used was well drawn. I have no complaints about art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWhile the opening goes well with the anime, I am not very fond of it. Call it a love hate relationship. It grew on me. The ending however, I loved! I felt like it captured the essence of the seriousness of the show. I don't have many complaints with the sound track because of how well each piece suited the situation and the timing which helped to build hype and I wondered what the outcomes would be. I will not find myself listening to the opening or ending for this anime, even though I am fond of the ending, simply because they are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nTigrevrumud Vorn---- our protagonist in the series is your typical anime hero. He's brave, honest and is all about the people. He is a feudal lord with a firm believe in protecting his homeland left to him by his deceased father. He is exceptionally talented with the bow and has even earned a name among higher ups in the community. Personality wise, he is very innocent and respectful. He is a clam yet tactful person who is not quick to wrath which plays to his advantage because of how well he used his resources during the war. This character is not perfect but he is not bad either. He takes risks when necessary and also knows when to walk away. \\n\\n\r\nEleonora Viltaria---- a powerful war maiden who has fallen for our protagonist.......I mean his skill with the bow (pfffft \u00ac_\u00ac )  after he attacks her in an open post battle field, is cunning and carefree yet when is totally serious when on the battle field. She takes Vorn in as a prisoner and the rest is history.  When it comes to attack plans, she definitely knows best as you will see during the series. She is brimming with confidence and always has something witty to say.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot name all the main characters as it has a pretty big cast for a 13 episode show but here are a few honorable mentions! Roland better known as Dark Hero of Brune, Marthus Rodante and  Ludmila Lourie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI was captivated from the very first episode. Everything flowed and there was no long wait for the plot to get going. The fight scenes were beautiful and the detail of the art work all around was just well done! This anime was mostly about the tactics of war and it was quite a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who like historical war themes with quick moving plots and many strong characters. The are was captivating, the sound track suited it perfectly, I cannot grantee that you would like all the character but there are definitely some you can grow to like. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Madan no Ou to Vanadis is a light novel adaptation set in a medieval fantasy world with magic, dragons and heroes. If that was the most generic story you've ever heard of, then that's probably 'cause the story IS pretty god damn generic. I watched this anime because I had a craving for medieval fantasy after seeing another, far better medieval(ish) fantasy story, Hitsugi no Chaika - ending in a rather rushed and disappointing way. I had hoped that another one like it would wash off the disappointment and it certainly worked! I'm not disappointed anymore, just plain pissed. Yay!\r\nStory (25%) - 3/10\r\nVanadis' story soundspretty impressive at first glance; a hero of the Brune Kingdom is captured by the Zhcted, Brune's rival, and forms a pact with a Zhcted war maiden to save his hometown from two powerful Brunish dukes plotting to overthrow the king. However, its execution falls completely flat on its face. The story is very linear, for the most part; hardly anything happens that isn't directly related to the protagonist and everything happens conveniently in concert with the main plot. There also isn't much world-building and it seems that the show is more comfortable telling us to go read a history book to find out how medieval times were like rather than bothering to explain how this world works. Another thing that annoyed me to no end was the fact that the heroes never seemed to have any problems in the battles they fought. In the third episode, the heroes face an army numerically superior, better armed and even had two dragons with them. And the heroes respond by using ass-pulls and inferior tactics. Yes, the tactics the heroes use are demonstrably worse than the ones their enemies used; it's like the show is proud of how over-powered they are! That's not to say their enemies were masters of warfare, but at least they used basic flanking and encirclement tactics while the heroes rushed head-on against them using cavalry, of all things. I don't know when medieval action anime will stop doing this but they need to stop thinking that good generals rushed head-on with their cavalry, those were usually used for flanking or to mow down enemies that were either routing or already fighting infantry. I may be bitching a lot about this, but only because these retarded tactics are present throughout the story. There are other incidences, like the protagonist scouting enemy territory by himself in episode 5, which no general in his right mind would ever do. The protagonist's army being able to set up traps and ambushes in episodes 8 and 10 despite the fact that they should know nothing about the terrain and an entire army routing in episode 8 just because their commander was killed (which SHOULDN'T happen to a greatly numerically superior army - the fight was 10 to 1 for crying out loud!).\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 3/10\\n\r\nThe character designs are very iffy, all the characters look 10 years younger than they should be which makes it difficult to take them seriously. It's like a generic art style modified to produce lolis where there are none. The animation isn't that great either especially when it comes to the use of CG. I burst out laughing in some of the fight scenes when the background was full of CG enemy soldiers slashing at literally nothing! How clumsy were the animators when they made this?\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 5/10\\n\r\nI actually liked the OP and ED songs - they certainly feel like they belong in this kind of show but they, along with the rest of the soundtrack, feel too extravagant and over-the-top sometimes. Not much subtlety or variation but enjoyable if you like corny D & D style tunes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 3/10\\n\r\nNow we can add generic harem cast to the show's repertoire of generic elements. The characters are really uninteresting and bland, MC included. The fanservice and harem shenanigans don't exactly help either. The villains are quite one-dimensional and by the show's end, I still have no idea why they wanted the throne or why the war maidens were fighting or why were the war maidens acting like mercenaries when they were practically royalty? There is nothing remotely interesting about any of the characters, but this is a light novel adaptation, so...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 6/10\\n\r\nMeh, it's an ok time sink, I suppose. Lots of pretty colors and brainless action and fanservice to keep you occupied. Don't expect much going into it and it won't offend you or anything.",

That excitement disappeared quite quickly after I was 3 episodes in. Aside from the first episode (which quite thoroughly covered the first chapter), everything is rushed.  Obviously when you use up 10 volumes **edit: 5 vols** worth of material and jam it into 13 episodes its not going to look pretty (12 eps in reality cause ep 1 waschapter 1). The overall effect this has on the show is that it feels like your typical, unremarkable series with specks of harem thrown in.  In all honesty, with 13 episodes, they should have slowed the pace down and just went up until after the \"Roland\" arc.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't be stretching it if I said that non-LN readers wouldn't really understand what was going on.  I wouldn't not recommend this series unless youre a fans who has read the LNs. Even then, i'd still say its worth a watch only if you really want to see \"parts\" of the series animated. Don't expect too much though, because I was clearly disappointed.",

I have personally enjoyed Madan no Ou to Vanadis from episode 1-13 which I was not really expecting at all and looking back at the overall score on MAL I must say that the anime is pretty UNDERRATED. \r\nThe \"Ecchi\" and \"Harem\" tags of the anime is pretty misleading causing a lot of people to believe that the story is comedic and just like the same conventional one involving one male protagonist who does stupid stuffs that easily cause a lot of girls to go crazy about him and that there must be also a lot of nudity. Ibelieve that a lot of people have watched this series with high fan service expectations but ended up being disappointed thus giving the anime a very low score. So, if you plan to watch this anime with a \"fan service\" mindset then this show is definitely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is certainly a harem anime but it barely focus on this particular element. It has a good plot which could have been even better if there were more material to make it beyond 13 episodes. The story occurs in some sort of medieval period which consist about several armies battling against each other for land and wealth. There are barely any comedy or awkward moments but it is more focused on strategies which are well explained that makes it easier to understand what's happening and what next and obviously action focused with some blood shot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of strong characters which will surely give you a spoil of choice to chose only one as your favourite. (Mine however is Ludmila Lourie. Cute, beautiful and with a very strong character)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty amazing with great character designs and surrounding environments in high frame rates but I've seen better than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime are not so medieval but they are REALLY AMAZING and do fit a lot of scenes that makes them really intense.\\n\\n\r\nAs said previously, I've really enjoyed this anime and I would really want it to have a second season. So, if you have the intention to watch this anime, I would refrain a lot of you not to judge it by the reviews rating this show with a low score. In fact, just don't read them and watch it and do your own conclusion.\\n",

The only part that might of lacked a little would be where he temporarily lost his memories but besides that one part everything else was extremely well written and good. \r\nAs for the anime, in my opinion the art, character design, and basically the entire animation was great but the one big problem I had with the anime was that it was too rushed. Currently there are ten light novels with Madan no Ou to Vanadis and they are by no means short on details or plot and the anime took uphalf the light novels, in other words a total of 5 into a measly 13 episodes. I'm not sure why the animation company who produced Madan no Ou to Vanadis did that but they should of just animated less of the story and plot in those 13 episodes or increased it to a half year broadcast and do around 25 episodes instead. But I guess they might of had money problems or something like that (unless they were just plain idiots but I hope not). \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said even though the rush is a problem with the anime everything else was very good. They didn't break off from the original story line like some companies do but followed it very well. The design and animation was also top notch. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend  you to add it on your anime to watch list and read the light novels!",

            "content": "With every genre there is a piece that serves as the marker for rock bottom. If people could say that your piece is worse than that, then you are the new rock bottom. I say this because when it comes to the harem genre, this show is that marker. Which sucks too because there was a lot, and I mean a lot, of potential here. So let's rip this apart piece by piece.\r\nStory: 1\r\nYes, this is literally the worst part about it. A brief summary is that a count goes to war and is captured and now must ally with his capturers to save hishomeland. The only reason that she agrees is because she likes him. Yea, digging deep for motives there. The bigger picture of the whole war he starts to save his people is so that he can reveal the villian, which is a duke in the kingdom his homeland is also apart of, as the villian he is. OK, there is some merit to it, but everyone he talks to already knows this so...... Like I said, there was a lot of potential when it comes to the plot since it set up a nice background for a really good story and chose to not only be uninteresting but a rushed mess as well as a confused one as well. There is a third of the show that stops focusing on the main objective and turns its head to a side plot that goes NO WHERE.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does depict war and and medievil combat strategy but this is bare minimum stuff. They bring in dragons just to have them killed in the same episode they do battle. THEY MADE DRAGONS LOOK LIKE PUSSIES.\\n\\n\r\nBut the plot can be forgiven if the harem part is good, right? I mean the genre is beasically set up to mean that the plot is neglectable as long as the characters are plentiful and the ecchi is plentiful, right?......... Well they managed to fuck that up too. But i will get into that later. In summary THE PLOT REALLY SUCKS and it's a damn shame since it had promise.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 6 and 5\\n\r\nThe only positive is that the opening is fucking amazing. Will probably be the saving grace to get you through each episode. The ending isn't bad either but since i was trying to just finish the show as quick as possible, I opted to skip it and just move on. Everything else on the OST is pretty forgetable. Voice acting is a range from decent to painful. The main character, Tigre (Tee-gra), sounds fine for example but the narrator whose role is to explain battles or different happenings almost hurts to listen too. Which leads to how the art of it is. While the background locations are nice to look at, they serve as 90% of the setting by staging all the battle is nothing but plains. Then there is the 3D animation. Fucking fire the team who thought those looked good. Entire armies would be 3D rendered and then shown up close. Or when the shows tries to explain a battle or character's tactics and switch to a battle ground map, it uses 3D, chess piece-like models to move around. This also the point where the narrator gets to keep talking. But trust me when I say this is the peak of the positives for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nRemind me why the harem genre exist again? Isn't it to have a large cast of women fauning over a single male lead? With each trying to get closer than the other girls? Yea? Well then somebody explain to me why the total cast of said girls totals to 2 and the second one doesn't do so till two thirds of the show? And it's not like these people are anything worth while. Take our main lead Tigre. He is a count of a rural province who is a man of the people as well as a sniper with a bow and arrow. We known that he had a father but apparently he didn't leave much of an impression since he only looks back on one statement that he made and it took another character to remind him about it. Or the first harem girl, Elen. She only likes him for his skill with a bow. Say so herself in the first episode. These people are one dimensional to the point of being laughable. The supporting cast don't favor any better as they are literally plot devices. \\n\\n\r\nOh so you will also notice something really weird too. So this story world consists of seven war maidens. They do explain that these are maidens who are chosen by dragon gear to wield said gear. Beyond this they don't explain any further. But you will notice that they show you who all seven are at one point but you never see the main character come in contact with one of them. They are said to be lost and not seen for a long while. Why introduce her then. Three of the other war maidens kind of just appear for an episode or two, two of which are for another side plot that has nothing to do with the main goal or story, the other is just there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, they fucked this up too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThis was a hard watch since my brain kept telling me that there no saving this show but I kept at it to at least make sure it was a full blown fuck up. Again it had promise and a lot of it, but this is unacceptable levels of bad. I laughed a few times but just because of things I shouldn't of found funny. This is literally the rock bottom marker for the harem genre. The harem that wasn't there and left you feeling like they were only capable of being friends anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

You just won't have time to do the story justice, and it's guaranteed to become a rushed mess!\r\nAnd that's definitely what we have here - a rushed mess. As I haven't read the light novels, I have literally no idea what goes on here, it's all just a blur of faces and places and happenings and comings and goings. There's a lot of battles, and a lot of semi-interesting strategy talk, but I have no idea what they're fighting over, or what the factions are, or why factionA is teaming up with factions B and C to fight factions D and E. And then faction F shows up and jumps into the fray because, well you tell me.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even ask. To enjoy this show, don't try to make sense of it, just go with the flow!\\n\\n\r\n(I guess the following could count as SPOILERS, if a vague description of what to expect counts as such.)\\n\\n\r\nIn every episode, thousands of nameless grunts get slaughtered in battle for no apparent reason. Normally I detest that kind of wasteful attitude towards nameless grunts. Even the most disposable of grunts deserve to at least die for some kind of cause the viewer is aware of IMO, but here they're just CGI, so even I don't care about their fate - they could kill millions of them instead of thousands, and it wouldn't make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the name- and faceless grunts die a lot though, the various named faces die a lot too, but since we aren't given enough time to get to know them before they croak it hardly matters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only people that matter here, is the dude, and the girls!\\n\\n\r\nThe dude has godly archery skills and would make Robin Hood donate his bow to the poor and retire in shame. He also has a godly talent for accidentally grabbing boobs and walking in on girls in the nude (even though their hair always covers up the essentials). And that's pretty much all there is to say about him.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all look like they were designed to give cosplayers an interesting challenge (how do you sew a dress that looks like that without having your boobs fall out?). They come in all boob sizes from D to DDD, and the DDD equipped ones take every opportunity to shame the D equipped ones for their meager endowment. They're all super feisty. And that's pretty much all there is to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nThis review reads as if I was rating it 1/10, but I actually enjoyed it, so I'll give it a six. Maybe you'll enjoy it too, if you have a soft spot for this particular kind of trash. I just wanted to be upfront with what to expect here, so less forgiving people can give it a pass.\\n",

So, i asked the users of MAL to give me recommendations. And oh boy did i miss out on this anime! \r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis Is a story about the middle ages, but then with fantasy; aka with magic, dragons etc. In this anime you follow Tigrevurmud Vorn on his quest to protect his fiefdom.\r\nSo if you like battles with swords, bows and magic, this might be your slice of bacon (I forgot what word was supposed togo there, but i like bacon, so I use bacon).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot is not very complicated, so you won't have to crack your brain while watching this.

Shiny fights and explosions are always a nice thing to see. But what really stood out for me was the way they portrayed big battles. seeing big armies clashing with eachother is great, but with great art, it is even better. And that is the case in Madan no Ou to Vanadis, receiving a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n(almost) the first thing you hear from this (or any) anime is the opening song. And i really liked the opening song. It's not your bland OP, and it gave a nice picture of what the anime was about. Also the music used in the anime was very good, receiving a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOften the main problem with anime for me is the main character. Is he likable or not? In this anime, i find the MC very likable, and you get to go through a nice growth with him. This anime isn't really a character development type anime, but that doesnt matter since i found the characters quite interesting to begin with, receiving a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have got to say: I was never bored whilst watching this anime. Even though I did it in one sitting, the show kept my attention the whole time. This anime does not have a lot of humor (though it has a bit), it does not have a lot of character development (though i do not mind since the characters were interesting to begin with) and the plot is not that spectaculair. Still, it managed to entertain me the whole time, receiving a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nadd up those points and you get a 8.4. But for my hopes of getting a second season (which is probably not going to happen) ill give it 0.1 bonus. Rounding it up and i give this anime a 9/10!",

            "content": "First things first, I want to say that I have read the light novel before I watch this show. So, most things I will review is about the adaptation itself. Despite saying that, I still will try to review the show as an anime though I can\u2019t promise it much.\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is a show about a Vorn named Tigrevumurd of a small village name Alsace that is involved in a civil war as a major commander. He asked help from a Vanadis \u2013 A warmaiden whose power is said equal to a thousand soldiers \u2013 named Eleonora Viltaria from another country.Each of Vanadis wield a supernatural weapon, a Dragonic Tools which has their own specialty. This show follows Tigrevumurd or Tigre\u2019s adventure as he defeat each of his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou doesn\u2019t has a strong premise for me.  A special boy who then involved in a fight and get help from a girl is not a rare premise in nowaday shows. But, what makes Madan no Ou special is how a war and political power plays in the story. You can\u2019t just outplay the enemies in a war by just outnumbering them, history has proved it that tactic and strategy is a deciding factor. I love how the anime shows us the overview of the battle by using a chess-like piece that is put on a map. It is easy to understand the strategy from Tigre and the flow of the battle in a big view by looking at it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the creativity by using the a chess-like piece to explain the strategy, too bad the story pace is really fast. The battle tide which is quick to change make it worse to follow the story. In additions, the fast pace of the story make it hard to know how the dialog of the character can change the war itself. As I said before, Madan no Ou is special because how politic works there. It is hard to know the political power of each character because of the fast pace dialog and the cut on the material if it\u2019s not bad enough.\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the design of Tigre. Simple is best. On the other hand, Vanadis\u2019 design is quite boring. Though it is good, it can not be said as a great design. The antagonists\u2019 design, like Thenardier or the wizard is actually beyond my expectation, they\u2019re great. The animation on battle is really good, it\u2019s clear where they put all of their budget on. Too bad even with good animation, lazy drawings ruin it all. There are several scene where the characters proportional is not balanced and few drawing where the characters posture is weird, especially on battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nOpening and ending song is really what you\u2019ll expect on an action shows. Both of them are nice, really make the mood to watch and ending the show. Then, we have well-made BGMs which make a really great watching experience.  And I have no complain how the voice of each character,  the VAs really did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the dialog of each character is too much compressed. As a consequence, I think we won\u2019t know how the nature of each character really well. The interaction feels a little forced because of it. Fortunately, it\u2019s just the nature of the side characters that didn\u2019t come out well. The main characters\u2019\u2019 nature like Tigre, several Vanadis, and Thenardier can be understood to some extent. Interaction and reaction between main characters at least reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this series as a whole. Though a fast pace story really ruins it, I love some other aspects such as how good the soundwork and great animation. I don\u2019t think the anime make this series\u2019 charms come out. Despite how I want you to read the light novel rather than watch it to know the charms of this series, I still recommend this anime to you who love action.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "This anime is a special one. Not necessarily in the sense that it does anything in an original fashion but more so in the way it manages to fail being unoriginal. This is pretty impressive in its own right. Now before anything i would just like to say that this anime was most definitely what i would call axed. Now I'm not sure if there planning on having a second season but for now i see no such thing . Therefore for now you should know that a lot of things end up being forgotten and many plot lines just kinda not finishing, maybe leftfor a second season that may never come. Anyways if you're for some reason actually okay with this then lets get on with this extremely serious review to truly analyze this piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nStory - (>- -)>/10\\n\r\nthe story is you're run of the mill generic plot line of fantasy world #807. Basically we all know how this goes. in the beginning the main character the duke of some nothing town gets captured and taken prisoner prisoner by the main heroin. Then things happen and they team up for a reason that will be revealed in the worst plot twist that ever happening ever. Then as our understanding of everything slowly becomes less and less we are introduced to a million plot lines happen that never get wrapped up and by this point nobody cares. \"Oh but wait, isn't this a harem who cares about story i want to watch my 30 yr old virgin fantasies unfold\" well as a 30 yr old virgin in the making (soon i shall ascend to that title) i can tell you that somehow this anime fails in the concept of gathering multiple personality less woman in one place to dote on our main character for no reason. However this doting rarely ever happens and it doesn't even get past blushing. Hell it doesn't even live up to the term ecchi because we get about 2 naked scenes that leave me and my penis with nothing but confusion for we are conditioned to be prepared to be aroused by ecchi scenes yet clearly this is the concept of arousing that a 10 year old child came up with when his friends told him to search up yorick on google because showing naked woman standing around doing nothing is not arousing its actually quite tedious and boring. But then this is also an action anime so maybe that can hold this anime up ... HA \\n\\n\r\nArt/ Animation - (>;_;)>/10\\n\r\nSo this takes the Utawarerumono approach of having a strategic take on things. Something to notice quickly is that a lot of the things that happen in battles are done with narration... \"Well hey at least the strategies are cool and unique\" someone cried in the distance. They found him the next day eaten by dogs. Then we have the fight scenes. Some might call them this I would call them fight power point presentations. In a real life fight scene lazy directors usually show the windup and then the reaction leaving out the part where the attack actually hits the person. This doesn't even show the reaction a lot of the time... we are just left to assume for all we know the character could be slashing a rock, a tree, or maybe the animators themselves. Otherwise there is nothing remotely interesting about the fights and not a single one is worth watching and when you have fight scenes with no fighting your left with... fight nothings... XDXDXDXDXD im going to go kill myself\\n\\n\r\nSound - (opens window)/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (prepares to jump)/10\\n\\n\r\nWait wait wait. I'm being to hard on myself. If I die my amazing speeling and grammer  and informative anime reviewing abilities go with me. So let's see characters. They existed, i guess. Umm well let's see there was the main character a generally emotionless nothing whose only goal was to have a goal then there were the females. In most harem reviews I would say their only goal was to get in the main characters pants. However none of these characters actually had this goal, hence why this failed as a harem so really what were there goals. Well ummm... to get as many soldiers killed for as little reason as possible... I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - /10\\n\r\nI'm tired. It's pretty late right now. I should probably go take a shower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - would strongly recommend/10\\n",

            "content": "I really liked the anime, the tl;dr of this is pretty much: Solid fantasy anime with good characters, good story, excellent music, good animation, and good adaptation quality. Special mentions to the protag as it's the main charm point to this series imo, being that he is an archer, and we don't see enough archer protags, especially as leaders. I did watch the anime before I read the novels, and this review is solely about the anime.\r\nIt's a very solid medieval fantasy anime revolving mostly around a war campaign led by the main character. Since it's a midieval fantasy though, don't expect elves, dwarves, orcs,etc. though dragons do make appearances of course. Very little magic for the most part, some weapons are enchanted and have special abilities though.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly interesting.\\n\r\nFor one, the protag, Tigrevurmud, is an archer, which I find really awesome. MCs almost always use some other type of weapon, since other weapon types are generally more proficient at playing a main role, archers are usually a support role. Swords are the general hero type, fists can work too for alpha type guys usually, staves/magic for the strategist type, there are some others, but that's pretty much it. So seeing a bow is really cool for a MC to me. Especially since he's forced to act like a general... using a bow, which is very exceptional. Even though most leaders can use a bow, none to my knowledge use a bow exclusively in any story.\\n\r\nThe war campaign story really works and keeps you very interested in how battles play out and where the strategy and the main players make a spot in it. We obviously know the main characters will win in the end because Narrative Causality/Plot Armor, but as usual it's the journey/how they win that matters as opposed to the end.\\n\r\nThe pacing is really fast, but I was able to follow even on my first watch what was going on. In my opinion this is probably it's biggest flaw, that the story goes too quickly, it would have made a lot more sense to have the story span 2 cours, but I think the studio did well for what they were trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are pretty decent in general, I like many of the characters. The anime does strip a fair amount of the character development out of most characters, but protag and heroine still get their fair share. A large part of the story is the development of the protag. It's done alright, as we watch him go from a person who can barely lead 100 men, to someone who leads 20,000.\\n\r\nThe other characters are not very fleshed out in the anime, but you can see their general personalities. Again, because of the story's pacing we don't get to see enough of all the characters to really understand many of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the the music, the freaking music, super fitting for the series and it is really good too, I'm going to have to get the OST if it's available because it's too good. It fits the medieval fantasy feel really well. Not much else I need to say.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the OP (I listen to it on its own), the ED is meh though. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is alright, nothing spectacular though. Nothing to complain about, and the important scenes were well animated. The art in general is pretty good, especially when drawing the skirmishes between armies.\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the anime, enough to subsequently read the light novels and then watch the anime again. Again, the development and story of the protag, and the action of the campaign he leads, is what really makes me enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, the setting and story are good, with the uniqueness of the archer general being a main sell point of the anime. Characters are okay, but the battles, and how the art and sound help accentuate these in the story, are what do the series good. I think anyone looking for a war-centric medieval story will enjoy this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI do want to mention the adaptation quality. I watched the series, read the LN up to where the anime ends, then rewatched it. The adaptation is pretty good, but condensing FIVE volumes into a 1 cour anime is kinda crazy, A LOT of scenes were left out, but nothing that was really mandatory so I think it's a really good adaptation considering what they were dealing with. The first five volumes cover the whole first arc, so it makes sense to condense it into one series.\\n\r\nNearly all the scenes that were included are accurate, no gecko ending or anything. Things are wrapped up nicely, and if you want to see what other kind of adventures the protag leads, then you can read the LN, but it doesn't leave you off at a point where something big is about to happen, a la NGNL anime.\\n\r\nI think it would have been a better anime if it was 2 cours, as a few of the characters aren't as fleshed out as in the LN, Limlisha in particular. Regardless, I think it's a solid adaptation. Props to Satelight since the goal was clearly to advertise the main series of novels by doing the complete first arc, but either couldn't or didn't want to do a full two cours, perhaps due to budget concerns. I think they managed pretty well considering that.",

            "content": "Before I start, I am reviewing this personally as the anime itself, with no comparison to it's former adaption whatsoever; Light Novel etc\r\nI actually had this on hold for a short moment before freeing up some time to watch it, not a fan of extreme fan service or ecchi in every episode, assuming it had a lot of unneeded content.\r\nThe beginning started off simple with Vorn appearing immediately then seemingly looking like the typical useless Hero playing cool and trying to aim an arrow at a War Maiden, who obviously destroys the arrow. That's how they met, she wanted him as her \"slave/prisoner\".\r\nSkip the boringparts, I actually enjoyed each episode. If you're a fan of strategy and medieval wars mixed with a little (very little) bit of fantasy with dragons, you probably may like this as it's a short and simple series.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't filled with a load of boring talk but a lot of action, with some ice breakers. The battles were crystal but somehow cut short. A 14 year old boy who is a mastermind in war strategies with special hidden powers after inheriting and picking up his family bow, accompanied by a Wind War Maiden. Easy win.\\n\\n\r\nOnly thing I disliked about the series is that she barely explained the history of the War Maidens and paid NO attention to having them appear in several openings throughout all the 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTwo maidens were given the spotlight, one episodes showed a weak and sickly maiden, three episodes showed a maiden used as a messenger, two episodes with barely 1 minute appearance of a maiden with a scythe and one episode with a bi-coloured eyed maiden fighting the wind maiden (Heroine)\\n\\n\r\n... Needless to say, just watch it as it is.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder if they will come up with a second season for this though very unlikely since the ending seemed like the Hero, Vorn would someday become King, and obviously would gain the favour of the people, his knights and the maidens.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever happened to the Duke who left on a ship and was familiar with the maiden Valentina?\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the Prime Minister who seemed uncomfortable with Vorn being given the title Knight of the Moonlight to which anyone given the title has the authority to become the next Ruler of the country.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like a fair enough closure, leaving viewers assuming that he will be the next King, maybe marrying the Princess with the War Maidens by his side.",

There really isn't much to say because the show was pretty much bad porn without sex, masquerading as a medieval drama sprinkled with politics and battle tactics so lazily thrown in they would have been better off left out and handing via exposition. You know what? I take that back, because that was how the battle tactics were handled. Exposition via diagram, and talking head scenes DURING the battles. Trash.\r\nLike, it's just fucking boobs. If the story and action wasn't shit, I could forgive it, andI often do, but this show is ONLY boobs. That is the only good quality of the show that comes to mind. The only time the big boobs aren't moving are during talking head scenes that explain pretty much nothing to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, they all look like reused designs.

Just feels unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nThe specific part that hit the nail in the coffin on this one for me was when Obligatory-Blonde-Assistant was bit in the boob by a falling snake from the sky, and it was so obviously so that Not-Kirito-I-Promise-He-Gots-Red-Hair-and-a-Bow could suck on her boob to suck out the poison, which isn't even a valid treatment for that kind of wound and would be useless in the best of cases and aide the venom's spread in the worst.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, save yourself the trouble and go watch a porno. Afterwards you can watch Arslan Senki and see what this show was not really trying to be.",

            "content": "I heard about this anime relatively early on and decided to watch it after the season was finished and done with, so I could watch it all in one go. I only made it through 11 of the 13 episodes because it was easily one of the worst modern anime's I've seen in my growing list. I only watched so far ahead and almost completed the series because I had a vague hope that it would somehow do a 180 degree turn and become something good. But it just progressively kept getting worse to the point of me questioning if I was a masochist forwillfully watching this.\\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10: I would give it a ZERO OUT OF TEN. But it isn't an option. At first glance, as others have said, the story appears to be a run-of-the-mill medieval-fantasy anime, except Ecchi and Harem tagged along with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is completely watchable, but towards the end of the first episode onwards is dramatically poor and cliche-ridden garbage full of overly-convenient coincidences and a blatant bias towards the MC and his merry Harem of jailbait and breast-physics being nigh unstoppable under any circumstances. Even their soldiers are basically unstoppable. \\n\\n\r\nThe only time you EVER see the \"good guys\" soldiers being killed is when the only sane/realistic medieval character decides to cleave people down the middle with an indestructible sword as big as him. And also when the barbaric Arabic pirate army starts to become competent for literally 20 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also stops mid-sentence just to bring you a chess-style recreation of the tactics used by the warring sides during fights, which is interesting... but only serves to emphasize how unrealistically overpowered the MC and everyone under his command are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is the only real redeeming quality of the series. It is extremely fluent and very crisp. They aren't afraid to show violence and blood which adds to the fight sequences, albeit it's 99.9% the enemy being cleaved.  There is also an over-abundance of walking breasts. Even the \"underdeveloped\" character that is introduced and mocked for not having large breasts, actually does have very noticeable large breasts by real world standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The sound was generally well done. Once the \"dragons\" came into play though, everytime you heard a dragon roar it sounded like it was recorded back in 1960 from an amusement park ride. This is severely unnerving when the good sound quality suddenly implodes into something that would make people in the 70's cringe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10: As soon as the series starts, it becomes plainly obvious we are in for a downright terrible MC who is prone to speeches about how he is the ultimate good guy but somehow humble. He is so brazenly painted as the ultimate good guy that it hurts to have him in literally any political discussion, or any discussion at all because it WILL devolve into the latter \"I'm the good guy\" speeches.\\n\\n\r\nHe also suddenly gains the ability shoot deathrays from an Onyx Bow using regular arrows, which are barely short of tactical nukes to the target they are hitting. He is also apparently able to hit targets shooting perfectly straight at them at absurdly long distance despite GRAVITY.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the supporting characters who are in themselves anomalies. The main female protagonist, being labeled a \"War Maiden\", is apparently one of roughly 7 people who inherit Walking-Apocalypse grade weapons that can roughly destroy entire armies without effort. But they don't use them for that, they use them at only rare chances of seeing an opponent that ISN'T human, in a land that is monopolized by humans warring with eachother. If that wasn't enough, the amount of plot-armor handed out is utterly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: I can honestly say I enjoyed this more than I expected after the episode where the MC is suddenly revealed to be hyper-competent and dramatically overpowered in every single possible way except raw physical strength. The enjoyable part being when it pulled the extremely rare and elusive plot-twist when a \"bad guy\" decides to leave while he's ahead to save everyone's time and effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: Single handedly one of the worst anime's I've ever seen. The character development is literally non-existent. The MC is a humble, hyper-competent, blatantly overpowered, uber-good-guy that reeks of overly cliche tropes. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting female characters are either walking breasts, moody because they are not walking breasts, or are jealousy ridden because walking breasts are their romantic rival.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys armies die to a stiff wind, while the good guys are seemingly all walking juggernauts. Especially when they can apparently obliterate entire armies well over 3 times their size while taking minimal casualties in straight-up fighting. This is also dramatically overplayed as well. The good guys are always outnumbered in every scenario, but win anyways because of obscure and overly specific tactics that are too tediously played out to be usable in actual fights.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Avoid this anime at pretty much all costs. Unless you enjoy watching confident and proven military leaders, who outnumber the enemy almost constantly at least 3-1... lose to a hyper-confident, backwater teenager simply because \"He is the Good Guy\" and has unbreakable plot-armor.",

When I did a little searching around for the series I was a little sad to find that the anime's 13 episodes were adapted from 5 novels, to me that seems a little too rushed because when I was watching the anime some parts I didn't understand likely due to things that have been left out from the novels. Regardless I still enjoyed the anime even though it seemed rushed and I didn'tunderstand some parts of it. I'm hoping this will get a season 2 or a bunch of OVAs at least.",

I don't care how bad of a person Zion was, it sucks when they write characters that are op and never lose. It's to the point where I don't like the main characters. With what i have watched the best shows are where the main characters lose fights. They struggle with personal loss that ends up making the viewer wonder \"How can they possible come back from this?\" This show doesn't have that with what i have seen so far. True the main character is nowa slave but he is only one in title. He can still wander around free within the kingdom which is doesn't convey the feeling of loss as well as it should. Overall i think that the main characters and the \"War Maidens\" are to op which makes the shows story and character development suffer.",

            "content": "War.  It's a grueling way to help your country.  The lives of several thousand men sacrificed to help benefit one country's benefits.  You hear about all the sorts of things wars have, but have you really understood the inner workings and tactical strategies?  Well, that's where Madan no Ou to Vandis comes in.  Let's take aim!\r\nStory (6.00/10): The story of Vanadis follows from the perspective or Tigrevurund Vorn, or Tigre.  On a battlefield one day, amidst the corpses of his fallen comrades, he takes aim at a woman riding on a horse, a war maiden, who has just demolishedhis whole army.  After taking aim, he tries to shoot her down, only to become captive to Elenora, as she is called.  Sending the two of them into a spiraling journey as tensions rise between their two countries.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story basically sums up to following these two characters as they try and fight through a war, with each battle being a new battle and event in the ever going war, with each battle being a battle with usually a different opponent and progressing through their goals to fight and come victorious.  The show gets props for deconstructing the idea of war by making every little event become crucial to the character's goals and ideals.  There are however, some big flaws with this series, mostly with its execution and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe execution for the series wavers heavily, with some parts being rather well written, while other parts are written rather poorly.  This problem is heavily shown in the transitions from one scene to another.  Vanadis...has probably one of the worst scene transitions in anime period.  The show constantly changes from scene to scene, and sometimes even changes the scene completely, leaving the audience dazed and confused as to what exactly is going on.  In addition, the world of Vanadis is a very interesting place, talking about its lore and legends in some of its episodes such as the dragon gear and the goddesses in the realm.  However, the show doesn't give you an opportunity to fully enjoy the show at all because they don't give enough explanation to the show's basic lore, which really takes away from an otherwise fantastic show.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show's pacing is just awful.  You don't get enough time to truly enjoy anything in the show, and you really don't have the chance to let the current scenario sink in.  Mostly, the show just pokes in at a specific scene, than goes off to somewhere else without word or warning.  The pacing really does take a lot of the show's credibility away because it rushes through its own story so much that you can't enjoy it very much  (This really only applies beyond the first three episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Vanadis had a lot of potential.  It showed us the prospects of war and the sheer amount of strategy and thinking that goes into it, but that's all it really does.  You don't really get any semblance as to what the world of Vanadis, which really is a shame due to how well that could've worked conjunction into the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great story concept  (the deconstruction of war that is)\\n\r\n-  Untold world\\n\r\n-  Awful pacing\\n\r\n-  Very poor execution\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6.00/10): In addition, the characters of Vanadis share a same downfall similar to the story.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Tigrevurund Vorn, the main protagonist of this series, as well as an archer that would put Katniss Everdeen to shame.  As the count of Alsace, the and of his birth, Tigre is caught by the war maiden Elen, and becomes her captive in her principality.  From then on, Tigre asks his capturerer to help protect his homeland, and eventually gets the opportunity to do so.  As the series goes on, you can see his development beyond his simple goal of protecting his homeland as he meets new characters that aid him along his journey.  Beyond that, though, you really don't know very much about him.  He has this weapon and lineage that you basically know nothing about, and only a small bit of his personality really comes out.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Elenora, the war maiden of the series.  In Vanadis, we have individuals called war maidens, women who have been chosen by a dragon gear, a weapon with special abilities and power, all of which have control over their own principalities and people.  Elen is an interesting character.  A bit of a jokester, (and maybe a little bit perverted), Elen helps Tigre on his quest to help his people in exchange for power over his land.  In the story, you get some details as to what kind of women she was before, and the connections she has between some characters, but you don't really get to learn about her very much.  She's an interesting character that has no details put in, which really makes the show a bit disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for supporting characters, we have constant characters that you see, such as Lim, Titta, Ludmila, and a few others, and then you have those characters that you don't really see at all, or get introduced at one point, before going away.  The supporting cast, are basically a mystery since you don't actually get to see or know a lot of them since most of them REALLY only serve as plot devices in order to move the story along.  This even includes the main villain of the story, Duke Thernardier, who supposedly is the one corrupting the country for his own purpose, but is a character you don't really see or know about since he shows his face only in the last two episodes, and even then, it's freaking disappointing.  This also brings me to another point, which are the seven war maidens.\\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Vanadis, there are seven war maidens that exist in the lands, all of them holding a specific dragon gear.  From the title art, and the opening, you'd expect to see them all at some point, right?  Wrong.  The series establishes that there are seven war maidens, but you really only get to know two out of seven of the war maidens.  Most of them you don't even get to meet or know the names of, which just shows how much potential this show had, but failed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting main cast\\n\r\n-  Little to no detail for the characters you see or learn about\\n\r\n-  Plot devices as the supporting cast\\n\r\n-  War maidens not utilized though established\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.11/10 and 8.88/10):  The art for the series is what I regard as high quality.  The artwork for the series is stunning and beautiful, accurately demonstrating a medieval war zone of sorts with its massive armor clad armies and detailed country banners held high.  In addition, the character designs displayed are for the most part, very well done.  The armors from the different bad guys, as well as the sword designs, and for the war maidens are very well done, with detail definitely not lacking from one scene to the other.  However, the animation is, like everything else in this series, a double-edged sword.  \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the stunning animation, there also exists the 3-D, which...ah...sucks.  The series at times goes into a sort of planning board in order to accurately describe the thought processes of either side's strategists, using little dioramas of little figures to represent and describe what is going on.  This is a plus for the series for those who don't fully understand what is going on and adds to the concept of war that this show excels at telling.  However, the little figures used look very, very bad on account of the awful 3-D animation that constantly plagues this series, since they use the diorama constantly.  Plus, they also make whole armies in 3-D sometimes, and it just does not look good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is an ecchi show, time to talk about the ecchi.  To be honest, I was very surprised.  The ecchi in this show is all but non-existent, mostly existing solely in the designs of its war maidens  (since pretty much all of the war maidens have breasts that make you wonder how they can function in battle, and the only one with the normal-sized chest is considered flat.  -.-)  Apart from their questionable battlewear, there really isn't much ecchi in this show.  Sure you have like three bath scenes in this show, and a couple accidental boob grabs, but that's basically it.  Hell, you'd find more ecchi in a romantic comedy show that's not tagged ecchi that in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, well, a little word.  As long as there is at least one VERY memorable track in the soundtrack, the show gets decent high marks for the sound category.  Vanadis succeeds this by giving us its opening.  (Just listen to it.)  The heroic and grand sound of Vanadis's opening literally gave me shivers when I first heard it, and has become one of my favorite tracks since.  The loud fanfare, the triumphant tone of going to war and returning a hero; it fits the show so well that I could cry.  \\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the rest of the show's soundtrack I would consider to be good, but not as memorable as the opening song.  They all have a very similar flair of mixing medieval sounds and heroic voices, but nothing I could hear held a candle to the opening.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good normal animation\\n\r\n+  DAT OPENING\\n\r\n-   Awful 3-D animation\\n\r\n-   Rest of the soundtrack was meh\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (7.00/10):  So, at the end of the day, what are my feelings about this show?  I've stated before that this show is its own enemy, it's own double-edged sword.  The show is interesting and grand, but doesn't really deliver with its execution.  The characters are interesting, but there wasn't enough detail to them that really made them more real and three-dimensional.  The art was good in one sense, and awful in another.  And the music had a fantastic opening, and the rest of the tracks sorta lagged behind.  I guess I could say that Vanadis was an interesting show for me to watch, in which I looked forward to every episode week after week.\\n\\n\r\nDId I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes, absolutely.  Regardless of its flaws, Vanadis enthralled me with its use of military tactics and really brought the idea of the battlefield in animated form.  It succeeded very well in that regard and portrayed an entire war in the span of its runtime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nThe show had its fair share of problems in basically every category.  As for personal dislikes, I felt as though many scenes shown in the show were handled so poorly that they shouldn't have even bothered to put it in.  Some characters seemed virtually pointless, and the show attempted to make a character death seem more important than it actually was.  I didn't really feel anything on account of the hoards of other characters that shared as much plot importance as the one that died, not to mention I honestly didn't really know his name cause he didn't really show up very often.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nFor strategists and fans of war and boobs, go ahead, go wild.  The show does have its perks, with its stunning character designs and war strategies sprinkled in every single episode to make the core part of the show thriving and well.  While it does this, it neglects its other parts such as building the world and its characters.  So, if you don't mind somewhat one-dimensional characters or a world that you really won't get to know, then this will be a good watch for you.  \\n\\n\r\nAuthor's note:  I still don't fully understand how Elen can function on the battlefield.  Those things must weigh a ton.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.20/10",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWar, when diminished to its base components, is sadly tragic. It's hard to justify the killings of thousands of people for any kind of cause. But some are better than others: bringing about peace, saving a subjugated group, or protecting one's home. For as long as humans have lived, war has not only shaped the past, has not only persisted in the present, but will most likely never dwindle in the future. An almost inevitability, war brings out the best and the worst in people. For Madan no Ou to Vanadis, it certainly brings out the worst insomething.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nVanadis begins with the bowman Tigre meeting Elen, a War Maiden, on the battlefield. After being taken hostage, the two decide to help one another in protecting Tigre's hometown of Alsace.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the show is about war: the battles, the aftereffects, the planning, and the formations. And to this end, it fails miserably. A lot of this has to do with the world-building it attempts to employ. Country names, nearby towns, and faraway lands are talked about as if the audience is supposed to simply know that such areas exist. It disconnects the viewer from what is going on, because he or she just cannot follow who's from where, which side is fighting what, and why they're all fighting in the first place. Simultaneously, multiple sub-plots exist at any given moment, such as Elen's trek to visit Sasha or the King's madness. The aforementioned difficulty in understanding what is going on persists here as well. Since it wasn't explained properly before, it remains discombobulated after.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actual field skirmishes, the anime adopts a narration approach. Going into explanatory mode, the show does its best to clarify the formations of the warring sides and their plan of attack. The point here is to make it feel as if it's a war that the characters are participating in. Again, though, it falls flat: the majority of the action focuses not on the entire battle, but on the singular duels taking place. Elen fighting against a dragon or Tigre squaring off against the opposing general are fine as standalone fights. In context, though, it doesn't seem to fit since their part is just one small piece to the much bigger puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime isn't having such a tough job conveying the severity of the wars going on, it steps back into its secondary role as a harem. Once again, though, the anime cannot deliver. A lot of the problems here stem from the show refusing to address or at least elaborate on the relationships that exist between Tigre and the rest of the girls. It's alluded to heavily for each of them, with constant teasing and wordplay, but it never comes off as if the characters are anything but friends to our main character. What's even more strange is the apparent lack of the harem. Particular characters are sometimes shown only once or twice, despite given relative importance. Worse still, there exists a person shown in the opening and closing sequences, but never appears over the course of the show. It's almost as if the anime forgot to include her during production.\\n\\n\r\nAmid the directionless wars and harem antics, the show gives one final attempt to instill some form of reason. The idea that a just cause is a righteous one. Fighting for others and not yourself is noble and courageous, to say the least. And this isn't just seen with Tigre; many of his opponents question their beliefs, and many of the War Maidens aid him not for themselves, but because they simply wish to help. It's entirely poetic, though, since it's never challenged nor is it looked at realistically. It's accepted as fact that Tigre's mindset is \"as straight as an arrow,\" and that nothing could be more worthy of praise. The show fails to explore any kind of ramifications attributed to such thinking, instead directing its resources to other venues.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation fair no better for Vanadis.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style at first gives the feeling of taking place within an Elder Scrolls type fantasy world, with taverns, villages, and zero modern technology. However, this is quickly replaced by the reused open terrains with overcast clouds and tent encampments. Combined with the quite jarring CG horses and platoons, it's never pretty to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs pick up some of the slack. While Tigre is rather boring with his outfit and hair, the same cannot be said for the War Maidens. While some have excessively large busts, they're all quite beautiful. Each of their designs is detailed, from their armor to their weapons. Even some of the men receive this treatment, appearing as menacing and barbaric. Everyone also has a slight sheen to their faces, with lighted eyes, making them feel a bit more alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation dips back down in quality, sadly. The choreography for the fights isn't difficult to follow so much as it is just non-existent. Arrows regularly fly from off-screen, swords are swung wildly, and the dragon abilities characters have are not impressive, no matter how much screaming is done. Being ecchi, the breasts are given special attention when the girls move, but that is usually the extent of character movements, both in and out of battle.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nHarem or not, the characters of Vanadis are completely one-dimensional, signified by either a single trait or the size of their chests.\\n\\n\r\nTigrevurmud -- known as Tigre -- is a \"prisoner\" to Elen and the leader of their joint forces. Embodying the spirit of his people, his aim in war is to make sure that it never again reaches his home of Alsace. Kind to all who approach him, he is respected by his soldiers and loved by the women around him. Never emotional, underdeveloped, and overpowered from start to finish, he is as typical and generic as they come. His only purpose in the story is to be there for the harem to be created, and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tigre's maid, Titta dotes on him 24/7. Quick to cry and unable to keep from shouting his name every other sentence, her presence serves literally nothing but Tigre. She seems to have some form of relevancy early on, spurring her master into action, but afterwards, the focus shifts from home to the wars abroad. Subsequently, Titta is lost in the process. While she is merely happy to be by Tigre's side, her place on the totem pole is low and forgotten, and no amount of niceties will change it.\\n\\n\r\nAs cold as the ice she wields, Mila is initially an antagonist towards the group. As the \"tsundere\" in the harem, she makes it difficult for anyone, not just Tigre, to get a good read on her. Short in stature and always direct, she lets her actions do the talking for her. Perhaps uncharacteristically, she has a love and sense of duty to her house, much like the man she falls for. A rival to Elen both in love and war, she constantly butts heads with her fellow War Maiden. Despite having her outer shell melted slightly by Tigre's convictions, she remains largely uninteresting the whole ride through.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable character is found in Elen. Ruler of Leitmeritz, she is confident both in her body and in battle. Playful with others yet quick to get jealous, she's rational and emotional at just the right moments. She believes the most in Tigre's cause, willing to trust both his bow and his words. Unfortunately, she is resigned to the same problem as the harem leader; never seeing any semblance of change, outlook, or personal insight, she becomes just another girl to ogle.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of these four, the rest of the cast are entirely inconsequential to anything that goes on within the anime. And that doesn't say anything about their characterization. Sure, the War Maidens see their personalities mirrored in the weapons they wield (Elen is whimsical like the wind, Elizavetta is electric, etc.), but no one amounts to anything more or are barely touched upon. Like the wars they participate in, their lives and their characters are expendable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably, the OP is the best part of the entire anime. It begins as a choir, followed by a calming vocalist supported by background singing. The halfway point introduces a really catchy, drum-and-vocal beat that is very easy to follow. The ending brings about an epic feeling that should have been present throughout the show, but is unexpectedly absent.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is serene, with soft piano and slow vocal arrangement. It picks up in tempo and range the further the song goes, giving off a triumphant feeling that can accompany war, depending on the outcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack contains nothing notable. With low drum pieces, eerie tones, and resounding trumpets, the tracks fit their respective scenes without providing anything of merit.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sees average to below average work all around, with no notable performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe argument with this one is the fact that it not only is a harem but is also ecchi in nature. Ecchi, though, isn't even fair to the genre. Those moments are spaced too far apart and are nearly all unoriginal. Like everything else, it tries to make these events fun and sexy, but it can't seem to come off as anything but lame.\\n\\n\r\nIts comedy is not funny, the drama is forced, and the character interactions are weak. It's a mixture of sludge that one has to wade through during the entire season, with the reward being a modicum of boobs and uneventful clashes.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is a special show. Not because of the wars it contains, not because of its lackluster characters, and not even because of its failed fan-service. It's because it will forever sit at the bottom of the pile.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, abysmal world-building, failed harem, lost message\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, repetitive art, nice character designs, low actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, everyone involved is inconsequential\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, good OP, okay ED, bad soundtrack, below average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, almost zero redeeming qualities\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 1/10",

            "content": "I won't include a summary  because it is already provided so I'll just dive into the other categories of which I graded this anime. Please note that I have NOT read the manga nor do I have any previous knowledge of this series. Thus my judgement is entirely unbiased. Let's get to it then! ^_^\r\nART: \r\nThe art style of this anime is quite eye catching as the beautifully blended colours go well together. There was much detail where needed and it was softer where background was concerned. The portrayal  of the army from a  distant scenes gave a 3D effect, which workedwell once I got accustomed to it, considering the detail to them was well done. From the clear distinction of every character's face right down to the weapons used was well drawn. I have no complaints about art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nWhile the opening goes well with the anime, I am not very fond of it. Call it a love hate relationship. It grew on me. The ending however, I loved! I felt like it captured the essence of the seriousness of the show. I don't have many complaints with the sound track because of how well each piece suited the situation and the timing which helped to build hype and I wondered what the outcomes would be. I will not find myself listening to the opening or ending for this anime, even though I am fond of the ending, simply because they are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nTigrevrumud Vorn---- our protagonist in the series is your typical anime hero. He's brave, honest and is all about the people. He is a feudal lord with a firm believe in protecting his homeland left to him by his deceased father. He is exceptionally talented with the bow and has even earned a name among higher ups in the community. Personality wise, he is very innocent and respectful. He is a clam yet tactful person who is not quick to wrath which plays to his advantage because of how well he used his resources during the war. This character is not perfect but he is not bad either. He takes risks when necessary and also knows when to walk away. \\n\\n\r\nEleonora Viltaria---- a powerful war maiden who has fallen for our protagonist.......I mean his skill with the bow (pfffft \u00ac_\u00ac )  after he attacks her in an open post battle field, is cunning and carefree yet when is totally serious when on the battle field. She takes Vorn in as a prisoner and the rest is history.  When it comes to attack plans, she definitely knows best as you will see during the series. She is brimming with confidence and always has something witty to say.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot name all the main characters as it has a pretty big cast for a 13 episode show but here are a few honorable mentions! Roland better known as Dark Hero of Brune, Marthus Rodante and  Ludmila Lourie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI was captivated from the very first episode. Everything flowed and there was no long wait for the plot to get going. The fight scenes were beautiful and the detail of the art work all around was just well done! This anime was mostly about the tactics of war and it was quite a watch. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who like historical war themes with quick moving plots and many strong characters. The are was captivating, the sound track suited it perfectly, I cannot grantee that you would like all the character but there are definitely some you can grow to like. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Madan no Ou to Vanadis is a light novel adaptation set in a medieval fantasy world with magic, dragons and heroes. If that was the most generic story you've ever heard of, then that's probably 'cause the story IS pretty god damn generic. I watched this anime because I had a craving for medieval fantasy after seeing another, far better medieval(ish) fantasy story, Hitsugi no Chaika - ending in a rather rushed and disappointing way. I had hoped that another one like it would wash off the disappointment and it certainly worked! I'm not disappointed anymore, just plain pissed. Yay!\r\nStory (25%) - 3/10\r\nVanadis' story soundspretty impressive at first glance; a hero of the Brune Kingdom is captured by the Zhcted, Brune's rival, and forms a pact with a Zhcted war maiden to save his hometown from two powerful Brunish dukes plotting to overthrow the king. However, its execution falls completely flat on its face. The story is very linear, for the most part; hardly anything happens that isn't directly related to the protagonist and everything happens conveniently in concert with the main plot. There also isn't much world-building and it seems that the show is more comfortable telling us to go read a history book to find out how medieval times were like rather than bothering to explain how this world works. Another thing that annoyed me to no end was the fact that the heroes never seemed to have any problems in the battles they fought. In the third episode, the heroes face an army numerically superior, better armed and even had two dragons with them. And the heroes respond by using ass-pulls and inferior tactics. Yes, the tactics the heroes use are demonstrably worse than the ones their enemies used; it's like the show is proud of how over-powered they are! That's not to say their enemies were masters of warfare, but at least they used basic flanking and encirclement tactics while the heroes rushed head-on against them using cavalry, of all things. I don't know when medieval action anime will stop doing this but they need to stop thinking that good generals rushed head-on with their cavalry, those were usually used for flanking or to mow down enemies that were either routing or already fighting infantry. I may be bitching a lot about this, but only because these retarded tactics are present throughout the story. There are other incidences, like the protagonist scouting enemy territory by himself in episode 5, which no general in his right mind would ever do. The protagonist's army being able to set up traps and ambushes in episodes 8 and 10 despite the fact that they should know nothing about the terrain and an entire army routing in episode 8 just because their commander was killed (which SHOULDN'T happen to a greatly numerically superior army - the fight was 10 to 1 for crying out loud!).\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 3/10\\n\r\nThe character designs are very iffy, all the characters look 10 years younger than they should be which makes it difficult to take them seriously. It's like a generic art style modified to produce lolis where there are none. The animation isn't that great either especially when it comes to the use of CG. I burst out laughing in some of the fight scenes when the background was full of CG enemy soldiers slashing at literally nothing! How clumsy were the animators when they made this?\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 5/10\\n\r\nI actually liked the OP and ED songs - they certainly feel like they belong in this kind of show but they, along with the rest of the soundtrack, feel too extravagant and over-the-top sometimes. Not much subtlety or variation but enjoyable if you like corny D & D style tunes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 3/10\\n\r\nNow we can add generic harem cast to the show's repertoire of generic elements. The characters are really uninteresting and bland, MC included. The fanservice and harem shenanigans don't exactly help either. The villains are quite one-dimensional and by the show's end, I still have no idea why they wanted the throne or why the war maidens were fighting or why were the war maidens acting like mercenaries when they were practically royalty? There is nothing remotely interesting about any of the characters, but this is a light novel adaptation, so...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 6/10\\n\r\nMeh, it's an ok time sink, I suppose. Lots of pretty colors and brainless action and fanservice to keep you occupied. Don't expect much going into it and it won't offend you or anything.",

That excitement disappeared quite quickly after I was 3 episodes in. Aside from the first episode (which quite thoroughly covered the first chapter), everything is rushed.  Obviously when you use up 10 volumes **edit: 5 vols** worth of material and jam it into 13 episodes its not going to look pretty (12 eps in reality cause ep 1 waschapter 1). The overall effect this has on the show is that it feels like your typical, unremarkable series with specks of harem thrown in.  In all honesty, with 13 episodes, they should have slowed the pace down and just went up until after the \"Roland\" arc.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't be stretching it if I said that non-LN readers wouldn't really understand what was going on.  I wouldn't not recommend this series unless youre a fans who has read the LNs. Even then, i'd still say its worth a watch only if you really want to see \"parts\" of the series animated. Don't expect too much though, because I was clearly disappointed.",

            "content": "This is a SPOILER FREE review!\r\nWell... I have personally enjoyed Madan no Ou to Vanadis from episode 1-13 which I was not really expecting at all and looking back at the overall score on MAL I must say that the anime is pretty UNDERRATED. \r\nThe \"Ecchi\" and \"Harem\" tags of the anime is pretty misleading causing a lot of people to believe that the story is comedic and just like the same conventional one involving one male protagonist who does stupid stuffs that easily cause a lot of girls to go crazy about him and that there must be also a lot of nudity. Ibelieve that a lot of people have watched this series with high fan service expectations but ended up being disappointed thus giving the anime a very low score. So, if you plan to watch this anime with a \"fan service\" mindset then this show is definitely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is certainly a harem anime but it barely focus on this particular element. It has a good plot which could have been even better if there were more material to make it beyond 13 episodes. The story occurs in some sort of medieval period which consist about several armies battling against each other for land and wealth. There are barely any comedy or awkward moments but it is more focused on strategies which are well explained that makes it easier to understand what's happening and what next and obviously action focused with some blood shot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has a lot of strong characters which will surely give you a spoil of choice to chose only one as your favourite. (Mine however is Ludmila Lourie. Cute, beautiful and with a very strong character)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty amazing with great character designs and surrounding environments in high frame rates but I've seen better than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime are not so medieval but they are REALLY AMAZING and do fit a lot of scenes that makes them really intense.\\n\\n\r\nAs said previously, I've really enjoyed this anime and I would really want it to have a second season. So, if you have the intention to watch this anime, I would refrain a lot of you not to judge it by the reviews rating this show with a low score. In fact, just don't read them and watch it and do your own conclusion.\\n",

The only part that might of lacked a little would be where he temporarily lost his memories but besides that one part everything else was extremely well written and good. \r\nAs for the anime, in my opinion the art, character design, and basically the entire animation was great but the one big problem I had with the anime was that it was too rushed. Currently there are ten light novels with Madan no Ou to Vanadis and they are by no means short on details or plot and the anime took uphalf the light novels, in other words a total of 5 into a measly 13 episodes. I'm not sure why the animation company who produced Madan no Ou to Vanadis did that but they should of just animated less of the story and plot in those 13 episodes or increased it to a half year broadcast and do around 25 episodes instead. But I guess they might of had money problems or something like that (unless they were just plain idiots but I hope not). \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said even though the rush is a problem with the anime everything else was very good. They didn't break off from the original story line like some companies do but followed it very well. The design and animation was also top notch. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend  you to add it on your anime to watch list and read the light novels!",

So let's rip this apart piece by piece.\r\nStory: 1\r\nYes, this is literally the worst part about it. A brief summary is that a count goes to war and is captured and now must ally with his capturers to save hishomeland. The only reason that she agrees is because she likes him. Yea, digging deep for motives there. The bigger picture of the whole war he starts to save his people is so that he can reveal the villian, which is a duke in the kingdom his homeland is also apart of, as the villian he is. OK, there is some merit to it, but everyone he talks to already knows this so...... Like I said, there was a lot of potential when it comes to the plot since it set up a nice background for a really good story and chose to not only be uninteresting but a rushed mess as well as a confused one as well. There is a third of the show that stops focusing on the main objective and turns its head to a side plot that goes NO WHERE.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does depict war and and medievil combat strategy but this is bare minimum stuff. They bring in dragons just to have them killed in the same episode they do battle. THEY MADE DRAGONS LOOK LIKE PUSSIES.\\n\\n\r\nBut the plot can be forgiven if the harem part is good, right? I mean the genre is beasically set up to mean that the plot is neglectable as long as the characters are plentiful and the ecchi is plentiful, right?......... Well they managed to fuck that up too. But i will get into that later. In summary THE PLOT REALLY SUCKS and it's a damn shame since it had promise.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 6 and 5\\n\r\nThe only positive is that the opening is fucking amazing. Will probably be the saving grace to get you through each episode. The ending isn't bad either but since i was trying to just finish the show as quick as possible, I opted to skip it and just move on. Everything else on the OST is pretty forgetable. Voice acting is a range from decent to painful. The main character, Tigre (Tee-gra), sounds fine for example but the narrator whose role is to explain battles or different happenings almost hurts to listen too. Which leads to how the art of it is. While the background locations are nice to look at, they serve as 90% of the setting by staging all the battle is nothing but plains. Then there is the 3D animation. Fucking fire the team who thought those looked good. Entire armies would be 3D rendered and then shown up close. Or when the shows tries to explain a battle or character's tactics and switch to a battle ground map, it uses 3D, chess piece-like models to move around. This also the point where the narrator gets to keep talking. But trust me when I say this is the peak of the positives for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\r\nRemind me why the harem genre exist again? Isn't it to have a large cast of women fauning over a single male lead? With each trying to get closer than the other girls? Yea? Well then somebody explain to me why the total cast of said girls totals to 2 and the second one doesn't do so till two thirds of the show? And it's not like these people are anything worth while. Take our main lead Tigre. He is a count of a rural province who is a man of the people as well as a sniper with a bow and arrow. We known that he had a father but apparently he didn't leave much of an impression since he only looks back on one statement that he made and it took another character to remind him about it. Or the first harem girl, Elen. She only likes him for his skill with a bow. Say so herself in the first episode. These people are one dimensional to the point of being laughable. The supporting cast don't favor any better as they are literally plot devices. \\n\\n\r\nOh so you will also notice something really weird too. So this story world consists of seven war maidens. They do explain that these are maidens who are chosen by dragon gear to wield said gear. Beyond this they don't explain any further. But you will notice that they show you who all seven are at one point but you never see the main character come in contact with one of them. They are said to be lost and not seen for a long while. Why introduce her then. Three of the other war maidens kind of just appear for an episode or two, two of which are for another side plot that has nothing to do with the main goal or story, the other is just there.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, they fucked this up too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThis was a hard watch since my brain kept telling me that there no saving this show but I kept at it to at least make sure it was a full blown fuck up. Again it had promise and a lot of it, but this is unacceptable levels of bad. I laughed a few times but just because of things I shouldn't of found funny. This is literally the rock bottom marker for the harem genre. The harem that wasn't there and left you feeling like they were only capable of being friends anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

            "content": "Cramming five light novels worth of plot into a single cour anime is A BAD IDEA, mmkay? You just won't have time to do the story justice, and it's guaranteed to become a rushed mess!\r\nAnd that's definitely what we have here - a rushed mess. As I haven't read the light novels, I have literally no idea what goes on here, it's all just a blur of faces and places and happenings and comings and goings. There's a lot of battles, and a lot of semi-interesting strategy talk, but I have no idea what they're fighting over, or what the factions are, or why factionA is teaming up with factions B and C to fight factions D and E. And then faction F shows up and jumps into the fray because, well you tell me.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even ask. To enjoy this show, don't try to make sense of it, just go with the flow!\\n\\n\r\n(I guess the following could count as SPOILERS, if a vague description of what to expect counts as such.)\\n\\n\r\nIn every episode, thousands of nameless grunts get slaughtered in battle for no apparent reason. Normally I detest that kind of wasteful attitude towards nameless grunts. Even the most disposable of grunts deserve to at least die for some kind of cause the viewer is aware of IMO, but here they're just CGI, so even I don't care about their fate - they could kill millions of them instead of thousands, and it wouldn't make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the name- and faceless grunts die a lot though, the various named faces die a lot too, but since we aren't given enough time to get to know them before they croak it hardly matters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only people that matter here, is the dude, and the girls!\\n\\n\r\nThe dude has godly archery skills and would make Robin Hood donate his bow to the poor and retire in shame. He also has a godly talent for accidentally grabbing boobs and walking in on girls in the nude (even though their hair always covers up the essentials). And that's pretty much all there is to say about him.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls all look like they were designed to give cosplayers an interesting challenge (how do you sew a dress that looks like that without having your boobs fall out?). They come in all boob sizes from D to DDD, and the DDD equipped ones take every opportunity to shame the D equipped ones for their meager endowment. They're all super feisty. And that's pretty much all there is to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nThis review reads as if I was rating it 1/10, but I actually enjoyed it, so I'll give it a six. Maybe you'll enjoy it too, if you have a soft spot for this particular kind of trash. I just wanted to be upfront with what to expect here, so less forgiving people can give it a pass.\\n",

            "content": "Hi! This is the first time for me to write a review, so please bear with me.\r\nRecently (yesterday) I wanted to start watching a new anime. So, i asked the users of MAL to give me recommendations. And oh boy did i miss out on this anime! \r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis Is a story about the middle ages, but then with fantasy; aka with magic, dragons etc. In this anime you follow Tigrevurmud Vorn on his quest to protect his fiefdom.\r\nSo if you like battles with swords, bows and magic, this might be your slice of bacon (I forgot what word was supposed togo there, but i like bacon, so I use bacon).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Plot is not very complicated, so you won't have to crack your brain while watching this. That said, I did found a lot of aspects of this story quite clever. They make excellent use of animations to explain certain events that happen thoughout the story, receiving a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art was great. Shiny fights and explosions are always a nice thing to see. But what really stood out for me was the way they portrayed big battles. seeing big armies clashing with eachother is great, but with great art, it is even better. And that is the case in Madan no Ou to Vanadis, receiving a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n(almost) the first thing you hear from this (or any) anime is the opening song. And i really liked the opening song. It's not your bland OP, and it gave a nice picture of what the anime was about. Also the music used in the anime was very good, receiving a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOften the main problem with anime for me is the main character. Is he likable or not? In this anime, i find the MC very likable, and you get to go through a nice growth with him. This anime isn't really a character development type anime, but that doesnt matter since i found the characters quite interesting to begin with, receiving a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have got to say: I was never bored whilst watching this anime. Even though I did it in one sitting, the show kept my attention the whole time. This anime does not have a lot of humor (though it has a bit), it does not have a lot of character development (though i do not mind since the characters were interesting to begin with) and the plot is not that spectaculair. Still, it managed to entertain me the whole time, receiving a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nadd up those points and you get a 8.4. But for my hopes of getting a second season (which is probably not going to happen) ill give it 0.1 bonus. Rounding it up and i give this anime a 9/10!",

            "content": "First things first, I want to say that I have read the light novel before I watch this show. So, most things I will review is about the adaptation itself. Despite saying that, I still will try to review the show as an anime though I can\u2019t promise it much.\r\nMadan no Ou to Vanadis is a show about a Vorn named Tigrevumurd of a small village name Alsace that is involved in a civil war as a major commander. He asked help from a Vanadis \u2013 A warmaiden whose power is said equal to a thousand soldiers \u2013 named Eleonora Viltaria from another country.Each of Vanadis wield a supernatural weapon, a Dragonic Tools which has their own specialty. This show follows Tigrevumurd or Tigre\u2019s adventure as he defeat each of his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nMadan no Ou doesn\u2019t has a strong premise for me.  A special boy who then involved in a fight and get help from a girl is not a rare premise in nowaday shows. But, what makes Madan no Ou special is how a war and political power plays in the story. You can\u2019t just outplay the enemies in a war by just outnumbering them, history has proved it that tactic and strategy is a deciding factor. I love how the anime shows us the overview of the battle by using a chess-like piece that is put on a map. It is easy to understand the strategy from Tigre and the flow of the battle in a big view by looking at it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the creativity by using the a chess-like piece to explain the strategy, too bad the story pace is really fast. The battle tide which is quick to change make it worse to follow the story. In additions, the fast pace of the story make it hard to know how the dialog of the character can change the war itself. As I said before, Madan no Ou is special because how politic works there. It is hard to know the political power of each character because of the fast pace dialog and the cut on the material if it\u2019s not bad enough.\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the design of Tigre. Simple is best. On the other hand, Vanadis\u2019 design is quite boring. Though it is good, it can not be said as a great design. The antagonists\u2019 design, like Thenardier or the wizard is actually beyond my expectation, they\u2019re great. The animation on battle is really good, it\u2019s clear where they put all of their budget on. Too bad even with good animation, lazy drawings ruin it all. There are several scene where the characters proportional is not balanced and few drawing where the characters posture is weird, especially on battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nOpening and ending song is really what you\u2019ll expect on an action shows. Both of them are nice, really make the mood to watch and ending the show. Then, we have well-made BGMs which make a really great watching experience.  And I have no complain how the voice of each character,  the VAs really did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the dialog of each character is too much compressed. As a consequence, I think we won\u2019t know how the nature of each character really well. The interaction feels a little forced because of it. Fortunately, it\u2019s just the nature of the side characters that didn\u2019t come out well. The main characters\u2019\u2019 nature like Tigre, several Vanadis, and Thenardier can be understood to some extent. Interaction and reaction between main characters at least reasonable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy this series as a whole. Though a fast pace story really ruins it, I love some other aspects such as how good the soundwork and great animation. I don\u2019t think the anime make this series\u2019 charms come out. Despite how I want you to read the light novel rather than watch it to know the charms of this series, I still recommend this anime to you who love action.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "This anime is a special one. Not necessarily in the sense that it does anything in an original fashion but more so in the way it manages to fail being unoriginal. This is pretty impressive in its own right. Now before anything i would just like to say that this anime was most definitely what i would call axed. Now I'm not sure if there planning on having a second season but for now i see no such thing . Therefore for now you should know that a lot of things end up being forgotten and many plot lines just kinda not finishing, maybe leftfor a second season that may never come. Anyways if you're for some reason actually okay with this then lets get on with this extremely serious review to truly analyze this piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nStory - (>- -)>/10\\n\r\nthe story is you're run of the mill generic plot line of fantasy world #807. Basically we all know how this goes. in the beginning the main character the duke of some nothing town gets captured and taken prisoner prisoner by the main heroin. Then things happen and they team up for a reason that will be revealed in the worst plot twist that ever happening ever. Then as our understanding of everything slowly becomes less and less we are introduced to a million plot lines happen that never get wrapped up and by this point nobody cares. \"Oh but wait, isn't this a harem who cares about story i want to watch my 30 yr old virgin fantasies unfold\" well as a 30 yr old virgin in the making (soon i shall ascend to that title) i can tell you that somehow this anime fails in the concept of gathering multiple personality less woman in one place to dote on our main character for no reason. However this doting rarely ever happens and it doesn't even get past blushing. Hell it doesn't even live up to the term ecchi because we get about 2 naked scenes that leave me and my penis with nothing but confusion for we are conditioned to be prepared to be aroused by ecchi scenes yet clearly this is the concept of arousing that a 10 year old child came up with when his friends told him to search up yorick on google because showing naked woman standing around doing nothing is not arousing its actually quite tedious and boring. But then this is also an action anime so maybe that can hold this anime up ... HA \\n\\n\r\nArt/ Animation - (>;_;)>/10\\n\r\nSo this takes the Utawarerumono approach of having a strategic take on things. Something to notice quickly is that a lot of the things that happen in battles are done with narration... \"Well hey at least the strategies are cool and unique\" someone cried in the distance. They found him the next day eaten by dogs. Then we have the fight scenes. Some might call them this I would call them fight power point presentations. In a real life fight scene lazy directors usually show the windup and then the reaction leaving out the part where the attack actually hits the person. This doesn't even show the reaction a lot of the time... we are just left to assume for all we know the character could be slashing a rock, a tree, or maybe the animators themselves. Otherwise there is nothing remotely interesting about the fights and not a single one is worth watching and when you have fight scenes with no fighting your left with... fight nothings... XDXDXDXDXD im going to go kill myself\\n\\n\r\nSound - (opens window)/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - (prepares to jump)/10\\n\\n\r\nWait wait wait. I'm being to hard on myself. If I die my amazing speeling and grammer  and informative anime reviewing abilities go with me. So let's see characters. They existed, i guess. Umm well let's see there was the main character a generally emotionless nothing whose only goal was to have a goal then there were the females. In most harem reviews I would say their only goal was to get in the main characters pants. However none of these characters actually had this goal, hence why this failed as a harem so really what were there goals. Well ummm... to get as many soldiers killed for as little reason as possible... I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - /10\\n\r\nI'm tired. It's pretty late right now. I should probably go take a shower. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - would strongly recommend/10\\n",

Special mentions to the protag as it's the main charm point to this series imo, being that he is an archer, and we don't see enough archer protags, especially as leaders. I did watch the anime before I read the novels, and this review is solely about the anime.\r\nIt's a very solid medieval fantasy anime revolving mostly around a war campaign led by the main character. Since it's a midieval fantasy though, don't expect elves, dwarves, orcs,etc. though dragons do make appearances of course. Very little magic for the most part, some weapons are enchanted and have special abilities though.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly interesting.\\n\r\nFor one, the protag, Tigrevurmud, is an archer, which I find really awesome. MCs almost always use some other type of weapon, since other weapon types are generally more proficient at playing a main role, archers are usually a support role. Swords are the general hero type, fists can work too for alpha type guys usually, staves/magic for the strategist type, there are some others, but that's pretty much it. So seeing a bow is really cool for a MC to me. Especially since he's forced to act like a general... using a bow, which is very exceptional. Even though most leaders can use a bow, none to my knowledge use a bow exclusively in any story.\\n\r\nThe war campaign story really works and keeps you very interested in how battles play out and where the strategy and the main players make a spot in it. We obviously know the main characters will win in the end because Narrative Causality/Plot Armor, but as usual it's the journey/how they win that matters as opposed to the end.\\n\r\nThe pacing is really fast, but I was able to follow even on my first watch what was going on. In my opinion this is probably it's biggest flaw, that the story goes too quickly, it would have made a lot more sense to have the story span 2 cours, but I think the studio did well for what they were trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are pretty decent in general, I like many of the characters. The anime does strip a fair amount of the character development out of most characters, but protag and heroine still get their fair share. A large part of the story is the development of the protag. It's done alright, as we watch him go from a person who can barely lead 100 men, to someone who leads 20,000.\\n\r\nThe other characters are not very fleshed out in the anime, but you can see their general personalities. Again, because of the story's pacing we don't get to see enough of all the characters to really understand many of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the the music, the freaking music, super fitting for the series and it is really good too, I'm going to have to get the OST if it's available because it's too good. It fits the medieval fantasy feel really well. Not much else I need to say.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the OP (I listen to it on its own), the ED is meh though. Your mileage may vary.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is alright, nothing spectacular though. Nothing to complain about, and the important scenes were well animated. The art in general is pretty good, especially when drawing the skirmishes between armies.\\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed the anime, enough to subsequently read the light novels and then watch the anime again. Again, the development and story of the protag, and the action of the campaign he leads, is what really makes me enjoy the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10, the setting and story are good, with the uniqueness of the archer general being a main sell point of the anime. Characters are okay, but the battles, and how the art and sound help accentuate these in the story, are what do the series good. I think anyone looking for a war-centric medieval story will enjoy this one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI do want to mention the adaptation quality. I watched the series, read the LN up to where the anime ends, then rewatched it. The adaptation is pretty good, but condensing FIVE volumes into a 1 cour anime is kinda crazy, A LOT of scenes were left out, but nothing that was really mandatory so I think it's a really good adaptation considering what they were dealing with. The first five volumes cover the whole first arc, so it makes sense to condense it into one series.\\n\r\nNearly all the scenes that were included are accurate, no gecko ending or anything. Things are wrapped up nicely, and if you want to see what other kind of adventures the protag leads, then you can read the LN, but it doesn't leave you off at a point where something big is about to happen, a la NGNL anime.\\n\r\nI think it would have been a better anime if it was 2 cours, as a few of the characters aren't as fleshed out as in the LN, Limlisha in particular. Regardless, I think it's a solid adaptation. Props to Satelight since the goal was clearly to advertise the main series of novels by doing the complete first arc, but either couldn't or didn't want to do a full two cours, perhaps due to budget concerns. I think they managed pretty well considering that.",

            "content": "Before I start, I am reviewing this personally as the anime itself, with no comparison to it's former adaption whatsoever; Light Novel etc\r\nI actually had this on hold for a short moment before freeing up some time to watch it, not a fan of extreme fan service or ecchi in every episode, assuming it had a lot of unneeded content.\r\nThe beginning started off simple with Vorn appearing immediately then seemingly looking like the typical useless Hero playing cool and trying to aim an arrow at a War Maiden, who obviously destroys the arrow. That's how they met, she wanted him as her \"slave/prisoner\".\r\nSkip the boringparts, I actually enjoyed each episode. If you're a fan of strategy and medieval wars mixed with a little (very little) bit of fantasy with dragons, you probably may like this as it's a short and simple series.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't filled with a load of boring talk but a lot of action, with some ice breakers. The battles were crystal but somehow cut short. A 14 year old boy who is a mastermind in war strategies with special hidden powers after inheriting and picking up his family bow, accompanied by a Wind War Maiden. Easy win.\\n\\n\r\nOnly thing I disliked about the series is that she barely explained the history of the War Maidens and paid NO attention to having them appear in several openings throughout all the 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTwo maidens were given the spotlight, one episodes showed a weak and sickly maiden, three episodes showed a maiden used as a messenger, two episodes with barely 1 minute appearance of a maiden with a scythe and one episode with a bi-coloured eyed maiden fighting the wind maiden (Heroine)\\n\\n\r\n... Needless to say, just watch it as it is.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder if they will come up with a second season for this though very unlikely since the ending seemed like the Hero, Vorn would someday become King, and obviously would gain the favour of the people, his knights and the maidens.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever happened to the Duke who left on a ship and was familiar with the maiden Valentina?\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the Prime Minister who seemed uncomfortable with Vorn being given the title Knight of the Moonlight to which anyone given the title has the authority to become the next Ruler of the country.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed like a fair enough closure, leaving viewers assuming that he will be the next King, maybe marrying the Princess with the War Maidens by his side.",

There really isn't much to say because the show was pretty much bad porn without sex, masquerading as a medieval drama sprinkled with politics and battle tactics so lazily thrown in they would have been better off left out and handing via exposition. You know what? I take that back, because that was how the battle tactics were handled. Exposition via diagram, and talking head scenes DURING the battles. Trash.\r\nLike, it's just fucking boobs. If the story and action wasn't shit, I could forgive it, andI often do, but this show is ONLY boobs. That is the only good quality of the show that comes to mind. The only time the big boobs aren't moving are during talking head scenes that explain pretty much nothing to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character designs, they all look like reused designs. I feel like I've seen them all before. It's not like they're actually bad or anything. Just feels unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nThe specific part that hit the nail in the coffin on this one for me was when Obligatory-Blonde-Assistant was bit in the boob by a falling snake from the sky, and it was so obviously so that Not-Kirito-I-Promise-He-Gots-Red-Hair-and-a-Bow could suck on her boob to suck out the poison, which isn't even a valid treatment for that kind of wound and would be useless in the best of cases and aide the venom's spread in the worst.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, save yourself the trouble and go watch a porno. Afterwards you can watch Arslan Senki and see what this show was not really trying to be.",

            "content": "I heard about this anime relatively early on and decided to watch it after the season was finished and done with, so I could watch it all in one go. I only made it through 11 of the 13 episodes because it was easily one of the worst modern anime's I've seen in my growing list. I only watched so far ahead and almost completed the series because I had a vague hope that it would somehow do a 180 degree turn and become something good. But it just progressively kept getting worse to the point of me questioning if I was a masochist forwillfully watching this.\\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10: I would give it a ZERO OUT OF TEN. But it isn't an option. At first glance, as others have said, the story appears to be a run-of-the-mill medieval-fantasy anime, except Ecchi and Harem tagged along with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is completely watchable, but towards the end of the first episode onwards is dramatically poor and cliche-ridden garbage full of overly-convenient coincidences and a blatant bias towards the MC and his merry Harem of jailbait and breast-physics being nigh unstoppable under any circumstances. Even their soldiers are basically unstoppable. \\n\\n\r\nThe only time you EVER see the \"good guys\" soldiers being killed is when the only sane/realistic medieval character decides to cleave people down the middle with an indestructible sword as big as him. And also when the barbaric Arabic pirate army starts to become competent for literally 20 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also stops mid-sentence just to bring you a chess-style recreation of the tactics used by the warring sides during fights, which is interesting... but only serves to emphasize how unrealistically overpowered the MC and everyone under his command are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is the only real redeeming quality of the series. It is extremely fluent and very crisp. They aren't afraid to show violence and blood which adds to the fight sequences, albeit it's 99.9% the enemy being cleaved.  There is also an over-abundance of walking breasts. Even the \"underdeveloped\" character that is introduced and mocked for not having large breasts, actually does have very noticeable large breasts by real world standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The sound was generally well done. Once the \"dragons\" came into play though, everytime you heard a dragon roar it sounded like it was recorded back in 1960 from an amusement park ride. This is severely unnerving when the good sound quality suddenly implodes into something that would make people in the 70's cringe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10: As soon as the series starts, it becomes plainly obvious we are in for a downright terrible MC who is prone to speeches about how he is the ultimate good guy but somehow humble. He is so brazenly painted as the ultimate good guy that it hurts to have him in literally any political discussion, or any discussion at all because it WILL devolve into the latter \"I'm the good guy\" speeches.\\n\\n\r\nHe also suddenly gains the ability shoot deathrays from an Onyx Bow using regular arrows, which are barely short of tactical nukes to the target they are hitting. He is also apparently able to hit targets shooting perfectly straight at them at absurdly long distance despite GRAVITY.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the supporting characters who are in themselves anomalies. The main female protagonist, being labeled a \"War Maiden\", is apparently one of roughly 7 people who inherit Walking-Apocalypse grade weapons that can roughly destroy entire armies without effort. But they don't use them for that, they use them at only rare chances of seeing an opponent that ISN'T human, in a land that is monopolized by humans warring with eachother. If that wasn't enough, the amount of plot-armor handed out is utterly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10: I can honestly say I enjoyed this more than I expected after the episode where the MC is suddenly revealed to be hyper-competent and dramatically overpowered in every single possible way except raw physical strength. The enjoyable part being when it pulled the extremely rare and elusive plot-twist when a \"bad guy\" decides to leave while he's ahead to save everyone's time and effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10: Single handedly one of the worst anime's I've ever seen. The character development is literally non-existent. The MC is a humble, hyper-competent, blatantly overpowered, uber-good-guy that reeks of overly cliche tropes. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting female characters are either walking breasts, moody because they are not walking breasts, or are jealousy ridden because walking breasts are their romantic rival.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guys armies die to a stiff wind, while the good guys are seemingly all walking juggernauts. Especially when they can apparently obliterate entire armies well over 3 times their size while taking minimal casualties in straight-up fighting. This is also dramatically overplayed as well. The good guys are always outnumbered in every scenario, but win anyways because of obscure and overly specific tactics that are too tediously played out to be usable in actual fights.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Avoid this anime at pretty much all costs. Unless you enjoy watching confident and proven military leaders, who outnumber the enemy almost constantly at least 3-1... lose to a hyper-confident, backwater teenager simply because \"He is the Good Guy\" and has unbreakable plot-armor.",

With what i have watched the best shows are where the main characters lose fights.

True the main character is nowa slave but he is only one in title. He can still wander around free within the kingdom which is doesn't convey the feeling of loss as well as it should.

Characters are fucking terrible, MC is a shitty Mary Sue with no personality beyond the fact that he's a nice guy with a bow. I get that it's a shitty harem anime but honestly there is zero characterization for any of the (female only of course) supporting cast either. They could have at least made the girls likable but it's just shoving one pair of tits after another in your face over and over again. The only character with any potentialup till episode 9 was the knight Roland but they did him in just one episode after introducing him, biggest waste if I've ever seen one. Show could have been saved if they had at least done the battles properly but they opted to just show them in the form of shitty chess pieces moving around as the narrator attempted to make sense of the movements and make it seem like there was a degree of tactics involved. The story is completely incomprehensible, don't even get me started on the politics in this show, it's utter horsecrap. Only redeeming factor for this show is that it has a pleasant OP and ED. That's literally all there is to it. After watching 2 or 3 episodes of this show you will have already seen everything it has to offer. Please don't watch this.",

            "content": "This show is a result of the Japanese having sub-par knowledge about European history and culture. If you want to watch for the ecchi or battle harem type stuff then there are better shows to watch out there.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in itself is piss poor and makes zero sense logically. If you ignore every aspect of the story that doesn't make any sense at all then you can probably find some enjoyment in it. \r\nThe gist of the story is a count that for some reason isn't acting like a count or have the skills required to be a count is taken prisoner and for someunexplainable reason is let live by his captors. After his county is attacked by a duke within his country for no good reason he sets out to defend his county by killing everyone that oppose him and allying with his captors. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also some war maidens that only exist of ecchi purposes.\\n\\n\r\nVorn says he cares about Alsace, but after the first battle he could either have let Eleonora annexed his territory or called out to the duke ruling over him. He instead join Thenardier and Ganelon in committing treasonous acts, but unlike the two dukes he seems to wonder why he's branded a traitor after allying with the people they just went to war with. \\n\\n\r\nCombat/tactics:\\n\\n\r\nA major part of this show is supposed to be the combat and the tactics in war. However every single strategy that is used could be bested by a 6 year old with relative ease. Against an archer like the main character a large part of the enemy armies decides against helmets and shields, you know the things that could help against arrows for some mysterious reason. There are people carrying around quails with arrows for Vorn in battle, but largely Vorn is useless in battle. The war maidens seem to be the only ones doing work in battles and an honorable mention to Lim as she's the only character that actually seems to command troops. \\n\\n\r\nHave an overwhelming force facing a tiny army? Let's get a couple thousand people killed and subsequently retreat! \\n\\n\r\nA count for some reason not capable of using a sword. Gains magically powerful bow, fuck that shit. Let's just use a normal one instead and do almost nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe best example of showing how stupid the combat is in this series is by using Vorn vs Thenardier. Big man Thenardier knows he's up against some scrawny kid that doesn't wear any armor and only knows how to use a bow. Let's not wear a helmet! Let's not use a shield! Big man Thenardier could have just thrown a fucking javelin at Vorn and he'd be dead unless he used his haxx bow.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe women are the classic battle harem/ecchi type in falling for the mc for no real reason other than *plot*. \\n\\n\r\nNobody gives a shit about the majority of the soldiers\\n\\n\r\nThe dukes are conveniently both scheming retards incapable of taking down a single count. If Thenardier had a functioning brain he'd just destroy Alsace when Vorn was jacking off doing some dumb shit for no reason and he'd be destroyed mentally, easy win. Ganelon just comes up with some stupid schemes and does nothing noteworthy. \\n\\n\r\nVorn is just a dumb and spoiled pos. If not for the war maidens carrying him he'd be dead during his first fight. Arguably less likeable than Kirito which is quite a feat, but at least Kirito had some value in his series, Vorn has none. He has zero redeeming characteristics.",

However I will not tell you what is the difference like \"Find the Differences\" games nor tell you which one better. I will only use my knowledge from light novel to point out some thing that stands out but not all of it. \r\nStory (9/10)\r\nI put high points on the story because I found some originality in it. There are not many anime which shows oppai and moe girls going on a battlefield to fight, the idea to combine them is good. I ama heavy fans of Dynasty Warrior and Three Kingdoms series, so in my perspective, how the anime tells you the story and how they solved it is pretty realistic, sometimes it is not, but it is not always also. In short, the story gives you a good development that you may not expected.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe quality of the art is great, the color, the details, especially the main heroine is good. It is an eyes candy and makes you delighted. However the design of the troops and armies is on the other hand bad. I know that in an army you need to use an armor and of course except you are a higher ups, you will wear an armor that match each other, however it is just too same and looks like it was copy pasted. However, since the troops and army rarely be shown and just some minor background object, it will not hurt much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nWhen I hear the OP song for the first time, its already makes me addicted and keeps me to replay its TV size one. The ED song also good and give you a relaxed feeling after watching a battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\r\nthe character in this series is refreshing and unique. The tomboyish war maiden (Vanadis) that somehow more dominant. The main hero that still green and trying to become better give a good development, you may see the character is not always goody two shoes and resolve everything just by nice words, sometimes they also take action and makes them a decent character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nI enjoy this series but not enjoyed it to the maximum. Its a story that makes me watch it until the very end. It may not be the best but it gives you a quality time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nIn short, this anime is a good anime and will not make you regret watching it. The character design and personality is good not to mention there is also a good plot to accompany it. Nice OP and Ed song and story telling gives you a feeling how a war is even though you did not go into it. \\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy my review and I am sorry if my English is bad. Thank you!",

            "content": "Summary: This is a fairly typical fantasy anime except that it adds in quite a bit of large scale war and political elements that IMO only detract and generally confuse. It has excellent art and solid sound and characters, but the story is a bit confusing and I found it fairly boring and long winded, even though it only had a single season. One thing I found weird is that it is classified as ecchi/harem but that is mostly not the case. There is very little nudity (if any full topless nudity) and though there is a bit of a love interest between the MCand a few of the war maidens, that isn't really the focus of the story. I guess in that regard it is good, it definitely lets it story shine through, the problem is again that said story is a bit convoluted and boring. Plus there were some elements introduced that weren't followed through on, though my bet was they were at least slightly hopeful for a second season. That said, the story wraps up fairly nicely (though there is definitely room for a sequel) so I feel far less burned than I do during most anime that are cancelled in the middle of the story. I recommend this if you like large scale battles and political strategy in your fantasy anime, but if you're looking for something brainless to sit back and enjoy this might not be your thing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story is solid, but it is just too confusing at times. There were too many places in the world and I didn't really follow the significance of each, so I felt like some of the overarching plots were going over my heart. The micro story isn't too tough, you have war maidens and the MC and they fight a battle to save MC's homeland, but the issue is they go so many places and fight lots of battles and I'm not sure who a lot of the people are and if they are newly introduced or if I should know who they are. It had an ending that, although it was definitely setup for a second season, did a good job of concluding the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is pretty typical high quality art. Character designs were excellent, all of the girls had excellent \"plot points\" and everything was drawn well. The large scale battles used a bit of CG which was fairly seamless and done well. There was a good mix of light and dark and the vibrant mix of colors really made this anime pop.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nA strong soundtrack. The opening and ending these were both very good. The music didn't stand out but it did its job well. There were at least a few songs from the OST that I found enjoyable enough to get, which doesn't happen all that often. Also, the fight scene sounds were high quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main characters were likable, if not a bit tropish. You had the tough girl (harem lead), the tough girls friend/rival who wants MC as well, MC's childhood friend (who happens to be a maid), MC has a heart of gold and just wants to do the right thing, MC has a childhood advisor who means a lot to him... there are a lot of the bases covered. That said, the characters were developed fairly well, if not a little bit shallow. I guess they were planning some interesting character development for the second season (which explains why some of the development was stunted a bit) but I guess we'll never know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is where the story lacked. I normally watch an anime every 3-4 days but this one took me nearly 2 weeks. I could only watch it 1/2 to 1 episode at a time because of the long and sometimes boring story. The politics and maps and confusing amount of side characters could be a bit frustrating. This reminds me of \"Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu\" except what it would have been like if it handled the politics and huge amount of characters in a not so good way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime had a lot to offer. Excellent character design and art, solid sound track and likable characters. If it had shied a bit away from the politics and maps of the land and stuck more to character development and story it might have been a bigger hit for me. That said, if politics and large scale battles are your thing, you might really like this. Plus, really this is just an advertisement for the LN which I've heard is pretty good, so I guess this has accomplished its goal.",

            "content": "Before I start this review, I want to say that I haven''t read the light novel of Madan no Ou to Vanadis, so do not expect any comparison of the two in my review. This review is solely based on only the anime itself.\r\nVanadis (as I will be calling for the rest of the review) is set in Western Europe, during times of war. In a way, the fights and strategies are similar to what was used in real life, but in Vanadis, there are beings known as War Maidens, who are essentially the leader of their respective armies, and have extraordinary powers and abilites,allowing for them to make an immediate impact on any battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is nothing too amazing. Tigrevurmud Vorn, is an archer fighting for his country, Brune. However, during a battle with a War Maiden, he gets captured and is taken hostage, until Eleonora, the War Maiden, sees his skill with the bow and what he is worth, eventually sparing his life in exchange for him to serve under her.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem with Vanadis throughout the series is the pacing. It is very fast paced, to the point where the introductions of the war maidens were cut off, with most of them hardly getting involved with the main plot whatsoever. Also, while the story somewhat revolves around wars and battles, they in my opinion, lacked the tension they need for us to actually care about what's going on in the battlefield. Some battles and individual fights also seem to be cut short, with one gaining the win in an instant at times, building no tension to the battle. From episode 1 to 13, the pacing was just poorly done, and severely damaged the series overall. This issue probably would have been cleared up if the series was split up into two cours, but nope, instead we got what felt like an almost incomplete show with an anti-climatic ending.\\n\\n\r\nOne important factor I have to mention is that during the battles, the scenes are usually interrupted by something called chess wars, which is basically explaining tactics and showing the map of the battle, while replacing the soldiers with mini chess like pieces, all different depending on their own class or what weapon they have. The thing is that, the battles (not including individual fights) are mostly fought on this.. map, with figures... though it did show up less and less as we got to the final episode. I'm personally a bit so-so on this as they could still have shown what was going on without introducing those things. But thankfully, they were short and didn't show up as much in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the art, it's good, but not great. The character designs other than Tigre or some of the war maidens are very lacking. Even Ludmilla, a major character in the story, looked a little bit off at times. (maybe it's just me though) Sometimes faces could look longer than normal, and eyes could even look uneven on minor characters. Thankfully, these issues mostly clear up as we head to the anti-climatic finale. The background itself is good and fitting, however, do not expect anything too outstanding.\\n\r\nThe animation is definitely disappointing in my opinion. While some scenes are animated very well, others could be clunky and choppy. Even in some of the battles, the soldiers sometimes look like they are striking at nothing, but they are made to constantly do it over and over again in the background, which is not all that important, but nonetheless, a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nA final word on the art. If you like fanservice, then Vanadis does not disappoint. The war maidens and a couple of other woman are very busty, some wear a lack of clothing, all their breasts jiggle, and some are even shown nude. So just a heads up for people who either like fanservice or dislike it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks for this anime is nothing too outstanding, but it still does its job at fitting well with the scenes shown. As for the opening theme, I personally loved it, really liked the choir at the back accompanying the lyrics. But as for the voice acting, it disappoints. It isn't bad, but like many have said before, there is always room for improvement. Some sound bland, and couldn't really capture the scene very well,  while some were good, but again, nothing too outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the characters... yes, this was the biggest disappointment for me. As I have said before, in Vanadis, there are a severe lack of character development. The only noticeable one is probably Vorn, but even then, it's not all that praiseworthy. Also to the people who eventually die, it is hard to actually care for them when they have been shown too little to bring out any personality. Furthermore, even the so called war maidens hardly get a development whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\n  The biggest problem of this series for me was that most of the War Maidens barely got any screen time, with the exception of two, Ludmilla, and Eleonora. Hell, some didn't even show up! This is a huge problem because the show is partly about those war maidens and what they are capable of during batles, but it was extremely disappointing to see them barely involved with the main plot whatsoever.  The war maidens themselves mostly had bland personality, while a couple others barely had ANY time to show their personality and goals.  Finally, out of the couple of war maidens that actually showed up, only 3 got involved in battle, which is a shame. (again, this probably would have been much better if this was split up into 2 cours...) And as for the other characters, it's not even worth mentioning them, but they are essentially same as the rest of the characters, with bland personality and no development.\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters themselves are the weakest and the most disappointing part of this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis was disappointing. I've heard many good things about it from others who read the Light novel, and I was honestly expecting something that I was going to be entertained with. However, the series was way too fast paced in general, ignoring much needed developments. They tried to fit all of the war maidens in a such a fast paced show, and they failed miserably. Not only they failed to get developments, but we barely got to know most of them overall. \\n\\n\r\nThis could have been good, but turned into a massive disappointment. There were no outstanding aspects at all, with hardly anything to be called a redeeming factor. Overall, Madan no Ou to Vanadis was yet another anime that could have been good, but isn't, as it fails to solidly execute any aspects that make up an anime. A mediocre show at best, I close off this review with a sigh of disappointment.",

            "content": "War always bring forth the potential for an interesting story.  Between battle decisions, political maneuvers, individual's motivations mixed with the history of the battling countries or organizations, war has so many avenues to tell a story.  In Madan no Ou to Vanadis we are confronted with that same potential at the beginning.\r\nI'm normally very into the shows that have a fantasy setting and while the fantasy setting shown here had a lot of promise, I felt that the show never talked about the lore, explained the lore or even made it clear why everything was going on.  Sure I can connect thedots for the basic reasons people go after individuals, but the best part of the fantasy setting is that you never know which way the story will turn.  Unfortunately the lore is never clarified and it remains a fog that hovers around the story.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite the lack of development with dragon's and war maidens and why other people can harness powers, the actual war campaign is done well.  It is original and at times slightly predictable but overall it was executed well.  The explanations around battle plans was a nice change of pace and the use of chess like pieces simulated a war room or a war council meeting.  It provided a more holistic view of the battle and it allowed me to view certain parts of the show through a different lens.  The show does, however, make some dramatic jumps and at times does not explain all the places that are mentioned.  I still couldn't tell you where some of the places were despite all the maps I viewed during the show.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are fun, but they are not developed, similar to the lore.  The story is written during an age with counts, kings and nobles, so if you dislike people being loyal and polite for the sake of it this show might not be for you.  The partnership that develops between the two main characters is fun, in a silly type of way, but not meaningful.  There is also your dash of fan-service mixed in with the classic focus on breasts as the comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show.  It definitely had some flaws, and I wish the show developed the characters backstory and the lore more, but I looked passed them as I watched the show to see the construction and deconstruction of war.  If you're into medieval war, which some special powers and you enjoy watching someone skilled with a bow (I know I do), then you should try this show out.  If you get frustrated when lore is not thoroughly explained or when characters are superficial this show is probably not for you.",

Unfortunately, it also doesn't have a new thing that stands out that would cause one to desire to watch the series, unless you're into that certain trope. The story was predictable if you've seen anime similar to this. The ending of the anime was a bit sudden as well and it didn't give the audience much time to realize that it ended. The \"final boss\" of the series was also kinda lackluster, in my opinion. \r\nArt: \r\nThe art was very nice. The color palettefor the characters were quite nice on the eyes and if CGI was used, it was hardly noticeable. I especially like the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe characters were alright; they follow many of the trope that are already present and aren't too memorable. The main character mainly remained flat in terms of character development throughout the series until near the end. Near the end, he did undergo a slight bit of development, but aside from that, the characters of the series hardly change. But despite that, they weren't bad characters you couldn't stand. Nor were they outstanding, though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI personally did not enjoy it, because the concept has been done many times before. If you like anime similar to this, you'll probably like it and get a kick out of it. But I personally did not like it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThe concept has been done before and nothing too new can be seen in this series. The series had nice art, character designs, and production overall. But in terms of plot, character development, originality and such, this series is passable and forgettable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "It's quite hard for me to explain the plot for the series. I kindly recommend you for reading the plot in MAL, but still, I'll try to make a short explanation regarded this series. It happens on the time when war settles everything, the territory, ownership, status, wealth, and so on. Based in Europe, divided into five kingdoms which the hero and heroines come from Brune and Zchted, two kingdoms famous for its wealth. The hero is, Vorn Tigrevurmud, a skillful archer rules Brune kingdom got caught up in a circumstance which makes him a captive of Zchted kingdom under~the heroine~surveillance named Eleonora Viltaria whois a Vanadis. As the story goes, the hero and heroine form a sensible contract, between the name of Brune and Zchted prosperity and the story of war among countries starts.\\n\\n\r\n    I'll start from both the graphic or art and story I guess. Well, the story is not the typical one, many others series had amuse us with story within the times of war. Also, it's quite hard to remember all the names since it's not presented in our everyday lives. But bet me the story is as powerful as the Vanadis here. It gets its own theme for supranatural power and it is one of the charm that can be denied. Tho' I feel a bit unpleasant for the colouring because from my point of view it looks like a deep colouring of paintbrush, too deep, even the light colour seems weird when applies.\\n\\n\r\n    You can enjoy and guessing how the story will go and what kind of tactics are going to use by the main characters in war. And once again, the joy will be~somewhat~disturbed when the war scene begins, a scene to explain the tactics they use in war appears in form of chessboard-like. The usage of explaining tactics with that way both advantaging and disadvantaging the viewers. The advantage is, of course, we can understand clearly the moves, the plans, the tactics they use in war, while the disadvantage is this chessboard thingy will make the enjoyment of watching the war scenes bothered.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Madan no Ou to Vanadis is an anime that had all the pieces to create an excellent anime but clearly failed due to lack of budget and and a rushed adaptation. On top of that, the \"narrator\" that the anime makes use of to explain strategy and battle situations in every episode was extremely annoying and detached you from the fantasy the anime created. The only reason the narrator was remotely necessary was because of just how rushed the anime was as the anime did't have time to \"show\" the strategy or what took place between episodes and had to resort to \"telling\" instead.\r\n{Story} -The idea behind Vanadis is probably one of its strongest areas and it could have been developed into something great. Unfortunately being only a one cour anime, everything was extremely rushed and the story felt disjointed and very shallow. There were many references to characters in the story that never appear due to time constraints or are given extremely limited (literally one scene) appearances. Ultimately while the story had promise it failed to deliver a show that had you craving for the next episode due to its rushed pace.\\n\\n\r\n{Art} - The art in Vanadis was pretty mediocre. With the quality of anime coming out these days, the bar is set pretty high and Vanadis didn't meet that expectation. There are a lot of clipped scenes, poor animation, and repeated scenes. The show only gave each war maiden one or two abilities and seeing those abilities repeated over and over every episode really draws away from the visual effect.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - As with the art, the sound and music in the anime were pretty mediocre. Nothing stood out as a wow moment and the things that first caught your ear on their first use became very repetitive as the show made use of the same abilities and tactics time after time.\\n\\n\r\n{Character} - As with the story, the characters in Vanadis had a lot of promise but they were severely hampered by the rushed pace and short anime length. Some characters that were introduced were given zero time to show any character progression and others were introduced but the never followed up on. The anime supposedly has seven different war maidens but we're only introduced to six and only three are given any meangingful screen time. Even within those three, only two are really fleshed out as characters while the other one's reason for helping the main character's group is rather vague. Unfortunately what could have been a great story with great characters fell flat due to the extremely rushed pace.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - The anime left a lot to be desired. Unlike many great anime that I have watched, I didn't feel the need to watch the next episode right away. I even forgot I was watching the anime for a few days before seeing a picture of the main character online. Again, the anime had a lot of potential but ultimately fell flat and the enjoyment level really suffered from this. I still did enjoy it while I was watching it but it never left me wanting more.\\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave this anime a 5/10 - one of the lowest scores I've given out on my animelist and in a review. The pacing and rushed feeling in Vanadis was such a huge detractor from the anime that I could never really enjoy it. There were a few bright spots in the anime but even those were rushed and pushed aside to hurry to the next plot point of the anime.",

The lady leader may say things resembling to a strategical conversation, but I tell you, as a whole, it just doesn't make sense, since from the start it's what it is, and so no matter how much they show their intelligence, the story just isn't.\\n",

            "content": "I actually enjoying this anime anime a lot. It is not exactly special, and it ends a bit inconclusively (it is almost as if there was supposed to be a second season), but somehow it reminded me of Spice And Wolf (although Spice and Wolf was better), and I found it to be a bit calm and relaxing. However, due to fairly high body count in battles, blood and occasional dismemberment, I'm not sure if that's what creators were trying to do.\r\nDetailed breakdown below.\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nIt is a one long storyline, speaking about a small kingdom and its ruler who is an archer of godly skill.One things go after another, and story follows the kingdom and characters go through series of battles and conflicts. Those battles and conflicts are portrayed indifferently, and the narrative often takes step back to describe battle details, or to explain some bits of the lore. IN a sense, it is a bit similar to what Youjo Senki were trying to do with its strategic maps, however, in Youjo Senki political and strategic episodes felt forced, boring and out of place, and here they're interesting to watch. Overall, it almost looks like a medieval slice of life road trip kind of story, even similar to spice of wolf (although spice and wolf was more dramagic and spent more time discussing economics). Which is - if you think about it - a bit weird, because there are battles and quite a lot of unnamed warriors die in the background. Still I found the story interesting, aside from that one place where it suddenly pulled 5 deus ex machinas in the row.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nAverage or slightly above it. Colorful backgrounds and characters, drawn in modern anime style (triangular faces and stuff). Level of detail is a bit low, but not as bad as in, say.... \"Taimadou Gakuen 35\" or Mahouka.There's quite a lot of CG being used - for battles, armies, etc, mostly it does not stand out too much, but there was that one scene where I seriously wondered what the heck is that CG soldier doing in background. So, art works for the anime, and it isn't horrible. Characters are visually/cutish side as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound(5/10):\\n\r\nIt is good overall, and there's medieval tune that plays at the end of every episode during preview... which I liked a lot. However, on occasion the anime started played some soundtrack that felt seriously out of place, mostly during battles. That one was annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(5/10):\\n\r\nBecause the anime appears to be trying to display events from a bit of distant perspective, they're not very well portrayed, and do not have much opportunity to display their individual traits. Villains were a bit too far into \"cliche villain\" territory and were annoying. Protagonist and his companions are portrayed a bit better, but they're somehow displayed in almost neutral fashion, barely getting any chance to display their personalities. I mean they show their quirk or two from time to time, but you don't get attached to characters, and don't feel very compelled to sympathize with them. You jsut sorta watch the story unfold on a big scale. The only thing of note is that Main Heroine's character is very similar to that of Medaka from Medaka's Box. And that's about it. Characters aren't horrible, but it feels like they could use more effort.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement (6/10):\\n\r\nI liked it due to the a bit calm of atmosphere which reminded me of Spice and Wolf. However, given amount of battles, this may not be what the anime was supposed to be, so your mileage may wary.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line:\\n\\n\r\nI'd say it is worth checking out if you have the time, or want some sort of medieval world which is not heavily magical and which is not another \"we're now a computer game\" kind of story. Basically - a more serious kind of settings than, say the one in KonoSuba. If you pick it up you'll see battles, kingdoms, occasional maps discussing some strategic moves, and few light jokes. Occasionally aniem tried to get tragic and serious, but didn't succeed much at it (although results weren't cringe-worthy either).\\n\\n\r\nYou decide if this is what you want or not. Although this title is no masterpiece, I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "I will try to be as unbiased as possible considering I already read the light novel which is much better than the anime. The story is okay although a person who has not read the light novel will be confused. There are many subtle hints of whats really going on, especially the true agenda of Duke Ganelon and Duke Thernadier. The art is fair and they did a good job of portraying the battle by switching to a narration of what is happening across the battlefield. I was confused by the what the Muozinel soldiers were doing in battle. They seemed to be waving theirswords around and doing a really weird dance. I just put it down as them taunting Tigre and Mila. The music and sound is okay since they weren't outstanding or anything like that. I do like the characters and how they interact but there isn't a lot of character development. I enjoyed the anime even though the anime kind of botched the whole story. Overall, the anime is not outstanding nor is it poor. It's really good if you are bored and want to something to watch. I REALLY recommend reading the light novel. That is all.",

            "content": "FULL DISCLOSURE: I have not read the manga/light novel for this. \r\nBased on the MAL average scores I was hoping for a more. I like fantasy-action-ecchi-harems as much as anyone else, so I see anything above a 6 and I'll give it a shot. However, I also like my shows with some humor.\r\nANIMATION + ART:\r\nThe art itself is standard fare for the genre. Nice scenes and backgrounds, standard hotties, etc. The character designs are good, but not the best in the genre. I particularly like the building and city designs.\r\nThe overall animation is 'meh' though, with some of the battles entirely replaced with little chesssets showing the strategies. This wouldn't be a bad thing on its own, but the fact that the actual battles are shown mostly using this method makes them underwhelming. Other battle scenes are replaced with 3D CGI \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to animate hundreds of horses either, but with some better scene placement it wouldn\u2019t be necessary. It's clear that resources were cut here. \\n\\n\r\nSome notable person v. person battle scenes stand out from the rest of the show, but in the big picture they are only average for this genre. Together with the character designs, it gives off a bit of a Fire Emblem vibe.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other shows out there with more mouth-flapping scenes, but something of this genre deserves more attention in that regard. There is not quite enough time spent on the individual battles in this show, so I\u2019m lead to believe that the studio was trying to cover far too much material in a short 11- to 13- episode season. Comments on the series seem to back this up, claiming that the anime skipped out on a lot from the manga/light novel.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are decent, though I'm not really a fan of either intro or outro - that's just my taste. Half of the in-show music feels off-theme but matches the moment-to-moment mood.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nI like anime that is able to answer all or most of my \"why\"- and \"how\"-questions as I follow along, and this one just doesn't do it. There is so little justification for anything that is going on. And when it does come, it\u2019s just too late.\\n\\n\r\nDropped into the story knowing very little and in the important early-episodes period I really don't sense any motivations from anyone except for the generic \"I want to save my homeland\" lead, the \"I love you because you are sooo skilled and you killed my soldiers, but who cares!\" hotties, and the \"I'm evil so I want to take over the world\" 1-D bad guys. The characters bring in slightly more depth later on, but in such a short series it comes too late.\\n\\n\r\nMany transitions are thoughtless and weak. Whenever a new plot element comes into play, it is just dropped right in with very little information presented beforehand. Even if some of the circumstances had been subtly mentioned in the background it would have made a huge difference. It feels as though the author did not have any plan whatsoever when beginning the story \u2013 though more likely it\u2019s the fault of the screenplay director here.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the microscale interaction and macroscale battle tactics, there is very little mention of the politics of the numerous name-dropped nations, cities and locations. I had to go on to the fandom wiki in order to put meaning behind any of the various dropped-names. \\n\\n\r\nThe material is condensed in such a way that there is little build-up for twists or climaxes, leaving the story dull and tedious. The animation is lacking in little detail scenes that so much other anime has and gives the impression that no thought was put into controlling the tension.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the occasional ten seconds of mourning, there is a lot of needless death that is just completely glossed over. The mood is far too desensitized to seem authentic in a history-strategy sense. Here the lack of higher justification makes the characters unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nI'm no tactician, so I can't say much about that, but they seemed somewhat passable. If you like tactics and can deal without a harem, I enjoyed \"Nejimaki Seirei Senki: Tenkyou no Alderamin\" much more than this.\\n\\n\r\nWith the setup of the final arc and the number of unused characters, the show demands a second season. In that case, the fact that all of the material was condensed in such a way leads me to believe that the anime adaptation was meant as a desperate money-grab. It\u2019s sad really. If the beginning had been better justified, it would have been a much better series. After taking a break before watching the last three episodes, the show was much more enjoyable with the end of the season feeling much better written and more purposeful.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the final showdown is pitiful. Oh, so is the rush ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not awful but the handling and pacing really mess things up.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nStandard forgettable hotties and standard OP lead. Some good screencap material but not as much as you would think. Most characters are super flat and predictable. Voice acting is nothing special. Character depth appears to increase somewhat towards the final arcs, but nothing is different with the characters in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem itself is weak too. Nothing makes it stand out from notable others.\\n\\n\r\nA great show doesn\u2019t need to spend too much time directly giving you information to build that characters but instead is constantly subtly conveying to you the information necessary to make your own judgement. This show just has the characters saying generic statements that clearly reveal their archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThe tactics are somewhat interesting, but as I said before, there are more interesting tactical displays elsewhere. I like the Fire Emblem-like feel of some parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem interaction only occasionally plays out but it is too strongly forced and unjustified for to be enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThis show's next strongest demerit is its lack of humor. I honestly think that low budget productions shouldn't bother to take on stories that try to take themselves so seriously. Ecchi-harems do much better with even basic humor to the point that otherwise weak stories can be enjoyable for me (Trinity Seven), but this one just doesn't do it. \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc or two were the only ones I found enjoyable \u2013 decently so, well\u2026 at least until the insulting final showdown. It\u2019s too bad the earlier arcs were as weak as they were. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe lack of humor was the final straw. A darker direction with much more thought put into it could have been a good alternative. I would be much more invested in the characters if they would open up in at least some kind of way beyond the easy preset pathways.\\n\\n\r\nIn absence of other merits, the story just isn\u2019t strong or well-thought out enough to be fully interesting. If it wasn\u2019t for my completionist nature, I would have dropped after the third or fourth episode - hence the need for a stronger introduction phase.\\n\\n\r\nIn a short season, it is not a good idea to cram lots of intended material into one space if the characters are to have any depth at all. More time should be spent developing the reasons behind individual characters\u2019 justifications. The details count.\\n\\n\r\nFear not! There are better options out there!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: \\n\r\nToo much material, too little time, no tension, semi-lazy animation, shallow characters, and weak harem, but decent tactical display and art. If you\u2019re in it for the hotties, then go for it. If you are impatient, just watch the last arc or two.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Exposition central, dropped on the 5th episode. It doesn't establish any emotional attachments and it has some questionably lengthy action frames which I thought would have been better executed if they were a couple of seconds faster and got to the point. I wouldn't consider this to have any sort of genre defining emotions, it's more like a blank slate. If you're coming from Sword Art Online or Re:Zero or any anime of that emotional quality, this will do absolutely nothing to maintain your attention. The first and second episodes were surprisingly good and I would say were the strongest episodes of the five thatI had watched but it immediately tanks from there.",
