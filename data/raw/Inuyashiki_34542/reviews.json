            "content": "July, 2000. A man named Hiroya Oku revealed to the world with his skills through his infamous sci-fi, horror Gantz. The manga ran over 300 chapters and ended in 2013. It was a time when the man really made a name of himself in the manga community. An anime adaptation aired between April and November 2004. That was over a decade ago. Now, the man has made this new work called Inuyashiki, a title that honestly piqued my interest more than I had expected. However, did it really live up to the hype?\r\nTo be clear, Inuyashiki has nothing to do with Gantz or in factany way similar. However, it\u2019s clear from day one that the author wanted the viewers to experience something memorable. Through his craft, it is accomplished with our two main guys \u2013 titular character Ichiro Inuyashiki and the sociopath Hiro Shishigami. I don\u2019t want to jump the gun here but these two characters are on complete antithesis of each other; like two sides of a coin, ying and yang.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a certain mysterious incident from the first episode, we find out that Ichiro and Hiro develops mysterious powers that could change mankind forever. This show establishes the two characters from the first two episodes through their actions and personality. Ichiro is portrayed as a timid old man who has a hard time making friends. However, it\u2019s shown that he has a heart of gold and works to help others. He puts others besides himself and often takes high risks with calculated chance. On the other hand, there\u2019s Hiro. To put it simply, this guy is a sociopath that walks as a demon in human form. He appears to be kind and respectful but his true personality is much more complex as viewers soon discover. Throughout the show, it\u2019s easy to see that he has a God-like complex of himself. He uses his powers to kill others simply for the thrill and because he can. It\u2019s not entirely known how he developed his personality but a look at his storytelling in relation to his family and school life may have attributed to this. However, Hiro is not entirely devoid of humanity. It\u2019s shown that he deeply cares about his mother and also had a friend named Andou that he occasionally defends from bullies. Later on in the series, Hiro also meets a girl who harbors feelings for him that he grew to accept. That being said, I think Hiro represents the worst of humanity. Through his killings, Hiro confesses that he \u201cnever felt so alive\u201d while he does so. In other words, Hiro kills with little reason besides to feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe creator of the series obviously tries to get viewers to feel something and to be honest, it works. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s intriguing to see the storytelling from both sides. While both Hiro and Ichiro uses violence, they use it for completely different reasons. While Hiro feels alive through killing, Ichiro feels alive through saving others. It\u2019s actually quite relatable too to our today\u2019s society. There are these type of people living in our world. Psychopaths exists and so do heroes. You probably hear about them on the news every day. However, Hiro makes the news for the wrong reasons and it becomes clear that he wants to experiment with his powers and show off his God complex. While this all seems like nonsensational drama, it does actually does work as the show is able to use its violence to full effect. From police massacre to destruction of aircrafts, it gives his insight on what Hiro is truly capable of and how far he goes to prove his point. Additionally, this show also adds a bit of dark humor through the usage of 2chan and other social media drama. My experience from this show made me realize that Hiro and Ichiro really shows what humans are capable of when they are given powers beyond the natural law of order. Ichiro proves that he can use powers to great responsibility to save others and it can be inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships throughout the show can be taken in several ways. Hiro\u2019s relationships can elicit various emotions such as with his mother, Andou, and Shion. They are people he actually cares about although as the story progresses, circumstances begins to change. For Ichiro, I honestly feel sorry for him. The closest friend he has is his dog. He has an ill relationship with his family and even his daughter doesn\u2019t seem to respect him. However, I will say that Ichiro is a man of integrity. Even at age 58, he hopes to make a difference in his world after developing his powers. He accepts them like a God\u2019s blessing rather than using it as a weapon. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say other character relationships in this show is well developed. I can\u2019t really find Shion or Andou memorable at all throughout the series and they hardly influence my enjoyment. On the other hand, the manga itself is well adapted with even references alluding to other manga such as One Piece. I can safely say that the overall tone of the psychology remains impactful. While the show can come off as edgy at times through its violence, it really knows how to use them.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio MAPPA, Inuyashiki\u2019s quality is about as good as it can get. The first few episodes showed that it has the capability of handling CGI. Character designs are also really interesting to take note that shows the frail innocence of Ichiro and deceptive handsomeness of Hiro. The overall setting of Tokyo remains consistent with our modern time. However, what\u2019s really to take notice is the action and violence. To be clear, the violence is over the top especially in later episodes. There\u2019s massive amounts of blood, body parts being blown off, and gunfights. There\u2019s little censorship so expect it to be thrown right to your face. On the other hand, it\u2019s unfortunate to say but I think MAPPA overestimated itself this year. In later episodes, some of the quality suffers such as the flight scenes and pure action movements. \\n\\n\r\nVisually aesthetic and extravagant in style, Inuyashiki\u2019s OP song \u201cMy Hero\u201d by MAN WITH A MISSION is among one of the most memorable of the year. The overall tone and just the imagery itself is filled with creativity and hard to duplicate. However, the voice mannerism of the characters can be a mixed bag. It took me some time to accept Hiro\u2019s voice as his personality became easier to understand. Ichiro\u2019s voice is that of an old man and even harder to accept. The OST is moody although can be emotional at the appropriate times or eerie when impactful events happen.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki turned out to be quite an experience to be honest. From the very first episodes, I was hooked by what it had to offer and the characters were well worth investing into. It didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cgood vs evil\u201d generic story as we explore the depths of human psychology. While I can\u2019t say this anime is recommendable to anyone, it will be one to remember for years to come. A show like Inuyashiki proves that psychological sci-fi fillers are still a draw in the anime world.\\n",

            "content": "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It\u2019s a flying Grandpa!\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s rather counter-intuitive to even mention this, considering how much we actively consume as fans of this medium, but anime is\u2026 strange. It\u2019s a medium in which vigorously seems to try and go against societal norms; a medium not afraid to cover taboo or heavy topics such as incest or depression, and covers such a myriad of different ideas and themes that if someone were looking for something incredibly specific from a piece of media, they\u2019d probably find their incredibly niche want within anime. This is the main reason why I chooseto persist as much as I do within this medium, not only since I enjoy strange pieces of media to begin with, but also because I can get stories and concepts in anime that I can\u2019t get anywhere else, such as Haibane Renmei and The Tatami Galaxy to just name a few. I\u2019m always looking out for something that is incredibly bizarre; something to fill that sensation I have to watch weird media, and the people over at MAPPA gave me what I was indeed looking for in the form of Inuyashiki (aka Flying Grandpa Simulator), a show in which a 58-year-old grandpa becomes a cyborg, with a multitude of different abilities, one of which being flight, as he becomes a vigilante of justice, protecting the weak, and curing people of their disease. Inuyashiki is a strange series and one in which I\u2019m not quite sure where the writers were going with this story. For what I believe was supposed to be a moralistic battle against good and evil while presenting ideas of what it means to be human instead devolves into full-blown dumb shlock, and I loved every second of it! Don\u2019t get me wrong, this show is bad. Quite bad in fact. But Inuyashiki has become one of my favourite guilty pleasures in anime with a concept and aesthetic so silly that I can\u2019t take any of it seriously, even when it\u2019s clear I am supposed to at times. Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki Ichirou, our senior male fantasy empowerment for this tale (laugh track at my totally original and clever joke) is not exactly having the greatest of times. Aside from looking much older than he actually is, his entire family resents him, for seemingly no reason. He has no affection for his wife, as they sleep in different rooms of the house, and his children also give him no time of day at all. To make matters worse, Inuyashiki receives unfortunate news that he has got terminal cancer, and, feeling that he can\u2019t tell anybody about this, keeps it to himself, suffering in silence all the more than before. After a trip to the park to cry alone, suddenly, ALIENS! For no reason, and without any explanation at all, aliens accidentally kill both Inuyashiki and a man standing next to him, our main antagonist for this tale, Hiro (who just so happens to be standing next to him for some reason, but whatever). Realising their mistake, the aliens then rebuild both men, turning them into cyborgs in the process! While Inuyashiki uses his newly found powers for good, Hiro uses it for murder, as the rest of the series sees Hiro running from the police and becoming a bigger threat, with Inuyashiki trying to find him with the help of Andou, the once friend of our villain, who wishes to stop his murderous cyborg pal, leading to Inuyashiki\u2019s and Hiro\u2019s inevitable fight at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Grandpa Simulator is fundamentally a tale of good versus evil, with each character\u2019s respective ideologies being as basic as they come. Inuyashiki is the good guy, Hiro is the bad guy. While they do try and provide some introspection into Hiro\u2019s character and the reason why he kills (which I\u2019ll get into a little bit later in this review) this basic set-up is what allows Inuyashiki to be so damn senseless and fun! Flying Grandpa\u2019s narrative is incredibly silly and over the top, but there was not a single moment in the entire show where I was bored and not laughing my ass off at how ridiculous the show could get at times, with the basic good versus evil narrative providing an amusing framework for all the stupid stuff that happens in the show. This acted as an incentive for me to keep watching, just to see what the writer would think up next, and he never failed to entertain me on that front. The show is constantly trying to one-up itself every step of the way, with the narrative becoming more and more cheesy and ludicrous as it goes along, with Hiro proclaiming that he will kill everyone in Japan and even beginning to see through on this proclamation as he takes to the city buildings, and from there, kills hundreds with his finger banging, being the icing on the schlock-filled cake! The anime is all over the place, and the pacing, in particular, is so fast, that it actually works in favour of the show from an entertainment standpoint. One moment we see Inuyashiki flying through the skies accompanied by silly cartoon slapstick music, and then the very next episode we see him infiltrate a yakuza hideout, blind every single person there, and leave completely shirtless (not to mention that in the start of that very same episode, a Yakuza boss walks into a sauna completely naked and forces another guy to give him fellatio!)\\n\\n\r\nEven just all the little strange details the show includes makes it so enjoyable to watch as a piece of shlock for me. Such as is the case of the cyborg bodies of both Inuyashiki and Hiro. Not only is the prospect of seeing an old shirtless man flying through the air one that cracks me up, but the fact that this body, which was created by aliens, includes a USB port under one of the fingernails in order to connect it to an iPhone is such a  stupid thing to include, that I burst out laughing when it happened! I guess Aliens also use USBs to connect their iphones to various other devices too?!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we still haven't got to my favourite element of the cyborg bodies: finger banging! By just simply forming their fingers into the shape of a gun, much like a kid back when I used to play when I was like six-years-old, and then shouting \u201cBANG\u201d they fire off an invisible bullet of sorts, or, in Hiro\u2019s case, using his entire arm to mimic a machine gun while screaming \u201cDADADADADADA\u201d when firing at a bunch of reporters. Just the idea of comparing Hiro playing with guns to that of a child is one that I found so hilarious, but it ultimately falls in line with Hiro's ideology and mindset; he too, thinks in the same rationality as a child would, so it does make sense within the context of his character to act as such.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki\u2019s narrative is comparable to that of a cheesy science fiction and seems to almost revel in that fact. However, there were some elements and ideas present here, that were actually not completely schlocky, that I thought were kind of interesting. Take, for example, where Hiro hijacks people\u2019s phones and TV screens in order to murder them. It\u2019s nothing great, sure, but I liked this idea since it meant that the killer could appear anywhere, at any time, striking people when they are at their most vulnerable, which added a whole new dimension of tension to those scenes in which Hiro goes on a rampage. It's an interesting concept to take a device which is so engraved in our everyday lives and present it as the biggest threat to our survival. However, despite as such, I would be lying if I said that much of my own enjoyment for Inuyashiki\u2019s narrative is indicative of the schlock and stupid premise, which, while entertaining to watch to kill some time, doesn\u2019t offer much besides that. It\u2019s the type of show to watch drunk or high to get the most out of. If you\u2019re looking for something that comments on the true nature of what it means to be human with themes of existentialism and the such, then you will find no such thing here.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of your level of enjoyment of this show stems from whether you enjoy watching bad schlock, and if you can just turn your brain off (since, when you begin to think about each of the world-building elements and ideas then your brain will hurt since nothing makes any logical sense) and just watch all the stupid carnage unfold before your eyes. I had a blast watching Inuyashiki, clearly, and I think that\u2019s worthy of praise if a show can be entertaining, even if that show is indeed bad, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse all the poor writing the show seems to thrive in and the multitude of problems it has. One of the most prolific, and the one that would probably put people off from watching the show altogether is the strange tonal shifts the show has, going from goofy hijinks with an old man attempting to fly, to the straight up murdering of young children and babies. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the second episode of the show, which shifts to the point of view of Hiro, our antagonist, something the show does rather frequently during its run. At the end of this episode, Hiro walks into a random stranger\u2019s house, and murders everyone inside, including a small child who is sitting inside a bathtub, as his father cries and pleas for his life, but Hiro finger bangs him regardless. This surprised a lot of people who were not familiar with the manga, including me, since it came so far out of left field, and the show has quite a number of these moments. The killing of children comes across as rather tasteless and a pathetic attempt to seem edgier than it actually is; it\u2019s essentially shock factor, which reminded me a lot of Elfen Lied, albeit nowhere near as extreme as that show, which tried to hide behind a veil of being deep and mature. Inuyashiki has an air of dumb fun and seems to almost partake in making fun of how ridiculous it can be at some points in the show, to the point where it feels that the original writer had just as much fun writing this insane story as I had consuming it. Although, there were a few moments in the show in which I believe were supposed to make the viewer feel sad, or perhaps tense, regarding those moments were people are killed, but I was having just as much fun with those scenes as I would any other in the show, and it\u2019s this strange juxtaposition of what I believe the writer intended an audience to feel, and what I felt, that makes any serious moment fall apart in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has this strange tendency to randomly cut to a character who has no bearing on the overall plot at all, such as a working woman with terminal cancer or a woman on a plane visiting her family. This comes across as jarring and bizarre since the characters are completely inconsequential to the plot, and the show spends a good five to ten minutes on each respective character; it feels like needless padding just for the sake of such. While it does make sense in one or two instances, such as in episode four where we are introduced to two characters who are linked directly to the plot of that episode, which is what triggers Inuyashiki to go and infiltrate that Yakuza hideout I talked about a moment ago, most of the time it just feels worthless, and if it were cut entirely, nothing would be affected. I suppose the point of these random digressions in the narrative is to showcase what the public is thinking and to gain an insight into how Inuyashiki\u2019s efforts are saving people\u2019s lives, but it still feels unnecessary. The ending for the show too, while I won\u2019t get into specific details about it, isn\u2019t exactly the greatest in the world either, and may leave you feeling somewhat irritated as a result, although it didn\u2019t personally annoy as much as it did with others.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Flying Grandpa Simulator are probably the weakest part of the series and feel more so like one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs than actual fleshed out people. First of all, there is Inuyashiki, our protagonist of this tale; a weak and timid old man who, despite working full time to support his family, receives no love or affection for all his hard work. All of Inuyashiki\u2019s family are just so cruel to this poor old man, for seemingly no reason at all! While it is implied that Inuyashiki\u2019s son resents his father because he is being bullied at school because of his poor family income, he still treats his father as if he were a stranger! Perhaps it can be excused since he is young, and being bullied or something along those lines, but his resentment towards his father just comes across more as trite and forced, to manipulate the audience into feeling sympathetic towards Inuyashiki. The show does try to explore the history behind Inuyashiki\u2019s daughter, however, Mari, whereupon we see that as a kid Mari cared for her father dearly, following him about everywhere and crying that he would pass away soon since he looked far older than he was. However, as she grew into adolescence, Inuyashiki explains to Andou that he has not spoken with his own daughter for years now, as she seems to actively try and avoid him at all costs, and it\u2019s never explained why she does this, nor why she holds resentment towards her father. It\u2019s kind of implied that she is trying to prove something to him, that being that she wants to draw manga, but the show doesn\u2019t give any clear insight into why she dislikes her father as much as she does, making her feel more like a one-dimensional twat if anything else. While in the penultimate episode of the show she does once again begin to love her father as before, there\u2019s not really any build-up to this event, aside from one moment in which Inuyashiki, in a conversation with Mari and her mother about her future, says that she should be allowed to pursue what she wishes, that is, drawing manga, or the few scenes where she was following her father around as he cured the sick in various hospitals, but her sudden change regarding her opinion of her father comes so far out from left field and feels jarring as a result.\\n\\n\r\nI expected a bulk on Inuyashiki\u2019s character arc to be centred around him growing in confidence with this new found body and sorting out the various issues with the rest of his family, but that never really happens, nor is any justification given into why his family dislikes him as much as they do. While, certainly, Inuyashiki himself does seem to grow in his confidence, as he finally finds purpose in his life, and a reason for why he was born in the first place, as evident by his monologue in the penultimate episode in which he goes from person to person saving their lives, or healing them from their wounds, in a scene that actually had some heart to it, I wouldn\u2019t say his character is anything substantial or even close to good. He simply represents the human side of the two newly-created cyborgs and that is it. Speaking of such, this leads me to the next character, Hiro, the antagonist of the series, and the representation of the loss of humanity when one becomes a cyborg. Hiro\u2019s character, and the arc he embarks on (or lack thereof) centres around his loss in humanity, as he has to kill others in order to feel human once again, childishly playing a game to determine which house he will enter next to slaughter those who lay within it. Hiro is just a complete psychopath with no emotions or empathy, asking women if they enjoy One Piece while their entire family has been killed! While the show does try and convey this theme of what it truly means to be human regarding Hiro\u2019s character, it falls flat on its face since it\u2019s heavily implied that Hiro was a complete psychopath even before becoming a cyborg, as we learn that as a child he killed small animals and the such. This completely negates all the attempts the narrative has to present Hiro as a victim of circumstance; as a victim of losing his own humanity which acted as the justification he had for killing people, and makes all the moments in the show in which he is breaking down and crying over someone he loved feel all the more ridiculous, as I can\u2019t feel any sympathy towards someone who kills children! His character has no chance to reflect on the misdeeds he has done in the past, nor do we really get a chance to delve into the psychological implications his murdering is having on himself, which just makes him feel more so like a psychotic murderer and nothing else. I don\u2019t believe this is inherently a bad thing, and it works in the show\u2019s favour regarding its shlock value as I mentioned before, but it makes Hiro\u2019s character uninteresting. Simply put, he is the bad guy and must be stopped. Nothing more. Nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in the show are either just one-dimensional assholes, such as a group of kids in the very first episode who fire fireworks at some poor homeless man, a group of thugs, who, when told they shouldn\u2019t push in front of the line for a taxi by a middle-aged businessman, then escort said man to a park twenty minutes away just to beat the hell out of him because they\u2019re just that EVIL, or random kids making fun of a woman with cancer just to make her all the more miserable, or they\u2019re absolute dumbasses! Every person in the world of Inuyashiki is so damn dumb that I wonder how they even know how to properly breathe! Okay, let\u2019s first discuss Shion, who, after the news is revealed that Hiro is a murderer, and is thus on the run from the police, allows Hiro to stay with her and her Grandmother in her house as a means of protecting and hiding him since she doesn\u2019t believe he would do such a thing. But, this makes no sense as there is no reason for Shion to believe that he isn\u2019t a murderer as she knows nothing about him! To her, he is just a fellow classmate, and the only interaction that she has ever had with him was one case where she asked for Hiro to go out with her, confessing her feelings in the process, whereupon he said, \u201cThanks\u201d and walked away. There is nothing to suggest otherwise that he is not the killer, and it always annoyed me how na\u00efve she was in letting, essentially what is a stranger, inside her home! Her character, as well as that of her Grandma,  are used mainly as a means for Hiro to learn to love people once again, and giving him some kind of reason and drive to fight to protect them, but it\u2019s handled poorly.\\n\\n\r\nBut, compared to the entire Japanese police force, Shion is a goddamn mensa student. The police force, for whatever reason, are incapable of tracking down one single person, and it\u2019s not like Hiro stays inside Shion\u2019s place all the time either. He comes and goes rather frequently, and, in one instance, leaves just to murder some reporters before flying back! With all this travelling, and considering that he is one of the most wanted men in the area, why did it take so long for the police to hunt him down? Even more so when there are hundreds of goddam surveillance cameras all over the place too; surely, they must have been able to catch him on camera or something? Additionally, when Hiro begins his crusade to murder every person in Japan, he takes to the buildings and kills 100 people there and then, before issuing a warning to the rest of Japan that the following day he will kill 1,000. However, despite this massive threat, and proving that he has the means to be able to pull it off, nobody seems to even care! The very next day, despite commenting that there are fewer people out, most people are still working and walking about the area where all those people were murdered, but above all, most people are still using their phones! It was established in the previous attack that Hiro can kill you through a smartphone, or any other device with a screen on it, and here we have idiots walking around with their phones still! Do they actually want to die?! Also, why are the police not doing anything to find Hiro? Like, clearly, he was snipping people with his finger banging from high up on buildings, but where are the helicopter surveilling each building to try and find this guy? Even more so when we learn that he doesn\u2019t even move from his location and just spent the night sleeping on top of the same roof he killed everyone from the day before! What are the police even doing?! One final thing I want to rant about really quick is how each woman in the show, most particularly teenage girls, refer to Hiro as being \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d so much so that there have been several fan groups made about him, and when one girl, during the massacre of 100 people sees Hiro appear on her phone, she blushes and acts like a dumbass instead of being fearful for her life! Why is Hiro being idolised? This is the guy who murdered babies for crying out loud! While the show does too seem to question this, as evident by a couple of police officers who are discussing this fact, this element always bugged me, and I groaned to myself whenever a girl would comment about how \u201chot\u201d Hiro was.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Flying Grandpa Simulator suffers from poor production values too, and while most of the character designs are fine by themselves, in motion, when the use of CGI is used, it can look pretty choppy. The CGI contrasts awkwardly with that of the traditional 2D animation, intermixing both within the same scene haphazardly, sometimes utilising CGI just for walking animation, and it\u2019s incredibly inconsistent to bat. At best, it wasn\u2019t too bad, and the CGI wasn\u2019t obtrusive enough to really pull me out of the show, but at its worst, the CGI models can look hideous! Inuyashiki is far from the worst looking thing I have ever seen, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly good either. As for most of the music in the show, it\u2019s rather forgettable, barring one slapstick piece, that I remember above everything else since it was used bizarrely in a scene that didn\u2019t fit the tone of the piece; a scene in which Inuyashiki has to stop several planes from crashing into the city to prevent hundreds of deaths! It feels pretty jarring and doesn\u2019t work at all. The OP and ED tracks, however, are both excellent! The OP is perhaps one of my favourite opening tracks for any anime, and I\u2019ve listened to it on repeat while writing this review for hours now, I can\u2019t get enough of it. It hypes me up so much, and is so goddamn catchy that I love it! By contrast, the show\u2019s ED takes on a much more sombre and melancholic tone, reflecting the attempted relationship between that of Hiro and Shion, and is also a wonderful piece of music in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Inuyashiki is a bad show; one that is bogged down with poor writing, idiotic characters and mediocre production values, but I loved every second of it! It\u2019s pure dumb shlock on every level, with a premise that I enjoyed due to just how silly it was. But, at the same time, this makes Inuyashiki hard to recommend to people since, as I said before, your level of enjoyment with this show is dependant on whether you enjoy shlock, and if this premise is one that you may enjoy as a \u201cso bad that it\u2019s good title\u201d. As it stands, however, I can\u2019t bring myself to hate this show, despite how poor it actually is, since it brought me nothing but enjoyment, and while I am disappointed on some level with this show, as I\u2019ve heard amazing things about the original source material, this show is certainly a better one than MAPPA\u2019s previous effort, Bukkakegurui, a show that not only was bad but also boring! Inuyashiki, in my opinion, is the good type of bad show. The type, that despite still being indeed bad, is still able to make an entertaining show despite that. With all that said and done, and finally ending my longest review yet, I thank you for taking the time to read this and, who knows\u2026 maybe your grandpa is also a cyborg too!",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nIntroduction:\r\nInuyashiki..... It is the name of the anime I am going to have a review on. Coincidentally, the word \"Inuyashiki\" comes from the main character's full name. The anime Inuyashiki revolves around two men. One is an old man while the other is a young, teen-age high-schooler. You know on most anime the grown-up is always the antagonist of the series and the young ones are the protagonist, gaining character development every episode. Here, the old one is the protagonist and the young is the antagonist on most audiences. I said \"most\" there. Why? The story offers us what are the circumstances of theaged and the youth. The aged worry about family and health while the other worry about his colleagues. Throughout 11 episodes we have seen  the huge differences between the two. Base on the author of Gantz, Inuyashiki is an anime with the dark element shadowing its story. Does being a total human are the only ones have the right to help someone? Is having a human brain and a heart.. really consider someone being human?\\n\r\nDoes being different to everyone really makes u different? Those are the common questions I've come across while watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of Inuyashiki focuses on the two main characters of the series. I, indeed, to be honest, have a hard time understanding both of them especially the antagonist Shishigami Hiro. With both of them having different ideals crashing like two planets together, it's really hard to get in favor to one of them. The story of Ichirou Inuyashiki is however, simple. He got cancer in an old age. His children doesn't care to him that much anymore unlike when they were kids. And his body is getting weak due to his illness, thus, limiting his work. Then there's Shishigami Hiro. There is no clear explaination on the background of Shishigami Hiro since when he appeared, he immediately showed his powers and how he used it (Like that part when he manipulate the cars to make traffic accident), though one thing is clear to this character. He only have his mother on his side without the father being completely supporting them. I said \"completely\" because yes the father supports them with money, but moral/emotional things? No. This left Hiro with only his mother on his side, devoting to protect her. Also the event (episode 2) of introduction of his friend Ando Naoyuki gave us a clue what's Hiro's personality. Due to his friend's absence because of bullies, Hiro did something. That \"something\" is unpredictable since we are like introduced to it on the spot of the episode where Hiro appeared very first.\\n\r\nThis gave me a conclusion that throughout the story, there will be killings because of Hiro. Killings to protect while Ichirou Inuyashiki is going to stop him on some point in time. Each episode highlights what they are doing while the other is doing something also. This type of segment is a good highlight to the show since the two of them are the main focus of the audience. First 4 episodes (except episode 2) highlighted Ichirou Inuyashiki's perserverance and will to save people even against gangs. Though most of the episodes, reports have sited the \"miracle healer\" which was Inuyashiki himself. Episodes 5 - 11 (9,10,11 for Inuyashiki) gave us Hiro's triggered response. Triggered as in an incident gave way to his mass killings thus, awakening Inuyashiki also to stop him. The final episode (the ending) is quite a good closure to the story as Hiro did something remarkable for the fate of the entire human race (as well as Ichirou Inuyashiki.) and with the ending song on sync with the final moment, you can sense how emotional it was. The story is quite simple and understandable in a viewer's eyes. This what make Inuyashiki a great anime to watch this Fall 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI've already explained that much to understand about the main characters of the story in the \"story\" part. Thus, I will make a short reflection about the other characters. The supporting characters of the story is a strong element here, which gives way to a simple but good story on my perspective. Supporting characters on Hiro's side gave way to an accepting reason or light to Hiro to kill. While the supporting characters on Ichirou Inuyashiki side gives him an influence to save people. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of CG but Inuyashiki done it perfectly for me. It is indeed watchable and damn the metal parts of the body is quite detailed (as well as the asteroid in the final part) and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe songs of the anime gave us a clue of how the starting of an episode and a bit of emotional craze of it. The opening by Man With a Mission is very powerful, along with its visuals, giving us a good headstart on every episode.\\n\r\nThe ending is quite sad or emotional on my perspective as we saw characters not on their full form but in white lights. I dont know the meaning of this (or its just a part of the plan) but at least I can give it a thought that\\n\r\nthe ending shows us the value of each characters to other characters (my own opinion only).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall thoughts:\\n\r\nIt's really obvious that if you go through my review is that I enjoyed this anime in a great way. With its story along with characters on sync, its safe to say that this anime is worth to watch. Overall, I recommend you to watch it. An anime about two characters having different ideals crashing to each other. Then at the end, it all comes down to the human emotion.",

            "content": "> \u201cAre my father and little brother dead too?\u201d\r\n> \u201cWhat does that matter? We were talking about One Piece.\u201d\r\nI want to take you back to 2004, where an anime called Gantz was released; a gritty, gruesome action show from arguably the most inconsistent anime production studio: Gonzo, and it was a fucking train wreck! The finest example of a poor plot turned bombastic; gore, sex, nudity, profanity, it\u2019s all here and is so nonsensical yet outrageous to the extreme, it can only be compared to shitty OVAs of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s that had next-to-no restrictions on what they could do. Unfortunately, due to factorslike fluctuating quality in animation, marketing and just being a downright insane show, other anime such as Monster, Paranoia Agent, SAC: 2nd GIG and Elfen Lied found large fanbases and have been fondly remembered whereas Gantz has been somewhat lost in the shuffle over the years. And those who have seen the show, while there might not be much to say about it positively, can certainly agree that Gantz was one of the most enjoyable pieces of schlock they have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long 13 years.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is this decade\u2019s Gantz, albeit toned down in sheer crudity yet never eases on being an insane power fantasy romp. It is a sci-fi action series based on the manga of the same name from mangaka Hiroya Oku, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, he\u2019s the same guy behind the manga for Gantz. Coincidence? The story tells of Ichiro Inuyashiki, a middle-aged man that appears almost twice his age who\u2019s down on his luck, being ignored by his own family and finding out he has stomach cancer. Just when all looks bleak, he is killed by a UFO before being rebuilt as an invincible superweapon capable of saving lives and destroying the world. That\u2019s right, aliens pop out of nowhere to turn man into machine with the purpose left in question. But he was not the only person rebuilt as such, and while Ichiro sees this as a way to do more good in his life, Hiro Shishigami is an edgy teen that does what he pleases with his new power, most of which involves slaughtering as many people as he wishes. The plot may seem complex but it\u2019s really just an eccentric take on the \u201cGood v Evil\u201d dynamic commonly used. The premise overall is very intriguing, but what matters more is the execution; how well-handled the show was, and this is where my problems with Inuyashiki begin.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on the two main characters, showcasing how they each come to terms with their newly acquired power in their own daily lives, whilst highlighting the contrast in their beliefs and newfound purpose. This contrast is not hard to pick up on, with Ichiro wishing to help those in need and use his power for noble and virtuous reasons, and Hiro\u2026. Well Hiro\u2019s reasons are never really explored \u2013 we only see Hiro abuse his abilities how he damn well pleases because he can. Hiro comes off as a child with this mentality, except even a child would have a more distinct personality than what we have here; a mindless psychopath devoid of human emotion \u2013 an android in both anatomy and mentality. Unfortunately, there are no flashbacks or scenes of Hiro\u2019s past to show what he was like before the night he was killed, and that provokes one to question if Hiro is simply the character meant to be the villain and nothing more. Compare his situation to Ichiro, an old man that has his problems in life made evident, and when he gains insurmountable power he retains how he thinks and feels about others. Ichiro is no perfect character either; empathy for the man is difficult when personal issues are crammed into the first episode before being practically erased afterward, along with minimal time and focus on the relationship with his family, but at least I can say that Inuyashiki is a proper character that comes across like a real person. Whereas Hiro ends up feeling like the antagonist out of necessity for the plot to move forward, whilst allowing for a small group of fans to self-insert as the suave-looking overpowered badass with the world at his feet.\\n\\n\r\nThe points above may seem small when looking at the overall picture, but these minor issues become heavy burdens on the story of Inuyashiki when you look at the structure of the series. The first episode is all about Ichiro and crams a lot of content aimed to put sympathy on his character. At first it seemed an odd choice by staff, but looking back it\u2019s easy to see why considering how most of the following episodes focus on Hiro and how he causes mayhem. It\u2019s hard to not see so much of this cool, calm and crazy teenager murder so many people with Wind Style: Air Bullets and not think that the show only cared about the amount of bloodshed they could animate across the show\u2019s runtime. Initially Hiro also uses his strength for his one friend Andou to stop him from getting bullied, but even when he distances himself from Hiro it does not change Hiro in the slightest. The way the show tries to intertwine both Ichiro\u2019s and Hiro\u2019s separate arcs fails to get viewers to empathise for either main character with one only shown to be on his own one-man rampage from the start, and the other having his arc glossed over as he is thrown into having to be the one to stop the rampage. With the exception of a few times, Ichiro is chasing around Hiro when committing evil acts, stagnating much chance of his character development taking place and putting all the attention on the slaughter. This would not be as big of a problem if Hiro\u2019s character wasn\u2019t built on unexplained motives, coming off so bland and lifeless to the core that both men end up being as one dimensional as the show. The ambiguity was what peaked my interest, but that turned into disdain when you figure out many aspects of the story stays in ambiguity.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst parts of Inuyashiki come when they try to take moments of pure schlock seriously and attempt to have viewers empathise with the people in the show. First off, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to feel for a character like Ichiro when parts of his life are brought up at whatever time is convenient for the show. You can\u2019t expect to exploit a character arc so sporadically and have viewers still feel so strongly for him when they themselves are trying to wrap their head around what is even happening with the story. And Hiro, while having more time and attention put on him, is even more laughable to feel bad for when all he does is murder in the most apathetic ways conceivable, from shooting at pedestrians on a whim to asking a girl what manga she likes after killing their family beforehand and her soon after. He is a psychopathic murderer with the most interesting part about him being that he\u2019s a psychopathic murderer. Real sad. As for one-off characters, their screen time is more of a result of poor pacing than anything else, and it\u2019s hard to feel sympathy for what is happening to random people in the show when the show itself is primarily concerned with being a bloody gore fest. Now a show like that is not inherently bad, but it needs to be self-aware enough to not rely on viewers feeling sympathetic for brutal acts on random bystanders, otherwise you come off as shallow. The pacing is also a constant issue \u2013 the ratio of chapters to episodes is 85:11, meaning that the show is going to be fast as fuck at potentially skipping key events present in the manga to compensate for the amount to content. This only adds to the already apparent problems in the narrative and characters, giving a show with so much violence almost no breathing room, its audience practically being bombarded with carnage being succeeded with more carnage, only separated by Ichiro attempting to save the day and a god-awful romance subplot that makes no sense even for blind teenage love. The ending also suffers from the pacing, being incredibly rushed that even with how clich\u00e9 and contrived it was, any emotional impact it had on viewers had the weight of a slight breeze. Inuyashiki was never intended to be an emotional story and here it should have never become one.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious that Inuyashiki is more concerned with being about senseless fun than a battle of morals between good vs evil represented by two men not even human anymore, but for a show about being entertaining at such a base level, it was a boatload of fun to watch. The ridiculous of it all works to its favour, getting away with some the most shocking yet hilarious moments I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Seeing CGI-animated men fly through the sky at night alone is funny enough, but having a man-child act as if he were holding on to an imaginary assault rifle, before massacring everyone in sight while saying \u201cDADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA\u201d takes the hilarity to a whole new level. Events such as shooting people through their mobile phones, fighting an entire crime syndicate with technique from World Star Hip-Hop and learning to fly from channelling\u2026 Astro Boy?? How one cannot laugh out loud when watching this amazes me. Even when the main lead\u2019s cybernetic enhancements are never looked into over the 11-episode duration, I can\u2019t even be mad at this point. This is schlock to the max and is only concerned about being schlock with no thin veil of depth hiding its true intentions. If years later if I forget the show or the characters, at least I\u2019ll remember the moments that made Inuyashiki what it really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation can be hit-or-miss depending on how you feel on CGI, and while I do think that CGI can be utilized well in anime, it feels out of place for the most part here. Initially this style is used only to show how complex Ichiro and Hiro are when they transform into the primitive mechanical lifeform, but from there its used more and more to where even basic walking will be computer-generated at some point. It becomes incredibly jarring when the show switches from the traditional 2D art style to 3D animation, and can also just look downright hideous, comparable to graphics from a PS1 era game. While it does makes everything look stupid and ergo more entertaining on a superficial level, it\u2019s more of a detriment to the show overall. It\u2019s such a shame that this show had this kind of animation quality behind Studio MAPPA, one that is praised for their high production values for anime the likes of Shingeki no Bahamut and even Garo: Vanishing Line, which came out the same time as Inuyashiki and looks much better despite being a lot less popular. Inuyashiki by no means looks like one of the worst anime ever \u2013 that\u2019s asinine to believe, but I expected better. MAPPA, you got to stop letting me down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it has its own share of problems. The soundtrack is forgettable and won\u2019t affect the experience at all. What is top-tier though are the OP and ED; both are awesome. The OP by Man on a Mission features the most metal theme I\u2019ve heard all year and never skipped. Definitely the most hype openings and one of my favourites for sure. The ED however seems somewhat underappreciated, coming off as sombre and melancholic, envisioning the romance between Hiro and his lover and make it a little more bearable than what we were given in the show. All in all, both are great and one will probably appreciate them both more than the actual show. The voice acting here is very awkward, with some casting choices that have left me scratching my head wondering why were they chosen. Hiro\u2019s voice actor is not good but at least I can say he sounds his age. Ichiro\u2019s voice actor makes it as if his geriatric disease was out of control and he was in his early 20\u2019s the entire time. Maybe an English dub will fix this, but as for now I can only judge it by how I heard it and it wasn\u2019t pretty.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Inuyashiki is the kind of anime you\u2019ll enjoy on the surface, since there isn\u2019t anything deeper going on than an edgy teen acting like a supervillain with Ichiro nearly always appearing too late to stop him. It\u2019s definitely an experience that most anime fans won\u2019t have seen before, providing the kind of shocks and thrills that will get you easily hooked to the show. Is it poorly written? Yes. Does it have poor characters? Absolutely. Are the production values bad? Well they certainly aren\u2019t great. But was it fun? OH HELL YEAH! Some of the purest schlock I have had the pleasure to come across, and no matter how many problems I can point out with this show, I cannot bring myself to hate it. One could call it so bad it\u2019s good, but terms such as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d do not do the show justice when it comes to expressing how I felt about Inuyashiki. If you\u2019re looking for an anime that you want to enjoy and is unlike everything you have probably ever come across, this might very well be what you\u2019re looking for.\\n",

            "content": "Most of the current reviews are due to watching few episodes instead of the being up to date so I'd advise reading this review first and/or not being able to handle real world situations that aren't graphic but touch on sensibilities.\r\nThis series has 2 protagonists; it's essentially showing you how a good person vs an evil person would handle becoming a god and what happens when they figure out each others existence. The beginning episodes are meant to highlight their intents and their sense of purpose or malice. It's essentially a take on if god and the devil were both on earth and showing thechaos and miracles that ensue. The characters are written extremely well; you truly get a sense for their personality, morals etc. in the first two episodes. The art and sound are both top tier; but the art isn't on the level of lets say magus bride or houseki no kuni. The sound also has some instances where a simple musical piece would enhance it big time but it's not lacking; just not top end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a seinen show and if you want a 2 dimensional anime instead of something where you actually have to find meaning in, instead of it being shoved in your face. It's both beautiful and brutal so I'd watch the first three episodes and make your decision(you'll get a feel for what to expect and how good will truly be good and evil will be evil and make you feel disgust). From there you should get a pretty good feel for how the plot is going to be told. It will make you feel human watching it; the purpose is to turn you off from violent scenes instead of glorifying them like most generic shows do. If anything it's about how you as a human react and truly asking yourself \"what would I do given these powers\" and truly thinking instead of saying \"x is bad I'd be a hero\" truly think. During the most recent episode just putting yourself in the position of either character; the choices you'd have to make will not just impact you but every one around you and weigh heavily on you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's worth watching 3 episodes if you can handle adult themes; this is an anime that's rated 17+ for a reason so younger viewers shouldn't start it if they can't handle suggestive themes like lets say, graphic violence, sexual themes, drug usage, psychological themes and emotional distress.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; if you can handle big boy topics it's good; if you don't want to be exposed to them don't. This means being able to handle touchy subjects and seeing them from others perspectives.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!!! Review*\r\nTL;DR: No, this is not a Inuyasha remake. It's your typical Japanese Shounen version of \"Breaking Bad\" but with good vs evil mindless sci-fi that makes you question, who would win? Some edgy teenager or some wholesome grandpa! Oh there is also Anime Trump!\r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 5/10, Art: 4/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"So, you're telling me... I'm the villain?\" - Hiro Shishigami\r\nInuyashiki is your classic psychological sci-fi anime, by the visionary mangaka, Hiroya Oku (GANTZ), where the core idea explores the juxtaposition of two ideologies centered around a single question: \"What makes a person \"human\"? Especially when that person used tobe a human but after a slight alteration with Aliens, they are nothing more than a reconstruction of themselves out of spare parts. This anime is a bit twisted at times when looking at humans moral ethics and at times ludicrous with its out of character \"bang bang\" fight sequences. However, it is enjoyable to watch albeit its questionable CGI animations and over the top finger banging skills. Regardless, if you don't mind watching a mindless yet mind-tickling sci-fi action flick, then just watch it. The story in a nutshell is about a shunned Grandpa, Inuyashiki, who dies by alien crash, gets resurrected as a machine with all of his feelings intact and serves justice. Little does he know, the same fate happens to Shishigami but instead of serving justice he commits mass murder. The interesting part of the story is that they both have the exact same power and limitations however one feels humanly emotions from saving people and the other from killing people. This very simple good vs evil setup helps us explore and enjoy the show rather than getting caught up in a convoluted ambiguous melodramatic plot drama. The story is edgy and real to an extent that you can sort of question yourself, \"well, if I don't know them, do their lives really matter to me.\" Regardless, the story is adapted pretty well by Studio MAPPA and has a solid ending. Whether it is good or bad that's for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\n\"He isn't Hiro anymore. He is just a killing machine.\" - Naoyuki Andou\\n\\n\r\nThe fun part about this anime are the characters. They main two characters Inuyashiki and Shishigami are polar opposites of each other. They are juxtaposed so well that each of them become foils for one another. You have the morally ethical eponymous protagonist, Inuyashiki, on one end of the spectrum and then you have the chaotic unethical eponymous antagonist, Shishigami, on the other end of the spectrum. Best part is, they don't really realize if they are the typical \"hero\" or \"villain\" till half-way through the anime. The side characters aren't too well developed other than Andou, who is best friends with both Shishigami and Inuyashiki and acts as the control variable or represent the viewer evaluating the decisions of both. In a way, it just makes this unrealistic sci-fi anime more realistic and grounded to our society. \\n\\n\r\n\"I want you to spend the rest of your lives thinking about the people you\u2019ve hurt and the lives you\u2019ve ruined.\u201d - Ichiro Inuyashiki \\n\\n\r\nAside from the linear plot and polar opposite characters, for a studio like MAPPA, the CGI animation didn't really live up to its expectation as the show progressed from the first few episodes. By the end, the CGI animations in the fight sequences seemed choppy and some frames were noticeably poorly drawn. If they maintained the quality throughout, this show could've been even better. However, the OP Song \"My Hero\" and the ED song \"Ai wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi e\" were really suited for this anime. They are fun to listen to over and over again. The background score was pretty decent. However, since this anime did deals with death a lot, maybe more violin background scores could've enhanced the show. Lastly, the seiyuus did a great job. They made every character feel important. The seiyuu for Inuyashiki was spot on. Kudos to him. \\n\\n\r\n\"Anyway, did you hear? There are already 10 fan clubs for Shishigami\" - A mindless chick from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Inuyashiki is your typical mind-tickling sci-fi anime about two people with the same power but different goals; where one feels alive when saving lives and the other feels alive by taking lives. Sure it deals with some moral ethical dilemmas however it's a show meant to not be taken itself too seriously. If you prefer serious psychological shows, then Parasyte is what you are looking for. Nevertheless, If you don't mind mishandled CGI animation and want a good laugh by watching a kickass Grandpa, then definitely give this show a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Bang! \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "The leaves have fallen, the windy days and chilly mornings have appeared; it's the start of the best season of the year. With my favourite's month arrival, we got quite a pack of new anime to digest with a wide range of emotions. Different studios have yet again filled our ever-hungry stomachs with their representatives, ranging from action-centred goodies to cute girls and finishing on edge fiesta blobs. There was Wit's newborn hot show, which has completely stolen the spotlight as the most popular non-sequel, Pierrot's abomination, J.C.Staff's new food porn and more, yet even though I had so many pieces of work to pickfrom, there was only that one show which instantly grabbed my attention and didn't let me go from it... it was Inuyashiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime takes place in modern age Japan, where our main character Inuyashiki Ichirou lives his unlucky life. His family neglects him and by the end of the day, a doctor diagnosed him with stomach cancer. In anger and sadness, he ran to what appears to be a public park to lament his cursed life. A blinding light came out of nowhere and Ichirou wakes up in the morning, only to discover he's been made into a robot. Sounds somewhat neat right? I mean, how often do we get to encounter a protagonist who's a 58-year-old man given a chance to save people's lives with the use of an unknown power? Yet, at first, I had mixed feelings about the show, mainly due to the massive number of times of discussions regarding its source material's quality. The fact that MAPPA, a studio which has already demonstrated me that I shouldn't trust it when it comes down to interesting premises, was behind it didn't help to remove that precariousness by a single bit. And as it turned out, my inner worries were right.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Inuyashiki is as irritating and wacky as one can get! Yes, we did have some fantastic moments here and there; the second and third episodes were shining like diamonds on a dark and cloudy sky, but the rest of it felt like an utter joke. Take for instance the 4th episode: an ordinary and innocent family was introduced to us in order to let the cliched and evil highly ranked member of a crime syndicate ruin their day. But don't you worry, Inuyashiki is here to save the day! It wouldn't normally bother me; I'm watching an anime with a hero with it, moments like that are unavoidable, heck, they're part of hero's life and at one point or another, we would get a situation like this. Sadly enough, this show is constantly using this scheme: Establish a character, less or more deeply and throw him or her into a situation where Inuyashiki is the only hope for them. The already brought up 4th episode might have the most eye-catching example of this, yet there are more instances of it. In the episode 7th, a businesswoman was brought up to our screens to be cured of cancer (Ok, Hiro did it, but it still doesn't change anything.) and in the 9th episode we were shown a completely unimportant background character in a plane, and guess what happened to that plane? It safely landed on the beach, because of the grandpa's aid. Definitely, the worst of them all, is the case of Mari. She started getting a lot more screen time before, we knew more and more about her and her past for what purpose? To be magically saved by her dad in the 10th episode (even though she should be dead by the time of his arrival). Yes, that was the entire point of her character, just like the rest, she wasn't in any way needed in the story, she hasn't done anything to the plot, even with the superior amount of development she received in comparison to others, which is a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nThis series pacing is... special? I could make a gigantic list of times where we saw something happening on the screen, blinked, and magically we were in a completely different place, time and fucking episode. Again, look at the 4th episode since it's just a damn pot full of examples to use. The old man walked into the room with the girl induced with drugs from the \"baddie\", she was laying and screaming on the bed and a second later she's standing in front of Robo Grandpa. I didn't know that this anime had the Flash in it, damn.\\n\\n\r\nThe robotic bodies our main characters got, is the part where Inuyashiki's writing shows how absurd it can get. I understand it. It's an alien war machine, so when Hiro told us that he can tap into all the Internet messaging, police radios, security cameras from around the world, it was rather believable. Heck, even the sentence about sending an American nuclear missile to China without breaking a sweat, was convincing. We saw it's fighting capabilities, weaponry, durability, the autopilot mode, so what's wrong with it? Even though I know all of these pieces of information, I still cannot get around the fact that this show fed us with so many damn plot devices! \\n\r\nOne of which is Hiro's hand handgun (a pun intended), his most signature weapon. Can someone actually explain how does it work? It functions like a \"normal\" pistol, it's barrel is its owner's index finger, right? So, why in the world does saying the onomatopoeia of a machine gun's gun-shot make it shoot like one? It doesn't make any damn sense, but do you know what's even worse? Holding an invisible rifle in your hands and being able to fire it! What the actual hell is it? What's next? An ability to cure diseases? Oh... nevermind.\\n\r\nAnother example would be a USB port underneath Ichirou's fingernail. Why would there be one in a piece of machinery from outer space? I don't think that a race with far advanced technology would go on and use one of these. \\n\r\nBut the ultimate plot device, which made 0 fucking sense, was the ability to transport your projectile/bullet-ish something through your phone's screen right to some guy's mobile device's screen and kill him. How does it work? How does it make any sort of sense to people behind this show? Does it make sense to you? I have spent a good portion of time trying to figure out, how out of mind someone had to be in order to come up with a tumour-inducing idea like this and honestly I still don't know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, let's just say it here; all of them are one-dimensional beyond belief. Because of that, there weren't many figures who I could describe in more than one sentence, besides our main duo for obvious reasons.  Either they were thrown in to serve as a damsel in distress or they would just fill up the background with their presence, and to say it nicely, most of them were bloody morons. We had some random bad kids trying to kill a homeless person with their fireworks for absolutely no reason and some hooligans who wanted to beat the heck out of a random guy for pointing them out that there was a line to the taxi.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's just start with Hiro and, oh boy, what a mess he is. Our main antagonist was, at first presented as a handsome and popular teenager who was killing people to make himself feel alive. However, as the story has continued, it looked like the creator didn't know what he wanted Hiro to be, a psychopath? TV reporters have said that he was killing animals as a child, which literally implies his psychopathic personality, his actions and the sentences he said over the course of the show are the same, so what's the problem? His \"personality\" shifts like a damn wave, from a cold-hearted killing machine to a guy who apparently cares for someone who was stupid enough to bring him home and vice-versa. Every single time Hiro wants to show emotions; they come off as fake, which would make sense in a case of a psychopath. Yet, it feels like they were trying to make our villain look more complex and more humane, but the result they get is an unbelievably unrealistic and plainly fake character. The whole idea of making the most basic embodiment of evil be something else just tripped over its own ambition.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki, on the other hand, isn't that haywire. Even though at times, he was irrelevant to the story he's the centre of, which was a very interesting thing to see. I'm still enormously happy to see that at least as the generic personification of good, he was a pretty okayish mixture of a likeableness and relatability and quite frankly, the reason why I enjoyed plenty of scenes more than I would have. His character actually grew as the show has progressed, which is an achievement in itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe Inuyashiki's animation, the first thing that would come to my mind would be: overly ambiguous and inconsistency. Why do I assume so? Throughout the series, there are many instances of that unfulfilled desire and deviation of quality. They occurred mainly due to the abundance of CGI scenes done so poorly or in even worse cases, the said inconsistency in 2D animation. I almost thought the animators were having a drunk party while they were completing their job when there were scenes with CGI and 2D blended together in the most repulsive way imaginable. The quality of what we were seeing on the screen would jump out of boundaries in order to screw itself up, which at times was both hilarious and plainly depressing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Inuyashiki is in all honesty, is the most valuable part of it. While it does have an equitable share of rather questionable sound effects here and there, I can't stress enough how much I adore these small insert songs and the opening itself. They fulfil their purpose on an actual decent level, getting you in the mood to watch some action. It does create an unsettling feeling inside your body... you just can feel the hype, which doesn't happen all that often. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Inuyashiki? Both yes and no. The number of times when I was scratching my damn head because of the stupidity happening on the screen was huge, yet I couldn't find myself truly disliking it. This series just oozes with an extremely eerie sensation: you know that it's schlock, but at the same time you are enjoying it even in the smallest degree. The sole fact that I've rewatched it says a lot since I haven't done it before. \"Turn off your brain\", a sentence I hate with a burning passion, yet in this case, actually fits perfectly.\\n\r\nI mean, when I was drunk as hell, this series was a top-notch fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Inuyashiki is like a sinewave stuck on its bottom. Inconsistent, rushed and jumbled schlock with so many problems, I could probably cover up the surface of our planet with them. Horrible pacing and characters with either no purpose, development or any logic behind them, which in itself is pretty absent in this PlotDeviceGenerator 9000, are the most noticeable ones.  A \"fast food like\" show, while somewhat enjoyable, would have been a lot better if given enough care and attention to details. A gore fiesta which will, quite literally, make you question whether MAPPA is doing terrible shows on purpose or not. \\n\\n\r\n(As an added bonus, I've counted how many times it has been said that a certain character has or had cancer and guess what? Damn 5.)",

            "content": "Ah, Inuyashiki, a series that had the potential to be a hit, turned into a forgettable experience. I really tried to like this anime but seems like MAPPA didn't want me to. You see, Inuyashiki is an anime full of plot conveniences, asspulls and bullshit. Why? I have several reasons why, as the same way people would have their reasons to say this anime is good, so let's get started. There might be spoilers on this review, so be warned\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nThere is absolutely no story on this anime, nothing meaningful actually happens, there is the concept of \"Good and Evil\" but there isn't anythingworth to be called a \"story\". The anime itself lacks direction, first you get that some aliens crashed and \"accidentally\" killed both the Main Character and the \"Antagonist\", then the same aliens reconstruct them into some sort of automatons. That's it. An \"accident\", there goes the whole argument of the series, the Aliens topic is never touched again, they don't even return to get their weapons back (I mean, they could have returned with some robot pieces that aren't weapons). Let's be aware that this \"accident\" gave powerful weapons to 2 random people and also made them immortal, because why not. Its like activating \"God mode\" cheat on a sandbox game like GTA to create a low tier Michael Bay film. There you have it, Senseless gore fest with no purpose at all. It can be entertaining for a while, but it becomes old pretty fast. Same thing happened to Re:Creators with Altair, it becomes boring with some time and you are just expecting shit to be done for good but it doesn't and it drags a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace on this anime is atrocious, the \"Antagonist\" changes from being a psychopath to a caretaker and back to a psychopath so freaking fast that makes it look like a joke, specially when the anime tries to make you feel bad for the \"Antagonist\". Having such an atrocious pace just backfires, there are better ways to portray a psychopath villain but Inuyashiki fails at it, Its pretty hard to develop good characters in 11 episodes, specially when the pace is as inconsistent as Hiro's behaviour. This anime also likes to add a lot of irrelevant characters to either show how retards they are or just for the sake of plot conveniences.\\n\\n\r\nThe Amount of bullshit that is thrown at your face is ridiculous, people on this anime acts like a bunch of idiots. There were several times where I could hit myself with a brick because of the stupidity of the entire population of Japan (and also the antagonist). Another thing that I found as bullshit is the way how these \"alien weapons\" works, At first it was a bit believable to think that Hiro's \"Handgun\" were an Air compressed weapon, But this is thrown away and it easily becomes an asspull, because somehow with this \"Handgun\" you can kill someone through a screen (Or either form a rifle with your bare hands and make it work like it is real) How convenient. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on this anime is fairly decent for most of time... That's it, until we get thrown with 3D CGI scenes that pretty much lacks (and sometimes it is quite unnecessary) It looks stiff and poorly made. Even Vanishing Line has better animation than this and it doesn't entirely depends on CG to make good fighting scenes (Take in consideration that Vanishing Line is also being made by MAPPA) 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the voice acting... Some people said that the voice actors are actually Live Action actors and that their role is to sound \"real\", but \"real\" isn't something I can think of when hearing their voices, it isn't entirely bad, but not that good either. The soundtrack of this anime comes in the pack of terrible writing, direction and pace, it doesn't work as intended so of course it won't hit. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI already stated before (and several times on forums) my dislike with the characters. To make it quick, Old Man Inuyashiki is WAY TOO MUCH for this anime, the entire population is way too stupid to even deserve what Inuyashiki did for them. Other than that, The characters on this anime also comes in the pack of terrible writing, pace and direction. Character development lacks when there isn't a significant concept and plot to follow. The way things happens is way to abrupt and very fast paced that the character development is trashed away easily. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd still, after all that clusterfuck of shit happening, this anime were still entertaining. It will satisfy those that doesn't care that much about these details or those that wants some senseless action. But if you can't let certain details aside, I'd recommend you to skip this anime and watch something else. 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 (3,6): The terrible direction, pace, and writing killed an anime that could have been a hit. Significant plot is missing, characters executed poorly, plot conveniences, asspulls and a lot of bullshit.\\n",

            "content": "This is a preliminary review.\r\nLong story short.... this is based on manga made by the same person who wrote Gantz. And the author of the original has a problem - he is unable to properly portray normal people + has a huge fascination with bullying scenes and display of power being used to abuse someone in the worst way possible.\r\nBasically, there are two types of characters in many scenes - some menacing threatening all powerful villain (for current scene, anyway) with smug expression on their face, and then some person in the process of being abused - usually in a state of teary mess -with tears, runny nose, sweats, etc, looking all pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this stuff isn't really fun. Because when some sort of confrontation happens between characters in the series, they ALWAYS jump into those two stereotypes, meaning there are a lot of scenes that are pretty much abuse/torture porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe next problem is that when abuse scene starts, the author doesn't really know where to draw the line. Meaning if there's a rape or murder involved it can happen onscreen. This is basically, lack of taste and inability to discern when an on-screen scene is necessary or if it is possible to shock the viewer with implications of something that happened off-screen and fridge logic (which can be more horrific). This problem of the author resulted in extremely poorly done episode #2, which is cringe-worthy and bad overall.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on some rare occasions where the author finally sees the light in the end of the tunnel and snaps out of his bad habits, there are occasional nice moment. First episode has several good examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, the anime greatly suffers from poor writing, and poorly written characters. Inuyashiki himself, for example, most believable when he doesn't say anything. As long as he start speaking up, he doesn't really give an impression of a real person. \\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the show starts with a somewhat interesting premise in the first episode, and with an unusual main character - an old man. However, it ruins the show in second episode with poorly executed shock content sequence which is pretty much \"torture porn\", is handled rather tastelessly, holds no real value and adds very little to the story. All things considered, it looks like the show will continue throwing \"horrifying\" or \"shocking\" scenes at the viewer one after another. Which is just a poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10.\\n\r\nInteresting first episode, and massive potential behind the primary idea. Poorly written second episode with pointless shock content all over the place which is handled rather tastelessly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nDecent visuals, hand-drawn anime assisted by CG assets, similar to Ajin, Sidonia no Kishi, seikai suru kado, etc. However, visual assets - cg ones - are poorly executed compared to the other shows I mentioned. The computer parts looks clearly CG, meaning they do not blend properly with backgrounds. They are okay, but could've been done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nDoes its job but nothing amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10:\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is sympathetic, and very well portrayed in the first episode. However, main antagonist and people the antagonist interact with are poorly done and are uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nTo be fair, it is something like 6/10 for the first episode, and 2/10 for the second. Due to poor handling of violence and shock content. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\r\nWell, at the moment I think a decent idea would be to watch the first episode and drop the show. Based on two episodes it looks like the idea will be to throw more and more horrifying and shocking scenes at the viewer, and that's just cheap. \\n\\n\r\nSo, so far it is a disappointment and there are better animes out there. I'll probably give it a try for a few more episodes, and if it doesn't improve, I will drop it.",

            "content": "The biggest disappointment of the season is definitely Inuyashiki. I wanted to love it, but in the end, it was held back by far too many unavoidable issues. \r\nThe first episode introduces you to the melancholy life of a dying man, Inuyashiki Ichiro, who is in a loveless marriage with two kids that despise him. The director gets you truly feel sad for him through quiet and somber moments of him alone in his everyday life. \r\nI was impressed with how well the director got me to care about a character I just met, but sadly none of the episodes following it quite lived upto its relatively lofty achievement. \\n\r\nIn episode 2 we\u2019re introduced to the psychotic villain Hiro Shishigami, the most undercooked and confusingly written villain I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat broke the show for me:\\n\r\n1. The ratio of chapters to episodes is 85:11. I have no doubt this is the cause of the show's horrible pacing issues and underdeveloped characters.\\n\r\n2. Killing cute little animals doesn\u2019t make you poignant, it\u2019s just edgy and blatant attempt to make the audience feel sad.\\n\r\n3. Shishigami. A villain with unexplained abilities, unclear motives, and no charisma.\\n\r\n4. The unbelievable stupidity of the citizens of Japan, real people wouldn\u2019t just stand around and let themselves be killed!\\n\r\n5. The tone-deaf social commentary. That 9/11 episode. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be social criticism on America, but it came off as incredibly disrespectful and tasteless. It doesn\u2019t matter how many years it has been, there are some lines that you should not cross.\\n\r\n6. The art quality declines and the CGI look like something out of a PS1 era game. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 3/10]\\n\r\nAt first, the ambiguity of how Inuyashiki and Shishigami got powers drew me into the show. You could interpret it by saying that the aliens wanted to test humanity by giving powers to the best and worst humans. However, the longer I watched it the more I realized that the ambiguity is only there to cover up a lack of any lore and avoid world building. There is nothing deeper at play here. Unless you intend to analyze the sick mind of the show\u2019s twisted author. \\n\r\nYou may not feel it now, but once you get to the end you\u2019ll feel as cynical towards the writer as I do now, it\u2019s just incredibly lazily written. \\n\r\nPoorly explain logic to the cyborg abilities. The pacing is all over the place. When a show as full of violence as Inuyashiki doesn\u2019t give its viewers any room to breathe between the horror, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the director didn\u2019t even care whether or not we had the time to analyze what we were seeing. Is it just meant to be a fun thrill ride of super-powered cyborg destruction? If so, then why is there no charm or charisma to the characters? Why do they all have realistic sounding voices and realistic designs? The answer is that Inuyashiki was intended to be taken seriously. However, unless you\u2019re able to turn off your brain you won't get much out of it. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of the show's issues, the ending is fucking awful. It's so rushed that its \"emotional impact\" hits about as hard as a foam bullet from a nerf gun. I had heard from people that read the manga that the ending was bad so I was prepared. However, nothing could have prepared me for how abhorrently cliche and contrived it was. The entire conflict of the final arc starts and ends in the last few minutes of the final episode. This gave me no time at all for the weight of the situation to sink in. \\n\r\nIt's the kind of ending that is so bad that it hurts the overall quality of the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 4/10]\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a great person, but a woefully undercooked character. The first episode does a great job of getting you into his mindset. He\u2019s a kind caring old man who is for (some unexplained reason) hated by his family and ignored by everyone, then he gets cyborg powers (for some more unexplained reasons) and uses them save lives and be the become the best hero ever. We sure lucked out that the guy who got cool cyborg powers was a compassionate old man\u2026 right? \\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Hiro Shishigami, the other guy who got cyborg powers. He\u2019s Inuyashiki\u2019s foil and the show\u2019s main antagonist. You\u2019ve never seen a poker face until you\u2019ve seen Shishigami, but that\u2019s about all that his character is good for. He murders dozens of innocent people with his powers in long and overdone scenes. We get it! He\u2019s a murderer!! You don\u2019t need ten minutes an episode to remind us.   \\n\r\nInuyashiki is pushed aside to make room for the less interesting Shishigami, which in turn means the majority of scenes in the show are unpleasant and full of tasteless violence. The potential of Inuyashiki\u2019s character is never explored. I was expecting we would see a subversion on the hero\u2019s journey trope, but instead all that came from his character was a contrived and overwrought melodrama. He\u2019s comparable to a popped balloon that sprays out hot air and fart noises for 11 episodes. All pathos, no development. \\n\\n\r\nHiro taking center stage is most likely a result of the writer\u2019s obsession with psychopaths and violently killing innocent people because that is just about all Hiro seems to exist for. His logic for doing what he does becomes more convoluted as the show goes on, he changes his motivations at the drop of a hat, never really giving you a chance to analyze his insanity. \\n\\n\r\nTheir conflicting personalities does add some depth to look into. If the good versus evil allegory isn't completely trite to you. Plenty of other better anime have taken on this theme but if you must suffer through Inuyashiki at least you'll have one thing to motivate you to keep watching. It adds an extra layer to read into and its the only character traits that remain consistent throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 5/10]\\n\r\nUgly CGI. It looks just as janky and unfitting to the show\u2019s 2d art as the CGI skeletons from Dies Irae. Incredibly jarring switches from normal art to CGI that breaks immersion constantly. \\n\r\nIn the first few episodes, the CGI is used frugally and only during action scenes, it is used to capture the complexity of the mechanical cyborg components and their small details. At first, I praised the CGI for being used creatively and only when necessary, but in the later episodes, it is used much more. The worst part of the CGI is how awkward the characters\u2019 faces look. It looks like something from a PS1 era game. Even their designs are a bit bland. I\u2019d I expect the designs to be original enough to pick up a bit of slack because the characters have no charisma and very poorly defined personalities. There are better ways to create realistic characters than generic designs and tame attitudes. \\n\r\nFor Inuyashiki to be airing at the same time as the groundbreaking CGI oriented anime \u201cHouseki no Kuni\u201d, it only makes its issues a hundred times worse. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 6/10]\\n\r\nMetal as hell opening and a very mellow ending. Both sound amazing, the opening is really well animated and it sadly becomes the highlight of the show during the final episodes. Good sound effects, but lacking in a certain punch. Even Houseki no Kuni felt more impactful than this. \\n\r\nRealistic voice acting works for drama, but this is an action-heavy show and some of the ranges required the characters were out of the voice actors capabilities. The yelling in particular sound really awkward. It's commendable that they were going for something unique but it didn't work out in my opinion. Oh yeah, I should mention Shishigami's stupid finger gun. \"BANG BANG! BANG!\" That shit got annoying real quick. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3/10]\\n\r\nIt was around episode four that it hit me, Inuyashiki is an anime that actively tries to make you feel horrible. This anime almost always strives to make you feel just as depressed and hopeless as it's characters. And well, it usually succeeded at its pointless goal of upsetting me. If it weren't of such a low quality I probably would have felt depressed through its entire runtime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really for some reason want to feel disgustingly upset for 4 hours straight, well all I can say is good luck taking this show seriously. Due to the head-shakingly stupid reactions of the people of Japan have to the horrors that Shishigami commits it becomes more like a comedy than a tragedy. \\n\r\nPeople get killed in ways that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a show like Ousama game. There\u2019s no logic to how the cyborgs work, at least not in the show. Shishigami kills people through cameras with his finger gun, Inuyashiki heals people from any ailment. I was hoping to get some enjoyment from trying to figure out the alien story and the cyborg originations or even just analyzing the enigmatic Hiro, but nope. Inuyashiki has done such a great job of making me feel cynical towards it. The combination of shoddy visuals, underdeveloped narrative, unexplored characters, and frustrating action made it a slog to get through. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 4.2/10]\\n\r\nA studio as well known as MAPPA seems so lazy to be cutting corners like this especially when smaller studios are producing work that is miles better. The moral of the story? Go watch Houseki no Kuni if you want to see an actually good example of CGI used in a creative way rather than a crutch to support a lack of budget. \\n",

            "content": "First a brief non spoiler review for those who haven't watched it:\r\nInuyashiki is a seemingly ultra violent, schlocky sci fi - bullshit thingy. And as far as that goes, it's excellent. It has good tension building, very tight pacing, very strong characterization, memorable lines, striking visuals (albeit with sometimes so-so CG), interesting social commentary, a great musical score and one of the most badass opening themes in recent memory. On top of that it's a complete manga adaptation with a solid ending.\r\nIt may have some strange writing in places, the story goes in to some wacky directions and the violence ranges from over the topsilliness to just plain depressing and uncomfortable. But all of it is somehow very entertaining nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of the series full of spoilers.\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the entire thing do NOT read any further. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\n--SPOILERS--\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 opens with a pan out shot of an ant crawling out from underneath a car until the MC steps out of his car, while stepping in front of the ant, blocking its path. The ant then changes direction and keeps walking. This is likely foreshadowing the hit and run the aliens do on our main characters later in the episode while also foreshadowing the ending when the asteroid's about to strike the earth. The parallels between these events are fairly obvious if you think about it - giant thing (man/ spaceship/ asteroid) randomly and without any malicious intent comes close to crushing something more vulnerable (man/ant/earth) only for it to survive after altering its course..  This also establishes the running theme of this series which I will get in to. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the episode focuses on the titular character Inuyashiki Ichiro and his mid life crisis. He buys his family a new house that happened to be right next to a rich mangaka's mansion (this briefly comes in to play later) and his family is ungrateful towards his efforts. If that's not enough, Ichiro is informed that he has cancer and only 3 months to live and his only comfort becomes a stray dog that he finds. About midway through the episode the inciting incident happens when Inuyashiki and Hiro get hit and die by accident from an alien spaceship, and then rebuilt as machines with their emotions and memories still intact (I don't know, just roll with it). Ichiro later discovers his new powers when he saves a homeless man (notice that this man was on the payphone promising to find a job and better himself, it's important) from a bunch of teenage thugs. Ichiro then remarks \"I feel alive\".\\n\\n\r\nThis same line is later repeated by Hiro in the very next episode after murdering an entire family. Clearly painting a good vs evil contrast between the two. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 2 Hiro is introduced as an intelligent teenage boy who's not interested in a social life despite his sharp tongue and good looks. He's asked what he thinks about a hot girl he's shown by his fellow students and his response is how shallow and lacking in personality that girl is and claims that he much prefers a fictional character with an actual personality (in this case, best gir.. er.. I mean Nami from One Piece). \\n\\n\r\nAt least partially, Hiro can be seen as a by-product of society. As a backlash to what the author perceives as a shallow society that judges people based on their looks and not their character (I'll come back to this topic later). \\n\r\nThat's not to say that his actions are shown in a positive light in the slightest. The main purpose of this is to draw a clear line between Hiro and the rest of society. Which is important since he ends up declaring war on that society, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the episode Hiro sits with Andou, a socially awkward friend of his, in his room who's been absent from school due to being bullied and also happens to be a fan of Gantz (the other manga from the same author as this) and they go back and forth a bit on how Andou can possibly be a fan of such a violent manga. Hiro also points out that the manga has been heavily scrutinized by social media like 2chan (they also come in to play later). Referencing Gantz may seem like this is just the author advertising his own work but I think there's a little more to it. On one side you have Andou who's a gentle non violent person who loves a violent and deeply disturbed manga. This might be commentary about how violent fiction doesn't necessarily cause violence in real life. Or maybe he's just defending his own work, it's hard to tell.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand you have Hiro who's a fan of the lighthearted shonen manga, One Piece which I am sure is not a coincidence. The main theme of One Piece is pursuing your dreams and the power of friendship and, not coincidentally, you see Hiro an episode later murdering the boys who are bullying his friend, all for his sake.. Don't get me wrong, I love One Piece and shonen in general but I think the implication is that Hiro has taken the manga's message to an extreme. It's not unheard of for sociopaths to have people they feel content being with, even if it doesn't come from a particular fondness of those people and more so about their own well being. And it's clear he never was a normal person, it is mentioned in passing that he used to kill animals as a child for fun, and the suicide he witnessed at the train station screwed him up further which gave him a sensation and a lust for human blood. It's also the event that likely lead him to contemplate in the park where the aliens crashed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe only person he seems to show genuine affection for is his mother who divorced her husband and presumably worked her ass off to raise him. She even has cancer and weary eyes that make her appear older than she is.. Sound familiar?\\n\r\nLater in the series he also forms a connection with a girl from his school and her grandma. But this connection is mostly one of convenience and doesn't seem all that genuine due to his body language when with them and that he even considered killing them in their sleep.\\n\\n\r\nEvery day happy families also seem to make Hiro feel discontent due to his split up family background even if he's not fully aware of it. This is demonstrated in episode 2 and 3 when he breaks in to random family's houses and murders every family member.  Even in the first family he killed there's a particular emphasis on when he kills the father of the household - the father's body falls on his child while they're in the bathtub drowning him, making it seem almost as if the father himself was the one strangling him. You can see this alluding to Hiro's disdain for (or his general relationship with) his father which we know he's not very fond of.. He seems to visit his father's new family out of obligation and nothing else. Or maybe it's just cruel senseless violence for the sake of it. Sure. But whether you like hearing this or not, children without fathers in the house are more likely to become criminals, drug addicts or screwed up in some way. \\n\\n\r\nSociopaths are also known to be highly intelligent which Hiro demonstrates very well with his sharp, opinionated dialogue and quick learning skills of how to use his new body (and by liking Nami ofc). He learns pretty quickly how to hack any computer he wants and to use all the dangerous weaponry at his disposal. Meanwhile, we see the average salary man, Ichiro struggling to learn how to fly, heal people etc'. Even by the end of the series Hiro is way ahead of him to the point where he already figured out how to self destruct. This also might be commentary on their age difference and how older people are less familiar with modern tech. Which seems to be reinforced when Andou teaches Ichirou how to turn his body in to a cell phone.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do think Hiro is an amoral individual to the core that doesn't mean he's not capable of doing good things too. Him going around curing people from terminal diseases was a good thing in practice, but it was not done out of the goodness of his heart, but for his own benefit in pleasing his girlfriend. Manipulating others and adjusting your persona is all part of being a sociopath. It's also worth mentioning that this short lived change in Hiro's ways is a result of a completely random encounter with this girl, which ties in to both the beginning and ending of this story that are made up of life changing random occurrences.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the above are clues we get about Hiro throughout the series. we never actually get a full backstory or inner monologue because that will evoke sympathy which I'm positive is not the intent of this story. Thus it also stands to reason that this series begins by fleshing out Ichirou's personal life before the alien crash happens, while Hiro doesn't get the same treatment and we only experience his character after the fact\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of Hiro's mentality, in the last stretch of episodes he declares war on the entirety of Japan. Which seems over the top but in this point in the story the police are after him, his mother already committed suicide, his semi girlfriend, her grandma and even his friend Andou don't want anything to do with him anymore. He even stole a bunch of money for them and they refuse to use it out of principal. He's basically making up for his loss by killing people one by one which is clearly his favorite pastime. It's either that or he just runs away and hides somewhere for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason Hiro sacrificed himself in the end seems to be ambiguous. Sure, he said it's for his girlfriend and Andou, but there's evidence that suggests otherwise: \\n\r\nFirst, lets not forget that his body is wrecked, he's crippled for life, just like the gangsters Ichiro confronted early in the series. Second, as stated above he has nothing left to live for. Third, He didn't look Ichiro in the eye when he gave him that reason, despite looking him in the eye in his next line of dialogue - suggesting that he's lying (if you look at the equivalent manga chapter [82] this is even more apparent, I looked it up for this). Fourth, an episode earlier he discovered that he's the villain and Ichiro is the hero in the eyes of the public and he was very upset about it to the point of tears. Ichiro also informs him that saving people is what makes him feel alive. And shortly before he sacrifices himself, Andou tells him that he's not Hiro (a Hero) anymore, just a reckless killing machine, which results in him shedding tears once again ...\\n\r\nConclusion: he didn't mind dying at this point in the story anyway and wanted to be the hero for once, inspired by Ichiro's heroism for the wrong reasons, he did it for his self image and 'feeling alive' one last time. I'm guessing that's the reason for his heroic sounding name.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro on the other hand is the ideal hero we all want, but still relatable and human in his own right. Indiscriminately saving both humans and animals alike. He goes around in hospitals curing people who are terminally ill and he beats up thugs. \\n\r\nFurthermore Ichiro actually had all the trappings of being a villain himself - in the beginning of the series he was 3 months away from death, his family barely talks to him and he looks 20 years older than he really is, which is probably a result of him working to the bone to support his family. There's even a symbolic image in the opening theme that shows him with what appears to be a factory popping out of his body while lying on his back, suggesting that he's working himself in to an early grave (something that's known to happen in Japan). This is just speculation, but I suspect that his overwork might also play a part in his neglected relationship with his family. \\n\r\nAnyway, All of this is a good excuse for him to be angry at the world, and despite that he still remains a good person and sticks to his principles to the end. Hiro's problems are peanuts compared to his but due to their age difference and general attitude towards life, Ichiro is experienced enough to know the consequences of his own actions. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting thing about him is that he's not perfect and his extreme naivety can also lead to some morally questionable actions as well. Like leaving a bunch of gangsters blind and crippled for life when simply killing them would've been more humane. You even see how hesitant he is at first on whether to put himself in danger for others, like any human being would. Hell, in the final battle he even blows up a satellite with the debris falling on the ground unintentionally putting the people below at risk (though to be fair, it's preferable to the risk of Hiro massacring them). That aside, his impact on random people that he saves (who get fleshed out well for minor characters, btw) is implied. The most prominent one is the character arc involving his daughter learning to appreciate him and applying for Shonen Jump which was very sweet. It goes to show that good deeds aren't just good on their own, but they may also inspire others to better themselves. While Hiro's perceived \"good deeds\" lead to nothing but tragedy for himself and others.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro remains the ideal hero we all want and adore and I wouldn't have it any other way. The man helps others without a second thought and doesn't brag or feel the need to be praised for it. After all, the man went out of his way to hide his powers from the public  (because apparently Japanese hospitals don't have security cameras lol). On the other hand, it did cross my mind that he might be doing these things solely to 'feel alive' (because that's what he says) which is the same selfish reason Hiro has for killing people. But it's made clear that he has his heart in the right place and we see that he's genuinely distressed when someone else is in danger, even a stray cat.  And as I've demonstrated with Hiro, this is a series where actions speak louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is heartbreaking that he couldn't stay with his family in the end and that the circumstances forced him to change course - at the end of the day, he wanted his family and the entire earth to keep living because of his good nature. He's the man who shows that not all hope is lost and fills the role of our 'Last Hero'. The fact that even the last thing we see in the final episode consists of his daughter being accepted in shonen jump and his son fighting bullies implies that his sacrifice will have a lasting impact on a larger scale and that society won't stay as shallow and amoral as the author suggests through out the series. I'm sure the homeless man from episode 1 followed through on his promise to better himself too.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up how I view the main characters' I'm gonna say that they're both separate from the author's largely negative view of society. Both of them don't fit in to their surroundings for different reasons and the decision to cast live action actors to voice them seems like an attempt to make them stand out as much as possible.  They're also polar opposites of each other, one has no trace of empathy for others while the other (arguably) has too much empathy. They make up the best and worst of humanity, while the general public are varying degrees in the middle, not sure which side they will end up gravitating towards. That is of course until the end - where it becomes clear that Ichiro won, and not because he won the fight (though that helps too) but because he helped inspire others and made their lives better and even went as far as to inspire a murderous sociopath to do the right thing that only he is capable of doing, even if it's for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aside, now is a good time to expand a bit more on the social commentary. I thought it was clever that most people kept using cellphones even after Hiro was able shoot and kill people through them and they were explicitly warned about it. The way it was portrayed was over the top, sure, but it's clear that the author is well aware of how stupid it is, otherwise he wouldn't call attention to it repeatedly and so blatantly to the point of even having a character say the line: \"I'd rather die than not have a phone\". \\n\r\nObviously this is also commentary on our over reliance on these gadgets. It's funny too since both of the main characters would literally die if not for their mechanical bodies (which also happened to be used as phones occasionally lol).  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I liked how the main character's mechanical bodies weren't explained verbally, instead we're shown how they work visually. \\n\r\nFor example there's apparently an emergency mechanism for when the body is in danger and the user is knocked unconscious (through heavy blows) and a little camera appears at the back of the head and starts shooting lasers everywhere like some kind of home security system. Which is probably why when Ichiro gets shot repeatedly in the back of the head at one point, he's knocked unconscious and the camera doesn't come out.  We also see that water is helpful in oiling it back up. I even liked how clear it was that Ichiro was not a skilled fighter despite the mechanical body. When he fights some thugs at one point he just sloppily swings his fists around like an amature would.. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the commentary: Hiro gaining a fanbase as a mass murderer is due to his looks. Not only is it not unrealistic, sadly, but judging a book by its cover is also a recurring theme in the series. Most notably when Hiro refuses to acknowledge a woman based on her looks in episode 2. Or when people consider Ichiro an elderly when he's only 58 years old (rightfully so in his case) or earlier in the series when he saves a couple that consist of an ugly man and a beautiful woman, while the people surrounding them look at them funny for that very reason. Hell, that same woman later gets kidnapped solely because of her looks. And lastly a female cancer patient crying in the street while kids point at her, calling her \"ugly bitch\". This idea brilliantly came full circle and right back to Hiro who rejected it in the first place. It's consistent with how the general public was depicted through out the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the whole asteroid thing towards the end. This was introduced around episode 8 and at first I thought it was a lazy excuse for a shoehorned climax.. But by the time it ended I realized that it did give the series a high note to end on and it gives the main characters closure that was in tune with their motives and it's also a nice callback to the very beginning. Accidents like Ichiro almost stepping on an ant, forcing it to alter its course. Aliens crashing on earth which resulted in the main characters pursuit of feeling alive again through different means. Hiro changing his ways, briefly, thanks to a random encounter with a girl who confessed to him earlier. And lastly, the asteroid which forced the main characters to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, accidents don't make for good storytelling methods, especially when it comes at the very end of a story.. But accidents are a part of life and I think this is all part of the 'set in the real world' vibe this show is going for. I don't think it's a coincidence that live action actors were hired as part of the voice cast and many real life events, figures and organizations are mentioned throughout the series.  Gantz, the 9/11 look alike and that the president is Donald Trump (and not some random fictional president) and that Ichiro's neighbor is apparently Eichiro Oda and 2chan being a thing, or an ad for 'Man with a Mission's new album (the band that sings the op song) being displayed in the street, Shonen Jump, One Piece,  etc', etc', etc'. \\n\r\nThis is even reflected in the fairly realistic character designs, mechanical designs and background art. And heck, even in small seemingly pointless sequences like seeing the dog randomly trip off the stairs or Hiro realizing that he can't speak in space, only to use his phone 2 seconds later. These are types of things you normally wouldn't see in a fictional story. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this leads me to suspect that the author and the high caliber director, Keiichi Sato knew exactly what they were doing when making this. Life just doesn't always go as planned and we need to change plans accordingly, try to better ourselves to the best of our ability and make the best out of a bad situation. That's what this series seems to be about. \\n\\n\r\nOr maybe it's just a schlocky sci fi title with senseless violence. That works too lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----END OF SPOILERS--\\n\\n\r\nAt face value, I'd say this still is a good vs evil type of story, showcasing both the best and worst of humanity and everything in between. I don't always agree with the social commentary, but it's timely and interesting nonetheless. It also doesn't feel the need to spell everything out, its characters are entirely defined by their actions and surprisingly, its message is a lot more optimistic compared to this author's previous work.",

            "content": "After watching the first three episodes, and seeing how many reviewers summed this anime up as \"torture porn\", I felt the need to contribute a contrasting viewpoint. Now that I have watched 9 episodes, my feelings have not changed.\r\nWhat we are seeing is the complete deconstruction of good versus evil, superhero versus supervillain, protagonist versus antagonist. And the two central characters are an exercise in this. What some reviewers are calling \"torture porn\" is actually the unflinching portrayal of pure evil. It pulls no punches. Is it necessary for the character to do the things he does? No. This is what makes him *truly* evil.He has absolutely everything going for him--from age, to looks, to intelligence, to strong friendship--and still he uses his new-found power this way. Is it necessary for the audience to see him do the things he does? I would argue an emphatic yes. Because we see the direct contrast in the protagonist. He is *pure* goodness. He has every reason to be full of hate and resentment--ungrateful family who mistreats him, advanced aging in his appearance, complete lack of power to change his circumstances--and still he is brought to tears when he discovers he can use his power to help people and *do good*.\\n\\n\r\nIt's powerful. It affects you. It almost brought me to tears in the span of three episodes. That's what great writing can do.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of torture porn out there, and I would agree that it serves no purpose. This show is not one of those cases. It's not for the psychologically squeamish, given the severity of the evil on display; but the villain's arc is no more \"torture porn\" than the hero's arc is \"altruism porn\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd no one has accused it of that yet.",

We are shown ambiguous characters, with no \"good\" nor \"evil\", as they acknowledge their mistakes and learn from them. From a philosophy standpoint, there are intriguing reasons why every action by the main cast is done.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art in Inuyashikiis expressive and shows some characters\u00b4s faces can look good, and still look like a human being, not like the usual trend of drawing people whose faces are are distinguishable only by their hair, eye color and age. The direction is also impeccable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say about this aspect, only that it fits very well. MAN WITH A MISSION\u00b4s \"My Hero\" is a very well made and skillfully put together OP too, that also fits perfectly the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, interesting, and relatable with each one\u00b4s personality being completely different, the incredible stress that is put under the mind of the characters  that undergo the transformations  that occur in the series leads to amazing an amazing character development, really worth of praise.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nInuyashiki\u00b4s story is one of the most unpredictable and genuinely fun to watch  stories that i've watched(in anime) for a long time. It is a joy to look forward to a new episode every week, wondering what surprising events will take place in the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis is an interesting story told masterfully, and I reccomend this to anyone that likes supernatural or sci-fi stories, regardless if you like Anime or not.",

            "content": "After watching this show, I cannot comprehend how people consider it AOTS material. From a pretty hazily laid out narrative that fails to deliver on the themes and questions it presents, to stale characters that are caricatures of what they're supposed to represent, Inuyashiki is a rather forgettable show that relies on shock and gore for dramatic effect as opposed to good storytelling and character development.\r\nArt: I could not stand the jarring transitions from hand-drawn scenes to the weird CGI effects. The hand-drawn frames were actually pretty well done, but half the time the characters are shown in weird blocky CG. What's more, in many'emotional' scenes you have these characters crying while looking like they're made of clay. Some might argue the scenes show the contrast between the machine nature of the characters at hand and the humanity they display. Sure, this was probably the\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are 2-3 main characters in Inuyashiki, with 1 or 2 new focal ones thrown in halfway. All these characters are pretty immutable and stay relatively the same from start to finish. Shishigami is a psychopath from start to finish, with brief glimpses of humanity shining through that ultimately don't really do anything to add to his character; he's made out to be a guy who cares for his family and doesn't care for anyone else, and the show ends with him maintaining this perspective. Same goes for Inuyashiki: caring guy from start to finish. This would be fine, except it's clear the show wanted to pose questions dealing with the nature of humanity vs machine: which would triumph, which is superior, etc. The show only superficially deals with these questions with a pretty banal good vs evil story, afraid to affect its characters and have them actually deal with these questions on a personal level and perhaps change due to it. So in the end, we're left with cardboare cut-outs of the 'evil' guy, the 'good' guy and a pretty boring story of what they perceive 'humanity' to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good psychological thriller, I don't recommend Inuyashiki. There is no depth or interesting delivery of the conflicts present in the show. It is a shallow good vs evil narrative that leaves no sense of closure because there's no other conflicts to be dealt with other than the one of the protagonist vs the antagonist. \\n\\n",

            "content": "A story of the best and worst of humanity...\r\nInuyashiki for LA for the Fall of 2017 was one of LA's most anticipated anime to come out and heck for LA, it delivered!\r\nThere were several things worrying LA for Inuyashiki. One is the entire dynamic of Inuyashiki (the character not the anime) and Shishigami's white and black morality hammering itself in that Inuyashiki is the hope to humanity while Shishigami is the worst of humanity and everything (and by extension more of the minor one-off characters being utter assholes or horrible humans beings) and yes, Inuyashiki goes a bit into this before Inuyashiki and Shishigami havetheir first confrontation. Second is the tone of this anime has mild moodswings bringing in comedic tone to a somewhat serious moment at times and lastly is the CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSo to defend LA's first point is that at least Inuyashiki does delve into the white and black morality and actually goes to show that Inuyashiki and Shishigami aren't completely the extreme's to their respective morality...in some sense. What does LA mean by this?, well the best example is Shishigami, does his hatred for humanity and his literal killer instincts come from his birth?...or did society change him into being this...or was it Shishigami himself?...it's never completely told to us and even with his first encounter with the dregs of humanity. Inuyashiki however only shows that his white morality is tested once Shishigami gets put into the picture. The second point to defend is that Inuyashiki (the anime) at least tries to calm us with several references to GANTZ, Hiroya Oka's other famous work and the author and artist of the original source material to Inuyashiki. Lastly the CGI to defend, it makes sense for LA at least. The CGI are used with Inuyashiki and Shishigami's robotic-ness and yeah that actually makes sense to their alien robotic technology being uncanny thus the CGI is pretty detailed all things given and even the animation isn't completely CGI just when Shishigami or Inuyashiki goes full robot this occurs.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by MAPPA, the animation as LA said earlier, the CGI is implemented very well, but the rest of the animation from the detailed character designs to the brilliantly done battles and uncensored gore and one, risky as hell and LA at least could tell the animation was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, was actually pretty great, from Fumiyo Kohinata voicing the elderly badass Inuyashiki to the stoically tranquil insanity of Nijirou Murakami as Shishigami as well as some great performances from Sumire Uesaka, Kanata Hongo and Sumire Morohoshi as Inuyashiki's (the character) daughter, Naoyuki Ando, Shishigami's \"friend\" and Shion Watanabe who's befriend's Shishigami respectively. The voice acting was great all round and visceral as hell..on speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki gave off LA several feelings to this anime, all very visceral. Now the visceral feelings goes from it's highs to lows, from Shishigami's stoic killing spree bringing terror to LA (no seriously, Shishigami is a terrifying villain if you put him into real life) to Inuyashiki's more bright moments showing us the ray of hope to contrast to Shishigami's.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki's ending might be \"pointless\" or \"anticlimactic\" to some people, however for LA, this was a nice bow to end this hectic plot of good vs. bad and once again shows us that Shishigami as the monster he is...he still has a bit of humanity left in him. LA will say this ending was well done and gave off a nice sendoff to this anime without (and hopefully) not bringing us the annoying \"read the manga\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki was one of LA's most anticipated anime for Fall 2017 and it delivered in all it's visceral and hectic \"showing the best and worst of humanity\" glory it did and easily became one of LA's favourites for Fall 2017. Inuyashiki just didn't fail for LA and even gave LA a VERY nice ending to go off on. \\n\\n\r\nLast Hero indeed...Inuyashiki.",

Protagonist is the good guy and likes saving people. Antagonist is the bad guy and is a psychopath. I didn't realize this was an 11 episode series either. I figured there would be more and then out of nowherethe climatic battle between the two is over in a couple minutes. The battle was lacking as well. They both get knocked out, go into robo combat mode, and the protagonist just wins. We've been building up the assumption that the Antagonist is far more in control of his robotic body but then our MC doesn't have any trouble whatsoever contending and defeating him. Not a scratch on him.\\n\\n\r\nThis is enjoyable if I just turn my brain off. The technical details (up until the last battle anyway) have been pretty spot on.

            "content": "As we enter 2018, an outstanding anime has just ended, typically not your kind of run of the mill, superhero and villain kind of thing, so with no more adieu:\r\nBANG!!!\r\nVery Good 8, Story:\r\nWhat we have here , was your everyday old man nearing retirement and nearing his fate with the grim reaper, to add to his sentiment were his uncaring family who don't give a shit about him, until one night at the park, he stumble upon a young guy and suddenly a flash of light. After which things were never the same again for the two, but the plot here is not what bothwere capable of, but what they have done with their newly discovered abilities, one chooses to abuse his power by killing, stealing and causing mayhem , one chooses to help people instead. Ok so it's such things is always in those superhero shows, but it's the human side that how they see the world should be in their perspective that counts , since here, the evil one sees himself as a villain who is not after world domination but more like doing bad things in a way like a teenager would, which is to use his power as his plaything, in fact all the bad things he does were something like a teenager with some antisocial behavior would do. The good old man on the other hand was more of a responsible one, he sees the need to help since in was in his nature of being selfless a family man despite of the experiences he is having with his family, he is more like turning his frustration into doing something good. and that's is why this ain't no run of the mill. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI were great, there were some fanservices around here were we see a naked girl being abuse by a Yakuza big shot, but nothing malicious, especially when that baddie got what it deserve and don't expect any panty flashes with Mari and Shion. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound: \\n\\n\r\nwell, the voices were appropriate for the character's role I give studio MAPPA for that, I really like that the old man's tone, it was well suited to be this mild manner old man and Hiro's seiyuu who portrays well as an antisocial sinister guy. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo we have an oldman who can pass as Cyborg's grandpa, a teenager who could pass as spoiled kid that needs some spanking from the latter, but the ones making the impact here were not the two but the people whom they encounter, like the oldman beating the shit out of those toughies whom were planning to woop some guy's ass, the family who was mercilessly killed by Hiro, the lusty Yakuza Big Boos who got owned by the oldman, The bullies that were killed by Hiro. And Hiro friend Ando who become's the oldman's sidekick , Mari and Shion were the one who have given this anime it's body so basically it all relies on that. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nFrankly it's the anticipation of Hiro getting owned after his spree of mayhem and murder that was the focal point of my excitement, which it did happen. At first I was disappointed when the oldman did finish him totally, but it was nice that he redeem himself in the end. DADADADADADADADAAAAA!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending may be a bit pathetic, but it was good that studio MAPPA and creator Oku Hiroya didn't hesitate to kill both of them off, since the characters themselves would be better off being missed than fade off, also it was good that the anime only run for just 11 episode, better to have something good for a short time than something long that one would die from boredom. DADADADADADADADADADAAAAA!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas to all of you....\\n\\n\r\nBANG!!!!!!!          \\n\\n",

            "content": "July, 2000. A man named Hiroya Oku revealed to the world with his skills through his infamous sci-fi, horror Gantz. The manga ran over 300 chapters and ended in 2013. It was a time when the man really made a name of himself in the manga community. An anime adaptation aired between April and November 2004. That was over a decade ago. Now, the man has made this new work called Inuyashiki, a title that honestly piqued my interest more than I had expected. However, did it really live up to the hype?\r\nTo be clear, Inuyashiki has nothing to do with Gantz or in factany way similar. However, it\u2019s clear from day one that the author wanted the viewers to experience something memorable. Through his craft, it is accomplished with our two main guys \u2013 titular character Ichiro Inuyashiki and the sociopath Hiro Shishigami. I don\u2019t want to jump the gun here but these two characters are on complete antithesis of each other; like two sides of a coin, ying and yang.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a certain mysterious incident from the first episode, we find out that Ichiro and Hiro develops mysterious powers that could change mankind forever. This show establishes the two characters from the first two episodes through their actions and personality. Ichiro is portrayed as a timid old man who has a hard time making friends. However, it\u2019s shown that he has a heart of gold and works to help others. He puts others besides himself and often takes high risks with calculated chance. On the other hand, there\u2019s Hiro. To put it simply, this guy is a sociopath that walks as a demon in human form. He appears to be kind and respectful but his true personality is much more complex as viewers soon discover. Throughout the show, it\u2019s easy to see that he has a God-like complex of himself. He uses his powers to kill others simply for the thrill and because he can. It\u2019s not entirely known how he developed his personality but a look at his storytelling in relation to his family and school life may have attributed to this. However, Hiro is not entirely devoid of humanity. It\u2019s shown that he deeply cares about his mother and also had a friend named Andou that he occasionally defends from bullies. Later on in the series, Hiro also meets a girl who harbors feelings for him that he grew to accept. That being said, I think Hiro represents the worst of humanity. Through his killings, Hiro confesses that he \u201cnever felt so alive\u201d while he does so. In other words, Hiro kills with little reason besides to feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe creator of the series obviously tries to get viewers to feel something and to be honest, it works. From the first few episodes, it\u2019s intriguing to see the storytelling from both sides. While both Hiro and Ichiro uses violence, they use it for completely different reasons. While Hiro feels alive through killing, Ichiro feels alive through saving others. It\u2019s actually quite relatable too to our today\u2019s society. There are these type of people living in our world. Psychopaths exists and so do heroes. You probably hear about them on the news every day. However, Hiro makes the news for the wrong reasons and it becomes clear that he wants to experiment with his powers and show off his God complex. While this all seems like nonsensational drama, it does actually does work as the show is able to use its violence to full effect. From police massacre to destruction of aircrafts, it gives his insight on what Hiro is truly capable of and how far he goes to prove his point. Additionally, this show also adds a bit of dark humor through the usage of 2chan and other social media drama. My experience from this show made me realize that Hiro and Ichiro really shows what humans are capable of when they are given powers beyond the natural law of order. Ichiro proves that he can use powers to great responsibility to save others and it can be inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter relationships throughout the show can be taken in several ways. Hiro\u2019s relationships can elicit various emotions such as with his mother, Andou, and Shion. They are people he actually cares about although as the story progresses, circumstances begins to change. For Ichiro, I honestly feel sorry for him. The closest friend he has is his dog. He has an ill relationship with his family and even his daughter doesn\u2019t seem to respect him. However, I will say that Ichiro is a man of integrity. Even at age 58, he hopes to make a difference in his world after developing his powers. He accepts them like a God\u2019s blessing rather than using it as a weapon. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say other character relationships in this show is well developed. I can\u2019t really find Shion or Andou memorable at all throughout the series and they hardly influence my enjoyment. On the other hand, the manga itself is well adapted with even references alluding to other manga such as One Piece. I can safely say that the overall tone of the psychology remains impactful. While the show can come off as edgy at times through its violence, it really knows how to use them.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio MAPPA, Inuyashiki\u2019s quality is about as good as it can get. The first few episodes showed that it has the capability of handling CGI. Character designs are also really interesting to take note that shows the frail innocence of Ichiro and deceptive handsomeness of Hiro. The overall setting of Tokyo remains consistent with our modern time. However, what\u2019s really to take notice is the action and violence. To be clear, the violence is over the top especially in later episodes. There\u2019s massive amounts of blood, body parts being blown off, and gunfights. There\u2019s little censorship so expect it to be thrown right to your face. On the other hand, it\u2019s unfortunate to say but I think MAPPA overestimated itself this year. In later episodes, some of the quality suffers such as the flight scenes and pure action movements. \\n\\n\r\nVisually aesthetic and extravagant in style, Inuyashiki\u2019s OP song \u201cMy Hero\u201d by MAN WITH A MISSION is among one of the most memorable of the year. The overall tone and just the imagery itself is filled with creativity and hard to duplicate. However, the voice mannerism of the characters can be a mixed bag. It took me some time to accept Hiro\u2019s voice as his personality became easier to understand. Ichiro\u2019s voice is that of an old man and even harder to accept. The OST is moody although can be emotional at the appropriate times or eerie when impactful events happen.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki turned out to be quite an experience to be honest. From the very first episodes, I was hooked by what it had to offer and the characters were well worth investing into. It didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cgood vs evil\u201d generic story as we explore the depths of human psychology. While I can\u2019t say this anime is recommendable to anyone, it will be one to remember for years to come. A show like Inuyashiki proves that psychological sci-fi fillers are still a draw in the anime world.\\n",

            "content": "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It\u2019s a flying Grandpa!\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s rather counter-intuitive to even mention this, considering how much we actively consume as fans of this medium, but anime is\u2026 strange. It\u2019s a medium in which vigorously seems to try and go against societal norms; a medium not afraid to cover taboo or heavy topics such as incest or depression, and covers such a myriad of different ideas and themes that if someone were looking for something incredibly specific from a piece of media, they\u2019d probably find their incredibly niche want within anime. This is the main reason why I chooseto persist as much as I do within this medium, not only since I enjoy strange pieces of media to begin with, but also because I can get stories and concepts in anime that I can\u2019t get anywhere else, such as Haibane Renmei and The Tatami Galaxy to just name a few. I\u2019m always looking out for something that is incredibly bizarre; something to fill that sensation I have to watch weird media, and the people over at MAPPA gave me what I was indeed looking for in the form of Inuyashiki (aka Flying Grandpa Simulator), a show in which a 58-year-old grandpa becomes a cyborg, with a multitude of different abilities, one of which being flight, as he becomes a vigilante of justice, protecting the weak, and curing people of their disease. Inuyashiki is a strange series and one in which I\u2019m not quite sure where the writers were going with this story. For what I believe was supposed to be a moralistic battle against good and evil while presenting ideas of what it means to be human instead devolves into full-blown dumb shlock, and I loved every second of it! Don\u2019t get me wrong, this show is bad. Quite bad in fact. But Inuyashiki has become one of my favourite guilty pleasures in anime with a concept and aesthetic so silly that I can\u2019t take any of it seriously, even when it\u2019s clear I am supposed to at times. Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki Ichirou, our senior male fantasy empowerment for this tale (laugh track at my totally original and clever joke) is not exactly having the greatest of times. Aside from looking much older than he actually is, his entire family resents him, for seemingly no reason. He has no affection for his wife, as they sleep in different rooms of the house, and his children also give him no time of day at all. To make matters worse, Inuyashiki receives unfortunate news that he has got terminal cancer, and, feeling that he can\u2019t tell anybody about this, keeps it to himself, suffering in silence all the more than before. After a trip to the park to cry alone, suddenly, ALIENS! For no reason, and without any explanation at all, aliens accidentally kill both Inuyashiki and a man standing next to him, our main antagonist for this tale, Hiro (who just so happens to be standing next to him for some reason, but whatever). Realising their mistake, the aliens then rebuild both men, turning them into cyborgs in the process! While Inuyashiki uses his newly found powers for good, Hiro uses it for murder, as the rest of the series sees Hiro running from the police and becoming a bigger threat, with Inuyashiki trying to find him with the help of Andou, the once friend of our villain, who wishes to stop his murderous cyborg pal, leading to Inuyashiki\u2019s and Hiro\u2019s inevitable fight at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFlying Grandpa Simulator is fundamentally a tale of good versus evil, with each character\u2019s respective ideologies being as basic as they come. Inuyashiki is the good guy, Hiro is the bad guy. While they do try and provide some introspection into Hiro\u2019s character and the reason why he kills (which I\u2019ll get into a little bit later in this review) this basic set-up is what allows Inuyashiki to be so damn senseless and fun! Flying Grandpa\u2019s narrative is incredibly silly and over the top, but there was not a single moment in the entire show where I was bored and not laughing my ass off at how ridiculous the show could get at times, with the basic good versus evil narrative providing an amusing framework for all the stupid stuff that happens in the show. This acted as an incentive for me to keep watching, just to see what the writer would think up next, and he never failed to entertain me on that front. The show is constantly trying to one-up itself every step of the way, with the narrative becoming more and more cheesy and ludicrous as it goes along, with Hiro proclaiming that he will kill everyone in Japan and even beginning to see through on this proclamation as he takes to the city buildings, and from there, kills hundreds with his finger banging, being the icing on the schlock-filled cake! The anime is all over the place, and the pacing, in particular, is so fast, that it actually works in favour of the show from an entertainment standpoint. One moment we see Inuyashiki flying through the skies accompanied by silly cartoon slapstick music, and then the very next episode we see him infiltrate a yakuza hideout, blind every single person there, and leave completely shirtless (not to mention that in the start of that very same episode, a Yakuza boss walks into a sauna completely naked and forces another guy to give him fellatio!)\\n\\n\r\nEven just all the little strange details the show includes makes it so enjoyable to watch as a piece of shlock for me. Such as is the case of the cyborg bodies of both Inuyashiki and Hiro. Not only is the prospect of seeing an old shirtless man flying through the air one that cracks me up, but the fact that this body, which was created by aliens, includes a USB port under one of the fingernails in order to connect it to an iPhone is such a  stupid thing to include, that I burst out laughing when it happened! I guess Aliens also use USBs to connect their iphones to various other devices too?!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, we still haven't got to my favourite element of the cyborg bodies: finger banging! By just simply forming their fingers into the shape of a gun, much like a kid back when I used to play when I was like six-years-old, and then shouting \u201cBANG\u201d they fire off an invisible bullet of sorts, or, in Hiro\u2019s case, using his entire arm to mimic a machine gun while screaming \u201cDADADADADADA\u201d when firing at a bunch of reporters. Just the idea of comparing Hiro playing with guns to that of a child is one that I found so hilarious, but it ultimately falls in line with Hiro's ideology and mindset; he too, thinks in the same rationality as a child would, so it does make sense within the context of his character to act as such.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki\u2019s narrative is comparable to that of a cheesy science fiction and seems to almost revel in that fact. However, there were some elements and ideas present here, that were actually not completely schlocky, that I thought were kind of interesting. Take, for example, where Hiro hijacks people\u2019s phones and TV screens in order to murder them. It\u2019s nothing great, sure, but I liked this idea since it meant that the killer could appear anywhere, at any time, striking people when they are at their most vulnerable, which added a whole new dimension of tension to those scenes in which Hiro goes on a rampage. It's an interesting concept to take a device which is so engraved in our everyday lives and present it as the biggest threat to our survival. However, despite as such, I would be lying if I said that much of my own enjoyment for Inuyashiki\u2019s narrative is indicative of the schlock and stupid premise, which, while entertaining to watch to kill some time, doesn\u2019t offer much besides that. It\u2019s the type of show to watch drunk or high to get the most out of. If you\u2019re looking for something that comments on the true nature of what it means to be human with themes of existentialism and the such, then you will find no such thing here.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of your level of enjoyment of this show stems from whether you enjoy watching bad schlock, and if you can just turn your brain off (since, when you begin to think about each of the world-building elements and ideas then your brain will hurt since nothing makes any logical sense) and just watch all the stupid carnage unfold before your eyes. I had a blast watching Inuyashiki, clearly, and I think that\u2019s worthy of praise if a show can be entertaining, even if that show is indeed bad, but that still doesn\u2019t excuse all the poor writing the show seems to thrive in and the multitude of problems it has. One of the most prolific, and the one that would probably put people off from watching the show altogether is the strange tonal shifts the show has, going from goofy hijinks with an old man attempting to fly, to the straight up murdering of young children and babies. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the second episode of the show, which shifts to the point of view of Hiro, our antagonist, something the show does rather frequently during its run. At the end of this episode, Hiro walks into a random stranger\u2019s house, and murders everyone inside, including a small child who is sitting inside a bathtub, as his father cries and pleas for his life, but Hiro finger bangs him regardless. This surprised a lot of people who were not familiar with the manga, including me, since it came so far out of left field, and the show has quite a number of these moments. The killing of children comes across as rather tasteless and a pathetic attempt to seem edgier than it actually is; it\u2019s essentially shock factor, which reminded me a lot of Elfen Lied, albeit nowhere near as extreme as that show, which tried to hide behind a veil of being deep and mature. Inuyashiki has an air of dumb fun and seems to almost partake in making fun of how ridiculous it can be at some points in the show, to the point where it feels that the original writer had just as much fun writing this insane story as I had consuming it. Although, there were a few moments in the show in which I believe were supposed to make the viewer feel sad, or perhaps tense, regarding those moments were people are killed, but I was having just as much fun with those scenes as I would any other in the show, and it\u2019s this strange juxtaposition of what I believe the writer intended an audience to feel, and what I felt, that makes any serious moment fall apart in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has this strange tendency to randomly cut to a character who has no bearing on the overall plot at all, such as a working woman with terminal cancer or a woman on a plane visiting her family. This comes across as jarring and bizarre since the characters are completely inconsequential to the plot, and the show spends a good five to ten minutes on each respective character; it feels like needless padding just for the sake of such. While it does make sense in one or two instances, such as in episode four where we are introduced to two characters who are linked directly to the plot of that episode, which is what triggers Inuyashiki to go and infiltrate that Yakuza hideout I talked about a moment ago, most of the time it just feels worthless, and if it were cut entirely, nothing would be affected. I suppose the point of these random digressions in the narrative is to showcase what the public is thinking and to gain an insight into how Inuyashiki\u2019s efforts are saving people\u2019s lives, but it still feels unnecessary. The ending for the show too, while I won\u2019t get into specific details about it, isn\u2019t exactly the greatest in the world either, and may leave you feeling somewhat irritated as a result, although it didn\u2019t personally annoy as much as it did with others.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Flying Grandpa Simulator are probably the weakest part of the series and feel more so like one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs than actual fleshed out people. First of all, there is Inuyashiki, our protagonist of this tale; a weak and timid old man who, despite working full time to support his family, receives no love or affection for all his hard work. All of Inuyashiki\u2019s family are just so cruel to this poor old man, for seemingly no reason at all! While it is implied that Inuyashiki\u2019s son resents his father because he is being bullied at school because of his poor family income, he still treats his father as if he were a stranger! Perhaps it can be excused since he is young, and being bullied or something along those lines, but his resentment towards his father just comes across more as trite and forced, to manipulate the audience into feeling sympathetic towards Inuyashiki. The show does try to explore the history behind Inuyashiki\u2019s daughter, however, Mari, whereupon we see that as a kid Mari cared for her father dearly, following him about everywhere and crying that he would pass away soon since he looked far older than he was. However, as she grew into adolescence, Inuyashiki explains to Andou that he has not spoken with his own daughter for years now, as she seems to actively try and avoid him at all costs, and it\u2019s never explained why she does this, nor why she holds resentment towards her father. It\u2019s kind of implied that she is trying to prove something to him, that being that she wants to draw manga, but the show doesn\u2019t give any clear insight into why she dislikes her father as much as she does, making her feel more like a one-dimensional twat if anything else. While in the penultimate episode of the show she does once again begin to love her father as before, there\u2019s not really any build-up to this event, aside from one moment in which Inuyashiki, in a conversation with Mari and her mother about her future, says that she should be allowed to pursue what she wishes, that is, drawing manga, or the few scenes where she was following her father around as he cured the sick in various hospitals, but her sudden change regarding her opinion of her father comes so far out from left field and feels jarring as a result.\\n\\n\r\nI expected a bulk on Inuyashiki\u2019s character arc to be centred around him growing in confidence with this new found body and sorting out the various issues with the rest of his family, but that never really happens, nor is any justification given into why his family dislikes him as much as they do. While, certainly, Inuyashiki himself does seem to grow in his confidence, as he finally finds purpose in his life, and a reason for why he was born in the first place, as evident by his monologue in the penultimate episode in which he goes from person to person saving their lives, or healing them from their wounds, in a scene that actually had some heart to it, I wouldn\u2019t say his character is anything substantial or even close to good. He simply represents the human side of the two newly-created cyborgs and that is it. Speaking of such, this leads me to the next character, Hiro, the antagonist of the series, and the representation of the loss of humanity when one becomes a cyborg. Hiro\u2019s character, and the arc he embarks on (or lack thereof) centres around his loss in humanity, as he has to kill others in order to feel human once again, childishly playing a game to determine which house he will enter next to slaughter those who lay within it. Hiro is just a complete psychopath with no emotions or empathy, asking women if they enjoy One Piece while their entire family has been killed! While the show does try and convey this theme of what it truly means to be human regarding Hiro\u2019s character, it falls flat on its face since it\u2019s heavily implied that Hiro was a complete psychopath even before becoming a cyborg, as we learn that as a child he killed small animals and the such. This completely negates all the attempts the narrative has to present Hiro as a victim of circumstance; as a victim of losing his own humanity which acted as the justification he had for killing people, and makes all the moments in the show in which he is breaking down and crying over someone he loved feel all the more ridiculous, as I can\u2019t feel any sympathy towards someone who kills children! His character has no chance to reflect on the misdeeds he has done in the past, nor do we really get a chance to delve into the psychological implications his murdering is having on himself, which just makes him feel more so like a psychotic murderer and nothing else. I don\u2019t believe this is inherently a bad thing, and it works in the show\u2019s favour regarding its shlock value as I mentioned before, but it makes Hiro\u2019s character uninteresting. Simply put, he is the bad guy and must be stopped. Nothing more. Nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters in the show are either just one-dimensional assholes, such as a group of kids in the very first episode who fire fireworks at some poor homeless man, a group of thugs, who, when told they shouldn\u2019t push in front of the line for a taxi by a middle-aged businessman, then escort said man to a park twenty minutes away just to beat the hell out of him because they\u2019re just that EVIL, or random kids making fun of a woman with cancer just to make her all the more miserable, or they\u2019re absolute dumbasses! Every person in the world of Inuyashiki is so damn dumb that I wonder how they even know how to properly breathe! Okay, let\u2019s first discuss Shion, who, after the news is revealed that Hiro is a murderer, and is thus on the run from the police, allows Hiro to stay with her and her Grandmother in her house as a means of protecting and hiding him since she doesn\u2019t believe he would do such a thing. But, this makes no sense as there is no reason for Shion to believe that he isn\u2019t a murderer as she knows nothing about him! To her, he is just a fellow classmate, and the only interaction that she has ever had with him was one case where she asked for Hiro to go out with her, confessing her feelings in the process, whereupon he said, \u201cThanks\u201d and walked away. There is nothing to suggest otherwise that he is not the killer, and it always annoyed me how na\u00efve she was in letting, essentially what is a stranger, inside her home! Her character, as well as that of her Grandma,  are used mainly as a means for Hiro to learn to love people once again, and giving him some kind of reason and drive to fight to protect them, but it\u2019s handled poorly.\\n\\n\r\nBut, compared to the entire Japanese police force, Shion is a goddamn mensa student. The police force, for whatever reason, are incapable of tracking down one single person, and it\u2019s not like Hiro stays inside Shion\u2019s place all the time either. He comes and goes rather frequently, and, in one instance, leaves just to murder some reporters before flying back! With all this travelling, and considering that he is one of the most wanted men in the area, why did it take so long for the police to hunt him down? Even more so when there are hundreds of goddam surveillance cameras all over the place too; surely, they must have been able to catch him on camera or something? Additionally, when Hiro begins his crusade to murder every person in Japan, he takes to the buildings and kills 100 people there and then, before issuing a warning to the rest of Japan that the following day he will kill 1,000. However, despite this massive threat, and proving that he has the means to be able to pull it off, nobody seems to even care! The very next day, despite commenting that there are fewer people out, most people are still working and walking about the area where all those people were murdered, but above all, most people are still using their phones! It was established in the previous attack that Hiro can kill you through a smartphone, or any other device with a screen on it, and here we have idiots walking around with their phones still! Do they actually want to die?! Also, why are the police not doing anything to find Hiro? Like, clearly, he was snipping people with his finger banging from high up on buildings, but where are the helicopter surveilling each building to try and find this guy? Even more so when we learn that he doesn\u2019t even move from his location and just spent the night sleeping on top of the same roof he killed everyone from the day before! What are the police even doing?! One final thing I want to rant about really quick is how each woman in the show, most particularly teenage girls, refer to Hiro as being \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d so much so that there have been several fan groups made about him, and when one girl, during the massacre of 100 people sees Hiro appear on her phone, she blushes and acts like a dumbass instead of being fearful for her life! Why is Hiro being idolised? This is the guy who murdered babies for crying out loud! While the show does too seem to question this, as evident by a couple of police officers who are discussing this fact, this element always bugged me, and I groaned to myself whenever a girl would comment about how \u201chot\u201d Hiro was.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Flying Grandpa Simulator suffers from poor production values too, and while most of the character designs are fine by themselves, in motion, when the use of CGI is used, it can look pretty choppy. The CGI contrasts awkwardly with that of the traditional 2D animation, intermixing both within the same scene haphazardly, sometimes utilising CGI just for walking animation, and it\u2019s incredibly inconsistent to bat. At best, it wasn\u2019t too bad, and the CGI wasn\u2019t obtrusive enough to really pull me out of the show, but at its worst, the CGI models can look hideous! Inuyashiki is far from the worst looking thing I have ever seen, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly good either. As for most of the music in the show, it\u2019s rather forgettable, barring one slapstick piece, that I remember above everything else since it was used bizarrely in a scene that didn\u2019t fit the tone of the piece; a scene in which Inuyashiki has to stop several planes from crashing into the city to prevent hundreds of deaths! It feels pretty jarring and doesn\u2019t work at all. The OP and ED tracks, however, are both excellent! The OP is perhaps one of my favourite opening tracks for any anime, and I\u2019ve listened to it on repeat while writing this review for hours now, I can\u2019t get enough of it. It hypes me up so much, and is so goddamn catchy that I love it! By contrast, the show\u2019s ED takes on a much more sombre and melancholic tone, reflecting the attempted relationship between that of Hiro and Shion, and is also a wonderful piece of music in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Inuyashiki is a bad show; one that is bogged down with poor writing, idiotic characters and mediocre production values, but I loved every second of it! It\u2019s pure dumb shlock on every level, with a premise that I enjoyed due to just how silly it was. But, at the same time, this makes Inuyashiki hard to recommend to people since, as I said before, your level of enjoyment with this show is dependant on whether you enjoy shlock, and if this premise is one that you may enjoy as a \u201cso bad that it\u2019s good title\u201d. As it stands, however, I can\u2019t bring myself to hate this show, despite how poor it actually is, since it brought me nothing but enjoyment, and while I am disappointed on some level with this show, as I\u2019ve heard amazing things about the original source material, this show is certainly a better one than MAPPA\u2019s previous effort, Bukkakegurui, a show that not only was bad but also boring! Inuyashiki, in my opinion, is the good type of bad show. The type, that despite still being indeed bad, is still able to make an entertaining show despite that. With all that said and done, and finally ending my longest review yet, I thank you for taking the time to read this and, who knows\u2026 maybe your grandpa is also a cyborg too!",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nIntroduction:\r\nInuyashiki..... It is the name of the anime I am going to have a review on. Coincidentally, the word \"Inuyashiki\" comes from the main character's full name. The anime Inuyashiki revolves around two men. One is an old man while the other is a young, teen-age high-schooler. You know on most anime the grown-up is always the antagonist of the series and the young ones are the protagonist, gaining character development every episode. Here, the old one is the protagonist and the young is the antagonist on most audiences. I said \"most\" there. Why? The story offers us what are the circumstances of theaged and the youth. The aged worry about family and health while the other worry about his colleagues. Throughout 11 episodes we have seen  the huge differences between the two. Base on the author of Gantz, Inuyashiki is an anime with the dark element shadowing its story. Does being a total human are the only ones have the right to help someone? Is having a human brain and a heart.. really consider someone being human?\\n\r\nDoes being different to everyone really makes u different? Those are the common questions I've come across while watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story of Inuyashiki focuses on the two main characters of the series. I, indeed, to be honest, have a hard time understanding both of them especially the antagonist Shishigami Hiro. With both of them having different ideals crashing like two planets together, it's really hard to get in favor to one of them. The story of Ichirou Inuyashiki is however, simple. He got cancer in an old age. His children doesn't care to him that much anymore unlike when they were kids. And his body is getting weak due to his illness, thus, limiting his work. Then there's Shishigami Hiro. There is no clear explaination on the background of Shishigami Hiro since when he appeared, he immediately showed his powers and how he used it (Like that part when he manipulate the cars to make traffic accident), though one thing is clear to this character. He only have his mother on his side without the father being completely supporting them. I said \"completely\" because yes the father supports them with money, but moral/emotional things? No. This left Hiro with only his mother on his side, devoting to protect her. Also the event (episode 2) of introduction of his friend Ando Naoyuki gave us a clue what's Hiro's personality. Due to his friend's absence because of bullies, Hiro did something. That \"something\" is unpredictable since we are like introduced to it on the spot of the episode where Hiro appeared very first.\\n\r\nThis gave me a conclusion that throughout the story, there will be killings because of Hiro. Killings to protect while Ichirou Inuyashiki is going to stop him on some point in time. Each episode highlights what they are doing while the other is doing something also. This type of segment is a good highlight to the show since the two of them are the main focus of the audience. First 4 episodes (except episode 2) highlighted Ichirou Inuyashiki's perserverance and will to save people even against gangs. Though most of the episodes, reports have sited the \"miracle healer\" which was Inuyashiki himself. Episodes 5 - 11 (9,10,11 for Inuyashiki) gave us Hiro's triggered response. Triggered as in an incident gave way to his mass killings thus, awakening Inuyashiki also to stop him. The final episode (the ending) is quite a good closure to the story as Hiro did something remarkable for the fate of the entire human race (as well as Ichirou Inuyashiki.) and with the ending song on sync with the final moment, you can sense how emotional it was. The story is quite simple and understandable in a viewer's eyes. This what make Inuyashiki a great anime to watch this Fall 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI've already explained that much to understand about the main characters of the story in the \"story\" part. Thus, I will make a short reflection about the other characters. The supporting characters of the story is a strong element here, which gives way to a simple but good story on my perspective. Supporting characters on Hiro's side gave way to an accepting reason or light to Hiro to kill. While the supporting characters on Ichirou Inuyashiki side gives him an influence to save people. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI am not really a fan of CG but Inuyashiki done it perfectly for me. It is indeed watchable and damn the metal parts of the body is quite detailed (as well as the asteroid in the final part) and I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe songs of the anime gave us a clue of how the starting of an episode and a bit of emotional craze of it. The opening by Man With a Mission is very powerful, along with its visuals, giving us a good headstart on every episode.\\n\r\nThe ending is quite sad or emotional on my perspective as we saw characters not on their full form but in white lights. I dont know the meaning of this (or its just a part of the plan) but at least I can give it a thought that\\n\r\nthe ending shows us the value of each characters to other characters (my own opinion only).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall thoughts:\\n\r\nIt's really obvious that if you go through my review is that I enjoyed this anime in a great way. With its story along with characters on sync, its safe to say that this anime is worth to watch. Overall, I recommend you to watch it. An anime about two characters having different ideals crashing to each other. Then at the end, it all comes down to the human emotion.",

            "content": "> \u201cAre my father and little brother dead too?\u201d\r\n> \u201cWhat does that matter? We were talking about One Piece.\u201d\r\nI want to take you back to 2004, where an anime called Gantz was released; a gritty, gruesome action show from arguably the most inconsistent anime production studio: Gonzo, and it was a fucking train wreck! The finest example of a poor plot turned bombastic; gore, sex, nudity, profanity, it\u2019s all here and is so nonsensical yet outrageous to the extreme, it can only be compared to shitty OVAs of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s that had next-to-no restrictions on what they could do. Unfortunately, due to factorslike fluctuating quality in animation, marketing and just being a downright insane show, other anime such as Monster, Paranoia Agent, SAC: 2nd GIG and Elfen Lied found large fanbases and have been fondly remembered whereas Gantz has been somewhat lost in the shuffle over the years. And those who have seen the show, while there might not be much to say about it positively, can certainly agree that Gantz was one of the most enjoyable pieces of schlock they have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a long 13 years.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is this decade\u2019s Gantz, albeit toned down in sheer crudity yet never eases on being an insane power fantasy romp. It is a sci-fi action series based on the manga of the same name from mangaka Hiroya Oku, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, he\u2019s the same guy behind the manga for Gantz. Coincidence? The story tells of Ichiro Inuyashiki, a middle-aged man that appears almost twice his age who\u2019s down on his luck, being ignored by his own family and finding out he has stomach cancer. Just when all looks bleak, he is killed by a UFO before being rebuilt as an invincible superweapon capable of saving lives and destroying the world. That\u2019s right, aliens pop out of nowhere to turn man into machine with the purpose left in question. But he was not the only person rebuilt as such, and while Ichiro sees this as a way to do more good in his life, Hiro Shishigami is an edgy teen that does what he pleases with his new power, most of which involves slaughtering as many people as he wishes. The plot may seem complex but it\u2019s really just an eccentric take on the \u201cGood v Evil\u201d dynamic commonly used. The premise overall is very intriguing, but what matters more is the execution; how well-handled the show was, and this is where my problems with Inuyashiki begin.\\n\\n\r\nThe series focuses on the two main characters, showcasing how they each come to terms with their newly acquired power in their own daily lives, whilst highlighting the contrast in their beliefs and newfound purpose. This contrast is not hard to pick up on, with Ichiro wishing to help those in need and use his power for noble and virtuous reasons, and Hiro\u2026. Well Hiro\u2019s reasons are never really explored \u2013 we only see Hiro abuse his abilities how he damn well pleases because he can. Hiro comes off as a child with this mentality, except even a child would have a more distinct personality than what we have here; a mindless psychopath devoid of human emotion \u2013 an android in both anatomy and mentality. Unfortunately, there are no flashbacks or scenes of Hiro\u2019s past to show what he was like before the night he was killed, and that provokes one to question if Hiro is simply the character meant to be the villain and nothing more. Compare his situation to Ichiro, an old man that has his problems in life made evident, and when he gains insurmountable power he retains how he thinks and feels about others. Ichiro is no perfect character either; empathy for the man is difficult when personal issues are crammed into the first episode before being practically erased afterward, along with minimal time and focus on the relationship with his family, but at least I can say that Inuyashiki is a proper character that comes across like a real person. Whereas Hiro ends up feeling like the antagonist out of necessity for the plot to move forward, whilst allowing for a small group of fans to self-insert as the suave-looking overpowered badass with the world at his feet.\\n\\n\r\nThe points above may seem small when looking at the overall picture, but these minor issues become heavy burdens on the story of Inuyashiki when you look at the structure of the series. The first episode is all about Ichiro and crams a lot of content aimed to put sympathy on his character. At first it seemed an odd choice by staff, but looking back it\u2019s easy to see why considering how most of the following episodes focus on Hiro and how he causes mayhem. It\u2019s hard to not see so much of this cool, calm and crazy teenager murder so many people with Wind Style: Air Bullets and not think that the show only cared about the amount of bloodshed they could animate across the show\u2019s runtime. Initially Hiro also uses his strength for his one friend Andou to stop him from getting bullied, but even when he distances himself from Hiro it does not change Hiro in the slightest. The way the show tries to intertwine both Ichiro\u2019s and Hiro\u2019s separate arcs fails to get viewers to empathise for either main character with one only shown to be on his own one-man rampage from the start, and the other having his arc glossed over as he is thrown into having to be the one to stop the rampage. With the exception of a few times, Ichiro is chasing around Hiro when committing evil acts, stagnating much chance of his character development taking place and putting all the attention on the slaughter. This would not be as big of a problem if Hiro\u2019s character wasn\u2019t built on unexplained motives, coming off so bland and lifeless to the core that both men end up being as one dimensional as the show. The ambiguity was what peaked my interest, but that turned into disdain when you figure out many aspects of the story stays in ambiguity.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst parts of Inuyashiki come when they try to take moments of pure schlock seriously and attempt to have viewers empathise with the people in the show. First off, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to feel for a character like Ichiro when parts of his life are brought up at whatever time is convenient for the show. You can\u2019t expect to exploit a character arc so sporadically and have viewers still feel so strongly for him when they themselves are trying to wrap their head around what is even happening with the story. And Hiro, while having more time and attention put on him, is even more laughable to feel bad for when all he does is murder in the most apathetic ways conceivable, from shooting at pedestrians on a whim to asking a girl what manga she likes after killing their family beforehand and her soon after. He is a psychopathic murderer with the most interesting part about him being that he\u2019s a psychopathic murderer. Real sad. As for one-off characters, their screen time is more of a result of poor pacing than anything else, and it\u2019s hard to feel sympathy for what is happening to random people in the show when the show itself is primarily concerned with being a bloody gore fest. Now a show like that is not inherently bad, but it needs to be self-aware enough to not rely on viewers feeling sympathetic for brutal acts on random bystanders, otherwise you come off as shallow. The pacing is also a constant issue \u2013 the ratio of chapters to episodes is 85:11, meaning that the show is going to be fast as fuck at potentially skipping key events present in the manga to compensate for the amount to content. This only adds to the already apparent problems in the narrative and characters, giving a show with so much violence almost no breathing room, its audience practically being bombarded with carnage being succeeded with more carnage, only separated by Ichiro attempting to save the day and a god-awful romance subplot that makes no sense even for blind teenage love. The ending also suffers from the pacing, being incredibly rushed that even with how clich\u00e9 and contrived it was, any emotional impact it had on viewers had the weight of a slight breeze. Inuyashiki was never intended to be an emotional story and here it should have never become one.\\n\\n\r\nIt is obvious that Inuyashiki is more concerned with being about senseless fun than a battle of morals between good vs evil represented by two men not even human anymore, but for a show about being entertaining at such a base level, it was a boatload of fun to watch. The ridiculous of it all works to its favour, getting away with some the most shocking yet hilarious moments I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Seeing CGI-animated men fly through the sky at night alone is funny enough, but having a man-child act as if he were holding on to an imaginary assault rifle, before massacring everyone in sight while saying \u201cDADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA\u201d takes the hilarity to a whole new level. Events such as shooting people through their mobile phones, fighting an entire crime syndicate with technique from World Star Hip-Hop and learning to fly from channelling\u2026 Astro Boy?? How one cannot laugh out loud when watching this amazes me. Even when the main lead\u2019s cybernetic enhancements are never looked into over the 11-episode duration, I can\u2019t even be mad at this point. This is schlock to the max and is only concerned about being schlock with no thin veil of depth hiding its true intentions. If years later if I forget the show or the characters, at least I\u2019ll remember the moments that made Inuyashiki what it really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation can be hit-or-miss depending on how you feel on CGI, and while I do think that CGI can be utilized well in anime, it feels out of place for the most part here. Initially this style is used only to show how complex Ichiro and Hiro are when they transform into the primitive mechanical lifeform, but from there its used more and more to where even basic walking will be computer-generated at some point. It becomes incredibly jarring when the show switches from the traditional 2D art style to 3D animation, and can also just look downright hideous, comparable to graphics from a PS1 era game. While it does makes everything look stupid and ergo more entertaining on a superficial level, it\u2019s more of a detriment to the show overall. It\u2019s such a shame that this show had this kind of animation quality behind Studio MAPPA, one that is praised for their high production values for anime the likes of Shingeki no Bahamut and even Garo: Vanishing Line, which came out the same time as Inuyashiki and looks much better despite being a lot less popular. Inuyashiki by no means looks like one of the worst anime ever \u2013 that\u2019s asinine to believe, but I expected better. MAPPA, you got to stop letting me down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it has its own share of problems. The soundtrack is forgettable and won\u2019t affect the experience at all. What is top-tier though are the OP and ED; both are awesome. The OP by Man on a Mission features the most metal theme I\u2019ve heard all year and never skipped. Definitely the most hype openings and one of my favourites for sure. The ED however seems somewhat underappreciated, coming off as sombre and melancholic, envisioning the romance between Hiro and his lover and make it a little more bearable than what we were given in the show. All in all, both are great and one will probably appreciate them both more than the actual show. The voice acting here is very awkward, with some casting choices that have left me scratching my head wondering why were they chosen. Hiro\u2019s voice actor is not good but at least I can say he sounds his age. Ichiro\u2019s voice actor makes it as if his geriatric disease was out of control and he was in his early 20\u2019s the entire time. Maybe an English dub will fix this, but as for now I can only judge it by how I heard it and it wasn\u2019t pretty.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Inuyashiki is the kind of anime you\u2019ll enjoy on the surface, since there isn\u2019t anything deeper going on than an edgy teen acting like a supervillain with Ichiro nearly always appearing too late to stop him. It\u2019s definitely an experience that most anime fans won\u2019t have seen before, providing the kind of shocks and thrills that will get you easily hooked to the show. Is it poorly written? Yes. Does it have poor characters? Absolutely. Are the production values bad? Well they certainly aren\u2019t great. But was it fun? OH HELL YEAH! Some of the purest schlock I have had the pleasure to come across, and no matter how many problems I can point out with this show, I cannot bring myself to hate it. One could call it so bad it\u2019s good, but terms such as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d do not do the show justice when it comes to expressing how I felt about Inuyashiki. If you\u2019re looking for an anime that you want to enjoy and is unlike everything you have probably ever come across, this might very well be what you\u2019re looking for.\\n",

            "content": "Most of the current reviews are due to watching few episodes instead of the being up to date so I'd advise reading this review first and/or not being able to handle real world situations that aren't graphic but touch on sensibilities.\r\nThis series has 2 protagonists; it's essentially showing you how a good person vs an evil person would handle becoming a god and what happens when they figure out each others existence. The beginning episodes are meant to highlight their intents and their sense of purpose or malice. It's essentially a take on if god and the devil were both on earth and showing thechaos and miracles that ensue. The characters are written extremely well; you truly get a sense for their personality, morals etc. in the first two episodes. The art and sound are both top tier; but the art isn't on the level of lets say magus bride or houseki no kuni. The sound also has some instances where a simple musical piece would enhance it big time but it's not lacking; just not top end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a seinen show and if you want a 2 dimensional anime instead of something where you actually have to find meaning in, instead of it being shoved in your face. It's both beautiful and brutal so I'd watch the first three episodes and make your decision(you'll get a feel for what to expect and how good will truly be good and evil will be evil and make you feel disgust). From there you should get a pretty good feel for how the plot is going to be told. It will make you feel human watching it; the purpose is to turn you off from violent scenes instead of glorifying them like most generic shows do. If anything it's about how you as a human react and truly asking yourself \"what would I do given these powers\" and truly thinking instead of saying \"x is bad I'd be a hero\" truly think. During the most recent episode just putting yourself in the position of either character; the choices you'd have to make will not just impact you but every one around you and weigh heavily on you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's worth watching 3 episodes if you can handle adult themes; this is an anime that's rated 17+ for a reason so younger viewers shouldn't start it if they can't handle suggestive themes like lets say, graphic violence, sexual themes, drug usage, psychological themes and emotional distress.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR; if you can handle big boy topics it's good; if you don't want to be exposed to them don't. This means being able to handle touchy subjects and seeing them from others perspectives.",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!!! Review*\r\nTL;DR: No, this is not a Inuyasha remake. It's your typical Japanese Shounen version of \"Breaking Bad\" but with good vs evil mindless sci-fi that makes you question, who would win? Some edgy teenager or some wholesome grandpa! Oh there is also Anime Trump!\r\n[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 5/10, Art: 4/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"So, you're telling me... I'm the villain?\" - Hiro Shishigami\r\nInuyashiki is your classic psychological sci-fi anime, by the visionary mangaka, Hiroya Oku (GANTZ), where the core idea explores the juxtaposition of two ideologies centered around a single question: \"What makes a person \"human\"? Especially when that person used tobe a human but after a slight alteration with Aliens, they are nothing more than a reconstruction of themselves out of spare parts. This anime is a bit twisted at times when looking at humans moral ethics and at times ludicrous with its out of character \"bang bang\" fight sequences. However, it is enjoyable to watch albeit its questionable CGI animations and over the top finger banging skills. Regardless, if you don't mind watching a mindless yet mind-tickling sci-fi action flick, then just watch it. The story in a nutshell is about a shunned Grandpa, Inuyashiki, who dies by alien crash, gets resurrected as a machine with all of his feelings intact and serves justice. Little does he know, the same fate happens to Shishigami but instead of serving justice he commits mass murder. The interesting part of the story is that they both have the exact same power and limitations however one feels humanly emotions from saving people and the other from killing people. This very simple good vs evil setup helps us explore and enjoy the show rather than getting caught up in a convoluted ambiguous melodramatic plot drama. The story is edgy and real to an extent that you can sort of question yourself, \"well, if I don't know them, do their lives really matter to me.\" Regardless, the story is adapted pretty well by Studio MAPPA and has a solid ending. Whether it is good or bad that's for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\n\"He isn't Hiro anymore. He is just a killing machine.\" - Naoyuki Andou\\n\\n\r\nThe fun part about this anime are the characters. They main two characters Inuyashiki and Shishigami are polar opposites of each other. They are juxtaposed so well that each of them become foils for one another. You have the morally ethical eponymous protagonist, Inuyashiki, on one end of the spectrum and then you have the chaotic unethical eponymous antagonist, Shishigami, on the other end of the spectrum. Best part is, they don't really realize if they are the typical \"hero\" or \"villain\" till half-way through the anime. The side characters aren't too well developed other than Andou, who is best friends with both Shishigami and Inuyashiki and acts as the control variable or represent the viewer evaluating the decisions of both. In a way, it just makes this unrealistic sci-fi anime more realistic and grounded to our society. \\n\\n\r\n\"I want you to spend the rest of your lives thinking about the people you\u2019ve hurt and the lives you\u2019ve ruined.\u201d - Ichiro Inuyashiki \\n\\n\r\nAside from the linear plot and polar opposite characters, for a studio like MAPPA, the CGI animation didn't really live up to its expectation as the show progressed from the first few episodes. By the end, the CGI animations in the fight sequences seemed choppy and some frames were noticeably poorly drawn. If they maintained the quality throughout, this show could've been even better. However, the OP Song \"My Hero\" and the ED song \"Ai wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi e\" were really suited for this anime. They are fun to listen to over and over again. The background score was pretty decent. However, since this anime did deals with death a lot, maybe more violin background scores could've enhanced the show. Lastly, the seiyuus did a great job. They made every character feel important. The seiyuu for Inuyashiki was spot on. Kudos to him. \\n\\n\r\n\"Anyway, did you hear? There are already 10 fan clubs for Shishigami\" - A mindless chick from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Inuyashiki is your typical mind-tickling sci-fi anime about two people with the same power but different goals; where one feels alive when saving lives and the other feels alive by taking lives. Sure it deals with some moral ethical dilemmas however it's a show meant to not be taken itself too seriously. If you prefer serious psychological shows, then Parasyte is what you are looking for. Nevertheless, If you don't mind mishandled CGI animation and want a good laugh by watching a kickass Grandpa, then definitely give this show a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Bang! \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!\\n",

            "content": "The leaves have fallen, the windy days and chilly mornings have appeared; it's the start of the best season of the year. With my favourite's month arrival, we got quite a pack of new anime to digest with a wide range of emotions. Different studios have yet again filled our ever-hungry stomachs with their representatives, ranging from action-centred goodies to cute girls and finishing on edge fiesta blobs. There was Wit's newborn hot show, which has completely stolen the spotlight as the most popular non-sequel, Pierrot's abomination, J.C.Staff's new food porn and more, yet even though I had so many pieces of work to pickfrom, there was only that one show which instantly grabbed my attention and didn't let me go from it... it was Inuyashiki.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime takes place in modern age Japan, where our main character Inuyashiki Ichirou lives his unlucky life. His family neglects him and by the end of the day, a doctor diagnosed him with stomach cancer. In anger and sadness, he ran to what appears to be a public park to lament his cursed life. A blinding light came out of nowhere and Ichirou wakes up in the morning, only to discover he's been made into a robot. Sounds somewhat neat right? I mean, how often do we get to encounter a protagonist who's a 58-year-old man given a chance to save people's lives with the use of an unknown power? Yet, at first, I had mixed feelings about the show, mainly due to the massive number of times of discussions regarding its source material's quality. The fact that MAPPA, a studio which has already demonstrated me that I shouldn't trust it when it comes down to interesting premises, was behind it didn't help to remove that precariousness by a single bit. And as it turned out, my inner worries were right.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Inuyashiki is as irritating and wacky as one can get! Yes, we did have some fantastic moments here and there; the second and third episodes were shining like diamonds on a dark and cloudy sky, but the rest of it felt like an utter joke. Take for instance the 4th episode: an ordinary and innocent family was introduced to us in order to let the cliched and evil highly ranked member of a crime syndicate ruin their day. But don't you worry, Inuyashiki is here to save the day! It wouldn't normally bother me; I'm watching an anime with a hero with it, moments like that are unavoidable, heck, they're part of hero's life and at one point or another, we would get a situation like this. Sadly enough, this show is constantly using this scheme: Establish a character, less or more deeply and throw him or her into a situation where Inuyashiki is the only hope for them. The already brought up 4th episode might have the most eye-catching example of this, yet there are more instances of it. In the episode 7th, a businesswoman was brought up to our screens to be cured of cancer (Ok, Hiro did it, but it still doesn't change anything.) and in the 9th episode we were shown a completely unimportant background character in a plane, and guess what happened to that plane? It safely landed on the beach, because of the grandpa's aid. Definitely, the worst of them all, is the case of Mari. She started getting a lot more screen time before, we knew more and more about her and her past for what purpose? To be magically saved by her dad in the 10th episode (even though she should be dead by the time of his arrival). Yes, that was the entire point of her character, just like the rest, she wasn't in any way needed in the story, she hasn't done anything to the plot, even with the superior amount of development she received in comparison to others, which is a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nThis series pacing is... special? I could make a gigantic list of times where we saw something happening on the screen, blinked, and magically we were in a completely different place, time and fucking episode. Again, look at the 4th episode since it's just a damn pot full of examples to use. The old man walked into the room with the girl induced with drugs from the \"baddie\", she was laying and screaming on the bed and a second later she's standing in front of Robo Grandpa. I didn't know that this anime had the Flash in it, damn.\\n\\n\r\nThe robotic bodies our main characters got, is the part where Inuyashiki's writing shows how absurd it can get. I understand it. It's an alien war machine, so when Hiro told us that he can tap into all the Internet messaging, police radios, security cameras from around the world, it was rather believable. Heck, even the sentence about sending an American nuclear missile to China without breaking a sweat, was convincing. We saw it's fighting capabilities, weaponry, durability, the autopilot mode, so what's wrong with it? Even though I know all of these pieces of information, I still cannot get around the fact that this show fed us with so many damn plot devices! \\n\r\nOne of which is Hiro's hand handgun (a pun intended), his most signature weapon. Can someone actually explain how does it work? It functions like a \"normal\" pistol, it's barrel is its owner's index finger, right? So, why in the world does saying the onomatopoeia of a machine gun's gun-shot make it shoot like one? It doesn't make any damn sense, but do you know what's even worse? Holding an invisible rifle in your hands and being able to fire it! What the actual hell is it? What's next? An ability to cure diseases? Oh... nevermind.\\n\r\nAnother example would be a USB port underneath Ichirou's fingernail. Why would there be one in a piece of machinery from outer space? I don't think that a race with far advanced technology would go on and use one of these. \\n\r\nBut the ultimate plot device, which made 0 fucking sense, was the ability to transport your projectile/bullet-ish something through your phone's screen right to some guy's mobile device's screen and kill him. How does it work? How does it make any sort of sense to people behind this show? Does it make sense to you? I have spent a good portion of time trying to figure out, how out of mind someone had to be in order to come up with a tumour-inducing idea like this and honestly I still don't know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, let's just say it here; all of them are one-dimensional beyond belief. Because of that, there weren't many figures who I could describe in more than one sentence, besides our main duo for obvious reasons.  Either they were thrown in to serve as a damsel in distress or they would just fill up the background with their presence, and to say it nicely, most of them were bloody morons. We had some random bad kids trying to kill a homeless person with their fireworks for absolutely no reason and some hooligans who wanted to beat the heck out of a random guy for pointing them out that there was a line to the taxi.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's just start with Hiro and, oh boy, what a mess he is. Our main antagonist was, at first presented as a handsome and popular teenager who was killing people to make himself feel alive. However, as the story has continued, it looked like the creator didn't know what he wanted Hiro to be, a psychopath? TV reporters have said that he was killing animals as a child, which literally implies his psychopathic personality, his actions and the sentences he said over the course of the show are the same, so what's the problem? His \"personality\" shifts like a damn wave, from a cold-hearted killing machine to a guy who apparently cares for someone who was stupid enough to bring him home and vice-versa. Every single time Hiro wants to show emotions; they come off as fake, which would make sense in a case of a psychopath. Yet, it feels like they were trying to make our villain look more complex and more humane, but the result they get is an unbelievably unrealistic and plainly fake character. The whole idea of making the most basic embodiment of evil be something else just tripped over its own ambition.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki, on the other hand, isn't that haywire. Even though at times, he was irrelevant to the story he's the centre of, which was a very interesting thing to see. I'm still enormously happy to see that at least as the generic personification of good, he was a pretty okayish mixture of a likeableness and relatability and quite frankly, the reason why I enjoyed plenty of scenes more than I would have. His character actually grew as the show has progressed, which is an achievement in itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe Inuyashiki's animation, the first thing that would come to my mind would be: overly ambiguous and inconsistency. Why do I assume so? Throughout the series, there are many instances of that unfulfilled desire and deviation of quality. They occurred mainly due to the abundance of CGI scenes done so poorly or in even worse cases, the said inconsistency in 2D animation. I almost thought the animators were having a drunk party while they were completing their job when there were scenes with CGI and 2D blended together in the most repulsive way imaginable. The quality of what we were seeing on the screen would jump out of boundaries in order to screw itself up, which at times was both hilarious and plainly depressing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Inuyashiki is in all honesty, is the most valuable part of it. While it does have an equitable share of rather questionable sound effects here and there, I can't stress enough how much I adore these small insert songs and the opening itself. They fulfil their purpose on an actual decent level, getting you in the mood to watch some action. It does create an unsettling feeling inside your body... you just can feel the hype, which doesn't happen all that often. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Inuyashiki? Both yes and no. The number of times when I was scratching my damn head because of the stupidity happening on the screen was huge, yet I couldn't find myself truly disliking it. This series just oozes with an extremely eerie sensation: you know that it's schlock, but at the same time you are enjoying it even in the smallest degree. The sole fact that I've rewatched it says a lot since I haven't done it before. \"Turn off your brain\", a sentence I hate with a burning passion, yet in this case, actually fits perfectly.\\n\r\nI mean, when I was drunk as hell, this series was a top-notch fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Inuyashiki is like a sinewave stuck on its bottom. Inconsistent, rushed and jumbled schlock with so many problems, I could probably cover up the surface of our planet with them. Horrible pacing and characters with either no purpose, development or any logic behind them, which in itself is pretty absent in this PlotDeviceGenerator 9000, are the most noticeable ones.  A \"fast food like\" show, while somewhat enjoyable, would have been a lot better if given enough care and attention to details. A gore fiesta which will, quite literally, make you question whether MAPPA is doing terrible shows on purpose or not. \\n\\n\r\n(As an added bonus, I've counted how many times it has been said that a certain character has or had cancer and guess what? Damn 5.)",

            "content": "Ah, Inuyashiki, a series that had the potential to be a hit, turned into a forgettable experience. I really tried to like this anime but seems like MAPPA didn't want me to. You see, Inuyashiki is an anime full of plot conveniences, asspulls and bullshit. Why? I have several reasons why, as the same way people would have their reasons to say this anime is good, so let's get started. There might be spoilers on this review, so be warned\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nThere is absolutely no story on this anime, nothing meaningful actually happens, there is the concept of \"Good and Evil\" but there isn't anythingworth to be called a \"story\". The anime itself lacks direction, first you get that some aliens crashed and \"accidentally\" killed both the Main Character and the \"Antagonist\", then the same aliens reconstruct them into some sort of automatons. That's it. An \"accident\", there goes the whole argument of the series, the Aliens topic is never touched again, they don't even return to get their weapons back (I mean, they could have returned with some robot pieces that aren't weapons). Let's be aware that this \"accident\" gave powerful weapons to 2 random people and also made them immortal, because why not. Its like activating \"God mode\" cheat on a sandbox game like GTA to create a low tier Michael Bay film. There you have it, Senseless gore fest with no purpose at all. It can be entertaining for a while, but it becomes old pretty fast. Same thing happened to Re:Creators with Altair, it becomes boring with some time and you are just expecting shit to be done for good but it doesn't and it drags a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace on this anime is atrocious, the \"Antagonist\" changes from being a psychopath to a caretaker and back to a psychopath so freaking fast that makes it look like a joke, specially when the anime tries to make you feel bad for the \"Antagonist\". Having such an atrocious pace just backfires, there are better ways to portray a psychopath villain but Inuyashiki fails at it, Its pretty hard to develop good characters in 11 episodes, specially when the pace is as inconsistent as Hiro's behaviour. This anime also likes to add a lot of irrelevant characters to either show how retards they are or just for the sake of plot conveniences.\\n\\n\r\nThe Amount of bullshit that is thrown at your face is ridiculous, people on this anime acts like a bunch of idiots. There were several times where I could hit myself with a brick because of the stupidity of the entire population of Japan (and also the antagonist). Another thing that I found as bullshit is the way how these \"alien weapons\" works, At first it was a bit believable to think that Hiro's \"Handgun\" were an Air compressed weapon, But this is thrown away and it easily becomes an asspull, because somehow with this \"Handgun\" you can kill someone through a screen (Or either form a rifle with your bare hands and make it work like it is real) How convenient. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation on this anime is fairly decent for most of time... That's it, until we get thrown with 3D CGI scenes that pretty much lacks (and sometimes it is quite unnecessary) It looks stiff and poorly made. Even Vanishing Line has better animation than this and it doesn't entirely depends on CG to make good fighting scenes (Take in consideration that Vanishing Line is also being made by MAPPA) 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the voice acting... Some people said that the voice actors are actually Live Action actors and that their role is to sound \"real\", but \"real\" isn't something I can think of when hearing their voices, it isn't entirely bad, but not that good either. The soundtrack of this anime comes in the pack of terrible writing, direction and pace, it doesn't work as intended so of course it won't hit. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI already stated before (and several times on forums) my dislike with the characters. To make it quick, Old Man Inuyashiki is WAY TOO MUCH for this anime, the entire population is way too stupid to even deserve what Inuyashiki did for them. Other than that, The characters on this anime also comes in the pack of terrible writing, pace and direction. Character development lacks when there isn't a significant concept and plot to follow. The way things happens is way to abrupt and very fast paced that the character development is trashed away easily. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd still, after all that clusterfuck of shit happening, this anime were still entertaining. It will satisfy those that doesn't care that much about these details or those that wants some senseless action. But if you can't let certain details aside, I'd recommend you to skip this anime and watch something else. 5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10 (3,6): The terrible direction, pace, and writing killed an anime that could have been a hit. Significant plot is missing, characters executed poorly, plot conveniences, asspulls and a lot of bullshit.\\n",

            "content": "This is a preliminary review.\r\nLong story short.... this is based on manga made by the same person who wrote Gantz. And the author of the original has a problem - he is unable to properly portray normal people + has a huge fascination with bullying scenes and display of power being used to abuse someone in the worst way possible.\r\nBasically, there are two types of characters in many scenes - some menacing threatening all powerful villain (for current scene, anyway) with smug expression on their face, and then some person in the process of being abused - usually in a state of teary mess -with tears, runny nose, sweats, etc, looking all pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this stuff isn't really fun. Because when some sort of confrontation happens between characters in the series, they ALWAYS jump into those two stereotypes, meaning there are a lot of scenes that are pretty much abuse/torture porn. \\n\\n\r\nThe next problem is that when abuse scene starts, the author doesn't really know where to draw the line. Meaning if there's a rape or murder involved it can happen onscreen. This is basically, lack of taste and inability to discern when an on-screen scene is necessary or if it is possible to shock the viewer with implications of something that happened off-screen and fridge logic (which can be more horrific). This problem of the author resulted in extremely poorly done episode #2, which is cringe-worthy and bad overall.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, on some rare occasions where the author finally sees the light in the end of the tunnel and snaps out of his bad habits, there are occasional nice moment. First episode has several good examples of this.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, the anime greatly suffers from poor writing, and poorly written characters. Inuyashiki himself, for example, most believable when he doesn't say anything. As long as he start speaking up, he doesn't really give an impression of a real person. \\n\\n\r\n----\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the show starts with a somewhat interesting premise in the first episode, and with an unusual main character - an old man. However, it ruins the show in second episode with poorly executed shock content sequence which is pretty much \"torture porn\", is handled rather tastelessly, holds no real value and adds very little to the story. All things considered, it looks like the show will continue throwing \"horrifying\" or \"shocking\" scenes at the viewer one after another. Which is just a poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is sad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10.\\n\r\nInteresting first episode, and massive potential behind the primary idea. Poorly written second episode with pointless shock content all over the place which is handled rather tastelessly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nDecent visuals, hand-drawn anime assisted by CG assets, similar to Ajin, Sidonia no Kishi, seikai suru kado, etc. However, visual assets - cg ones - are poorly executed compared to the other shows I mentioned. The computer parts looks clearly CG, meaning they do not blend properly with backgrounds. They are okay, but could've been done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10:\\n\r\nDoes its job but nothing amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10:\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is sympathetic, and very well portrayed in the first episode. However, main antagonist and people the antagonist interact with are poorly done and are uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nTo be fair, it is something like 6/10 for the first episode, and 2/10 for the second. Due to poor handling of violence and shock content. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\r\nWell, at the moment I think a decent idea would be to watch the first episode and drop the show. Based on two episodes it looks like the idea will be to throw more and more horrifying and shocking scenes at the viewer, and that's just cheap. \\n\\n\r\nSo, so far it is a disappointment and there are better animes out there. I'll probably give it a try for a few more episodes, and if it doesn't improve, I will drop it.",

            "content": "The biggest disappointment of the season is definitely Inuyashiki. I wanted to love it, but in the end, it was held back by far too many unavoidable issues. \r\nThe first episode introduces you to the melancholy life of a dying man, Inuyashiki Ichiro, who is in a loveless marriage with two kids that despise him. The director gets you truly feel sad for him through quiet and somber moments of him alone in his everyday life. \r\nI was impressed with how well the director got me to care about a character I just met, but sadly none of the episodes following it quite lived upto its relatively lofty achievement. \\n\r\nIn episode 2 we\u2019re introduced to the psychotic villain Hiro Shishigami, the most undercooked and confusingly written villain I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat broke the show for me:\\n\r\n1. The ratio of chapters to episodes is 85:11. I have no doubt this is the cause of the show's horrible pacing issues and underdeveloped characters.\\n\r\n2. Killing cute little animals doesn\u2019t make you poignant, it\u2019s just edgy and blatant attempt to make the audience feel sad.\\n\r\n3. Shishigami. A villain with unexplained abilities, unclear motives, and no charisma.\\n\r\n4. The unbelievable stupidity of the citizens of Japan, real people wouldn\u2019t just stand around and let themselves be killed!\\n\r\n5. The tone-deaf social commentary. That 9/11 episode. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be social criticism on America, but it came off as incredibly disrespectful and tasteless. It doesn\u2019t matter how many years it has been, there are some lines that you should not cross.\\n\r\n6. The art quality declines and the CGI look like something out of a PS1 era game. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 3/10]\\n\r\nAt first, the ambiguity of how Inuyashiki and Shishigami got powers drew me into the show. You could interpret it by saying that the aliens wanted to test humanity by giving powers to the best and worst humans. However, the longer I watched it the more I realized that the ambiguity is only there to cover up a lack of any lore and avoid world building. There is nothing deeper at play here. Unless you intend to analyze the sick mind of the show\u2019s twisted author. \\n\r\nYou may not feel it now, but once you get to the end you\u2019ll feel as cynical towards the writer as I do now, it\u2019s just incredibly lazily written. \\n\r\nPoorly explain logic to the cyborg abilities. The pacing is all over the place. When a show as full of violence as Inuyashiki doesn\u2019t give its viewers any room to breathe between the horror, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the director didn\u2019t even care whether or not we had the time to analyze what we were seeing. Is it just meant to be a fun thrill ride of super-powered cyborg destruction? If so, then why is there no charm or charisma to the characters? Why do they all have realistic sounding voices and realistic designs? The answer is that Inuyashiki was intended to be taken seriously. However, unless you\u2019re able to turn off your brain you won't get much out of it. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of the show's issues, the ending is fucking awful. It's so rushed that its \"emotional impact\" hits about as hard as a foam bullet from a nerf gun. I had heard from people that read the manga that the ending was bad so I was prepared. However, nothing could have prepared me for how abhorrently cliche and contrived it was. The entire conflict of the final arc starts and ends in the last few minutes of the final episode. This gave me no time at all for the weight of the situation to sink in. \\n\r\nIt's the kind of ending that is so bad that it hurts the overall quality of the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 4/10]\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a great person, but a woefully undercooked character. The first episode does a great job of getting you into his mindset. He\u2019s a kind caring old man who is for (some unexplained reason) hated by his family and ignored by everyone, then he gets cyborg powers (for some more unexplained reasons) and uses them save lives and be the become the best hero ever. We sure lucked out that the guy who got cool cyborg powers was a compassionate old man\u2026 right? \\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Hiro Shishigami, the other guy who got cyborg powers. He\u2019s Inuyashiki\u2019s foil and the show\u2019s main antagonist. You\u2019ve never seen a poker face until you\u2019ve seen Shishigami, but that\u2019s about all that his character is good for. He murders dozens of innocent people with his powers in long and overdone scenes. We get it! He\u2019s a murderer!! You don\u2019t need ten minutes an episode to remind us.   \\n\r\nInuyashiki is pushed aside to make room for the less interesting Shishigami, which in turn means the majority of scenes in the show are unpleasant and full of tasteless violence. The potential of Inuyashiki\u2019s character is never explored. I was expecting we would see a subversion on the hero\u2019s journey trope, but instead all that came from his character was a contrived and overwrought melodrama. He\u2019s comparable to a popped balloon that sprays out hot air and fart noises for 11 episodes. All pathos, no development. \\n\\n\r\nHiro taking center stage is most likely a result of the writer\u2019s obsession with psychopaths and violently killing innocent people because that is just about all Hiro seems to exist for. His logic for doing what he does becomes more convoluted as the show goes on, he changes his motivations at the drop of a hat, never really giving you a chance to analyze his insanity. \\n\\n\r\nTheir conflicting personalities does add some depth to look into. If the good versus evil allegory isn't completely trite to you. Plenty of other better anime have taken on this theme but if you must suffer through Inuyashiki at least you'll have one thing to motivate you to keep watching. It adds an extra layer to read into and its the only character traits that remain consistent throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 5/10]\\n\r\nUgly CGI. It looks just as janky and unfitting to the show\u2019s 2d art as the CGI skeletons from Dies Irae. Incredibly jarring switches from normal art to CGI that breaks immersion constantly. \\n\r\nIn the first few episodes, the CGI is used frugally and only during action scenes, it is used to capture the complexity of the mechanical cyborg components and their small details. At first, I praised the CGI for being used creatively and only when necessary, but in the later episodes, it is used much more. The worst part of the CGI is how awkward the characters\u2019 faces look. It looks like something from a PS1 era game. Even their designs are a bit bland. I\u2019d I expect the designs to be original enough to pick up a bit of slack because the characters have no charisma and very poorly defined personalities. There are better ways to create realistic characters than generic designs and tame attitudes. \\n\r\nFor Inuyashiki to be airing at the same time as the groundbreaking CGI oriented anime \u201cHouseki no Kuni\u201d, it only makes its issues a hundred times worse. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 6/10]\\n\r\nMetal as hell opening and a very mellow ending. Both sound amazing, the opening is really well animated and it sadly becomes the highlight of the show during the final episodes. Good sound effects, but lacking in a certain punch. Even Houseki no Kuni felt more impactful than this. \\n\r\nRealistic voice acting works for drama, but this is an action-heavy show and some of the ranges required the characters were out of the voice actors capabilities. The yelling in particular sound really awkward. It's commendable that they were going for something unique but it didn't work out in my opinion. Oh yeah, I should mention Shishigami's stupid finger gun. \"BANG BANG! BANG!\" That shit got annoying real quick. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3/10]\\n\r\nIt was around episode four that it hit me, Inuyashiki is an anime that actively tries to make you feel horrible. This anime almost always strives to make you feel just as depressed and hopeless as it's characters. And well, it usually succeeded at its pointless goal of upsetting me. If it weren't of such a low quality I probably would have felt depressed through its entire runtime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really for some reason want to feel disgustingly upset for 4 hours straight, well all I can say is good luck taking this show seriously. Due to the head-shakingly stupid reactions of the people of Japan have to the horrors that Shishigami commits it becomes more like a comedy than a tragedy. \\n\r\nPeople get killed in ways that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a show like Ousama game. There\u2019s no logic to how the cyborgs work, at least not in the show. Shishigami kills people through cameras with his finger gun, Inuyashiki heals people from any ailment. I was hoping to get some enjoyment from trying to figure out the alien story and the cyborg originations or even just analyzing the enigmatic Hiro, but nope. Inuyashiki has done such a great job of making me feel cynical towards it. The combination of shoddy visuals, underdeveloped narrative, unexplored characters, and frustrating action made it a slog to get through. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 4.2/10]\\n\r\nA studio as well known as MAPPA seems so lazy to be cutting corners like this especially when smaller studios are producing work that is miles better. The moral of the story? Go watch Houseki no Kuni if you want to see an actually good example of CGI used in a creative way rather than a crutch to support a lack of budget. \\n",

            "content": "First a brief non spoiler review for those who haven't watched it:\r\nInuyashiki is a seemingly ultra violent, schlocky sci fi - bullshit thingy. And as far as that goes, it's excellent. It has good tension building, very tight pacing, very strong characterization, memorable lines, striking visuals (albeit with sometimes so-so CG), interesting social commentary, a great musical score and one of the most badass opening themes in recent memory. On top of that it's a complete manga adaptation with a solid ending.\r\nIt may have some strange writing in places, the story goes in to some wacky directions and the violence ranges from over the topsilliness to just plain depressing and uncomfortable. But all of it is somehow very entertaining nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe following is an analysis of the series full of spoilers.\\n\r\nIf you haven't watched the entire thing do NOT read any further. You have been warned.\\n\\n\r\n--SPOILERS--\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 opens with a pan out shot of an ant crawling out from underneath a car until the MC steps out of his car, while stepping in front of the ant, blocking its path. The ant then changes direction and keeps walking. This is likely foreshadowing the hit and run the aliens do on our main characters later in the episode while also foreshadowing the ending when the asteroid's about to strike the earth. The parallels between these events are fairly obvious if you think about it - giant thing (man/ spaceship/ asteroid) randomly and without any malicious intent comes close to crushing something more vulnerable (man/ant/earth) only for it to survive after altering its course..  This also establishes the running theme of this series which I will get in to. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the episode focuses on the titular character Inuyashiki Ichiro and his mid life crisis. He buys his family a new house that happened to be right next to a rich mangaka's mansion (this briefly comes in to play later) and his family is ungrateful towards his efforts. If that's not enough, Ichiro is informed that he has cancer and only 3 months to live and his only comfort becomes a stray dog that he finds. About midway through the episode the inciting incident happens when Inuyashiki and Hiro get hit and die by accident from an alien spaceship, and then rebuilt as machines with their emotions and memories still intact (I don't know, just roll with it). Ichiro later discovers his new powers when he saves a homeless man (notice that this man was on the payphone promising to find a job and better himself, it's important) from a bunch of teenage thugs. Ichiro then remarks \"I feel alive\".\\n\\n\r\nThis same line is later repeated by Hiro in the very next episode after murdering an entire family. Clearly painting a good vs evil contrast between the two. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode 2 Hiro is introduced as an intelligent teenage boy who's not interested in a social life despite his sharp tongue and good looks. He's asked what he thinks about a hot girl he's shown by his fellow students and his response is how shallow and lacking in personality that girl is and claims that he much prefers a fictional character with an actual personality (in this case, best gir.. er.. I mean Nami from One Piece). \\n\\n\r\nAt least partially, Hiro can be seen as a by-product of society. As a backlash to what the author perceives as a shallow society that judges people based on their looks and not their character (I'll come back to this topic later). \\n\r\nThat's not to say that his actions are shown in a positive light in the slightest. The main purpose of this is to draw a clear line between Hiro and the rest of society. Which is important since he ends up declaring war on that society, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nLater in the episode Hiro sits with Andou, a socially awkward friend of his, in his room who's been absent from school due to being bullied and also happens to be a fan of Gantz (the other manga from the same author as this) and they go back and forth a bit on how Andou can possibly be a fan of such a violent manga. Hiro also points out that the manga has been heavily scrutinized by social media like 2chan (they also come in to play later). Referencing Gantz may seem like this is just the author advertising his own work but I think there's a little more to it. On one side you have Andou who's a gentle non violent person who loves a violent and deeply disturbed manga. This might be commentary about how violent fiction doesn't necessarily cause violence in real life. Or maybe he's just defending his own work, it's hard to tell.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand you have Hiro who's a fan of the lighthearted shonen manga, One Piece which I am sure is not a coincidence. The main theme of One Piece is pursuing your dreams and the power of friendship and, not coincidentally, you see Hiro an episode later murdering the boys who are bullying his friend, all for his sake.. Don't get me wrong, I love One Piece and shonen in general but I think the implication is that Hiro has taken the manga's message to an extreme. It's not unheard of for sociopaths to have people they feel content being with, even if it doesn't come from a particular fondness of those people and more so about their own well being. And it's clear he never was a normal person, it is mentioned in passing that he used to kill animals as a child for fun, and the suicide he witnessed at the train station screwed him up further which gave him a sensation and a lust for human blood. It's also the event that likely lead him to contemplate in the park where the aliens crashed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe only person he seems to show genuine affection for is his mother who divorced her husband and presumably worked her ass off to raise him. She even has cancer and weary eyes that make her appear older than she is.. Sound familiar?\\n\r\nLater in the series he also forms a connection with a girl from his school and her grandma. But this connection is mostly one of convenience and doesn't seem all that genuine due to his body language when with them and that he even considered killing them in their sleep.\\n\\n\r\nEvery day happy families also seem to make Hiro feel discontent due to his split up family background even if he's not fully aware of it. This is demonstrated in episode 2 and 3 when he breaks in to random family's houses and murders every family member.  Even in the first family he killed there's a particular emphasis on when he kills the father of the household - the father's body falls on his child while they're in the bathtub drowning him, making it seem almost as if the father himself was the one strangling him. You can see this alluding to Hiro's disdain for (or his general relationship with) his father which we know he's not very fond of.. He seems to visit his father's new family out of obligation and nothing else. Or maybe it's just cruel senseless violence for the sake of it. Sure. But whether you like hearing this or not, children without fathers in the house are more likely to become criminals, drug addicts or screwed up in some way. \\n\\n\r\nSociopaths are also known to be highly intelligent which Hiro demonstrates very well with his sharp, opinionated dialogue and quick learning skills of how to use his new body (and by liking Nami ofc). He learns pretty quickly how to hack any computer he wants and to use all the dangerous weaponry at his disposal. Meanwhile, we see the average salary man, Ichiro struggling to learn how to fly, heal people etc'. Even by the end of the series Hiro is way ahead of him to the point where he already figured out how to self destruct. This also might be commentary on their age difference and how older people are less familiar with modern tech. Which seems to be reinforced when Andou teaches Ichirou how to turn his body in to a cell phone.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do think Hiro is an amoral individual to the core that doesn't mean he's not capable of doing good things too. Him going around curing people from terminal diseases was a good thing in practice, but it was not done out of the goodness of his heart, but for his own benefit in pleasing his girlfriend. Manipulating others and adjusting your persona is all part of being a sociopath. It's also worth mentioning that this short lived change in Hiro's ways is a result of a completely random encounter with this girl, which ties in to both the beginning and ending of this story that are made up of life changing random occurrences.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the above are clues we get about Hiro throughout the series. we never actually get a full backstory or inner monologue because that will evoke sympathy which I'm positive is not the intent of this story. Thus it also stands to reason that this series begins by fleshing out Ichirou's personal life before the alien crash happens, while Hiro doesn't get the same treatment and we only experience his character after the fact\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of Hiro's mentality, in the last stretch of episodes he declares war on the entirety of Japan. Which seems over the top but in this point in the story the police are after him, his mother already committed suicide, his semi girlfriend, her grandma and even his friend Andou don't want anything to do with him anymore. He even stole a bunch of money for them and they refuse to use it out of principal. He's basically making up for his loss by killing people one by one which is clearly his favorite pastime. It's either that or he just runs away and hides somewhere for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason Hiro sacrificed himself in the end seems to be ambiguous. Sure, he said it's for his girlfriend and Andou, but there's evidence that suggests otherwise: \\n\r\nFirst, lets not forget that his body is wrecked, he's crippled for life, just like the gangsters Ichiro confronted early in the series. Second, as stated above he has nothing left to live for. Third, He didn't look Ichiro in the eye when he gave him that reason, despite looking him in the eye in his next line of dialogue - suggesting that he's lying (if you look at the equivalent manga chapter [82] this is even more apparent, I looked it up for this). Fourth, an episode earlier he discovered that he's the villain and Ichiro is the hero in the eyes of the public and he was very upset about it to the point of tears. Ichiro also informs him that saving people is what makes him feel alive. And shortly before he sacrifices himself, Andou tells him that he's not Hiro (a Hero) anymore, just a reckless killing machine, which results in him shedding tears once again ...\\n\r\nConclusion: he didn't mind dying at this point in the story anyway and wanted to be the hero for once, inspired by Ichiro's heroism for the wrong reasons, he did it for his self image and 'feeling alive' one last time. I'm guessing that's the reason for his heroic sounding name.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro on the other hand is the ideal hero we all want, but still relatable and human in his own right. Indiscriminately saving both humans and animals alike. He goes around in hospitals curing people who are terminally ill and he beats up thugs. \\n\r\nFurthermore Ichiro actually had all the trappings of being a villain himself - in the beginning of the series he was 3 months away from death, his family barely talks to him and he looks 20 years older than he really is, which is probably a result of him working to the bone to support his family. There's even a symbolic image in the opening theme that shows him with what appears to be a factory popping out of his body while lying on his back, suggesting that he's working himself in to an early grave (something that's known to happen in Japan). This is just speculation, but I suspect that his overwork might also play a part in his neglected relationship with his family. \\n\r\nAnyway, All of this is a good excuse for him to be angry at the world, and despite that he still remains a good person and sticks to his principles to the end. Hiro's problems are peanuts compared to his but due to their age difference and general attitude towards life, Ichiro is experienced enough to know the consequences of his own actions. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting thing about him is that he's not perfect and his extreme naivety can also lead to some morally questionable actions as well. Like leaving a bunch of gangsters blind and crippled for life when simply killing them would've been more humane. You even see how hesitant he is at first on whether to put himself in danger for others, like any human being would. Hell, in the final battle he even blows up a satellite with the debris falling on the ground unintentionally putting the people below at risk (though to be fair, it's preferable to the risk of Hiro massacring them). That aside, his impact on random people that he saves (who get fleshed out well for minor characters, btw) is implied. The most prominent one is the character arc involving his daughter learning to appreciate him and applying for Shonen Jump which was very sweet. It goes to show that good deeds aren't just good on their own, but they may also inspire others to better themselves. While Hiro's perceived \"good deeds\" lead to nothing but tragedy for himself and others.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro remains the ideal hero we all want and adore and I wouldn't have it any other way. The man helps others without a second thought and doesn't brag or feel the need to be praised for it. After all, the man went out of his way to hide his powers from the public  (because apparently Japanese hospitals don't have security cameras lol). On the other hand, it did cross my mind that he might be doing these things solely to 'feel alive' (because that's what he says) which is the same selfish reason Hiro has for killing people. But it's made clear that he has his heart in the right place and we see that he's genuinely distressed when someone else is in danger, even a stray cat.  And as I've demonstrated with Hiro, this is a series where actions speak louder than words.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is heartbreaking that he couldn't stay with his family in the end and that the circumstances forced him to change course - at the end of the day, he wanted his family and the entire earth to keep living because of his good nature. He's the man who shows that not all hope is lost and fills the role of our 'Last Hero'. The fact that even the last thing we see in the final episode consists of his daughter being accepted in shonen jump and his son fighting bullies implies that his sacrifice will have a lasting impact on a larger scale and that society won't stay as shallow and amoral as the author suggests through out the series. I'm sure the homeless man from episode 1 followed through on his promise to better himself too.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up how I view the main characters' I'm gonna say that they're both separate from the author's largely negative view of society. Both of them don't fit in to their surroundings for different reasons and the decision to cast live action actors to voice them seems like an attempt to make them stand out as much as possible.  They're also polar opposites of each other, one has no trace of empathy for others while the other (arguably) has too much empathy. They make up the best and worst of humanity, while the general public are varying degrees in the middle, not sure which side they will end up gravitating towards. That is of course until the end - where it becomes clear that Ichiro won, and not because he won the fight (though that helps too) but because he helped inspire others and made their lives better and even went as far as to inspire a murderous sociopath to do the right thing that only he is capable of doing, even if it's for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters aside, now is a good time to expand a bit more on the social commentary. I thought it was clever that most people kept using cellphones even after Hiro was able shoot and kill people through them and they were explicitly warned about it. The way it was portrayed was over the top, sure, but it's clear that the author is well aware of how stupid it is, otherwise he wouldn't call attention to it repeatedly and so blatantly to the point of even having a character say the line: \"I'd rather die than not have a phone\". \\n\r\nObviously this is also commentary on our over reliance on these gadgets. It's funny too since both of the main characters would literally die if not for their mechanical bodies (which also happened to be used as phones occasionally lol).  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I liked how the main character's mechanical bodies weren't explained verbally, instead we're shown how they work visually. \\n\r\nFor example there's apparently an emergency mechanism for when the body is in danger and the user is knocked unconscious (through heavy blows) and a little camera appears at the back of the head and starts shooting lasers everywhere like some kind of home security system. Which is probably why when Ichiro gets shot repeatedly in the back of the head at one point, he's knocked unconscious and the camera doesn't come out.  We also see that water is helpful in oiling it back up. I even liked how clear it was that Ichiro was not a skilled fighter despite the mechanical body. When he fights some thugs at one point he just sloppily swings his fists around like an amature would.. \\n\\n\r\nBack to the commentary: Hiro gaining a fanbase as a mass murderer is due to his looks. Not only is it not unrealistic, sadly, but judging a book by its cover is also a recurring theme in the series. Most notably when Hiro refuses to acknowledge a woman based on her looks in episode 2. Or when people consider Ichiro an elderly when he's only 58 years old (rightfully so in his case) or earlier in the series when he saves a couple that consist of an ugly man and a beautiful woman, while the people surrounding them look at them funny for that very reason. Hell, that same woman later gets kidnapped solely because of her looks. And lastly a female cancer patient crying in the street while kids point at her, calling her \"ugly bitch\". This idea brilliantly came full circle and right back to Hiro who rejected it in the first place. It's consistent with how the general public was depicted through out the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the whole asteroid thing towards the end. This was introduced around episode 8 and at first I thought it was a lazy excuse for a shoehorned climax.. But by the time it ended I realized that it did give the series a high note to end on and it gives the main characters closure that was in tune with their motives and it's also a nice callback to the very beginning. Accidents like Ichiro almost stepping on an ant, forcing it to alter its course. Aliens crashing on earth which resulted in the main characters pursuit of feeling alive again through different means. Hiro changing his ways, briefly, thanks to a random encounter with a girl who confessed to him earlier. And lastly, the asteroid which forced the main characters to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, accidents don't make for good storytelling methods, especially when it comes at the very end of a story.. But accidents are a part of life and I think this is all part of the 'set in the real world' vibe this show is going for. I don't think it's a coincidence that live action actors were hired as part of the voice cast and many real life events, figures and organizations are mentioned throughout the series.  Gantz, the 9/11 look alike and that the president is Donald Trump (and not some random fictional president) and that Ichiro's neighbor is apparently Eichiro Oda and 2chan being a thing, or an ad for 'Man with a Mission's new album (the band that sings the op song) being displayed in the street, Shonen Jump, One Piece,  etc', etc', etc'. \\n\r\nThis is even reflected in the fairly realistic character designs, mechanical designs and background art. And heck, even in small seemingly pointless sequences like seeing the dog randomly trip off the stairs or Hiro realizing that he can't speak in space, only to use his phone 2 seconds later. These are types of things you normally wouldn't see in a fictional story. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this leads me to suspect that the author and the high caliber director, Keiichi Sato knew exactly what they were doing when making this. Life just doesn't always go as planned and we need to change plans accordingly, try to better ourselves to the best of our ability and make the best out of a bad situation. That's what this series seems to be about. \\n\\n\r\nOr maybe it's just a schlocky sci fi title with senseless violence. That works too lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\n----END OF SPOILERS--\\n\\n\r\nAt face value, I'd say this still is a good vs evil type of story, showcasing both the best and worst of humanity and everything in between. I don't always agree with the social commentary, but it's timely and interesting nonetheless. It also doesn't feel the need to spell everything out, its characters are entirely defined by their actions and surprisingly, its message is a lot more optimistic compared to this author's previous work.",

            "content": "After watching the first three episodes, and seeing how many reviewers summed this anime up as \"torture porn\", I felt the need to contribute a contrasting viewpoint. Now that I have watched 9 episodes, my feelings have not changed.\r\nWhat we are seeing is the complete deconstruction of good versus evil, superhero versus supervillain, protagonist versus antagonist. And the two central characters are an exercise in this. What some reviewers are calling \"torture porn\" is actually the unflinching portrayal of pure evil. It pulls no punches. Is it necessary for the character to do the things he does? No. This is what makes him *truly* evil.He has absolutely everything going for him--from age, to looks, to intelligence, to strong friendship--and still he uses his new-found power this way. Is it necessary for the audience to see him do the things he does? I would argue an emphatic yes. Because we see the direct contrast in the protagonist. He is *pure* goodness. He has every reason to be full of hate and resentment--ungrateful family who mistreats him, advanced aging in his appearance, complete lack of power to change his circumstances--and still he is brought to tears when he discovers he can use his power to help people and *do good*.\\n\\n\r\nIt's powerful. It affects you. It almost brought me to tears in the span of three episodes. That's what great writing can do.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of torture porn out there, and I would agree that it serves no purpose. This show is not one of those cases. It's not for the psychologically squeamish, given the severity of the evil on display; but the villain's arc is no more \"torture porn\" than the hero's arc is \"altruism porn\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd no one has accused it of that yet.",

We are shown ambiguous characters, with no \"good\" nor \"evil\", as they acknowledge their mistakes and learn from them. From a philosophy standpoint, there are intriguing reasons why every action by the main cast is done.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art in Inuyashikiis expressive and shows some characters\u00b4s faces can look good, and still look like a human being, not like the usual trend of drawing people whose faces are are distinguishable only by their hair, eye color and age. The direction is also impeccable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say about this aspect, only that it fits very well. MAN WITH A MISSION\u00b4s \"My Hero\" is a very well made and skillfully put together OP too, that also fits perfectly the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are likable, interesting, and relatable with each one\u00b4s personality being completely different, the incredible stress that is put under the mind of the characters  that undergo the transformations  that occur in the series leads to amazing an amazing character development, really worth of praise.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nInuyashiki\u00b4s story is one of the most unpredictable and genuinely fun to watch  stories that i've watched(in anime) for a long time. It is a joy to look forward to a new episode every week, wondering what surprising events will take place in the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis is an interesting story told masterfully, and I reccomend this to anyone that likes supernatural or sci-fi stories, regardless if you like Anime or not.",

From a pretty hazily laid out narrative that fails to deliver on the themes and questions it presents, to stale characters that are caricatures of what they're supposed to represent, Inuyashiki is a rather forgettable show that relies on shock and gore for dramatic effect as opposed to good storytelling and character development.\r\nArt: I could not stand the jarring transitions from hand-drawn scenes to the weird CGI effects. The hand-drawn frames were actually pretty well done, but half the time the characters are shown in weird blocky CG. What's more, in many'emotional' scenes you have these characters crying while looking like they're made of clay. Some might argue the scenes show the contrast between the machine nature of the characters at hand and the humanity they display. Sure, this was probably the\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There are 2-3 main characters in Inuyashiki, with 1 or 2 new focal ones thrown in halfway. All these characters are pretty immutable and stay relatively the same from start to finish. Shishigami is a psychopath from start to finish, with brief glimpses of humanity shining through that ultimately don't really do anything to add to his character; he's made out to be a guy who cares for his family and doesn't care for anyone else, and the show ends with him maintaining this perspective. Same goes for Inuyashiki: caring guy from start to finish. This would be fine, except it's clear the show wanted to pose questions dealing with the nature of humanity vs machine: which would triumph, which is superior, etc. The show only superficially deals with these questions with a pretty banal good vs evil story, afraid to affect its characters and have them actually deal with these questions on a personal level and perhaps change due to it. So in the end, we're left with cardboare cut-outs of the 'evil' guy, the 'good' guy and a pretty boring story of what they perceive 'humanity' to be. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a good psychological thriller, I don't recommend Inuyashiki. There is no depth or interesting delivery of the conflicts present in the show. It is a shallow good vs evil narrative that leaves no sense of closure because there's no other conflicts to be dealt with other than the one of the protagonist vs the antagonist. \\n\\n",

            "content": "A story of the best and worst of humanity...\r\nInuyashiki for LA for the Fall of 2017 was one of LA's most anticipated anime to come out and heck for LA, it delivered!\r\nThere were several things worrying LA for Inuyashiki. One is the entire dynamic of Inuyashiki (the character not the anime) and Shishigami's white and black morality hammering itself in that Inuyashiki is the hope to humanity while Shishigami is the worst of humanity and everything (and by extension more of the minor one-off characters being utter assholes or horrible humans beings) and yes, Inuyashiki goes a bit into this before Inuyashiki and Shishigami havetheir first confrontation. Second is the tone of this anime has mild moodswings bringing in comedic tone to a somewhat serious moment at times and lastly is the CGI.\\n\\n\r\nSo to defend LA's first point is that at least Inuyashiki does delve into the white and black morality and actually goes to show that Inuyashiki and Shishigami aren't completely the extreme's to their respective morality...in some sense. What does LA mean by this?, well the best example is Shishigami, does his hatred for humanity and his literal killer instincts come from his birth?...or did society change him into being this...or was it Shishigami himself?...it's never completely told to us and even with his first encounter with the dregs of humanity. Inuyashiki however only shows that his white morality is tested once Shishigami gets put into the picture. The second point to defend is that Inuyashiki (the anime) at least tries to calm us with several references to GANTZ, Hiroya Oka's other famous work and the author and artist of the original source material to Inuyashiki. Lastly the CGI to defend, it makes sense for LA at least. The CGI are used with Inuyashiki and Shishigami's robotic-ness and yeah that actually makes sense to their alien robotic technology being uncanny thus the CGI is pretty detailed all things given and even the animation isn't completely CGI just when Shishigami or Inuyashiki goes full robot this occurs.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by MAPPA, the animation as LA said earlier, the CGI is implemented very well, but the rest of the animation from the detailed character designs to the brilliantly done battles and uncensored gore and one, risky as hell and LA at least could tell the animation was great.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, was actually pretty great, from Fumiyo Kohinata voicing the elderly badass Inuyashiki to the stoically tranquil insanity of Nijirou Murakami as Shishigami as well as some great performances from Sumire Uesaka, Kanata Hongo and Sumire Morohoshi as Inuyashiki's (the character) daughter, Naoyuki Ando, Shishigami's \"friend\" and Shion Watanabe who's befriend's Shishigami respectively. The voice acting was great all round and visceral as hell..on speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki gave off LA several feelings to this anime, all very visceral. Now the visceral feelings goes from it's highs to lows, from Shishigami's stoic killing spree bringing terror to LA (no seriously, Shishigami is a terrifying villain if you put him into real life) to Inuyashiki's more bright moments showing us the ray of hope to contrast to Shishigami's.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki's ending might be \"pointless\" or \"anticlimactic\" to some people, however for LA, this was a nice bow to end this hectic plot of good vs. bad and once again shows us that Shishigami as the monster he is...he still has a bit of humanity left in him. LA will say this ending was well done and gave off a nice sendoff to this anime without (and hopefully) not bringing us the annoying \"read the manga\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki was one of LA's most anticipated anime for Fall 2017 and it delivered in all it's visceral and hectic \"showing the best and worst of humanity\" glory it did and easily became one of LA's favourites for Fall 2017. Inuyashiki just didn't fail for LA and even gave LA a VERY nice ending to go off on. \\n\\n\r\nLast Hero indeed...Inuyashiki.",

I won't give any spoilers buteven then you'd have guessed it without me telling you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very disappointing anime because it started with so much possibilities and potential.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Garbage, slow(without a proper reasoning to it), some parts were meaningless and repetitive, I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because of the promising start.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was alright, but nothing special and nothing worth remembering. I gave it 6/10 because there was at least some effort in the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Same as art, no surprises, very generic. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Absolute horror, most characters in this anime are borderline unrealistic and what they do is quite random. Okay maybe the dogs are alright. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There's very little to enjoy, probably only 1 thing which happened in the first episode, the transformation of a main character. 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10.",

Protagonist is the good guy and likes saving people. Antagonist is the bad guy and is a psychopath. I didn't realize this was an 11 episode series either. I figured there would be more and then out of nowherethe climatic battle between the two is over in a couple minutes. The battle was lacking as well. They both get knocked out, go into robo combat mode, and the protagonist just wins. We've been building up the assumption that the Antagonist is far more in control of his robotic body but then our MC doesn't have any trouble whatsoever contending and defeating him. Not a scratch on him.\\n\\n\r\nThis is enjoyable if I just turn my brain off. The technical details (up until the last battle anyway) have been pretty spot on. A nice use of CG animation, some pretty nice sound design, and the art is good. \\n\\n\r\nBut, the story and characters just can't get any more one dimensional than this. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall is a 5..\\n\\n\r\nOne episode to redeem this series' pitfalls is too little too late.",

After which things were never the same again for the two, but the plot here is not what bothwere capable of, but what they have done with their newly discovered abilities, one chooses to abuse his power by killing, stealing and causing mayhem , one chooses to help people instead. Ok so it's such things is always in those superhero shows, but it's the human side that how they see the world should be in their perspective that counts , since here, the evil one sees himself as a villain who is not after world domination but more like doing bad things in a way like a teenager would, which is to use his power as his plaything, in fact all the bad things he does were something like a teenager with some antisocial behavior would do. The good old man on the other hand was more of a responsible one, he sees the need to help since in was in his nature of being selfless a family man despite of the experiences he is having with his family, he is more like turning his frustration into doing something good. and that's is why this ain't no run of the mill. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI were great, there were some fanservices around here were we see a naked girl being abuse by a Yakuza big shot, but nothing malicious, especially when that baddie got what it deserve and don't expect any panty flashes with Mari and Shion. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound: \\n\\n\r\nwell, the voices were appropriate for the character's role I give studio MAPPA for that, I really like that the old man's tone, it was well suited to be this mild manner old man and Hiro's seiyuu who portrays well as an antisocial sinister guy. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo we have an oldman who can pass as Cyborg's grandpa, a teenager who could pass as spoiled kid that needs some spanking from the latter, but the ones making the impact here were not the two but the people whom they encounter, like the oldman beating the shit out of those toughies whom were planning to woop some guy's ass, the family who was mercilessly killed by Hiro, the lusty Yakuza Big Boos who got owned by the oldman, The bullies that were killed by Hiro. And Hiro friend Ando who become's the oldman's sidekick , Mari and Shion were the one who have given this anime it's body so basically it all relies on that. BANG!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nFrankly it's the anticipation of Hiro getting owned after his spree of mayhem and murder that was the focal point of my excitement, which it did happen. At first I was disappointed when the oldman did finish him totally, but it was nice that he redeem himself in the end. DADADADADADADADAAAAA!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nThe ending may be a bit pathetic, but it was good that studio MAPPA and creator Oku Hiroya didn't hesitate to kill both of them off, since the characters themselves would be better off being missed than fade off, also it was good that the anime only run for just 11 episode, better to have something good for a short time than something long that one would die from boredom. DADADADADADADADADADAAAAA!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas to all of you....\\n\\n\r\nBANG!!!!!!!          \\n\\n",

Nothing happening on the screen makes sense, and on top of it it's plagued with awful CGI. And when it's not it's just mediocre. So it's not even visually enjoyable. Artists couldn't even handle the basics of drawing (watch episode 10 and look how big airplanes are compared to everything else - literally 10 times bigger than IRL) such as proportions. \r\nWaste of time. I'd rather go rewatch rozario x vampire and OD on it's retarded plotline thanwatch this. This might actually be the worst anime I've ever seen. Nothing comes even close to this. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of 'this is bad' reviews that don't provide any actually arguments as to why this is bad, but it's enough to watch first two episodes to realize it's crap. I only watched all 11 episodes just in case it's actually not as bad as I thought.. well what do you know.",

I've only ever watched the anime, so I really hope the manga does a better job with how the story and characters pan out.\r\nThe show itself is visually pleasing, but that's the only thing this show has going for it. The characters lack depth, making every action seem contrived just for the sake of plot progression. Why is Shishigami the way he is? Why does that girl love Shishigami despite his actions? Every recurring character's motive for their actions, aside from Inuyashiki, is spotty and pathetic. \r\nDespite theart being one the show's only bright spots, the animation of the characters' facial expressions fail to match the emotion of the voice actors. Overall, you're left cringing when you see and hear the combined product of a character crying. Speaking of crying, you see a lot of it in this anime. However, since the characters lack any depth, it's tough to relate to their emotions. Everything about this anime is contrived.",

            "content": "Come one come all as we watch Elderly Robot Jesus plays killer laser tag with Teenage (also) Robot Terrorist\u2026 aka the story of Inuyashiki. Sounds like an exciting show right? Two machines of mass destruction face off against each other in a classic hero vs villain anime, really draws the audience\u2019s curiosity. Well too bad it\u2019s not as interesting as the synopsis makes it out to be. As much as I enjoyed the villain, the rest doesn\u2019t really hold up as well.\r\nSince the show\u2019s main priority is to build up the final fight between our main characters, let\u2019s talk about them first. Inuyashiki\u2026 is kindaboring. An old man who doesn\u2019t do much except for talk about how much he can\u2019t forgive bad people. Sure he wants to play the hero, but it\u2019s only really an excuse to find a purpose in his life. There is one episode where he becomes a little morally grey, but due to it only happening once and never being touched on again, it just feels like some weird superhero phase for him. Along with the same episode adding and disposing of new characters that no one cares for, it just felt really out of place.\\n\\n\r\nHiro, on the other hand, is a great character. They establish his reason for using his newfound powers for murder, and they allow you to see his inner justification for his despicable actions. Everything he does has its own consequences, resulting in the people he cares being targeted by society in a desperate attempt to bring him to justice. We watch as his view of the world turns from amusement to hatred, his emotions switching between joy and anguish, evolving from a somewhat playful serial killer to a one-man army. The sheer difference between the two MCs is so stark that I ended up cheering for Hiro as he shoots up everything remotely Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are pretty unimportant, with only a few other characters getting any real exploration. The others only get screen time for one of two reasons: 1. They\u2019re gonna get killed off or 2. They\u2019re gonna need to be saved. You can\u2019t really care about all these side characters knowing they serve no other purpose than to be plot devices. It also makes character deaths pretty predictable across the series\u2026 at least it would have been if it wasn\u2019t for the powers of Robot Jesus. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry guys, Inuyashiki and Hiro can basically bring people back from the dead, mend your bones and cure cancer just by holding their lifeless corpse for a few seconds, so most of the characters that die will spring back up again like nothing happened. Hurray for plot armour, thank you for ruining almost every character death scene. Thank you for making the drama basically hit or miss in the amount of impact they hold on the characters and the audience. Thanks a bloody lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show is riddled with various other problems. For a decent amount of the first half, the pacing is way too fast, trying to rush through the drama Inuyashiki or Hiro must face. You can\u2019t get a grip on the seriousness of the situation before it jumps into the next scene, leaving you completely unsatisfied. Fortunately, by the time it hits the second half, it has already managed to slow down, making it a much more enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the reactions from characters also seem to tone done the emotions the show is trying to portray. Characters are either too quick to grieve over everything or seemingly don\u2019t care about the horrible shit that\u2019s happening around them. People say that this was done on purpose to make our MCs feel more human than humanity itself, but it just doesn't work in its favour. There is no state of initial shock to help transition the character's emotions to what they should be, so the show succeeds at making it\u2019s characters feel fake and robotic. Which is kinda funny thinking when you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe the action of Inuyashiki, I would call most of it comical and a little ridiculous. An elderly man with no fighting experience bitch slapping enemies so hard that they end up spinning in mid-air or bouncing around the room, and a teenage boy finger gunning everyone to death by saying Bang and Ratatatat over and over\u2026 It just feels really silly most of the time. The show is trying to stay serious all the time but I just can\u2019t keep a straight face when I watch it. Sure there is also a fair share of really good action scenes, but even then I can\u2019t take them at face value without being reminded of the show\u2019s previous attempts. Adding in the Trump cameo and final arc, I don't know how anyone is supposed to watch this without either laughing out loud or getting a little pissed off.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the CG animation. My God, it does not look good most of the time. It\u2019s so out of place when it continuously switches between 2D and 3D. I get that it must take too much time to draw the intricate machine parts that make up our main characters, but it\u2019s just used way too often. Even the final battle has some CG explosions and they look atrocious. Compared to the beautiful Houseki no Kuni sharing the same airing season, it\u2019s such a major step-down.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve gone on long enough and it sounds like I hate the show, so let me make it clear. It really does have it\u2019s good moments when it focuses on Hiro making sense of how he should use his powers, so I can\u2019t give this anime a low score. I can only recommend this if you can enjoy a well-made villain, everything else leaves a lot to be desired.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki was a show I did not expect to be as good as it proved to be. It was created by Oku Hiroya who made Gantz and while I greatly enjoyed the action and violence in Gantz the story of it could have used some work. That wasn`t a problem for Inuyashiki though.\r\nStory:9/10\r\nThe story is simple,Inuyashiki finds out he has little left to live and goes to a park where something happens to him and when he wakes up he is suddenly a robot. He realizes that with his new body he can use his powers to help mankind. With his new body he canheal people and even cure incurable diseases. He can also stop criminals with the weapons built into his new body. The problem is that Inuyashiki did not know that in the park that day another person was there. Hiro Shishigami also gained the same powers as Inuyashiki on that day but he uses his powers to kill for fun or to just test the limits of his new body. The story lies in the clash between the two due to their differing morals. Without spoiling too much Hiro does have a change of heart eventually but is soon forced to go back to his old ways. It all climaxes in a grand battle between the two and a final episode full of feels. The story is pretty simple but effective at entertaining. You cheer for Inuyashiki and wince at some of the crueler Hiro scenes and even laugh at the ridiculous bang and dadadada shouts that the two use when firing their weapons. It is effective at showing two polar opposites and what they would do for the ones they love.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nThis was animated by MAPPA so it had good animation like all the other MAPPA anime I have seen. Some scenes have the characters in 3D but its not really a problem. You don`t have to worry about it being shit like Berserk 2016.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nThe music in this anime especially the opening were great. The opening had the hard hitting music that aims to pump you up before the show and it does just that. The visuals in it were also interesting and you couldn`t help but laugh a little when you see Inuyashikis face falling to Earth. The ending is calmer and it fits for some of the feels you might have after the conclusion of an episode especially when it plays during the finale. I can`t really say much for the BGM I didn`t really hear it often but that was more due to me being pulled into the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\nThe 2 main characters of the show Inuyashiki and Shishigami were good examples of what one might do had they actually acquired their powers. Naturally some might use their gift to help others but some might use it for evil. However Shishigami was not totally evil. You can see that throughout the show he truly cared for some people. The problem was that he couldn`t care less about people who weren`t his friends or family. Even though he goes on killing sprees you have to sympathize with him at times. When he goes through his change of heart you wish it could have lasted but by than it was too late to make up for what he had done. Shishigami was a well executed antagonist that did not feel too much like a one dimensional villain. While Shishigami has the looks of a character you`d find in many manga and light novels Inuyashiki was different. You wouldn`t expect to see an old man be the hero in a show like this but it works out. Inuyashiki always wanted a meaning in life and his new powers gave him just that. He was a truly kind human being and only wanted to help as many as he could. He felt like a real hero going around saving as many as he could and stopping Shishigami and I found myself cheering him on every week. Especially the finale will show how much of a hero he really was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nLike I said I wasn`t expecting this show to be this good yet I found myself enjoying it week after week. Both of the main characters have their great moments and while the two fight each other directly that many times throughout the show their grand battle was epic to watch. Besides the happy feelings you experience whenever Inuyashiki manages to save someone or the chills you feel when Shishigami murders an innocent kid there`s also moments where you can`t help but laugh. The whole bang and dadadada thing in the show become a funny meme. You also can`t forget the scene where Trump makes an appearance during the finale and that honestly made me lol for a couple minutes\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nThis is a show worth your time. It`s only 11 episodes so if you have around 4 hours it is definitely a worthwhile anime to watch and add to your list.",

            "content": "I have nothing to preface this with that the synopsis doesn't cover, so let's jump right into the review.\r\nStory - 5 - I came into this series with fairly high hopes, but those hopes were slowly but surely dashed over time. It's a story about good vs evil in their most pure forms with no depth to speak of.  It was an entertaining watch for a while, but the draw of a pure action series wears thin pretty quickly.\r\nArt -  8 - The series' visuals are strange for anime, but they work well. It goes for an almost hyperrealistic style that's unafraid tohave characters that look old or unattractive. This does unfortunately lead to a couple expressions that just look off, like they're conveying the wrong emotion, but they're few and far between. The decision to use CGI for characters at times was also strange, but it serves it's purpose and doesn't stand out too too much. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 - I feel like I have to say this in all my reviews, but I very rarely notice the quality of music, voice acting, or sound effects. No music in the series is coming to mind, so I'm not sure if it has much beyond ambience or cliche dramatic superhero music. The voice acting I thought was pretty excellent. It's not often screams and cries are accurately portrayed, and even as a non-Japanese speaker I could still pick up on some more nuanced emotions in casual conversations. Sound effects aren't especially good, but they do their job efficiently.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1 - Inuyashiki is your generic nice, passive nobody. Shishigami isn't generic, but he's incredibly boring considering he has no moral code or motivations. All non-main characters are stupid and unlikeable in how they respond to Shishigami's actions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4 - I will commend the technical effort required to make this series. However, I can't recommend it due to the writing quality. Despite only having two episodes left, this is not something I'll be completing.",

            "content": "This is my first review ever written, so if you have some suggestions for improvements, write me a private message pls :)\r\nI wrote this review for people who haven't seen this anime but are planning to do, so I tried to keep plot details, that don't appear in the synopsis of mal, to a bare minimum.\r\nWhen I first heard about Inuyashiki I was already sold. A Cyborg Grandpa fighting against a Cyborg Teenager!? Nice. Something that sounds so ridiculously awesome must come out of Japan. Adapting a Manga written and drawn by Hyroya Oku, who made Gantz, one of my favorite manga of all time!?Count me in. Knowing Oku I expected a lot of blood, action and tits out of this anime. And hey I got  two of them right. So lets \"talk\" about the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters:\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a simple good vs evil story.  Inuyashiki being the force of good and Hiro being the one of evil.  Old man Inuyashiki and teenager Hiro turn into cyborgs, Inuyashiki uses his powers to help and protect the innocent and weak, while Hiro uses his Powers to be an asshole. And these traits can be used to describe all characters in this show. Either they're are evil scumbags, jerks(like Inuyashikis family, for no reason) or the nicest people you've ever seen in your whole life. While premise and characters are very shallow, watching this series never gets boring, since every episode escalates further and further action wise. Some episodes try to give the characters more personality and depth. And while appreciated those where way to few and or shallow to make the characters stand out. The story doesn't take itself to seriously most of the time, which is again appreciated since action scenes and animation look great and are a joy to watch. However the scenes that do take themselves seriously are most of the time boring or cringe inducing. Worst thing about the story is the ending, it was way to rushed, not build up correctly and tried to have a sad conclusion, because... why not? In summary: Characters and story are lacking but still enjoyable enough to watch.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10\\n\r\nThe problem this anime faces is simple, the characters and story aren't good enough to be considered a great, fun action anime like TTGL for example. But it also doesn't take it self as serious as Elfenlied or Mirai Nikki to categorize it as an overly pretentious and edgy series. So if you just want to turn off your brain and enjoy some nice animated action scenes this anime was made for you.",

The art is wonderful and realistic, by which I mean the characters actually look Japanese. The 3D animated scenes can be a bit iffy, but compared to most 3D anime, it is good. \r\nThe whole series was an emotional rollercoaster, having you thrilled at one moment, sad at another, and then appalled at some points. But overall it gives off a sense of hope and salvation. \r\nI'll keep it short: If you're looking for an emotional series filled with action, crime, sci-fi, and great character development, I highly recommendthis.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reasons I give this an 8/10 are the iffy 3D moments (which are still better than most), and because the ending feels a bit rushed, like it should have been spanned over 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBut all-in-all, it's a great short series.

            "content": "The review will be in three parts. In the last part I will comment on the Fansub that I watched.\r\nA. Story, Character & Enjoyment\r\nWhat moved me the most in this beautiful philosophical thought provoking thriller was it's focus on Human ethics - what it mean's to be human and how this ethic transcends all subjectivity.\r\nLook at Mr. Inuyashiki. An old man who was shunned by his family, ignored by them despite all the struggles he went through for them. When he wanted his family's support the most and wanted their sympathy and love, they just acted as if he never existed. This heart-tearing moments arethe defining points for this series. I don't want to spoil the story for you, but this very man was then gifted with all the powers and this made him more humane.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more understood and appreciated with the contrasting of the other main character - Shishigami Hiro, a high school kid. Mr. Inuyashiki (58) and Hiro represent the two sides of the human nature. Mr. Inuyashiki personifies the the innate good and morality that defines the human greatness as a species, whereas Hiro represents the dark side of the same human being that thrives on hate and selfishness.\\n\\n\r\nI like these animes where the philosophical questions of ethics and life are asked in such unique ways that compels the viewer to think hard and seriously. It puts the viewer in the position of a judge and lets him decide how he should behave in such defining moments of human life.\\n\\n\r\nFor example - we all want to be on the side of good. But, there ARE times when our emotion of vengeance and hatred gets the better of us. Throughout the series you will find yourself siding with Shishigami Hiro and even cheer him. That's because he isn't something that is outside of the human nature. Rather, what he represents IS part of our very nature that we must strive hard to overcome. Although we may fail at times, we should not give up and try our best till the end because there WILL come a chance when you can repent for the bad things you have done.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a series where at regular intervals you will see the world in a very different way and have to decide which path you will take. I know it's the characters in the story that are doing all the things. But, the story and the characters are so engaging that you won't be able to separate yourself from the world portrayed in the series. It sucks you in and makes you a part of that world. This is for me what makes me want to keep on watching good animes.\\n\\n\r\nDon't bother with the low ratings. Most the people who rated this series low just don't have the taste to think deeply, philosophically. You won't get the taste unless you try. You have to stop for a moment, close your eyes, put yourself on the shoes of these characters. A good story makes this easier for you. It doesn't let you get distracted or bored.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe art is overall good, but at times the movements 3D models seem to robotic. I guess this is unavoidable when using 3D models. You can't cut yourself any slack and that's not always possible. Character designs where good also. I like the way they drew the girls, they were very beautiful and pleasure to the eye. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music and sound, GOD it was a mind-blower. The OP was supreme!!! I became a fan of \"Man with a mission\" rock band just after this one song. HIT ME ON THE GROUND! HIT ME ON THE GROUND! The ED was great, the sounds were great overall. I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I highly recommend this anime. It is a very good one if you want to someone to animes. It's concise and to the point. Every moment is enjoyable. It's thrilling, it will keep you on the role until you finish it.\\n\\n\r\nFANSUBS:\\n\\n\r\nI watched MTBB's subs. The translations were improvised at many places for the good. Their video quality was good. The only problem I had was that the lyrics got stuck during the OP while using MPC-HC. But, I have to say the way they designed the subs during the OP was pro class. I'm talking about the fonts they used and how the words seemed to be dancing with the beat. Man! I think the subs were creating some pressure to the MPC-HC as it kept getting stuck, so I switched to VLC player. But in VLC it had another problem in other places. I mean sub translation of sentences in the pictures kept bouncing - I mean the sub. This didn't happen in MPC-HC. But if ignored these two things, then the sub was superb, specially because they translated many pictures where you wouldn't under the story without understanding them and they put the translation with such care that they seem part of the original video. I would recommend this fansub if asked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a great experience. I thank the director, the producer and all the staff for this wonderful anime.",

            "content": "Review #6: Inuyashiki\r\nStory 9/10 -- Inuyashiki is one of the best anime series I have seen in a long time. What I find exceptional is its sinister dark humor, and jaw dropping action sequences. The antagonist in this series seems like an evil genius on the verge of breaking down and I love it. The protagonist is an old man, who is greatly weakened and unloved, possibly an allegory to religion and god himself today. I believe there is more to this show then just a simple fight between good and evil. This show questions the basic forms of humanity we have, it shows depthwhen we break down and seek forgiveness, and it also shows how humanity can never move on from what we do wrong rather then right. There isn't enough anime with deep psychology, and arbitrary decisions that mock societies basic rules of function.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 -- Art was the worst category in this series. I am not a CG fan, but when I do see it I always notice some weird scenes or flaws that make me like it less. There was definitely some weird CG sequences, usually during the flying phases, that was a turnoff from this very good anime. I would also say that the coloring seemed kinda bland in the background, lack of bright colors in most landscapes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 -- I think the OP was a strong contender this year, for top 10 anyways. The ED was also pretty good, and it was opposite of its rock counterpart. I think it was a good selection because theres always moments to process what is done, and the ED is a good choice to acknowledge feelings of guilt and humanity Hiro starts to feel as well as Ichirou. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 -- In the beginning it felt like it was God vs Evil, but then it developed more after that. Even though the old man saves many people through the course of this show, He is also not afraid to punish the wicked, and reverse tragic fate by using higher means. Hiro finds the value in humanity through his mother, who was the stepping stone to his awakening. I think what Hiro was missing most was the social relationships that all humans strive for. It is very hard to live alone, most people often find themselves struggling with mentality when they feel everything must be done alone. Hiro uses his mothers wishes and applies them to himself. He may not understand the value of others around him, but his mother seems to and he attaches himself to her feelings. The old man believes that humans have a right to live there lives in peace, and find a place where they can, I believe that's why he is seen as God, because he continues that tradition that humans perform there best when they can control the situation around them. The characters may not connect with other viewers in the same way, but I believe it would be ridiculous to say that they lack any sense of depth or characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 -- Psychological, Sci-fi, and Drama always usually mash up to create a good adapted anime. Inuyashiki to me was an above average adaptation in a season and a year that was essentially lacking in good adapted titles. I enjoyed watching this series for every episode, as it kept me on my toes, and I wondered what would happen next to the people and the characters. The vigilante behavior Hiro awakens into quickly turns into something more malicious, but I wouldn't say it wasn't deserved in some cases. I think Inuyashiki was a great example of how people say things so freely, because they never expect consequences behind it. As unrealistic as it may be, it was definitely a heart pounding wake-up call that I enjoyed watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 -- Inuyashiki was one of my personal favorites of 2017, It just shattered my expectations of what a drama could do, and I thought it was almost as good as Steins Gate, but was a bit more mature in its storyline. I would strongly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi and anime with psychology, I would also recommend the manga to anyone seeking a story with literary devices. I would say the series deserves a score between 8.5 and 8.75, but due to lack of good titles in 2017, I have rounded it up to a 9, also partly influenced by its satirical, but iconic twisted storyline.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

            "content": "Dropped at EP4.  Some spoilers.\r\nSo I really thought I was going to like this anime.  The concept is really cool and the MC is quite original.  When the plot starts moving in EP1 I was immediately hooked, and just adored the overall plot concept.  It was enough that I ignored my nagging inclinations about the bad side of this show until I was at EP4, where I couldn't do so anymore.\r\nThe problem is that this show is basically constant torture-porn.  The author seems to only care about trying to inflict as much psychological damage on the audience as possible, andusing that to make his villains seem worse than normal villains.  In the first episode it seems like it might be a one-off thing, but by EP4 it's apparent this is just going to be a cliche Gantz \"Everyone's Evil\" world.  Expect anyone who is not the MC to either actively kill people or not care if people get killed.  It's a completely misanthropic style of writing that doesn't impart any kind of realism to the story despite that being the intent of the author.  It doesn't appeal to me to see eleven episodes of people getting drugged, raped, tortured, and painfully killed.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that the concept could float entirely on its own.  Like so many hyper-violent anime, the plot concepts are strong and could have been used to make a really good story, but instead the authors just want to write the anime equivalent of edgy teenage murder fantasies.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone, it's entirely garbage and I regret the time I spent with it.",

I found my self enjoying the story and it was very well develop. The art is pretty trashy tho and the animation sometimes look weird. The fighting scenes are pretty well done and the different part of the story lets you know better the characters. this a pretty good series thatmade me cry and hang at the end of my seat until the very last moment. I would only wish that we had more insight at the very beginning for the purpose of why it happened to them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think you should watch this anime if you enjoy fighting style anime with psychological themes, but bearable with the animation. \\n\\n\r\n:: \u02d3(\u144a\u1629\u144a\u204e) ::",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a sci-fi anime series that adapts a manga with the same name, which was written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku; who is also the original creator of Gantz. The anime focuses on the two individuals: Shishigami Hiro and Inuyashiki Ichirou. Although, very different, the two gained the same powers, with which they are now able to not only destroy Japan but also the whole world. The question; however, is that how these two are going to use these super powers? \r\nAnyway, Inuyashiki is, indeed, a better version of Gantz. Yet, if you have never heard of Gantz, or if you do not wantto watch this anime only because of the fact that Gantz was too much for you, do not jump to any unnecessary conclusions yet. As a fan of Gantz there is a 90% chance that you will highly appreciate this series, because sometimes Inuyashiki is just too realistic, but later about that. For those who have never heard of Gantz, you are in a better position. I do not have to explain you anything.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki Ichirou is a living embodiment of misfortune: he is only 58 years old, but he looks like he is actually 70 something years old. He earns money for his family and tries not to be a burden for his family, at the same time his family sees him only as a source of money. In addition to this, the main protagonist of the series finds out that he has cancer at an incurable stage. Having heard the news, Ichirou heads back home to explain the whole situation to his family and when he is about to engage in this rather tragic conversation with his family, he understands that his family does not care. Can it even become worse now? And the answer is yes. Ichirou goes for a walk with his only true friend, his dog. Being in the position where no one actually cares about you, the man speaks with his fluffy buddy, which is the only living being that he can talk to. Suddenly, Inuyashiki Ichirou notices a young man standing nearby. A strong blinding light in the night sky strikes the earth where Ichirou and the young man stand. He later wakes up to find out that he is no longer ill and that his body is now something that can either save, or destroy the world. How the new superhero is going to use that power? And what is he now? \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Hiroya Oku sensei, I am sure that you will give this series a try. The main thing I have to say is that this show is very similar to Gantz, but at the same time they both are very different. Inuyashiki is a more realistic series that focuses on the life of the real human beings: their personalities, their fears, and desires are all realistic. Of course, Inuyashiki focuses on science fiction, but at the same time it is something that might be real in 20 something years. However, if you have no idea what Gantz is, or if you are a big hater of this title, I highly recommend you to give Inuyashiki a shot: it is a mature superhero story that has a nice Texhnolyze, Gungrave, Serial Experiments Lain and Ergo Proxy vibe to it. Though, the story does not give a comprehensible explanation on the nature of the superpowers, it still offers the viewer superb story development. Note: the show does explain it, but does it indirectly; I am not going to do the thinkings for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, you should definitely find the biggest TV in your apartment and watch this series on it; that is what I did. The animation is simply splendid. Only after watching the opening you want to watch more and more of it; it is too realistic sometimes. Character designs, background, and action scenes are amazing, too. The only problem; however, is that the anime sometimes uses the Berserk (2016)-like CGI that hurts your eyes. But it is not a bid deal, since it is only used for unnecessary scenes. Sound wise, the anime has some good opening and ending themes, as well as a nice OST. The bad thing; however, is that there should have been more tracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters wise, it is where the show truly shines. Shishigami Hiro is the exact antithesis of Inuyashiki Ichirou. Though, their fate is quite similar, they are two very different individuals that have different understanding of how they are supposed to use their superpower. The two protagonists receive the same amount of development, which will help you to better understand their characters, their actions, and what is important for them. The supporting cast; however, could have received a better development, but it is also not that important, since they are not the main focus of this series. \\n\\n\r\nCriticism. First, it is way too predictable. Sometimes it is just too obvious to predict what is about to happen. Not most of the times, but sometimes you just want a show to be more unpredictable. Second, it is too realistic and sometimes too emotional. The author complements the author of One Piece in his show and perhaps Hiroya Oku wanted to make his anime somewhat similar to One Piece in its depiction of emotions. It is also sometimes too disturbing: rape, drugs, and deaths following one after another, so it might be a problem for those who are too sensitive, and it is definitely not a show to watch with your younger brother, or sister. However, if you are a fan of a more mature content: an awesome drama with some superb sci-fi elements, I am sure that this show will not leave you unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) \\n\r\nThat said, not flawless, but still a very enjoyable show. If you believe that you are mature viewer, I guess that you will find this show enjoyable. It does have a very slow start, but when you realize that you are watching the final episode, you just do not want it to end. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot, there is also Donald Trump.",

This is probably one of my favorite animes of all time now, in the short 11 episodes it had it really sucked me in to the story. I'm kinda sad it had to end the way that it did, but it was still a solid ending to an excellent show. The voice acting, facial expressions, and the depth of every character made me feel so immersed in this series. I also loved Inuyashiki as a character too, and his interactions made me feel so much for him. Inuyashiki was such an excellent show and Iam glad that I watched it! A true masterpiece, in my opinion!",

            "content": "Inuyashiki Review\r\nStory (6/10) Fine\r\nThe story for Inuyashiki was obviously one of those stories from the get go (especially if you knew how many episodes the anime was scheduled for) was not going to explain a lot of conspiracies and mysteries of their universe. That being said the what the series decided to focus on was nonetheless compelling from the end of episode 2 to the end of the anime.\r\nWith the amount of episodes it had if it did try to explain all of our questions it would probably have felt rushed so even though I'm going to wish I knew the answers to my questionsfor the betterment of pacing I can understand why it was not touched upon to it's full conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for this anime is very good, but that's about as much as you can say about it. The CG portions were not horrendous but they did stand out like a zit on your force from time to time. Nonetheless I wasn't too bothered by the CG enough to have to say anything else bad about it beyond that and like I said the hand drawn art style is about 75% of the anime and it's really gorgeous so I'll give it it's props there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki didn't have too many sound effects or moments that blew my mind when it came to sound but you would have no taste in culture to even consider skipping that opening by Man with a Mission, the ending music was a soothing conclusion to what most of the time was an end of an episode left you saying to your self \"geez that episode was lowkey stressful to watch.. at least the outro music can calm me down a bit.\" You can definitely feel the impact of the outro music also on the episode finale too. The voice acting was spot on for all character (JP VA) no one felt like that voice didn't fit them and the sound effects on the mechanical morphing of their bodies was pretty unique also. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Inuyashiki were very good, majority of the ones that were focused on definitely got a decent amount of time to be fleshed out, understood and become relatable to some degree depending on how you are. The villain Hiro's personality on the other hand is kind of hard to grasp when it came to being realistic as far as the quick character change he had once he became a what he became. Other than that I barely had any issues with and of the characters and how they were introduced and handled for the 11 episodes that they had.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 was the only episode that one could debate isn't that compelling which sucks because most of the time this could be considered one of the if not the most important episode of any anime as first impressions are important in getting a grasp on your audience. But by the end of episode 2 this anime exceeded what little expectations I had for it. I was there every thursday ready to \"Hit me on the ground\" and watch that week's episode and it did not disappoint for it's entire run. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I want to give it something more than just an 8.00/10. I want to stay as critical as possible for everything this anime brought to the table in 11 episodes. It's a very good anime but obviously not flawless to me in any one specific category. Nonetheless if you asked me while this was airing what you should be watching as far as anime I would have cut you off before you got the end of that sentence and said \"Inuyashiki fuck everything else airing right now\". I have not read or watch by the mangaka of this series but I intended to read Gantz in the future and heard it's quite a brutal series. I heard it's far more brutal than this is and if that's the case I can't wait but it was good advertising for Gantz since it was present a lot in this anime I liked that. Inuyashiki is a very good anime and you should watch it if you haven't but don't decide on dropping it until you reach the end of episode 2 if I had to tell you one thing.\\n\\n",

Its sometimes really bizarre and funny at some serious times. This is some of the psychological, sci-fi i really loved most. I will not forget these series that made my 2017 better just by watching till the end. I don't like the fans that are scoring this anime with less points but what can i do that's their own taste of watching and living. Besides let me state this anime without spoiler in details.\r\nStory-Well, well where should i start explaining the story. In simple the story starts with the old man which is living his life with regret and hate. He lives his life that a cockroach that is hidden inside a hole of the wall. Then he saw a light which is glowing and starts to follow it.And then the real beginning starts. i can tell this much if i continue afterwards i may be caught by spoiling it. For me it was an amazing thing i have even seen in 2017 then another thing that exist. I really love the pacing of the story, how it follows the correct scene of correct time. It was a good action series, so i give this story 10 points.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\n     There is one thing of animation that bugged me a lot and that was the CGI animation. I loved the animation sometimes and sometimes it was put irregularly, but still the animation made me hyped till the end. Maybe it was about budget that the animation doesn't get fixed but anyways i loved it after all. I give art 8 points.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\n          Well guess what? HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND just  HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND  HIT ME ON THE GROUND. Oh my god the opening scene is what brought me to watch this anime. I loved the opening of this anime and i really love to see all the channels or forum openings award 2017 to give the 1st price for this anime opening. i really wanna thank Man with a mission to show us the legendary song that they created.On the other hand  about ending song. The feels of the lyrics and so beautifully created the animation of both ending and opening song. The voice actors have done a really great job for voice acting the best characters and it was really suitable on them. i give the sound 9 points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\n                Whoa! about characters nothing to say best of them all. All the dialogues, quotes, speech, actions and emotions were at their best. i give this category 10 points. Overpowered characters!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\n                I really waited for every week for the upcoming episode and its sad that i will not get another episode of it. I really enjoyed and cried till the end. The series is covered with so many emotions that i can't even count. Thanks for the really blessed work Oku Hiroya the original creator of this anime and especially manga. You made my day better and i will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you guys to start watching this anime till the end no brakes allowed and i assume you will enjoy till the end. I would love to see it from the beginning again.Thank you for reading this and have a nice day like me!",

            "content": "The main reason that I started to watch \u201cInuyashiki\u201d is simple, I basically watch everything that studio MAPPA is serving up this days. Their style of art and animation catches the eye, with their manner of capturing the atmosphere and specific style of the show they produce. So, whatever you like the actual show or not, the visuals are seldom a disappointment. Which certainly are the case with \u201cInuyashiki\u201d as well. Studio MAPPA once again prove that they can be innovative, when it comes to art and animation choices for individual shows. I will get in more detail about their approach on \u201cInuyashiki\u201d later on.So, in the art and animation category \u201cInuyashiki\u201d get top score, but what about the rest? \\n\\n\r\nThe main theme is pretty basic and simple in its form, good vs evil. And now we talk about the classical approach on good vs evil. The good guy is the saviour, the real hero, who saves anyone he can, and are on a mission to stop evil. And the evil guy is the destroyer, the villain who kills, steals and makes havoc, just because he can, with no feeling of mercy or remorse. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s a bit more complicated than that, of course. The first episode kicks off with them, by coincidence, being in a park late at night, when a strong light hits them. When they wake up, they have no longer human bodies, but are now instead super advanced machines with their soul/consciousness intact. They tackle this fact in very different ways, Inuyashiki uses it to save people to still feel human, whilst Shishigami uses it to kill people to feel alive. \\n\\n\r\nSo far that is a very classical approach on \u201cgood vs evil\u201d. But in the way of how this is handled, \u201cInuyashiki\u201d does something different. The hero is an older unattractive man (in his late 50\u00b4s) named Ichirou Inuyashiki, who up until this point in life has been rather meek, passive, and quiet. Ichirou\u00b4s own family has no respect or regard for him, people boss him around, and he can\u00b4t do anything about the injustice he witnesses because he\u00b4s weak, both mentally and physically. The last drop for Ichirou is when he gets diagnosed with long gone lung cancer, and think that nobody will care if he dies. But all that change, when he gets his mechanical super body. He can now do something about the injustice around him, save sick people, and \u201clive\u201d with a purpose. His character was a fresh breath of air in the \u201cknown-character\u201d department if nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nThe villain reminds me a lot of the famous antagonist Light Yagami from \u201cDeath Note\u201d. Hiro Shishigami is young (17), very attractive, smart, lack completely any grain of empathy, and are the embodiment of what we call a psychopath. As long he is human, these traits stay in check, and he lives a normal high school life. But when he changes in to a machine, its like all dam\u2019s breaks, and he lets loose what always been inside him, but now no one can interfere with him \u2013 at least that is what he thinks. Shishigami are not completely without feelings doe, which actually makes the whole situation worse.\\n\\n\r\nI can see why the term \u201ctorture porn\u201d have been used describing the story and characters of \u201cInuyashiki\u201d. Some of humanities most ugly and disgusting sides are portrayed very explicit, both story wise and visually wise. Bulling, rape, senseless violence, miss use of power, the lack of empathy, shallowness, are all concepts \u201cInuyashiki\u201d brings up and treats according to reality, but as you can guess, for effect, been exaggerated a bit. At the same time, it portrays the victims side very detailed as well, the helplessness, the fear, the frustration of being powerless, the anger, and the shame of not being able to do what\u2019s right, or protect yourself or someone you care about. It isn\u00b4t pretty, so weak stomached should proceed with caution, there are some real intense scenes displaying what I mentioned above. I personally thought this take on a hero story was very refreshing and interesting, washed clean from the filter so often used in this type stories, due to that the reality is too filthy and ugly to look at. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the art and animation are as good as always when delivered by studio MAPPA. It isn\u00b4t perfect, but it got feeling. Some of their strength lays in that they are good at display details in a scene, and by so making it feel more authentic. You know the expression that it\u00b4s the details that makes up a painting? This goes for pretty much everything MAPPA does. Like the twisted face of some one crying, with tears and snot streaming down their face, the gleam of fear, anger or glee in someone\u00b4s eyes, or the impact a bullet, punch or explosion leave in it\u00b4s wake. \\n\\n\r\nIt could be good to know, that a lot of 3DCG are used. I personally think that it works really well with the concept of \u201cInuyashiki\u201d. It highlights the Sci-Fi touch, and give the scenes a fitting vibe, such as a scene there someone hurls through the sky in a city, with massive buildings zapping by, the angle constantly shifting. It was actually quite intense.  \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are always coherent, detailed and nicely coloured, with the night silhouette of the city being gorgeous. The character designs have less of an \u201canime\u201d touch to them, with favouring smaller eyes, more real lifelike Japanese features, and normal proportionate bodies. Which also highlights the more authentic feeling to the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, there are these little extra sound effects. Like the slobby sound of someone sniffle when crying, or the intense clank of something hitting metal, or the rush of air when something rushes by in the sky. The VA\u00b4s (Japanese), are nicely paired up with their character. Like the cold and devoid voice of Shishigami, the kind and unsure voice of Inuyashiki, or the condescending voice of Mari.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum things up, \u201cInuyashiki\u201d were an intense ride. I started to watch the show due to the studio producing it, and finished because of the twisted story. And of course, one of the large \u201cenjoy\u201d factors were studio MAPPA\u00b4s art and animation. I will follow them closely in the future, since they been very active this past year with show like \u201cKakegurui\u201d, \u201cShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul\u201d and \u201cGaro: Vanishing Line\u201d, which all have left an impression on me, good or bad. \\n",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a story that stands out with a fine premise to build on, with an interesting choice of an older main character that is sure to spark most people's curiosity. It is also a series that doesn't hold back on its R-rated content, going into places I've personally never seen any other anime go before. For that alone I can say I don't regret watching it.\r\nIf we were to discuss the actual quality of the show though... I can't excuse some astonishingly weird or straight-up horrible decisions on the author's part. This is a shame, since it's a show where the animation barely managesto be decent, plus the music and sound-design are fine yet nothing too exciting; meaning the story and characters are what you'd recommend the show for.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a setup of two main characters that both get extraordinary powers, yet end up using them in opposing ways. (The rules and limits of these powers are not established too well, though that's the least of the story's problems.) Our hero Inuyashiki finds meaning in helping others, while Shishigami only feels alive when abusing his powers. There's a straight-forward superhero vs. supervillain story there, with the potential to go deeper into what heroism and morality mean to the characters. The age-gap between the two could've also been used to examine the good and bad parts about their respective generations. Or, it could have been a story about the lengths people go to in order to feel alive. Sadly, it doesn't explore any of these themes in all too meaningful a way.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off, the story does a good job of getting you invested in seeing these two extremes clash, but wastes that potential when focusing almost only on the villain and his escalating madness through the second act, leaving Inuyashiki to sulk and barely have any great moments until the final showdown. Which brings me to the ending. A whole new element is brought in that has nothing to do with the core conflict, a convenient event out of nowhere that brings us to the most predictable outcome imaginable. Had they stuck with the main story and not brought in this last event to tie things together, I\u2019d have respected the show for at least trying its best.\\n\\n\r\nSumming it up, Inuyashiki will give you one third of an interesting superhero story, then two thirds that go off the rails like a trainwreck, crashing and burning under the weight of its own edginess. Only recommended to those with morbid curiosity who want to see something a bit different.",

            "content": "**WARNING! This review contains spoilers!**\r\nNow that the show is over, I am updating my previous review by cutting off the first part of it, as it isn't valid anymore. A quick tl;dr for you all: good premise, bad story, bad characters, alright animation and alright soundtrack, horrible ending.\r\nI love the premise of this series, I really do. But the mangaka handled it really, REALLY poorly. What presents itself as the touching story of the emotive development of an old, broken man turns into a random, stale gore fest with an atrocious ending. Indeed, this might have the worst ending ever conceived. Not to mention everycharacter that is not Inuyashiki is underdeveloped, uninteresting and bland. I shall dedicate a paragraph to discussing the characters.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is easily the best character in this and the only one I could ever like in here. But the problem is... we don't see much of him in the entire story! After a while, the antagonist, Hiro Shishigami, takes over as the \"protagonist\" and the person of Inuyashiki just doesn't grow anymore. We'll see random bits of him here and there, but nothing memorable or that expands his personality. To you anime only people who don't mind spoilers and are currently reading this, don't expect any further character growth for him unless they drastically change the story. On the other hand, Shishigami arguably gets even more screen time than the protagonist (!) but it just doesn't go anywhere! We don't get to know why he's a cruel, tasteless, merciless idiot and right till the very end of the manga we just see him kill more, and more, and more, AND MORE people. That's it. He just kills people and Inuyashiki does nothing about it. The other characters of this series are completely forgettable, in fact I don't know the names of any of them. The only memorable mention is that girl that for no reason falls in love with Shishigami, and he decides to not kill her for no reason as well.\\n\\n\r\n\"No reason\". Get used with this expression, because everything in the latter stages of the series happens for... no reason! Shishigami randomly kills a lot of people, Inuyashiki doesn't do anything about it, and eventually they fight. The fight is cool... but it too doesn't go anywhere. It was useless, yes. And after that fight... Donald Trump announces that the Earth will be destroyed by a meteor, society collapses, Inuyashiki decides to sacrifice himself to stop the meteor but Shishigami shows up, sacrifices himself STILL for no reason; it's not enough so Inuyashiki dies as well to protect the Earth, the meteor explodes, all are happy and merry. The end. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this happens so suddenly, for no reason (!) in the last volume, after all that useless carnage done by Shishigami. Such a tremendous way to end a series, to say the least. And that's it really, what could have been a great work just ends up being bad in almost every regard.\\n\\n\r\nFULL SCORES:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "Inuyashiki was quite the interesting anime. The story itself isn't anything special, it's the usual robot action that's all too common, however, the anime does tug at the heart strings just a tiny bit. Our main MC, Inuyashiki is someone who is underappreciated by his family and everyone to the point where even his daughter doesn't seem to acknowledge his presence. That obviously changes when a certain event takes place and so Inuyashiki is reborn.\r\nThere's a bit of CGI in this anime and it does stand out a bit but it shouldn't detract from the enjoyment of the show. The fighting scenes are well doneand overall, the pacing isn't too bad either. It has a bit of gore as well, not too heavy though. The whole self discovery was done at a fair pace as well. The show could've used more episodes to flesh out some of the characters and their backgrounds and to provide more opportunities for our main characters to interact with each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe show painted the whole situation as black and white and in some cases, it was but there were definitely some grey areas. The sound wasn't anything special, it fit well with what was going on. Both OP and ED were pretty well done and were well received by most of the viewers. Suffice to say, if you're looking for an action show with robots that makes you a bit emotional and don't mind the CGI, this is the show for you.",

A passion for someone so strong that you would give your life for them.\r\nInuyashiki had his son, wife, and daughter.\r\nShishigami had his girlfriend, his mom, and his friend.\r\n10/10 \r\nIt develops the characters and story with all of these possible multiple love stories.\r\nArt.\r\nThe art was veryunique and some of the best 3D CGI I have seen. It fits really well that I don't think a 2D would be able to do. However, some CGI scenes are more than lackluster.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nA memorable OP, soundtrack, and ending.

Some sound mixing along with other language voice actors did lack, however.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters develop as they rapidly get pushed to insanity, and then get grounded back to reality and take a step back. They realize how life is beautiful only cause there is death within it. I can relate to almost all of them, that could be due my emotional complexity, or due to the perfect script writing. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\r\nI loved this show, the action, characters, story, and art was all good.

            "content": "I should warn you that this review has harsh language but this anime has content more extreme than any cuss word I can think of so with that in mind.\r\nWith that out of the way we'll begin with a brief synopses of the plot\r\nInuyashiki is a pathetic old man with cancer and no friends. Realizing that his family doesn't love him and his only true companion in life is a dog that he kidnapped off the street, He decides to run through the park crying like a bitch. Where plot happens and he along with someone else is transformed into one of the most disgustinglyinept super hero's in existence. \\n\\n\r\nLater on we get introduced to Shishigami who's basically the polar opposite of Inuyshiki. Instead of having being a kind-hearted old man who enjoys helping people Shishigami is a self-centered god damn millennial that revels in destruction and jacks off to one piece hentai. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime centers around the drastically different ideologies Of both characters despite how simplistic their moral systems are both characters contrast one another nicely and neither of the characters come off as cartoonish. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the godawful animation of this show doesn't make your eyes roll out of your skull and pray for death then you should still avoid this anime at all cost. as the only characters that actully exist in the show can be summed up in a few words. Self centered pyscopath, And selfless old man. Really there's not much to say about the plot. One of the main characters goes on a gta style killing spree the old man stops him then the anime ends. No one important dies. It's just 9 episodes of watching some idiot robot running around shooting people. And since maffy is dead set on making sure I tell you why I dislike this anime < Even though that's not the purpose of a review. I'll fucking tell you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the main characters are fucking boring and their motivations are shit. Allow me to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\n Old man wants to help people and cure cancer because he's a good person < He has literally no motivations to do anything other than the fact that he's a good person and I feel like I shouldn't have to explain why that makes for a boring character but I feel like maffy is going to come down on me about it regardless. \\n\\n\r\nHe is never shown in any light that betrays his image as an incorruptible force of good. < Which is bullshit because no human being is like that. In short I dislike him because he can A: Do whatever the plot wants him to and B: is written like he has no faults aside from his age.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy life is a teenage robot is somehow even more shallow than the old man. He decides to kill people because fuck it why not. That's basically his entire character He's a generic one note sociopath with nothing unique about him. Which would be fine if he didn't say everything in an emotionless tone which makes him less disturbing and more robotic stagnant   \\n\\n\r\nBut lets get to the root of the problem aka the reason why I want to punch the creator in his smug hack face.\\n\\n\r\nThe main conflict centers around Robot boy with down syndrome running around the city murdering people in cold blood. And for all the characterization that his victims get. He might as well be shooting birds in his backyard with a sniper rifle like the inbred no classed, one note, fuckwit of a character he is. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow since maffy for some unknown reason has it out for me I've decided to dumb down this section of the review and go over what I mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\r\n1: The main characters are bad because they don't get enough characterization to flesh them out as individuals and they have no real arc despite there being the illusion of one. Teenage robot learns to care about people other than his mother but its hamfisted because they hardly spend any time bonding. And then after they have to leave for plot related reasons he devolves into his previous kill everything personality.\\n\\n\r\n2: The animation is bad, normally it'll be a mixture of cg and traditional just like beserk the transitions between the two are about as subtle as watching a rhino plow a human being. Objects that shouldn't pop out more than the main characters. Over the top expressions ruin the impacts of scenes I could go on but this review is already too god damn long.\\n\\n\r\n3:The plot is shallow and repetitive. After the initial shock of watching the protagonist gun down a man and his child we proceed to see the same mind numbing killing sprees over, and over again while the antagonist fights crime and cancer. < That's literally all that do.  \\n\\n\r\n4: Gary stue: Each of the characters have a slue of abilities that don't make any sense and get written off by the excuse that they're war machines. Never is it explained how teenage robot can shoot people through their computers, nor is it explained how they can raise the dead. They're just able to do these things and conveniently forget about their abilities when the plot needs someone to die. Since the old man can wireless  interface with every electric on earth instantaneously why didn't he just shut off the cities power grid until he caught robot boy? \\n\\n\r\n5: The music is nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\n6: Characters lack any motavation to do anything.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these were points I mentioned ^ I went in depth about them so this review wouldn't get removed. But knowing how effective the mods are they'll likely consider it a rant  even though I've made several valid points and listed in great detail why I dislike this anime, why you shouldn't watch it, and why it isn't anywhere near as deep as people say it is. But god forbid someone make a slightly uncouth review this anime? Obviously a misunderstood masterpiece in the eyes of troglodytes that can only be reviewed by those of a sound mind and body.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is something that I stumbled upon years ago when looking for a new series to read. I saw the cover art of the first volume and thought \"this looks weird, let's give it a shot.\"\r\nI'm glad I read it. It's a good story about an old man who finally finds purpose, after dying and being reconstructed into an android by mysterious alien lifeforms.\r\nI was very skeptical when the anime was announced. I'm not usually a fan of CG in anime and after the trainwrecks that were the two series of the recent adaption of Berserk, you can probably see why I was unsure aboutthis. However, my worries were unwarranted. The CG is only used sparingly for the most part, for scenes when Inuyashiki or Hiro are flying about or engaged in battle. While I think it does degrade slightly as the series goes on, it's not as bad as some other series I've watched.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off great. An old man gets turned into an android after an accidental death thanks to some joyriding alien lifeforms. It shows him coming to terms with it, discovering what he is capable of and finally embracing it. I really like Inuyashiki as a character because he's an emotional wreck. Simple things like saving someone will cause him to break down into tears of happiness. I'm really not sure why I enjoyed this so much but that's besides the point.\\n\\n\r\nHiro, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of the main protagonist. Just like Inuyashiki, he is accidentally killed and reconstructed into an android. Whille Inuyashiki is using his powers for good, Hiro uses his for absolute evil. He doesn't go about starting a criminal empire or invade countries, he is essentially Jack the Ripper. In the beginning, he chooses his victims by doing eeny meeny miney mo. The unlucky ones are straight up murdered in the most horrific and psychopathic ways. However, after a point in the story, he is redeemed. I do think this was a bit rushed but looking at the manga author's track record, it was probably best it ended here before it spiraled into incomprehensible garbage.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for me started to crumble a bit around 3/4 of the way through. As mentioned before, it felt rushed and ended a bit too soon. Small things were cut from this adaption. Some things that were cut didn't annoy me but other things did slightly. I won't go into spoilers as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone that wants to read reviews first before watching it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that some plot points could have been explored more but again, the author probably wanted to end it before he started going batshit crazy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with this series. Seeing someone basically do what kids do when they pretend to be army men and pretend to have guns murder hundreds of people will always be funny to me.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is a spoiler-free review on the anime \"Inuyashiki\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nInuyashiki tried to be mature, but it's just silly fun\r\nAfter Gantz, Hiroya Oku, tried again. The work with which he returned was Inuyashiki. The adaptation to the anime, despite an at least intriguing beginning, has once again been a disappointment.\r\nYou can not blame this on the mangaka, after all his work has a duration of 10 volumes, more than enough time to develop his concept. But the adaptation, of only 11 episodes, lookshasty and consequently thematically ineffective.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nI mentioned in my first impressions that the idea had potential. How do two different people react to acquiring superpowers? Or to be converted into superpowerful cyborgs in any case. However, seen the 11 episodes I can not help but think that once again a work by the author confuses the trees with a forest.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki promises to be a profound work and analysis of human nature but never becomes  in that completely. It is designed so that we feel embarrassed by the behavior of everyone, except its protagonist. This is made to make us believe that the intrinsic goodness of Ichiro Inuyashiki is enough to change the world, but in that case, why make his family so obnoxious at first?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end we see them as a reconciled family, but those changes of attitude are too sudden and do not feel like moments that history has earned. As for its tone, the work also suffers many problems. At times it is almost hilarious because of the circumstances of the premature old man, but then it becomes cruel and ruthless at caricature levels when it is Hiro Shishigami who appears on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand the story tries to be a story about morality, but on the other it resorts to scenes of bad taste and murders even of children, with the clear intention of causing an impact on the spectator. Even in its two protagonists the dichotomy of its characters and sense of morality is totally opposite to a point that is exaggerated. While Ichiro's life has given him the worst possible hand, Hiro has all the cards. One is older, weaker and sicker than he should be and yet he is inclined to do good. The other is young, attractive and with potential and to his new power acts as a sociopath.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that this is not possible, it's just that the characters lack nuances. At least credible nuances, if we consider the conclusion of one of them. I am inclined to think that the fault lies with the adaptation, for not making an adequate transition in the case of Shishigami or the Inuyashiki family. But I would not be surprised if Oku had fallen back into the vices of Gantz.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically it is passable\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf we say the bad, we have to say the good. And it is that Inuyashiki, although it has a serious problem of tone in its history and of brazen haste, is technically passable. The anime was in charge of MAPPA, a fairly young studio that has already given us series like Yuri !!! On Ice and Zankyou no Terror. This is a step back in the technical, but it is visible. No more\\n\\n\r\nIts directors, Keiichi Satou and Shuhei Yabuta, have a not inconsiderable curriculum and that experience is not noticed in this series. Hiroshi Seko, scriptwriter of the series, worked in Shingeki no Kyojin and Kill la Kill, but here, perhaps forced by the short duration of the series, it made a script with many lagoons.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, a fusion of traditional animation and computer graphics was used, which can be a bit shocking. It's nothing new in Oku's works, since he uses computers a lot to draw superrealistic backgrounds in manga. It could be compared with what is seen in the new Berserk, but the truth is that it is better done. Although still strange.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the design of characters, once again, this is a work by the creator of Gantz. Consequently, it is much more realistic. No huge eyes or exaggerated expressions. His style, from Gantz, is more naturalistic than usual in the anime. The same applies to its color palette, which is much more muted than the industry norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are excellent. In fact My Hero by Man with a Mission was on my list of candidates for best entry theme of the year. The ending, Ai wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi e by Qaijff, focuses more on the relationship between Hiro and Shion, with a more melancholic tone that works.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is decent entertainment\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is a series that promised much more than what it gave us. Despite the potential of the idea, the script and tone problems are so marked that they affect the experience. The technical section is acceptable and in some scenes, it comes to shine. However, with its entertaining premise and fast pace, it is hard to say that Inuyashiki is not enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf we see the series without major aspirations, in fact it can be quite entertaining. However, I  must insist that the experience is at best mediocre. We could say that it is a good bad series, if that makes sense. That is to say, it will never be a jewel and its faults are too big to give it a good grade, but as entertainment, it complies.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating:\\n\\n\r\n5.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My review for Inuyashiki : *contains spoilers*\r\nSo i followed this anime from its release hopefully that may be a good masterpiece . The first episode was really emotional and creative but the hype still yet appeared . The Principe was creative tbh , two humans die by a UFo's accidents and the two aliens fix their bodies by a well developed killing machine and it's called \"Robots\" . The next 2 Episode was a description for the other main characters with their relationships and their interests , etc ... without talking about their past . It's was so amazing to see the basics of whata killing machine can do to with its abilities . So the 6th episode , it's all where everything was revealed (Hiro's Dad , His mom's cancer , his care to His mother by deciding to move out from the old house to a well expensive apartment ) And ... The problem when Shishigami been busted by the cops after they know that he's the killer of the 3 Families . Which means that's we are on the edge of the biggest fight . Speaking about fights , it's logically unfair to fight with barehands against a robot instead of it , the creator had a great idea is to make Inuyashiki looks weak and Hiro like a motherfucking boss and the fights had a sense of humor (for me) with some message for the human kind ofc . For the Main fight , it was on ep 10 i really found it hilarious because Hiro was like overreacting and using satelites only to destroy Inuyashiki . At the end , he lost his hand and his .... His ... Idk i can say the back-head xD . Unfortunately , the last episode was really dissatisfying cos it wasn't that good enough to end an anime with 11 eps and i was expecting more . Truly , i'll miss its opening (MAN WITH A MISSION - My hero) i really liked the refrain i can repeat it over and over but for the ending , FUUUUCK it's so fucking Trashy (i don't have a problem with female vocals tbh) . At the end , Inuyashiki really disappointed me and because of it i'll have a break for my anime career until January 6th and I'll continue watching FMAB. So hope you liked my review . GO BEYOND ! PLUS ULTRA !",

            "content": "That's Ricky Tan!? That's a midget in a bath towel. \r\nWhen you hear the name \"Inuyashiki Last Hero\", you probably don't picture a shirtless and Japanese version of Mr. Clean.  Also, when you think of a villain, you don't necessarily believe that character would look like a J-Pop singer and be named \"Hiro\".  If either of those don't sound somewhat intriguing, then you're most likely not going to enjoy this show.  In fact, I'd say you're going to prefer getting repeatedly punched by an overweight putty from the Power Rangers to watching this show. \r\nHowever, if that does sound decently interesting... thenyou have come to the right place.  \\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a show that relies heavily on its quirky style, cliff hanger endings and the moral decision making of its protagonist and antagonist.  Right from the get-go the style meter is off of the charts because Inuyashiki has one of the most memorable openings in recent memory. Think Rage Against The Machine meets Led Zeppelin's Kashmir.  It's catchy, it pumps you up and it sets the tone for each episode flawlessly. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like Death Note, Inuyashiki is a character driven show that plays off of two primary individuals and the effects of their actions. It's cat-and-mouse, but in a way that you haven't seen before.  There are moments in the show that'll make you cry and then there are moments that may disturb you to the point of wanting to turn away. Yes, there's a degree of shock value in the show but I believe it's offset by the show's more serious underlying messages and lessons. \\n\\n\r\nOnce you get started, it will be very difficult to stop because each episode ends on such a dramatic note.  I can't imagine having watched this show as it aired, I would have gone bonkers. For example, during one of the endings...  well, I can't say much but I will say this - swat team. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does a splendid job balancing the screen time, development and morality of the two main characters.  Each episode gives us a little more insight into the minds and motivations of Inuyashiki and Hiro. This is where I see the show shining and giving the audience \"the feels\".  Neither character is 100% certain of who they are or what they want to be and that's what makes each decision of theirs so interesting.  They live in a complex world and whatever choice they make has a massive amount of weight and consequence to it. This is what can make them your favorite character in one episode and your most loathed in the next. \\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a show that can't be missed and must be experienced.  Is it an epic or a masterpiece?  I'd say the sometimes clunky and awkward animation (especially the CGI) and over-the-top shock value hinders it from entering that realm with certainty.  It's extremely enjoyable and at the very least, you'll say to yourself \"What in the blue hell was that?\"\\n\\n\r\nIn case you don't enjoy it...  \\n\\n\r\nI go this way.  You go that way. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Final verdict: Absolutely awesome. I can\u2019t remember being this engrossed in a series for a long time; I couldn\u2019t put it down from start to finish.\r\nFantastic storyline, it had all the things one would hope for. Hero with a heart of gold, psychopathic villain with an existential crisis, incredible action scenes, moral lessons, and a few tear-jerking moments too \u2013 both happy and sad. Basically the only thing it didn\u2019t have was romance (and I suppose you could even argue that if you wanted). \r\nThe art was really good; I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t a cutsey style because it really wouldn\u2019t have fitted here. The CGIwas used well too \u2013 if anyone complains about CGI, just show them this! Music was catchy; the opening really got me pumped for each episode and the soundtracks were on point. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is nothing special \u2013 2 people end up with powers as a result of a strange occurrence. The way they receive their powers doesn\u2019t even matter \u2013 they could just as easily have been struck by lightning, and bitten by a cobra (\ud83d\ude09). It doesn\u2019t even really matter that one of them is a senior citizen, although it made a nice change of pace. No, what matters is what they choose to do with their powers, and the consequences of their choices.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime essentially reminded me of why I love superhero stories in the first place; why I used to obsess over series like the Avengers, X-men and Justice League. They embody a child\u2019s dreams, while handling complex themes in a mature way. Even in this relatively straightforward show, not everything was purely black or white. The protagonist was pretty much as good as you can get, but the antagonist wasn\u2019t purely evil. It was more like he had the mentality of a very young child - completely selfish, but still wants to be loved and wanted by the people he cares about. There were even times when you\u2019d feel pity for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were developed wonderfully \u2013 even without knowing their backstories you got to know them as a person, what drives them, their strengths and weaknesses. What they care about. It\u2019s true, we don\u2019t really get to see what \u2018made\u2019 them this way, but maybe that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t matter. A person could be \u2018made\u2019 into a psychopath by his circumstances, or he could always just have had those tendencies and suddenly receive the power to realise them. It\u2019s how they grow after receiving their powers, and how they view their powers themselves, that makes this such a great watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters differed in terms of character development, but most of them were there only as a foil for the two main characters. It was nice to see how they interacted, for example when a life was saved. Some moments were really touching, but only because of how they affected or related to the protagonist. If I cared about a secondary character, it was only by extension. I think that was fine though \u2013 there was more than enough material on the MCs to make up for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I think this series was incredible. I get that it\u2019s not for everyone, and there were a couple of minor points that could have been handled better. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you\u2019re looking for a rom-com or slice-of-life anime. But if you\u2019re looking for something that reminds you of all your favourite superhero series (albeit a more mature version), or just something with a good plot and lots of action, then Inuyashiki is for you.

            "content": "Inuyashiki is an anime that could have been so much more, if the writer just knew at all how to write compelling characters. I have to admit that for the first few episodes I was hooked, until it became apparent where the show was going. I can't fully explain why this anime is so bad without going into the story, so this review will contain spoilers. However, I will first talk about the dreadful 3D art style, spoiler free.\r\nTo be blunt, it looks horrible. Some moments of the anime are animated in a 2D format, and this is when it looks its best. The 2Dartstyle is actually pretty nice to look at, and the realism of it works well with the dark tone of the show. If the whole anime had been animated like this perhaps my score could have been pushed up to a 4 or 5. However, the 3D aspects of the show look like trash. They poorly try to emulate the 2D portions of the show, but it is incredibly obvious and jarring when the switch to 3D is made- especially because of the motion. In motion, the 3D elements are even more putrid. It's more choppy than running Skyrim on an old laptop with the settings set to ultra. I absolutely hate this forced framerate trying to emulate 2D. ANIMATORS, STOP DOING THIS, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE YOUR ANIME IS LAGGING. If you are gonna use 3D, use it's benefits too! Let it run smoothly! \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, onto the story (spoilers ahead). Basically, two people turn into cyborgs after being hit by a crashing alien spaceship (yep- that's really the premise). One is a kindly old man who heals people, the other is just a complete psychopath who kills people for seemingly no reason. Now, I liked Hiro. Having an older guy as a protag was refreshing since most anime have young protagonists. He's a delight to watch, as he uses his powers to heal people and save people- and it's all quite realistic too. Sure, he doesn't get much development, but he's such a nice character I can forgive that for the most part. And I must commend the voice actor, who brings some real emotion and even some subtlety to the role, which yet again is something anime is sorely lacking in.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem really kicks in when Inuyashiki is introduced. He is about the worst person to receive these powers that could possibly have gained them. If he had gotten the Death Note, all of Japan would be dead before anyone could stop him, let's just say. Inu seems to lack any normal human empathy, and goes around killing families with children and other innocents, seemingly not knowing why it is wrong. This is not a compelling character to watch, which makes it painful that we as the audience seem to have to spend so much time with him. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, Inuyashiki is a good, hateable villain, not a well rounded anti hero. The comparisons to this and Death Note are completely off. Whereas Light had noble intentions delivered in a violent way, Inu just kills people to sate his curiosity, and has no regard for anyone not in his friend group or his mother. The anime's constant attempts to make me understand and empathize with him completely fail. I hated him from the get go, all the way to the end, and my opinion never changed. And no, his actions at the end don't rectify his guilt- he was still the same psycho that he was at the start, and he would have killed more people. If he had been played as a straight up villain until the end, this would have been a far better anime. Or, if the author wanted us to somewhat empathize with him, he should have been a more well rounded character with at least some backstory on why he was such a nasty piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the show doesn't work for me because half of it is attempting to make a serial killing lunatic sympathetic, and it doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nBut the real kicker in all of this? The ending. My God, this anime has the most bs asspull nonsense ending I've seen since LOST. Beware, I am spoiling the ending here (although it doesn't matter, you shouldn't bother watching the show anyway). An asteroid comes down from space, and the two main characters of Hiro and Inuyashiki blow themselves up to save the Earth- the end. Yep, no final confrontation, no Inu having a revelation. The show just ends with a random asteroid coming towards Earth that the two main characters have to kill themselves to save Earth (in Inu's case, only because his friends are down there). This is such lazy writing I am shocked that anyone could give this anime a good rating, let alone all the 9s and 10s I've been seeing. This may just be one of the most overrated anime in history.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict- weak story, weak characters, asspulls, bad CG. Stay away at all costs!",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a very fun and unique anime. \r\nPerhaps the most unique element of this show, which helped draw me in, is the protagonist: 58 year old (who looks much older) Inuyashiki who lacks respect from anyone, including members of his own family. In an entertainment medium where we are spammed with shows consisting of the same generic 16 year old nice guy protagonist: it is refreshing to see a different type of character take the spotlight. \r\nUnknown the me prior to watching the show, there is another main character Shishigami. Shishigami more closely resembles the typical highschool protagonist we usually get, but he isfar from the gentle-mannered nice guy we are used to seeing. While Inuyashiki is a gentle old man who is exhausted of living yet still manages to find it in his heart to love his family and others: Shishigami is an extreme case of an angsty teen- who finds life difficult and cares little for those he is not close with. With these opposite personalities and the coincidence of them being in the same place at the same time: Both are transformed in robots. The story then turns into a \"Good Vs Evil\" type battle, though I use the term loosely, as Inuyashiki and Shishigami do not know about each other early in the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs an old man, Inuyashiki learns about his powers much slower than Shishigami, though he later trains as he learns of the evil acts Shishigami is performing across Japan. While Shishigami is busy killing people in order to give himself some sense of feeling alive, Inuyashiki decides to try and save as many people as possible. \\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of this show is not in its intricate story line or dialogue, but with how enjoyable it is for the viewer. If I were to pick this show apart I could find many minor things that I disliked it in: \\n\\n\\n\r\n- Tons of scenes of people crying in every episode \\n\\n\r\n- The robots are extremely overpowered which ends up in entertaining, but completely ridiculous scenes. \\n\\n\r\n-Plot conveniences for the main characters \\n\\n\r\nEtc. \\n\\n\r\nHowever even with these minor things I have noticed throughout various episodes: I still managed to be on the edge of my seat waiting for what would happen next. Cliff hangers are done well and it is never certain what would happen next. Character motivations are intelligently done: not outright saying why a character is doing an action but leaving it up to the viewer to determine based on subtle actions. There is real anticipation wondering whether a certain character is dead or not- with it never really being clear due to the powers of the robots. And of course, Trump makes an appearance in this show which should be reason enough to watch the hilarious scene. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a great \"Popcorn\" show to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. I binged this show- completing it much faster than I thought I would, and I have no regrets. I cried, I laughed, and i was amused by both the absurdity of the show and its intense action sequences where the result was not immediately known. Yes- much of the overall plot is foreshadowed and can be easily predicted, but each episode is very intense, enjoyable, and has lots of justice porn throughout to satisfy those of us who enjoy that. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this show. While not perfect in an objective sense, its highly enjoyable, creative, and fun. I give this show an 8/10, one of my favorite shows that I've recently completed.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is different from all of the anime I have watched up until now and, to be honest, I was worried about how it'll all turn out. All I can say after finishing it is, this was a great anime that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone. It's a definite change of pace from all the romance and comedy that have been appearing recently, and being given something different was very refreshing. Of course, some anime try too hard to be different and end up being failures and bad and what-not, but this one was very consistent in its execution and delivered something that wasworth my 8 score.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically about how two very polar characters treat humanity. They were once human but turned into machines after an incident, and now they are doing everything they can to feel \"human\", leading one to kill and the other to help. It sounds like something you've heard before but the anime delves much deeper than you might think, giving us a depiction of how devastating social media can be, how our current generation is too ignorant on what's going on in life, how uncaring we are as a society. That's what leads one of our main characters, Hiro Shishigami, to deal with it in a not-so-good way, killing everyone in his path after a tragedy that affected him dearly. You're going to be persuaded into being angry with him at first, because of how \"unsensitive\" he is, but really, he's just doing what makes him feel human, he turned into a machine and is now trying to get his emotions back. You can't blame him, honestly. I mean, a machine can't grasp the idea of \"good\" and \"bad\". \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have an old man, Ichirou Inuyashiki, the titular character in the series. From the start, you're supposed to like him, he's very sweet and his determination to save people is very admirable, like watching a child growing up. It's honestly cute and we get to see this opposite side of the coin. It also helps that the art style that accompanies the anime helps it immensely. The animation fits so well with the tone and vibe, it gives us a modern example of our world. It's mesmerizing to see how well CGI can be used, it's a shame that very few can use it well. I just love it.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are more of like a tool for the main characters. They're the cause of whatever happens in the series, and most of the time, they only appear for one episode. There's a few more important ones that get more screentime, but nothing is too interesting about them except for Hiro's friend, Ando, and Inuyashiki's daughter.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the soundtrack is amazing. We have an opening that's sung mostly in english (amazing!), and then we have a beautiful, sad ending that's lovely to hear.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's what I really loved about this anime. The ending. It was orchestrated so nicely and once the ED played during the last few minutes, it almost brought me to tears and made me realise how great all of this was. Inuyashiki was definitely a nice, enjoyable, sad, happy, ride. It made me feel all kinds of emotions. It was... awesome, to say the least. Like I said in the beginning of this review, I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for something new and unique, but also executed in an excellent way.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want well-written characters, an exhilarating ride, and a plot you can invest in, this is the perfect remedy for your soul. Just be aware that this isn't for the faint of heart.",

            "content": "Story\r\nInuyashiki is a story with incredible depth and nuance. It starts out as this series that really rips and tugs at the heart with Inuyashiki dying because of cancer and wanting to never die. The show then shifts gears just as you know enough about him to focus on pretty much anyone else other than our titular character. Being 11 episodes I\u2019m surprised at how deep the story went, you have these incredibly nuanced topics like; death, sacrifice, murder, but along with that we have hope. And hope is something I didn\u2019t expect this series to have so well sprinkled throughout. Just when the seriesgets to the darkest points, it decides to give these moments afterwards a glimpse of hope, resolution that isn\u2019t just more senseless killing or whatever the topic may be. Inuyashiki is so satisfying because other anime at these moments would just forgo the idea of hope, and continue building up these dark and sad moments. But Inuyashiki gives you that hope, yes a cat was ran over and the cat\u2019s kitten is crying out at it\u2019s parent, but Inuyashiki is there to revive this cat and reset the mood, giving you hope and breaking the tension for a much needed respite. In my opinion, this is what makes this series so beautiful and nuanced. It will go and explore these dark topics with an extreme focus on certain points about it, but at the ends we know Inuyashiki, our series hero is there to make it all better. Inuyashiki is a classic hero you\u2019d see from decades past where he is truly good, and because of this he is the hope the series needs at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect I want to talk about is the pacing, and being 11 episodes, it had to be paced in a certain way. The first 8 episodes primarily focuses on Hiro, and really dissecting his characters. Every moment not spent focusing on Hiro is spent on Inuyashiki, and if they are not focusing on either of them then there is some events that helps move the whole story forward and pushes the envelope. In all honestly, this is a 26 episode series jam packed into an 11 episode series. Episode 4 feels like 12 episodes apart from episode 11. The last three episodes in particular has so much stuff just shoved in there that the episode prior feels like the contents of a whole movie. Which is another point I\u2019d like to bring up, that some episodes feel like whole movie ideas. An episode featuring a kidnaped women being rescued by Inuyashiki could be the basis for a movie in itself. It\u2019s just amazing to me that Inuyashiki was able to pace every episode as well as it did without seeming boring or played out. Sure, there are these scenes here and there that feel shoved away to be brought back up at a later time because they just didn\u2019t have the time to either explore that idea or flesh it out further. That is the one big downfall of this series, I personally would have loved to know even more about Hiro and his family, and just Hiro in general. And that\u2019s funny to because Hiro is sole focus of this series by far, almost all the screen time in the whole series has Hiro in it, or mentioned. Inuyashiki is our other main character, our hero, and he never really gets that much screen time which is a shame too. I\u2019d love to see more about Inuyashiki\u2019s past, how he met his wife, why at such an old age did he decide to have kids? Things like that, which sadly never really got answered. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations\\n\\n\r\nWhile hope is a huge factor in the story side of things, it\u2019s not so much in the character side of things. This stories characters feel so absolutely real, which I think is just another ism that the creator of the manga has his finger on really well. He knows what kids are thinking all around the world, it honestly feels like he himself is in the trenches along with us. It doesn\u2019t feel like a writer is putting his own personal beliefs into this story's characters at all, but rather making characters out of the times. For example, what we really have here in this story is a classic example of Pure Good vs. Pure Evil. Inuyashiki-san is purely good, he gave his whole life to his work firm, he supports his family, he\u2019s blue collar, hell he even take in a dog. Then he gets his powers and starts healing people, animals, anything that is there he is there to help. But what really makes Inuyashiki more relatable is that he speaks and acts like a real person. His \u201cpure good\u201d is not realistic, but when you start to add on things, like him not understanding how to use a smartphone or as another example him not knowing how to throw punches. He\u2019s a man that with even more development becomes even more human and realistic. It\u2019s not the good qualities that make him good, it\u2019s how human he is and how he wants to be perceived. \\n\\n\r\nHiro on the other hand is Pure Evil\u2026 which now that I think about it may not be as true. Hiro kills and kills and kills, as he is a sociopath. He is disconnected from his own humanity and doesn\u2019t feel like you and I. As an example, he says to his best friend in Episode 1 or 2, he doesn\u2019t care about other people dying, he only cares about his friend only. No spoilers, but even in the end, it seems like he still doesn\u2019t care about the outcome, but only for the people he cares about. This is a huge departure already from Inuyashiki-san, as Inuyashiki is a person who wants to give life back to others, to help rather than take. Although Hiro I feel is what many people today are an example of, how many people do you know who have said, \u201cI don\u2019t care if other people die\u201d. In this day and age I bet you right now for at least half the people watching you\u2019ve experienced someone saying this. And I don\u2019t mean, \u201cOh it\u2019s too hard to care when it happens every day\u201d. I mean someone who truly does not care. Hiro is a character I both deeply hate and care for all at the same time. I don\u2019t want to see anything bad happen to Hiro, but when he does something bad I want to see the repercussions put upon him. He\u2019s not a black/white character as he\u2019s more of a person who is deeply flawed, what I\u2019m trying to say is he\u2019s a sociopath that may have been created from his own society. That to me is more interesting that a Star Wars or Marvel villian, that to me is truly scary.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction here goes for a more modern and realistic tone to it. I believe they went with this over a cartoon feeling like other anime because it helped set the tone visually that this series is going to delve into some pretty deep topics. But does it work out like they wanted it to? Well to simply answer I don\u2019t think it was anywhere near perfect, but at the same time the story more than makes up for the faults in the art. But let\u2019s get into why that is. The art direction they went for was the correct one to pursue, but I think because of budgeting constraints it wasn\u2019t as sharp or clean as they wanted it to be. Honestly, most people won\u2019t really care for the art, as it\u2019s quality is something that reminds me of Stand Alone Complex, which is a beloved series, but it\u2019s like if Stand Alone Complex was never updated, and the CGI was bad. Background shots are pretty well detailed though, but there was just some episodes where the budget really shows. Characters looking very blurry in the face or losing details and shaders in some scenes. Go in expecting a budgeted art direction, and you\u2019ll be good to go.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nMaybe not the best in the world, Inuyashiki aims for a blend of traditional animation with CGI elements in toe. In terms of an art perspective, these are some great CGI models, especially when you observe the inside of Hiro and Inuyashiki\u2019s robotic chassis. When in movement everything really starts to fall apart. Things look incredibly cheap sometimes, and while nothing is as bad as Black Clover, it gets to points where some things look a little stiff when they shouldn\u2019t be. Animation is not something that will really stand out for being good, but rather looking cheap. Then again, this may be cleared with a Blu-Ray release and a little more work.\\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nBecause everyone is talking about it, let\u2019s start the score off with the opening My Hero by Man With A Mission, a Japanese Rock band that in name and look is a homage to Bad Religions album Man With A Mission. The opening song My Hero lends itself to more of the Rap-Rock side of things, but don\u2019t let that fool you. Man With A Mission was able to write a song that fit the story of Inuyashiki. Of course I won\u2019t be analysing the song here, there are others who could do it better than me, but I will go on record as saying it\u2019s tied with me for opening of 2017 with MMO Junkie\u2019s Saturday Night Question. As for the rest of the score, it\u2019s another one of those that\u2019s minimalistic which I can\u2019t tell if it was genius or a necessity because of their budget. But the score is great otherwise, and the last episode really shines as the best the score has to offer. So look out for that in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is a special anime, it\u2019s not perfect which knocks it down some pegs, but it\u2019s still a story that was beautifully told in the 11 episodes it had. Through its limitations it gave us a truly great 11 episodes of can\u2019t miss anime.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki gets a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThis score may seem high to some, but I thought that the story, characters and visual storytelling all made up for its faults technically with the art and animation. I still felt though that it didn\u2019t hit a 10/10 for those reasons and because it had a score that just needed a little extra push which it didn\u2019t get. And a lot of people may not know this, but anime like Inuyashiki, Gantz, Cowboy Bebop, those are all anime that are my bread and butter, I was raised on anime that told a story first, and did everything else second. This to me stands right up there with anime like Monster when we talk about the story, is it right to compare the two? No, but Inuyashiki found a way into my heart, and because it did it\u2019s already one step ahead of many other anime on the market. Honestly, this one was so close to an 8/10, but I just felt that this one showed the quality of an anime that I saw was a 9/10.",

The thing about it is, even though everything from story to character is so-so, the anime was bale to create a connect with me and keep me looking forward to the next episode. Therefore, I was able to binge watch it without any hassles!\r\nI have only one complaint and that is with the ending. It was totally abrupt and the plot-line was introduced to close the series faster than I thought! IMO, the anime got axed for all you know!\r\nAnyways, if you are missing some good anime and wantsome emotional scenes to bring tears in your eyes, this anime might be worth the shot!",

A old age depcited as a hero saving humans with his power of kindness and never to give attitude. What is more appealing are the dailogues. Simple one liners out of inyuyashiki hit right on the spot. \r\nI really like the art work, animation rich in emotions and last the dialogues.\r\nHowever, it would have given it 10/10 if background audio could have been more powerful with the scene. Destruction of asteroid or fightingof the two could be more entertaining if sfx were more powerful. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, i enjoyed the anime. Thank you very much :)",

I liked Hiro too as a character. But the main problem I got was the ending. Episode 10 was dope, one of my fav episode, but the last one was kinda disapointing. I don't like how Hiro changed his mind, and how the last threat is being serious in the last 15 minutes of the show(yes I know it was mentionned in earlier episodes). I just felt the show was trying to be the most stirring/pathetic possible.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked:\\n\r\n- Art (there were some astonishing scenes)\\n\r\n- Characters (but not at the end)\\n\r\n- Main plot\\n\r\n- And the amazing opening!\\n\r\n- Some scenes were very marking\\n\\n\r\nWhat I did not liked:\\n\r\n- Hiro's character (how he is changing his mind)\\n\r\n- The ending scene\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't like this anime. I would recommend it 100%, but the ending is just too disapointing.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this review isn't that good, it's my first one :)",

            "content": "One of the more interesting and emotionally driven anime I\u2019ve seen this season, Inuyashiki is a concentrated look into the psyche of two individuals at two ends of the spectrum in attempts to see what i means to be human. \r\nInuyashiki is the anime adaption of the manga by Hiroya Oku, some may be familiar with his previous works such as Gantz. Like Gantz, Inuyashiki provides a brutal insight on people\u2019s motivations and desires, and I think that leads to some of the show\u2019s interesting moments. \r\nBeyond the first episode, we don\u2019t get a background of the aliens or any other understanding of the howor why the two characters become cyborgs. At best, it was all chance, and I think that allows for the anime to dive into other ideas and gives much more depth to the story they do push. \\n\\n\r\nImmediately after the life altering event occurs, the anime begins to split the story as the two individuals, Shishigami and Inuyashiki don\u2019t remember seeing each other the night the aliens crashed into them. We get two perspectives of how the characters are adapting to their lives and how they wish to use their new bodies. On one hand, we have Inuyashiki going around trying to save as many people as he can and stop crimes, while Shishigami uses his body to begin murdering people. It comes to a head when they confront each other, facing off for the first time. It is a strange encounter since neither of them recognizes the other or the fact that they are both cyborgs. This sets up the rest of the show as we see Shishigami fall deeper into is mania and  Inuyashiki continues to find meaning in his life by helping others, and the inevitability of the two meeting again for a final clash is what drives the story to its end, for the most part at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe two characters have great depth and are interesting to watch. We see Inuyashiki as a broken man who finally has a chance to make his life matter, and that really pushes him. This simplicity to his motives is pushed by his supporting cast. His family doesn\u2019t really appreciate him and he is really just trying to do something that would make them proud, despite hiding his truth from them. His other support comes in the form another teen who ends up becoming his sidekick as Inuyashiki navigates all of his powers tries to save the people of the world.\\n\\n\r\nShishigami is another case altogether. There is very little motivation to what he does, and one of the questions that failed to be answered as the anime progressed. There are hints that he feels human when he takes lives, but it never goes deeper than that. The sheer brutality of Shishigami is offset a little with his interpersonal relationships. He has a love for his mother that seems honest enough, and we see his actions get more radical when his mother dies. His other relationships in the show come from a classmate who confessed her feelings for him, and he ends up living with her and her grandmother, which again tries to humanize Shishigami a little and it seems to work for a bit, but not for long. The efforts to characterize Shishigami as a troubled individual only works to make the show more interesting in that he becomes an unpredictable entity that lingers over humanity and can only be undone by someone who is the same and at the same time the complete opposite of him. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is full of action from the beginning to the end. The sequences are well put together, flow well, and are quite dynamic with a crazy amount of depth and layering to them. This all is possible and possibly set back by the heavy use of CG for these complex scenes. It was strange to the anime switch between traditional and more nuanced forms of animation but I think the creators used it to their advantage and we were given a cohesive anime that can stand up to most of the other anime of the season. \\n\\n\r\nThe music didn\u2019t stand out much from the show. If any, it probably fit in, it was very much a backseat element to everything else that was going on with the anime. I will say that the opening song and sequence were one of my favorites this season. It is a really great composition and sums up the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy Inuyashiki, despite little bumps in the art direction somewhat strange characterization of the protagonist and antagonist. It was an immersive anime and surprised me week after week. It progressed pretty fast, but each episode held just the right amount of storytelling to make it feel balanced. I will say that the ending, like everything else, came out of nowhere and it kind of disappointed me, just because it wasn\u2019t where I saw it going. We even get a cameo of Donald Trump cameo with a spot on portrayal of how horrible of a president let alone a person he is. Inuyashiki also had some of the most uncomfortable crying I\u2019ve seen in an anime, but nonetheless, this anime had everything necessary to make it enjoyable and one of my favorite of the season. \\n",

I instantly knew this anime would cross boundaries never crossed before. The art fits in perfectly as it is more realistic, and matches the tone of anime. The characters are maybe the best part of this show. Our MC Inuyashiki is simply relatable regardless of your age. You really feel as though you are in his shoes and can sympathize with him. The antagonist Shishigami is one evil bastard and yet kind hearted person at the same time. Throughout the show youexperience a cycle of emotions towards him from hatred to maybe hes not so bad, then back to hatred then maybe hes ok. Definitely a character with multiple layers. The ending was sad and beautiful and it gave me those rare sense of closure I tend not to receive from anime within the 12 episode range.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is very interesting and very enjoyable. Obviously by my rating I would advise it to almost everyone ( well on the condition that you are ok with gore ).  \\n",

            "content": "They say that given enough time, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  This interesting moral dilemma of what it takes to do the right thing is the basis for many hero stories, elevating them to be more than just a simple hero\u2019s journey.  Based on this principle, Inuyashiki takes this concept and turns it into a battle of muddied philosophy that ends up more black and white than the intended shade of gray.\r\nStory:\r\nWithout a purpose in his life, Inuyashiki Ichirou spends his life in a seemingly unloving family who despite his best efforts isnever given even a smidgen of love or respect from those closest to him.  After one last attempt at failing to get closer to his family by bringing home a stray dog, he runs off into the night and finds himself in a park begging for a purpose in life.   It is there when mysterious and unexplained life forms from another world barge in and accidentally kill this man and another bystander, haphazardly replacing their entire bodies with weaponized systems in order to cover up their tracks.  Now with a body capable of flight, combat, and technological prowess, he vows his existence to help those in need.  While a certain high school boy has other things in mind.  \\n\\n\r\nA naturally story heavy series, Inuyashiki is a show that attempts to use a majority of its available time in order to create a moral dilemma of what it means to be human and do the right thing.  Since our dual protagonists both have bodies entirely replaced with mechanical parts, the possibility of trying to return to that feeling of being truly alive wavers in their minds and eventually set the two on different paths in order to find themselves through the use of various scenarios that ask our protagonists the question of \u201cwhat would you do in this situation?\u201d in order to cement them on one side of the argument.  \\n\\n\r\nA very interesting concept, but is sullied by one key reason: balance.  Thing is, Mr. Inuyashiki himself really doesn\u2019t get that much screentime comparatively.  While yes the beginning of the show is devoted solely to his readjustment to his new existence, the rest of the series can be summed up as \u2018The Marvelous Body Count of a Sociopathic Murderer\u2019.  The first protagonist that we\u2019re introduced to hardly ever gets the spotlight, and the series puts so much emphasis on the other side of the story that the actual confrontation between the two is more of a fight between good and evil rather than one between similar yet conflicting morals.  Furthermore, the short 11-episode timespan really works against the show because it always felt like the show was rushing somewhere and never gave the viewer enough time to rest and fully take in what we\u2019re given, especially with how everything turns out as the episodes progress.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, this culminates into another major problem of the series escalating things to almost ridiculous lengths that I can\u2019t really take what happening seriously anymore.  Or at the very least, it doesn\u2019t really make sense to me cause half the time it feels like the show makes these huge leaps in logic in order to try and make whatever\u2019s happening \u2018justified\u2019.  Or something.  The ending is the worst offender to all of this cause the whole of it feels like a haphazardly thrown in conclusion that we literally get no prior warning of anywhere in the series.  At the end of the day, the series doesn't feel satisfying or provides any form of thought-provoking resolution that constitutes anything worth thinking about for the future.  And that is a real darn shame.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Unique concept\\n\r\n+ Certainly poses some interesting questions\\n\r\n-  Appears more black and white than gray\\n\r\n-  Escalates in a manner that doesn\u2019t make sense\\n\r\n-  Motives feel clunky at best, messy at worst\\n\r\n-  What the actual fuck is that ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nRather than a full cast of intriguing characters for us to spend time with the characters in Inuyashiki boil down to the MCs and literally everyone else.  I\u2019ll explain why that is, but first,\\n\\n\r\nMr. Inuyashiki himself is certainly an entertaining idea for a main character.  An old man who finds a new purpose in life by using his now fully mechanized and mechanical body for good, much of what he represents is acting as the \u2018hero\u2019 and helping those who cannot help themselves.  An interesting character indeed, but without really much weight to his actions.  Sure he\u2019s partially doing it out of the goodness of his heart, but his home situation leads us to believe that there\u2019re other reasons why he selfishly chooses to help people to fulfill himself.  Problem is, the first episode rushes through his crappy situation so fast that there\u2019s very little impact for the audience to really give a damn.  The poor build-up thrusts everything wrong in Mr. Inuyashiki\u2019s life without much word or warning is not very favorable storytelling, which doesn't translate well to the eventual changes that again feel rushed and out of place.  Above that, very rarely do we get an opposite perspective that what Mr. Inuyashiki is wrong.  Maybe this is just personal bias talking, but to me, the show does such a poor job at muddying the waters enough to raise enough questions that I can\u2019t really see much gray when everything is shown in black and white when it comes to the actions and sometimes motives of this man.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Hiro, or as I like to call him, the show\u2019s main problem.  Ironically named \u2018Hero\u2019, Hiro spends most of the series showing off his sociopathic tendencies as compared to Mr. Inuyashiki, he kills innocents to feel alive rather than helping individuals with his newfound power.  I\u2019m sorry, but if you ask me, none of what he\u2019s doing makes sense cause we hardly get any rhyme or reason as to what led him to value human life so cheaply.  The mind of the sociopathic is an interesting way to go about the moral dilemma, but it\u2019s really hard to establish an equal footing on the two characters since one spends the majority of the series saving lives, while the other takes them.  Because the timeframe of the show is so short, I feel like there is more to this boy, but since I\u2019ve never read the original source material, I can only make the assumption that the show unfortunately had to cut off a lot of the potential backstory and explanations to both justify and humanize his actions.  Cause seriously, this guy\u2019s body count doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cBad to good\u201d, and Mr. Inuyashiki\u2019s track record is pretty squeaky clean in comparison.   \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast unfortunately falls into the category of symbolism than characters.  Everything from deplorable human beings that test the characters\u2019 code of ethics, to people that shows us that there\u2019s a reason to save people in this world.  Much of the cast is meant to only give weight to the battle of personal philosophy between our dual protagonists and as such, exist only as fodder for us to watch the result of since their stories are meant to directly impact them rather than give us a functional cast.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  MCs emphasize a very clear good/evil divide rather than a perceived gray dilemma \\n\r\n-  Side cast are rather unimportant aside from story fodder\\n\r\n-  Seriously, character motives are very questionable\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe show was made by MAPPA and really stands out as some of the lowest quality art that the studio has managed to pull out in its short and youthful existence.  (What, did Kakegurui take too much out of the budget?)  The big problem I see here is waning.  The quality of the art wavers from \u2018kind of ok\u2019 to \u2018you just didn\u2019t try\u2019, as the entire color scheme of the show poses this really drab but not at all dynamic style that just isn\u2019t interesting to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but the people can just look downright ugly sometimes.  I know it\u2019s harking back to the original style of the source material, and the style is meant to be more realistic, but often times I would curdle away from my screen because one or more of the characters\u2019 faces would look just so unappealing that I kind of didn\u2019t want to watch anymore, which doesn't help when often times the show uses close ups so we REALLY get to see their ugly mugs.  I\u2019m probably just running my mouth about this, but I just don\u2019t like the style.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s far from the biggest issue about the art.  Roughly half the show is done in CGI in order to easily animate the robotic parts and sections of the dual protagonists body.  The reason for this is understandable given how complex the implanted weaponry can be, but why use it in the normal animation?  During scenes with the character simply walking around or standing normally, the show falls back on the CGI models and really clashes with the background environment, even going so far as to replace entire scenes using these models to save on costs.  I\u2019m not sure why the show seemingly has no budget, but the results show, and the results aren\u2019t pretty.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Some surprisingly fluid fight scenes (because CGI is always fluid)\\n\r\n-  Below average art quality\\n\r\n-  Uses CGI in areas that I feel like don\u2019t need CGI\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nWith an OP made by Man with a Mission, the band known for having one-liners in songs, \u201cMy Hero\u201d stands out with the new slogan of \u201cHIT ME ON THE GROUND\u201d as the chorus with an action-packed and high-energy song that\u2019s about as memorable as their other works, which is pretty standard fare for the band considering how catchy \u2018database\u2019 is.  Yes that is a compliment.  In comparison, the show\u2019s ED, \"Ai wo Oshiete Kureta Kimi e\u201d, is a more somber piece that\u2019s meant to symbolize the internal struggle with our dual protagonists with a piano-based beat and soft vocals, a definite contrast that\u2019s just as good as its OP counterpart.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nBased on personal preference alone, Inuyashiki was a series that was way out of my comfort zone, as I don't typically watch shows that base their entire concept on semantics, and I'm really not a fan of deformation of the human body, even if mechanical.  So I fully admit that this show was not for me.  That being said, I did hear good things about the series and wanted to jump the chance and see what it\u2019s about so I could potentially have something more than the slew of slice of life-based stuff that I usually watch in a given season.  You know, get out of my comfort zone and stuff and explore.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show.  Honestly, I did.  But episode after episode posed some weird situations that don\u2019t really make sense if you ask me.  The series spends the brunt of its focus on Hiro like he\u2019s supposed to have some kind of redemption, but everything felt way too fast and way too shallow for me to care.  I was initially intrigued at how the show would approach the sociopathic individual, but nothing really came to fruition at the end and that irked me because now all we have is a battle of good and evil rather than a battle over who is in the right cause supposedly, both Mr. Inuyashiki and Hiro doing both good and bad things is supposed to give the viewer a conflicting viewpoint.  And that just didn\u2019t resonate or show with how things were going.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking, no.  I know the show is probably not for me, but looking at it from a critical eye, I find a lot of faults with its storytelling, a sociopath that the show fails to get you to really sympathize with (Several thousand wrongs and a couple hundred rights do not make a right.  Even with that ending you're still an asshole), and an escalation that blew everything so out of proportion that I couldn\u2019t take it seriously.  By the very end I sat mindblown not from the quality of the show, but from trying to process what the fuck I just watched cause everything went from zero to a hundred so fast I needed a minute to catch my breath.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nObvious ones the ones I complained about in the question above (ironic, I know), what is up with those aliens at the start?  No, seriously.  You can\u2019t expect me to just forget that that ever happened.  I understand they\u2019re supposed to be used as a plot tool to get the characters into their robotic forms, but when you introduce something like that, you are just begging for questions to be asked.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally\u2026no.  I understand a lot of people are fans of the series and it\u2019s praised for having a good story, but if that\u2019s the case, then this anime is really going to disappoint you.  Eleven episodes is so short for such a huge philosophy/story driven show, and being unable to put down enough groundwork to make that dilemma stand out is a major problem that never gets resolved.  Whether or not the original source material is any good is an opinion I cannot have because I have never read it.  But.  If the praises sung about the original material is true, then I\u2019d suggest go reading that instead because MAPPA really dropped the ball here.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a good anime. It is not one of the best, but I think it's worth of your time. \r\n- May contain spoilers -\r\nThe story is convincing. It's about 2 men that get exploded by some alien beigns (which should have been more explored) that give them super powers by turning them into machines. So far so good. One of the characters goes to the dark side of the force and the other tries his best to save people. They both have the premisses of 'wanting to feel alive, feel human'. And are well constructed. \r\nThe thing I like the most, or at leastthat got my attention is that they break almost all the patterns seen in animes in general. The main character, the good one, is an old man who nobody cares, not even his family and the evil one is a young, well related and loved high-school boy. I think picking and old man for an action anime is a risk to take, specially if you consider the public. And they show how it doesn't matter where you live or how people treat you, what really matters is who you are (or at least try hard to be), because bad things happen to everyone. \\n\r\nThe only clich\u00e9s happen in the murder or tragedy parts to chock the viewers.\\n\r\nI don't like 3D animations in general and this one specially has a quite poor animation, in the 3D parts it gets even worse. Things are all robotic here - pun intended haha.\\n\r\nSound is ok, intro is bad, but ending is good. The only thing I didn't like was the seiyuu they picked for the old man, since his voice doesn't sound old. Screamings seem forced as well.\\n\r\nThis is a good piece, but is not the one for me. The dark parts seem to shock me too much, I'm very sensitive when it's about psycho murderers.",

            "content": "Anime is weird, no matter how you look at it. The fan base is criticized for being weird and we often try to fight it back, however deep in our hearts we can't argue with the fact that anime can be a tad bit strange sometimes. Now, let's talk about the beautiful story about a flying robotic mecha grandpa trying to save the world from psychotic man who likes to talk about One Piece after murdering an entire family. \r\nStory/premise:\r\nThe premise for this show is unoriginal, however the directors managed to put their own little twist to it, making this show more original than anyoriginal show that exists so far. I mean come on, how many times have we seen guy getting super powers and fighting off a super villain with similar powers to save the world? That is basically any super power genre show and Inuyashiki is essentially the same thing. However, what if I tell you it's a grandpa that gets the superpower and on top of that he is a mecha who can fly around and shoot lasers from his back AND he fights guy who has equal superpowers? Now that sounds more original. The way the show changes up such a simple premise and turns it into such an original plot is impressive. Although, you can't deny it but if the grandpa was switched with a typical mc, it would be a pretty bland plot and I admit that the plot for Inuyashiki is definitely not anything new, it's just the way they handle it is a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nArt/animation: \\n\r\nThis show has some pretty interesting CGI animations that give off some interesting vibes. Although a lot of CGI is often criticized for being \"bad\" or \"inquired\" I think Inuyashiki has one of the better CGI out there. The action sequences are well animated, they feel very real when they are being executed. Some of the flight sequences are also really cool and very well animated. Even though I am not going to lie, the CGI can feel out of place sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I feel like a lot of people will find the opening to be good, but I simply found it to be very bland, even though it isn't terrible. I never wanted to completely skip the opening.  The ED on the other hand is very heart warming, it is a breath of fresh air from the darker moments in the show. I also found the ED to be extremely catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters is where the show really shines, especially the antagonist, Shishigami. I absolutely loved the main antagonist of this anime, Shishigami is sadistic, evil, bad ass and sympathetic. He is one of the type of villains, you will care for and absolutely hate them at the same time. The show never really explains the reasons of why this character has decided to be so evil. However, even though Shishigami is a literal killer who just likes to kill randomly for fun. He comes off as a very sympathetic character even though there are no reasons to back up his actions. How can a show possibly make an antagonist so special without giving them any reason to back up their actions you may ask? Well my answer to that is, usually evil means, the antagonist has to be selfish. That is definitely not true, Shishigami is selfless and that's what makes him so special. I don't want to spoil too much about his character, but he is one of the few villains that completely change the definition of \"evil.\" Now you may be asking, why did I spend 90% of this character analysis section talking about only ONE character? My answer to that is, that's because they give most of the screen time TO this villain instead of focusing on our protagonist. By the time I ended the show, I completely forgot that the protagonist was that flying grandpa. Although the main villain has some of the best character development, this show forgets about the main protagonist and some of the other characters half way through, making their characters feel a bit under developed. Yeah, we do get some of the family background of flying grandpa here and there but it's less prioritized than the main villain's character development. But, the show does a pretty good job at still managing to make the other characters with little character development likable enough to enjoy the story. An issue I had with the protagonist is that there were several fight scenes involving the grandpa, where instead of properly punching enemies in the face, he would hug them. That made me scream at my screen plenty of times to try and tell this man to PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE! I mean, I get it that grandpa is old and he needs some hugs in his life, but it's best to use your super powers to maybe punch them in the face instead of trying to hug them until they explode of something. That was just a minor flaw, but worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I personally really enjoyed the show, I really liked the CGI, fight sequences, the characters and the really awesome ED that I absolutely loved. Inuyashiki has a though provoking story line and it managed to keep me engaged till the very end.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki seems to be quite an odd show, in that it seems to get one thing right, but foregoes something else in return. For instance, our main character is a 58 year old salaryman, depressed at his unloving and unappreciative family, which I think is quite a good thing, because it's a breath of fresh air to see an anime MC beyond school age, as is an MC who isn't a blank slate for the purpose of easier self-insertion for the viewer, and our story begins with him being diagnosed with stomach cancer and having 3 months left to live. He goes for a walkin the park and finds after a very brief visit by a UFO and explosion, has become a cyborg with superpowers including but not limited to flying, superhuman strength and enhanced hearing. With his newfound powers (plus with his cancer having been cured), he decides to help those in need, in typical superhero fashion. But during this explosion, there was another person present, named Hiro Shishigami, a young lad who is for all intents and purpose, a Japanese Dylan Klebold, and Hiro decides to use his powers to completely eliminate the population of Japan, just because he enjoys murder, and this is what I referenced earlier with one thing right, and other thing foregone. Inuyashiki is a good character, but Hiro is a terrible one. The most uncompelling villain I think I've ever seen. Killing people just because, what's the point? It's not even as if he's a repressed bully victim, they didn't flesh him out at all.\\n\r\nStill, it's not a bad show, even with such a poor antagonist, and it's not as though Inuyashiki spends all his time in the show hunting down Hiro, in fact it's not until quite late, before this point he's mostly just saving people, quite unaware of Hiro's presence (or to be more precise, his exact location and thereby a means of stopping him). Still, the progression of the story is well-done, the director did a good job of withholding the important action scenes and such, action which was quite well orchestrated, and this is coming from someone who generally dislikes superheroes. CGI was also quite solid, barring one or two instances wherein it was noticeably poor. The sound design, and especially the soundtrack were perhaps a step above everything else, but really I'm running out of things to say here.\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Inuyashiki is a decent show. It's good an above-average protagonist, at the cost of a considerably poor antagonist, but it's certainly not bad. Ending was a bit odd, Hiro's motivations were very questionable, but the writing wasn't poor, I suppose maybe it's wrong of me to expect complete transparency and consistency with psychopathic mass murderers. All things considered, the show isn't bad, but it's not really a show I think I'll be watching a second time, nor has it made me reflect on my overall opinion of the superhero genre.",

It's what got me hooked from the start until the end, and there's a lot of thought-provoking material.The characters are unique and engaging, the pace is (mostly) well-set, and though it's largely a serious/dramatic show, there's plenty of entertainment and comic relief sprinkled in.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can suspend your disbelief of the story and look past some of the plot holes, I can easily recommend Inuyashiki.",

If you are looking for a short, ruthless and gory show, this is a good ride.\r\nI really feel like I need to discuss the not-good-at-all ending though, so SPOILERS AHEAD (This just needs to be said, if I am going to do a review.):\r\nUp to the 10th episode, I had rated this show an 8. It was just so enjoyable altogether, and had my heart pumping thanks to how unpredictable Hiro was. \u00bfWill he or won't he kill this dude or this other dude? You seriouslycouldn't know, and that made every single episode tense AF. Episode 10 actually got some tears out of me, out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nBut when I realized there was one more episode I felt that the author just REEEEALLY wanted to be super-conclusive, but reeeeeeaallly didn't feel like writing another arc (Ajin, for example, suffers from too much time with the same villain, so I don't blame him for that). And so, even though it was foreshadowed, the giant-stone thing just felt like bs. \\n\\n\r\nAre you telling me that seriously, after some quite good technological and power-scale consistency throughout the series, you give us a slew of convenient inconveniences? The Americans don't have a spare nuke to send out, or can't make one in the MULTIPLE WEEKS they have, even though the entire planet depended on it?\\n\\n\r\nLike seriously, just nuke the damn thing! A few times if necessary! YOU HAVE THE MONEY!!! AND YOU HAVE BRUCE WILLIS!\\n\\n\r\nImmediately after Trumps announcement, it was clear to me that this anime wanted to finish off Hiro with some redemption. It was as predictable as an ending can get. And well, I mean, I would have kept the 8/10 on the show if that happened. But nope, apparently the \"power to destroy a planet\" can't even MOVE a stone that's 1000 times smaller. Oh! But two of them surely can blow it into pieces! \\n\\n\r\nWhat.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not how you physics. It felt cheap, rushed, and forced. It was an ending that was not thought through properly, and it just kinda ruins the whole ride.\\n\\n\r\nSo 8/10 for the whole show, 5/10 for that ending. There you go.",

            "content": "Both an anime and an accurate depiction of the real world, Inuyashiki, a 11 episodes long show (there was a dark pun on episode 9 behind this odd number of episodes) full of real-world references and irony from the same creator of the massively successful series, GANTZ, that doesn't fall short on delivering the same amount of twisted and dark turnouts every episode. Filled with superheroism treats, but unlike One Punch Man and Boku no Hero Academia, this one helps itself to be as twisted and straight to the point than the last two mentions for what it holds of emotion and threats as itmanaged to dive into the more prominent psychological problems, what makes one a hero and the other a villain.\\n\r\nAgain, something I mention in most of my reviews, but more with this one. I think the R (+17) rating labeling this series could never be well placed, there are extreme gore and more importantly sexual content in here. To what degree? well, naked women and men are very common, having conversations and that state. If that wasn't enough, they even go hardcore with a dude forcing another one to give him a blowjob, ugh. That aside, let's hit the keyboard and discuss some of the show's most prominent aspects.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (8.5/10):\\n\r\nIchirou Inuyashiki, an old guy in his 50s (with a grandpa look like he's in his 80s or something) is living through the worst phase of his life, suffering from liver cancer, surrounded with angry family members that don't seem to give the guy a breather at all happens to get exposed to some mysterious extraterrestrial figures that turn his into a super advanced robot capable of destroying the earth. At the same moment, another guy happened to be passing by that got the same powers, Hiro Shishigami, a role model highschooler that seems to spend his days with his otaku friend Ando reading Manga all day long.\\n\r\nThe story focuses on this two main protagonists who are antagonists of each other go through using their newly acquired powers in opposing manners, one saves people, the other murders them. All the events of the story move at a considerably fast pace that never lets you complain how boring the show is (which definitely is not). Propos to the direction team for handling the transitions between the two protagonists smoothly and this well.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.3/10):\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the art style this series has chosen to stick to is amazingly stunning and fits very well serious stories like this one. I loved how realistic character faces and expressions were like, no over-exaggerated eye sizes, no crazy Anime hairstyles, nothing of that. Most of the characters are actually ugly or average looking, sad truth, but most people in the real world are.\\n\r\nSeeing how this show is labeled as an action thriller, it doesn't fall short of shinning at fast fluid movements on all of the fights, lasers shooting and superspeed flying has never looked so fluid. The art style is depicted in a way that makes it blend with 3D animations very easily looking at how it relies on 3D animations most of the time because how often complex mechanic transformation happens. I'm fine with the CGI usage in this show's case, it doesn't bother me 80% of the time, but God, at one scene it looked so awful I couldn't even keep looking without having painful flashbacks of those shitty 3D games of the 2000 that barely even run on the highly capable PS1 of the era.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nNow, this is a series full of massacres, so it's natural to get to hear screams, people freaking out... I think that the voice acting cast did that job perfectly (talking about the SUB here), some performances even left me trembling from shivers, the fear of the voices was only complimented by the crazy realistic ugly faces that come with it. And don't even get me started on the opening and ending themes songs. Those were so marvelous pieces of music, you get the hyped up opening to get you reading to start savage episodes, and then a calm ending theme song to help let the feels flow looking at how often you'll get to tear up at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (9.0/10):\\n\r\nMost of the shows can screw up this part really easily with annoying or unrealistic characters, but Inuyashiki not only takes places on a real-time setting but also brings up relatable human beings that makes you go, Oh, I could be on that guy's shoes. Also, the two main characters are one of the finest there are. First, we have Ichirou, an old dude who's lived most of his life as a casual citizen, acting good, working, a family type of guy, then he gets exposed to a greater fate than he could have ever dreamed off seeing how he never was the type of popular dude in his entire life. Never be the guy to hit on girls or be the center of the spotlights. Makes you think he would take advantage of his new powers to relive the things he missed, but his old age, wiseness, and experience of the world made him think of the powers as a means to save people, a blessing from the Gods that he has to act good with. And then you get the edgy hot high school boy, still in his rebellious days with nobody to guide him that easily began murdering people just because he was bored, and simply because he could. Very people with the same fate but lacking what their counterpart has.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (9.0/10):\\n\r\nI always slack off finishing my shows, but Inuyashiki was a different story. I know there are being that can finish off 11 episodes on one setting, and I used to be one, but not anymore, my desire to follow up with the story lead me to finish the whole thing in 2 days sessions even though my time is super limited, if they didn't screw up the CGI parts sometimes, it would have been one of the greatest shows of its kind. Other than that, it was super exciting to know what happens next at the end of every episode, something that rarely ever happens to me. One other thing was the excessive references to One Piece and its Mangaka Eiichiro Oda, God bless him.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (8.7/10):\\n\r\nWell, I tend to rewatch my favorite shows with my family 90% of the time, but unfortunately, not with this one. I'm mostly fine with minimal partial sexual references, have it be as gory as you want, but just don't over sexual the thing, and I'll be fine sharing it with family. Inuyashiki, unfortunately, crossed some lines there and went extremely at one point. But still, if you're on your own and don't mind sexual content, this series will have its effects on you. Buckle up and get some tissues ready though, this is one action centered show that will hit you emotionally as hard as those invisible bullets they shoot.",

            "content": "It's refreshing to watch a show that is not \"your typical anime\".  It has a bold concept, disregards the norms, and delivers constant action.  Boasting one of the strongest first episodes of the decade, Inuyashiki launches straight into the story and makes you wonder if this will be the next Parasyte.  Unfortunately, it is not, but simply by virtue of not being either moeblob trash or netoge cancer, it is worth viewing.  \r\nAfter the first episode, we get to witness the contrasting ways the characters deal with their new found powers.  One guy turns evil and the other guy turnsinto Jesus.  I found that the premise made sense; it's a different but justifiable way for the men to feel human.  Fundamentally, Inuyashiki is _interesting_.  Though nothing about the scenario is ground breaking, you want to know where it's going to end up.  It culminates into a frankly mediocre, predictable and cheesy ending, but it didn't bother me too much.  What may be a little more bothersome is the kind of boredom or disinterest of all the characters in the middle of these crazy events.  Perhaps this is actually how it would be in reality; people assuming \"it will never affect me personally\".  Still, the gravity of the events was not well highlighted by the characters and NPCs.  \\n\\n\r\nMost of the anime is made with 3d CG.  It's some of the better CG i've seen so far.  That weird feeling of disconnect between the 3d models and the rest of the environment isn't too strong here.  The animations are also interesting and visually exciting.  It must be said that the \"classically animated\" portions are often so bad that it's glaring.  \\n\\n\r\nIt also had other production issues, especially with the sound production and voice acting.  There is this kind of bizarre compression applied to all voice lines which causes screams and whispers to be at the exact same volume, sometimes within seconds of each other.  It makes most of the speech sound bizarre and unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, all and all it's an interesting experience.  Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but just because it's not drilling you with tropes, cliches, or fan service, it is worth a listen.  It will refresh the jaded anime viewer.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a show that started off incredibly strong. And had me hooked at episode 1. But suffers from a poor second half. I'd argue that the poor second half seeps into the first half as well. Like many of you, i was interested at the prospect of a 58 year old protagonist. At first, i was left thinking this was a poor choice. But having finished the show. I'm neither happy they did this, nor am i disappointing. What little character the protagonist had in the begin of the show, is quickly left behind. In favor of contradicting the antagonist. I feel similarly forthe antagonist as well. Although, i do favor his character over the protag. Simply because of how he's portrayed. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are done quite well. Nothing i'd write home about, but decent. With a rather dramatic build up to the ending of episode 3. Which left me physically sick. To be able to claim that from a show, is nothing less than amazing. At first, i was genuinely offended by the overly gruesome, and needless killing of the scene. And while i still think it was far to much, and crossed way over the line. I respect it for what it's attempting to do. Unfortunately, episode 3 is really the last episode of any real note. In fact, it gets to the point where the antagonist has done so many horrible things. All for the sake a shock value. That it legitimately becomes laughable. The amount of murder is a joke. The effect wears off almost instantly.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the cast, you'd be hard pressed to even remember their names. Let alone their backstories. As they are so underwhelming, and underdeveloped. That they might as well just be background actors. They are so irrelevant to the plot, that you could literally skip any scene that didn't have the protagonist, or antagonist. And you'd understand the plot just fine. Around the last couple of episodes, they begin to put more of an emphasis on the protagonist's family. But it's painfully obvious that it's just to make the ending more dramatic. And even then, they are still horribly irrelevant to any of the plot. And don't even get me started on the utterly pointless, and borderline condescending ending. I'm not going to get into detail. But you'll know exactly what i mean when you see the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, what ever good start this show may have had. It's quickly overshadowed by the poor second half. But through all of it's faults. At it's core, it's still a mindless pleasure to watch. You'll be hooked just as i was. In the end, the show is not great, or even good. But it's an immensely enjoyable, a fun show to watch. Just be prepared for that ending of episode 3.",

Honestly I don't really know how because it definitely wasn't trying to be funny.. but oh god someone found the funny bone in anime right here without knowing it!!  \r\nThis anime reminds me of a mixture of Marvel Mutant movies and McDonalds.  You watch the mutant movies to see what powers people have and how they use them.  With McDonalds you have this odd yearning to go eatall the food it has to offer even though you know it will have the result of pure remorse.  This anime was like McieDee's and X-men had a love child.  So completely bogus that it was actually kinda good.\\n\\n\r\nYou aren't watching an actual classic or masterpiece here, this is like in the genre of Lolz, turn off your brain, watch it.

            "content": "\"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\"\r\nThis review/analysis may contain some degree of \u201cSPOILER\u201d\r\n          \u201cKilling is mostly wrong and saving lives is almost always right\u201d. Moral conscience is the issue that any society try to melt the common concept into its member. While in a normal everyday life, this concept is not tested so every often. This anime use power to intensify the test in viewer.\r\n          The story in this anime is simple. Two main characters suddenly acquire the power and they use it to find the meaning of theirlife and also left us with some questions. Inuyashiki Ichirou (The old man) portrayed as an unnoticeable person in the society especially his family and eventually face with inevitable death. Shishigami Hiro (The high schooler) portrayed as a child with dysfunctional family background. The plot run its course through several incidents to point out the core concepts each of the two-character focus on.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation is acceptable with somewhat good CGI. The action is quite stunning when they have to. The sound is OK. The opening is there to prepare the audience for some action. The ending is surprisingly meaningful correlating with the struggle of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n          The character development is not focused on. A little background is showed here and their but not enough to fully explain the core personality and value of the character. We just have to accept that they became to be just because.\\n\\n\r\n          The focus of this series lies in moral challenge. It may seem weak to some because killing is almost always bad, but with the creator who has created Gantz in mind, it should be the main issue discussed. Sociopath is labeled when a person can do things morally unacceptable in the society and not recognize it as wrong. The problem is the common moral can be understood with a person with \u201ccommon life\u201d but if the person with \u201cuncommon life\u201d lead to different mindset and no one can understand them. It is quite a tragic to alienate them because all they want might be someone to understand them. I am not arguing that they are not dysfunction as a person because the majority is always win in this normal/abnormal fight, but it is the question to ponder about.\\n\\n\r\n          For Inuyashiki Ichirou, this series try to tell us that he finds content in saving lives to the extent of physically punish those who causes harm to others. From other perspective, he can not make his life meaningful in another way which he also tries all his life up to the age of 58 including family and workplace relationship. For my own opinion, this character exists as a mainstream moral answer and contrast to the main moral challenge in Shishigami Hiro.\\n\\n\r\n          For Shishigami Hiro, unlike Inuyashiki, he is young and not interested in the meaning of life as the same manner as Inuyashiki but love instead. We can see that the love in his family is complicated. The broken family is a common factor in many series made to label some character with disturbing background and it is no different here. His broken family situation is not the worst, he may live with his mother with relatively low-end quality of life but he also has a healthy relationship with his father who already has a new happy family. With so little background, we cannot know how he become to be \u201cselfish\u201d. By \u201cselfish\u201d I mean he understand the value of human life differently. He cares only those matter to him. This is why I concluded that he lacks the understanding of the concept of love. All the incident portrayed such as family situation, the love confession of Watanabe Shion and his friend Andou Naoyuki. He hungers for love but those whom he loves always betray him because they cannot accept him as he is. The things he does is logically sound but unfortunately not morally.\\n\\n\r\n          I enjoy this series to a degree. The questions and issues I sensed from the anime is interesting but the character and plot development need some improvement.\\n\\n\r\n          Thank you for reading my first review/analysis. Looking forward to more discussion. \\n\r\n          Everything is only as it is.\\n",

Inuyashiki is an action, psychological, Sci-Fi anime. The anime has two protagonists; obviously one is good and the other is evil.\r\nInuyashiki Ichirou is an old man who happens to have cancer. His family doesn't care about him anymore unlike when he was young. One day, Inuyashiki discovers that he only has a few days to live. He was going to tell his family that, but he didn't because he thought that even ifhe dies, they will not cry for his death. One night, at a nearby field Inuyashiki loses consciousness. After he gets up, he realizes that he doesn't feel pain anymore. Here, the old man discovers that he became a machine!\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have Shishigami Hiro who his past is not clear, but this person was in the same place and at the same time with the old man when they both had the incident at the field.\\n\\n\r\nThe show talks about these two people who each uses their new power to do completely two different things; one person uses his new power to save the people, and the other uses it to kill people.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the story seems so cliche to you. However, trust me, while the story advances you will have a different opinion on it. You will not be bored watching a cliche story and a cliche fight between good and evil because this anime is not only about good and evil, it's about so many things beyond that. \"We value life just because there is death\" This is one of the quotations that I took from the show which I really liked.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation in this anime were really good. I kinda liked how the show looked. But in some parts, its animation kinda reminded me of Kingdom animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Inuyashiki is a show that gives a similar yet a different experience. At first, you will say: \"Yeah, this show is about the good and evil fight. It will be so boring\" but trust me, give the show a chance, and don't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\noverall rate: 8/10\\n\r\nA good anime for those who love psychological, Sci-Fi anime shows.",

            "content": "Great Old School Story, Less So New School Visuals\r\nI was very invested in the series throughout, it's a great fun premise that has a bit of edge thrown in. There's plenty of genuinely funny and moving moments respectfully with a solid through line that leaves quite a few questions less than satisfactorily answered at the end. Voice acting and characters are quite likable and interesting, even if the motivations can seem a bit boilerplate. \r\nThe main issue I have that keeps it at a 9 out of 10 for me are the, at times, absolutely laughable CG visuals, while some of the animation and actionscenes are quite impressive, facial expressions during emotional moments were almost too funny to properly convey the tone. I get that the robot bits have a lot of moving parts, but I honestly would've preferred a more hand-drawn look, even if it meant some of the intricacies of the designs were decreased for it. Well worth the watch in my personal opinion though, especially since you don't have to double-pay for Anime Strike on Amazon anymore.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAs 2017 came to an end with the fall season, I was wondering what would be the highlight for it and just by finishing Inuyashiki, this was definitely an anime to remember especially considering it goes a bit of a different route for once with it's MC.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on Ichirou Inuyashiki, a 58 year old man, who has been neglected by his family and has been diagnosed with cancer, until one night crying on a hill he suddenly dies and is brought back as a robot and becomes an unlikely hero.\r\nNow what the story does incredibly well, is making our MClikeable and Inuyashiki is a very likeable person, despite being an old man he sees the good in people and tries his best to protect them from various threats, like troubling teens or even the Yakuza.\\n\r\nWe see his character evolve over time as he get's used to his new found powers and kick's some well deserved ass, until they introduce the villain of the show Hiro Shishigami, who also acquired the same powers as Inuyashiki.\\n\r\nNow the story does take a little bit of a turn where it starts focusing more on Hiro than it does on Inuyashiki, we see him go through multiple phases of killing people and then something big happens to him where he decides to start helping people, until the government knocks down his parade.\\n\r\nThe focus on Hiro did sorta take me out of the show a bit, because I wasn't entirely invested into his character, as a villain I was invested, but as someone going back and forth between good and bad it just didn't work for me and made the story suffer a little.\\n\r\nThen we arrive at the final episodes which were pretty spectacular as Inuyashiki and Hiro finally have their throwdown while also having Inuyashiki saving the city in a pretty badass way, but the way he was able to save his daughter just didn't seem like it would happen in real life, then the final episode has both our characters sacrificing themselves for the planet as an asteroid heads towards it and it was sad seeing Inuyashiki go out like this, but it felt fitting for his character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere's really only two characters to take note of in this anime, along with a few side characters, but they weren't really important compared to our MC's.\\n\r\nIchirou Inuyashiki was a great character, showing that you don't always need a Hormonal teenage boy to be you're main character all the time. Inuyashiki is the true definition of \"With great power comes great responsibility\" because this guy is great as a hero, he's wise and is willing to risk his own life to make sure the victim is safe, he never loses site of who he is and always see's the good in people unless they are too far gone to be redeemed. Inuyashiki is awesome definitely one of the best male characters I've seen in anime from 2017.\\n\r\nHiro Shishigami is the villain of the show, well mostly, Hiro was a really brutal character when it comes to villain standards as he would just go into random people's house's and kill them, at first I was wondering why he was doing this, but his families checkered past probably sheds some light on this matter, but when the show tries to turn into the good guy multiple times I just couldn't accept it, because of how brutal he murdered people, plus he seemed like a pretty emotionless guy until something really bad happened to him, but even when he cried it seemed emotionless.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFair warning, if you're going into this, then there will be CGI especially when Inuyashiki and Hiro show parts of their robotic selves or when their fighting, but luckily the CGI is pretty good and didn't seem too ridiculous although it was did sort of give away when our MC's were about to transform.\\n\r\nConsidering this was made by the same guy who made Gantz, this show can be pretty brutal with the way it kills people and some of these deaths were surprising to begin with, then it started getting to insane levels much like Gantz towards the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to compare the op and ed of this anime to One Punch Man, both have a kickass op, but both have a softer ed that usually has orchestral elements, except the ed here felt better than OPM, OPM's ed just didn't fit for me, but here it kinda does. The op however is great, the buildup is great and when the op really gets going it's so awesome to listen to. \\n\r\nSoundtrack wise, I can't quite remember, but the music for Inuyashiki was done well it definitely shows the hero side of him.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe action was done well and was spaced out nicely, although the battle between Inuyashiki and Hiro was pretty damn good, the highlight when it comes to the action has to go to episode 4, where Inuyashiki goes up against the Yukaza and damn was that epic. Just seeing an old man take on a bunch of dudes with guns while saving someones girlfriend and also taking out the guys without killing them was just so awesome to see.\\n\r\nThere were some good psychological moments in there too, like how Inuyashiki started out feeling unwanted by his family at the beginning and feeling like the greatest person ever to them by the end was really well done, then there is Hiro who has really disturbing problems that are most likely related to his family, since he usually goes around killing families to begin with, seeing the way his character changes was a bit mixed for me, but it wasn't stupid or bad to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a damn good anime to end the year on and shows that having an older MC is actually a good idea to have, it also felt quite impressive since this came from the guy who made Gantz and we all know how much of a trippy ride that was.",

            "content": "If there is one show that will be remembered in 2017, it would be this show,Inuyashiki. This is a show with an origin that no one known about and it looked very interesting but , OHHHH NOOOOO, MAPPA decided to vomit out everything in CG which after Berserk 2016 and 17 \r\nI was turned off as fast as my computer on 3%. But the hype for the show soon started to get bigger until my curiosity killed a cat.''\r\nLong story short,Inuyashiki is about this old guy, who is sad but he then turns into a cyborg and he does what anyone good would do butfor every action there is an equal/opposite reaction. There is another person who is similar but opposite of him and his motive.And the hype on the promo art is real.\\n\r\n-What I liked?\\n\r\n The best thing this anime does is show how people are affected by an evil motive and the miracles of how someone with abilities outside their powers lend a helping hand. Inuyashiki is such a badass and provides justice.On the other hand, the other person,Shishigami, is coldhearted and kills people for no just reason. Seeing these two use their cyborg powers(which are really cool btw) use them and affect other people. It is engaging and very intriguing\\n\\n\r\nBut then the plot just continues and the rest of the series just starts to lose a LOT of its common sense.\\n\r\nThe latter part of the show loses its engagement because some of the craziest crap happens out of no where. The two actually do fight but it lasts for like 5 seconds and then a meteor comes and .....what do you think happens after that? Because it does happen like that.Also the ending was a bit rushed , these people are crying left and right but I am just scratching my head. I was so out of it that I kinda left a bit let down.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, the show's highlights are it's shocking moments and cool moments and also that gang takeout scene was freaking amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isssssssssssssssss okay, no ,adequate. This show has the curse of not knowing what to be. It jumps from 3D to 2D which is understandable, but it can look so sloppy on both aspects. With the 3D, the techno crap is cool to be in 3D but when one thing is in 3D everything else has to be in 3D too. It can look amazing at times though. only at times. On the 2D scale (or the art style) I see where this show is going with its style, its trying to impersonate its senpai,Madhouse, by giving people these realistic character designs. It does look nice, but when some people start crying, it does look a little,for lack of a better word, \"derpy\".Also when the segments are made in 2D, the show, especially at the end, just grinds its animation budget immensely . To the point where it gets embarrassing.Really didn't help the whole feeling of the show being rushed out.Also, I don't know how most of the product placement got through production but good job.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is forgettable, I can't recall what I heard from it. The opening became a meme and one point and I see why. The op was done by Man with a Mission. It is great.I've never been hooked by their work but this is a favorite of mine from them. I almost like this song more than \"database\". ALMOST. The end theme is beautiful too and it also has beautiful animation to go along with it. I just wish the show had the luxury of that type of polish.I have to give major praise for the voice acting because it deserves critical acclaim.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGetting to the characters, my favorite is actually Inuyashiki himself. He has nothing working out for him and then suddenly he becomes a robot with the ability to save lives. And he uses it with no hesitation. He is not a grumpy old man, but just a gullible push over. He reminds me of that little kid that you don't want to see get hurt. He also has good intentions despite the fact that he is technically a murder machine. He doesn't murder anyone in the whole show. And this shows that humanity has some sense of morals.On the other hand, Shishigami came along and I could figure out what his deal is.He kills people,no matter what age,and he is more likely to cry over a copy of Shonen Jump. This is where I have a problem with how the show dealt with him.It's similar like this:Shishigami likes to steal cookies , then someone came to him and said \"no more cookies until you behave\" and so he behaves , but no matter how good he is, he still doesn't get anything and has to eat saltines, so he's like \"well fuck it\" and still cookies from his mom, and then goes to the closest convenience store and robs all the cookies, but Inuyashiki puts the cookies back.Makes sense, well no. Then there are the other characters. Inuyashiki's daughter who the show waited till the end of the show to deal with. Then we got Shishigami's friends,Andou and Watanabe. Andou is alright, he helps with things but he is only a human who loves Gantz. And Watanabe is kinda of an idiot for taking sides with a killer. She does try to change Shishigami as a human but when that doesn't work, oh well. These characters are alright but they don't really matter compared to the citizens in Japan who have to deal with the crap that Inuyashiki and Shishigami give them.So literally the show is about these two and no one else matters.The dog was cute though.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was very fun to watch, but also very graphic. Also without knowing,there were times where the show pulls heartstrings. But all logic gets thrown out the window. And there are some parts that I appreciate they have the guts to show but I could do without seeing. In the end, this should be appreciated if you are not sensitive but still have a heart or lacking common sense, and that you are at least seventeen without a faint of heart.If you don't like seeing little kids being killed, nonconsensual blowjobs, or people who read and use their freaking feet to turn the pages then stay away, but for everyone else, this show should leave you with time well spent.\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nAlso there is a cameo of Donald Trump,thought I should mention that.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

No not because it had guys who can sprout weapons and jetpacks and other weird stuff (which can be obviously called weird) but i call it weird for a different reason and that is that with every episode i watched the idea i had about the message delivered by the show changes.\r\nWas the anime trying to show the affect of gaining power can do to different people? or was it about the the definition of being alive? or was it about the effect of caring about something or someone? or was it about the purpose of ones life? ......hell i had a lot of ideas about what the show meant. It could have been all of these ideas or none of them as i always tend to overthink things :D\\n\r\nNevertheless i have enjoyed the story delivered by this anime even though i was bothered by some points in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nBoth Inuyashiki and Hiro were simple characters and i don't mean that they were shallow or bad characters it's just that there was nothing too complex about them and they were well established. Gaining the new power only helped in enforcing who they really were from the beginning.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters had a big role in shaping the main characters as well as the events of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10):\\n\r\nWhile the CG looked awesome most of the time the amount of other times where it crapped out really ruined the noticeable effort they put into it.\\n\r\nThey should have gone with \"average but stable\" instead\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (9/10):\\n\r\nLoved both the OP and the ED the rest of the OST was not bad as well\\n\r\nThe VA was not the best i have heard but it was still good i thought that the VA of the two main characters did give a proper representation of their personality.\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nIt was certainly and entertaining show and really binge worthy (clicking that next episodes button was never easier) it offered a good story and unique characters as well as some good action (that was ruined sometimes by the CG crapping out)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)",

Not because they are the greatest that have ever been, but because they had the courage to do something different. In an ocean of generic, overused and copied animes who are all variations of the same story, Inuyashiki did something different, and it did it well. \r\nYes the last episode felt extremely rushed, yes the 3d / 2.5d art-style of the action scenes was nothing impressive, but with the characters of the hero and the villain of the story Inuyashiki did something outstanding.\r\nAn old man, disappointed in himself and his life,a young student who is a textbook psychopath, both of them attain insane power at random.\\n\r\nThe villain uses this power to explore his emotions, kills people to see how it makes him feel until events get to close to him... Even though he is clearly designed as a character that has little connection to human emotions, or society, you clearly understand what he is doing. Even in his most vile moments you still feel him. This is rare. The fact alone that he is relatable even though he is not a bad representation about a psychopath deserves praise. \\n\r\nThe hero on the other hand uses his power to help people, to make up for his short comings. Without searching for attention he just wants to truly help people. He is a beautiful contrast to his younger counter part. Still, in the end of the story they find themselves in the same place, for similar reasons. This final episode feels very rushed, yet it still delivers. \\n\r\nWatch it.\\n\r\nAmong all those stories you already know, among all these characters and ideas that are used for cheap emotions and reactions, this is something original. \\n\r\nIt deserves your support.",

The only problem I have with this is the villain. I felt like the writers tried way to hard to make him \"good\". All the bad things he does, which btw are VERY BAD, and then they're like \"hey, save people and you can be a hero.\" Just make him a villain, plain and simple. Don't even get me started on the fangirls. They don't affect the anime directly but reading comments defending him, it just shows how hardthe writers tried to push this cute guy to be the one who is the victim. If they truly made Hiro, the villain, a real bad guy, I would've enjoyed this so much more. Something that could've helped is if they actually fleshed out his character. Done something to explain him. Instead all we get is \"I kill to feel human.\" It's just so boring.",

However, the ending is too rush, if it spends more scenes to talk about the asteroid, the whole anime will be more completed and smooth. I like how the story and the development of characters are syncs. However, there are some awkward moments of the change of Shishigami's personality. Essentially, those awkward parts are because of the hastiness of the ending. The voice actors in this anime are awesome, they certainly devoted themselves to make this anime excellence. \r\nOverall, it's unique anime that's definitely worthed to watch and enjoy.",

But from then on it just exist to confuse the viewer.\r\nFirst of all, there is so much coincidences throughout the story that we can just discard it. It should be reasonable if the anime doesn't focus in the story, but it's last episode shows that the story is really the focus of the entire animation. sometimes it seems to be the characters, or some implicit message, but no, it isn't. It's not like the characters are being morally tested or something like that. So, as the anime focus is the story and it is full of coincidences,i'll give it a 3.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have the art. The way that the 3D element is used on the anime is disgusting. I felt like it is entirely separate from the animation and not complementary, as it should be. The animation itself bothers me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the sound. The only good thing about the sound is the opening music because there are some terrible sound decisions made throughout the anime. Want an example? While Mr. Inuyashiki is trying to prevent a disaster, a music from comedy cartoons of, maybe, 90's or 80's starts suddenly. Why? I don't know either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHiro character is just unpredictable, that's it. His actions don't matches it's personality. Mr. Inuyashiki is very silly. Now, the other characters are just disposable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's enjoyable in the start. From the middle to the end it's just boring. I watched Inuyashiki hoping for it to be a decent psychological anime, but it seems more like a mediocre action anime full of coincidences and a little bit of protagonism for the young / adult audience. That's it.",

I feel like we needed to get some more focus on inuyashiki's family and hiro's family and that the most of the supporting characters weren't that good. overall, they are fine, but I couldn't care for them at all until the last ep, and even then not enough.

            "content": "Now this is my first rant on this website. Never thought it's going to be Inuyashiki, sadly. \r\n\"A simple show that people dug too deep into. \"\r\nNow let me clarify that I don't hate this series at first, this series had potential. It could create a lot of fucked up scenes to showcase how much of a fucked up character Hiro, our main antagonist, is. His level of insane is just straight up psychopath level, but there needs to be a limit. You know, when this kind of show didn't really gives the antagonist a motive for his action, it will just showcase how shallowof a character he is. What I mean by that is that Hiro is too goddamn overpowered and badly written. \\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler starts)\\n\\n\r\nHey you, remember the last anime about smartphone you watched, the one that aired last season that goes by the name of Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni, which is a straight up trash show btw (I still enjoyed it though), and ya the concept of smartphone in that anime is brought into this one by letting Hiro kills people through computer screens and smartphones. Seriously!? Like I know that Isekai Smartphone anime is a total joke and that I shouldn't take it seriously, but Inuyashiki...Really?\\n\\n\r\nNow talking about the characters, each character in this anime is a total dumbass. Like the one main girl that shows up in the middle of the series, who knew little to nothing about Hiro, decided to protect him from being caught by the police, even though she clearly knew that Hiro is a murderer. Now you might be saying \"Love blinds people man\" these kind of thing which I like to call BS, because why in the actual fuck do the girl likes Hiro. Hiro did nothing to her and she knows nothing about him, aside from his rather cool appearance. What triggers me more is that Hiro decided to save people because of the stupid girl. Not even his BFF can change him but a girl he knows nothing about can? Now ladies and gentleman, that's what I like to call SHIT WRITING. Furthermore, why do the characters in that world like Hiro? It makes no goddamn sense at all. Why the fuck will people like a psychopath? Why do people still not believe that Hiro can kill people through phones even though it actually happened? Are they that stupid? Is this anime even realistic? This is just becoming more like Ousama Game The Animation next door, which is complete stinky garbage btw. \\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler ends)\\n\\n\r\nTo me, and I think to EVERYONE too, the most interesting character is Inuyashiki, the old man himself. But for a main character he surely got so few screentime compared to some psychopath. I wanted to know more about him. I wanted him to get his family members acceptance. Most importantly, I wanted him to be featured more in the goddamn show that is named after him. He is what made episode 1 so great! Without him, this show is a total piece of shit! Give me back my Inuyashiki!\\n\\n\r\nNow I rarely complain about this but the OP theme, it's catchy, but oh boi do the lyrics makes no fucking sense at all. Hit me on the ground? Dafuq!? Who the heck even thought about the lyrics. I will only give the composer credits for that catchy music, not the lyrics writer. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation, is all in CG, but I will not complain about it. I am perfectly fine with CG animation and this anime did it well. Praise Studio Mappa. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. I wrote this because I can't stand people ignoring the issues which is straight up insulting to the audience. What I initially wanted is an anime with believable cast of characters and a dark psychological anime, not this kind of shit. 4/10 Total train wreck and that is a fact.  \\n",

            "content": "If Inuyashiki shines in one area, it has to be character investment.  Right from the start, the series causes you to be immediately invested in Ichiro Inuyashiki as a sympathetic figure, simply for the way he is treated by his family.  I found myself deeply rooting for good things to come his way, from the very beginning, purely out of sympathy.  Simultaneously, the show does an equally fantastic job of making the villain, Hiro, an INTENSELY unlikeable character.  And when I say \"Intensely\", I mean one of the most vile villains in the history of anime.  The kind of villainthat you eagerly await to see die a horrible death for the things that he does with a nonchalant look on his face.  But, while Hiro is really the scum of the Earth, as a human being, he is the engine that makes this anime run.  He's the type of sociopath that truly great animes need, like Yagami Light, Johann Liebert or The Fuhrer.    \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Inuyashiki is surprisingly basic: \"What do good men and evil men do with power?\".  The story of Inuyashiki watches that question get answered in the most honorable and wretched ways possible.   The story however, tends to lean more towards answering what evil men do, as Hiro gets a significant amount of screen time, more so than the titular character.  Which is perfectly fine, because I believe the anime would be a bit boring if it surrounded Inuyashiki more than Hiro.   \\n\\n\r\nBut, with these two most important aspects of anime, character and story, Inuyashiki shines with its uniqueness and surprising moments of realistic logic for a story about humans altered into ultra-destructive cyborgs.   You could tell from the beginning that this anime would go out of the realm of normal shounen fare, just by the use of a 58-year old man who looks like he's 70 as the protagonist.  \\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki is not without its flaws, as enjoyable as it is.  I have a personal saying when it comes to anime: \"It's hard to finish.\".  It seems like no matter how good the anime may be, many of them tend to stumble in the final 2-3 episodes, and Inuyashiki is no different.  In this particular case, the final episode presents a problem that just appears from out of nowhere, literally.  It's completely disjointed from the rest of the story and seems like it was just thrown in to wrap things up.  It did hurt the anime, in my opinion, and why I give it an 8 instead of a 10.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other aspects of the anime, I found they were a neutral factor.  The supporting cast consisted mainly of Andou and Shion for most of the series, until they decided to give Inuyashiki's family a bit more screen time at the end of the series, which was fine, because as a viewer, you will more than likely hate them, anyway.  Andou and Shion were really just the supporters of Inuyashiki and Hiro respectively, and didn't move the needle of the story much, one way or another.   They weren't really powerful characters like Hiro and Ichiro, and they didn't need to be.  This anime was a focus on what sudden power does to the human psyche. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great.  I am really enjoying the fact that more studios are integrating 3D animation into their artwork.  It truly makes for smoother animation, especially during fight scenes.  I believe that 3D animation is the future of anime, and for an example of that, go watch the Land of the Lustrous which is easily the most beautiful anime ever made, in my opinion.  While Inuyashiki is not nearly as beautiful as Lustrous, it still benefits from excellent animation.  Although, some work could still be done on non-combat animations, motions and facial expressions.   \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, the opener was excellent.  But, other than that, I didn't pay much attention to the music this time around.  I was too busy being focused on the insanity playing out in front of my eyes.   \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Inuyashiki is a truly high quality anime that I would recommend to anyone who is tired of the same tropes in Shounen anime these days.  It's different and remains exciting and engaging throughout.  I just really wish they had brought the anime to a well-reasoned conclusion, rather than the ending they went with.  That's my only real complaint.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "* SPOILERS *\r\nSynopsis: A family man named Inuyashiki with a huge inferiority complex, next to a teenager is killed by an unknown entity when he took his dog for a walk (the only being that seems to appreciate him). When he wakes up he discovers that his entire body has been replaced by a killer machine with technology light years away from Earth.\r\nCharacters 7/10\r\nThe only key characters in the series are inuyashiki and shishigami, the rest suffers from development although they are not all bad (Andou), rather than giving motivation to the main characters (See shion with hiro), inuyashiki has a fucking good development, atthe beginning being patetico for not being human, in the course of the series little by little there is change in the protagonist, which is shown in a meticulous way if we put ourselves in his place, of Hiro I do not have much to say, it is a complex character, In chapter 6 we are shown the cause of why his will to live is to kill people and how his children affected him when he became a machine, his development is something null but at the same time it can be understandable, Andou is the friend of childhood of this, and the truth that I liked this character, the problem is that he is the assistant of inuyashiki without more, there is no depth in it, much less, he only shows us like a gantz fan worried about his best friend.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nBeing adapted by MAPPA I expected much more, the animation suffers from a lot of CG with the protagonist duo, at the same time there is a mix with 2D that is very good, but in chapter 10 there is a great imbalance of the uses of these effects (as can be seen in the fight), and in several chapters they use too much of this poor resource in the street people, and not to mention the animation done in pencil, because it is not so bad, if the chapter 4 has an incredible scene with some errors ( for example some already had the eyes bleeding oh suddenly they forget to put more detail in the face oh hands of characters). In conclusion, sometimes the scenes in 2D are good but some that other CG gives a bad spine, more than anything depends on your level of attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and Ending are very good and represent well the series, in when the direction of music is not bad, in the conclusion of chapter 2 (when inuyashiki is with hiro) is very well directed the background song in the situation, and although in moments of the series the track is not well placed, the rest is fine, there is a piano track that I do not like at all but has its moments.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment:\\n\r\nIn the development of the series there are a few contradictions about the main character, for example in chapter 8, inuyashiki sees live as they kill millions of police while we see him frustrated by not being able to do anything (When in reality the unfortunate is at level of this killer to go to), oh when this can locate the sound of people screaming but ask where is your daughter, really? The romance of hiro and shion is unnecessary, I understand that it is to give motivation to hiro although if we remove it I doubt there is a difference, the performance of seiyuus is decent, the voice of the rhythm of moments does not square with the movement of lips of this, and the voice that interprets hiro is a little wrong in the moments when he cries, leaving aside the technical, the ending is bad (script holes, very fast and open), the development of inuyashiki and the depth of hiro are what make the show entertaining good including also moments of action and some that ot Thoughtful moment as you can see in some chapters, if it can be pretentious at times, the drama works but it is somewhat forced, the animation can not be the big thing and there are script holes from the start, however the good patch I mentioned in advance they are what makes inuyashiki last hero a good show.\\n\\n\r\nIn general:\\n\r\nI enjoy watching my favorite manga adapted, yes, it can have many errors, contradictions and low budget, and some may not like it for obvious reasons, however the series has its own, I also recommend the manga (If you want more detail regarding the technical), I give inuyashiki last hero a 7/10\\n\r\nforgive the bad english",

Inuyashiki has more disturbing characters and fiction that torture you and make you prepared for the \u201cgreat hero\u201d. Anime is great at making innocent people so innocent and evil too evil. Even if there is such exaggeration it didnt bother me because still its in acceptable level. It has some mystery about the power that our hero (grandpa) has which is also make you watch but its not the main concern in this 4 episodes. Shortlyit become too disturbing to watch but if you can endure it you will feel pleased.",

            "content": "Characters\r\nHiroya Oku\u2019s idea of having an elderly man and a young teenager as the pro and antagonist was quite interesting. The impact of the age difference on the pair\u2019s ideologies made for an interesting dynamic. For an eleven-episode series, Inuyashiki had a good amount of character development. The 58-year-old Ichiro Inuyashiki went from a man with no purpose in life to someone who\u2019s purpose is to keep others alive and the edge lord Shishigami went on a rollercoaster of change throughout the story.\r\nVisuals\r\nThe art direction of Inuyashiki is very similar to Hiroya Oku\u2019s previous works. If you were a fan of the brutally bloody scenesof \u2018Gantz\u2019 then you will not be disappointed. This Gory series is full of beautifully crafted scenes that feature a near perfect combination of CGI and traditional 2-d animation but also had a few select scenes in which the choice for CGI seemed a little odd. Despite the occasional hiccup this show still boasted some of the most visually appealing clips of the season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRating\\n\\n\r\nWith all the pre Fall 2017 Chatter being about Mahoutsukai no Yome(Ancient Magus Bride) and Black Clover, there was little to no hype surrounding Inuyashiki. The show quickly made a name for itself with its aesthetically pleasing visuals, excellent pacing, and heart wrenching ending. Inuyashiki is my personal favorite show of the Fall 2017 season and a must watch!\\n\\n\r\n872/1000 Bangs\\n",

The counterpart of him Hiro, was in my opinion perferct for the series to provide suspense throughout the series. You can really understand him pretty well, because he seems like a confused teenage boy who just did things he enjoyed or he himself liked though it was not the right thing. \r\nI like the side characters too and the cast for the voice actors are amazing in my opinion.\r\nThe end of the story was a bit rushed, maybe becauseof the length in general of this adaptation.\\n\r\nAnother point I want to mention is the animation, or the usage of CGI. I'm also not that big of a fan of CGI but I think in some parts in wich it is used to show complex machineries I think it is ok and the fighting scenes were pretty good besides it.\\n\r\nAll in all if you like your brutally death note or gantz like storys, I think you can enjoy it.\\n",

It is not the greatest but it's done its part.\r\nNothing to say much, at first I was gonna skip this show because of the CGI and the robot thing then I founded out that the story does not focus on the robotic functionality as much which is great.\r\nAnd I do feel a lot emotional moment justwent by like a breeze...should I be sad in this or that situation ...Not really, maybe because of the CGI,  maybe because I don't care enough or maybe because the whole show takes killing like it was nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI mean sure, spoiler alert a lot of people died and the family plus the surviving people are whining about stupid shit, it's just unbelievable to me to think Japanese people would be fine if this much terrorizing happening to their country.\\n\\n\r\nI mean if they're not gonna care, why should I as viewer care.\\n\r\nSo, Inuyashiki...should you watch it?\\n\r\nYeah sure, it's a 7/10 anime and they should really make a movie about it ...or did they already make one ...\\n\\n",

And killing to him was more of an emotionless thing like he never really felt anything for others, well he did but for his mum, girlfriend and best friend. \r\nBad Points: Well the CGI was kinda annoying and parts, why did they have to make the damm anime half cgi and half 2d animation. Makes no sense other thenthat it was okay. Oh i was a but upset about the ending. I like how the teenager is so evil yet you can't help rooting for him and sympathizing with him, also he is hot. XD\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The opeing was okay i liked it but can get annoying after listing to it at the start of every episode. But the ending song oh my it was beatifull. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: A very good anime and unique premise that i have seen so far.",

But apparently, that's not what the people in Inuyashiki were thinking.\r\nInuyashiki Ichiro is a middle-aged, friendless man with an uncaring family. One fateful evening, he is struck by a mysterious explosion in a public park, which is of extraterrestrial origin, and his body is replaced by an incredibly powerful, but still outwardly human, mechanical body. He quickly realizes the extent of his body's powers, and after saving a homeless man being beaten by a packof teenagers, he decides to dedicate himself to doing good, using his powers to heal those with incurable diseases and fight crime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the same man who created Gantz, so its exactly like I expected. Lots of the time, it feels forced, edgy and unnaturally. Yeah I mean I know humanity is stupid, but are they really that dumb? Many times I felt they acted like that just because the plot needs to keep moving forward. But it's not all bad and luckily its good parts are more than their bad ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is really simple and entertaining. With just 11 episodes, they did go fast-paced with lots of actions that keeps me wanting for more and not getting bored. The story gets better as the series coming to the end. That to me is its biggest strength.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is usually great with typical bright colors and detailed scenes. Even though the actions does dropped a bit but overall it looks fine. The soundtrack is on-point. I love the op.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Inuyashiki worth watching? I would say it does. It's short and fun with memorable endings. Too much to ask for a series that only has 11 episodes. So enjoy!",

I mean, it didn't end happy for the sake of trying to get a second season but considering the animation was choppy, the story made no sense, a lot of thingswent unexplained, and the characters were too miserable to pity, I would hope this doesn't get a second season. The best part about it was the opening song but honestly, I wouldn't recommend this series to anybody.",

It's refreshing to see a show that doesn't feature an androgynous \"cool-type\" or a doddering, plucky kid for a hero; instead we get a pretty average geriatric fellow that becomes extraordinary after a little alien accident. \r\nWhile the details are refreshing, I found the structure of the show equally enjoyable. Rather than a mustache-twirling antagonist pitted against the determined protagonist, it's organized in such a way that each of the main characters develop largely independent of one another... how do they develop? Well, the two cyborgs have different challenges, startingthemes, and paths of progression:\\n\\n\r\nOne starts off a bona fide loser, no sense of purpose, in an apparently loveless family situation, total despair, etc. However, there's a lot of experience at his core and when he's empowered to act on his values, he discovers his sense of self and \"what makes him human.\" He feels compelled to respond to the suffering of others and to intervene where villainy takes place (there is a tempo hiccup eventually, when the greatest villainy develops that he painfully stutters with--but I was able to forgive that given it's only 11 episodes and taking into account dramatic effect and depth of consequences).\\n\\n\r\nThe other is a jaded child dripping solipsism and sociopathic levels of apathy. He is a kid... the show does a good job of demonstrating his immaturity and what it might be like to hand a kid a rocket launcher. How does he develop? Well, the entire time I watched the show, I kept reminding myself that he's 17. Once again, what would happen if you handed a 17 year old a rocket launcher? Or maybe a better metaphor would be \"god mode\" in a video game. What do kids do when they get god mode going? They tend to be total assholes. And what happens if someone, somehow hits him emotionally during his traipse down power lane? Tantrums. Bloody tantrums, high body count. This is punctuated with flickers of his humanity and potential for good (the way this is portrayed is kind of another tempo/plot hiccup; but again, 11 episodes, dramatic effect, depth of consequences, etc. etc.); but he is consistent in his emotional ineptitude and inability for empathy and to reconcile the reality of others.\\n\\n\r\nI'm almost tempted to speculate on the themes here (ie. old vs young in place of good vs evil)... but naw. I dug the show, I like that it made me think a little, and much like Gantz, the portrayal of alien tech as it is in Inuyashiki is pretty wild.\\n\\n\r\nWithout going into any spoilers, I'd say the charm and joy of this show is its imagination, the potential anthropological jeers/queries, and commitment to its own ethos. There is no fan service to be found here...",

While the premise is great, it fails to live up to my expectations in a few ways.\r\nThe main problem I have is with the antagonist, he doesn't have any real motivation from the start, and when he develops one, it's just so weak and wierd. Honestly it could have been a whole 2 points up from 7/10 to 9/10 for me if the antagonist has more belivable.\r\nAs a character he's not bad, but he's far from great.\r\nThe \"Old guy turns super-hero\" is a very nice and fresh idea, but ultimately they squander a lotof potential. That he doesn't change in his acting in the least, only his actions, doesn't reflect human nature. Perhaps this is intentional as he is turned into a robot, but that's a hypothetical assumption at best, and is not a valid excuse for having a constant and stagnant character throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of 3D animation, I don't have a problem with it, but some people do so it's worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed watching the show and would somewhat recommend it, but don't have too high expectations.",

            "content": "Fight for the salvation of humanity or destroy it all? The only two beings who can decide the fate of the Earth are Ichiro Inuyashiki and Hiro Shishigami. MAPPA Animation Studios succeeds in bringing the action-packed manga written by Hiroya Oku to life. After being crash landed by aliens, Hiro and Inuyashiki are transformed into superhuman robots with special abilities. They have super-hearing and super-strength, as well as the ability to hack into any technological device. Hiro, uses his powers for malice and intends to rid the Earth of humans. Inuyashiki, on the other hand, aspires to save humanity. \r\nInuyashiki is definitely one of thetop anime of 2017. With a catchy opening and ending, it entertains viewers from beginning to end, and although sad and emotional at times, the story is well developed. The main characters are opposites of one another in both age and ambitions, but successfully balance each other out. The supporting characters are somber despite greatly influencing the heroines\u2019 actions.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, Inuyashiki provides explicit visual content. Gore and nudity are very prominent within all eleven, 24 minute episodes.  Profanity is commonly used as well to express characters emotions and feelings. Watching this anime with friends who enjoy supernatural occurrences is highly recommended. Discussing theories with like minded people is the most appropriate course of action, fore this anime isn\u2019t something to watch whilst eating popcorn with family members. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Inuyashiki is a four and a half out of five stars. The ending can somewhat be predicted, but only within the last episode, yet it still remains suspenseful. Each episode is visually appealing and keeps viewers coming back for more. For those who watched as it was airing, the week long wait was worth it! \\n",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is another not so rare example of an anime with a lot of wasted potential. Two men turned into robots on accident by some super advanced aliens, the premise isn't too sophisticated but the conflicting personalities of two main characters creates a classic hero vs anti-hero dynamic and could've turned out to be a really cool action show if it wasn't made so poorly. \r\nAlso a small disclaimer that this is an anime review, not adaptation review. I'm not gonna be taking manga into account and judge Inuyashiki solely on how well it stands on its own.\r\nStory: two men turn into robots by afreak accident, one of them is doing bad things, other one is doing good things. That's it, I know reducing plot to it's very basis is usually a trick to try and make it seem bad and stupid but Iuyashiki seriously doesn't have anything going for it in the story department. Overall you have the main conflict that usually slowly escalates with every episode as both characters learn what their body is capable of which makes their actions escalate to a new level. There are a few more nuanced moments where they try to remedy the villain but it's so short-lived and insignificant that it's not even worth mentioning. I feel like this stuff worked better in a manga where it didn't zoom past the reader in a few minutes.\\n\r\nOn the side you have the more personal life of both Inuyashiki and Shishigami. Story of Ichiro mostly revolves around realizing his own value as a person and achieving happiness and respect through helping others. Hiro is more complicated cause there's more nuance to his perception of value of life and along the course of the show he undergoes a brief change of character when he understands how harmful his actions were to people he loves despite his belief of what's good or bad being based around whether or not it harms people who matter to him. However, the show goes by so fast that none of this got a satisfying development of effect on the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is where a major disappointment lies because if the show at least had killer visuals then weak storytelling could be forgiven and I could at least recommend this as a fun little action flick. Elephant in the room for a lot of people will be the use of 3D. Most of the time when characters turn into robots it's a full on 3D territory and not good 3D either. It's very stiff looking and they animate it on twos as if it was traditional animation and that doesn't work with 3D, at all, it looks stiff and jittery, I wish anime studios would realize this. So, whenever there's an action scene with robots in it there's sure as hell gonna be pretty wonky 3D involved, the effects are fine for the most part but it's no excuse. \\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning cause damn is it distracting, is that the show slowly starts looking worse and worse past half-way through and that applies both to 3D that starts missing some shading and effects so you get scenes that look like something from PS2\\XBOX era, and I'm not really exaggerating here. 3D robots fly through badly modeled city with low res textures and fire thin white lines at each other that result in explosions of orange and black balls that clip through each other; and it applies to a lesser extent to 2D so you get really janky looking drawings that make it clear that they didn't seem to have time to correct the drawings and with the pretty detailed character designs these flaws are very jarring.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I already forgot what the music in the show sounds like, I'll gotta go listen to it again. Ok yeah no wonder I forgot it that's some generic garbage. At least the OP is kinda catchy and ED is okay.\\n\\n\r\nFun factor: it's kinda fun at first but do you want to sit through a few decent episodes only to see it turn to shit? I will guess not.",

Hiro tries to use his power proactively and, lacking empathy for people who he has no bond with, he does not see them as peers and learns the consequences of abusing his power with no reason. \r\nThe lack of evaluation from both characters on choosing who to hurt or save  could have been explored a lot more.\r\nAlso, Andou and Inuyashiki's family, all supporting cast really,are sketchy and it's hard to feel for them.",

            "content": "Inside are spoilers, proceed with caution.\r\nInuyashiki was one of those random anime shows that I picked up this season. It took my interest with the main character being a father at the age of fifty but looking my grandpa while he was in his late eighties. The premise that an old man turned into a robot with alien technology would be a vigilante and gets off to helping other people out had enough head scratching to keep me interested throughout the series. However, the longer the show went on, the more of a chore it was to watch it...\r\nBase Summary: In the show you havetwo people/cyborgs: Inuyashiki and Shishigami. Both of them are turned into robots or cyborgs in a miracle of a ufo crash in a park. The results are that the aliens rebuild these two people with their technology and they carry out their lives running on water. However, neither of them feel like people anymore unless you are either killing people (Shishigami) or helping people (Inuyashiki). With that being said the reasoning for their actions being that it makes them feel alive seems like an okay premise, but as you get farther into the show it loses all merit. Obviously the show takes a turn where it turns into good vs evil with the two robot people, but it does so in such a slow way for a season with only eleven episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo here are the problems I have with the show. The art... Anytime they use the interior parts of their bodies they used this ungodly CGI to show it. It looks out of place, it makes you feel as safe as a passenger with a blind driver, it's awful. Anytime there is fighting or anything \"cool\" in this show the CGI ruins it. I would have taken people using paint to animate this over the CGI. \\n\r\nNext up, the character progression. Since there was only eleven episodes I really didn't expect much to change....  but then at the very beginning there is this heartwarming moment when Inuyashiki is told that he is going to die and it struck me. Looking back at it, it might have been the best moment in the anime for feels. Because of this my expectations were raised a little bit, but as I said earlier it became \"I do stuff because I'm good\" and \"I'm bad, I do bad things bangbangbang\". Nothing changes in the characters too much after the first episode or two, and after a while they just turn stale. \\n\r\nLastly, the show did absolutely nothing to explain.. well anything. Like how does the science work behind Shishigami killing people by making gun sounds and imitating guns shooting? Why did the UFO crash? How does no one notice a flying grandpa? How does any of the technology work? If they can destroy the earth, how come Shishigami fails blow up/move the asteroid? HOW DO THE ALIENS HAVE ALL THIS COOL AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY BUT STILL USE USB 2.0 PORTS? Questions like this are what really did the show in for me, with literally no explanation for anything that happens besides \"aliens replaced us with robot parts\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn't a show I would really recommend unless you are one of those people that likes bad films for the memes. It had promise but failed to deliver on everything to make it a good anime and just turned into this pile of \"meh\". You know it's like my father told me \"If you set your goals low enough you will always achieve them.\". I give Inyuasha a 6/10.\\n",

It's in the next episode that we learn more about the antagonist, Hiro Shishigami.\r\nThe personality of each character is really memorable. I watched Gantz through and while it was enjoyable and really touched on the morals of humanity, Inuyashiki takes it to another level. Almost to a preachy amount. But what it does make theviewers think about is what makes someone a hero.\\n\r\nI also really liked the character development. While it lacked in some instances with Hiro, the characters of Inuyashiki, Mari, and Ando were really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe downfall is definitely the amount of episodes for such a story. 11 episodes? What anime nowadays has 11 episodes? (atleast give em 12, jesus)\\n\r\nSo the ending was very abrupt. I also had a problem with the lack of a final battle.

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nHere's a quasi masterpiece that unfortunately ended in a very rushed and disappointing way.\r\nThis is one of the most mature and promising anime of 2017. A very deep poignant initial setting, that turns into an all-in combination of many, many genres (action, drama, psychological, gore, sci-fi + school-life & humor). So far so good. \r\nWhere Inuyashiki fell short, is in its couple inconsistencies in the way in which the story was being presented. Just a few frustrating aspects in the way certain characters were reacting to the happenings. \r\nOne such glaring example was the way in which Andou started crying like alittle bitch when learning of Hiro's suicide to save mankind. This is months after losing his friend, after he's killed hundreds of people. The reaction was just... vain. Laughable at best. Definitely not sad. Certainly not congruent.\\n\\n\r\nI've overall loved this anime up until the very last episode. The inconsistencies, coupled with the very, very rushed ending, left me with a feeling of void. I was left mildly annoyed. Not sad about the story, or the characters, or their future to come. Not wondering what was next. Not hoping for more. Just slightly bummed. This is apparently derived from a manga with many chapters. I'm left wondering if 11 episodes might not have simply been much too short for the content.\\n\\n\r\nWith a story so unique, so intense, starting on such a high note, so well drawn, with such well placed CGI, delving into such deep subjects.. let's just say I was expecting a near masterpiece, if not one altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThis unfortunately isn't it, but if you can get passed imperfection, then this is absolutely worth watching.",

This review will be divided into different categories where I will highlight the positive (+) and negatives (-) of different sections in this anime. There are some spoilers but I try to keep it moderate. \r\nSTORY\r\n+ The tale of an elderly man who has become disconnected from his family and dying of cancer. Fortunately, after a strange accident, he is turned into a robot by aliens and use his new body to become a superhero.   \r\n+ Includes interesting comments oninternet culture and modern society.\\n\r\n+ Most episodes begin with a strong hook and ends with a strong cliff-hanger.\\n\r\n+ Truly terrifying and unpredictable villain which poses a real threat to the world\\n\r\n+ Efficient storytelling with subtlety \\n\r\n+ A lot of spectacular and intense moments (Some can be really disturbing)\\n\r\n+ Lots of emotional, heartfelt moments \\n\r\n- Disappointing and rushed ending to a great anime.\\n\r\n- Too much focus on the villain and not enough on the hero and his relationship with his family\\n\r\n-  Aliens are never mentioned again in the story after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\n+ Elderly man as a protagonist and superhero\\n\r\n+Surprising goal for the protagonist daughter Mari\\n\r\n+ Terrifying villain who can't be assigned a clear motive and is totally unpredictable. \\n\r\n+ Brief introduction and development of victim of an upcoming crime\\n\r\n- Lack of deeper exploration of the problems which may have disconnected Inuyashki from his family\\n\r\n- Romantic relation between Villain and a girl needed to be fleshed out more\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\n+ CGI blends well with background art well in the early part of the show\\n\r\n+ Greatly detailed 3d models for the mechanical bodies of the hero and the villain\\n\r\n+ Sound effects are pretty consistent and well designed\\n\r\n+ Solid voice acting which really shows the character emotions\\n\r\n+Variety of soundtracks to matches the slice of life, thriller, drama and sci-fi elements of the story.\\n\r\n+ Meaningful ending song which message is revealed at the end of the last episode of the anime\\n\r\n- CGI quality is inconsistent and can be bad in certain episodes\\n\r\nDespite it problem I really enjoyed this anime and also the original manga. It personally my favorite of this year and one of the best anime I have watched in a long time. I really wish the editors hadn\u2019t pressured the manga author to rush and finish his manga because it wasn\u2019t selling well in Japan. If Hiroya Oku had been allowed to completely realize his vision for this story I think it could have been a masterpiece. \\n",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is a sci-fi anime series that adapts a manga with the same name, which was written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku; who is also the original creator of Gantz. The anime focuses on the two individuals: Shishigami Hiro and Inuyashiki Ichirou. Although, very different, the two gained the same powers, with which they are now able to not only destroy Japan but also the whole world. The question; however, is that how these two are going to use these super powers? \r\nAnyway, Inuyashiki is, indeed, a better version of Gantz. Yet, if you have never heard of Gantz, or if you do not wantto watch this anime only because of the fact that Gantz was too much for you, do not jump to any unnecessary conclusions yet. As a fan of Gantz there is a 90% chance that you will highly appreciate this series, because sometimes Inuyashiki is just too realistic, but later about that. For those who have never heard of Gantz, you are in a better position. I do not have to explain you anything.\\n\\n\r\nInuyashiki Ichirou is a living embodiment of misfortune: he is only 58 years old, but he looks like he is actually 70 something years old. He earns money for his family and tries not to be a burden for his family, at the same time his family sees him only as a source of money. In addition to this, the main protagonist of the series finds out that he has cancer at an incurable stage. Having heard the news, Ichirou heads back home to explain the whole situation to his family and when he is about to engage in this rather tragic conversation with his family, he understands that his family does not care. Can it even become worse now? And the answer is yes. Ichirou goes for a walk with his only true friend, his dog. Being in the position where no one actually cares about you, the man speaks with his fluffy buddy, which is the only living being that he can talk to. Suddenly, Inuyashiki Ichirou notices a young man standing nearby. A strong blinding light in the night sky strikes the earth where Ichirou and the young man stand. He later wakes up to find out that he is no longer ill and that his body is now something that can either save, or destroy the world. How the new superhero is going to use that power? And what is he now? \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of Hiroya Oku sensei, I am sure that you will give this series a try. The main thing I have to say is that this show is very similar to Gantz, but at the same time they both are very different. Inuyashiki is a more realistic series that focuses on the life of the real human beings: their personalities, their fears, and desires are all realistic. Of course, Inuyashiki focuses on science fiction, but at the same time it is something that might be real in 20 something years. However, if you have no idea what Gantz is, or if you are a big hater of this title, I highly recommend you to give Inuyashiki a shot: it is a mature superhero story that has a nice Texhnolyze, Gungrave, Serial Experiments Lain and Ergo Proxy vibe to it. Though, the story does not give a comprehensible explanation on the nature of the superpowers, it still offers the viewer superb story development. Note: the show does explain it, but does it indirectly; I am not going to do the thinkings for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, you should definitely find the biggest TV in your apartment and watch this series on it; that is what I did. The animation is simply splendid. Only after watching the opening you want to watch more and more of it; it is too realistic sometimes. Character designs, background, and action scenes are amazing, too. The only problem; however, is that the anime sometimes uses the Berserk (2016)-like CGI that hurts your eyes. But it is not a bid deal, since it is only used for unnecessary scenes. Sound wise, the anime has some good opening and ending themes, as well as a nice OST. The bad thing; however, is that there should have been more tracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters wise, it is where the show truly shines. Shishigami Hiro is the exact antithesis of Inuyashiki Ichirou. Though, their fate is quite similar, they are two very different individuals that have different understanding of how they are supposed to use their superpower. The two protagonists receive the same amount of development, which will help you to better understand their characters, their actions, and what is important for them. The supporting cast; however, could have received a better development, but it is also not that important, since they are not the main focus of this series. \\n\\n\r\nCriticism. First, it is way too predictable. Sometimes it is just too obvious to predict what is about to happen. Not most of the times, but sometimes you just want a show to be more unpredictable. Second, it is too realistic and sometimes too emotional. The author complements the author of One Piece in his show and perhaps Hiroya Oku wanted to make his anime somewhat similar to One Piece in its depiction of emotions. It is also sometimes too disturbing: rape, drugs, and deaths following one after another, so it might be a problem for those who are too sensitive, and it is definitely not a show to watch with your younger brother, or sister. However, if you are a fan of a more mature content: an awesome drama with some superb sci-fi elements, I am sure that this show will not leave you unimpressed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) \\n\r\nThat said, not flawless, but still a very enjoyable show. If you believe that you are mature viewer, I guess that you will find this show enjoyable. It does have a very slow start, but when you realize that you are watching the final episode, you just do not want it to end. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost forgot, there is also Donald Trump.",

            "content": "I honestly didn't know what to expect after I watched a preview of episode 2 of Inuyashiki on my phone. It intrigued me. Stunned and shocked me. \"I haven't watched something so mentally deranged in a minute\", I thought to myself as I started the series. And as I write this down, I have to say that Inuyashiki has creeped its way into my top 5 list of anime of 2017. The way everything is set up is so good, as I'm about to try to explain.\r\nTHE STORY: 10\r\nThe story, while simple, was extremely easy to follow. There were no crazy plot twists or anythingof the sort, but each minute of this show always had you wondering what in the world is gonna happen next? It had you on your toes 90% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART: 7\\n\\n\r\nCG still has a ways to go, and Inuyashiki shows that. It uses a mix of regular animation and CG, and while the CG wasn't too terrible, it just seemed out of place in most scenes. Other then that small gripe, the animation is pretty good. The emotion of the characters in scenes is what really got to me at times. The show is filled with colorful displays of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show was good. The standout in this are the VAs. The VAs did an excellent job of portraying their characters emotions to the fullest. Like I said before, this show is filled with emotion. There is not a dull moment in this show. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in this show are incredible. The contrast of Ichiro Inuyashiki, the protaganist, and Hiro Shishigami, the antagonist, is very prevalent in the show. But what makes this show so great is, and I can't stress this enough, the EMOTION. At one point in the series, I felt extremely bad for Shishigami. At one point I was rooting for him! Not because of the acts he commited but how he tried to... I don't want to spoil this. The cast of supporting characters is also great. Everyone in this show has a personality, down to even the most minor of characters. I'm looking at you, Donald Trump.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I put this at 8 is due to the CGI breaking the immersion of the show at crucial moments, killing some extremely good scenes. \\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a show with shock value, e m o t i o n, good voice acting, with a little bit of shit CGI thrown into the mix, then Inuyashiki is the show for you.",

It has its huge amount of coolness and its low amounts of garbage content being shown to us. 11 episodes only, and its done. Its about an old guy who develops powers and becomes a robot killing machine, but instead he becomes a good old guy who saves people and he's just flat out amazing. Great for him. \r\nBut, the anime isn't just Mr. Inuyashiki being all good and godlike. Nah. There's an antagonist, The same as him but actually a fucking psycho. A teenager named Hiro Shishigami. Their character development is over-the-top thatyou'll definitely know them easily. But, the thing with this anime is that almost everyone has really great character development. Well. Everyone that matters. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a kid/teen/adult/I dont care how old you are, then you should watch this anime. Its honestly extremely cool. I mean. The guy shoots people with his hands saying \"Bang!\" come on thats. No. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also extremely likable, the story revolves around the people who matter a lot greatly. There's always something happening that just occupies every scene of the anime. There's no garbage time in the anime. It never really gets boring with all the stuff happening.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a lot if its fair share when it comes to action since. Its an action anime. But, it also has some really good drama that could make you shed a tear or actually make you roll on the floor like a little baby crying over the sad shit. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unrealistic, of course, its sci-fi. But, its so goddamn cool what they do. They got powers, ayt cool. But, their powers are too powerful and its just gonna blow you up and shit. Honestly, if you finish watching some eps, you'll get so hooked to it that when you take a shower, you could even act like Hiro with all the gun shit. It has a lot of violence, but like. Who cares, the violence makes it better to be honest, adds more realness into it, its goodshit. \\n\\n\r\nAnime is straight-up great, gets you hooked to it, has an amazing story, has great character development, got some laughs, hypes you up, and it guarantees your enjoyment. Honestly, what more do you need in an anime?\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers Below*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n**************************************************************\\n\r\nIt doesn't get a 10 because the ending isn't as good as you think it would be considering that the whole anime was great and you wouldn't expect something like that to happen, and it just feels kinda forced and just takes away the shit that happened because yeah. Honestly, makes you say. \"Um. Ayt, thats bullshit. Why.\"",

            "content": "Inuyashiki has ended after 11 episodes. It was a wonderful concept, with an only decent execution. The show is about an old man named Inuyashiki who after being told of numerous medical conditions, cancer being one of them, is predicted by doctors do die after 3 months. The same day he got the bad news he gets hit by an alien spaceship. The aliens then replace Inuyashiki's now dead body with a robotic weapon unit body. This gives him extraordinary powers, which saves his life, then he goes to save multiple people. Little did he know, there was another person who also had their bodyreplaced, and who has the same powers as Inuyashiki. I love this show, there are lots of interesting concepts having to do with strength and redemption. Most of not all of the action scenes were amazing. The art and music was outstanding as well, art comparable to that of parasyte, and with the OP and ED some of the best I've seen this season. Unfortunately, there are some downsides that might be a deal breaker for people that are skeptical of this show. The first and most obvious is the animations during the scenes where they are revealed to be robotic. There is some very off putting CG during those scenes, its quite a view. You get used to it and start to enjoy it though. Also, most of the characters that are not the protagonist or the main villain are bland with bad dialogue. Also also, the show goes by quickly, although, I didn't think it as a problem when I watched it. The ending is also anti-climactic, which was upsetting. Although, the force of the MC and villain throughout the show counter most of this out. I still enjoyed my time with this show. I give this show a 9 out of 10. I can recommend this to anyone who is willing to overlook the bad things about the show. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Inuyashiki.",

            "content": "Inuyashiki is an epic series with action, good characters, an interesting conflict, good ost, and a different plot, but as it has its good shit, it also has its flaws, starting with:\r\n-CG-I don't fucking care about animation-The changes between 3d and 2d are emotion killers, when you get to them you know you are going to get a bad action scene with a crappy robot transformation, they hurt a lot knowing they could animate the epic events happennig in a much better way, also, they are kinda badly directed, so yeah, I saw some parts that got me thinking \"what was the storyboard artist smokingright here,? like, give me some of that shit\".\\n\\n\r\n-Gattah goh fas'-The pacing is pretty off, sometimes you get a full episode on a non important episodical-kind yakuza shit case, and others you get like a complete volume on one episode, cutting the development in more than halfs.\\n\r\nNot that it is that notable, I really liked what they did in its 11 episode length, but I wished we got more of some minor characters, specially Andou, and Ichiro and Hiro's families, not that I didn't like their episodes, but you get me.\\n\\n\r\n-Society is a bitch-Sure the author is trying to say people are shit, but like, no caring for the fucking asteroid and for this psycho killing all the goddamn cops from japan and also with smartphones and from TV is passing from the point of criticism, but that just bothers me a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, I really liked the story, it kept me interested for this 11 weeks, making me feel sympathy for someone as stupidly crazy as Hiro, and also feel Inuyashiki's desire to use his powers the best way possible to feel human, because that's what I thought was what the series was ultimately about, what makes you feel human? Right now, with your full body, with your human shit inside, with your organs working, not being a god, but the littlest and most \"miserable little pile of secrets\", what is your meaning of being alive? our mind is a laberynth of the shittiest things even creation couldn't imagine, what is your way out of there? Your way of enjoying this short life? This thoughts, this kind of things are what make me think of Inuyashiki as a seriously flawed perfect anime.\\n\r\nOverall, just watch this, liking it or not, you'll feel something, I can almost undoubtedly affirm.\\n",

Id say at least watch three episodes and keep watching if you like it.\r\nLong review: When I hear the word anime I tend to think colorful art, weird but compelling stories, and awesome eye catching action. Of course this is not all anime but, it is definitely Inuyashiki. The story in this show is weird but not in a bad way. Going episode by episode it definitely kept my attention to say the least. I ended up watching the whole anime in just an afternoon. This is one of those shows thateach episode leaves you with wanting more. The story wasn't perfect but it was very far from bad. The story of Inuyashiki definitely stands out from all the other anime I have watched not just this season but all anime I've watched. The art in this show was good. It was not amazing but it was good. It was pleasing to look at and that is all I can ask for. I have never been too much of a fan of CG in anime but it was not bad at all in this show. That is saying a lot since honestly CG in most anime tends to turn me off from the show. When it comes to the sound I don't really remember any specific song or music sticking out to me but I do remember enjoying the music overall. The sound did its job to keep my eyes on the screen and my butt on the edge of my seat. The characters. Oh the characters. I want to start by saying I enjoyed every character for the most part but, the main character (the old man) was badass. I very much enjoyed pretty much every single scene with the old man in it. He felt like such a realistic character. The villain of the show was also very good. So in the end I very much enjoyed watching this anime and I would recommend it to anyone that wants a dramatic, action anime. I am not done watching the anime of this season but as of right now Inuyashiki is my favorite of this season.",

            "content": "This review contains some spoilers.\r\nInuyashiki is a bad show, maybe even a terrible show. However, I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy watching this series to some extent, though probably not for the reasons the author intended. The story relies on too many coincidences and things that are never explained properly if at all, the animation is dreadful, the way the characters act and the decisions they make are incredibly inconsistent, unrelateable, devoid of all logic, and even hilariously incompetent. \r\nThis show's story can be described as just a string of coincidences and bad decisions. It begins when the two maincharacters, Inuyashiki and Hiro, receive magical powers from space aliens. They aren't actually canonically magical powers since their bodies are replaced by indestructible robot bodies with an innumerable amount of weapons and hacking technology at their disposal, but seeing how the show never makes any effort to actually explain how the weapons or the bodies actually work (aside from just saying water is the only fuel they need), the main characters' abilities can be assumed to be magical or simply anything that the writer needs in order to advance the story. You would also expect the aliens that give the main characters their new abilities to have at least something to do with the story, or at least to show up again at some point. Well,the very reason why the story even happens at all are never mentioned again, and never have anything else to do in the entire series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nInstead of focusing on something a bit more interesting like say, aliens with technology so advanced they can recreate a human using indestructible technology, most of the rest of the show is centered around the main villain(?) Hiro. Yes, the story isn't even mostly about the titular character who has a more interesting backstory and is more relateable, but it's about the most stupid character in the entire series. Hiro is, simply put, a horribly written character. He starts as a \"normal\" high school student who after receiving his new powers discovers that the only way he can feel alive is by killing people. Except that after a while he feels like he should stop killing people, but wait, not a scene later he's killing more people, and... no wait, now he doesn't want to kill people anymore and... Oops, I guess now he's killing even more people and... oh he just saved the earth, oh well. These changes in a character's motivation wouldn't seem so misguided in a much longer series, but with only 11 episodes, and seeing how they can be avoided by Hiro simply moving away, or you know, by him not being a mass murderer, it feels like the author is just trying to make a \"complex\" character who I believe you are supposed to either identify with or feel sorry for, but failing miserably.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction in this show is so bad it actually comes around and coupled with the terrible writing, makes the series nearly unintentionally become a comedy. The series uses a mix between traditional and CGI 3D animation, but aside from the very few action scenes and when machinery is shown, both kinds of animation are used interchangeably. The problem with the art direction doesn't come from the usual QUALITY poorly drawn scenes, but from the very awful CGI that is used throughout the series. Since they seem to randomly swap from 2D to 3D regardless of the type of scene, character movement looks very unnatural most of the time. When you are getting used to one kind of animation, they change it and it feels unnatural again. The quality of the 3D animation in general is well, terrible. In fact, the most noticeably bad animation sequence in the series is what is supposed to be the decisive battle between the two main characters and what you would expect to be where the most effort is put; the quality of the building textures, the explosions, and the characters in that sequence makes it look like a cutscene from a very bad videogame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven the incidental music sometimes feels either out of place, or in the case of a \"sad\" piano piece that plays in serious moments, melodramatic. Another piece that sounds like something you would hear during a Bugs Bunny cartoon plays during various supposedly serious scenes, for example when Inuyashiki has to save a plane from crashing, since the situation is already ridiculous, it makes taking the show seriously even harder. But well, at least the song that plays during the OP is catchy as hell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you look at the MAL genre tags for this show (Action, Drama, Psychological, Sci-Fi), this show fails to make a good show for all of those genres. \\n\r\nThe action scenes happen too sporadically, and when they do happen they are not exciting because the main characters are literally indestructible by; the only time when a fight is interesting is when the two robots fight each other, but that sequence is affected greatly by how terrible the animation in it is. \\n\r\nThe dramatic scenes only work when they happen to Inuyashiki, but unfortunately by having most of them happen to Hiro, the most unlikable character in the show, you end up feeling he deserves everything bad that happens to him instead of feeling sorry or sad. \\n\r\nIn order to call it a good psychological show, we would need to understand why Hiro does everything he does, but his characterization is so inconsistent that he ends up contradicting himself many times during the show's measly 11 episode run. \\n\r\nFinally, it's not even a decent Sci-Fi story; the technology behind the robots is never actually explained nor do they say how they pull some of the things they do off (e.g. How do you kill people with a magical \"handgun\" through computer and phone screens), good Sci-Fi is not just saying \"it's magical alien technology, just roll with it\". The biggest Sci-Fi plot elements that happen during the show feel like both an excuse to set everything in motion, and an excuse to have a rushed half-assed \"emotional\" ending. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned at the beginning of this review that I had enjoyed the show to some extent, and that is because it feels more like a comedy at times than what it really is supposed to be . The amount of ridiculous things that happen during some parts of the show might be enough to make you keep watching just to see how much dumber it can get, and in fact I believe that by not taking it seriously you can actually enjoy this show by laughing at how incompetent it is and because of the amount of ridiculous things that happen in it. If this show is supposed to be some sort of comedy or satire then I would probably say it was effective at what it was trying to do. However, there's no indication that was the case so I can just say this is a very clumsy and messy trainwreck.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

I kept thinking the whole time: \"What is he going to do?\" \"I want to see more of him\" \"I want the citizens to notice him so bad.\" Thoughts like that made me enjoy the anime more and more. Ihonestly love the kind hearted old man, who finally found his purpose in life oh my god.\\n\\n\r\nOf course there were also characters I detested like the villian (I'm so bad with names) and that naive girl.

            "content": "Obligatory this is my first review.\r\nSTORY: 9/10 \u2013 Great;\r\nLike I said this is one of the best shows this season. Every minute of each episode is exciting and they really make you love the old man Mr. Inuyashiki and hate the young man Hiro Shishigami. It\u2019s definitely Seinen action with realistic depictions of actual crimes to the point where it can get downright disturbing beyond the blood and gore in the murder scenes. All of it feels very real and down to earth as if it really occurred in Japan, while still making the outrageousness of these two cyborg characters. It also does a verygood job of transitioning from the life of Mr. Inuyashiki and Hiro Shishigami really well throughout each episode. Overall I give it the score above because I cannot wait to watch this show every week and although it\u2019s not my favorite show or the most profound story I\u2019ve ever seen, it still is a great story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10 \u2013 Very Good;\\n\\n\r\nLike I said in the story section, the two main characters are very well developed and introduced, however I feel like some of the characters are missing some central development. Many of the characters who are murdered by Hiro Shishigami are underdeveloped which makes it harder to relate to the attacks that are taking place, however they do very nicely portray the people being murdered as normal people with normal lives. Even if some of them are stereotyped representations, (one of them is a fat dude who browses 2chan,) they are still brought forth in a realistic fashion and you do feel bad when they are killed. But apart from side characters being a little more ignored, it is really good character writing and development. So that is why I give it the score above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART AND ANIMATION: 6/10 \u2013 Fine;\\n\\n\r\nThis show really does good character designs, even at times reminding me of shows like Death Note. However this show relies on CGI way too heavily when going through the cyborg scenes. And although the CGI at times is really nicely done and conveys the characters\u2019 emotions well, it sticks out and doesn\u2019t blend very well with the rest of the world. The fight scenes however are on-point with my favorite being Mr. Inuyashiki\u2019s run in with the Yakuza at their hideout. Overall it\u2019s good when it\u2019s a normal scene but the CGI is too overused and that rubs me sort of the wrong way at times. So that is why I give it the score above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10 \u2013 Average;\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is really nice and it\u2019s one of the OPs I actually listen to the entire duration of because it is really nice. And while the songs fit the scenarios, the music is pretty forgettable and doesn\u2019t linger in my head hours after I watch the show. Which is alright since it IS just a Seinen action show, but nonetheless it is why I gave it the score above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10 \u2013 Good;\\n\\n\r\nLike I said I am eager to come back every week to tune into this show. It\u2019s one of the best shows this season and I look forward to more episodes releasing. (There are only 5 left until the finale.) I totally recommend it to people looking for a gory action show while at the same time having engaging likable (or hatable) characters that live in a very realistic Japan. It\u2019s nothing too special and isn\u2019t for everyone, but I do recommend you give it a watch. The only reason I don\u2019t give it higher is because some of the murder scenes aren\u2019t the most enjoyable personally, so that is why I give it the score I did above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10 \u2013 Very Good;\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no masterpiece by any means but is a really compelling violent edgy lol mature drama show. I think people who like shows like Attack on Titan and Death Note and similar shows will like this one and, as a fan of Shounen/Seinen action myself, this one was a really good one. Each story is very memorable, the characters are pretty believable but sometimes they are a bit stereotypical and trope-y, but overall it\u2019s an exciting show with a live action movie coming out next year (looking forward to that one). All of the things I have listed is why I give it the score above.",

After learning what he's become, he decides to use his new body for good to continue feeling human. However, he soon discovers the other young man Hiro Shishigami who also got caught up in the crash, uses the new body for more selfish purposes, terrorisingthe city to feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gets off to a very depressing start and doesn't waste any time in showing the dark ugly side of humans. It's also gruesome, filled with gore and there are always just sudden moments of surprises that might make you jump. Kind of like Gantz and indeed, the story is written by the very same person Hiroya Oku. Hell, they even have posters of Gantz in the show even though it's not by the same studio, lol.\\n\\n\r\nI kind of laughed at the panicking aliens part and thought, \"What the heck?\" It's... kind of like a dark comedy at the same time as it is sci-fi action because of the really silly direction and jokes like this during inappropriate situations. Eventually you do kind of root for Ichiro doing the best he can to make good use of the alien technology which leads to some moving moments despite the silliness and dark humour.\\n\\n\r\nVisually the studio kind of juggles between 3D/2D animation and it shows. It's not completely seamless so it kind of deters from the overall quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNot a show you'd want to watch if you don't like dark, gorey shows with an equal sense of dark humour. It is not a happy show with all its senseless slaughter and casual references to terminal illnesses. Or you could just watch it for the silliness.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE\r\nStory :\r\nThe story of this anime is a simple one. Two people of a different nature obtain God-like powers - healing, bullet immunity, flying and so forth. What are they going to do with those powers shapes the story. It's generally a breath of fresh air in a time where a good chunk tend to be quite similar and tedious to watch. \r\nThe pacing of the story is good, I felt quite thrilled the day the anime was out - this doesn't happen very often - and the episodes were generally well thought out.\r\nIt has some surprisingly good comedic scenesand dramatic ones which make the anime enjoyable and help to break the pace from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe involvement of a public political figure in the anime was quite questionable, I cannot seem to understand why that was there, it was by no means funny. Do get me back on that, I'm quite interested to know the reason for it if you've finished watching it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : \\n\\n\r\nArtstyle was good, at times a bit too clunky, especially when the characters were showing dismay, or crying. I suppose it is realistic enough to fit in well with the times, though of course there are anime studios that have done better in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one scene in particular where the explosions are quite terrible. I'm not sure what happened there, but it felt disjointed from the rest of the anime, almost as if it was rushed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound : \\n\\n\r\nOutstanding OP, a favorite of mine this year along with Land of the Lustrous and Dragon Ball. I wouldn't recommend watching the YouTube clip of it - it's very...silly. \\n\\n\r\nED was good too, though I believe this series will be remembered mostly for the OP. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was good, I didn't feel they lacked in that department, especially with the shooting, oh god that thing, highlight of the meme year, you'll see for yourself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is the high point of the series - outstanding man. One of the few characters we can relate to because of his actions, the ways he deals with a problem at hand. He's a believable hero, which is rare these days. A good job on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist was very underwhelming. Very little sense in what he does, no background to explain that sort of thinking. In fact, due to his hobbies (this is spoiler free after all) you would expect the absolute opposite. If this was meant as a shock effect on human nature, it was not done right. I hope you'll like him better than I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are generally well done and realistic enough to fit well with the story and support the main character. The support character of the antagonist however, is disappointing. I understand the need to give the antagonist some closure before and after certain events, but this felt forced and her reasoning is out of the water.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion : \\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I think this was one of the good animes of this season and I would recommend it to everyone as it was a good experience, hilarious at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "I think that this series has a pretty unique anime protagonist that we barely see nowadays. Often times it would be some teenage boy, but this series has our hero be an old man. Someone who is old old and not some young looking immortal being or some old man that is handsome, just an old man. Ichiro Inuyashiki to me is someone I kind of find refreshing since I keep getting the typical young hero or how old people are often the typical perverts or mentors or that side character.\r\nBut to make things better, he gets to be a awesome robot! And what hewants to do with his new state is really noble and heartwarming. I mean before all of that, he is pretty much a pushover who is weak and all. But when he became a robot, he instead wants to use his new powers to save others and it just makes my heart glow to see him being able to help someone after all the pain and sadness he gone through with his family and life. Its kind of nice to see a story of a man who just got powers and decides to use it to help everyone as his main goal. It just helps me see that despite becoming a robot, that side of him makes him really human.\\n\\n\r\nAnd heck, it was also interesting to see him getting used to learn more about his powers and how he can apply modern society and technology to let him help more people. Like the time where he learns to control his car and all. It's kind of like introducing your grandpa to anime as he tries to learn something about it and all. I personally find it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes I feel bad for him when he fails to save someone and even before that I felt bad for him. As mentioned before, his life was not that good. His family did not care for him and he was dying of cancer. I did feel something for this man and that made his victories more worthwhile. Every time he was on screen helping someone, I would cheer for the dude. I got excited when he fought against some kids who tried to kill some hobo, I would cheer on the dude when he learns about a new function on his body and so on.\\n\\n\r\nNow the down side of the series is the main antagonist, Hiro Shisigami. At first, he leads an interesting concept that killing people makes him more human and is a polar opposite for our hero. But that is contradicting the fact that he has two people he care about and all. I sometimes think that if he wanted to protect them, he should never have gone on a killing spree. Eventually his need to kill is just boring and repetitive since what else is there to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe worse part is that he gets the most screen time. It's often about him killing people and making us try to like him when he is really unlikable. I felt that he should of have little screen time and just have his moments be about how he slowly becomes more evil due to his desire to feel human instead of what we got. As a result, it ruins any more time to develop out protagonist that I grew to like. The only thing I like about this dude is how he would say \"bang\" to kill and how in the last few episodes he made the stakes higher which I wish it would just stay that way instead of forcing us to feel bad for him.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series could of been better if we focus and develop more on the main character than the antagonist. It has potential, but it did not work in the end. I guess manga artist are so used to giving focus to the typical handsome guys. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nAlso did not like how it ended as it would of worked for me if the protagonist was developed more like learning more about his powers, the flaws of good vs evil, and so on.",

            "content": "This series has 2 protagonists; it's essentially showing you how a good person vs an evil person would handle becoming a god and what happens when they figure out each others existence. The beginning episodes are meant to highlight their intents and their sense of purpose or malice. It's essentially a take on if god and the devil were both on earth and showing the chaos and miracles that ensue. The characters are written extremely well; you truly get a sense for their personality, morals etc. in the first two episodes. The art and sound are both top tier; but the art isn't on thelevel of lets say magus bride or houseki no kuni. The sound also has some instances where a simple musical piece would enhance it big time but it's not lacking; just not top end. \\n\\n\r\nI allways watch anime at \"moviesonline(.)fm\" that web update new anime of this autumn everyday. I can find all new anime i need at it. moviesonline.fm is the best for your choice to watch hot anime.",
