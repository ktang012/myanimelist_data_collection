            "content": "My Opinion:\r\nIn a world polluted with otaku-targeted shows, ACCA:13 feels like a breath of fresh air and stands out through its intriguing plot and character cast. \r\nFrom the beginning of this anime season I looked forward to watching ACCA:13, a show that conveys a delicate theme through an interesting, slow-burning plot accompanied by characters with intriguing personalities.\r\nThe animation worked in tandem with the sound department and offered an immersive experience in  which I could really enjoy the show to its fullest.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe kingdom of Dowa, which is subdivided into 13 autonomous states, has many agencies that are controlled by the giant organization known asACCA. \\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Jean Otus, the second-in-command of the ACCA inspection agency which is tasked with overseeing and monitoring the rest of the ACCA branch agencies. Jean often has business trips from the agency headquarters in the capital to the other 12 districts in order to review the situation and personnel there.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series begins, we are introduced to the protagonist who is tasked with auditing other ACCA agency branches and we witness his skills in uncovering even the smallest misdoings but we are also introduced to the \u201cmain\u201d plot, the coup d'etat. \\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes may be a tad bit boring because they focus on describing the world, introducing the characters and their relations but that is only to be expected of the first few episodes and in my opinion they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nACCA does not have a particular selling point and it can be easily overlooked by the casual viewer due to its passive nature but in truth, ACCA is quite engaging and thought provoking.\\n\r\nThe plot progresses at a slow and methodical pace, carefully and subtly revealing information that will later be necessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mainly focused on presenting the characteristics, people and atmosphere of the districts, most episodes are built around the protagonist taking a business trip to one of the districts where he will audit, make observations and meet people that will describe the district. \\n\r\nAt times, the show may feel episodic but the coup d'etat plot will bring all those pieces together in a way that progresses the plot in a firm yet delicate manner that feels fluid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately the majority of the large character cast lacks zest, most of them being \u201cdry\u201d and used for decor but there are some fairly original characters who definitely had intriguing features that aroused my interest.\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the characters do a great job, they work well together and give an immersive watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nJean Otus is the second-in-command of the ACCA inspection agency, a small branch that monitors the other branches. He is a compulsive smoker, always carrying around his trademark cigarette case, earning him the title of \"cigarette peddler\". He is also absent minded, often forgetting arranged plans or even his lighter despite his smoking habit.\\n\r\nThe first episode shows Jean on a regular weekday and we witness his skills in uncovering even the smallest misdoings, easily and cleverly exposing the corrupt worker.\\n\r\nJean maintains a dull uninterested demeanor, but has proven himself to be rather intelligent and sharp on more than one occasion.\\n\r\nHe is not an easy to read character, he is enigmatic. Jean doesn\u2019t offer his opinions but rather controls the flaw of the discussion, he doesn\u2019t make statements but rather observations, he is calm, honest and has a rational way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nNino is a close friend of Jean\u2019s, an old friend he can be comfortable around and talk about his problems and worries but as the story unfolds, we find out Nino is more than just a good friend. Certain episodes will reveal Nino\u2019s true role but in the end, Nino has always respected the friendship he shares with Jean.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other characters worth mentioning such as Lotta (stress reliever), Mauve and the prince but they are not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is consistently good with nice character design and background art. The color palette fits the tone of the show, giving an overall pleasant watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is great and the ending theme was good, the background music was very well suited for the show, offering an immersive experience. The voice actors perfectly interpreted the characters and perfectly blended with the chill tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI found ACCA:13 to be a highly entertaining show that kept me pressing the \u201cnext\u201dbutton. I liked the plot and I think the characters were very good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\r\nA surprisingly good show that I highly enjoyed. If you are looking for flashy fight scenes and hyped up moments, this is not the show you want, but in case you are lseeking a thought provoking show, I recommend giving ACCA:13 a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever feel like you just want to slouch on your couch and savor the taste of vintage fine wine? That's what the suave, stylistic ACCA feels like. It has a very sweet, but calming taste, it's never sharp, and is striking because of it. And on top of keeping such a presentation the show offers a perspective of many cultures and how they affect society. It's a road trip in aesthetic, but extremely political in essence. If raw exposition about political power moves and stances are not to you liking, then you won't like this show. To keep perspectives as they are, it is veryimpartial to all of them, and therefore very monotone. The most emotional engagement aside from a dry coup d'\u00c9tat intrigue plot, is the cute little sister with little screen time. And that's fine by me!  \\n\\n\\n\r\nACCA doesn't have an obvious selling point. It is what it says on the tin. Our protagonist goes to other districts to check up if they are doing everything within regulations. It's all about absorbing each district's unique flavor and atmosphere, how it has affected people's lifestyles and behaviours. How it softens them, how it hardens them with different resolves and different priorities.  \\n\r\nThe coup d'\u00c9tat plotline is merely used as an overarching subtext to have all these pieces come together into one who at the end. And it's all done through exposition dialogue that feels as natural as it can be. Everyone is an adult who is keenly aware of their situation, as much as the viewer at least, and slowly, people start revealing their hands and desires behind the masks of courtesy.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather dry unfortunately. They are professionals and each one of them has a specific role to play.  \\n\r\nOur protagonist, Jean embodies this as well. His seemingly apathetic attitude is to give a grounding for the viewer, so we can intimately share his perspective. He doesn't offer his opinions much, he asks for them instead. Just like the viewer, he's absorbing the culture he's visiting. He doesn't want to influence it in any way. He's given a few badass points for being damn good at his job and sharp on the clues that are given to us. We know how the state of things are as he does, along with the twists and turns.  \\n\r\nNino serves as a shadow of Jean, an old, reliable buddy he can always be comfortable with and share his worries and troubles without any reprehension. Nino also plays a big role in the story, but he's always a loyal friend to Jean first and foremost.  \\n\r\nLotte is the cute girl that fills any scene with happiness and fluffiness. She relieves whatever tension there is from the coup d'\u00c9tat plot and its developments.  \\n\r\nAll the other characters are very much background dressing, and they are so many. Showing the show's commitment to its own fiction, giving it a face, a grounding for us to see people as they are, not as just human resources on a paper.  \\n\r\nAt worst, Jean and a few other characters are impenetrable, meaning, they don't emote, they simply fulfil their roles with little qualms or reaction. Due to that monotony of exposition dumps with small emotional subtext, it gets frustrating that there's seemingly nothing happening to anyone, no one is troubled, no one seems overly concerned to build some kind of actual tension or a motive you can get behind. And all the revelations are reserved until the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation is what truly holds the show together. The chill atmosphere, the slender character designs animated in a softer fashion. The watercolor backgrounds giving a very surreal, yet enamouring aesthetic from the urban district to the desert district. Again, all to underline the show's confidence in its own setting and writing. The character animations give them quite a bit more life and personality than usual, everyone has a certain movement, a tell to who they are and what they represent, besides their looks, or their roles.  \\n\\n\r\nAudio directing is on point throughout the show. Music helps set the mood of each scene and district, while the sound effects still provide for an immersive setting. The voice acting is monotone on purpose, but for once it feels like actual adults just exchanging daily words, keeping things professional, if impartial. Oh and let's not forget the smokin' OP. The ED is a good relief for a chill show that just went by with no effort, yet all the cerebral engagement of how every piece fits in the jigsaw puzzle that is the coup.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, ACCA is a pure cerebral experience, held by its chill attitude and suave aesthetic. It doesn't offer much in terms of emotional engagement, but it's not a bad price to pay for a show that is mentally engaging, yet weirdly comfy. It's very easy to appreciate its commitment to world building and an intrigue narrative. And I loved every second of this experience.",

            "content": "ACCA was a nice change of pace from the usual. It was slow, but interesting. You can chill and watch, but if you chill too much, you might miss out on all the little details.\r\n7/10 story: \r\nStory isn't complex or anything, but it still keeps you guessing. You at times wonder where the story is going and who to trust and who not to trust. What is this guy planning? What about that guy? As a viewer, I felt like Tony Soprano at the end of The Sopranos. Paranoid as fuck and kept yelling at the screen,\"No, don't trust that guy!\" and then when itturns out my guess was wrong, I'd turn to the next character and be like,\"Oh, hell no! Definitely don't trust that guy!\" This anime felt like something that could of happened irl and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 art: \\n\r\nThe animation is pretty consistently well done. I like the character designs and etc. Nothing else to really say, but if you're not convinced, it's animated by Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 sound:\\n\r\nThere were quite a few good openings this season, but this one was just so damn catchy! The osts and everything. Even the ending song. Every sound this anime made got my ears attention. This anime had the best sound out of any anime I've heard this season. I put the volume way higher whenever I came back to this anime weekly. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 character:\\n\r\nThere's quite a few characters that were interesting. Like Jean, Niino.. Actually, there's quite a lot of characters that had interesting traits. Jean's not give a fuck attitude, Niino had the is he best friend or just a job thing going on, a lot of people were schemers, and a lot of people liked bread lol. But with such a huge cast of characters and the focus always shifting to Jean, I tend to forget some characters. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 enjoyment: \\n\r\nIt was slow, but the sound, guesses on what's what, relaxing type anime really made me enjoy this anime for what it was. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 overall:\\n\r\nThis is the type of anime where I probably wouldn't watch again because guessing what would happen is a huge chunk of the fun, but for a first watch it was pretty damn fun.",

            "content": "The concept of a coup de\u2019tat, in which a plot is developed to overthrow a populace\u2019s own government, has been around for centuries. In fact, the history goes back as far as 870 B.C. in which an Israeli commander Zimri killed his own king to commandeer the throne for himself (he later committed suicide due to talks of being overthrown by his own subordinate- karma\u2019s a bitch, eh?). Most recently, our Lord and Savior, Studio Madhouse adapted a little known manga, ACCA, which primarily centers itself around this historical theme. With rather mixed impressions, ACCA attempts to overthrow anime stereotypes with its atypical approach whilealso looking to become a future cult classic.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Jean Otus, an inspector for ACCA, an organization created after an ugly coup de\u2019tat dismantled the previous country Dowa\u2019s authority. He's tasked with performing a short-cycled audit of each of the countries 13 regions, recognized for his supreme skill to uncover even the faintest trace of malpractice. Jean has to deal with the stress of auditing in addition to lofty rumors that he may be involved with some deep rooted plotting of his own. What follows is a slow burning story of politics, royalty, deception and secrecy. ACCA is most certainly an anime to be overlooked by the casual viewer, due to its passive nature. But underneath the political rhetoric and lack of action is a gripping plot to note. It has a marked plot twist, which caught me completely off guard without being unfounded. The characters have deeper agendas not worn on their sleeves, and nobody is who they appear to be. I thoroughly enjoyed dissecting the intricate details of each scene looking for clues to the next story turn.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I personally enjoyed the approach, many will be quick to disregard the series based on its slow, methodical episodes. Not a lot seems to be purposeful on the first pass through, but the copious amounts of foreshadowing and allusion to other events make it worthwhile in the end. It's an anime best watched in one big chunk like an extended film rather than week to week, one of its greatest downfalls. In addition to the pacing, if you're looking for action for this Winter season past a stern one way conversation\u2026 I'd advise you look to Youjo Senki or Kobayashi Dragon Maid to get your fix. ACCA, as previously mentioned, is a slow burning anime putting the cerebral first, while flashy, fast-paced scenes take a firm backseat.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels to modern day government and royalty can be easily made, however the setting for ACCA appears to be entirely unique to our world. Some normal commodities in our countries (cigarettes, sweets) are quite rare in Jean\u2019s world, and being deemed as \u201cthe cigarette pedeller\u201d, he finds himself the topic of much scrutiny wherever he travels. Having previously served in the military myself, I could sympathize with a lot of the procedural and inspection-based lingo present within the more militant scenes. The writers also did a rather accurate job of emulating the true feel of exhaustion emoted by Jean as he traveled through the many regions to perform his duties. Often turning to drink despite his inability to hold his liquor, Jean\u2019s languid nature is catalyzed when alcohol is involved. His best friend Niino, whose association is a mystery, often keeps Jean company amidst his various endeavors. \\n\\n\r\nJean Otus as a main protagonist is rather uninteresting. He doesn't get excited about much, his appearance is rather plain and he doesn't have many friends. He's your typical introvert, who would rather spend a weekend at home in tranquility than trek around bars with his coworkers (I can totally relate to this). His parents died in a tragic train accident several years ago, and was obligated to be the primary caretaker for his younger sister Lotto, due mostly to her much younger age and maturity level. Much like you would expect from a hermit like Jean, his feelings are shown rather than told to the viewers, resulting in a higher difficulty to relate on an emotional level to him throughout the anime. Although I won't give too much away, there may be a deeper reason the writers chose  Lotto is flighty and carefree, often subdued by the appearance of a doughy pastry or cake, but she stands by Jean\u2019s side despite their stark differences.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters, though not fully explored due to a lack of air time, have their fair share of mysteries as well. Whether it's the secret meetings Jean undergoes with the Director-General or the convenient \u201cbusiness trips\u201d Niino travels to, each episode unveils another small piece of the pie. I do wish some more time would've been spent on the side characters in order to fully understand the story, but I'm often overexpectant in 12 episode anime. Nothing new here.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that I like the art style Madhouse had the freedom to use in ACCA. Though not \u201cgreat\u201d by modern anime standards, the animation is consistent, which is more than I can say for some other action oriented shows out there. And even though I normally despise this comment, \u201cit stayed true to the manga\u201d. The character designs, including the incorporation of the military uniforms were reminiscent of my younger years. Unique, but familiar enough to invoke some slight nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP might be my favorite of the season. It incorporates a jazzy beat with a powerful and catchy chorus. The added collage of vivid images almost tells us a story of how the anime unfolds. I would imagine that Mother\u2019s Basement guy from YouTube would get his jollies from interpreting this opening. The ED is pretty standard and delicate, and I often found found myself skipping it altogether. The background music had some serious Speed Grapher/Bebop vibes, and were certainly better placed than the first of those anime. Seiyus did a decent job providing some convincing in their portrayals, but really no breakout performances here.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I'm in the minority when it comes to my enjoyment of ACCA. Modern anime is laden with goofy, bombastic characters, glitzy action and panty shots galore. The best part? ACCA has none of these. So, if you're looking for a show that breaks the mold in almost every possible way, or are growing tired of the gimmicky cash grabs pilfered at anime fans, I'd recommend checking it out. It is a great candidate for a \u201chidden gem\u201d if given the proper care while watching it, and a series I'm glad I picked up this season. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter \u201817 reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall-7.2",

            "content": "From the start of the season this was the thing I was the most excited about. While it did have its good points, it ultimately became the thing that most disappointed me of the Winter 2017 season. I will now proceed to tell you why in EXCRUCIATING detail. \r\nOur setting is the Kingdom of Dowa: a continent/kingdom made up of many districts, shaped like a bird, and populated by gangly noodle-people. Our hero is Jean Otus, a blond guy who smokes cigarettes, wears jackets, and works in the titular governmental organization ACCA as some sort of district inspector. This is about all we know abouthim. Also he has a sister and a friend with blue hair.\\n\\n\r\nJean is tasked with visiting the various districts of Dowa and \"auditing\" them, which consists of 50% looking through file cabinets at papers in a very boring way and 50% coincidentally stumbling into dramatic events that all seem to center around Jean while somehow also not involving him at all. Superficially tense political games and a lot of talking ensue.\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\nA.) It looks awesome. ACCA has a very distinct visual style, managing to be both vibrant and relaxed. It has the feel of a watercolor painting: colorful but also a bit ethereal. \\n\r\nB.) Both the OP and ED are great, the first being a fun cool colorful romp and the second a stunningly animated tranquil dance scene. \\n\r\nC.) I mostly really like the characters, with Jean himself being the notable and unfortunate exception. He is either very subtle or very boring, and unfortunately we find out by the end that he is very much the latter. I ended up having to look up his name to write this review, because I couldn't remember if it was \"Jean\" or \"Jin.\" All the side characters are fun and interesting, so that\u2019s something.  \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nA.) As mentioned before, Jean himself. Everybody in the show itself seem to think he is the greatest most interesting shit in the world. Either he is a secret genius who is playing his cards SUPER close to the vest and not showing us any of it, or he isn't and is actually the most boring man in the world whose only personality trait seems to be that he is a smoker.\\n\r\nB.) The pacing is garbage. It is SLOW and feels SLOOWER. \\n\r\nC.) Like Mushishi it is not in a rush to get anywhere, but unlike Mushishi it ultimately never does. The story immediately lags and it gets boring quickly.\\n\r\nD.) It is not in the least bit exciting. There have been moments of charm that have made me want to get more, but they are not frequent enough to make me instantly want to watch another episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show by the end was that nobody changed or developed in the slightest. They are all exactly the same at the end of the show as they were at the start. The sad truth is that the character that underwent the most development was the coddled prince\u2019s servant Magie, whose development consists of him learning that he likes bread.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime get criticized for being nothing but talking, but beside eating bread and smoking cigarettes more or less nothing else occurred in 12 episodes. It was constant exposition that ended up settling up nothing. It is a crying shame because the characters look great and the world is super cool, but the show reminded me of a Kardashian in that it looks pretty and very effortfully crafted but is ultimately unengaging because it is devoid of any depth or interest. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT AHEAD\\n\\n\r\n\tIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway because you shouldn\u2019t watch the show, and it won\u2019t ruin anything because there is nothing to ruin, but I though I\u2019d warn you. It seems only polite. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the previous complaints I have about this show disappointed me, but this one pissed me the f off. The only \u201cbad\u201d people in this show are brown, and the only brown people in this show are \u201cbad.\u201d The show also does a great job of very pointedly not calling them \u201cArabs,\u201d which just serves to call attention to the brown skinned, oil wealthy, immoral, racist elephant in the room. Literally the only people of color of any significance in this entire postulated world are portrayed as greedy manipulative villains. In the end they choose to just go away and sit in the corner so all the white people can resume their blissful perfect lives. I will also add that I, myself, am white as the driven snow. I am not saying this out of any feelings that the show has attacked me personally. It was so blatant that it made me, not a target of the seemingly intentional demonization of a group of people, feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Do better guys. We are better than this. \\n\\n\r\nSo Jean is, in fact, playing a long game, but unfortunately that long game turns out to be Monopoly: the most tedious, dialogue heavy, longest game of all. His master plan is literally designed to ensure that nothing will change, and that the huge amount of narrative debt that the show has built up after 12 episodes of stoic talky political drama is entirely unpaid. Every single problem presented throughout the run of the show is wrapped up in a neat little bow with no bloodshed or ill will. Except, of course, on the part of the brown people, but as we have previously established they do not matter due to the fact that they are brown because they are evil and evil because they are brown. It is so painfully contrived and saccharine that it made me a little embarrassed to watch on behalf of the writer. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to drive my point home, the last line of dialogue in the show is \u201cWe really haven\u2019t changed, have we?,\u201d with the feeling that it is being delivered directly to camera with a cheeky wink. No, ACCA, you have not. But I have. At the beginning I kind of liked you. Here at the end I have nothing but disappointment and pity left for what you could\u2019ve been.",

We are 4 episodes into it and the setup seems great. Also the setting was fairly unique(Not high school or Video game) \\n\r\nAt this point anything could happen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where the show really got me. Seeing the same shit again and again had become boring. At first it doesn't seem that the characters are all that special(But their personality traits are reviled one by one subtly) and  their variety was pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not bad but nothing of incredible consequence\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation style is unique. Personally I like the animation style. I'd say animation quality is constant unlike shows like Haikyuu!! or Yuri on Ice where it peaks and then drops. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI understand why some people might not like this show. Since it starts of slow, flashy stuff doesn't happen frequently and the mood is fairly calm.\\n\r\nBut why does a show have to do flash stuff or bring eccentric or absolutely stupid characters. \\n\\n\r\nI think as the show goes on people will start to appreciate the show because of how well the story will develop. I hope that the industries will produce more of such audio visual content in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Ah ACCA, a title that took me by surprise as we witness this anime adaptation by Natsume Ono. I have to admit, the show is hard to accept at first. The premise sounds like something from 1984 and mixes in police drama with political affairs. First impressions of the show can really be a make or break for viewers to continue watching. As such, I suggest watching ACCA with an open mind because by doing that, you can enjoy the storytelling much easier.\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, the storytelling moves at a pretty slow pace. It takes patience to accept the story because the first few episodesdecides to focus a lot more on building the world setting. In the Kingdom of Doma, there are 13 districts. ACCA is an organization that provides services to each of these distinct services. The show focuses on a man named Jean Otus, the second command of ACCA as he gets himself involved in a complex affair of events that may even include a coup d'\u00e9tat. As you can imagine, this builds up the story as each episode bring in together pieces and pieces like a puzzle. In the meantime, we can get to see the inner workings and affairs going on in Doma. To say the least, the world building of this show has a lot of interesting qualities. Each district has their own unique society that differs from each other. While the show doesn\u2019t fully explore every district, it gets its point across that there are conflicting struggle between some sides. \\n\\n\r\nFor most parts, the characters in the show are fleshed out by their positions (often ranks) and their personality. Jean is the main guy we\u2019ll get familiar with the most. He is enigmatic and difficult to read on the surface. He also loves to smoke and is often seen with a cigarette in his mouth. With such a mysterious character, you\u2019ll definitely find him difficult to understand although his approach at dealing with certain situations is insightful. His sister, Lotta is just the opposite as she is often cheerful and has a big appetite for sweets. At times, it will feel like they are living in different worlds apart. As the show progresses, we also learn more about the other ACCA members. Characters such as Grossular will be a challenge for Jean to overcome as he suspects the latter of being involved in a coup to overthrow the king. Some of his character also suggests Grossular may be the one involved in the coup himself. Either way, the show does a decent job at making the audience anticipate what will happen next with these characters. On the opposite spectrum, there are guys like Lilium who dismisses Jean as being possibly involved in the coup. At the center of it, we also meet Mauve, the director general of ACCA. She is the one that actually believes a coup may end up happening and gets Jean involved in the investigation. A mysterious character like herself is quite admiring as she demonstrates leadership characteristics. Her role in the show can be determined easily although the audience will have to judge on whether her approach to certain situations as right or wrong. Finally, I have to admit that the Prince of Doma Kingdom is really hard for me to accept. We even learn a bit of background story about certain royalty and as interesting as it seems, it isn\u2019t what I find too accepting. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, ACCA\u2019s storytelling is rather predictable. Certain revelations can be easily drawn from hints and speculations, some that can be easily recognized. While that\u2019s not really impressive to go by, it does like to also take risks to flesh out certain characters\u2019 motives. One of the more dynamic character relationships is between Jean and Nino. Now, Nino is a close friend of Jean\u2019s and throughout the show, we find out that he appears to be a lot more than just being his friend. Certain episodes will reveal his true role as we see how his relationship with Jean develop from certain revelations. The key success though is the background story. Even as predictable as the show can be at times, we learn why characters\u2019 roles are played out like the way they do. ACCA succeeds at pulling the trigger to executing characters\u2019 roles while all the time getting viewers invested about their motivations. Whether you\u2019ll enjoy this show with that aspect though is up to you.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Madhouse studio, the show has a very distinctive feel at adapting the art style. The unique approach that director Seiko Yoshioka really is dynamic when you look at it carefully. Every district has their own style while the royal palace stands as the most noticeable structure. The character designs have a good degree of freedom. Characters such as Jean are given simple appearances to make them not stand out while others such as characters from royalty are given more flameboyant-like appearances. The designs aren\u2019t entirely faithful to the manga though as it does look different. Also, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed the momentum of the artwork. While character expressions are well delivered, the show feels very static at times that almost feels like a picture drama. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to music, ACCA excels at this field thanks to Ryo Takahashi\u2019s talent. The directing of the soundtrack and music really brings this show to life. The piano-like rhythms and melody of each episode is dynamic while the theme songs are choreographed with a unique approach. Character voice mannerism isn\u2019t to be underestimated either especially for characters like Mauve, Nino, and even Jean himself. \\n\\n\r\nACCA 13-ku Kansatsu-ka (ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.) is a difficult show to recommend to anyone. Any fan of police drama who is interested in world building may get a better experience than others. If you\u2019re looking for action, then this is definitely the wrong show to invest time in. ACCA is much more about what is on the surface but rather the internal affairs that goes on behind the scenes. The complex characters offers a mature approach style of storytelling without going overboard. In the meantime, ACCA\u2019s pacing will hinder some viewers into spending more time to watch the show. However, I would definitely put time into this series as it offers so much more than what it just looks like.\\n",

            "content": "You never heard of a dark horse? The term comes from the dark horses in horse racing. They aren't the popular ones that most people will bet on, but they automatically catch at least a few eyes willing to give them a chance, and low and behold, they do surprisingly well in the race, sometimes even winning. Given how bleak this season has been for most people, this seemed like one of those surprising shows that could've been one of the best of the season, but, as the saying goes, \"close but no cigar\". Fitting, really.\r\n*Paragraph 4 contains mild spoilers for ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka. Proceedwith caution*\\n\\n\r\nACCA is an interesting show. Produced by Studio Madhouse, this is an adaptation from a manga. Ultimately, this show intrigued a lot of people, myself included. Some people will definitely see his as the dark horse of the season, but I don't entirely agree. There are strong cases to be made why this show was interesting and why it was boring, but we'll get to that. But why the polarization? Isn't this series slick as hell? Well...\\n\\n\r\nTo a decent extent, the story is meticulously written in terms of creating a mystery full of twists and turns. It all surrounds Jean Otus, a man working for ACCA that is currently doing audits while the prince of the nation is not only coming of age but is ready to succeed the throne. Problem number 1 is that the story really dead its feet with nothing to truly hook us for more aside from hoping that it will all explode into a chaotic and flavorful conclusion towards the final act; it doesn't. It's understandable why this turns people off, as the show feels uneventful. Two, some of these twists were both obvious and poor. The final antagonist was one of the royals whom we had never even heard of until 2/3 into the series, with two of the ACCA 5 Chief Officers being antagonists with their own separate plot. If you're anything like me, you suspected the two that turned out to be antagonists, and there was only 1 other person to remotely suspect, who isn't involved, but there could've been more flavor to the mystery by giving reason to suspect more people. \\n\\n\r\nSo, because Jean was suspected of being involved in an upcoming coup, his friend, Nino, is sent to spy on him, but then it's revealed that he is next in like to be king, which is why the rumor was created, in order to get the 13 districts on his side during his audits. Sounds fine and dandy, and for most part, it is, including the somewhat rushed backstory of Nino, Jean, and his sister, Lotta. It's thanks to that that the aunt of the family wants them dead, as well as the dickheaded prince himself. As for the finale, it was ok. It was interesting to see the whole coup resolve peacefully but with more twists, but there was no reason for the aunt to suddenly abandon her plan.\\n\\n\r\nTell me, who do you remember besides Jean and Nino? Probably nobody because these characters are mostly dull and one-note. Jean is pretty listless, by it is nice seeing him get flustered over his crush/superior Mauve, though that fades quickly. He also smokes...a lot. Just like on older times, in this anime, smoking is a sign of wealth and he gets misconstrued because of it, particularly when confronted by Rail, who acts like an ass around him and likes his sister. Nino is a slick guy, even in spy mode, but he's merely ok. Mauve, Lotta, and Gossular are merely ok, and most of the characters are boring, like prince Schwan, the aunt, the spoiler manipulator in the 5 Chief Officers, and each of Jean's subordinates and audit companions. We could've easily spent a bit more time about the characters but instead, we chose to do more audits and see the main 3 eat apple pie and drink alcohol. Like the plot, the interesting potential really fizzes out, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nTo this day, I'm not sure how to feel about the art-style. However, what is something I'm sure of is that the series is clearly not in 24FPS. The animation is rather choppy, making it feel like the series runs at only 16 frames per second instead of the minimum required 24 for everything to feel like they're in constant motion. I'm not sure if this is an artistic choice, but I don't think it works. I at least like the hair and food detail, as well as the detail in the casino lights in episode 8. The OP has amazing artistic flair to the way it looks, and the ED has another type of interesting art that is actually more fluid than the entirety of the actual series, which is kinda sad the more you think about it. After all, you'd probably expect better from Studio Madhouse since Studio DEEN did more fluid and striking animation with their also more methodical and realistic series, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. Thankfully the mediocre CGI is insanely minimal to the point where most people would find it nonexistent, even if some of the character faces are actually incomplete in the final episodes and the background characters often fit move in scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is pretty nice and fitting, especially the jingle at the beginning and middle of episode 1. It fits the calmer, more lax and methodical nature of the series perfectly, preventing me from really getting bored, but that didn't stop some people from boredom. The OP, \"Shadow and Truth\" by ONE III NOTES is pretty cool, with surprisingly good J-rap and a great female singer (even during autotune sections). There's a reason people say this is one of the best OPs of the season, it's pretty freakin' slick. As for the ED, \"Pale Moon ga Yureteru (\u30da\u30fc\u30eb\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u3086\u308c\u3066\u308b)\" by Aira Yuuki, is a pretty alright theme meant for some bit of emotion after each episode. Not great but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, it's rather good. J Michael Tatum was in charge of ADR direction and we get some rather fitting boxes for many of the characters, especially Jean and Nino. It's weird to hear someone sound like Steve Blum without being Steve Blum, but that's been an issue in the dubbing industry for a good year now (where new actors sound like old ones, and this was exposed to be a major problem in the acting industry in Japan). It feels like the character art-style lends itself to both the dub and the sub rather well, and the dub worked just as well as the sub, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I was pretty intrigued by the narrative, even if it did get a bit dull towards the end. The atmosphere was pretty enjoyable, and the OP was so damn good that I just wanna bob my head and snap to the beat every time. It was surprisingly enjoyable if a bit lacking in the satisfaction department. T'was a nice enough time, but there wasn't enough pizzazz to give real flavor to the experience, making it somewhat underwhelming. It's by no means a bad show, but there's no way in hell this'll be smoking the competition for any \"best of winter 2017\" lists, I'm sure. It didn't rise up high, but it was decent and slick while it lasted, so that's alright, I guess. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "ACCA is a story that says to hell with expectations and preconceived notions on what makes anime good, throwing the staples of anime tradition to the wayside in favor of a more subtle, nuanced approach to storytelling.\r\nAs such, It should come to no surprise to know that this winter season\u2019s ACCA has dissenting opinions among the anime community. Some people have cited it as \u2018People talking, the anime.\u2019\r\nAfter all, the show doesn\u2019t aim to dazzle us in the way we\u2019ve come to expect from traditional series\u2014 there are no explosive visuals, no internal monologue, no signature moves or battles, nor is there any trademark fanserviceto feast on\u2014 there\u2019s just our protagonist Jean Otus and his day-to-day dialogues with people as he does his job. The show\u2019s lowkey vibes will fool the more passive viewers \u2013 the ones used to anime that panders to their senses \u2013 into believing there\u2019s nothing there. Much of the action and excitement of ACCA comes from deciphering the dialogue to find the hidden meanings behind character\u2019s intents.\\n\\n\r\nACCA asks us to work for it \u2014 to think about what lies beneath the exterior \u2014 informing us that we need to tread carefully, lest we become victims to false expectations. This should be alarming to the army of anime viewers that have been spoiled with the rush of instant gratification and exposition. To fully enjoy ACCA, we need to drop all assertions of the medium and have patience. In a series subtlety unveiling key plot points through character interactions and nuance of expressions, the responsibility lies with us, the viewer, to avoid being entangled in the web of deceit woven by dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Jean Otus, shows a carefulness about himself and how he approaches the world. He exudes a calm and collected demeanor that permeates the atmosphere of the narrative at surface level. Armed with astute observations and skepticism, he is aware that everyone is attempting to appeal to his simple pleasures. He plays characters attempts at manipulation with a cool, enigmatic indifference.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, we can\u2019t really tell what anyone is thinking in the series \u2014 there\u2019s no way to know because we can\u2019t see into the character\u2019s thoughts -- and that's where the appeal is. ACCA gradually and intricately weaves a plot entangled in mystery. We\u2019re forced to follow the breadcrumbs given to us through exploring what is said and seen. ACCA\u2019s allure thus, lies in its ability to engage the audience, telling you that truth is somewhere just beyond the lies. The series calls upon us to be active participants of the medium to get more out of it.\\n\\n\r\nACCA tells us that the very notion of expectations is the enemy. The scenes with food aren\u2019t there as simple filler, as one may think, but rather to showcase the contradictory nature of people and the allure of simple delights.\\n\\n\r\nWhich comes back to why ACCA isn\u2019t as popular as some of the other series of the winter. Those idly sitting by, waiting for their usual visual feasts simply won\u2019t get it. They\u2019re not accustomed to being active participants \u2014 to the intricacies and delights of subtle narration ACCA thrives under. The series is deceptively lowkey, and many have fallen prey to its subtleties. But if you take a closer look, approaching with an open mind, a rich and flavorful world is out there, ripe and ready, waiting to be sampled. \\n\\n\r\n-- Palpable \u10e6\u309d\u25e1\u2579)\u30ce\u2661\\n\\n\r\nFor the full review, visit my website at https://palpableemotion.com\\n\\n",

            "content": "ACCA is a slow burning political drama centered around a rumored coup d'\u00e9tat and set in the fantastical yet embedded in reality DOWA kingdom. It has a very rich style, a laid back intrigue and a cast of cool characters - that come more into the light as the plot develops in the second half. Through the world building, it made me care about what was happening to DOWA and the possibilities of where it was heading. \r\nThe land is segregated into thirteen unique and natural states based upon the history, government infrastructure and resources. The protagonist,  Jean, has a job to audit eachof these states, to check up on how things are going in this time of assumed peace. The world building is split into roughly one state per episode but there is a multi-layered world building approach; while you only really explore one state at a time, you can see how the characters compare the similarities and differences to each of the other states, which makes the world feel alive and interconnected. \\n\\n\r\nLike with the world, the characters also have a feeling of where you are only seeing the tip of the ice berg, and by piecing new information together, you eventually get a solid understanding of each of the characters. At first Jean appeared as being solely aloof and studious yet as you see how he handles situations and the thought processes he uses to deduct his response, it makes him become warmer and personable. As with his relationship with Crow and his sister, which is quiet fun in a subdued way. Most of the characters feel like they play an important part of DOWA and the side characters have there motivations revealed, although besides from hints they don't all become clear until the final few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show steeped in politics, there is plenty of crushes that inhabit a number of characters, and while it never bore any fruit, it was nice to highlight aspects of there personality of what they are attracted too as well with how they deal with that feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style looks mature but with a quirky edge like the abundance of mustaches, hair styles, fashion and fantastical looking food. I'm not sure if it was just a ploy to show a hereditary link between a few of the characters, but there is definitely a bread cult going on. There is a jazzy beat throughout which works well with the other worldly elements, quirky design choices and the cool headed characters. The framing of the landscape in relation to the characters was solid, there were occasionally goofy faceless moments but a lot of the time there was both a detailed background and characters kept on model. Apparently fingers are difficult to animate, so kudos to that.    \\n\\n\r\nACCA relishes in its style and develops its world and characters in a slow but constant pace. While not being particularly exciting to watch, I was always interested in to see what would happen next, what new piece of information would be revealed and what delicious looking food would appear. Like with the bread in the show, their lies a warm, well woven, bite sized meal that satiates in a simple and effective way. \\n\\n\r\n*passes jean a cigarette* /10",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nSend feedback if you have any\r\nACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. What an incredible piece of art. What seems like a simple story, a kingdom separated into 13 districts looked after by the organisation known as ACCA, manages to keep you guessing on how exactly everything is going to turn out. We follow Jean Otus, second-in-command of ACCA's inspection department, who travels to each and every district to make sure that any signs of corruption is discovered and prevented quickly. Starting off slow to introduce characters and some world building, the story steadily opens up to what can only be described, in the most non-spoilerway possible, as a quiet but planned out struggle for peace threatened by a higher power.\\n\\n\r\nWhat seems predictable at first, (oh a plot twist happens, I can see where this is going) continues to surprise you as you can never guess what is actually happening until the very end. The calm and cool atmosphere that surrounds most of the series lulls you into a sense of knowing more than you actually do, allowing it's unpredictable nature to continuously keep the show interesting. Secrets are revealed, plans are put into motion, multiple opposing views wait their turn to make sure that events are headed towards their favour. It's a perfect example of the phrase \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\\n\\n\r\nJean Otus is a simple but slightly mysterious man. Known by others as the \"Cigarette Peddler\", he's often seen with a lighter in his hand a smoke in his mouth. Not much is really known about Jean at the start. His only real goal that is revealed to us is that he wants to get a transfer to a different department. What could be seen as a dull and boring personality, this character manages to give off a feeling that he's much more intelligent than he seems. We see glimpses of his unique mind at work as he deals with some problems he faces in a few districts, showing off that he's actually more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nNino is also pretty mysterious. Reporter by day, he often joins Jean for a drink and a talk about their hard days at work. He could be seen as quite charismatic and a smooth talker, always hanging around our main and his sister Lotta. Not much is known about him at first, but slowly his secrets are also revealed to showcase a truly interesting character with a simple motive. Look out for the Otus family.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to talk about every character due to the large amount we are introduced to every episode, as Jean travels from district to district, and the fact that many of the main cast's characteristics may lead to accidental spoilers. While character development is usually focused on only a select few of frequently reoccurring faces, every person we meet along the journey is able to feel interesting. Although most fall into the background, each character has their own personality and goals for their own district and for ACCA as a whole. There enough development left over that is scattered to various members of the supporting cast that it feels like everyone Jean meets has a sense of realism that is hard to achieve in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is oddly unique yet similar to other shows at the same time. With a slight sketchbook like appearance, the art style really matches its relaxing atmosphere. It's not anything eye-popping, but it really adds to the show's mood of peacefulness. Even the hairdo of each character is special, as most districts have their own distinct hair colour. It's a subtle clue as to some important parts of the story, hidden incredibly well so only people that already know how the story progressions will be able to spot it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not often you find a show that has such an amazing story, drawing you in with each episode that passes. This show does take a bit of patience as it doesn't dive into the actual plot right away, but if you don't mind a slow but interesting series, then I highly recommend this.",

            "content": "ACCA was an anime released last year, Winter season. When I first read the plot of the story, I was kinda hesitant. I find it quite boring and too \u2018serious\u2019 for my liking (at that time). I thought to myself that this anime would be better if I binge-watch it when I\u2019m in a mood for a \u2018relaxing\u2019 and \u2018lazy\u2019 animes. Infairness, I was right.\r\nThis anime was indeed a surprise. I didn\u2019t expect I would like this show. I enjoyed watching this anime without worries. Just sitting back, relaxing on my chair and eating snacks. It was that laid-back. The last time I watched ananime that gave me this kind of feels was flying witch anime. It\u2019s been awhile.  Everything about this anime was done right. From the story to the music, I have no complaints, only compliments. But I still try to find some faults, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was solid from start to finish. Excellent writing. It felt like each conversation was really important, I can\u2019t skip even one. At the same time, I\u2019m not stressed thinking about the story. It was paced well, watching the series made me feel like I was watching a really really good old classic western movie. The ending satisfied my soul, it was executed really well. The world building of the story was also laid out in a way that its not drowning the viewers with too much information. I think one of the flaws of the story would be the slow and tone-down pacing in the first few episodes. It wasn\u2019t for everyone, that\u2019s why there were some people who dropped this series right off the bat. But still, the story and how it was build-up were definitely one of the strong factors of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect this series would have quite a lot of characters. Cuz they were too many of them, I couldn\u2019t memorise all their names. I only recognise each of them by their distinct look. The character designer did really well in making sure each one of them are unique from each other. But even with this unique qualities, most of the characters suffered a lot in the character development area. I think only the \u2018important\u2019 characters got the right amount of character development, but the others\u2026..nah. It was either not worthy of sharing or not relevant in the story. Still, each one of them were likeable at to some extent. And oh, Lotta is best little sister. I want a sister like her.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned above about how well-drawn each character of the anime. Even though most of them looks like each other, they were still unique. The art style was really unique. It felt like I had seen them before but I can\u2019t pinpoint what or when. The art definitely contribute in giving off the vibe of a western classic movie. Let us not forget the animation. It was really good. Like the art, the animation was done well. As expected from Madhouse studio. Even though they had been on decline lately, they still continue to blow my mind with a really really good release. The animation was like no other. It fitted well with the atmosphere and tone of the series. I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound were absolutely fantastic. I had heard quite a lot of praises with the OP song, after hearing it myself, Dang, it was good. It was so good, I even have the song right now on repeat on my phone. It was so catchy yet laidback. Very groovy but also smooth in the ears. I had eargasms every time I start a new episode. The ED was really good too, but it didn\u2019t liven up to the standards of the OP. I wasn\u2019t able to listen well to the sound in the background. I was too relax and focus on the story, I forgot to notice the music in the background. Dunno if what i did was a bad thing or a good thing. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was solid as rock. It was a really amazing experience, watching this series. Definitely a must binge-watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "ACCA definitely feels like an unusual show in our current anime climate, with its leisurely pace and art style. It's populated by gaunt, bishounen-style male characters of the kind you thought went out of fashion in the early 2000s, which is refreshing to see. But the best thing about ACCA is how a deeply comfortable and alluring show manages to blindside you with an exciting story.\r\nThe first half of ACCA plays out like a combination of food porn and travelogue, as protagonist Jean travels to his country's various picturesque regions, meeting people and devouring sweet bread. Tidbits of plot are revealed, but everything bubbles inthe background and the viewer is lead to believe that this will be a slice-of-life show, maybe with some shounen-ai queer-baiting. ACCA's episodic nature, beautiful art direction, and dreamy jazz soundtrack all contribute to crafting a show that's just nice to spend time with.\\n\\n\r\nBut surprisingly enough, the story takes form very quickly in the latter half of the show, without sacrificing its sense of pace or meandering nature. It's not a highly complicated story, but it heightens the viewer's awareness of what's going on in the background, and pieces fall into place at just the right time to have an impact. The final wallop of revelations at the very end only makes it feel more satisfying. Again, it's nothing mind-blowing, it's just told in a way that feels like it matters. I feel like it's mostly because ACCA is very character-centric, and the way in which characters react to events feels organic, but also reveals new depths to them.\\n\\n\r\nIn that sense, my major complaint with ACCA is that some supporting characters simply don't get enough screen time for us to get even mildly acquainted with them, when you can clearly tell that they are supposed to have some kind of background to them. I hate it when shows dangle characters in my face but then do absolutely nothing with them (see Durarara!!) because they ran out of time. It's just a \"read the manga\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I greatly enjoyed my time with ACCA and I'm pretty confident I'll be watching it again soon, because it's the kind of show that gets better with multiple viewings. It's probably not for everyone--aesthetically it's very out-of-pace with current anime trends--but it's just the kind of thing I love.",

            "content": "Some shows bore me to tears and feel like a chore to get through. ACCA however has the privilege of being a show that bored me into a strange cozy state of submission. It is a slice-of-life political thriller like no other.\r\nIt starts off with the art and music, which immerses you into the world with a colorful yet not overdone palette, accompanied by lounge-like piano music that doesn't dare to raise your heartbeat by even a smidgeon. This choice of tone manages to make the events on screen feel more grounded, but add to this some cinematography that's just kinda passable, and you alsohave a show that suffers from being very mundane in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are in a similar situation. Despite having varied designs and backstories, somehow they all seem to blur together into the same intelligent, mysterious, and polite personality; exceptions being few and far between. Most striking of all is our protagonist Jean, whose ability to show emotions range from mildly amused, to mildly not-so-amused. In a story centered on political intrigue, one would hope for at least one transparent character for the audience to latch onto, but instead we're left with few clues as to what anyone is truly thinking. To be fair, sometimes this minimalist approach to character interactions does work. The subtle nods between Jean and his best friend Nino are examples of how you can create a real connection with this kinda script. Personally I just wish there had been more of that.\\n\\n\r\nWhat elevates ACCA is its intrigue-driven plot and the world-building. As if watching old classic Soviet cinema, you get a sense that the true main character of the show is the country itself, rather than any single character. Many locations are explored, offering different political views and approaches to life, adding a multifaceted culture to it all. From that perspective, one could argue that the show did a gallant job in characterizing its setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ACCA comes recommended to those who are looking for a more light-hearted experience, one where they can dissect a fictional universe at their own pace.",

            "content": "Decently build Fantasy world with political powerplay for the throne.\r\nStory (8)\r\nWhile the story moves very slowly, with slightly too much slice of live in the first third of the show, but still engaging. There isn't much action; if you are looking for gunfights, chase scenes or even stealthy action, this will dissapoint. It' dialolge driven. The- to me- best parts are the presentations of the different states, they not only help to expand the world and scale of the story, but also further and intensify the plot. The Royal Backstory we get was also quite enjoyable, interesting mostly due to the perspective it was toldfrom, but a bit predictable. that sadly goes for the rest of the show too. Interesting, but kind of predictable. If you're familiar with the genre, non of it is really surprising. Still well executed tho. \\n\\n\r\nNow, one big concern i still have, is weather this anime will go full facist or not. There have been very few indicators until now, exept for-you know- the ACTUAL SS UNIFORMS and the blond blue-eyed protagonist, + the choice of what appears to be the main villain. I really hope it wont go there, but with our MC having literally no opinion on anything, it's a bit hard to tell how well the show will fair in this regard. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\\n\r\nIntersting style , with a good colour pallete, which both helps to connect the fantasy elemts to the modern ones. Funny enaugh, kind of similiar to Ouran high school host clubs style. Thou not in a bad way. The faces also don't look the same on every character, even the girls. That's nice. Not so nice is how stiff the movements seem. I suspect that they have a pretty tight budget; non detailed animation looks pretty bad, and they move very stiffly, if they move at all. They try to keep them as still aas possible. There are however no huge noticable quality drops. The style is still very refreching, managing to be dark and serious despite it's warm , nearly neon colours.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors all do a pretty decent job, but the dialoge is often pretty slow with wierd pauses. Some Seem to also not fully mash with the characterdesign/ expression shown on screen. May seem like a nitpick, but i really couldn't get used to it , and i binged the 10 episodes currently out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4)\\n\\n\r\nThis shiw has many, though they are easy to categorize. Smart and serious persuing their goals (now in the flavours good and evil),  dumb and/or naive while friendly and/or harmless (tend to be annoying, but generally ok) and quiet but competend. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC is one off the last group, though he is sadly the worst among them; he is just quiet and competend. No emotions whatsoever. Lukewarm on everything. Never angry or happy. Looks and acts as if he was about to fall asleep any second. I guess he's supposed to be cool. To me he only seems bored. It gets better as the show progresses, but it's still really off putting, and makes it difficult to get into the story. How is one supposed to connect to character, if they don't have any emotions. \\n\\n\r\nAlso many of the charcters are sterotypical for their role in the story, which in turn makes the story predictable. If they would have given some of them a better introduction or more actual character, it would have been more suspensefull.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the german \"names\" are all exeptionally dumb. Nouns aren't names. But that's more of a nitpick.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5)\\n\\n\r\nNice to look at, but the slow dialoge and sometimes obvious plot twists, combined with disconnect from the MC make it quit hard to chew. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\\n\r\nSlow with mediocre to boring charcters, but pretty neyt political worldbuilding. If that sounds good to you, it's worth a look. Still quite likely to turn into a   facist propaganda thing sooooo.......yeah. have fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you want a mistery / political drama anime, stop reading reviews and go watch the episodes!\r\nACCA 13 is one of those animes wich I recommend if you're tired of the usual moe-school animes, as a \"political\" drama , the anime is quite interesting.\r\nWhy do I like ACCA:13? Everything they show you has a secret. No-one is what they appear to be, have you ever wondered about your family past?, all those 'what if...?'... no, those are all things that just children have time to think about, you have to keep it up with your job, living your life day past day, giving yourboss all those reports you were assigned, everything is normal until one day, everyone starts looking at you, talking in a quiet voice everytime they see you in their district. That's Jean for you. Just another worker in the organization who pleads for peace, with a quite expensive adicction, cigars. I find Jean the perfect reflection of the world they show us in ACCA:13, people who just mind the present, people who doesn't wonder about whats above simply because, they don't think thats their business, until they're dragged into something big.\\n\\n\r\nIn only 9 episodes they have woven a complicated web of deceptions and cover-ups, and when you think everything is starting to be more clean, they lead you to another mistery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I find weak in this show? At first some of the plot twist start being \"obvious\" or \"stupid\" but after those; 'ACCA' started again.\\n\r\nApart from that, I had quite a problem with some of the characters since they seem to have quite an interesting background but are left behind to keep focusing on the main character, but this is -somewhat- fixed in the last episodes giving the series more flow.\\n\\n\r\nACCA 13 is not the typical action anime, it's first episodes are quite slow but, in my opinion, they do their work to start the machine and make us try to figure how *this* world works and how important some of the corporations or political figures matter to the coexistence of all the different districts.",

But in this case, things are different, there is a rumour of a Coup d'\u00e9tat imminent.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think this anime is a slice of life which promotes eating pastries. sweet bread, and smoking, and sure it does, but do not be fooled, if you watch closely you will notice certain details and follow the plot strongly, there is a Game of Thrones-esques intrigue going about it, and this does not help the fact that the Main Character is unintentionally involved with the Coup.\\n",

            "content": "ACCA is an anime in which nothing ever comes to fruition. Plot points are introduced and dissolved with no ripple effect whatsoever; all of the show's potential goes completely wasted on sandwich bread and cigarettes.\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\r\nWhile many of the characters are likeable, almost all of them are flat and uninteresting, including the protagonist, Jean.\r\nThe most interesting characters in the story are Jean's best friend Nino and one of the five chief officers of ACCA, Lilium. These are the two characters with the most thought put into their backstories and intentions.\r\nJean himself is the most boring character in the show. He doesn't seem to have anygoals or ambitions. He doesn't seem to have any drive or emotion. He's completely deadpan the entire time, at most cracking a smirk or raising an eyebrow. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nDo not be fooled: this is not an anime filled with political intrigue like all of the descriptions say. This is an anime about baked goods and cigarettes and I can't explain that any further without veering into spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nThe first seven episodes each spend time setting up dominoes only to knock them down the very same episode and then never address them again. If you only watch the first three episodes of the series, I will tell you now that you will never again hear of the serial arson plotline even though it goes completely unresolved. The same happens for every single interesting plot point that gets put forward. You spend 18 minutes excited to see how things all come together, then in the last 3 minutes before the end credits, Jean stumbles through, everything falls apart, no consequences are felt, and nothing changes. This is the cycle until Episode 8, when things finally pick up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist at the end of Episode 7 is where things get really interesting, even if you picked up on all the hints and saw it coming. Unfortunately, Episodes 8-11 are the only episodes worth watching, as Episode 12 completely shirks all of the buildup from the previous episodes and tries to tie everything up in a neat little bow. It's rushed. It makes no sense. Nothing gets resolved. Almost nothing is different from the beginning of the series from the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is 6/10 exclusively because Episodes 8-11 are excellent. Episodes 1-7 and 12 are a boring slog that focuses too much of their time in bakeries and not enough time addressing any of the actual issues Jean is meant to be investigating. If I were to give a score based on those episodes alone, I would give this section a 1/10. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10:\\n\r\nACCA's soundtrack isn't bad. You get some funky beats here and there, which can be fun if you're listening for them; otherwise, the music seems to fade too far into the background to notice. The OP track is a blast, and the ED is very pretty. The voice acting in the series is good, but nothing particularly notable. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only reason that I didn't score the art for ACCA a perfect 10 is because there are some clear corners that were cut in order to afford to make it as beautiful as it is. The show is almost like a painting come to life. The colours and linework are brilliant, and the lighting is always perfect. There are so many gorgeous shots littered throughout this anime, it's a wonder anyone manages to talk about anything else when it comes to this show. Annoyingly, most of the budget shows in the final episode, where every other shot shows characters without faces, even in close-up shots. \\n\\n\r\nIt pains me to score such a beautiful anime so low, but aesthetic is all ACCA brings to the table.",

            "content": "My Opinion:\r\nIn a world polluted with otaku-targeted shows, ACCA:13 feels like a breath of fresh air and stands out through its intriguing plot and character cast. \r\nFrom the beginning of this anime season I looked forward to watching ACCA:13, a show that conveys a delicate theme through an interesting, slow-burning plot accompanied by characters with intriguing personalities.\r\nThe animation worked in tandem with the sound department and offered an immersive experience in  which I could really enjoy the show to its fullest.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe kingdom of Dowa, which is subdivided into 13 autonomous states, has many agencies that are controlled by the giant organization known asACCA. \\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Jean Otus, the second-in-command of the ACCA inspection agency which is tasked with overseeing and monitoring the rest of the ACCA branch agencies. Jean often has business trips from the agency headquarters in the capital to the other 12 districts in order to review the situation and personnel there.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series begins, we are introduced to the protagonist who is tasked with auditing other ACCA agency branches and we witness his skills in uncovering even the smallest misdoings but we are also introduced to the \u201cmain\u201d plot, the coup d'etat. \\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes may be a tad bit boring because they focus on describing the world, introducing the characters and their relations but that is only to be expected of the first few episodes and in my opinion they did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nACCA does not have a particular selling point and it can be easily overlooked by the casual viewer due to its passive nature but in truth, ACCA is quite engaging and thought provoking.\\n\r\nThe plot progresses at a slow and methodical pace, carefully and subtly revealing information that will later be necessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mainly focused on presenting the characteristics, people and atmosphere of the districts, most episodes are built around the protagonist taking a business trip to one of the districts where he will audit, make observations and meet people that will describe the district. \\n\r\nAt times, the show may feel episodic but the coup d'etat plot will bring all those pieces together in a way that progresses the plot in a firm yet delicate manner that feels fluid. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nUnfortunately the majority of the large character cast lacks zest, most of them being \u201cdry\u201d and used for decor but there are some fairly original characters who definitely had intriguing features that aroused my interest.\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the characters do a great job, they work well together and give an immersive watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nJean Otus is the second-in-command of the ACCA inspection agency, a small branch that monitors the other branches. He is a compulsive smoker, always carrying around his trademark cigarette case, earning him the title of \"cigarette peddler\". He is also absent minded, often forgetting arranged plans or even his lighter despite his smoking habit.\\n\r\nThe first episode shows Jean on a regular weekday and we witness his skills in uncovering even the smallest misdoings, easily and cleverly exposing the corrupt worker.\\n\r\nJean maintains a dull uninterested demeanor, but has proven himself to be rather intelligent and sharp on more than one occasion.\\n\r\nHe is not an easy to read character, he is enigmatic. Jean doesn\u2019t offer his opinions but rather controls the flaw of the discussion, he doesn\u2019t make statements but rather observations, he is calm, honest and has a rational way of thinking.\\n\\n\r\nNino is a close friend of Jean\u2019s, an old friend he can be comfortable around and talk about his problems and worries but as the story unfolds, we find out Nino is more than just a good friend. Certain episodes will reveal Nino\u2019s true role but in the end, Nino has always respected the friendship he shares with Jean.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other characters worth mentioning such as Lotta (stress reliever), Mauve and the prince but they are not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is consistently good with nice character design and background art. The color palette fits the tone of the show, giving an overall pleasant watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is great and the ending theme was good, the background music was very well suited for the show, offering an immersive experience. The voice actors perfectly interpreted the characters and perfectly blended with the chill tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI found ACCA:13 to be a highly entertaining show that kept me pressing the \u201cnext\u201dbutton. I liked the plot and I think the characters were very good too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\r\nA surprisingly good show that I highly enjoyed. If you are looking for flashy fight scenes and hyped up moments, this is not the show you want, but in case you are lseeking a thought provoking show, I recommend giving ACCA:13 a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever feel like you just want to slouch on your couch and savor the taste of vintage fine wine? That's what the suave, stylistic ACCA feels like. It has a very sweet, but calming taste, it's never sharp, and is striking because of it. And on top of keeping such a presentation the show offers a perspective of many cultures and how they affect society. It's a road trip in aesthetic, but extremely political in essence. If raw exposition about political power moves and stances are not to you liking, then you won't like this show. To keep perspectives as they are, it is veryimpartial to all of them, and therefore very monotone. The most emotional engagement aside from a dry coup d'\u00c9tat intrigue plot, is the cute little sister with little screen time. And that's fine by me!  \\n\\n\\n\r\nACCA doesn't have an obvious selling point. It is what it says on the tin. Our protagonist goes to other districts to check up if they are doing everything within regulations. It's all about absorbing each district's unique flavor and atmosphere, how it has affected people's lifestyles and behaviours. How it softens them, how it hardens them with different resolves and different priorities.  \\n\r\nThe coup d'\u00c9tat plotline is merely used as an overarching subtext to have all these pieces come together into one who at the end. And it's all done through exposition dialogue that feels as natural as it can be. Everyone is an adult who is keenly aware of their situation, as much as the viewer at least, and slowly, people start revealing their hands and desires behind the masks of courtesy.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rather dry unfortunately. They are professionals and each one of them has a specific role to play.  \\n\r\nOur protagonist, Jean embodies this as well. His seemingly apathetic attitude is to give a grounding for the viewer, so we can intimately share his perspective. He doesn't offer his opinions much, he asks for them instead. Just like the viewer, he's absorbing the culture he's visiting. He doesn't want to influence it in any way. He's given a few badass points for being damn good at his job and sharp on the clues that are given to us. We know how the state of things are as he does, along with the twists and turns.  \\n\r\nNino serves as a shadow of Jean, an old, reliable buddy he can always be comfortable with and share his worries and troubles without any reprehension. Nino also plays a big role in the story, but he's always a loyal friend to Jean first and foremost.  \\n\r\nLotte is the cute girl that fills any scene with happiness and fluffiness. She relieves whatever tension there is from the coup d'\u00c9tat plot and its developments.  \\n\r\nAll the other characters are very much background dressing, and they are so many. Showing the show's commitment to its own fiction, giving it a face, a grounding for us to see people as they are, not as just human resources on a paper.  \\n\r\nAt worst, Jean and a few other characters are impenetrable, meaning, they don't emote, they simply fulfil their roles with little qualms or reaction. Due to that monotony of exposition dumps with small emotional subtext, it gets frustrating that there's seemingly nothing happening to anyone, no one is troubled, no one seems overly concerned to build some kind of actual tension or a motive you can get behind. And all the revelations are reserved until the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation is what truly holds the show together. The chill atmosphere, the slender character designs animated in a softer fashion. The watercolor backgrounds giving a very surreal, yet enamouring aesthetic from the urban district to the desert district. Again, all to underline the show's confidence in its own setting and writing. The character animations give them quite a bit more life and personality than usual, everyone has a certain movement, a tell to who they are and what they represent, besides their looks, or their roles.  \\n\\n\r\nAudio directing is on point throughout the show. Music helps set the mood of each scene and district, while the sound effects still provide for an immersive setting. The voice acting is monotone on purpose, but for once it feels like actual adults just exchanging daily words, keeping things professional, if impartial. Oh and let's not forget the smokin' OP. The ED is a good relief for a chill show that just went by with no effort, yet all the cerebral engagement of how every piece fits in the jigsaw puzzle that is the coup.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the end, ACCA is a pure cerebral experience, held by its chill attitude and suave aesthetic. It doesn't offer much in terms of emotional engagement, but it's not a bad price to pay for a show that is mentally engaging, yet weirdly comfy. It's very easy to appreciate its commitment to world building and an intrigue narrative. And I loved every second of this experience.",

You can chill and watch, but if you chill too much, you might miss out on all the little details.\r\n7/10 story: \r\nStory isn't complex or anything, but it still keeps you guessing. You at times wonder where the story is going and who to trust and who not to trust. What is this guy planning? What about that guy? As a viewer, I felt like Tony Soprano at the end of The Sopranos. Paranoid as fuck and kept yelling at the screen,\"No, don't trust that guy!\" and then when itturns out my guess was wrong, I'd turn to the next character and be like,\"Oh, hell no! Definitely don't trust that guy!\" This anime felt like something that could of happened irl and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 art: \\n\r\nThe animation is pretty consistently well done. I like the character designs and etc. Nothing else to really say, but if you're not convinced, it's animated by Madhouse. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 sound:\\n\r\nThere were quite a few good openings this season, but this one was just so damn catchy! The osts and everything. Even the ending song. Every sound this anime made got my ears attention. This anime had the best sound out of any anime I've heard this season. I put the volume way higher whenever I came back to this anime weekly. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 character:\\n\r\nThere's quite a few characters that were interesting. Like Jean, Niino.. Actually, there's quite a lot of characters that had interesting traits. Jean's not give a fuck attitude, Niino had the is he best friend or just a job thing going on, a lot of people were schemers, and a lot of people liked bread lol. But with such a huge cast of characters and the focus always shifting to Jean, I tend to forget some characters. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 enjoyment: \\n\r\nIt was slow, but the sound, guesses on what's what, relaxing type anime really made me enjoy this anime for what it was. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 overall:\\n\r\nThis is the type of anime where I probably wouldn't watch again because guessing what would happen is a huge chunk of the fun, but for a first watch it was pretty damn fun.",

            "content": "The concept of a coup de\u2019tat, in which a plot is developed to overthrow a populace\u2019s own government, has been around for centuries. In fact, the history goes back as far as 870 B.C. in which an Israeli commander Zimri killed his own king to commandeer the throne for himself (he later committed suicide due to talks of being overthrown by his own subordinate- karma\u2019s a bitch, eh?). Most recently, our Lord and Savior, Studio Madhouse adapted a little known manga, ACCA, which primarily centers itself around this historical theme. With rather mixed impressions, ACCA attempts to overthrow anime stereotypes with its atypical approach whilealso looking to become a future cult classic.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Jean Otus, an inspector for ACCA, an organization created after an ugly coup de\u2019tat dismantled the previous country Dowa\u2019s authority. He's tasked with performing a short-cycled audit of each of the countries 13 regions, recognized for his supreme skill to uncover even the faintest trace of malpractice. Jean has to deal with the stress of auditing in addition to lofty rumors that he may be involved with some deep rooted plotting of his own. What follows is a slow burning story of politics, royalty, deception and secrecy. ACCA is most certainly an anime to be overlooked by the casual viewer, due to its passive nature. But underneath the political rhetoric and lack of action is a gripping plot to note. It has a marked plot twist, which caught me completely off guard without being unfounded. The characters have deeper agendas not worn on their sleeves, and nobody is who they appear to be. I thoroughly enjoyed dissecting the intricate details of each scene looking for clues to the next story turn.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I personally enjoyed the approach, many will be quick to disregard the series based on its slow, methodical episodes. Not a lot seems to be purposeful on the first pass through, but the copious amounts of foreshadowing and allusion to other events make it worthwhile in the end. It's an anime best watched in one big chunk like an extended film rather than week to week, one of its greatest downfalls. In addition to the pacing, if you're looking for action for this Winter season past a stern one way conversation\u2026 I'd advise you look to Youjo Senki or Kobayashi Dragon Maid to get your fix. ACCA, as previously mentioned, is a slow burning anime putting the cerebral first, while flashy, fast-paced scenes take a firm backseat.\\n\\n\r\nThe parallels to modern day government and royalty can be easily made, however the setting for ACCA appears to be entirely unique to our world. Some normal commodities in our countries (cigarettes, sweets) are quite rare in Jean\u2019s world, and being deemed as \u201cthe cigarette pedeller\u201d, he finds himself the topic of much scrutiny wherever he travels. Having previously served in the military myself, I could sympathize with a lot of the procedural and inspection-based lingo present within the more militant scenes. The writers also did a rather accurate job of emulating the true feel of exhaustion emoted by Jean as he traveled through the many regions to perform his duties. Often turning to drink despite his inability to hold his liquor, Jean\u2019s languid nature is catalyzed when alcohol is involved. His best friend Niino, whose association is a mystery, often keeps Jean company amidst his various endeavors. \\n\\n\r\nJean Otus as a main protagonist is rather uninteresting. He doesn't get excited about much, his appearance is rather plain and he doesn't have many friends. He's your typical introvert, who would rather spend a weekend at home in tranquility than trek around bars with his coworkers (I can totally relate to this). His parents died in a tragic train accident several years ago, and was obligated to be the primary caretaker for his younger sister Lotto, due mostly to her much younger age and maturity level. Much like you would expect from a hermit like Jean, his feelings are shown rather than told to the viewers, resulting in a higher difficulty to relate on an emotional level to him throughout the anime. Although I won't give too much away, there may be a deeper reason the writers chose  Lotto is flighty and carefree, often subdued by the appearance of a doughy pastry or cake, but she stands by Jean\u2019s side despite their stark differences.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters, though not fully explored due to a lack of air time, have their fair share of mysteries as well. Whether it's the secret meetings Jean undergoes with the Director-General or the convenient \u201cbusiness trips\u201d Niino travels to, each episode unveils another small piece of the pie. I do wish some more time would've been spent on the side characters in order to fully understand the story, but I'm often overexpectant in 12 episode anime. Nothing new here.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that I like the art style Madhouse had the freedom to use in ACCA. Though not \u201cgreat\u201d by modern anime standards, the animation is consistent, which is more than I can say for some other action oriented shows out there. And even though I normally despise this comment, \u201cit stayed true to the manga\u201d. The character designs, including the incorporation of the military uniforms were reminiscent of my younger years. Unique, but familiar enough to invoke some slight nostalgia.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP might be my favorite of the season. It incorporates a jazzy beat with a powerful and catchy chorus. The added collage of vivid images almost tells us a story of how the anime unfolds. I would imagine that Mother\u2019s Basement guy from YouTube would get his jollies from interpreting this opening. The ED is pretty standard and delicate, and I often found found myself skipping it altogether. The background music had some serious Speed Grapher/Bebop vibes, and were certainly better placed than the first of those anime. Seiyus did a decent job providing some convincing in their portrayals, but really no breakout performances here.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I'm in the minority when it comes to my enjoyment of ACCA. Modern anime is laden with goofy, bombastic characters, glitzy action and panty shots galore. The best part? ACCA has none of these. So, if you're looking for a show that breaks the mold in almost every possible way, or are growing tired of the gimmicky cash grabs pilfered at anime fans, I'd recommend checking it out. It is a great candidate for a \u201chidden gem\u201d if given the proper care while watching it, and a series I'm glad I picked up this season. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter \u201817 reviews!\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nEnjoyment-8\\n\r\nOverall-7.2",

            "content": "From the start of the season this was the thing I was the most excited about. While it did have its good points, it ultimately became the thing that most disappointed me of the Winter 2017 season. I will now proceed to tell you why in EXCRUCIATING detail. \r\nOur setting is the Kingdom of Dowa: a continent/kingdom made up of many districts, shaped like a bird, and populated by gangly noodle-people. Our hero is Jean Otus, a blond guy who smokes cigarettes, wears jackets, and works in the titular governmental organization ACCA as some sort of district inspector. This is about all we know abouthim. Also he has a sister and a friend with blue hair.\\n\\n\r\nJean is tasked with visiting the various districts of Dowa and \"auditing\" them, which consists of 50% looking through file cabinets at papers in a very boring way and 50% coincidentally stumbling into dramatic events that all seem to center around Jean while somehow also not involving him at all. Superficially tense political games and a lot of talking ensue.\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\r\nA.) It looks awesome. ACCA has a very distinct visual style, managing to be both vibrant and relaxed. It has the feel of a watercolor painting: colorful but also a bit ethereal. \\n\r\nB.) Both the OP and ED are great, the first being a fun cool colorful romp and the second a stunningly animated tranquil dance scene. \\n\r\nC.) I mostly really like the characters, with Jean himself being the notable and unfortunate exception. He is either very subtle or very boring, and unfortunately we find out by the end that he is very much the latter. I ended up having to look up his name to write this review, because I couldn't remember if it was \"Jean\" or \"Jin.\" All the side characters are fun and interesting, so that\u2019s something.  \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nA.) As mentioned before, Jean himself. Everybody in the show itself seem to think he is the greatest most interesting shit in the world. Either he is a secret genius who is playing his cards SUPER close to the vest and not showing us any of it, or he isn't and is actually the most boring man in the world whose only personality trait seems to be that he is a smoker.\\n\r\nB.) The pacing is garbage. It is SLOW and feels SLOOWER. \\n\r\nC.) Like Mushishi it is not in a rush to get anywhere, but unlike Mushishi it ultimately never does. The story immediately lags and it gets boring quickly.\\n\r\nD.) It is not in the least bit exciting. There have been moments of charm that have made me want to get more, but they are not frequent enough to make me instantly want to watch another episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the show by the end was that nobody changed or developed in the slightest. They are all exactly the same at the end of the show as they were at the start. The sad truth is that the character that underwent the most development was the coddled prince\u2019s servant Magie, whose development consists of him learning that he likes bread.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of anime get criticized for being nothing but talking, but beside eating bread and smoking cigarettes more or less nothing else occurred in 12 episodes. It was constant exposition that ended up settling up nothing. It is a crying shame because the characters look great and the world is super cool, but the show reminded me of a Kardashian in that it looks pretty and very effortfully crafted but is ultimately unengaging because it is devoid of any depth or interest. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT AHEAD\\n\\n\r\n\tIt doesn\u2019t matter anyway because you shouldn\u2019t watch the show, and it won\u2019t ruin anything because there is nothing to ruin, but I though I\u2019d warn you. It seems only polite. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMost of the previous complaints I have about this show disappointed me, but this one pissed me the f off. The only \u201cbad\u201d people in this show are brown, and the only brown people in this show are \u201cbad.\u201d The show also does a great job of very pointedly not calling them \u201cArabs,\u201d which just serves to call attention to the brown skinned, oil wealthy, immoral, racist elephant in the room. Literally the only people of color of any significance in this entire postulated world are portrayed as greedy manipulative villains. In the end they choose to just go away and sit in the corner so all the white people can resume their blissful perfect lives. I will also add that I, myself, am white as the driven snow. I am not saying this out of any feelings that the show has attacked me personally. It was so blatant that it made me, not a target of the seemingly intentional demonization of a group of people, feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Do better guys. We are better than this. \\n\\n\r\nSo Jean is, in fact, playing a long game, but unfortunately that long game turns out to be Monopoly: the most tedious, dialogue heavy, longest game of all. His master plan is literally designed to ensure that nothing will change, and that the huge amount of narrative debt that the show has built up after 12 episodes of stoic talky political drama is entirely unpaid. Every single problem presented throughout the run of the show is wrapped up in a neat little bow with no bloodshed or ill will. Except, of course, on the part of the brown people, but as we have previously established they do not matter due to the fact that they are brown because they are evil and evil because they are brown. It is so painfully contrived and saccharine that it made me a little embarrassed to watch on behalf of the writer. \\n\\n\r\nAs if to drive my point home, the last line of dialogue in the show is \u201cWe really haven\u2019t changed, have we?,\u201d with the feeling that it is being delivered directly to camera with a cheeky wink. No, ACCA, you have not. But I have. At the beginning I kind of liked you. Here at the end I have nothing but disappointment and pity left for what you could\u2019ve been.",

We are 4 episodes into it and the setup seems great. Also the setting was fairly unique(Not high school or Video game) \\n\r\nAt this point anything could happen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where the show really got me. Seeing the same shit again and again had become boring. At first it doesn't seem that the characters are all that special(But their personality traits are reviled one by one subtly) and  their variety was pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not bad but nothing of incredible consequence\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation style is unique. Personally I like the animation style. I'd say animation quality is constant unlike shows like Haikyuu!! or Yuri on Ice where it peaks and then drops. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI understand why some people might not like this show. Since it starts of slow, flashy stuff doesn't happen frequently and the mood is fairly calm.\\n\r\nBut why does a show have to do flash stuff or bring eccentric or absolutely stupid characters. \\n\\n\r\nI think as the show goes on people will start to appreciate the show because of how well the story will develop. I hope that the industries will produce more of such audio visual content in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Ah ACCA, a title that took me by surprise as we witness this anime adaptation by Natsume Ono. I have to admit, the show is hard to accept at first. The premise sounds like something from 1984 and mixes in police drama with political affairs. First impressions of the show can really be a make or break for viewers to continue watching. As such, I suggest watching ACCA with an open mind because by doing that, you can enjoy the storytelling much easier.\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, the storytelling moves at a pretty slow pace. It takes patience to accept the story because the first few episodesdecides to focus a lot more on building the world setting. In the Kingdom of Doma, there are 13 districts. ACCA is an organization that provides services to each of these distinct services. The show focuses on a man named Jean Otus, the second command of ACCA as he gets himself involved in a complex affair of events that may even include a coup d'\u00e9tat. As you can imagine, this builds up the story as each episode bring in together pieces and pieces like a puzzle. In the meantime, we can get to see the inner workings and affairs going on in Doma. To say the least, the world building of this show has a lot of interesting qualities. Each district has their own unique society that differs from each other. While the show doesn\u2019t fully explore every district, it gets its point across that there are conflicting struggle between some sides. \\n\\n\r\nFor most parts, the characters in the show are fleshed out by their positions (often ranks) and their personality. Jean is the main guy we\u2019ll get familiar with the most. He is enigmatic and difficult to read on the surface. He also loves to smoke and is often seen with a cigarette in his mouth. With such a mysterious character, you\u2019ll definitely find him difficult to understand although his approach at dealing with certain situations is insightful. His sister, Lotta is just the opposite as she is often cheerful and has a big appetite for sweets. At times, it will feel like they are living in different worlds apart. As the show progresses, we also learn more about the other ACCA members. Characters such as Grossular will be a challenge for Jean to overcome as he suspects the latter of being involved in a coup to overthrow the king. Some of his character also suggests Grossular may be the one involved in the coup himself. Either way, the show does a decent job at making the audience anticipate what will happen next with these characters. On the opposite spectrum, there are guys like Lilium who dismisses Jean as being possibly involved in the coup. At the center of it, we also meet Mauve, the director general of ACCA. She is the one that actually believes a coup may end up happening and gets Jean involved in the investigation. A mysterious character like herself is quite admiring as she demonstrates leadership characteristics. Her role in the show can be determined easily although the audience will have to judge on whether her approach to certain situations as right or wrong. Finally, I have to admit that the Prince of Doma Kingdom is really hard for me to accept. We even learn a bit of background story about certain royalty and as interesting as it seems, it isn\u2019t what I find too accepting. \\n\\n\r\nNow I have to admit, ACCA\u2019s storytelling is rather predictable. Certain revelations can be easily drawn from hints and speculations, some that can be easily recognized. While that\u2019s not really impressive to go by, it does like to also take risks to flesh out certain characters\u2019 motives. One of the more dynamic character relationships is between Jean and Nino. Now, Nino is a close friend of Jean\u2019s and throughout the show, we find out that he appears to be a lot more than just being his friend. Certain episodes will reveal his true role as we see how his relationship with Jean develop from certain revelations. The key success though is the background story. Even as predictable as the show can be at times, we learn why characters\u2019 roles are played out like the way they do. ACCA succeeds at pulling the trigger to executing characters\u2019 roles while all the time getting viewers invested about their motivations. Whether you\u2019ll enjoy this show with that aspect though is up to you.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Madhouse studio, the show has a very distinctive feel at adapting the art style. The unique approach that director Seiko Yoshioka really is dynamic when you look at it carefully. Every district has their own style while the royal palace stands as the most noticeable structure. The character designs have a good degree of freedom. Characters such as Jean are given simple appearances to make them not stand out while others such as characters from royalty are given more flameboyant-like appearances. The designs aren\u2019t entirely faithful to the manga though as it does look different. Also, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed the momentum of the artwork. While character expressions are well delivered, the show feels very static at times that almost feels like a picture drama. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to music, ACCA excels at this field thanks to Ryo Takahashi\u2019s talent. The directing of the soundtrack and music really brings this show to life. The piano-like rhythms and melody of each episode is dynamic while the theme songs are choreographed with a unique approach. Character voice mannerism isn\u2019t to be underestimated either especially for characters like Mauve, Nino, and even Jean himself. \\n\\n\r\nACCA 13-ku Kansatsu-ka (ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept.) is a difficult show to recommend to anyone. Any fan of police drama who is interested in world building may get a better experience than others. If you\u2019re looking for action, then this is definitely the wrong show to invest time in. ACCA is much more about what is on the surface but rather the internal affairs that goes on behind the scenes. The complex characters offers a mature approach style of storytelling without going overboard. In the meantime, ACCA\u2019s pacing will hinder some viewers into spending more time to watch the show. However, I would definitely put time into this series as it offers so much more than what it just looks like.\\n",

There are strong cases to be made why this show was interesting and why it was boring, but we'll get to that. But why the polarization? Isn't this series slick as hell? Well...\\n\\n\r\nTo a decent extent, the story is meticulously written in terms of creating a mystery full of twists and turns. It all surrounds Jean Otus, a man working for ACCA that is currently doing audits while the prince of the nation is not only coming of age but is ready to succeed the throne. Problem number 1 is that the story really dead its feet with nothing to truly hook us for more aside from hoping that it will all explode into a chaotic and flavorful conclusion towards the final act; it doesn't. It's understandable why this turns people off, as the show feels uneventful. Two, some of these twists were both obvious and poor. The final antagonist was one of the royals whom we had never even heard of until 2/3 into the series, with two of the ACCA 5 Chief Officers being antagonists with their own separate plot. If you're anything like me, you suspected the two that turned out to be antagonists, and there was only 1 other person to remotely suspect, who isn't involved, but there could've been more flavor to the mystery by giving reason to suspect more people. \\n\\n\r\nSo, because Jean was suspected of being involved in an upcoming coup, his friend, Nino, is sent to spy on him, but then it's revealed that he is next in like to be king, which is why the rumor was created, in order to get the 13 districts on his side during his audits. Sounds fine and dandy, and for most part, it is, including the somewhat rushed backstory of Nino, Jean, and his sister, Lotta. It's thanks to that that the aunt of the family wants them dead, as well as the dickheaded prince himself. As for the finale, it was ok. It was interesting to see the whole coup resolve peacefully but with more twists, but there was no reason for the aunt to suddenly abandon her plan.\\n\\n\r\nTell me, who do you remember besides Jean and Nino? Probably nobody because these characters are mostly dull and one-note. Jean is pretty listless, by it is nice seeing him get flustered over his crush/superior Mauve, though that fades quickly. He also smokes...a lot. Just like on older times, in this anime, smoking is a sign of wealth and he gets misconstrued because of it, particularly when confronted by Rail, who acts like an ass around him and likes his sister. Nino is a slick guy, even in spy mode, but he's merely ok. Mauve, Lotta, and Gossular are merely ok, and most of the characters are boring, like prince Schwan, the aunt, the spoiler manipulator in the 5 Chief Officers, and each of Jean's subordinates and audit companions. We could've easily spent a bit more time about the characters but instead, we chose to do more audits and see the main 3 eat apple pie and drink alcohol. Like the plot, the interesting potential really fizzes out, which is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nTo this day, I'm not sure how to feel about the art-style. However, what is something I'm sure of is that the series is clearly not in 24FPS. The animation is rather choppy, making it feel like the series runs at only 16 frames per second instead of the minimum required 24 for everything to feel like they're in constant motion. I'm not sure if this is an artistic choice, but I don't think it works. I at least like the hair and food detail, as well as the detail in the casino lights in episode 8. The OP has amazing artistic flair to the way it looks, and the ED has another type of interesting art that is actually more fluid than the entirety of the actual series, which is kinda sad the more you think about it. After all, you'd probably expect better from Studio Madhouse since Studio DEEN did more fluid and striking animation with their also more methodical and realistic series, Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu. Thankfully the mediocre CGI is insanely minimal to the point where most people would find it nonexistent, even if some of the character faces are actually incomplete in the final episodes and the background characters often fit move in scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is pretty nice and fitting, especially the jingle at the beginning and middle of episode 1. It fits the calmer, more lax and methodical nature of the series perfectly, preventing me from really getting bored, but that didn't stop some people from boredom. The OP, \"Shadow and Truth\" by ONE III NOTES is pretty cool, with surprisingly good J-rap and a great female singer (even during autotune sections). There's a reason people say this is one of the best OPs of the season, it's pretty freakin' slick. As for the ED, \"Pale Moon ga Yureteru (\u30da\u30fc\u30eb\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u304c\u3086\u308c\u3066\u308b)\" by Aira Yuuki, is a pretty alright theme meant for some bit of emotion after each episode. Not great but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub, it's rather good. J Michael Tatum was in charge of ADR direction and we get some rather fitting boxes for many of the characters, especially Jean and Nino. It's weird to hear someone sound like Steve Blum without being Steve Blum, but that's been an issue in the dubbing industry for a good year now (where new actors sound like old ones, and this was exposed to be a major problem in the acting industry in Japan). It feels like the character art-style lends itself to both the dub and the sub rather well, and the dub worked just as well as the sub, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I was pretty intrigued by the narrative, even if it did get a bit dull towards the end. The atmosphere was pretty enjoyable, and the OP was so damn good that I just wanna bob my head and snap to the beat every time. It was surprisingly enjoyable if a bit lacking in the satisfaction department. T'was a nice enough time, but there wasn't enough pizzazz to give real flavor to the experience, making it somewhat underwhelming. It's by no means a bad show, but there's no way in hell this'll be smoking the competition for any \"best of winter 2017\" lists, I'm sure. It didn't rise up high, but it was decent and slick while it lasted, so that's alright, I guess. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "ACCA is a story that says to hell with expectations and preconceived notions on what makes anime good, throwing the staples of anime tradition to the wayside in favor of a more subtle, nuanced approach to storytelling.\r\nAs such, It should come to no surprise to know that this winter season\u2019s ACCA has dissenting opinions among the anime community. Some people have cited it as \u2018People talking, the anime.\u2019\r\nAfter all, the show doesn\u2019t aim to dazzle us in the way we\u2019ve come to expect from traditional series\u2014 there are no explosive visuals, no internal monologue, no signature moves or battles, nor is there any trademark fanserviceto feast on\u2014 there\u2019s just our protagonist Jean Otus and his day-to-day dialogues with people as he does his job. The show\u2019s lowkey vibes will fool the more passive viewers \u2013 the ones used to anime that panders to their senses \u2013 into believing there\u2019s nothing there. Much of the action and excitement of ACCA comes from deciphering the dialogue to find the hidden meanings behind character\u2019s intents.\\n\\n\r\nACCA asks us to work for it \u2014 to think about what lies beneath the exterior \u2014 informing us that we need to tread carefully, lest we become victims to false expectations. This should be alarming to the army of anime viewers that have been spoiled with the rush of instant gratification and exposition. To fully enjoy ACCA, we need to drop all assertions of the medium and have patience. In a series subtlety unveiling key plot points through character interactions and nuance of expressions, the responsibility lies with us, the viewer, to avoid being entangled in the web of deceit woven by dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Jean Otus, shows a carefulness about himself and how he approaches the world. He exudes a calm and collected demeanor that permeates the atmosphere of the narrative at surface level. Armed with astute observations and skepticism, he is aware that everyone is attempting to appeal to his simple pleasures. He plays characters attempts at manipulation with a cool, enigmatic indifference.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is, we can\u2019t really tell what anyone is thinking in the series \u2014 there\u2019s no way to know because we can\u2019t see into the character\u2019s thoughts -- and that's where the appeal is. ACCA gradually and intricately weaves a plot entangled in mystery. We\u2019re forced to follow the breadcrumbs given to us through exploring what is said and seen. ACCA\u2019s allure thus, lies in its ability to engage the audience, telling you that truth is somewhere just beyond the lies. The series calls upon us to be active participants of the medium to get more out of it.\\n\\n\r\nACCA tells us that the very notion of expectations is the enemy. The scenes with food aren\u2019t there as simple filler, as one may think, but rather to showcase the contradictory nature of people and the allure of simple delights.\\n\\n\r\nWhich comes back to why ACCA isn\u2019t as popular as some of the other series of the winter. Those idly sitting by, waiting for their usual visual feasts simply won\u2019t get it. They\u2019re not accustomed to being active participants \u2014 to the intricacies and delights of subtle narration ACCA thrives under. The series is deceptively lowkey, and many have fallen prey to its subtleties. But if you take a closer look, approaching with an open mind, a rich and flavorful world is out there, ripe and ready, waiting to be sampled. \\n\\n\r\n-- Palpable \u10e6\u309d\u25e1\u2579)\u30ce\u2661\\n\\n\r\nFor the full review, visit my website at https://palpableemotion.com\\n\\n",

            "content": "ACCA is a slow burning political drama centered around a rumored coup d'\u00e9tat and set in the fantastical yet embedded in reality DOWA kingdom. It has a very rich style, a laid back intrigue and a cast of cool characters - that come more into the light as the plot develops in the second half. Through the world building, it made me care about what was happening to DOWA and the possibilities of where it was heading. \r\nThe land is segregated into thirteen unique and natural states based upon the history, government infrastructure and resources. The protagonist,  Jean, has a job to audit eachof these states, to check up on how things are going in this time of assumed peace. The world building is split into roughly one state per episode but there is a multi-layered world building approach; while you only really explore one state at a time, you can see how the characters compare the similarities and differences to each of the other states, which makes the world feel alive and interconnected. \\n\\n\r\nLike with the world, the characters also have a feeling of where you are only seeing the tip of the ice berg, and by piecing new information together, you eventually get a solid understanding of each of the characters. At first Jean appeared as being solely aloof and studious yet as you see how he handles situations and the thought processes he uses to deduct his response, it makes him become warmer and personable. As with his relationship with Crow and his sister, which is quiet fun in a subdued way. Most of the characters feel like they play an important part of DOWA and the side characters have there motivations revealed, although besides from hints they don't all become clear until the final few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show steeped in politics, there is plenty of crushes that inhabit a number of characters, and while it never bore any fruit, it was nice to highlight aspects of there personality of what they are attracted too as well with how they deal with that feeling. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style looks mature but with a quirky edge like the abundance of mustaches, hair styles, fashion and fantastical looking food. I'm not sure if it was just a ploy to show a hereditary link between a few of the characters, but there is definitely a bread cult going on. There is a jazzy beat throughout which works well with the other worldly elements, quirky design choices and the cool headed characters. The framing of the landscape in relation to the characters was solid, there were occasionally goofy faceless moments but a lot of the time there was both a detailed background and characters kept on model. Apparently fingers are difficult to animate, so kudos to that.    \\n\\n\r\nACCA relishes in its style and develops its world and characters in a slow but constant pace. While not being particularly exciting to watch, I was always interested in to see what would happen next, what new piece of information would be revealed and what delicious looking food would appear. Like with the bread in the show, their lies a warm, well woven, bite sized meal that satiates in a simple and effective way. \\n\\n\r\n*passes jean a cigarette* /10",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nSend feedback if you have any\r\nACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. What an incredible piece of art. What seems like a simple story, a kingdom separated into 13 districts looked after by the organisation known as ACCA, manages to keep you guessing on how exactly everything is going to turn out. We follow Jean Otus, second-in-command of ACCA's inspection department, who travels to each and every district to make sure that any signs of corruption is discovered and prevented quickly. Starting off slow to introduce characters and some world building, the story steadily opens up to what can only be described, in the most non-spoilerway possible, as a quiet but planned out struggle for peace threatened by a higher power.\\n\\n\r\nWhat seems predictable at first, (oh a plot twist happens, I can see where this is going) continues to surprise you as you can never guess what is actually happening until the very end. The calm and cool atmosphere that surrounds most of the series lulls you into a sense of knowing more than you actually do, allowing it's unpredictable nature to continuously keep the show interesting. Secrets are revealed, plans are put into motion, multiple opposing views wait their turn to make sure that events are headed towards their favour. It's a perfect example of the phrase \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\\n\\n\r\nJean Otus is a simple but slightly mysterious man. Known by others as the \"Cigarette Peddler\", he's often seen with a lighter in his hand a smoke in his mouth. Not much is really known about Jean at the start. His only real goal that is revealed to us is that he wants to get a transfer to a different department. What could be seen as a dull and boring personality, this character manages to give off a feeling that he's much more intelligent than he seems. We see glimpses of his unique mind at work as he deals with some problems he faces in a few districts, showing off that he's actually more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nNino is also pretty mysterious. Reporter by day, he often joins Jean for a drink and a talk about their hard days at work. He could be seen as quite charismatic and a smooth talker, always hanging around our main and his sister Lotta. Not much is known about him at first, but slowly his secrets are also revealed to showcase a truly interesting character with a simple motive. Look out for the Otus family.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to talk about every character due to the large amount we are introduced to every episode, as Jean travels from district to district, and the fact that many of the main cast's characteristics may lead to accidental spoilers. While character development is usually focused on only a select few of frequently reoccurring faces, every person we meet along the journey is able to feel interesting. Although most fall into the background, each character has their own personality and goals for their own district and for ACCA as a whole. There enough development left over that is scattered to various members of the supporting cast that it feels like everyone Jean meets has a sense of realism that is hard to achieve in most animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is oddly unique yet similar to other shows at the same time. With a slight sketchbook like appearance, the art style really matches its relaxing atmosphere. It's not anything eye-popping, but it really adds to the show's mood of peacefulness. Even the hairdo of each character is special, as most districts have their own distinct hair colour. It's a subtle clue as to some important parts of the story, hidden incredibly well so only people that already know how the story progressions will be able to spot it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not often you find a show that has such an amazing story, drawing you in with each episode that passes. This show does take a bit of patience as it doesn't dive into the actual plot right away, but if you don't mind a slow but interesting series, then I highly recommend this.",

            "content": "ACCA was an anime released last year, Winter season. When I first read the plot of the story, I was kinda hesitant. I find it quite boring and too \u2018serious\u2019 for my liking (at that time). I thought to myself that this anime would be better if I binge-watch it when I\u2019m in a mood for a \u2018relaxing\u2019 and \u2018lazy\u2019 animes. Infairness, I was right.\r\nThis anime was indeed a surprise. I didn\u2019t expect I would like this show. I enjoyed watching this anime without worries. Just sitting back, relaxing on my chair and eating snacks. It was that laid-back. The last time I watched ananime that gave me this kind of feels was flying witch anime. It\u2019s been awhile.  Everything about this anime was done right. From the story to the music, I have no complaints, only compliments. But I still try to find some faults, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was solid from start to finish. Excellent writing. It felt like each conversation was really important, I can\u2019t skip even one. At the same time, I\u2019m not stressed thinking about the story. It was paced well, watching the series made me feel like I was watching a really really good old classic western movie. The ending satisfied my soul, it was executed really well. The world building of the story was also laid out in a way that its not drowning the viewers with too much information. I think one of the flaws of the story would be the slow and tone-down pacing in the first few episodes. It wasn\u2019t for everyone, that\u2019s why there were some people who dropped this series right off the bat. But still, the story and how it was build-up were definitely one of the strong factors of this series.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect this series would have quite a lot of characters. Cuz they were too many of them, I couldn\u2019t memorise all their names. I only recognise each of them by their distinct look. The character designer did really well in making sure each one of them are unique from each other. But even with this unique qualities, most of the characters suffered a lot in the character development area. I think only the \u2018important\u2019 characters got the right amount of character development, but the others\u2026..nah. It was either not worthy of sharing or not relevant in the story. Still, each one of them were likeable at to some extent. And oh, Lotta is best little sister. I want a sister like her.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned above about how well-drawn each character of the anime. Even though most of them looks like each other, they were still unique. The art style was really unique. It felt like I had seen them before but I can\u2019t pinpoint what or when. The art definitely contribute in giving off the vibe of a western classic movie. Let us not forget the animation. It was really good. Like the art, the animation was done well. As expected from Madhouse studio. Even though they had been on decline lately, they still continue to blow my mind with a really really good release. The animation was like no other. It fitted well with the atmosphere and tone of the series. I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound were absolutely fantastic. I had heard quite a lot of praises with the OP song, after hearing it myself, Dang, it was good. It was so good, I even have the song right now on repeat on my phone. It was so catchy yet laidback. Very groovy but also smooth in the ears. I had eargasms every time I start a new episode. The ED was really good too, but it didn\u2019t liven up to the standards of the OP. I wasn\u2019t able to listen well to the sound in the background. I was too relax and focus on the story, I forgot to notice the music in the background. Dunno if what i did was a bad thing or a good thing. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was solid as rock. It was a really amazing experience, watching this series. Definitely a must binge-watch.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "ACCA definitely feels like an unusual show in our current anime climate, with its leisurely pace and art style. It's populated by gaunt, bishounen-style male characters of the kind you thought went out of fashion in the early 2000s, which is refreshing to see. But the best thing about ACCA is how a deeply comfortable and alluring show manages to blindside you with an exciting story.\r\nThe first half of ACCA plays out like a combination of food porn and travelogue, as protagonist Jean travels to his country's various picturesque regions, meeting people and devouring sweet bread. Tidbits of plot are revealed, but everything bubbles inthe background and the viewer is lead to believe that this will be a slice-of-life show, maybe with some shounen-ai queer-baiting. ACCA's episodic nature, beautiful art direction, and dreamy jazz soundtrack all contribute to crafting a show that's just nice to spend time with.\\n\\n\r\nBut surprisingly enough, the story takes form very quickly in the latter half of the show, without sacrificing its sense of pace or meandering nature. It's not a highly complicated story, but it heightens the viewer's awareness of what's going on in the background, and pieces fall into place at just the right time to have an impact. The final wallop of revelations at the very end only makes it feel more satisfying. Again, it's nothing mind-blowing, it's just told in a way that feels like it matters. I feel like it's mostly because ACCA is very character-centric, and the way in which characters react to events feels organic, but also reveals new depths to them.\\n\\n\r\nIn that sense, my major complaint with ACCA is that some supporting characters simply don't get enough screen time for us to get even mildly acquainted with them, when you can clearly tell that they are supposed to have some kind of background to them. I hate it when shows dangle characters in my face but then do absolutely nothing with them (see Durarara!!) because they ran out of time. It's just a \"read the manga\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I greatly enjoyed my time with ACCA and I'm pretty confident I'll be watching it again soon, because it's the kind of show that gets better with multiple viewings. It's probably not for everyone--aesthetically it's very out-of-pace with current anime trends--but it's just the kind of thing I love.",

But god, this is a show anime needs really, really badly.\r\nIt respects its audience enough to put 2 and 2 together - and though not all too difficult to piece together, it is a story with a lot of nuance, and one I am eager to see progress.\r\nPlease watch this. The first episode is long-ish and boring, but if you don't have ADHD, I'm certain you'll enjoy it. \r\nThe art is amazing, the occasional symbolismmakes you go \"ooooh\" not \"I get it already\", the color palettes make me swoon, the food looks great - the only \"issue\" with the art is that their noses are uber-pointy.

            "content": "Some shows bore me to tears and feel like a chore to get through. ACCA however has the privilege of being a show that bored me into a strange cozy state of submission. It is a slice-of-life political thriller like no other.\r\nIt starts off with the art and music, which immerses you into the world with a colorful yet not overdone palette, accompanied by lounge-like piano music that doesn't dare to raise your heartbeat by even a smidgeon. This choice of tone manages to make the events on screen feel more grounded, but add to this some cinematography that's just kinda passable, and you alsohave a show that suffers from being very mundane in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are in a similar situation. Despite having varied designs and backstories, somehow they all seem to blur together into the same intelligent, mysterious, and polite personality; exceptions being few and far between. Most striking of all is our protagonist Jean, whose ability to show emotions range from mildly amused, to mildly not-so-amused. In a story centered on political intrigue, one would hope for at least one transparent character for the audience to latch onto, but instead we're left with few clues as to what anyone is truly thinking. To be fair, sometimes this minimalist approach to character interactions does work. The subtle nods between Jean and his best friend Nino are examples of how you can create a real connection with this kinda script. Personally I just wish there had been more of that.\\n\\n\r\nWhat elevates ACCA is its intrigue-driven plot and the world-building. As if watching old classic Soviet cinema, you get a sense that the true main character of the show is the country itself, rather than any single character. Many locations are explored, offering different political views and approaches to life, adding a multifaceted culture to it all. From that perspective, one could argue that the show did a gallant job in characterizing its setting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ACCA comes recommended to those who are looking for a more light-hearted experience, one where they can dissect a fictional universe at their own pace.",

            "content": "Decently build Fantasy world with political powerplay for the throne.\r\nStory (8)\r\nWhile the story moves very slowly, with slightly too much slice of live in the first third of the show, but still engaging. There isn't much action; if you are looking for gunfights, chase scenes or even stealthy action, this will dissapoint. It' dialolge driven. The- to me- best parts are the presentations of the different states, they not only help to expand the world and scale of the story, but also further and intensify the plot. The Royal Backstory we get was also quite enjoyable, interesting mostly due to the perspective it was toldfrom, but a bit predictable. that sadly goes for the rest of the show too. Interesting, but kind of predictable. If you're familiar with the genre, non of it is really surprising. Still well executed tho. \\n\\n\r\nNow, one big concern i still have, is weather this anime will go full facist or not. There have been very few indicators until now, exept for-you know- the ACTUAL SS UNIFORMS and the blond blue-eyed protagonist, + the choice of what appears to be the main villain. I really hope it wont go there, but with our MC having literally no opinion on anything, it's a bit hard to tell how well the show will fair in this regard. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\\n\r\nIntersting style , with a good colour pallete, which both helps to connect the fantasy elemts to the modern ones. Funny enaugh, kind of similiar to Ouran high school host clubs style. Thou not in a bad way. The faces also don't look the same on every character, even the girls. That's nice. Not so nice is how stiff the movements seem. I suspect that they have a pretty tight budget; non detailed animation looks pretty bad, and they move very stiffly, if they move at all. They try to keep them as still aas possible. There are however no huge noticable quality drops. The style is still very refreching, managing to be dark and serious despite it's warm , nearly neon colours.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors all do a pretty decent job, but the dialoge is often pretty slow with wierd pauses. Some Seem to also not fully mash with the characterdesign/ expression shown on screen. May seem like a nitpick, but i really couldn't get used to it , and i binged the 10 episodes currently out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4)\\n\\n\r\nThis shiw has many, though they are easy to categorize. Smart and serious persuing their goals (now in the flavours good and evil),  dumb and/or naive while friendly and/or harmless (tend to be annoying, but generally ok) and quiet but competend. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC is one off the last group, though he is sadly the worst among them; he is just quiet and competend. No emotions whatsoever. Lukewarm on everything. Never angry or happy. Looks and acts as if he was about to fall asleep any second. I guess he's supposed to be cool. To me he only seems bored. It gets better as the show progresses, but it's still really off putting, and makes it difficult to get into the story. How is one supposed to connect to character, if they don't have any emotions. \\n\\n\r\nAlso many of the charcters are sterotypical for their role in the story, which in turn makes the story predictable. If they would have given some of them a better introduction or more actual character, it would have been more suspensefull.\\n\\n\r\nPlus the german \"names\" are all exeptionally dumb. Nouns aren't names. But that's more of a nitpick.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5)\\n\\n\r\nNice to look at, but the slow dialoge and sometimes obvious plot twists, combined with disconnect from the MC make it quit hard to chew. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6)\\n\\n\r\nSlow with mediocre to boring charcters, but pretty neyt political worldbuilding. If that sounds good to you, it's worth a look. Still quite likely to turn into a   facist propaganda thing sooooo.......yeah. have fun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: If you want a mistery / political drama anime, stop reading reviews and go watch the episodes!\r\nACCA 13 is one of those animes wich I recommend if you're tired of the usual moe-school animes, as a \"political\" drama , the anime is quite interesting.\r\nWhy do I like ACCA:13? Everything they show you has a secret. No-one is what they appear to be, have you ever wondered about your family past?, all those 'what if...?'... no, those are all things that just children have time to think about, you have to keep it up with your job, living your life day past day, giving yourboss all those reports you were assigned, everything is normal until one day, everyone starts looking at you, talking in a quiet voice everytime they see you in their district. That's Jean for you. Just another worker in the organization who pleads for peace, with a quite expensive adicction, cigars. I find Jean the perfect reflection of the world they show us in ACCA:13, people who just mind the present, people who doesn't wonder about whats above simply because, they don't think thats their business, until they're dragged into something big.\\n\\n\r\nIn only 9 episodes they have woven a complicated web of deceptions and cover-ups, and when you think everything is starting to be more clean, they lead you to another mistery.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat did I find weak in this show? At first some of the plot twist start being \"obvious\" or \"stupid\" but after those; 'ACCA' started again.\\n\r\nApart from that, I had quite a problem with some of the characters since they seem to have quite an interesting background but are left behind to keep focusing on the main character, but this is -somewhat- fixed in the last episodes giving the series more flow.\\n\\n\r\nACCA 13 is not the typical action anime, it's first episodes are quite slow but, in my opinion, they do their work to start the machine and make us try to figure how *this* world works and how important some of the corporations or political figures matter to the coexistence of all the different districts.",

            "content": "ACCA is an anime in which nothing ever comes to fruition. Plot points are introduced and dissolved with no ripple effect whatsoever; all of the show's potential goes completely wasted on sandwich bread and cigarettes.\r\nCHARACTERS: 3/10\r\nWhile many of the characters are likeable, almost all of them are flat and uninteresting, including the protagonist, Jean.\r\nThe most interesting characters in the story are Jean's best friend Nino and one of the five chief officers of ACCA, Lilium. These are the two characters with the most thought put into their backstories and intentions.\r\nJean himself is the most boring character in the show. He doesn't seem to have anygoals or ambitions. He doesn't seem to have any drive or emotion. He's completely deadpan the entire time, at most cracking a smirk or raising an eyebrow. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\r\nDo not be fooled: this is not an anime filled with political intrigue like all of the descriptions say. This is an anime about baked goods and cigarettes and I can't explain that any further without veering into spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nThe first seven episodes each spend time setting up dominoes only to knock them down the very same episode and then never address them again. If you only watch the first three episodes of the series, I will tell you now that you will never again hear of the serial arson plotline even though it goes completely unresolved. The same happens for every single interesting plot point that gets put forward. You spend 18 minutes excited to see how things all come together, then in the last 3 minutes before the end credits, Jean stumbles through, everything falls apart, no consequences are felt, and nothing changes. This is the cycle until Episode 8, when things finally pick up.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twist at the end of Episode 7 is where things get really interesting, even if you picked up on all the hints and saw it coming. Unfortunately, Episodes 8-11 are the only episodes worth watching, as Episode 12 completely shirks all of the buildup from the previous episodes and tries to tie everything up in a neat little bow. It's rushed. It makes no sense. Nothing gets resolved. Almost nothing is different from the beginning of the series from the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is 6/10 exclusively because Episodes 8-11 are excellent. Episodes 1-7 and 12 are a boring slog that focuses too much of their time in bakeries and not enough time addressing any of the actual issues Jean is meant to be investigating. If I were to give a score based on those episodes alone, I would give this section a 1/10. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10:\\n\r\nACCA's soundtrack isn't bad. You get some funky beats here and there, which can be fun if you're listening for them; otherwise, the music seems to fade too far into the background to notice. The OP track is a blast, and the ED is very pretty. The voice acting in the series is good, but nothing particularly notable. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nThe only reason that I didn't score the art for ACCA a perfect 10 is because there are some clear corners that were cut in order to afford to make it as beautiful as it is. The show is almost like a painting come to life. The colours and linework are brilliant, and the lighting is always perfect. There are so many gorgeous shots littered throughout this anime, it's a wonder anyone manages to talk about anything else when it comes to this show. Annoyingly, most of the budget shows in the final episode, where every other shot shows characters without faces, even in close-up shots. \\n\\n\r\nIt pains me to score such a beautiful anime so low, but aesthetic is all ACCA brings to the table.",

I tried my best to write abit more, but writing this much is already enough for ACCA, a show that is the very definition of short and sweet.

            "content": "Ok, so after a long bout of watching anime with the usual plot, this one has given us something of what can be called a breath of fresh air, and frankly it's not always that we get to see something out from the ordinary, so let's get it on with:\r\nGood 7, Story\r\nWhat we have in here is plot that is full of twist and turns, at first you might be tempt to drop this out, but, the real surprise is that plan coup de etat, where you might ask yourself as to how the main character Jean Otus is connect with it, which would glueyou in to your seat in curiosity. Sure, it may take some time, but you'll get interested as the plot thickens because story itself was full of surprises. Still, I kinda hate that writer Tomohiro Suzuki can't seem to distinguish the difference between a coup de etat, and a revolution.\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, art\\n\\n\r\nThe illustration were ugly, but then again decent, so don't expect any panchira or any fanservices from , Lotta, Muave and other girls from this anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound\\n\\n\r\nI may not like both opening and closing themes, but then again, since the character's here weren't made to voiced youngsters with their grown up voices was good enough for me, regardless who voiced who. \\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Characters\\n\\n\r\nSo, we have were a bunch of characters who really did portrayed as grown-ups, instead of the usual kids who does a man's job, but what really makes it good was how the characters where used, like Jean Otus, a diligent inspector of ACCA, whom at first we wonder as how , he's connected to a planned mutiny against the spoiled brat prince who is the heir to the throne of Dowa, there is also Glossnar whom at first would make us think that he is Abend, the loyal body guard of Jean's Mom, let's not forget Nino, whom at first would make us think that he's the bad guy, but turns out to be Jean's secret body gurad, also Lotta , who is Jean's imoto, the good thing here is that there is non of the brocon, that we usually find in any anime, but it still has that reverse harem element in it were the potential character in her life would be Rail, Maggie and her cousin Prince Schwan. But , I still hate the possibility that Jean maybe gay and he probably loves Nino. Thought the antagonist here is Lilum, 1st princess and Prince Schwan, their portrayal were more on a subtle note that a rough one, in fact you would feel any disgust against them, unlike the usual antagonist portrayal, were one would hate them to the bone, so nice work, writer Shingo Natsume. \\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTBH, it was only as good to be enjoyed, cu'z, really, it's not that very good, the only reason why one would watch this was thickening of the plot , and that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Overall\\n\\n\r\nWell true to it's title, this anime did deliver, and it's not bad. But I kinda hate that the main character Jean Otus, has that suggestive thing and it's called SMOKING, which is BAD for your health and DON\"T EVEN THINK ABOUT PUFFING A CIGARETTE, PUTO!!!!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSurgeon General recommends that \"SMOKING IS BAD FOR YOU.\"  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The pace is slow at the start but it picks up and it was worth the wait until the ending. The last episode ruins it.\r\nThere are three twists in this show, the first one happens in episode 7, nobody who has seen episode 12 gives a shit about the second one, and thethird happens in episode 12 (the entirety of episode 12 is a twist).\\n\\n\r\nThe show maintained a pace from episode 1 - 11 and it was wonderful, the supporting characters came and went, the main cast was kept below the main character in terms of focus, the story takes the time it needs, and the art is fantastic. The art bleeds style.\\n\\n\r\nIf this show only had 11 episodes, I would give it an 8/10. After watching the 12th episode, I have dropped my rating to a 7/10. The ending was rushed, it has twists simply for the sake of having twists, it is littered with plot convenience, and the \"vibe\" that was created in 11 episodes was completely ruined.\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally say that the ending is everything, but ACCA was always working towards the end, the mystery and suspense, all wasted because apparently M. Night Shyamalan got his hands on the script.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind having a relatively bad ending, this is an 8/10 worthy show.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, 7/10 but still worth checking it out. ACCA is slow, beautiful, many of the characters don't get the screen time they need, and the ending is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nI still liked it though, check it out if you enjoy chill shows but be wary of the end.",

            "content": "ACCA 13... definitely a sleeper in a season that I personally felt disappointed by. There were hardly any anime that drew my attention at the time, but ACCA 13 drew me back every week. \r\nLike many have said before me, this anime is EXTREMELY plot driven. The story is quite heavy and immersive. The audience is thrust head first into this fictional world such a warm and approachable manner that it's hard to complain over the pace of the anime as the story progresses through the 12 episodes. \r\nAt it's core, I think the anime is looking for the audience to reflect on themselves. Thefact that there are 13 different districts that work in different ways, the idea of a royal family that exists as an entity outside of the established system, the plot by one family to attempt to overthrow the established system, it's all heavy stuff and calls into question what we think is the right way to live in our world. \\n\\n\r\nThere were quite a number of characters introduced to us over the season, however, we do get all the information we need from the main characters. We get to see the growth and backstory for a lot of the characters. The show makers really did find ways to weave in the backstory into the overall narrative in such a way that the characters are so connected to their place of origin that make them feel all the more real. \\n\\n\r\nAt it's best, ACCA 13 provides a fantasized version of our world and really helps us reflect on what it means to be from a certain place, what it means to live with your neighbors, and what it means to grow within a place. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music for the series was great all the way through. It felt very nostalgic and took me back to a different era of anime. The whole package felt very clever and I have to say that I felt so much smarter after each episode. The show plays out in such a way that you feel immersed and are also a part of the larger narrative.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a great watch and I really do wish more people catch onto it. It's an enjoyable show to watch and one that is easy to watch as well. It's light enough for those that only so often watch anime and true enough to the form to satisfy even the most veteran of anime watchers.",

            "content": "A political thriller that's long on glamor but short on substance.\r\nSTORY\r\nACCA-13 seems to have all the pieces of a good political thriller: a multitude of secretive factions, individuals with murky allegiances, back channel maneuvering, and high stakes. Except there's one critical problem, none of it adds up. They have all the game pieces but forgot to include the board. A good political thriller partly relies on the audience knowing how the political system works: 'House of Cards' depends on its audience having a basic understanding of how the US Congress operates, and 'Valkyrie' made sure to explain how the coup masterminds planned to kill Hitlerand assume control of the German government. ACCA-13's chief weakness as a story is that the political system is a vague mess, at some points implying the country is a loose confederation with a figurehead monarch and high levels of regional autonomy, and at others acting as if the royal family has enough authority to restructure the entire civilian bureaucracy with a word. The word 'coup' is thrown around a lot, but it's never really clear what would be overthrown or how. Cracks start appearing the second you take a serious look at it.\\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nArt is the high point of the series. The series has the glamorous 'Josei' look to it and some good backgrounds and character animation. It's easy on the eyes. Sound is also good with some solid voice acting from Funimation's experienced crew and a pretty decent OP. This series has some good production values, just not quite good enough to make something truly memorable out of fairly mediocre writing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe large cast suffers from problems spilling over from the story writing. With the political system unclear it isn't to tell which character is responsible for what, how much power they are supposed to have, and which ones we're supposed to be paying the closest attention to. The big character reveal of the series suffers from this same issue, without going into spoiler territory we learn the backstory of a major character which revolves around a political plot that makes no blooming sense. Now strictly as characters, the individual cast members do well enough even if they don't break any new ground. The series toys with the idea of 'maybe Jean Otus is a mastermind, maybe he really is just a clueless pawn' but never does anything spectacular with it. The cast is OK, but I wouldn't go beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nACCA-13 looks different and sounds different, it's obvious nobody would confuse it for this season's generic otaku power fantasy/harem schlock. But it doesn't have enough 'meat on its bones', so to speak. If you want a new aesthetic experience and are willing to not look too closely at the internal workings, ACCA-13 is enjoyable enough.",

            "content": "ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka or ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. was similar to a single dry, crusty saltine. It's boring and forgettable with only a little bit of substance to abate your hunger. \r\n\t\u2022 While, superficially, a stylized tango with political intrigue, ACCA falls short of any kind of tension or excitement that could be gained\u30fccontinuously killing moments with non-stop talk of food and delicatessens.\r\n\t\u2022 Initially, I had a lot of hope for ACCA. I like series that are political and I was drawn to the art style. I had only been aquatinted briefly with Natsume Ono's work before. I watched all of the anime for RistoranteParadiso, which was average but watchable, and the House of Leaves manga, which I had read four or five volumes of it AGES ago, I had no memory of what even happened in it except for vague details, if that tells you anything.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Despite not being a huge fan of her other works, I'm not one to completely blacklist a creator due to that fact. Well, not if you're Masakazu Yamaguchi's Arm of Kannon, localized as Birth, it\u2019s a different story. That's one of the worst things I've ever read in my entire life!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Seriously, fuck you, Tokyopop! Ahem, back to ACCA, the pacing is REALLY bad. Madhouse has been going downhill for a few years now, being steadily replaced by the superior Studio MAPPA; and this series has made me painfully aware that there probably isn't going to be another Kaiji, unless it\u2019s a sequel.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The character development is non-existent. It's pretty much occupied with a bunch of shallow, food-obsessed talking heads. Between the eating of bread and constant yammering, it implied that there may be a build-up, tension, or even what most stories need to function: a climax. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The ending is slightly refreshing and wraps up the points, but watching this is like watching a guy with a monotone voice give a lecture geography with small tidbits about the actual subject and the rest about how good a baguette would taste with melted butter. And for emphasis on how annoying the foodie crap was, I didn't want to eat bread while watching this show because it's constantly like, pan this, pan that, pan in my open butthole.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 My Japanese learning app even treats me with more respect on the subject of bread. The jazzy lounge music while characters babble to each other while doing mundane things is not my ideal show. I don't understand why there is such a following to this cardboard cut-out, let's-paste-a-story-together model. There is nothing inspiring or ambitious about this series; just a plain, null narrative. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Listening or watching things about current affairs and politics is far more enjoyable than watching this series that is pretty much just a splash of colors with some pseudo-deep \u201cintellectual\u201d social commentary. I would not recommend ACCA to ANYONE, unless they enjoy pretentious blathering and random food porn that contributes nothing to the plot. I give ACCA a 2/10.",

            "content": "ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka is a quirky political drama, which moves at a slow pace that may turn off the more action-oriented viewers. In the long-run, it's this same slow pacing that helps the show accomplish what it did. The setting is strange and it has a lot going on, so the calming atmosphere helps all of these details sink in gradually and easily. The dense, dialogue-heavy plot is also easier to digest with this measured method of storytelling.\r\nThe main protagonist, Jean Otus, is a likeable character right out of the gate. He is rather indifferent about most things and is content with his current life,including his tedious government job. Nontheless, he gets pulled into the coup d'etat scheme and he plays along with it, despite not really caring. Even with all of his neutrality and complacency, he somehow comes out the other end as a cool badass. He is quite confusing in this way: at times he seems like he knows more than he lets on, while other times you wonder if he's not just the most oblivious character in existence. Either way, he remains an endearing character who is easy to root for. \\n\\n\r\nJean's relationships with his younger sister Lotta and his best friend Nino are surprisingly real. There is an unspoken trust and loyalty between the three, with almost a \"no questions asked\" policy that they abide by without issue. This trust and friendship is portrayed in a very down-to-earth way, with very little cheesiness. They all act like the mature adults they are, which is refreshing after having watched so many anime about immature teenagers who don't know how to communicate. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the quiet feeling of the anime, it has a few plot twists here and there and the reveals are still able to pack a punch, maybe even moreso than they would have if ACCA had been a dramatic adrenaline rush. One reveal in particular is played out in such a nonchalant way that it took a few minutes to realize the gravity of what had just been said, and when it hit, it hit hard. ACCA is able to accomplish this because it has mastered the method of telling the viewers just enough to understand what's going on, while also keeping you just enough in the dark. This creates a sense of intrigue without too much confusion, and makes the plot twists very understandable in hindsight. \\n\\n\r\nThe calm, mysterious ambience is aided by the jazzy soundtrack, the fluid animation, and the attractive character designs. The aesthetic ties everything together, solidifying ACCA as a mature, thoughtful, and delicately executed anime, the kind that only seems to appear every once and a while. The one disappointing thing about ACCA is the lackluster ending. Without giving away too much, the conclusion essentially makes it feel as if nothing has happened, an unfortunate note on which to end a pleasant experience. Still, I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a good slow-burn drama.",

            "content": "ACCA is the thinking man's Natsume Yuujinchou. Both shows have a leisurely pace and EXTREMELY CALM main characters, along with a thoughtful tone and fairy tale-like mood. Both deal with the problem of companionship, and the complexity of identity. And neither is very flash-bang. I found ACCA to be a restful departure from the anime norm, and a great show to watch at the end of a hectic day.\r\nI do wish that ACCA would take the themes it presents to a deeper emotional level, and that it would have a greater sense of what is at stake. None of the characters emote very much, whichmay be a Japanese thing but certainly prevented me from feeling more connection with them. That said, the character design is good (done by the same guy who did House of Five Leaves) and the animation is lovely. It's an unusually illustrative style for an anime, but is very refreshing because of that, and they pull it off well. Several scenes are very artfully put together. The music too is different from the average, very simple arrangements, for the most part led by acoustic guitar.\\n\\n\r\nWhile ACCA presents itself as a kind of espionage thriller, it is intensely low-key, which while disappointing in some ways, is also very rewarding in others. It is an atypical show meant to be savored - the beautiful colors; the creative character designs; the playful motif of apple cake and toasting bread - and not devoured. Even if ACCA doesn't pass the three-episode test, it's a break from the routine that will cleanse your palate.",

The animation style is unique and a bit jarring at first, but you get used to it, and the style seems to fit well with the low key tones of the story and characters.\r\nThere are some fantastic characters in this and it is a shame that they aren't explored properly.  The last few episodes feel rushed and the ending fairly unsatisfying to me.  The show has a different feel than most anime and I really wish that it had stuck with the toneof the early episodes and kept the plot on the same simmer it had been going on.\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely worth a watch, but be prepared to get disappointed.",

            "content": "ACCA is the biggest surprise i've encountered this season. The only thing I knew about this show before watching it was the great OP and the amazing, slick-looking art and character designs. I could tell from the editing, style, and care put into the OP, as well as the song that it's paired with being so well-suited to the tone the sequence conveys that the show would be at least an 8/10 in my eyes, but I was THOROUGHLY impressed by this show, though i can't call it a masterpiece. I consider there to be a huge difference between the different numbers I rate showsby, so going up by an entire point is something I consider a significant feat.\\n\\n\r\nStory: rule number 1: this is not like what you're used to watching. 8/10, enjoyable, intelligent, and surprising, but doesn't do anything absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what is happening in this story, the tone will always be chill and casual. The only time it gets anywhere more intense than that is when everything is keikaku doori. I think call ing ACCA a slice of life would be extremely appropriate, as there are no extended scenes of characters yelling or any entry-level drama like that. Even if the situation were to become dire, the tone will always feel like it's trying to say \"dude, chill; It's just how life goes.\" The tone is also reflected in the structure of the story/ how it progresses through it's 12 episodes. Just like in life, things that you wouldn't ever expect will happen, and you'll be caught off guard because of how quietly things occur during the show. It is very subtle, and there are no plot holes or asspulls that I could see. It all made sense. But, this show isn't wrapped in symbolism at all. Any plot twists are simply due to how tight the writing is and how it's able to make you not question it initially, and still manage to make it seem like everything was actually being set up by someone in the first place upon looking back at the series after finishing it. everything related to pacing in this show is done on purpose and manages to work out, providing resolutions that only make sense because there was an extra 5 minutes spent in a few random districts.\\n\\n\r\nArt: slick, stylish, and appropriately laid-back. 9/10 because the animation didn't have very many highlights (even if this show's general tone justifies it) and the direction/cinematography wasn't revolutionary.\\n\\n\r\nEvery named character in the show has a unique, striking, and appropriate design. Even if you couldn't remember all the names, the designs were cool enough to at least let you recognize them when they reoccured throughout the story. Same with the districts, each has a distinct design and air to it and the people reflect the state of the district and it's culture. The animation is not bad at all, it's just that this is a very laid back series with almost no action at all, and so doesn't require very much sakuga. Even so, the few instances are very well integrated and helped add to certain characters, especially the relationship between Magie and Prince Schwan. The backgrounds were typically beautiful if my memory is accurate, and the OP was one of my favorites this season, being one of the few that I could actually gain meaning from and thus estimate the quality this show had. It shows the appeal of the show perfectly, demonstrating some the visually striking cast and kicking up some intrigue with some shots, while maintaining a beautiful, soft artstyle throughout more than half of the OP, along with some slick editing, until a brief flyby shot of some stills with most characters being almost completely pitch black, until a last shot that made me think that the ending would be something that didn't end up being the case so it also played with my expectations throughout the show. I wasn't able to get any significant meaning out of the ED, but it was very soothing to watch and listen to, as the animation is quite good, sort of reminding me of Mob Psycho's ED, but not as impressive of meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: conveyed the tone perfectly and was never out of place of straight up bad. That said, I can't remember any of the tracks, regardless of whether I believe it's worth downloading or not. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it was usually perfect in the show itself, as well as in the OP and ED. However, I only remember the OP's song. Even if I absolutely love it, that's not what I would consider an impressive soundtrack, though it was perfectly used. No standout tracks in the show itself, and the ED song was just not to my liking. You might like it, who knows?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: there are a few well established characters, but the others are not that special. Not bad, just not well developed. 9/10, regardless.\\n\\n\r\nI'll list the standouts right now; Jean, Mauve, Nino, Groshular, Lilium, Prince Schwan, Lotta, and Magie. That was in order, by the way. Jean is head and shoulders above the rest though. The thing with most of these characters is that they're already adults. The only development they can have beyond who they've turned out as is in their backstory or how they interact with others. The one character with the most development is Schwan, though. It's just that he only has that, and no backstory or interesting actions in the story. He is more intelligent than he's initially portrayed to be by other characters, but he gets outdone in every situation because he's incompetent. It's no surprise, everybody knows it. Now, let's talk Jean Otus. He is the perfect protagonist for this story, and is built up early on to be intelligent and well-liked, despite his somewhat disconnected nature. He is put in some extreme situations and has several major revelations made to him, but he simply shrugs it off. Not because he doesn't care per se, it's just that he dislikes rushing things, and has the composure to think about things calmly and have some insight regarding people and situations with minor evidence, which makes his reaction to the one thing he would forever be oblivious of that much more... Heartwarming, almost. I feel like I've skipped a lot regarding his character, but it might be for the best. The other characters, specifically the ones in the districts that Jean visits are somewhat one dimensional, but seem to have history with Jean, which is very interesting because either they or Jean remarks how they've changed since they've moved to their new assigned district. This enhances the character and allows some insight into the district itself. IT'S MULTILAYERED OH MAI GAD. This is shown quite subtly in one of the last episodes when a character named Eider comes back to the Inspection Department HQ, when some of the female agents ask her about her relationship status. Here's the thing, only one of them is not from HQ. There were other female characters from other districts present, but they didn't take part in the conversation as their personalities weren't fit for office gossip. It really made me feel like even there minor characters were, in fact, people with their own history and lives. There was also another scene among most of the guys right after that one that was chill as hell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: this almost immediately made me kick off another show fro my favorites and put this there. Yeah, it's a 10 in enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: not like most other things. 9/10 due to the surprise factor i got from it.\\n\\n\r\nI've not much more to say. Watch it if you want something fresh, but not heavy. Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu is also fresh, but has a much heavier, emotional tone, regardless of whether it's better or not. ACCA looks great and is just a fun, lighthearted ride, that isn't too slow or distractingly fast, but is still methodical, subtle, smart and surprising.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions on how to make my reviews better or just want to have a talk about anime or whatever, message me or invite me or however people communicate with each other on this website. Thanks for reading, and check out my other reviews if your like this one (I feel like a Youtuber). Have a nice day.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sci-fi/fantasy is my favorite genre of anime (and my favorite genre for any media pretty much). But something any fantasy fan can tell you is that there\u2019s no shortage of generic fantasy media out there. In fact, there\u2019s heaps and heaps of it. But what keeps my love for the genre alive is the occasional unique gem of a world, and that\u2019s exactly what ACCA delivers. Well thought out, nice to look at, fun and full of variety \u2013 that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the world of ACCA.\r\nNow, this show isn\u2019t for everyone. I think a lot of people find it a bit boring, but itis a political intrigue drama about a government agency after all. You have to know what you\u2019re getting into. The show takes its time setting everything up, and I\u2019ve heard complaints about the pacing. However, I have none. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this show, never once feeling like it was wasting my time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen not setting up crucial plot points early on, ACCA spends its time showing us the wonderful world it inhabits. Thanks to Jean\u2019s job, we get to travel to each of the thirteen districts and explore them along with him, getting a brief but fulfilling taste of each place.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve also heard complaints about the characters, but again \u2013 I have none. From Jean to Nino to Mauve to Lilium, it\u2019s a fun cast that really helps to smooth the way through what might indeed have been a dull show without them. Jean\u2019s deadpan voice and attitude might be a problem for some, but I actually found myself loving it. To me, he\u2019s the perfect character for the narrative position he\u2019s put in. And hopefully this isn\u2019t considered a spoiler, but I found myself rooting for one of the show\u2019s \u201cvillains\u201d just because he\u2019s so damn compelling.\\n\\n\r\nBesides all of this, the show just looks good. The character designs are wonderful, the backgrounds are solid, and each district is a delight to be exposed to. Combine that with a catchy OP, and you\u2019ve got one of the more stylish shows of the season.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t consider this a \u2018show for intellectuals\u2019 or any of that, just because it starts slow and concerns politics. I think it\u2019s a show anyone can enjoy. If I had to name a flaw, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the end. I thought they wrapped everything up in a way that was a little too perfect to be believable. I\u2019m rarely completely satisfied by an ending, though, so I may just be being picky here.\\n\\n\r\nBoasting one of the more unique fantasy worlds I\u2019ve seen in a while, and some interesting characters to populate and utilize that world, this show is definitely worth the time it takes to lay out its groundwork.",

Jean (the MC) is quite interesting, he is very passive, very calm and introspective and he works as an inspector for ACCA, in a kingdom (yes there\u2019s a 99 year old monarch). The story is not that special, but it keeps you guessing. \r\nYou\u2019ll have to be an active viewer to enjoy ACCA 13 \u2013 forget multitasking! It\u2019s not advisable to lose all the little details, because they are quite enjoyable and important to understand the story as well. Oh,and in ACCA 13, the 13 districts have different levels of progress and there\u2019s bread\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI wish I had seen more character development\u2026 But the art is fine, the animation is very cinematic or photographic \u2013 Madhouse did a good job.

            "content": "ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka (ACCA: 13th Territory Inspection Department)\r\n\"The story revolves around the second-in-command of the inspection department performing his audits on 13 states of the country.\" --This one liner fails to entice a huge number of its viewers to a certain extent. As the description implies, the plot is not your usual \"power of friendship\" fiasco: it involves investigation and deducing conspiracy theories. At most, it filters a lot of its audience during the first few episodes.  However, once you have been invested in the series, provided that you are observant, you can enjoy following the flow of the story. I found the storyto be complex and difficult to predict. Despite that fact, it was quite enjoyable because it stuck with its original point from start to finish. (With a lil' bit of side-trips along the way.) Also, don't forget about the plot twists. Again and again I have been baffled at how many times this series could make my predictions go wrong. What contributes to this predicament is that there were times that it relayed very predictable actions/character reveals, but all throughout the series there were also misleading elements.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a bit unique, although there may be design-and-archetype combination that might be faintly familiar for some. Along with the creative writing, there are several points in this series that showcased the appeal and personalities of most characters. Most of the supporting cast had their distinctive sense of personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, it's safe to say that the art style was not too shabby. My only complain is that there seemed to be quality drops starting from the middle of the series.  It became quite terrible at some point, having poor animation and low quality.  Either way, if you're not to particular when it comes to this aspect, there really isn't much to mention. No picture-perfect scenes, but there are some pretty neat illustrations that, most likely, are based on popular and/or historical places in the real world. (Also: Less eye-candy.)\\n\\n\r\nSound quality: It has good voice-acting. There was nothing intense with the background music nor sound effects, but I cannot say that it was lacking. Aside from the fun and serene combination of opening and endings, there would be nothing else that is noteworthy in particular, in my honest opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[TL;DR]\\n\r\nStory : 8 (40% = 3.2)\\n\r\nCharacter : 9 (25% = 2.25)\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5 (20% = 1)\\n\r\nSound : 8 (15%= 1.2)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7.65 ~> 8/10\\n\r\n(Enjoyment : 6, Not Included in Criteria Rating)\\n\r\nNot suitable and/or enjoyable for all audiences. Enjoyable for those who love political & power struggle/detective type of shows.\\n\r\nAlso, again, plot twists.",

            "content": "When Acca came out it caused three types of reactions: \r\n-Those who lost their shit because it was made by the same author that wrote House of Five Leaves. \r\n-Those that lost their shit because it seemed similar to Joker Game.\r\n-Those that didn\u2019t watch any of those shows and thus didn\u2019t care about it at all. \r\nAnd I am one of those that didn\u2019t watch it when it came out. So, I decided to check it out now and found it astronomically boring.\r\nSo, there\u2019s a kingdom composed of thirteen states and a public service organization that maintains peace amongst all of them. Jean, the protagonist,is an inspector of said organization and is doing inspections in every state while rumors of a coup d'\u00e9tat have spreaded throughout the kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nStarting with the strongest aspect of the show, the sound department; the sound effects are passable but the soundtrack is very good, sometimes calm, sometimes upbeat, but always classy. I\u2019m not much of a fan of its opening and ending, but both were good, the former got a song with an original and interesting mix of different music genres and also great visuals, while the latter was simply beautiful. There is a second ending that was ok too. As for the voice acting, I think some of the choices in the casting weren\u2019t accurate (Pastice), but everyone did a good job. \\n\\n\r\nFollowing with the visual department, it looks weird mostly due to the color palette, it has some quality drops and since it\u2019s not a series where the movement is important, that element is rather weak. Other than that, is a solid work mostly for the backgrounds and the character designs, which although having a generic look of a josei manga, they still manage to look different than most other series, again, mostly for the color palette. Although they have weird hair colors, most of the characters look as serious adults, with the obvious exception being the fat version of Tintin, seriously what\u2019s up with that guy? Also, since every district that is part of the kingdom is evidently based on a real country, there\u2019s a lot of variety amongst them in shapes, traits, skin, clothes and stuff. It fits the setting nicely, which, as I said, it is based on real countries from Europe, Asia and to a lesser extent, Africa; so there\u2019s also a lot of variety in the series when it comes to backgrounds, and everything looks beautifully drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about the setting, this is when the negatives start since it doesn\u2019t make much sense, although the depiction of the countries the states were based on were mostly accurate, the whole setting looks like it\u2019s based on the post-war era and yet there are satellite antennas and even modern day technologies such as cell phones and notebooks.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot feels slow, mostly due to the tone of the first episodes; where the protagonist, Jean, go to every state, sees the situation on everyone of them, takes little action on some small conflicts that happens there with a totally disinterested attitude, eats sweets and breads, buy some more sweets and breads for his sister (mostly sweets) and drinks lots of beer with his best friend; but midway on the series the story tries to convince the viewer that he was actually plotting the coup d'\u00e9tat all along. HOW? He was clueless about it until the Director of the organization told him. Also these first episodes have some silly moments like every scene with Lotta, the mc\u2019s sister; and the prince, because, well, he is stupid, no, seriously, even the other characters point it out until the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nThings get more interesting and serious on the middle episodes and onwards, there were still some comical moments, but from that point the series feels more focused on its plot and drama. The coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was moving forward, slowly and completely by talking about it, but moving forward regardless; and there were some really touching moments regarding Jean and Jino\u2019s past, where the show starts to  present its characters as people instead of spies puppets. But when the series was going well, the finale came and it was a complete ass-pull. Turns out Jean had a master plan within his master plan all along; and what a plausible one, stop everything with two people, yeah, right; also, there was no foreshadowing about it, it was complete bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nJean is easily the most boring and uninteresting character in the whole show, although he has a great past, he doesn\u2019t react to anything that is going on in an interesting way, not even the revelation of his real identity; I\u2019m not saying that the series should have showed that in an overdramatic way but we got\u2026almost nothing. Also he is labeled as some super genius by everyone else when he is otherwise clueless, disinterested and distant on the first episodes; but I will admit that he got slightly better on the middle when he starts having internal thoughts about how to proceed on the whole thing\u2026until his stupid hidden master plan within a master plan ruined everything. Well, at least he is slightly better than most of the teenagers with first world problems modern anime is so full of; and most of Urobuchi\u2019s passive mouthpieces. There was only a moment when Jean seemed a human, and that was only because he got turned on by Mauve.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about her, why wasn\u2019t she the main character? Apart from being the definitive waifu from 2017 (with Angie Varley from Mahoutsukai no Yome being a close second), she is also constantly thinking and investigating about what\u2019s going on, while also having strong ideals, she is the whole opposite of Jean, give her a past and make her the main protagonist, and this show is automatically better.\\n\\n\r\nJino was another decent character, although he is shown as only a typical cool mysterious protagonist\u2019s best friend in the beginning, the revelation of his past, and his work as a double agent, as well as his actual thoughts and feelings about the whole situation, and being shown as someone with actual own will, made him a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s as far as the good goes with the characters; the others aren\u2019t bad, but nothing more than passable, the antagonists are not psychotics PURE EVIL ones like lots of anime today like to portray theirs, but nonetheless; they still remained as typical mysterious master minds behind the whole thing with little to none information about them, and the secondary characters didn\u2019t really matter, Lotta and the female subordinates of Jean were particularly annoying, what does sweets, breads, and girls talks have to do with a military setting where a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is taking place? They are useless and unnecessary but on the other hand at least they felt like people. Wobular could have been a good character if he had more presence, something that didn\u2019t happen, but he was still ok; the exact same thing can be said about Oulu. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Acca wasn\u2019t a bad series; it does have problems regarding its pacing, setting and closure, but the plot wasn\u2019t awful thanks to its mid episodes, the cast was decent because it didn\u2019t have teenagers with first world problems, moeblobs or psychotics villains, the production was good and the setting was realistic up to some point, and it didn\u2019t ruined said realistic setting completely with a psychotic edgelord loli that blows up shit with magic like Youjo Senki did.",

I really don't like to rate stuff in numbers\r\nAnyhow.\r\nStory:\r\nWhile you think that the story progresses quite slow it's actually testing viewers abilities to find what could be the main plot of the whole story. Before you even notice ,the main point is  thrown stright into your face and you kinda feel dumb for not notiicing it (opening, and other small details).\r\nArt:\r\nWhile the style now isquite rare newdays , it has good feeling about it. Like a fresh breath of country air. You come to like it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\r\nThe sounds compliment the whole plot but not overshadow it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI am amazed by how smart the author has made them. All their plot twisted characteristics and stuff. Not to mention relief characters that really complimented the main ones( Lotte, Magie etc.).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nGod. It was awesome. Maybe ,since I couldn't notice the main point only when it was thrown at me. I went into happy overdose. I COULDN'T predict many upcoming things and that was like fantastic and mind opening about how predictatable/clich\u0113 some other stories have become.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf I had a bit more time I would definitely watch all episode in one day.\\n\r\nI think that I kind of forgot some stuff overnight, but the main point was remembered.\\n\\n\r\nThis might have been long review but in order to review it best it was necessary.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\n For those who still read this review- thanks and good job.

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 A not entirely un-enjoyable series, though one where much of what's funny seems unintentional, or at least it's hard to tell when other anime take the same things so seriously. How this one seems to be taken so seriously by some people, though, I cannot fathom.\r\nOn an island that looks like Japan if re-imagined by a second rate marketing agency, the peaceful kingdom of Dowa unknowingly stands on the brink of chaos. A royal succession crisis - with the only legitimate male heir to the aging emperor being a vein, prideful wastrel \u2013 is being exacerbated by persistent rumours that the kingdom's memberstates are plotting a coup. All that seems to stand in between peace & war is Jean Otus, deputy chief investigator of ACCA; the military/bureaucratic organisation that is responsible for running the kingdom.\\n\\n\r\nSporting a uniform straight out of a 1940s Hugo Boss catalogue, Otus' seemingly routine task of auditing the thirteen regional ACCA branches soon sees him caught up in a conspiracy that leads right to the top & involving him in ways he couldn't imagine. Everything looks set for ACCA to be a riveting conspiracy thriller, even with the slow, methodical pacing it begins with.\\n\\n\r\nSo why can it seem so boring?\\n\\n\r\nIf production issues were the only problem, it wouldn't matter so much. While no car crash, ACCA is one of the lowest effort Madhouse productions I've seen in some time. Not unpleasant to watch, none the less everything looks & moves stiffly & awkwardly, while backgrounds are static at best & at times are so basic they could almost pass as a Rothko painting. It gets worse as the series progresses, to the point where they simply stop giving unimportant or middle-distance characters eyes in a number of cuts.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile the OST, while one wouldn't call any of it as bad, can often charitably be described as elevator music, particularly at more light hearted moments. In short, it's a fairly low effort production that appears to add nothing to the source material beyond colour. This isn't such a big issue, given the slow pace & dialogue driven nature of the ACCA. But it does mean that if the story fails to hold you, the production won't either.\\n\\n\r\nWhich wouldn't be as much of an issue if the story or characters could carry themselves. Jean is admittedly a pretty decent protagonist, at least at first when he's more of a means to take the audience to different locations rather than the focus of events. However, he's a pretty clich\u00e9-cool character, not one to mince words & smoking like a chimney \u2013 an image so old hat that Cowboy Bebop made a running joke out of it twenty years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast, however, rarely contribute much beyond their increasingly limited roles in the shows ever expanding ensemble. Jean's friend Nino for instance, despite his cool hacker dude look, is pretty much just there so once an episode he can appear to say \u201cI'm totally not following you\u201d & then later \u201csomeone else is totally following you.\u201d His sister Lotta is, despite the mangaka being a woman, best summed up as a middle aged man's image of an ideal young woman \u2013 pretty, polite, loves anything sweet & is so na\u00efve that when assassins are trying to break in, her biggest concern is that they might damage the windows. I'd like to think it's meant as a joke, but you can never tell with anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe conspiracy that drives ACCA's plot could have been the shows saving grace, if they hadn't introduced it in the first episode. While not the focus of the first half, the writers none the less felt the need to spend a portion of each episode on the machinations going on behind the scenes, which becomes increasingly confused & convoluted as new twists & turns keep being added. It's only not more of an issue because the ending renders much of it irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nACCA's world also starts losing its appeal pretty quickly. While more varied & globally minded than is typical for today's anime, it also quickly takes the form of a rather strangely laid out version of It's a Small World that doesn't really work as an actual nation. I'm not sure which \u201cdistrict\u201d was my favourite, the Les Miserables world or the Viva Las Vegas one. It ultimately comes across as though the creators like the idea of an outside world, but have never visited it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also clearly an attempt at social commentary going on, with a lot of attention being drawn to social & regional disparities. However, it goes about it in some odd ways; for instance with Jean's chain-smoking being made out to be a bourgeoisie luxury until he says \u201cnuh-uh I'm actually totes poor\u201d & everyone just goes with it. It seems doubly odd, given who it turns out Jean is, but it's there now so people can say \u201comg this show has so much to say about the world.\u201d Or maybe it's also meant to be funny.\\n\\n\r\nMore negative - & this paragraph spoils parts of the ending so be warned \u2013 is that, while ACCA contains some of the whitest Native-Americans outside of a John Ford film, the Kingdom of Dowa has every shade of hair & eye colour represented, but next to no people of colour. Indeed, when it becomes clear (as if it wasn't obvious from the start) what role in the conspiracy the sole brown skinned people play, it starts to feel a tad racist. This isn't helped by how Jean is a jackbooted Aryan & the conspiracy is 'successfully' halted by ACCA becoming a de-facto military dictatorship (a Shogunate, if you will) while the brown people \u2013 scheming Arabs who control the oil supply, naturally \u2013 are kicked out the kingdom. The new dictator is a woman, though, so at least you could call it a progressive dictatorship.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this could be laughed off as a joke if it didn't fit in with an oddly right-wing, revisionist trend seen in recent anime like Kancolle, GATE & Joker Game. Speaking of JG, it's hard not to see that show's outsized success & loyal fanbase as at least somewhat responsible for ACCA being in the state that it is. A sloppy series that really could have used more production time & resources, it's easy to think that the production committee, dominated by merchandising companies, were pushing to get it released in time to cash in, apparently with some success. \\n\\n\r\nI guess ladies love jackbooted gentlemen.",

            "content": "Cake and cigarettes, your doctor will love this combination.\r\nStory:\r\nThe federal kingdom of Dowa has 13 very independent states, that are rumored to plan a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat for unknown reasons. ACCA, the organization that is trying to hold everything together is in an existential crisis and Jean Otus, member of the department for internal affairs is somehow playing a vital part in all of this, though he has no idea why that is. For the most part, we accompany Jean on his travels throughout the member states, which are all extremely different in culture, infrastructure and climatic conditions. We have one district that is de factoLas Vegas, another one looks like 19th century Europe and yet another looks like a South American settlement. If anything, ACCA 13 is very creative in building its world, obsessing over details and being quite imaginative in general. However, this is also the biggest weakness this show has: It is very slow paced. I mean, the plot doesn\u2019t really start to develop untill two thirds of the episodes are already over. It somewhat fits this anime, as it is devoid of action for the most part and focuses on politics mainly. Still, it feels like too much time was wasted on the way. I think ACCA could have benefited from being a 2-cours series. Just go into even more detail and let the climax build up earlier and we would have had a fantastic thriller. As it stands, we have a show that is good, but one that really tests your patience.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe character design is a refreshing diversion from the roundish style employed by most anime, yet it isn\u2019t as angular as serious works often look. It also appears that everybody (except Lotta) has a smug smile as their default facial expression. Due to the nature of the show (being mostly talking) there isn\u2019t that much to animate, but the little there is looked fine to me. The backgrounds were nicely done and despite portraying a realistic scenery, ACCA was quite colorful, which is great, since real life is usually portrayed as very plain in fictional works, which is totally not true. For both opening and ending, the animators were allowed to run wild, both looking really good in their respective styles.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSpeaking of opening and ending, they didn\u2019t only look really good, they are also both pretty good songs. The opening sounds kinda like that one Paula Abdul song, only better. The rest of the soundtrack didn\u2019t really remain in my head, which in doubt is always a plus. The voice acting was solid. Kenjirou Tsuda is slowly starting to get on my radar, he has a very distinctive voice, though it will be interesting to see what he can do in roles that require him to vary it. Aoi Yuuki got a more soft-spoken role again, which I prefer over her bratty ones.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYes, ACCA 13 had characters. Lots of them. Let\u2019s only focus on the more important ones here. The main character Jean is a very laid-back guy who seems to always keep his cool, no matter what (except that one time with Mauve at the restaurant). At first he doesn\u2019t really understand what is going on, but he is not an idiot and figures out quite a lot after a while. It was kind of refreshing to have a main character being neither hot-blooded nor stupid nor emotionless, but a normal, intelligent guy. His buddy Nino is an interesting x-factor to the whole story. You can never be 100% sure where exactly his loyalty lies, but neither he nor Jean make a fuss about it. In general, most characters are very accepting of the circumstances, which was unusual but not uninteresting. Out of the ACCA staff, we have Mauve, the\u2026eh, General-Director I think? Basically, she is the boss of ACCA, but she still has to report to the five guy-council. She has a strong, aggressive personality (as far as this goes in this anime) and can appear very strict. She also has no qualms to disregard advices from above if she thinks it\u2019ll benefit the case. Still, she is not an unfriendly or brash person, which makes her pretty cool in my book. The council itself isn\u2019t put much focus on in terms of members, only Groshular and Lilium stick out a bit. Even though one of them is involved in the finale, it still didn\u2019t feel like they did much with him. That is a general problem of this show, because of the sheer amount of characters, most don\u2019t get much development.\\n\r\nOutside of ACCA we have the prince, who is an arrogant manchild and the cause for the coup plans, since nobody wants him to ascend to the throne. Finally, we have Jeans little sister Lotta. She doesn\u2019t move the story forward in any way, but she\u2019s a happy little cutie and I\u2019m a sucker for that.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nACCA 13 has one major problem that may affect your personal enjoyment and that is the pacing. I don\u2019t mind that it takes it\u2019s time to build up, but twelve episodes are not enough to flesh out the cast and shine a light on all the background and history in a satisfying amount. What they do is all fine and dandy and the whole plot gets more and more interesting, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this show did not utilize its full potential. However, I never really had the feeling that this anime is getting nowhere or that the characters were bland or boring. If you don\u2019t mind the almost complete lack of action and are interested in the politics of a fictional country, this may be something for you. I\u2019d say, the lower your patience, the less fun you will have with this.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.4/10",

            "content": "This anime is decent, but unfortunately a very major flaw keeps it from living up to the potential I thought it had (will get to that part at the end). ACCA has a unique vibe in how chill and relaxed it is, yet it's suspenseful with genuinely surprising plot twists. \r\nThe setting is an island country which is like a little sampler of the real world. The country is a federation of 13 different districts managed by a government agency called the ACCA.  Each district has distinct environmental, social, and economic conditions inspired by places and historical events in the real world.\r\nBasically you havethe main protagonist, Jean, an inspector in the ACCA who finds himself in the crossfires between other ACCA bureaucrats and the disliked heir to the throne. The plot follows Jean as he finds himself having to investigate rumors circulating around the country of a future coup attempt against the prince slated to become king. It does a nice job of portraying political conflict by keeping you guessing about different characters' true motives and loyalties. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, ACCA is like a politically-themed mystery. The plot buildup is cleverly set up at the cost of things feeling down-tempo at times. If you want an intelligent anime but don't mind the slow part, you'll probably appreciate ACCA. On top of that it has very good, vibrant art. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I give ACCA a 7 and not an 8 or 9 is because it is a textbook example of a good anime with a bad ending. I won't get into too much details to avoid spoilers, but I will say this anime's ending (ie. the resolution of conflict) was pretty lazy and contrived. I finished ACCA feeling pretty let down considering how much I had been enjoying it up until the end. But hey though, apparently a lot of people liked the ending, so regardless it won't hurt to give the show a shot. \\n\\n\r\nGood anime, but could've easily been better. 7/10.",

            "content": "Overall: 9\r\nACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka is a show with incredible aesthetics that is presented with very little tension, but is nonetheless is an absolute joy to watch. Everything in this show feeds into its chill atmosphere, such that the entire presentation is very cohesive and pleasing.\r\nStory & Character: 8\r\nThe world of ACCA is interesting: in a kingdom called D\u014dwa, there are 13 districts, united by their celebration of each district's unique traditions. While there is a king, an organization called ACCA is in charge of running the nation. Of course, there is dissent; our protagonist, Jean Otus, is said to be a key figure in acoup.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime that deal with politics, ACCA's world is populated by adults, and the characters all behave maturely (meaning there are no hot-blooded disputes). The show itself also does not hyper-dramaticize the events of the story, which is both a good and a bad point: the good is that the ACCA organization itself is life-like in its efficiency and, well, office politics, and the bad is that the show itself lacks tension on its surface. The plot holds itself together very well, and yet at the same time there isn't much drama to compel the viewer to keep watching the show. That does't mean ACCA is boring; rather, it is excellent but not absolutely riveting.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nTHE ART OF THIS SHOW IS AMAZING. The colours work in harmony and the scenery, which is exquisitely detailed, exudes softness. The art of ACCA complements the cool tone of this series, and there is no better way to possibly make this show. The character design is different from the usual anime, forgoing the usual clinically thin lines and sparkly googly eyes for bold linework and simple features, and this sort of dressing down enhances the tone of simplicity in this show. Honestly, the aesthetics is simply incredible.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacters are aptly voiced. Background music is playful or sinister at times, but never over the top. I love the opening theme of the show, but the ending theme doesn't do much for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI absolutely loved this show. Nonetheless, though I recognize the importance of keeping the tone of the show cool, its lack of tension made it a tad less than perfect.",

No spoilers.\r\nI am so glad I gave this little show a chance! \r\nI love the characters & got the impression that nothing was left to luck and chance, that everything the characters are and everything they embody is intentional = heavily pre-planned.\r\nThe protagonist is loveable. (And cute...)\r\nThe (many) characters we get to know, all of them come with a unique personality and by that I mean, every character on the show would make a great first protagonist. \r\nThe first episode wasn't much. However, before the 2nd episode was over I had found myself entertained and engaged, morethan I had expected... I really had a great 3 months. \\n\r\nThe story is well-drafted, the result being a detailed picture and an intriguing story that opens up slowly but steadily; it demands to be watched. \\n\\n\r\nI had such an amazing time with ACCA, I am actually sad it's over.\\n\r\nIt is really, really, really sad but it has gotten me (back) into the realm of intrigue, mystery, fun&chill time, and anticipation... \\n\r\nI want Madhouse to give me more. And I want more of that genre!\\n\r\nGood that The Americans (TV) are back with a new season. I can't wait for GoT and House of Cards, I want them to give me my shows right now... gotta hold my breath and hope for the best. \\n\\n\r\nI am not sure if that's it for ACCA, if that's it for the franchise. \\n\r\nThere's a lot of potential for fast/slow-pace side-stories. I wouldn't hold my breath though. \\n\r\nI hope we will get an OVA... something! \\n\r\nIs the story complete? IMO, definitely, yes!\\n\r\nIs the ending satisfying?  Yes, but underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a 9 out of 10, for what it is.\\n\r\nI'm giving it a 10, BECAUSE.\\n",

            "content": "This is a 9/10 for me. It's definitely a must watch.\r\n1st, let's talk about the upsides. I gotta say how i adore the art, the music and overall, the atmosphere that these 2 factors create altogether. You gonna have to watch the anime to understand, but those who watched it should. The characters are original and well designed. And the story is some of the best i've ever seen for quite awhile, given the context of a 12-episodes anime.\r\nHowever there are some downsides: There's one big gap of story in the episodes between episode 8 and episode 12, which is kinda unwell planned. The tempoof the anime was pushed up really high around episode 9 and suddenly got dramatically dropped almost to an idle level, with even less activities than the first few episodes. If you've learnt about presentation's 101s for awhile, you'd know that it is very ill-advised to leave the tempo comparatively low for a really long time (almost 2 episodes and a half). Some of you may have experienced that kind of the moment when you talked for too long with too much information on a certain points and the audiences start to look around and lose their focus/interest. That exact thing happened in the last few episodes of this anime: The tempo was killed brutally right after episode 9 and the events which were meant to bring back the tension were actually not every well exploited (They happened too quick and not dramatic enough. The response of characters to those events were also lukewarm). Thus, much less tension was felt in the final episode than there were supposed to be, and the ending, as good as it is, couldn't generate the full enjoyment burst that we expected.\\n\\n\r\nI'd conclude this with another comment regarding the characters. Most of the characters are portrayed at the perfect depth, especially Nino. However, i still hoped that they have prioritize a bit more on the \"Cigar Pededer\" side - that perceptive, decisive and enigmatic side of Jean. It felt like that identity felt short quite a bit at the second half of the anime where Jean was almost led by the nose by multiple different characters. It's not like Jean's personality is not being logically portrayed, I gotta say l love that honest side of Jean and we love him for that character, but there's not enough spotlight for that Yami Yugi side at the 2nd half. It almost killed that identity and at the end of the day I felt Jean's a little bit inconsistent. These factors contributed to the limited enjoyment that the ending created.",

            "content": "7.5/10\r\n\"ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka\" had been on my planned to watch list for quite a while. I remember being really interested to watch it after reading the synopsis but didn't dive in immediately when I saw that this anime has only 12 episodes. With the expansive world already suggested by the synopsis, I was hesitant as to whether they would be able to explore enough of each of the 13 states; surprisingly, they were able to execute it very well for a 12 episodes series. I was really intrigued by the diversity and unique characteristics of the structures, citizens, and lifestyles from each district.\r\nIn terms ofeach episode's pacing, I agree to both sides and think that the \"slow\" pacing is both efficient and deficient to the enjoyment of the show. The first few episodes the show focuses more on building and introducing the different states that forms the kingdom of Dowa. So compared to the later episodes, the first few episodes are considered to be more slow paced, however, I believe the content provided was essential to make the audience have a better understanding of the circumstances of the different states as well for the overall of the kingdom's. Without this preparation, the plot twists hidden in this show (which surprisingly has quite a lot) wouldn't have as much of a big impact to the audience. Additionally, I liked how there were scenes that was more \"slice of life\" and that every second of the show didn't have to always be about the main plot of coup d'\u00e9tat; I feel like I'm able to watch and consider this anime as \"relaxing\" despite the complex story line it has. \\n\r\nI'm thankful that I've discovered this show after it has finished airing because honestly, had I discovered it since the beginning and had to wait week by week to watch an episode, I may have dropped it since the beginning as I tend to prefer more fast paced animes of the same genre. If you're reading this and haven't watched ACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka yet, I really suggest you try watching it; I feel like I shouldn't say anything more or else I'll be spoiling the excitement ahaha",

Thankfully for me, I\u2019ve never smoked a day in my life.\r\nThe horrible side effects. The frightening commercials. The wisdom from my parents. Many an influence has made the decision to avoid cigarettes an easy one, indeed. It\u2019s not an incredible feat by any standard, but I\u2019m glad that I did not start something that would only negatively impact my health.\r\nWhile ACCA itself does not (and literally cannot) smoke, its mistakes hurt it enough that it doesn\u2019t need to inhale nasty chemicals to reach the same unhealthy state.\r\nSTORY\r\nACCA centerson an unassuming man by the name of Jean Otus. As Deputy Chief of the Territory Inspection Department within ACCA, the esteemed organization that protects the people through governmental rule, Jean finds himself tasked with visiting each of the nation\u2019s thirteen districts. But, little does he know, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat broils \u2013 and he\u2019s at the center of it all.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the anime sets itself up as a mystery drama with all the makings of an intriguing tale at its disposal. The encroaching coup foreshadows the endgame. Jean\u2019s semi-unreliable-narrator status forces the audience to keep everyone under scrutiny. A handful of different perspectives, from the royalty of Dowa to the Five Chief Generals of ACCA itself, keep the puzzle pieces in reach but slightly out of position.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all there \u2013 but ACCA cannot complete the picture.\\n\\n\r\nOne of ACCA\u2019s bigger blunders comes from an inability to land firmly on its more dramatic reveals. Despite the show\u2019s penchant for mystery, when it comes time to unveil certain information, the landing doesn\u2019t stick either because the show fails at qualifying this info or because it isn\u2019t as weighty as the anime would have the audience believe.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Nino reveals himself to Jean once Jean knows that Nino has been spying on him. Yet the subsequent \u201cshowdown\u201d occurs in the middle of a forest without much consequence, leaving the dynamic between them unaltered.\\n\\n\r\nJean learning of his royalty status also makes for weak drama. He and Mauve cross paths on a sidewalk in Dowa where she drops the info bomb on him. The two talk a little more about his actions and his suspected involvement, but this revelation does not lead to anything more plot-wise.\\n\\n\r\nThe gifted cigarettes are even more anticlimactic. Upon visiting a new district, Jean receives an oddly designed cigarette that will presumably hold major significance or be used for something grander later. Nope. Instead, they simply represent each districts commitment to the coup. Something that Jean already knows and hears regularly when he talks with the nation\u2019s different peoples directly.\\n\\n\r\nTo the anime\u2019s credit, it does itself a service in providing a full backstory into the origins of this tale and how Jean\u2019s situation came about. Episode eight goes back in time, taking on different perspectives and highlighting the series of events that eventually led Jean (and Nino and Lotta) towards their strange lifestyles. This dramatic reveal, unlike almost all others in the show, gives an appropriate amount of time, an appropriate amount of detail, and an appropriate amount of importance.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the dramatic reveals, there\u2019s also trouble with the districts themselves. As the title of the show describes, thirteen distinct districts split up the entire nation. A territory where, like Texas, everything is bigger. A city gung-ho about gambling. A tropical place where the inhabitants live uncharacteristically long lives. As Jean travels abroad, the audience comes to see that each district truly does have its own personality.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this separation also leads to a disconnect. These districts neither affect one another nor ACCA, failing to introduce anything wholly relevant to the plot save for representing another area that Jean visits. Plus, as the season progresses, the anime must make way for the reveals and the backstory and the ensuing finale, leaving even fewer chances for ACCA and the districts to make a name for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s a problem. Thematically, the anime argues for two key points: the necessity of order and the existence of individualism. The former comes through in ACCA\u2019s ideals, the continued peace of the nation, and the looming threat of a coup that drives the story. The latter comes through in those districts and the uniqueness with which they handle and portray themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThese two points are linked. Order gives the districts the freedom to express themselves, and individualism gives way to a nation that respects ACCA\u2019s guidance. Throughout the season, the anime likewise makes this connection between the two. Each district has their own strengths, their own wishes, and their own presentation that shape their identity, and ACCA\u2019s representatives watch over their territories, taking in their culture while managing their direction.\\n\\n\r\nYet ACCA almost never challenges this symbiotic relationship between order and individualism. Instead, it keeps the disconnect going \u2013 to the point that it\u2019s way too late. The threatening coup that the anime has been building towards the whole season doesn\u2019t actually happen, and, when the districts finally do come together, there\u2019s no meaningful exchange. They don\u2019t share interesting words or create thoughtful ideas. It all amounts to an unfulfilling ending that makes the audience wonder what was so important about this story to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode four, where Jean travels to Suitsu district, marks one of the only times such a challenge occurs. Stuck in 1700\u2019s America, their coup (lots of coups in this show) demonstrates what happens when too much order takes hold, inviting Nino\u2019s involvement, Jean\u2019s promise to hide what went on, and the show\u2019s arguably only memorable sequence.\\n\\n\r\nDespite so much misplaced importance, the anime does try out other narrative routes. An assassination subplot targets both Lotta and Jean, but Lotta\u2019s lacks reasoning and Jean\u2019s isn\u2019t too effective since Nino (willingly) stepped out of the picture for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the real coup forming under Lilium\u2019s leadership, but it\u2019s not handled well. It\u2019s introduced too late, and it\u2019s rather convenient that Pranetta district strikes fortune to keep the nation afloat (since Lilium\u2019s district\u2019s defection means no more resources for anyone). And why would Jean even be manipulated by them in the first place? He never showed signs of that throughout the season, and his calm approach to life wouldn\u2019t make him an easy target whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does reveal that Owl, Jean\u2019s supervisor, was the guard that watched over Schnee, served as Nino\u2019s secret boss, and destroyed Jean\u2019s letters for reassignment. And there\u2019s symbolism attached to the red bird: freedom, optimism, peace. But these small details are not nearly enough to make up for the anime\u2019s numerous narrative problems.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAlthough ACCA\u2019s narrative structure lacks cohesion, its artistic direction makes for an entirely different case.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s mainly seen in the characters\u2019 designs. Their generally taller, lankier builds give them an air of maturity, and the decorated ACCA uniforms \u2013 all black with gold and red accessories \u2013 up their professionalism. They do at times go for the classic multicolor hair choices \u2013 dark-blue hair for Mauve (which is quite ironic), green hair for Payne, pink hair for Moz \u2013 that seem to go against the more realistic direction of the show itself. But this diversity matches that of the districts and their own diverse personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThese districts often have new scenery for the audience to admire. Idyllic plains with hills and grass. An underground civilization made of rock and stone. Red, mountainous regions. Snowy forests. Beautiful flower gardens amidst Egyptian-esque buildings. In essence, the very nature of ACCA\u2019s plot provides many opportunities for the anime to showcase its diverse nation. Opportunities that it clearly takes full advantage of.\\n\\n\r\nThis scenery speaks nothing of the softer style portrayed or the more localized spots like the cozy bakery, the stalwart castle, and the headquarters of ACCA. It also doesn\u2019t give insight into the anime\u2019s actual animation which, sadly, does not maintain a similar quality as that of the background art. Mostly because there isn\u2019t much movement going on at all.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, ACCA can\u2019t do much about the lack of movement when the show\u2019s cool vibes demand a more subdued presentation. Moreover, the action therein doesn\u2019t rise above the level of a chase-and-getaway sequence.\\n\\n\r\nTo make up for the subpar animation, then, the show incorporates a few directorial techniques to help improve engagement with the visuals. Certain shots provide interesting perspectives like when the camera takes on a fisheye lens atop the table where Jean and Mauve speak over dinner. And lighting as well as other small details, like creased clothing and a wide range of sky patterns, keep time and realism in mind.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the show can falter slightly in its artistic integrity with the rare slipup of a character\u2019s facial model. But the opening track\u2019s and ending track\u2019s respective visuals demonstrate that such slipups can be forgiven. For the OP, it involves a ton of different styles, colorings, and tricks that perfectly fit the super-cool vibe of both the show and the song. For the ED, the rough approach adds a floaty element to the dancing, and the choreography of the dance itself follows the emotional weight of the dancer\u2019s pleas.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to ACCA and its cast, the anime unfortunately does not give them their due for one reason or another. To put it differently, the anime refuses to involve many of the characters or simply leaves them unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nTo start, and to be fair, many of the characters aren\u2019t that essential to the plot. The different supervisors for the districts are simply there to show ACCA\u2019s reach, and Qvalum, the king\u2019s royal advisor, controls events in secrecy but doesn\u2019t necessarily need anything else on him to play his part. Even Jean\u2019s younger sister Lotta isn\u2019t \u201crequired\u201d to have more to her character since she is not a vital piece of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis argument begins to degrade once the scope tightens to those closer at the heart of ACCA. Rail, the side character who has a crush on Lotta, fails to find love, fails to protect Lotta, and fails to contribute anything besides furrowed gazes at Jean. There\u2019s also three of the five main ACCA generals who may as well have never existed since two of them barely have more than ten lines total throughout the season and one of them had patriotism for his district about three different times.\\n\\n\r\nEven if one excuses these characters for not being more involved in the story, two characters in particular are tougher to justify for their similar sidelined status: Mauve and Schwan.\\n\\n\r\nMauve stands as the idol of ACCA. A responsible leader and steadfast protector, she seeks to keep not only ACCA whole but also order maintained as much as possible. Thus, she investigates into the happenings of the potential coup \u2013 only for the higherups to stop her in her tracks.\\n\\n\r\nSo, she enlists the help of Jean to find out what he can since her hands are semi-tied. And that\u2019s the end of her character. The first three episodes characterized her, provided her purpose, and established an interesting relationship with the main character. Afterwards, though, she does almost nothing at all besides give a standard speech about ACCA\u2019s upcoming centennial event and talk briefly with Jean about his roots. I.e., despite being propped up as this major player in the game, the anime refuses to let her on the field.\\n\\n\r\nSame thoughts go for Schwan. The king sired only daughters, so as the son of the king\u2019s youngest child and the next in line to claim the throne, Schwan expects to take over the proceedings early on. When he does, he will make his first decree: the disbandment of ACCA (hence the people\u2019s coup). But the king doesn\u2019t relinquish his seat, infuriating the young prince.\\n\\n\r\nLike Mauve, though, that\u2019s the extent of his character. He has a liking for Lotta (who he doesn\u2019t know is his cousin), and he passive-aggressively lets certain events unfold, like hanging his picture in front of the king\u2019s favorite sitting spot and not stopping his aunt from attempting to assassinate both Jean and Lotta. Otherwise, he sits around eating bread, playing with his sword, and berating his subordinates without receiving any other important character developments.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes his situation worse than Mauve\u2019s because of how the story progresses. In the final episode of the season, ACCA enact their fake-coup plan to oust Lilium. Their \u201cdemonstration\u201d and Mauve\u2019s words convince the prince to keep ACCA around. That\u2019s a nice gesture, but there\u2019s no basis. No reason for him to suddenly flip his stance in the last several minutes of the anime. All because it never took the time to do more with his character throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lilium, he gets (not that surprisingly) a similar treatment. However, he\u2019s a bit more active. He approaches Jean a couple times, appears to butt heads with Grossular, and occasionally talks with some of the other side characters. Nothing extensive, but it\u2019s there. His big development comes from the fact that he is the mastermind behind the upcoming coup. By getting Jean on the throne, he plans to manipulate the man and have his own district take over the nation.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s reiteration at this point, but his motivation isn\u2019t impactful simply because this information comes about too late. Worse still, his tenuous relationship with Grossular isn\u2019t that exciting or meaningful for the same reason. As for Grossular, more of the same words apply. He has one interesting aside with Jean in episode six within his own district where Jean remarks how he respects Grossular and does not believe he is a part of the coup. Otherwise, he sits at the Five Chief Officers\u2019 table, taking on the role of pseudo-leader of ACCA and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s a surprisingly easy explanation for why the anime skimps out on giving proper focus to Mauve, Schwan, Lilium, and Grossular. The explanation being that the story inherently forces almost all its attention on Jean and his travels. The focus follows Jean, so, because these characters almost never tag along with him, they lose out on appropriate developments.\\n\\n\r\nSuppose, then, that these characters are, like the smaller side characters, also excused for their misplaced focus. This excuse-filled situation leaves the only two characters who remain consistently at the forefront of ACCA\u2019s narrative: Jean and Nino. A question arises: Do the two best friends rise to the challenge of carrying this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFor Jean, the answer is a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Jean is a man known for two things: for wanting to leave his position as the head of the Territory Inspection Department and for smoking cigarettes (an upper-class item in their nation). As rumors swirl about a coup and his involvement with them, ACCA tasks the blonde-haired man with traveling to each of the thirteen districts to conduct his inspections per usual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacteristically, Jean is an emotionless man. Almost nothing fazes him; life and its weirdness create only calmness in his demeanor. He, alongside his sister, is also the proprietor of an apartment complex. Inherited after their parents sadly passed away during a horrific train accident. Mauve describes him as someone incapable of lying, and his fellow workmates respect his dutiful behavior.\\n\\n\r\nIn ACCA\u2019s case, it\u2019s debatable whether a stalwart character like Jean best fits the aims of the show. On the one hand, his reserved nature greatly helps in building the suspense and the mystery since he makes it hard for the audience to read what he\u2019s thinking. Plus, he doesn\u2019t let anything get to him, making him rather uninterested in coups and kings and courts.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, his lack of a more interesting personality hurts his chances at becoming a more well-defined character. Furthermore, the biggest argument against Jean comes from what he did and didn\u2019t do. He did visit all thirteen districts; he did not let his journey affect him.\\n\\n\r\nHe goes to all these places. Meets all these people. Discovers all that there is to this nation (something that his mother would have appreciated). Simultaneously, he learns of his heritage, almost loses his best friend, and even takes part in the fake coup.\\n\\n\r\nACCA sets him up as the perfect person to take over the throne since he, more than anybody, understands what this nation is about. But that doesn\u2019t happen. Instead, come the anime\u2019s end, he\u2019s in exactly the same spot as he has always been. No different worldview. No different outlook. No different thoughts. He\u2019s just unfazed, unchanging Jean from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nFor Nino, the answer is a wishy-washy \u201cmaybe.\u201d Nino (codename \u201cCrow\u201d) is Jean\u2019s best friend, the two almost daily eating a meal and drinking alcohol at whatever restaurant suits their fancy. He\u2019s close with Lotta, too, but as more of an uncle than a brother or romantic interest.\\n\\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Jean (for a time anyway), Nino keeps track of the cigarette peddler from afar. Not as a stalker but instead as a spy, relaying information back to Grossular about what the potential coup sympathizer does during his inspections. Nino also confides in another, more mysterious figure. His behind-the-scene ploys and various actions are some of the biggest drivers behind the anime\u2019s mystery, making him already a vital player in this tale.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the season, Nino sates Lotta\u2019s worries about her big brother, protects Jean from wooden poles and metal bullets, and works his butt off in the shadows. Yet episode eight does the most work for his character. The twenty-minute-long flashback highlights how Nino went with his father to watch over Schnee (Jean\u2019s mother) and her eventual family. Living a life of secrecy, becoming friends with Jean in high-school, and losing his father in the same train accident that also killed Jean\u2019s parents.\\n\\n\r\nNino\u2019s position and situation create a very interesting relationship between him and Jean. To Nino, Jean isn\u2019t just his best friend. He\u2019s also the only person he has left. Yet he could never be as close or as forthcoming as he probably would have liked. Always a camera-lens length away, he kept a thoughtful, watchful eye on the would-be prince while also sincerely looking out for him as best he could.\\n\\n\r\nCome the end of the season, when Nino no longer must take pictures of the king\u2019s extended family and can finally choose his own path, Nino rides away on a motorcycle. However, true to his character, he comes back, meeting with Jean not because he needs to but because he wants to. Sharing their relationship over food, alcohol, and a bit of reminiscing.\\n\\n\r\nDoes one okay-ish character make up for the main one remaining unaffected by the events he experienced and almost everyone else having little to zero impact? That\u2019s a resounding \u201cno,\u201d too.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nJust as with ACCA\u2019s artistic direction, much of the music within the anime oozes style and coolness that forms the mature vibe of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this style more prevalent than in its opening track. Titled \u201cShadow and Truth,\u201d a bit of reverb and a bunch of bongos get the song rolling. Sharp and wild saxophones with light piano work and a killer beat form a cool backdrop, and some English rapping brings the hip-hop funk. (\u201cSilhouette, conspiracies, indefinite; never fool, gotta stay cool, smoke another cigarette.\u201d)\\n\\n\r\nOnce the female vocalist steps in, the track officially flies high, her sensual singing and those of the other harmonizing singers smoothing out the piece that much more. It\u2019s just too cool for school, standing proud as one of ACCA\u2019s best traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack continues with the coolness through more jazz and rhythmic tunes. \u201cCigarette No. 13\u201d uses lots of bass guitar and timed snaps for a weighty feel that knows it has nothing to fear. \u201cIn the Night Wave\u201d goes with a cello and a slow, slow electric guitar that invites a moment\u2019s rest. \u201cCold Talk,\u201d arguably the best track offered, combines a slick riff, a steady drum beat, and the occasional piano strokes to create a piece that practically defines the word \u201csmooth.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOther tracks aim for more of the mystery. \u201cMovin\u2019 On\u201d uses a faster pace and more grating effects. \u201cBehind the Haze\u201d uses a deliberate, singular piano note. \u201cBreach of Faith\u201d uses xylophones and ambient sounds. \u201cIrregular Point\u201d goes back and forth, both in playing and on the ears, with its music.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s even more variety available, and the examples above are only taken from the first disc of this two-disc, forty-five-track-full OST. Metaphorically speaking, the whole package deserves a district all its own.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there aren\u2019t any noteworthy voice-acting performances throughout the season. But the ending track does what it can to make up for this loss. Unexpectedly, though, the ED chooses something neither smooth nor cool but instead graceful. Light piano and soft singing dance across the ears, evoking a sense of beauty and longing in the listener.\\n\\n\r\nThe song goes for something completely different when compared to the music that precedes it. Arguably, it\u2019s unfit given the anime\u2019s style and the direction of the plot itself. Even so, the track proves that ACCA can do more than just cool and smooth.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAs I was watching this one, I had a couple of guesses for who the ultimate mastermind behind the coup would be. I attributed \u201crankings\u201d to them based on their plausibility and intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cway-too-obvious and really bad writing\u201d choice was Grossular because that was too easy and too clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nJean was the \u201cyou can\u2019t trick me\u201d choice since I knew the anime had the option to go with an unreliable narrator the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nMauve was my \u201cthis is the correct answer\u201d answer because she was in that innocuous position of coup preventer, and it seemed to me that she would make for the best twist.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Lotta was the \u201calmost no chance but just in case\u201d guess since I wanted to cover the conspiracy-theory bases and make it known that the show did not \u201cget\u201d me in case they went for the super-ultimate plot twist. Also, it would have been crazy to see how they would handle it.\\n\\n\r\nLo and behold, Lilium was the culprit all along. I admit, and as is evidenced through my guesses above, that I was wrong, tricked. But I can\u2019t say I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s my whole stance with the show. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. To have the drama unfold and the mystery appease. Instead, nothing really took hold. Most districts were visited with little to zero fanfare. The same dialogue about coups and heritage were thrown about to ill effect. Its themes and writing didn\u2019t get to those nuanced levels.\\n\\n\r\nIt also didn\u2019t help that I didn\u2019t like almost all the characters. Side characters like Maggie and Rail were meant to be there for semi-comedic relief, but I wasn\u2019t laughing. The prince was annoying. Grossular and the other generals were never as intimidating as they needed to be. Lotta ate bread and sweets. Worst of all was Jean. Emotionless and plain, he turned out to be one of the more forgettable main characters I\u2019ve seen in anime, doing almost nothing else besides smoking his cigarettes for twelve straight episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOnly two characters caught my attention: Mauve and Nino.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s decision to sideline Mauve for a large portion of the season was not welcome to me. While it seemed as though she would have a bigger role to play given her involvement in the earliest episodes, Jean not working with her and the show\u2019s desire to focus on everyone but her let her potential go to waste. A shame, really.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Nino, he is to me the only worthwhile character from the entire show. Cool dude, unorthodox behavior, neat bit of backstory. If nothing else, he takes notable action throughout the season, making him better than almost everyone else by default. Which honestly says less about him and more about everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka inhales too much smoke. A neat artistic direction and a set of cool, smooth musical offerings create the show\u2019s strong style. But its weak, unfulfilling story, its lackluster characters, and its boring developments leave it coughing and wheezing and far too unhealthy.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, a dramatic mystery tale that continually misaligns itself through anticlimactic reveals, lame subplots, and an inability to challenge its symbiotic theme on order and individualism\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Good, cool character designs, diverse background art, and a few directorial techniques do a lot to make up for the mediocre levels of actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Terrible, Mauve, Schwan, and many of the other side characters don\u2019t receive nearly as much attention as they should when considering their roles, Jean remains largely unaffected by his literal nationwide journey, and Nino\u2019s intriguing relationship with Jean cannot carry everything by its lonesome\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Good, while none of the VA performances stick out, the ED dances gracefully, the OP oozes style, and the OST explodes with smoothness\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, lame choice for the mastermind behind the whole coup, Mauve was not around nearly enough, Nino\u2019s the only one who seems to do anything tangible, and nearly everything else was boring\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "The visuals were a turn off from the start. Without reading other reviews, and being curious about the works of Madhouse, I wouldn't have looked beyond that. I'm glad I did, since I got a fancy tour with warm welcomes, visiting 13 distinct locales, with strong culture defined by economics, administration, history, and social conditions.\r\nI will admit that I highly value shows with such rich settings, that go so far that investigate the reasons why the settings ended up the way they are, and this 12 episode series did that to 13 different locales, and still brewed up an intriguing story to bind it together.Bravo. Perfect 10 rating from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual quality went from questionable to fine. I saw Gonzo credited. Did these guys do the in-between animation? Not sure if it was my PC, but the frame rate seemed pretty bad at the beginning. I was suspecting that Madhouse purposely made it to pretty low standards, in consideration to budget allocated for staff or whatever. Whatever, it just proved that I can enjoy a show without pleasing eye-candy, not noticing it past the 2nd ep, though I did almost judge it by its cover...\\n\\n\r\nSubjectively, I'd rate this a 9 based on the impression it gave me subconsciously (enjoyment factor), which coincidentally caters to my likes, such as having witty bad-asses and camaraderie between misfits. Objectively, I had to factor in the poor visuals and fairly flat drama (better audio would've helped). Its story and its appeal to my personal tastes definitely carried this. I question the morality of acts such as smoking, getting drunk, gossiping, pigging out on food, gambling, politics, traveling, celebratory gatherings, etc. but I find that they're just liberties that people take part in, in such a free world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd only recommend this to a small minority of people who share such taste. I highly doubt it'd suit the tastes of typical mainstream anime fans. In fact, I think it's only animated since it's more cost effective than making it into a live drama. I wouldn't be surprised if it does turn into one.",

            "content": "ACCA 13 review\r\nWatching ACCA: 13 is a bit like riding on an old steam train. On the outside it looks utterly majestic as it awes you with its beauty. It has a great soundtrack too as it trundles through the scenic English countryside. The view outside your window is stunning as you can\u2019t help but relax as the world passes you by. All is well, but there\u2019s a slight hitch. You\u2019re not a retired tourist; you\u2019re actually a mere office clerk who\u2019s running late for work. You yell at the driver to speed up, except he continues driving at a slow but steady pace. It\u2019sonly just before the train reaches your station decides to floor it, but by then it\u2019s too late. As you step off the train you reflect on what was a bittersweet train ride; yes it was enjoyable but disappointed by the fact that you\u2019ve now probably lost your job.\\n\\n\r\nThis analogy may make no sense but I shall explain.\\n\\n\r\nACCA: 13 takes place in the kingdom of Dowa which is divided into thirteen states, each with their own unique people and characteristics. Unity of each of the thirteen states is achieved by the ACCA organization who oversees each of them. Enter Jean Otus, our calm, collected, cigarette-smoking  protagonist who works in ACCA\u2019s inspection department whose role is to stamp out corruption and misdeeds. The series follows Jean as he goes about his job conducting audit\u2019s for each of the thirteen states. For the most part all is well, or is it? Rumors are circulating within ACCA\u2019s upper ranks that a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat is brewing. The series mostly revolves around this threat as those in ACCA attempt to unravel the mystery. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is the series\u2019 main weakness. Although the plot as a whole is well thought out, it\u2019s very slow in terms of pacing. No spoilers intended but for the first six episodes, nothing significant in the overall plot actually happens. It\u2019s not until the halfway point that the series shifts into gear and the pieces of the mystery start to fall into place. Such slow starts are very off-putting as you try to get into the series and decide if the show is worth watching. By the time I watched episode 5 I was starting to get frustrated as it felt like nothing was actually happening as Jean travels around the country inspecting each of the thirteen states. At times I couldn\u2019t tell which direction the series was trying to go. I was beginning to deliberate as to whether the series was worth my time. \\n\\n\r\nHowever if you\u2019re interested in a slow-paced series without any cliffhangers; something you can watch at night to relax without the risk of getting sucked in and binge-watching the whole thing while you should be doing something more important, then ACCA\u2019s slow yet smart plotline is perfect for you. Despite the plot being shrouded in mystery, you don\u2019t need to be Sherlock Holmes in order to watch it as it\u2019s a fairly laid back series. If I was to give it an analogy, it\u2019s like lying down relaxing while smoking a cigarette (much like Jean\u2019s in fact, minus the negative health impacts). \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re willing to persevere some of the series\u2019 finer points will keep you interested. This included the characters and their interactions. Each significant character has a unique and interesting personality, but through the dialogue you get the sense that each is hiding something. It\u2019s hard to tell their true intentions until the gears fall into place, adding to the intriguing mystery of the series. Only Jean and Niino (Jean\u2019s childhood friend) are given considerable character development or back story, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn\u2019t really matter considering the series\u2019 short 12 episode length.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also a highlight with nice painted backgrounds, simple colour pallets and attractive, yet proportioned character designs. ACCA: 13 definitely has a unique yet realistic style to it. The soundtrack is nice as well with a cool jazz & piano tone. The opening in particular is a highlight of the show with loud vivid contrasting colours and an upbeat trumpet and saxophone tune that really puts you in the right mood. Normally I skip the ending themes as I\u2019d rather just start watching the next episode. However with a soft piano ballad, I honestly regret not listening to ACCA\u2019s ending earlier as it\u2019s a beautiful tune. Thanks to the animation and sound, I consider ACCA to be a series that oozes with style and cool! I have no complaints with the voice acting either; pretty much all the characters were on point.  \\n\\n\r\nSo I ask; was the train ride worth it? I hope it was. Overall ACCA 13 is an anime that oozes with cool that impresses with a smart well-thought-out plot and interesting characters. However the positive experience was almost completely spoiled by its slow start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: This is my first review.",

            "content": "I generally found this anime extremely refreshing. I can't deny that I love myself a very jazzy political anime. I love the stoic personality of the MC and the characters around him are refreshingly realistic. I believe every character had sufficient development throughout the short series. \r\nThe plot was very well thought out, the soundtrack although a bit repetitive at times was undeniably enjoyable and the art was beautiful. I especially loved the character designs, I liked the thin tall characters that all looked way too attractive in their uniforms. I loved the characters facial expressions. Not trying to spoil but when Jean blushes itis so unexpected and the way the colour is distributed on his face, on his cheeks and the tips of his nose. I kinda just fell in love with the artist. And their outfits. I just love me some uniforms.\\n\\n\r\nTalking on the characters themselves I generally would just watch this anime for the MC. Jean is literally such a relaxing, 'I give zero shits' laid back character that is generally enjoyable to watch. Inside an anime that is stressing about a coup and civil uprisings, he's in his own little world, calmly taking everything in his stride.\\n\\n\r\nBut lets forget about a serious review right now. The only thing I want to say is:\\n\\n\r\nNINO X JEAN.....IS CANON.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI mean come on they are literally meant to be with each other. I don't want to give spoilers but the focal point about of this anime is definitely the relationship between Jean and Nino. It feels natural. I watched the sub and the dub and I have to say in both there is this undeniable chemistry between the characters, so firs kudos to the voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime begins with Nino and Jean and ends with Nino and Jean, even without the mindset of a fujoshi fangirl such as myself you will find yourself falling in love with their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nDub or sub this is a brilliant anime. I can't get the opening song out of my head now. Well there you have it. This is my haphazard review, and from it I'm sure you can easily tell that I freaking loved it!!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeace! I'm out of here!!!",

            "content": "BRIEF SUMMARY: 7/10\r\nACCA 13, while produced fantastically, falls short in its presentation of the story and in its character development. This is only evident from around the 10th episode onwards, but it impacts the ending enough to drop the rating from what would have been a high 8 or maybe even a 9 to a low 7.\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nThe story of Jean, his family, and his compatriots is undoubtedly fantastic, filled with twists and turns that would satisfy even the most hard-core of thriller and mystery fans. The beginning is a bit slow, but the more episodic parts of the first few episodes serve to givethe viewer a better idea of Jean and Nino's personalities. The show then begins to pick up the pace and grow more exciting by the minute, leaving us with cliffhangers every week. The problem begins in episode 9, when the producers decide to resort to exposition dump to explain the most intricate plot twists and developments. This drastically detracts from the excitement that once held me captive, making what could have been fantastic a boring retelling of events. Again, the story in itself is great, but the method of delivery wastes the vast potential built from episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nACCA is Madhouse show, and looks like one. The character designs were a little unimaginative in some cases, but the color palettes were fantastic and always matched the mood at hand. Some background animations grew sloppy near the end of the show, and it seemed like the animators resorted to still images a little too often, creating the impression of laziness.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe same thing can be said for the show's OST, Madhouse rarely fails to provide with its openings and background tracks. The music brilliantly moved from jazzy to tragic with the development of events, bringing the viewer along with the characters's emotional journeys.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe two characters that I think were handled well were Grossular and Lilium, both of whom kept their motives and personalities relatively constant throughout the numerous plot twists involving them. Even though their roles change, they're still fundamentally the same people, a trait that cannot be said of the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nJean is developed fantastically up until the 11th episode or so, from which point he seems to do a total 180 with his personality. I understand why the author wrote such a change, but I don't think it was the right choice to make. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Nino is a vital character to the story, I believe too much time was spent on his backstory and emotional development, especially towards the end of the show. I think the time would have been better spent explaining plot twists through action rather discussion (as described above).\\n\\n\r\nAny attempted growth in the other characters fell short. This was most notable with Lotta, Mauve, Maggie, and Prince Schwan. They were important characters, but either didn't receive enough attention, or were just annoying. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI think this bothered me more than other people that watched ACCA through  to the end, but the aforemnentioned exposition dump really took down my enjoyment of the anime. It made up for this fault in the art and sound departments, but I was a little pissed off by the 12th episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nACCA was really close to being a really great anime, but fellaeshort in its last couple of episodes. While the art and sound are fantastic, the exposition dump was a real shot in the foot.",

            "content": "Acca 13 review\r\nThe ending saved the whole anime. I like plot twists.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is set in a country which is divided in 13 districts. Acca a organization that was founded over 100 years ago controls and manages each division . Those districts we can call them small nations and each nation has his own unique characteristic that must be preserved.\r\nThe anime abords the identity theme for each nation and shows how society is divided by different categories. We have also the different social status in a society portrayed by those districts. In some districts there is poverty and hunger were people barely can affordto eat , in other one the society is undeveloped for 100 years and closed off to the real world.In other districts their is wealth and people are wasting food.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also focuses on themes like politics , corruption and power abuse. The most evident is the corruption which is a allegory to our modern society where the people with power are easy influenced and start to abuse their power. Also it shows the difference between people with power and how helpless the one who are ruled can't do much about them.\\n\\n\r\nCoup de etat this one of the most interesting and strong concepts this anime abords. Is another allegory to our history were common people changed the course of it by being revolting againts tyranny . A good example is the French revolution from 19th century were the poor people rised againts the nobility and royal family for a better life and future.\\n\r\nWhat is impressive in the anime is the fact that the coup de etat is started by the people who maintain the order a.k.a Acca 13. The anime uses a interesting plot twist scenario to do that and manages to execute it well.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding is good in the beginning has a slow pace , our main characters interact with the people and we found out about their society.Also the anime uses cigarretes to symbolize the will and dreams of each district. Let me explain. The main character receives 13 cigarretes one from each district in different colors. Those colors have different meanings and colors from white,brown, to red. Usually red implies power and authority in the anime like the Acca 13 mark color. So color symbolism related to our modern society.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this anime portrays are the rules in each district used to maintain its unicity and order. Each district has his own way of handling things and our characters experience that. This is another reference to our world where each country is separated and has his own laws that rule and guide the population.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this anime manages to portray some of our modern world hierarchy and the different social status. From rich people to poor people, people with power who abuse it, corruption within the higher branches of society and the ones who suffer from incompentent rulers which is the population.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10 \\n\r\nA clusterfuck of characters that are a mess. Some of them are just useless and for the sake of the story and some are used as plot devices. Fortunately we have capable characters too that interact and influence each other in a well executed manner.\\n\\n\r\nOtus our main character which the story focuses on him. He is calm and likes to smoke alot. We have his friend which had a great influence in his character development and their interaction is well executed.\\n\r\nThe dialogue between characters helpes the progression of the story but sometimes it drags it. Lotta the main characters little sister, used as a comic relief character and a plot device for the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show manages to shine is the plot twists executed well by the characters and the transition between the plot twits.\\n\r\nSome characters are bland and used only as background characters with no connection or influence across the story. Fortunately this doesnt ruin the main focus of this anime which is a coup de etat.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nThe animation is decent and fits the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening song is lit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 \\n\r\nThe story is told from a mature perspective and has politics,corruption and focuses on the levels of hierarchy from the human society so many won't find it enjoyable. For me it was enjoyable and interesting. It has his boring parts too but atleast its not cringy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nIt managed to portray and criticize how our society works despite his characters who some are poor written ,but like i said other characters filled some gaps and the transition between plot twists was well executed so the show managed to convey his message to the viewers.",

            "content": "I must say, this anime is definitely one to take a serious look at. At first, when I was going to dive into it, the score was a 7.20~ish so I decided to let it ride for a little more time. When it rose to 7.41+, I decided to start- and when I did, I couldn't stop! \r\nThe animation isn't totally consistent, but not to the point where it's a bother. The style is pretty retro, like early 2000\u2019s retro, but with the modern clarity it's very enjoyable. Loving the op theme and bgm, has a jazzy feel to it; in contrast the ed issofter. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about the pace of the plot is that for a 12-ep series, it gradually builds up instead of totally throwing the climax at you at the last moment. \\n\\n\r\nAt some point, you notice all the allegories to America, mainly scenery-wise (for the sake of keeping spoilers to a minimum), which I thought was kinda cool. \\n\\n\r\nI love the characters: none completely static, all fit into their roles (the wonderfully-told flashback ep really helps), and there weren't any I found annoying. The main character, the average Joe at his job and very normal, finds himself in the midst of \u201cfavors\u201d by some of the top elites. At the same time, he learns many things, both about himself and the country. The interactions between the elites themselves are all the more interesting and nothing is blatantly obvious, while it may be a little predictable (which is good sometimes) after things start to come together. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the creator\u2019s previous popular works, I knew what to expect going into it. I'm not at all disappointed and am getting very much needed excitement and entertainment out of it. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended!!!!!!!!!!!! OvO)/\u201d\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR Section at the end of the review. This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.\r\nACCA: 13-ku Kansatsu-ka is my pick for the most underrated show of Winter 2017. With a different type of story, slow pacing, and fascinating characters, ACCA kept me so intrigued week after week after week.\r\nThe story revolves around Jean Otus, the second-in-command of the Inspection Department of ACCA. While starting off very slow, many questioned if ACCA was going to do okay this season or not. However, this slow build is exceptionally well executed for the story and the show, and is what really made the show great. Atfirst, it seems to be just a show of Jean's experiences in the different districts, which in itself is not that exciting. What also made this enjoyable was the diversity and uniqueness to each district, and how they handled whatever the problem might've been at the time. This alone hooked me, as it was so fun and relaxing to watch how someone might go about a problem whilst thinking how you would personally go about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as well start off slow, with Jean appearing as an aloof, go-with-the-flow kind of guy. That changes drastically throughout the story as he makes his rounds through all of the districts. Nino, the ever mysterious best friend to Jean makes you want to sincerely know what his backstory is, and how heavily he'll affect Jean and the others. Lotta, Jean's younger sister, is a (cute) young girl who runs the apartment complex they stay at, all the while keeping an upbeat and cheery outlook on everything (including sweets. Lots of sweets). As more and more characters get introduced, you find yourself surrounded in a vast cast of unique and superbly interesting characters. The one drawback to such a wide display is that there are a lot of things to remember and to keep in mind when seeing each character, as well as the fact that ultimately, it's centered around Jean (some characters suffer due to this).\\n\\n\r\nACCA boasts a visually attractive art style that fits the type of story nicely, along with a great OST (man, that OP is catchy as hell)! Even the main ED of the show was regarded as one of the best this season, and for a good reason. Madhouse does an excellent job of making this look good, sound good, and feel good.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: ACCA is a slow political/drama show with lots of emphasis on diversity and character development. While focusing on the main character Jean, ACCA still does a terrific job of keeping you highly interested for what may happen next, regardless of the outcome. Highly recommended if you're okay with the slow pace that the show takes to truly introduce and explain everything.",
