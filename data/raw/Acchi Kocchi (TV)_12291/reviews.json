            "content": "\u201cUm, m-marriage is where your life goes to drink.\u201d \r\nWhen I first saw this anime while browsing for brand new anime releases, this anime came into view. My first thoughts\u2026  Probably just one of those clich\u00e9 anime comedy romances. Well I got the comedy romance part right, but the clich\u00e9 part I couldn\u2019t have been any more wrong. Forgive me Otaku God for calling this anime clich\u00e9 *goes on hands and knees* The jokes are quite fresh and new, and the romance is so adorable your most likely going to die from potential blood loss coming out of your nose. \r\nPlot: \r\nThe plot isquite simple beyond beliefs; there is no complexity about it in anyway. Even a five year old can understand it. The anime is about the love between two high schoolers, and what fate awaits them. Well to put it simply all you\u2019re watching is Io and Tsumiki\u2019s relationship grow each and every episode, while at the same time, watching the other characters bug the heck out the both of them, mostly Tsumiki though.  Even though this anime requires no extreme thought into understanding what the fudge it\u2019s about, this anime is probably the only anime of its kind that has a perfect way of displaying plot development. Each and every episode, it shows a subtle amount of growth in a relationship from grabbing onto a coat to feeding your lover a spoonful of delicious goodness. This anime just isn\u2019t about romance though; it also does a heck of a good job of making me choke from the amount of laughter produced. Sure not every part of this anime is so funny that it\u2019s enough to make Grumpy from Snow White laugh, but hey I betcha a quarter that he would sniffle a giggle. Which means, whether you\u2019re a Happy or a Grumpy you\u2019re definitely going to laugh, giggle, snort, or even nose bleed when watching this comedy romance filled Heaven! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nSoon to be lovers, Io and Tsumiki are the ideal anime couple of 2012 with their excellent way of showing character development! Each and every episode, one way or another, shows some tiny sign of character development which is definitely one of Acchi Kocchi\u2019s proud strong points. Their budding relationship is so cute that it even puts Kamichama Karin\u2019s Kazune and Karin\u2019s adorable relationship to shambles! Now why don\u2019t we highlight the extraordinary features of these soon to be lovers? Tsumiki is not your average tsundere, unlike most tsunderes she has that cool and collective attitude that boys go crazy for, however that\u2019s not all; she has her cute side too which proves it with those kawaii cat ears that pop up now and again.  Tsumiki is also a fantastic cook, adorable singer, and a super strong woman. There\u2019s no doubt that she\u2019s the ideal woman for most men! Now last but not least let us introduce the one the only, Io Otanoshi! Io may be quite oblivious to many things, but he makes up for it with those devilish good looks and charm that the Gods and Goddesses of Anime had blessed him with. Io like Tsumiki, is also a fantastic cook, but that\u2019s not all, he\u2019s also got the skills of a ninja! He\u2019s every woman\u2019s dream man! But that\u2019s not at all, Acchi Kocchi also has Hime Haruno our nose bleeding princess, Sakaki the awesome pevert who is strangely similar to Yohei Sunohara, and Mayoi Katose the strange girl with a knack for technology. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I have learned from watching countless  anime shows with a variety of different and yet unique art styles, I have come to the conclusion that the art style used in an anime should somehow fit the plot and genre of the anime. For example, in a horror anime, you need a somewhat mysterious and dark feel which will cause the hearts of its viewer a feel of slight uneasiness.  In this case, however, you have a romance comedy anime with its goal being to somehow cause the hearts and souls of its viewers a feeling of relaxation, happiness, laughter, and adoration. To successfully put all these wonderful feelings together the animators had used an art style similar to that of Lucky Star\u2019s. However, that is not all; the animators had also used graphics, effects, and the hearts and souls of those who love cute things too not only woo their viewers into a zombie like state in which people will stare adoringly at their computer screen, but also a near death experience where the viewer\u2019s soul have somehow died and gone to a world of pure bliss. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the meaning of love; I just want to look at you all the time.\u201d That my anime friends are a small part of the cutesy lyrics to the anime\u2019s opening \u201cAcchi de Kocchi de.\u201d Like most openings to animes the lyrics somehow in some way relate to the anime\u2019s plot, cutesy and romantic for this one. The voice actors used in this anime are in no doubt, specialists. These seiyuus had successfully and utterly pulled down the red carpet and walked dazzlingly across it smilingly handsomely at all those other rejected seiyuus and said, \u201cTough luck kids, maybe next time.\u201d Very unbelievable if I do say so myself that a few voice actors could be as so professional as to pull off the stupidity, cuteness, embarrassment, and all those other fanciful adjectives I type randomly just to make this paragraph longer. \u201cIf I grin and nyaa, I\u2019ll know you\u2019ll scratch my back.\u201d And that was just extremely adorable lyrics to the anime\u2019s ending song \"Te wo Gyu Shite ne\u201d which is just as adorable and pleasant as Tsumiki with her cat ears which I know most people are as so tempted to pull. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nIf there is one thing I wanted to do after watching episode one of this anime, it was to dance around in my underwear like a strange lunatic while smiling and listening to anime music. If you are wondering if I have problems than yes, yes I do. But that does not change the fact that this anime is so wonderful that every Otaku will get up and scream of joy, while watching Tsumiki go moe on them! I also got into the strange habit of saying cat like things; I have the strange urge to do so. But yes if you want me to get right into the point than yes, yes I 100% did enjoy watching this anime, so much that I want to dance happily in my own little world where my crush will someday pat me in the head lovingly and feed me a spoonful of food. My gosh, I\u2019m sure every girl wants their crush to do that to them! Don\u2019t worry ladies, I\u2019m sure someday your prince will come.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Normally someone wouldn't even bother to look at an anime that admits to have cliched characters in its synopsis. Nowadays, I normally wouldn't even touch an anime that looks like it could turn into a harem. However, the cover of Acchi Kocchi just attracted my attention so much that I just couldn't resist its cuteness. No one can. Thus, I started to watch the first episode, having low expectation and knowing it could turn into a horrible school harem. Upon finishing the first episode however, I found myself an easy-going little comedy gem.\r\nThe plot usually starts off with the main male character Io meeting upwith his female friend, Tsumiki, who waits for him in different, but seemingly familiar settings. They then walk together somewhere, meeting up with friends on the way while committing some mischief throughout the episode. However, what's different about this series than most school dramas is that the setting changes I would say consistently, which makes it more interesting to watch. Also, the characters may be archetypes, but they're hilarious.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTsumiki is perhaps the coolest main character ever; she can beat guys at video games, has a feminine side, and \u00a0cat ears. Tsumiki definitely reminds me of lucky star as well as Toradora, she almost seems like shy version of Taiga with cat ears. Then there's Io, who I'm not going to go into details about since there's not much known about him, but he's definitely a very kind person and Tsumiki obviously likes him.\u00a0Thus, a compassionate romance is bound to happen, but a fatuous relationship isn't out of question either.\\n\\n\r\nAll the side characters are archetypes: the Pervy male sidekick, \"single\" teacher, air headed females, nose-bleeding characters, etc. But wait, all of them in a single series? Yep, all the archetypes are included in one single series. So now you can have deja vu about almost every cliched characters every time you watch this series! But don't get me wrong, instead of being annoying, I'd say most of the side characters are pretty funny. If taken out of contexts, their actions just seem like a bunch of teenagers' rebellious acts, but within the context, it's almost like a well-scripted stand up comedy show.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely cute and that's all there really is to say about it. It's got beautiful designs, and the characters all have something special about them. What more could you ask for in a comedy series like this one? And like I said before some of the characters looked really similar to those in lucky star, so if you liked lucky star, do look into this series. Also, good thing there was music in the series and that it flowed pretty well with the fluent voice acting. Nothing too lyrically genius, but definitely soothing background music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, with all these elements combined together, this show illustrates a great comedy anime. The characters were so entertaining that one may find themselves in a dazzling entrancement. If you watch this show while looking for a serious drama of some sort, then you'll be disappointed. If you watch this series open-minded while looking for perhaps a lighthearted school drama, you'd be impressed at the results. Acchi kocchi definitely appealed to its audience throughout this series and is a lofty example of how relaxing a comedy series could be.",

            "content": "I usually see myself as a laid-back person more than anything. Because of that, the genre-less genre of \"slice of life\" appealed to me. With that eager and naive mindset, I dove head first into the world of...well...ordinary life. I first began with '\"Lucky Star\", but the overwhelming amount of references was beyond my knowledge. I then tried \"Nichijou\", but despite it's charm, I didn't feel that \"love at first sight\" spark. With that being my interpretation of this genre, I casually shied away.\r\nSomewhere down the line, I found \"Acchi Kocchi\". I was somewhat reluctant due to my earlier experiences, but something about the coverimage enticed me into at least giving it a shot. I've had pleasant experiences with romance tags, and this anime happened to have one also. \"Just do it.\" as Nike would say.\\n\r\nAnd so I did. Somehow, I feel so undeserving to have enjoyed this anime because of my earlier doubts.\\n\r\nThis anime made me question why \"Clannad\" or \"Chuu2byou\", albeit being quite enjoyable, had the slice of life tag. I mean, drama hidden or masked underneath a supposed regular life is still in essence a drama, right? Enter, \"Acchi Kocchi\". Absolutely no dramatic overhaul, yet still somehow a precious gem.\\n\r\nAllow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Content - 8\\n\r\nAh, I don't know. \"Story\" seems like an unfair way to rank this anime, given it's not really the goal here. There's no drama or intense feeling for the characters. Plot twists are quite simply non-existent. However, it's completely made up for (perhaps even more so) with what the creators have given us instead. It's about a group of five high school friends (With one potential unrequited lover) going about their everyday lives. Of course, there are certain out-of-the-ordinary mishaps to make it interesting, but I don't believe that's what makes it stand out to me. What I really found interesting was the way the creators make out-of-the-ordinary ordinary (Read that over a couple times), in a way that I don't believe I've seen before. Basically, all the out of the strangeness is in the heads of the cast. Thinking and imagining is normal, right? Virtually all the blasphemy happens in the character's heads. The animators have so graciously animated their wild imaginations. Needless to say, HILARIOUS! The complete randomness and extravagance of their thoughts always left me crying of laughter. Most, if not all the jokes are fresh, and not reused very often other than I do realise this may fit under the \"characters\" section of my review, but alas, I felt as though the character's thoughts ARE the plot, and should be mentioned as so.The episodes are split into two ten minute segments highlighting a certain event of their lives. I can't say they're really quite linear even with slight references back to previous episodes, meaning you could start anywhere and still appreciate it. Some might be depreciative of the lack of originality in creating the story, so I'd give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for bright and colourful. The cute art style is part of what led me to watch this anime to begin with. I have to say, it's quite interesting and fresh. The overall tone is bright and colourful. Simple character designs perfectly suit character personalities. Scenery and such are usually brighter colours than they should be, and sometimes backgrounds are filled with bubbly patterns. I really want to mention the transition scenes though. Usually they're just simple movement animation over a single coloured background, but it's quite appealing. You'd have to see for yourself. Obviously, the art doesn't aim for realism. It aims to create and support a cheerful, relaxing atmosphere, and does that outstandingly. Animation isn't astounding, but rather doesn't stand out. Really, the art is just a pleasure to look at. Though, I guess it doesn't appeal to everyone, so I'll bump it down to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are rather cute and catchy, though I must admit, I didn't really listen to them often. They do gain points for being in perfect correlation with the mood of the anime though. Perhaps it's not meant to be a needle in your heart that stays with you forever, but a relaxing, overly cheerful, pop tune. The bells and whistles (literally) during the transition scenes are very suiting, and emphasize certain things as they should. Voices perfectly suit their characters, making the atmosphere all the more real. Tsumiki's quiet, shy voice and Io's cool, sexy voice are things I'll never forget. I can't say I can really distinguish any of the OSTs from the anime, but they blend well. In a nutshell, all the sounds build perfectly towards the atmosphere, but aren't much standalone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nA very colourful cast we have here (Literally and figuratively). As mentioned before, these characters ARE the plot. Their wild imaginations and attitudes is what makes this show a show. I can't say that they have original personalities, but I can confidently say that their personalities are a new spin on an ageing old. Basically, take some of the most generic character personalities, and make them a little more relaxed and normal. BAM! You've just created the characters of this show. All characters are interesting, yet normal enough to even be your classmates in real life. Their flaws and strengths are fleshed out to the point that you really love and cherish the characters, yet mysterious enough for unexpectedness. All characters really compliment each other, as a group of friends should.  More importantly, they're very entertaining together.\\n\r\nIo - The dense lady charmer.\\n\r\nTsumiki - The short, tsundere cat-like girl in love with Io.\\n\r\nHime - The cute, friendly klutz.\\n\r\nSakaki - Laid-back prankster.\\n\r\nMayoi - Technologically smart prankster.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is quite amazing too. Heck, they're personalities are deep enough to make them main characters if they were given more screen time. All the characters work together well while at the same time each having their own unique charm; as friends should. Do I really need to say more? IT'S A BIG GROUP OF FRIENDS! (9 because they're not as original as some might hope)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOne of my favourites; period. I'll never forget it. I love it more than I can even express in words. When I'm bored, I go back and pick a random episode to re-watch and enjoy all over again. I'd recommend it to anyone and express my utter love for it if anyone would listen to boring-ol'-me.  If you're looking to jump into the slice of life genre, or even in you're not for that matter, watch \"Acchi Kocchi\". You don't need to be an otaku and know a ton of references to fully enjoy it. You don't even need to think to enjoy it. Just relax and let this anime take you Place to Place.",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi, the anime adaptation from yonkoma manga (4 cell/panel manga) that begin aired around 2012. Several words that came up to describe it are funny, cute and adorable! How the story goes that sometimes make me laugh out loud because of its joke in it, all those cute, adorable and memorable character are the reason that Acchi Kocchi is worth to watch for all of you who really enjoy gag anime and a little bit of daily life romance in school. Although, there are several reasons for me why I give it fair. Specifically, I will explain it below:\r\n(*) Story\r\nHow the story told inprocess consist of two part in one episode, there's Part A and Part B. Most of it linked to one another, but there's several episode was not. The story itself is simple like most love stories, there's a girl who falls in love with a guy though their personality is cross apart but somehow they could make romance situation filled with sweetness aura. I don't know how to describe it specifically, but besides the simple and mainstream story, it surely gives us an expression of moe that makes the audience feel relax and enjoy the story. The other points, the romance itself has a small percentage compared to its joke or comedy. For the ending, I would like to say that it's not certainly enough to me for say that is a good ending, but I would not say that is a bad ending either. For all, I would say that is fair enough and could interest to watch for the very beginning till the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nThe art is good enough. It's from gag manga, after all, the creator may need it to expand their story and character as flexible it can to make the audience not bored and enjoy. Though, those efforts don't work on several condition. But, it is memorable and fit the story. I'd like to say that it's cute art.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nI love the seiyuu, the OP and ED theme and a little touch of back sound that give us a fit sense to watch this anime. The character voice of Rumi Okubo fits Tsumiki well, same as Nobuhiko Okamoto who fits Io too. I just love them all! And somehow I liked Kyouya voice too, it's cool rather than the others. The opening and ending are good and fit the story. It's a good job for this point!\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nThe character is memorable enough. Tsumiki the tsundere girl, Io the cool guy, Mayoi, and Sakaki are the duos who enjoy teasing and make pranks and last but not least is the innocent adorable character, Hime-chan. The characters don't have any specific development till the end of the stories. But it well received for this anime because of the storyline and for the fact, the characters from the story itself that the reason this anime is different than others. It\u2019s unique and everyone want to adore them. Like Tsumiki and Hime for example, I want to pinch and own them if they really exist!! That kind of expression that makes Acchi Kocchi is memorable with its cuteness.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nI got bored while I watched it, maybe because of the same story concept that appears in several times, but despite it, I watched Acchi Kocchi till the very end. It because somehow I like the characters that available in the story and the soundtrack that make me want to singing it with copying Io and Tsumiki voice till I got tired myself. In conclusion, it could somehow make me want to watch it more and it fair enough to watch for all of you who like that kind of genre with a little unique, cuteness and moe characters.\\n",

IT'S TOO CUTE ;3 \r\nThis anime really makes me wonder sometimes, why isn't life more happy? ;3\r\nReality seems more stressful, but I guess this is why cute slice of life shows the happy part of our lives ;D\r\nStory (8): There's not much of a story as it's basically a cute slice of life, sort of like Lucky Star. The main characters have a little love story going on and random things happen, that can make you laugh or drown in how 'kawaii'this anime is ;3\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (10): I love the animation, it is very well done and it has CUTENESS drawn all over it. Sound also amazing, love the voice actors and the sound effects ;D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): We got a variety of characters with unique personalities. Main guy character is very formal, you can say he has a dry-humor. His guy friend reminds me of a Sunahara from Clannad XD The main girl Tsumiki is soooooooooooooooooooooo cute, cat ears ftw. Then we got a jokester and a girl that is exactly like Rena from Higurashi (Just that she's not a yandere).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall (10): I think this anime first episode deserves more than just a 7.6 rating, probably a high 8, that's what I would give it. Very enjoyable if you like slice of life and cute things, I see it as potentially better than Lucky Star and other slice of life animes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Given the intro, graphics and such, I just figured this was another carbon copy of 'Kill Me Baby', and while many of the setups and gags were in the same vein, at least here there was a thread to follow, thin, but still a thread.\r\nI think people who watch this can be easily divided into two groups: those who scrunch up their eyebrows and say 'what?' when Mayoi is on the loudspeaker asking people to look to their right, then telling them \"there is a wall\", and then those who hear that line  and have to hit pause because they're laughing so hard.\r\nI enjoyedthe fact that the storyline didn't try to force the relationship between Io and Tsumiki.  Heck, they're comfortable, and high school is a hassle as it is, but I never expected a kiss or hug at the end.  It was good friends helping each other through their trials and tribulations, many of which were self-administered...\\n\\n\r\nMy ideal ending (I was disappointed in the anime finale) would have been to follow up on the end of episode 11, where Io feels a blush as he thinks of Tsumiki and might be realizing he has more than friendly feelings for her.  I thought they had it nailed after Part A for valentines, but in Part B, when Tsumiki thanked him for the cat treat he made just for her, I'd have shown him holding out his hand and saying something like \"Any time. Let's go home', and after a frozen second for Tsumiki, she takes his hand and they walk away from the camera toward the station.  That not only takes the relationship one small step forward, it closes the loop from the first episode when Tsumiki is trying to catch up to Io and is trying to grab his coat/arm just as Mayoi shows up.\\n\\n\r\nI can't see a second season, but I enjoyed having them as friends.",

            "content": "Honestly, i am not the type who can enjoy an anime which doesnt have any strong plot or using an \"cute\" character like Azumanga Daioh or Lucky star. But for this one its exceptional.\r\nWhy?\r\nFrom the start i am watching this anime i have a mix feelings from \"WTF\" into \"SMM (So Much Moeness)\". I dont really understand a bit about this one but along with a few episodes finally i got hooked...no, not hooked. but GOT IN LOVE with this one.\r\nAcchi Kocchi or Place to Place in english is a typical slice of life anime with comedy and some romance on it. The story isabout.... no, i will said. \\n\\n\r\n\"Have you ever feel being teased by your friends because you got crush on somebody?\"\\n\r\n\"Did you feel annoyed by being teased or maybe happy because of it?\"\\n\\n\r\nThat question was enough to describe on what this anime is about. Summary, this anime was about Tsumiki who loves Io but she cant express it in front of him. So, her friends\" helping\" her with teasing her and Io so she can honest to herself. \\n\\n\r\nIn this 12 episodes, you will see many funny moments and romantic feeling that makes you saying \"aaaawwww... thats cute\". I am kinda surprised about this anime since my first assumption is this anime will full of pushed unfunny jokes and a bland romance. But i am wrong, this anime was full of romantic, funny, cute, amusing, entertaining, adorable, kawaiii, and *insert any good feelings on it* moments. In short, this anime was like Lucky Star or Nichijou + Romance and so we have Acchi Kocchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on this anime was top notch, i say it in \"unique\" way not in \"epic\" way.  What i mean with unique is in Acchi Kocchi they always have a summary in every scenes to explain what happen in that scene (see it for yourself, since its kinda hard to describe it). Because this anime was full with funny and cute moments, the art is supporting it with colorful and bright background and of course, cute design.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character we have in Acchi Kocchi is a circle of friends that consists of five person. Io, Tsumiki, Hime, Mayoi, and Sakaki.\\n\r\n- Io is the main character in this anime, he is someone that is senseless if its about love. Even his friends teasing him with Tsumiki, he still doesnt realize it.\\n\r\n- Tsumiki is your adorable main character. She have a crush on Io, but she is too shy to express it and so, she is being teased by her friends.\\n\r\n- Mayoi is your annoying character or friends, she is partner-in-crime with Sakaki in teasing Io and Tsumiki. She loves to teasing between these two. (everyone is definitely have a friend like this, LOL)\\n\r\n- Hime is your shy character. What is memorable for her is her bloody nose in every romantic scenes.\\n\r\n- Sakaki is like Mayoi, your annoying friends that love to tease people. In this case, is Io and Sakaki. but without him, i am sure it will not exciting.\\n\\n\r\nWith that mini description on each character, i am sure you will have imagine on how \"exciting\" this anime was. Yes, it was like in our life. We have always annoying friends but without him/her, it will be quiet and not exciting.\\n\\n\r\nSummary, this anime was an excellent choice if you want to have an enjoyable show. Its funny, heartwarming, and adorable show. Maybe some of you will doubt watching this anime because of the art. But believe me, sometimes crossing the lines or trying something new is not bad as you think (like myself).",

This is most likely due to the lack of comedic and romance I value in most anime. \r\n-Story-\r\nThat being said Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place) hit home when I first started watching this. There isn't really a story per say, but there is character development within certain relationships that you can follow along. Every episode is as enjoyable as the last, Including the special.\r\n-Art-\r\nThe art is perfect for me. It's my kindof art. Its bright, cute, and certain aspects of the anime bring things to life. They put a lot of detail into the pen spinning and many other things.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nI usually don't give sound a high rating unless it's deserved. The opening and ending theme of Acchi Kocchi is beyond good. The cast was perfect for each character. Everything was brought to life in a great way. I wouldn't change a thing.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nEvery character is unique and developed with certain qualities that make you love them all. There isn't a character i find annoying enough to hate.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nThe romance and comedy is what takes the cake. Everything is cute, funny, and exciting. I look forward to hoping a second season comes around. Overall I give this a high re-watch rating.",

That's the only thing that popped up in my mind while watching the first episode of this anime. Or maybe i should say \"while constantly watching the progress bar waiting for it to end\".\r\nStory/Character: 4\r\nObviously the story isn't original at all, the summary itself makes you think of \"stereotype\", but i hoped in some parody of the characters, which is what they usually do with such blatant stereotypes. Nope.\r\nArt: 7\r\nIt's the best part of the anime, but it'snot that good either. Just \"cute\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI usually don't pay much attention to OSTs, so i can only say that OP is decent and ED is bad. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThis is where the anime fails. It's absolutely boring. I know this isn't a comedy anime, but its structure is sketch-like, so the result is... a comedy anime that isn't funny. One of the worst types of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nMaybe i should have seen where this was going from the art/summary. I wathched Lucky Star before, and someone said this was similar. For the record, i dropped Lucky Star at half series because it was a little boring. But at least there were funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nWell, i suggest not watching this, but since this has a high rating and i see a lot of people who like this just because \"it's cute\", maybe it could satisfy those kind of watchers. it surely didn't satisfy me.",

            "content": "Worst anime I have seen in my life. 12 episodes was too much to endure for a show with so little meaning and purpose behind it. Those 288 minutes I wasted I would like repaid to me in brain cells I lost while suffering behind my computer screen in agony. Here is my review of Acchi Kocchi:\r\nPresentation: On the surface, Acchi Kocchi has a bright, chibi quirk about it that lured me in from pictures online. It LOOKS fun, bouncy, and promising from a distance but this show affirms the notion you should NEVER judge a book by the cover.\r\nStory: There is none. None whatsoever.The premise of Acchi Kocchi is that of a tsundere, cat-child hybrid who episode after episode fails to confess her lingering feelings for the object of her affections. Each episode is basically a gag reel of how main characters Tsumiki, Mayoi, Hime, Sakaki, and Io experience daily life in and out of school. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I have never met a cast so atrocious since Infinite Stratos and Love Hina. With FIVE characters at the shows disposal to develop and experiment with, they instead decided to mold each one of them to a cheap and bland Japanese stereotype. Tsumiki is the female tsundere, Io the cool charmer, Sakaki the class clown, Mayoi the instigator, and Hime the self conscious and shy girl. The stereotypes would almost be fine in MODERATION but what Acchi Kocchi does is EXAGGERATE each characters personalities (if you can even call them that) and takes them to the farthest extreme possible. The show by itself is already miserable enough, but when the lack of story and plot progression is compounded by weak and bland characters, it's insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Decent at best but mediocre if I'm being honest. The colors are bright but the character designs look like carbon cutouts from any other anime of this awful genre. Even close ups aren't spectacular which other anime typically capitalize on the most to show off the quality of the art style. The backgrounds are forgettable and even scenes which are supposed to be beautiful don't strike any real impression. The art is just as bland and soulless as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nVoices: This was almost the worst part. In conjunction with their awful personalities, the characters' VOICES detracted from any enjoyment I could possibly draw from Acchi Kocchi. Tsumiki, the neko-tsundere hybrid, had one of the most annoying and ridiculous voices I have ever heard, and this was in the Japanese version. Her voice, quiet and CONSTANTLY mumbling, managed to make itself EVEN WORSE by the \"Nya~\"s she screamed every other frame. Mayoi's voice was NO BETTER in that by trying to sound so cute (to masquerade the ill-intent of her character) made me resent her more than anyone else in the pitiful program. Sakaki sounded like a bad version of Sunohara from Clannad and Io's voice actor had to put forth such little effort to produce his voice it was barely noticeable and unmemorable. Hime WOULD HAVE had a normal voice if the actress weren't trying so hard to portray her as a overbearingly weak and sensitive baby girl.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This show tried so hard to be funny and that is ultimately what killed it. With every second a girls' nose exploding, it was almost as if they were experiencing their period busting out of their heads. Mayoi's antics were not entertaining nor were they cute. Had she performed one of her infamous gags and died in a terrible accident, THAT would have been more comedic than ANYTHING else this buttstain of a \"comedy\" tried to do. Sakaki was no better. His only point of interest was the neglect and abuse he received from characters around him who, to be quite honest, deserved to be subjected to the same cruel and unusual punishment as him. This show was not funny and the harder it tried to be, the more painful it became to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is a piece of shit. It's garbage. Maybe my problem is I came in looking for plot, story, character development, complex interpersonal relationships, and perplexing things of the like. I came for something that would challenge me, but even judging by the surface I shouldn't have expected that. This was a huge waste of my gotdamn time and I almost regret it. I'd pray for this memory to be erased from my mind but I don't even want the possibility of me trying to watch this show again in another life. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch this anime if you value yourself at all. ANY anime is better than this rubbish.",

            "content": "On the surface, Acchi Kocchi looks like your typical high school slice of life rom-com filled with overused cliches such as school festivals, beach excursions, valentines day drama, and the like. While that is an accurate description of the general concept of this show, it excelled at making me laugh through unconventional and random humor, and making me smile at the sweet and tender moments the show sets up. With a cast of adorable (albeit cliche; we have the clueless male lead, the tsundere female lead, the airheaded and innocent girl, and the over-the-top troublemakers) characters, comedy that is more than often met with alaugh or chuckle, and some innocent and sweet romance, Acchi Kocchi sticks to the conventions of the genre and brings us something relaxing and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBased off a 4-panel manga, Acchi Kocchi follows the slightly unusual lives of Otonashi Io, a quiet and reserved guy who is for the most part clueless about many things, Tsumiki Miniwa, a shy and short girl who has trouble expressing her true feelings about a certain someone, Haruno Hime, a bubbly and innocent little airheaded girl who gets excited over the budding romance between her friends, Katase Mayoi, a electronics wizard who has a knack for coming up with schemes that often leave her friends annoyed and unamused, and Inui Sakaki, Mayoi's male counterpart in crime, and rounds out our group as the hot-headed center of harassment and jokes. We follow this group of friends as they do homework, attend festivals, go to the beach, make chocolate for valentine's day, and a myriad of other activities typical high school students do.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is best described by the title, in that it really is all over the place. For anyone who has watched their fair share of high school slice of life comedies, Acchi Kocchi does come up with some hilarious original content, and most of the punchlines hit the mark while a rarer few disappoint. From watching the rest of the group fawn over Tsumiki's affections towards a nonchalant Io to seeing Sakaki receive the brunt of a bad situation, I found it hard to wipe the grin off my face while watching the show. The romance, on the other hand, is slow and mellow. The show takes the time to set up really nice moments between Io and Tsumiki, and are more often than not adorable and sweet. For any fans of romance, the romance presented in this show is easy on the eyes and heart.\\n\\n\r\nMoe is a controversial issue within the anime community; some absolutely love it while others will hate it with every fiber of their being. While Acchi Kocchi does contain a good deal of moe, it didn't diminish the quality of the comedy or the romance in any way. In fact, in most occasions, it made a bit all the more funny or a tender moment all the more sweet. Even if you're not a fan of it, Acchi Kocchi has something for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is cute and lively, and the characters are reminiscent of Nichijou's. It is somewhat childish, but is expected for a show of this genre. The animation is fluid and easy on the eyes, and parts like Mayoi doing some crazy stunt are well animated. The sound is bright and lighthearted, and will have you humming the OP even after the show is over. \\n\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi is one of those \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" series. While it may seem like a cliche moe-blob with little to no substance, it may just catch you a little off guard, and hopefully make you laugh and smile.\\n",

            "content": "When I was young, I have always enjoyed those Looney Tunes cartoons and the Disney shorts. Acchi Kocchi is one of those anime where I can go to my dentist's office and watch that without having any fear. Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true colors of moe and comedy combined.\r\nYou may think Acchi Kocchi is another rom-com anime with an indecisive main character with no attraction, but you are absolutely wrong. While watching Acchi Kocchi, it gave me a heartwarming feeling. Acchi Kocchi focuses on a maiden in love, Tsumiki Miniwa, trying to find her way into Io Otonashi's heart. You can saythat there are those lovey-dovey events, yet there are hilarious examples Tsumiki tries to approach Io. You can say the most famous romance line, \"Anata.. wa .. wa-ta-shi ~ *wink*.\" was used and it even made me baffle in love. Even though it was overused, Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true meaning of \"Do you want me\" as a good romance line. The best part was that the scene has a comedic approach that it made me cry of laughter. A good example is: Do you know that character who cock blocks? Yeah, that character's in there. I don't hate that character in Acchi Kocchi, but I would definitely hate it in real life. It is hilarious to see what Tsumiki has to face in order to achieve Io's heart. Lastly, the episodes are kept organized and neat which makes me love it. I would definitely want to see another anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unique. The anime has a moe-style which you can say that the characters look very cute and chibi. The colors are simple and the animations are great. I love simple art colors and it reminds me much of OreShura's art coloring. Animes similar to Acchi Kocchi would definitely be Lucky\u2606Star and Nichijou. If you have seen either one of them, you should definitely pick up this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. This anime focuses on moe so most of the sounds are cute. The opening is well made and the audio is cute. The ending is what got me the most. It was sung by Tsumiki (I honestly think the voice actress did a great job) and the voice actress is Ookubo, Rumi. She was the voice actress of Yoshikawa, Chinatsu in Yuri Yuri. Listening to the ending was cute and soothing. It isn't like those fast paced audio, but a good slow paced with a good beat/tone.\\n\\n\r\nWell, time to wrap up this review. It is sad that we have to depart, but I will be writing more reviews time by time. The enjoyment is very good. I was able to glue my butt onto my chair and not multi task while watching this anime. Most of people would probably text or browse forums or etc, but I had that on hold till I finished this anime. I even had pause watching the on-going anime to finish Acchi Kocchi. If you enjoy moe, romance and comedy, Acchi Kocchi is definitely for you. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who haven't seen this anime, but read my review, I have a preview for you to get you interested! Fear not, there are no spoilers and will never be in my review.\\n\r\n---   http://imgur.com/a/sXy1c\\n",

            "content": "If you want to see an anime where moe caricatures crash into each other, trip on banana peels and produce nosebleeds capable of filling up an olympic-sized swimming pool with blood every single episode then you have found your anime. If however you're looking for a more meaningful comedy then by all means skip this one out as you won't miss out on much. \r\nI have to admit I had high expectations for this anime after skimming through all the reviews and forum posts praising Acchi Kocchi's comedic wit and entertainment value. And while initially the show did manage to make me smile and chuckleon occasion during the first 2 episodes, that quickly turned into boredom and disappointment. Why? There's an easy explanation:\\n\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi has no real story to speak of. It's fully episodic nature and complete devotion to a slice-of-life theme means that it basically replays the same premise and setting every single episode. Now that in itself wouldn't be bad (basic sitcom formula) but this anime also replays the same jokes over and over again as well. Mayoi (one of the girls in the cast) trips on a banana peel, Mayoi trips on ice, Mayoi trips on a puddle of water. Now apply that to every other character and by the end of the series you'll be bored enough to actually try to lick your own elbow. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is no different. The two most common expressions you'll hear the most every single episode in roughly 15-20 second intervals are \"kawaii\" or \"kawaii desu\". Once the initial premise is established the dialogue is recycled more furiously than plastic in Germany. It basically comes down to this - girls compliment male lead. Male lead compliments them back. They nosebleed. That's pretty much it. Something like this CAN be funny but not for the entire duration of a full 12 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nSecondary male characters appeared to be the only hope later on but unfortunately they shared the same fate as the rest of the cast, only adding more fuel to this burning wreck of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only truly positive aspects of Acchi Kocchi would be the quality of animation and the fairly decent OST. While the style itself was not something I enjoyed (huge Moe overdose), the anime was done decently. The only issue with art I have would be that every other living organism apart from cats and our cast is a greyed out stationary statue. Either the studio was lazy or they decided to go with it as a \"stylistic\" choice but I didn't like it. It just made the anime as a whole look a bit cheap. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment you'll get from Acchi Kocchi will only be from the first 2-3 episodes. After that the story, characters, jokes and dialogue go into loop mode and you will not miss anything if you try to drop it after that point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was in fact a poor experience. The studio basically created a 3 episode OVA and stretched it out far beyond its entertainment value. \\n\\n\r\n4 points.",

            "content": "Normally, I am not the type of person that can sit through a slice of life anime like this with no real story (like lucky star). However this one caught my attention one day and I was gladly surprised to find that it was not that bad of a show.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe plot is very simple, its just about High-schoolers that are in love. If you are going into this anime expecting to find an amazing and deep plot, then you are going to be dissapointed. Story is the weakest part of this anime,  in fact it  does not have much of a storyto speak of. This is not necessarily a deal breaker because what it lacks story wise, it makes up for in other sections. Most of the \"plot\" consist of the main group of friends in different situations. If you just want an anime to watch that is not really demanding and is just fun, then it should not be that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi's art is very simple and colorful. It resembles the art of Lucky Star a lot and it at 1st, may turn you off of  because it looks childish. Originally I didn't watch this anime because of the art, I saw 1 picture and immediately tossed it aside. However, when I actually sat down and watched it I sort of became accustomed to it. The one thing about the art that must be said is that it really complements the anime. It fits the laid back themes of romance and comedy rather well. Also, Miniwa is adorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound track of the show, while not necessarily bad, didn't stand out to much. Aside form the really addictive and upbeat opening theme, there is no one, stand out track. The music fits when it is played and does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is were this anime (like many slice of life anime) shines. It really relies on the interactions between the characters to drive the show. The relationship between the the main 2 characters is not really new, however it is done really well. The main heroin Miniwa, is a well done character, that is in love with the main lead, but is to afraid to tell him about her feelings. Unlike most tsunderes that are normally cold towards their lovers, Miniwa just gets really shy, this is the main reason she is adorable (that and the cat ears). The main protagonist of the show Io is the extremely dense, and that cannot see that Miniwa has obvious feelings for him. In each episode they get closer to each other and it was fun to see them gradually come together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime really has made me expand my anime roster and not turn down anime at 1st glance. I fell in love with the main characters and after every episode wanted to immediately watch the next one to see them get closer.\\n\r\nI came out of this show with a smile on my face. The music and art really fit the romance and cuteness of the show and I am glad that I got around to watching this anime. It is definitely worth you're time if you like this kind of show, and I would encourage everyone to just give it a shot if you just want to sit and relax and watch a fun, simple show. While is does not set any records for originality, it does what is set out to do really well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my 1st review, Hope that it's not THAT horrible :3\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi: This Anime's Story Was All Over The Place!\r\nOkay, I know. REALLY bad pun. I just had to get it out before getting into this review.\r\nAcchi Kocchi is one of those series that I found to be just magical in its presentation. There is no \"Madoka Magica\" surprises with the cute animation though. What you see is what you get, a bunch of cutely animated HS characters doing hilariously cute things. The \"story\" revolves around a group of five high school friends participating in hilarious everyday activities, from making odd Valentine's Day chocolates for each other, to scaring each other with a bear suitand a creepily made paper bag mask. Acchi Kocchi really is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get when it comes to the random acts of comedy thrown your way.\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be the strongest aspect of this series, with the lead character essentially being a small, quiet catlike tsundere named Tsumiki. She has a strong attraction for the stoic, yet unobservant Io, a boy who's quietly romantic demeanor makes him a heartthrob for all the girls in their group. The other three members of made up of Hime, a clumsy, whimsical girl who's shyness shines when it comes to attractions of the opposite sex, Sakaki, the other boy in the group who's fantasies are less than desired by the rest of the group (and usually ends up in some sort of painful experience), and finally Yayoi, an ambitiously creative lab coat-wearing girl whose ideas usually cause trouble for the rest of the group. When I was first introduced to the members of this group, I was hesitant how this series would work, but I was amazed at the chemistry the characters shared with each other. What I absolutely loved about it was how the characters knew each other so well, they'd say and do things to try and help each other out, primarily speaking, the obvious feelings that Io and Tsumiki have for each other but neither has the courage to say. Watching Io and Tsumiki work off each other was downright adorable and the three other characters interactions added the comedy element that this anime had no shortage of.\\n\\n\r\nI found another strength of this series was just sound in general. The voice acting, the music, and even the solo performance instrumentals and sound effects running in the background made this series shine. It was able to match the tone the animation and story was setting to a T. When something quirky was happening, you could hear a solo xylophone player playing a mischievous tune. When something endearing was happening, you could hear a solo acoustic guitar player playing a heartfelt tune. It was the small nuances during the show that made the series feel heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation was simplistic and far from what we'd call \"great\", where it made up in that department was creativity. I absolutely loved the arrow themed title cards that would pop up between scenes that would hilariously map out the previous scene, or the small additions of random props that matched the joyful theme of the series, like cat ears on the curiously quiet Tsumiki.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the anime fell short was really in the story and the character development. The story is extremely non-progressive with the characters' development (or lack there of). There isn't exactly a \"story\" that these characters are really involved in. The \"story\" of this series is just the random things these five high schoolers are doing. The character development was severely lacking because all we learn about the characters is their personalities. We don't see any of their back stories, such as how these characters met or what caused them to have their extremely unique personalities. There's no \"progression\" in the story. In fact, you could watch this series COMPLETELY out of order and you would not miss any important plot points. The ONLY plot point that might be noticed if watched out of order were the two Valentine's Day episodes. Considering the sort of relationship Io and Tsumiki had with each other, it's one of those series where you're rooting for something to happen, although if you're wishing, you'll be left somewhat disappointed. Although, I will admit the buildup between Io and Tsumiki over the last two episodes appeared to be building a strong foundation for a romantic climax. I just thought it fell a little flat. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way I can describe Acchi Kocchi is it's a great series to watch if you're just looking for a simple comedy series where you can just shut the brain off and just enjoy some hilarious sketch bits. It's an endearing show that leaves you with no angst or qualms about the characters or story. It's just a simple series that's good for a pick-me-up if you're feeling down. I know I was feeling a little depressed going into this series and it managed to bring a smile to my face as I watched. It's extremely similar to Lucky Star in it's simplistically animated comedy styling while the scriptwriting is comparable to a quirky series like Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. Like I said earlier, if you go into this expecting a Madoka Magica-like twist, you're watching the wrong series. If you go into this judging solely by the \"book by the cover\" analogy, you're getting exactly what you bargained for.",

            "content": "Your first two questions when considering this anime might be \u201cIs it actually cute?\u201d and \u201cDoes it have much substance?\u201d \r\nFor the answer to the former question, I invite you to take a look at the picture of Tsumiki Miniwa on her character page. Look at that face! Can you\u2026deny\u2026that face? And look at the top of her head; even though she\u2019s a normal human, the show puts cat ears on her all the time without any explanation, just to boost her moe points. Truly terrifying. Not to mention she\u2019s shy but tries to show her feelings. Moe. Soft-spoken and thoughtful. Moe. Super short buthas a huge weird hair curl thing. Moe. And, of course, she\u2019s got a little girl crush on our male main character, Io Otonashi. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Io, if it\u2019s even remotely tenable to describe a male character as moe, then I would have to assert that Io is moe to the max. He\u2019s tall, smart, soft-spoken like Tsumiki, and is very self-reliant in a way that reminded me of Ryuuji from Toradora. Plus, despite seeming rather oblivious to Tsumiki\u2019s adoration, he doesn\u2019t actually get fazed much by girls at all. He\u2019s not afraid of physical contact, and when he wants to, he can perform embarrassing romantic lines with enough smoothness to give girls nosebleeds (e.g. the light from these fireworks pales in comparison to the light I see when I gaze into your eyes). This becomes a reoccurring joke too, which somehow never gets too old. \\n\\n\r\nNow, usually, it turns me off when I see nosebleeds used as a joke in comedies, such as in Yuru Yuri. Aside from the obvious fact that people don\u2019t generally get nosebleeds from sexual arousal, it just never appealed to me aesthetically. However, in this case, it was okay, and I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe it was because the way it was animated here looks so childish that my unconscious aversion to the blood was not even triggered. \\n\\n\r\nAnother pet peeve of mine is when a male character is so dense that it becomes an impenetrable wall against character and plot development. Even though Io sort of fits this bill at times, yet again, the show manages to win me over. In this case, their friends, particularly Mayoi, alleviates all possible frustration by being acutely aware of what\u2019s happening and pushing the pair at each with well-intentioned (or maybe not so well-intentioned) teasing (or just physically pushing them at each other :P). \\n\\n\r\nReally, this show is so self-aware and the timing of its jokes so precise that everything feels like a giant pillow fight. The voices and sounds in the opening theme are ridiculously adorable. The ending theme, while slower, follows the same fundamental principles of cuteness. The slapstick humor in this show, which has annoyed me in numerous other shows in the past, seems cute here for some reason. Then, Mayoi and Sakaki\u2019s mischievous moe presents a nice contrast to Tsumiki and Io\u2019s quiet moe. And Hime\u2026I don\u2019t even know\u2026she\u2019s like a personification of this show\u2019s punchline, materialized. (even the title of this show is cute! Acchi Kocchi?) \\n\\n\r\nSo, my answer to, \u201cIs it cute?\u201d would have to be, \u201cI almost got diabetes.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nDoes it have substance though? That\u2019s a much tougher question to answer. This is first and foremost a comedy rather than, say, a romance or drama, so most of its runtime is dedicated to the giant pillow fight. If I start with the assumption that the pillow fight does not create substance, then I suppose there wasn\u2019t that much substance? Yet, when the show did become a little more serious, I was pleasantly surprised by how sweetly it was handled, such that I was a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t get more of it. Nevertheless, by the end of the season, there was enough good feeling here to wake up the slice of life lover in me and warm my heart. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just for that, this review comes with a solid recommendation.\\n",

While watching, I only felt amazement and shame - my eyes are not worthy to view something so perfect, almost as if it was made for the Gods themselves.\r\nWhat makes Acchi Kocchi so great, is that, on top of the gorgeous art, unique and relaxing character designs, and orgasmic soundtrack, it has the best writing one could ever possibly imagine. Fumitoshi Oizaki makes Gen Urobuchi look like a stagnant pedant who is capable of only writing children's literature. The characters are so well written I know I could diefor Tsumiki if I knew her in real life. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement, pulling you through countless ups and downs, while also managing to be something completely innovative, original, fresh. A new idea. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways I like this show and it's really a masterpiece, if you didn't like it your opinion is probably not as good as mine\\n\\n\r\n10/10 best slice of all time",

Most of it's characters are cliche character archetypes. Now, sometimes this cast of characters can make for an interesting show, but not in this case. The main character herself is very cute, and it's rather disappointing that this series was brought down by it's cliche cast. (Though I was constantly questioning what was goingon with her hair. The ahoge was cute, but what exactly are those little things on her bangs supposed to be?)\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy throughout the series was very... Different. There may be some people who find the jokes amusing, but to most I've actually spoken to about the series (and myself), the humor gets lost. This may be due to the language barrier, I'm not sure. Maybe in Japanese the jokes actually make sense and are funny. But when translated, they just aren't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nI had high hope for this anime, with all the glowing reviews, and the absolutely adorable artwork. But what I ended up with, instead, was your run of the mill slice of life anime that tries to be funny, but who's jokes just end up very dry and boring. \\n\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, it was hard to sit through even the first episode. I'm not particularly sure how I made it through the whole series.",

            "content": "\u201cUm, m-marriage is where your life goes to drink.\u201d \r\nWhen I first saw this anime while browsing for brand new anime releases, this anime came into view. My first thoughts\u2026  Probably just one of those clich\u00e9 anime comedy romances. Well I got the comedy romance part right, but the clich\u00e9 part I couldn\u2019t have been any more wrong. Forgive me Otaku God for calling this anime clich\u00e9 *goes on hands and knees* The jokes are quite fresh and new, and the romance is so adorable your most likely going to die from potential blood loss coming out of your nose. \r\nPlot: \r\nThe plot isquite simple beyond beliefs; there is no complexity about it in anyway. Even a five year old can understand it. The anime is about the love between two high schoolers, and what fate awaits them. Well to put it simply all you\u2019re watching is Io and Tsumiki\u2019s relationship grow each and every episode, while at the same time, watching the other characters bug the heck out the both of them, mostly Tsumiki though.  Even though this anime requires no extreme thought into understanding what the fudge it\u2019s about, this anime is probably the only anime of its kind that has a perfect way of displaying plot development. Each and every episode, it shows a subtle amount of growth in a relationship from grabbing onto a coat to feeding your lover a spoonful of delicious goodness. This anime just isn\u2019t about romance though; it also does a heck of a good job of making me choke from the amount of laughter produced. Sure not every part of this anime is so funny that it\u2019s enough to make Grumpy from Snow White laugh, but hey I betcha a quarter that he would sniffle a giggle. Which means, whether you\u2019re a Happy or a Grumpy you\u2019re definitely going to laugh, giggle, snort, or even nose bleed when watching this comedy romance filled Heaven! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nSoon to be lovers, Io and Tsumiki are the ideal anime couple of 2012 with their excellent way of showing character development! Each and every episode, one way or another, shows some tiny sign of character development which is definitely one of Acchi Kocchi\u2019s proud strong points. Their budding relationship is so cute that it even puts Kamichama Karin\u2019s Kazune and Karin\u2019s adorable relationship to shambles! Now why don\u2019t we highlight the extraordinary features of these soon to be lovers? Tsumiki is not your average tsundere, unlike most tsunderes she has that cool and collective attitude that boys go crazy for, however that\u2019s not all; she has her cute side too which proves it with those kawaii cat ears that pop up now and again.  Tsumiki is also a fantastic cook, adorable singer, and a super strong woman. There\u2019s no doubt that she\u2019s the ideal woman for most men! Now last but not least let us introduce the one the only, Io Otanoshi! Io may be quite oblivious to many things, but he makes up for it with those devilish good looks and charm that the Gods and Goddesses of Anime had blessed him with. Io like Tsumiki, is also a fantastic cook, but that\u2019s not all, he\u2019s also got the skills of a ninja! He\u2019s every woman\u2019s dream man! But that\u2019s not at all, Acchi Kocchi also has Hime Haruno our nose bleeding princess, Sakaki the awesome pevert who is strangely similar to Yohei Sunohara, and Mayoi Katose the strange girl with a knack for technology. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf there is one thing I have learned from watching countless  anime shows with a variety of different and yet unique art styles, I have come to the conclusion that the art style used in an anime should somehow fit the plot and genre of the anime. For example, in a horror anime, you need a somewhat mysterious and dark feel which will cause the hearts of its viewer a feel of slight uneasiness.  In this case, however, you have a romance comedy anime with its goal being to somehow cause the hearts and souls of its viewers a feeling of relaxation, happiness, laughter, and adoration. To successfully put all these wonderful feelings together the animators had used an art style similar to that of Lucky Star\u2019s. However, that is not all; the animators had also used graphics, effects, and the hearts and souls of those who love cute things too not only woo their viewers into a zombie like state in which people will stare adoringly at their computer screen, but also a near death experience where the viewer\u2019s soul have somehow died and gone to a world of pure bliss. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the meaning of love; I just want to look at you all the time.\u201d That my anime friends are a small part of the cutesy lyrics to the anime\u2019s opening \u201cAcchi de Kocchi de.\u201d Like most openings to animes the lyrics somehow in some way relate to the anime\u2019s plot, cutesy and romantic for this one. The voice actors used in this anime are in no doubt, specialists. These seiyuus had successfully and utterly pulled down the red carpet and walked dazzlingly across it smilingly handsomely at all those other rejected seiyuus and said, \u201cTough luck kids, maybe next time.\u201d Very unbelievable if I do say so myself that a few voice actors could be as so professional as to pull off the stupidity, cuteness, embarrassment, and all those other fanciful adjectives I type randomly just to make this paragraph longer. \u201cIf I grin and nyaa, I\u2019ll know you\u2019ll scratch my back.\u201d And that was just extremely adorable lyrics to the anime\u2019s ending song \"Te wo Gyu Shite ne\u201d which is just as adorable and pleasant as Tsumiki with her cat ears which I know most people are as so tempted to pull. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nIf there is one thing I wanted to do after watching episode one of this anime, it was to dance around in my underwear like a strange lunatic while smiling and listening to anime music. If you are wondering if I have problems than yes, yes I do. But that does not change the fact that this anime is so wonderful that every Otaku will get up and scream of joy, while watching Tsumiki go moe on them! I also got into the strange habit of saying cat like things; I have the strange urge to do so. But yes if you want me to get right into the point than yes, yes I 100% did enjoy watching this anime, so much that I want to dance happily in my own little world where my crush will someday pat me in the head lovingly and feed me a spoonful of food. My gosh, I\u2019m sure every girl wants their crush to do that to them! Don\u2019t worry ladies, I\u2019m sure someday your prince will come.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Normally someone wouldn't even bother to look at an anime that admits to have cliched characters in its synopsis. Nowadays, I normally wouldn't even touch an anime that looks like it could turn into a harem. However, the cover of Acchi Kocchi just attracted my attention so much that I just couldn't resist its cuteness. No one can. Thus, I started to watch the first episode, having low expectation and knowing it could turn into a horrible school harem. Upon finishing the first episode however, I found myself an easy-going little comedy gem.\r\nThe plot usually starts off with the main male character Io meeting upwith his female friend, Tsumiki, who waits for him in different, but seemingly familiar settings. They then walk together somewhere, meeting up with friends on the way while committing some mischief throughout the episode. However, what's different about this series than most school dramas is that the setting changes I would say consistently, which makes it more interesting to watch. Also, the characters may be archetypes, but they're hilarious.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTsumiki is perhaps the coolest main character ever; she can beat guys at video games, has a feminine side, and \u00a0cat ears. Tsumiki definitely reminds me of lucky star as well as Toradora, she almost seems like shy version of Taiga with cat ears. Then there's Io, who I'm not going to go into details about since there's not much known about him, but he's definitely a very kind person and Tsumiki obviously likes him.\u00a0Thus, a compassionate romance is bound to happen, but a fatuous relationship isn't out of question either.\\n\\n\r\nAll the side characters are archetypes: the Pervy male sidekick, \"single\" teacher, air headed females, nose-bleeding characters, etc. But wait, all of them in a single series? Yep, all the archetypes are included in one single series. So now you can have deja vu about almost every cliched characters every time you watch this series! But don't get me wrong, instead of being annoying, I'd say most of the side characters are pretty funny. If taken out of contexts, their actions just seem like a bunch of teenagers' rebellious acts, but within the context, it's almost like a well-scripted stand up comedy show.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art was definitely cute and that's all there really is to say about it. It's got beautiful designs, and the characters all have something special about them. What more could you ask for in a comedy series like this one? And like I said before some of the characters looked really similar to those in lucky star, so if you liked lucky star, do look into this series. Also, good thing there was music in the series and that it flowed pretty well with the fluent voice acting. Nothing too lyrically genius, but definitely soothing background music.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, with all these elements combined together, this show illustrates a great comedy anime. The characters were so entertaining that one may find themselves in a dazzling entrancement. If you watch this show while looking for a serious drama of some sort, then you'll be disappointed. If you watch this series open-minded while looking for perhaps a lighthearted school drama, you'd be impressed at the results. Acchi kocchi definitely appealed to its audience throughout this series and is a lofty example of how relaxing a comedy series could be.",

            "content": "I usually see myself as a laid-back person more than anything. Because of that, the genre-less genre of \"slice of life\" appealed to me. With that eager and naive mindset, I dove head first into the world of...well...ordinary life. I first began with '\"Lucky Star\", but the overwhelming amount of references was beyond my knowledge. I then tried \"Nichijou\", but despite it's charm, I didn't feel that \"love at first sight\" spark. With that being my interpretation of this genre, I casually shied away.\r\nSomewhere down the line, I found \"Acchi Kocchi\". I was somewhat reluctant due to my earlier experiences, but something about the coverimage enticed me into at least giving it a shot. I've had pleasant experiences with romance tags, and this anime happened to have one also. \"Just do it.\" as Nike would say.\\n\r\nAnd so I did. Somehow, I feel so undeserving to have enjoyed this anime because of my earlier doubts.\\n\r\nThis anime made me question why \"Clannad\" or \"Chuu2byou\", albeit being quite enjoyable, had the slice of life tag. I mean, drama hidden or masked underneath a supposed regular life is still in essence a drama, right? Enter, \"Acchi Kocchi\". Absolutely no dramatic overhaul, yet still somehow a precious gem.\\n\r\nAllow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Content - 8\\n\r\nAh, I don't know. \"Story\" seems like an unfair way to rank this anime, given it's not really the goal here. There's no drama or intense feeling for the characters. Plot twists are quite simply non-existent. However, it's completely made up for (perhaps even more so) with what the creators have given us instead. It's about a group of five high school friends (With one potential unrequited lover) going about their everyday lives. Of course, there are certain out-of-the-ordinary mishaps to make it interesting, but I don't believe that's what makes it stand out to me. What I really found interesting was the way the creators make out-of-the-ordinary ordinary (Read that over a couple times), in a way that I don't believe I've seen before. Basically, all the out of the strangeness is in the heads of the cast. Thinking and imagining is normal, right? Virtually all the blasphemy happens in the character's heads. The animators have so graciously animated their wild imaginations. Needless to say, HILARIOUS! The complete randomness and extravagance of their thoughts always left me crying of laughter. Most, if not all the jokes are fresh, and not reused very often other than I do realise this may fit under the \"characters\" section of my review, but alas, I felt as though the character's thoughts ARE the plot, and should be mentioned as so.The episodes are split into two ten minute segments highlighting a certain event of their lives. I can't say they're really quite linear even with slight references back to previous episodes, meaning you could start anywhere and still appreciate it. Some might be depreciative of the lack of originality in creating the story, so I'd give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for bright and colourful. The cute art style is part of what led me to watch this anime to begin with. I have to say, it's quite interesting and fresh. The overall tone is bright and colourful. Simple character designs perfectly suit character personalities. Scenery and such are usually brighter colours than they should be, and sometimes backgrounds are filled with bubbly patterns. I really want to mention the transition scenes though. Usually they're just simple movement animation over a single coloured background, but it's quite appealing. You'd have to see for yourself. Obviously, the art doesn't aim for realism. It aims to create and support a cheerful, relaxing atmosphere, and does that outstandingly. Animation isn't astounding, but rather doesn't stand out. Really, the art is just a pleasure to look at. Though, I guess it doesn't appeal to everyone, so I'll bump it down to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are rather cute and catchy, though I must admit, I didn't really listen to them often. They do gain points for being in perfect correlation with the mood of the anime though. Perhaps it's not meant to be a needle in your heart that stays with you forever, but a relaxing, overly cheerful, pop tune. The bells and whistles (literally) during the transition scenes are very suiting, and emphasize certain things as they should. Voices perfectly suit their characters, making the atmosphere all the more real. Tsumiki's quiet, shy voice and Io's cool, sexy voice are things I'll never forget. I can't say I can really distinguish any of the OSTs from the anime, but they blend well. In a nutshell, all the sounds build perfectly towards the atmosphere, but aren't much standalone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nA very colourful cast we have here (Literally and figuratively). As mentioned before, these characters ARE the plot. Their wild imaginations and attitudes is what makes this show a show. I can't say that they have original personalities, but I can confidently say that their personalities are a new spin on an ageing old. Basically, take some of the most generic character personalities, and make them a little more relaxed and normal. BAM! You've just created the characters of this show. All characters are interesting, yet normal enough to even be your classmates in real life. Their flaws and strengths are fleshed out to the point that you really love and cherish the characters, yet mysterious enough for unexpectedness. All characters really compliment each other, as a group of friends should.  More importantly, they're very entertaining together.\\n\r\nIo - The dense lady charmer.\\n\r\nTsumiki - The short, tsundere cat-like girl in love with Io.\\n\r\nHime - The cute, friendly klutz.\\n\r\nSakaki - Laid-back prankster.\\n\r\nMayoi - Technologically smart prankster.\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is quite amazing too. Heck, they're personalities are deep enough to make them main characters if they were given more screen time. All the characters work together well while at the same time each having their own unique charm; as friends should. Do I really need to say more? IT'S A BIG GROUP OF FRIENDS! (9 because they're not as original as some might hope)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOne of my favourites; period. I'll never forget it. I love it more than I can even express in words. When I'm bored, I go back and pick a random episode to re-watch and enjoy all over again. I'd recommend it to anyone and express my utter love for it if anyone would listen to boring-ol'-me.  If you're looking to jump into the slice of life genre, or even in you're not for that matter, watch \"Acchi Kocchi\". You don't need to be an otaku and know a ton of references to fully enjoy it. You don't even need to think to enjoy it. Just relax and let this anime take you Place to Place.",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi, the anime adaptation from yonkoma manga (4 cell/panel manga) that begin aired around 2012. Several words that came up to describe it are funny, cute and adorable! How the story goes that sometimes make me laugh out loud because of its joke in it, all those cute, adorable and memorable character are the reason that Acchi Kocchi is worth to watch for all of you who really enjoy gag anime and a little bit of daily life romance in school. Although, there are several reasons for me why I give it fair. Specifically, I will explain it below:\r\n(*) Story\r\nHow the story told inprocess consist of two part in one episode, there's Part A and Part B. Most of it linked to one another, but there's several episode was not. The story itself is simple like most love stories, there's a girl who falls in love with a guy though their personality is cross apart but somehow they could make romance situation filled with sweetness aura. I don't know how to describe it specifically, but besides the simple and mainstream story, it surely gives us an expression of moe that makes the audience feel relax and enjoy the story. The other points, the romance itself has a small percentage compared to its joke or comedy. For the ending, I would like to say that it's not certainly enough to me for say that is a good ending, but I would not say that is a bad ending either. For all, I would say that is fair enough and could interest to watch for the very beginning till the end of the episode.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Art\\n\r\nThe art is good enough. It's from gag manga, after all, the creator may need it to expand their story and character as flexible it can to make the audience not bored and enjoy. Though, those efforts don't work on several condition. But, it is memorable and fit the story. I'd like to say that it's cute art.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Sound\\n\r\nI love the seiyuu, the OP and ED theme and a little touch of back sound that give us a fit sense to watch this anime. The character voice of Rumi Okubo fits Tsumiki well, same as Nobuhiko Okamoto who fits Io too. I just love them all! And somehow I liked Kyouya voice too, it's cool rather than the others. The opening and ending are good and fit the story. It's a good job for this point!\\n\\n\r\n(*) Character\\n\r\nThe character is memorable enough. Tsumiki the tsundere girl, Io the cool guy, Mayoi, and Sakaki are the duos who enjoy teasing and make pranks and last but not least is the innocent adorable character, Hime-chan. The characters don't have any specific development till the end of the stories. But it well received for this anime because of the storyline and for the fact, the characters from the story itself that the reason this anime is different than others. It\u2019s unique and everyone want to adore them. Like Tsumiki and Hime for example, I want to pinch and own them if they really exist!! That kind of expression that makes Acchi Kocchi is memorable with its cuteness.\\n\\n\r\n(*) Enjoyment\\n\r\nI got bored while I watched it, maybe because of the same story concept that appears in several times, but despite it, I watched Acchi Kocchi till the very end. It because somehow I like the characters that available in the story and the soundtrack that make me want to singing it with copying Io and Tsumiki voice till I got tired myself. In conclusion, it could somehow make me want to watch it more and it fair enough to watch for all of you who like that kind of genre with a little unique, cuteness and moe characters.\\n",

IT'S TOO CUTE ;3 \r\nThis anime really makes me wonder sometimes, why isn't life more happy? ;3\r\nReality seems more stressful, but I guess this is why cute slice of life shows the happy part of our lives ;D\r\nStory (8): There's not much of a story as it's basically a cute slice of life, sort of like Lucky Star. The main characters have a little love story going on and random things happen, that can make you laugh or drown in how 'kawaii'this anime is ;3\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (10): I love the animation, it is very well done and it has CUTENESS drawn all over it. Sound also amazing, love the voice actors and the sound effects ;D\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9): We got a variety of characters with unique personalities. Main guy character is very formal, you can say he has a dry-humor. His guy friend reminds me of a Sunahara from Clannad XD The main girl Tsumiki is soooooooooooooooooooooo cute, cat ears ftw. Then we got a jokester and a girl that is exactly like Rena from Higurashi (Just that she's not a yandere).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall (10): I think this anime first episode deserves more than just a 7.6 rating, probably a high 8, that's what I would give it. Very enjoyable if you like slice of life and cute things, I see it as potentially better than Lucky Star and other slice of life animes.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Given the intro, graphics and such, I just figured this was another carbon copy of 'Kill Me Baby', and while many of the setups and gags were in the same vein, at least here there was a thread to follow, thin, but still a thread.\r\nI think people who watch this can be easily divided into two groups: those who scrunch up their eyebrows and say 'what?' when Mayoi is on the loudspeaker asking people to look to their right, then telling them \"there is a wall\", and then those who hear that line  and have to hit pause because they're laughing so hard.\r\nI enjoyedthe fact that the storyline didn't try to force the relationship between Io and Tsumiki.  Heck, they're comfortable, and high school is a hassle as it is, but I never expected a kiss or hug at the end.  It was good friends helping each other through their trials and tribulations, many of which were self-administered...\\n\\n\r\nMy ideal ending (I was disappointed in the anime finale) would have been to follow up on the end of episode 11, where Io feels a blush as he thinks of Tsumiki and might be realizing he has more than friendly feelings for her.  I thought they had it nailed after Part A for valentines, but in Part B, when Tsumiki thanked him for the cat treat he made just for her, I'd have shown him holding out his hand and saying something like \"Any time. Let's go home', and after a frozen second for Tsumiki, she takes his hand and they walk away from the camera toward the station.  That not only takes the relationship one small step forward, it closes the loop from the first episode when Tsumiki is trying to catch up to Io and is trying to grab his coat/arm just as Mayoi shows up.\\n\\n\r\nI can't see a second season, but I enjoyed having them as friends.",

            "content": "Honestly, i am not the type who can enjoy an anime which doesnt have any strong plot or using an \"cute\" character like Azumanga Daioh or Lucky star. But for this one its exceptional.\r\nWhy?\r\nFrom the start i am watching this anime i have a mix feelings from \"WTF\" into \"SMM (So Much Moeness)\". I dont really understand a bit about this one but along with a few episodes finally i got hooked...no, not hooked. but GOT IN LOVE with this one.\r\nAcchi Kocchi or Place to Place in english is a typical slice of life anime with comedy and some romance on it. The story isabout.... no, i will said. \\n\\n\r\n\"Have you ever feel being teased by your friends because you got crush on somebody?\"\\n\r\n\"Did you feel annoyed by being teased or maybe happy because of it?\"\\n\\n\r\nThat question was enough to describe on what this anime is about. Summary, this anime was about Tsumiki who loves Io but she cant express it in front of him. So, her friends\" helping\" her with teasing her and Io so she can honest to herself. \\n\\n\r\nIn this 12 episodes, you will see many funny moments and romantic feeling that makes you saying \"aaaawwww... thats cute\". I am kinda surprised about this anime since my first assumption is this anime will full of pushed unfunny jokes and a bland romance. But i am wrong, this anime was full of romantic, funny, cute, amusing, entertaining, adorable, kawaiii, and *insert any good feelings on it* moments. In short, this anime was like Lucky Star or Nichijou + Romance and so we have Acchi Kocchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on this anime was top notch, i say it in \"unique\" way not in \"epic\" way.  What i mean with unique is in Acchi Kocchi they always have a summary in every scenes to explain what happen in that scene (see it for yourself, since its kinda hard to describe it). Because this anime was full with funny and cute moments, the art is supporting it with colorful and bright background and of course, cute design.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character we have in Acchi Kocchi is a circle of friends that consists of five person. Io, Tsumiki, Hime, Mayoi, and Sakaki.\\n\r\n- Io is the main character in this anime, he is someone that is senseless if its about love. Even his friends teasing him with Tsumiki, he still doesnt realize it.\\n\r\n- Tsumiki is your adorable main character. She have a crush on Io, but she is too shy to express it and so, she is being teased by her friends.\\n\r\n- Mayoi is your annoying character or friends, she is partner-in-crime with Sakaki in teasing Io and Tsumiki. She loves to teasing between these two. (everyone is definitely have a friend like this, LOL)\\n\r\n- Hime is your shy character. What is memorable for her is her bloody nose in every romantic scenes.\\n\r\n- Sakaki is like Mayoi, your annoying friends that love to tease people. In this case, is Io and Sakaki. but without him, i am sure it will not exciting.\\n\\n\r\nWith that mini description on each character, i am sure you will have imagine on how \"exciting\" this anime was. Yes, it was like in our life. We have always annoying friends but without him/her, it will be quiet and not exciting.\\n\\n\r\nSummary, this anime was an excellent choice if you want to have an enjoyable show. Its funny, heartwarming, and adorable show. Maybe some of you will doubt watching this anime because of the art. But believe me, sometimes crossing the lines or trying something new is not bad as you think (like myself).",

This is most likely due to the lack of comedic and romance I value in most anime. \r\n-Story-\r\nThat being said Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place) hit home when I first started watching this. There isn't really a story per say, but there is character development within certain relationships that you can follow along. Every episode is as enjoyable as the last, Including the special.\r\n-Art-\r\nThe art is perfect for me. It's my kindof art. Its bright, cute, and certain aspects of the anime bring things to life. They put a lot of detail into the pen spinning and many other things.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nI usually don't give sound a high rating unless it's deserved. The opening and ending theme of Acchi Kocchi is beyond good. The cast was perfect for each character. Everything was brought to life in a great way. I wouldn't change a thing.\\n\\n\r\n-Character-\\n\r\nEvery character is unique and developed with certain qualities that make you love them all. There isn't a character i find annoying enough to hate.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nThe romance and comedy is what takes the cake. Everything is cute, funny, and exciting. I look forward to hoping a second season comes around. Overall I give this a high re-watch rating.",

Or maybe i should say \"while constantly watching the progress bar waiting for it to end\".\r\nStory/Character: 4\r\nObviously the story isn't original at all, the summary itself makes you think of \"stereotype\", but i hoped in some parody of the characters, which is what they usually do with such blatant stereotypes. Nope.\r\nArt: 7\r\nIt's the best part of the anime, but it'snot that good either. Just \"cute\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI usually don't pay much attention to OSTs, so i can only say that OP is decent and ED is bad. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThis is where the anime fails. It's absolutely boring. I know this isn't a comedy anime, but its structure is sketch-like, so the result is... a comedy anime that isn't funny. One of the worst types of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nMaybe i should have seen where this was going from the art/summary. I wathched Lucky Star before, and someone said this was similar. For the record, i dropped Lucky Star at half series because it was a little boring. But at least there were funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nWell, i suggest not watching this, but since this has a high rating and i see a lot of people who like this just because \"it's cute\", maybe it could satisfy those kind of watchers. it surely didn't satisfy me.",

            "content": "Worst anime I have seen in my life. 12 episodes was too much to endure for a show with so little meaning and purpose behind it. Those 288 minutes I wasted I would like repaid to me in brain cells I lost while suffering behind my computer screen in agony. Here is my review of Acchi Kocchi:\r\nPresentation: On the surface, Acchi Kocchi has a bright, chibi quirk about it that lured me in from pictures online. It LOOKS fun, bouncy, and promising from a distance but this show affirms the notion you should NEVER judge a book by the cover.\r\nStory: There is none. None whatsoever.The premise of Acchi Kocchi is that of a tsundere, cat-child hybrid who episode after episode fails to confess her lingering feelings for the object of her affections. Each episode is basically a gag reel of how main characters Tsumiki, Mayoi, Hime, Sakaki, and Io experience daily life in and out of school. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I have never met a cast so atrocious since Infinite Stratos and Love Hina. With FIVE characters at the shows disposal to develop and experiment with, they instead decided to mold each one of them to a cheap and bland Japanese stereotype. Tsumiki is the female tsundere, Io the cool charmer, Sakaki the class clown, Mayoi the instigator, and Hime the self conscious and shy girl. The stereotypes would almost be fine in MODERATION but what Acchi Kocchi does is EXAGGERATE each characters personalities (if you can even call them that) and takes them to the farthest extreme possible. The show by itself is already miserable enough, but when the lack of story and plot progression is compounded by weak and bland characters, it's insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Decent at best but mediocre if I'm being honest. The colors are bright but the character designs look like carbon cutouts from any other anime of this awful genre. Even close ups aren't spectacular which other anime typically capitalize on the most to show off the quality of the art style. The backgrounds are forgettable and even scenes which are supposed to be beautiful don't strike any real impression. The art is just as bland and soulless as the characters.\\n\\n\r\nVoices: This was almost the worst part. In conjunction with their awful personalities, the characters' VOICES detracted from any enjoyment I could possibly draw from Acchi Kocchi. Tsumiki, the neko-tsundere hybrid, had one of the most annoying and ridiculous voices I have ever heard, and this was in the Japanese version. Her voice, quiet and CONSTANTLY mumbling, managed to make itself EVEN WORSE by the \"Nya~\"s she screamed every other frame. Mayoi's voice was NO BETTER in that by trying to sound so cute (to masquerade the ill-intent of her character) made me resent her more than anyone else in the pitiful program. Sakaki sounded like a bad version of Sunohara from Clannad and Io's voice actor had to put forth such little effort to produce his voice it was barely noticeable and unmemorable. Hime WOULD HAVE had a normal voice if the actress weren't trying so hard to portray her as a overbearingly weak and sensitive baby girl.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: This show tried so hard to be funny and that is ultimately what killed it. With every second a girls' nose exploding, it was almost as if they were experiencing their period busting out of their heads. Mayoi's antics were not entertaining nor were they cute. Had she performed one of her infamous gags and died in a terrible accident, THAT would have been more comedic than ANYTHING else this buttstain of a \"comedy\" tried to do. Sakaki was no better. His only point of interest was the neglect and abuse he received from characters around him who, to be quite honest, deserved to be subjected to the same cruel and unusual punishment as him. This show was not funny and the harder it tried to be, the more painful it became to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This show is a piece of shit. It's garbage. Maybe my problem is I came in looking for plot, story, character development, complex interpersonal relationships, and perplexing things of the like. I came for something that would challenge me, but even judging by the surface I shouldn't have expected that. This was a huge waste of my gotdamn time and I almost regret it. I'd pray for this memory to be erased from my mind but I don't even want the possibility of me trying to watch this show again in another life. \\n\\n\r\nDo not watch this anime if you value yourself at all. ANY anime is better than this rubbish.",

It's very clean and there were no problems with the animation and the little cat ears on Tsumiki were very adorable andmade me giggle every time I saw them (yes I said giggle and no I'm not a little girl!).\\n\\n\r\n(7)Sound:\\n\r\nI usually don't listen to the OP or the ED of a show but this one had a very very catch and amusing OP with a very calm and soothing ending which were both very enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\n(10)Character:\\n\r\nCharacters are what's going to make this show and they certainly make it good. Each character has an amazing personalty that works with the group and made each moment of this first episode very easy and exciting to watch. I especially enjoy Tsumiki's shy/tsundere but at moments very daring.\\n\\n\r\n(10)Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIt is only the first episode but I must say, it has a very very enjoyable show. It had its laughable moments, it's cute moments and it's devious moments and I'm sure it'll continue through the whole season.\\n\\n\r\n(10)Overall:\\n\r\nOverall I just had to give this show a 10 and I think just watching one episode of this you could agree it's going to be one of those animes where you do look forward to it every week and sad when it's gone.",

            "content": "On the surface, Acchi Kocchi looks like your typical high school slice of life rom-com filled with overused cliches such as school festivals, beach excursions, valentines day drama, and the like. While that is an accurate description of the general concept of this show, it excelled at making me laugh through unconventional and random humor, and making me smile at the sweet and tender moments the show sets up. With a cast of adorable (albeit cliche; we have the clueless male lead, the tsundere female lead, the airheaded and innocent girl, and the over-the-top troublemakers) characters, comedy that is more than often met with alaugh or chuckle, and some innocent and sweet romance, Acchi Kocchi sticks to the conventions of the genre and brings us something relaxing and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBased off a 4-panel manga, Acchi Kocchi follows the slightly unusual lives of Otonashi Io, a quiet and reserved guy who is for the most part clueless about many things, Tsumiki Miniwa, a shy and short girl who has trouble expressing her true feelings about a certain someone, Haruno Hime, a bubbly and innocent little airheaded girl who gets excited over the budding romance between her friends, Katase Mayoi, a electronics wizard who has a knack for coming up with schemes that often leave her friends annoyed and unamused, and Inui Sakaki, Mayoi's male counterpart in crime, and rounds out our group as the hot-headed center of harassment and jokes. We follow this group of friends as they do homework, attend festivals, go to the beach, make chocolate for valentine's day, and a myriad of other activities typical high school students do.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is best described by the title, in that it really is all over the place. For anyone who has watched their fair share of high school slice of life comedies, Acchi Kocchi does come up with some hilarious original content, and most of the punchlines hit the mark while a rarer few disappoint. From watching the rest of the group fawn over Tsumiki's affections towards a nonchalant Io to seeing Sakaki receive the brunt of a bad situation, I found it hard to wipe the grin off my face while watching the show. The romance, on the other hand, is slow and mellow. The show takes the time to set up really nice moments between Io and Tsumiki, and are more often than not adorable and sweet. For any fans of romance, the romance presented in this show is easy on the eyes and heart.\\n\\n\r\nMoe is a controversial issue within the anime community; some absolutely love it while others will hate it with every fiber of their being. While Acchi Kocchi does contain a good deal of moe, it didn't diminish the quality of the comedy or the romance in any way. In fact, in most occasions, it made a bit all the more funny or a tender moment all the more sweet. Even if you're not a fan of it, Acchi Kocchi has something for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is cute and lively, and the characters are reminiscent of Nichijou's. It is somewhat childish, but is expected for a show of this genre. The animation is fluid and easy on the eyes, and parts like Mayoi doing some crazy stunt are well animated. The sound is bright and lighthearted, and will have you humming the OP even after the show is over. \\n\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi is one of those \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" series. While it may seem like a cliche moe-blob with little to no substance, it may just catch you a little off guard, and hopefully make you laugh and smile.\\n",

            "content": "When I was young, I have always enjoyed those Looney Tunes cartoons and the Disney shorts. Acchi Kocchi is one of those anime where I can go to my dentist's office and watch that without having any fear. Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true colors of moe and comedy combined.\r\nYou may think Acchi Kocchi is another rom-com anime with an indecisive main character with no attraction, but you are absolutely wrong. While watching Acchi Kocchi, it gave me a heartwarming feeling. Acchi Kocchi focuses on a maiden in love, Tsumiki Miniwa, trying to find her way into Io Otonashi's heart. You can saythat there are those lovey-dovey events, yet there are hilarious examples Tsumiki tries to approach Io. You can say the most famous romance line, \"Anata.. wa .. wa-ta-shi ~ *wink*.\" was used and it even made me baffle in love. Even though it was overused, Acchi Kocchi was able to show the true meaning of \"Do you want me\" as a good romance line. The best part was that the scene has a comedic approach that it made me cry of laughter. A good example is: Do you know that character who cock blocks? Yeah, that character's in there. I don't hate that character in Acchi Kocchi, but I would definitely hate it in real life. It is hilarious to see what Tsumiki has to face in order to achieve Io's heart. Lastly, the episodes are kept organized and neat which makes me love it. I would definitely want to see another anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unique. The anime has a moe-style which you can say that the characters look very cute and chibi. The colors are simple and the animations are great. I love simple art colors and it reminds me much of OreShura's art coloring. Animes similar to Acchi Kocchi would definitely be Lucky\u2606Star and Nichijou. If you have seen either one of them, you should definitely pick up this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. This anime focuses on moe so most of the sounds are cute. The opening is well made and the audio is cute. The ending is what got me the most. It was sung by Tsumiki (I honestly think the voice actress did a great job) and the voice actress is Ookubo, Rumi. She was the voice actress of Yoshikawa, Chinatsu in Yuri Yuri. Listening to the ending was cute and soothing. It isn't like those fast paced audio, but a good slow paced with a good beat/tone.\\n\\n\r\nWell, time to wrap up this review. It is sad that we have to depart, but I will be writing more reviews time by time. The enjoyment is very good. I was able to glue my butt onto my chair and not multi task while watching this anime. Most of people would probably text or browse forums or etc, but I had that on hold till I finished this anime. I even had pause watching the on-going anime to finish Acchi Kocchi. If you enjoy moe, romance and comedy, Acchi Kocchi is definitely for you. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who haven't seen this anime, but read my review, I have a preview for you to get you interested! Fear not, there are no spoilers and will never be in my review.\\n\r\n---   http://imgur.com/a/sXy1c\\n",

            "content": "If you want to see an anime where moe caricatures crash into each other, trip on banana peels and produce nosebleeds capable of filling up an olympic-sized swimming pool with blood every single episode then you have found your anime. If however you're looking for a more meaningful comedy then by all means skip this one out as you won't miss out on much. \r\nI have to admit I had high expectations for this anime after skimming through all the reviews and forum posts praising Acchi Kocchi's comedic wit and entertainment value. And while initially the show did manage to make me smile and chuckleon occasion during the first 2 episodes, that quickly turned into boredom and disappointment. Why? There's an easy explanation:\\n\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi has no real story to speak of. It's fully episodic nature and complete devotion to a slice-of-life theme means that it basically replays the same premise and setting every single episode. Now that in itself wouldn't be bad (basic sitcom formula) but this anime also replays the same jokes over and over again as well. Mayoi (one of the girls in the cast) trips on a banana peel, Mayoi trips on ice, Mayoi trips on a puddle of water. Now apply that to every other character and by the end of the series you'll be bored enough to actually try to lick your own elbow. \\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is no different. The two most common expressions you'll hear the most every single episode in roughly 15-20 second intervals are \"kawaii\" or \"kawaii desu\". Once the initial premise is established the dialogue is recycled more furiously than plastic in Germany. It basically comes down to this - girls compliment male lead. Male lead compliments them back. They nosebleed. That's pretty much it. Something like this CAN be funny but not for the entire duration of a full 12 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nSecondary male characters appeared to be the only hope later on but unfortunately they shared the same fate as the rest of the cast, only adding more fuel to this burning wreck of an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe only truly positive aspects of Acchi Kocchi would be the quality of animation and the fairly decent OST. While the style itself was not something I enjoyed (huge Moe overdose), the anime was done decently. The only issue with art I have would be that every other living organism apart from cats and our cast is a greyed out stationary statue. Either the studio was lazy or they decided to go with it as a \"stylistic\" choice but I didn't like it. It just made the anime as a whole look a bit cheap. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment you'll get from Acchi Kocchi will only be from the first 2-3 episodes. After that the story, characters, jokes and dialogue go into loop mode and you will not miss anything if you try to drop it after that point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was in fact a poor experience. The studio basically created a 3 episode OVA and stretched it out far beyond its entertainment value. \\n\\n\r\n4 points.",

            "content": "Normally, I am not the type of person that can sit through a slice of life anime like this with no real story (like lucky star). However this one caught my attention one day and I was gladly surprised to find that it was not that bad of a show.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe plot is very simple, its just about High-schoolers that are in love. If you are going into this anime expecting to find an amazing and deep plot, then you are going to be dissapointed. Story is the weakest part of this anime,  in fact it  does not have much of a storyto speak of. This is not necessarily a deal breaker because what it lacks story wise, it makes up for in other sections. Most of the \"plot\" consist of the main group of friends in different situations. If you just want an anime to watch that is not really demanding and is just fun, then it should not be that much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi's art is very simple and colorful. It resembles the art of Lucky Star a lot and it at 1st, may turn you off of  because it looks childish. Originally I didn't watch this anime because of the art, I saw 1 picture and immediately tossed it aside. However, when I actually sat down and watched it I sort of became accustomed to it. The one thing about the art that must be said is that it really complements the anime. It fits the laid back themes of romance and comedy rather well. Also, Miniwa is adorable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound track of the show, while not necessarily bad, didn't stand out to much. Aside form the really addictive and upbeat opening theme, there is no one, stand out track. The music fits when it is played and does its job well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is were this anime (like many slice of life anime) shines. It really relies on the interactions between the characters to drive the show. The relationship between the the main 2 characters is not really new, however it is done really well. The main heroin Miniwa, is a well done character, that is in love with the main lead, but is to afraid to tell him about her feelings. Unlike most tsunderes that are normally cold towards their lovers, Miniwa just gets really shy, this is the main reason she is adorable (that and the cat ears). The main protagonist of the show Io is the extremely dense, and that cannot see that Miniwa has obvious feelings for him. In each episode they get closer to each other and it was fun to see them gradually come together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime really has made me expand my anime roster and not turn down anime at 1st glance. I fell in love with the main characters and after every episode wanted to immediately watch the next one to see them get closer.\\n\r\nI came out of this show with a smile on my face. The music and art really fit the romance and cuteness of the show and I am glad that I got around to watching this anime. It is definitely worth you're time if you like this kind of show, and I would encourage everyone to just give it a shot if you just want to sit and relax and watch a fun, simple show. While is does not set any records for originality, it does what is set out to do really well.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my 1st review, Hope that it's not THAT horrible :3\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi: This Anime's Story Was All Over The Place!\r\nOkay, I know. REALLY bad pun. I just had to get it out before getting into this review.\r\nAcchi Kocchi is one of those series that I found to be just magical in its presentation. There is no \"Madoka Magica\" surprises with the cute animation though. What you see is what you get, a bunch of cutely animated HS characters doing hilariously cute things. The \"story\" revolves around a group of five high school friends participating in hilarious everyday activities, from making odd Valentine's Day chocolates for each other, to scaring each other with a bear suitand a creepily made paper bag mask. Acchi Kocchi really is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get when it comes to the random acts of comedy thrown your way.\\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be the strongest aspect of this series, with the lead character essentially being a small, quiet catlike tsundere named Tsumiki. She has a strong attraction for the stoic, yet unobservant Io, a boy who's quietly romantic demeanor makes him a heartthrob for all the girls in their group. The other three members of made up of Hime, a clumsy, whimsical girl who's shyness shines when it comes to attractions of the opposite sex, Sakaki, the other boy in the group who's fantasies are less than desired by the rest of the group (and usually ends up in some sort of painful experience), and finally Yayoi, an ambitiously creative lab coat-wearing girl whose ideas usually cause trouble for the rest of the group. When I was first introduced to the members of this group, I was hesitant how this series would work, but I was amazed at the chemistry the characters shared with each other. What I absolutely loved about it was how the characters knew each other so well, they'd say and do things to try and help each other out, primarily speaking, the obvious feelings that Io and Tsumiki have for each other but neither has the courage to say. Watching Io and Tsumiki work off each other was downright adorable and the three other characters interactions added the comedy element that this anime had no shortage of.\\n\\n\r\nI found another strength of this series was just sound in general. The voice acting, the music, and even the solo performance instrumentals and sound effects running in the background made this series shine. It was able to match the tone the animation and story was setting to a T. When something quirky was happening, you could hear a solo xylophone player playing a mischievous tune. When something endearing was happening, you could hear a solo acoustic guitar player playing a heartfelt tune. It was the small nuances during the show that made the series feel heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation was simplistic and far from what we'd call \"great\", where it made up in that department was creativity. I absolutely loved the arrow themed title cards that would pop up between scenes that would hilariously map out the previous scene, or the small additions of random props that matched the joyful theme of the series, like cat ears on the curiously quiet Tsumiki.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the anime fell short was really in the story and the character development. The story is extremely non-progressive with the characters' development (or lack there of). There isn't exactly a \"story\" that these characters are really involved in. The \"story\" of this series is just the random things these five high schoolers are doing. The character development was severely lacking because all we learn about the characters is their personalities. We don't see any of their back stories, such as how these characters met or what caused them to have their extremely unique personalities. There's no \"progression\" in the story. In fact, you could watch this series COMPLETELY out of order and you would not miss any important plot points. The ONLY plot point that might be noticed if watched out of order were the two Valentine's Day episodes. Considering the sort of relationship Io and Tsumiki had with each other, it's one of those series where you're rooting for something to happen, although if you're wishing, you'll be left somewhat disappointed. Although, I will admit the buildup between Io and Tsumiki over the last two episodes appeared to be building a strong foundation for a romantic climax. I just thought it fell a little flat. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way I can describe Acchi Kocchi is it's a great series to watch if you're just looking for a simple comedy series where you can just shut the brain off and just enjoy some hilarious sketch bits. It's an endearing show that leaves you with no angst or qualms about the characters or story. It's just a simple series that's good for a pick-me-up if you're feeling down. I know I was feeling a little depressed going into this series and it managed to bring a smile to my face as I watched. It's extremely similar to Lucky Star in it's simplistically animated comedy styling while the scriptwriting is comparable to a quirky series like Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou. Like I said earlier, if you go into this expecting a Madoka Magica-like twist, you're watching the wrong series. If you go into this judging solely by the \"book by the cover\" analogy, you're getting exactly what you bargained for.",

And look at the top of her head; even though she\u2019s a normal human, the show puts cat ears on her all the time without any explanation, just to boost her moe points. Truly terrifying. Not to mention she\u2019s shy but tries to show her feelings. Moe. Soft-spoken and thoughtful. Moe. Super short buthas a huge weird hair curl thing. Moe. And, of course, she\u2019s got a little girl crush on our male main character, Io Otonashi. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe. Moe.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Io, if it\u2019s even remotely tenable to describe a male character as moe, then I would have to assert that Io is moe to the max. He\u2019s tall, smart, soft-spoken like Tsumiki, and is very self-reliant in a way that reminded me of Ryuuji from Toradora. Plus, despite seeming rather oblivious to Tsumiki\u2019s adoration, he doesn\u2019t actually get fazed much by girls at all. He\u2019s not afraid of physical contact, and when he wants to, he can perform embarrassing romantic lines with enough smoothness to give girls nosebleeds (e.g. the light from these fireworks pales in comparison to the light I see when I gaze into your eyes). This becomes a reoccurring joke too, which somehow never gets too old. \\n\\n\r\nNow, usually, it turns me off when I see nosebleeds used as a joke in comedies, such as in Yuru Yuri. Aside from the obvious fact that people don\u2019t generally get nosebleeds from sexual arousal, it just never appealed to me aesthetically. However, in this case, it was okay, and I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe it was because the way it was animated here looks so childish that my unconscious aversion to the blood was not even triggered. \\n\\n\r\nAnother pet peeve of mine is when a male character is so dense that it becomes an impenetrable wall against character and plot development. Even though Io sort of fits this bill at times, yet again, the show manages to win me over. In this case, their friends, particularly Mayoi, alleviates all possible frustration by being acutely aware of what\u2019s happening and pushing the pair at each with well-intentioned (or maybe not so well-intentioned) teasing (or just physically pushing them at each other :P). \\n\\n\r\nReally, this show is so self-aware and the timing of its jokes so precise that everything feels like a giant pillow fight. The voices and sounds in the opening theme are ridiculously adorable. The ending theme, while slower, follows the same fundamental principles of cuteness. The slapstick humor in this show, which has annoyed me in numerous other shows in the past, seems cute here for some reason. Then, Mayoi and Sakaki\u2019s mischievous moe presents a nice contrast to Tsumiki and Io\u2019s quiet moe. And Hime\u2026I don\u2019t even know\u2026she\u2019s like a personification of this show\u2019s punchline, materialized. (even the title of this show is cute! Acchi Kocchi?) \\n\\n\r\nSo, my answer to, \u201cIs it cute?\u201d would have to be, \u201cI almost got diabetes.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nDoes it have substance though? That\u2019s a much tougher question to answer. This is first and foremost a comedy rather than, say, a romance or drama, so most of its runtime is dedicated to the giant pillow fight. If I start with the assumption that the pillow fight does not create substance, then I suppose there wasn\u2019t that much substance? Yet, when the show did become a little more serious, I was pleasantly surprised by how sweetly it was handled, such that I was a little disappointed that I didn\u2019t get more of it. Nevertheless, by the end of the season, there was enough good feeling here to wake up the slice of life lover in me and warm my heart. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just for that, this review comes with a solid recommendation.\\n",

While watching, I only felt amazement and shame - my eyes are not worthy to view something so perfect, almost as if it was made for the Gods themselves.\r\nWhat makes Acchi Kocchi so great, is that, on top of the gorgeous art, unique and relaxing character designs, and orgasmic soundtrack, it has the best writing one could ever possibly imagine. Fumitoshi Oizaki makes Gen Urobuchi look like a stagnant pedant who is capable of only writing children's literature. The characters are so well written I know I could diefor Tsumiki if I knew her in real life. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement, pulling you through countless ups and downs, while also managing to be something completely innovative, original, fresh. A new idea. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways I like this show and it's really a masterpiece, if you didn't like it your opinion is probably not as good as mine\\n\\n\r\n10/10 best slice of all time",

Most of it's characters are cliche character archetypes. Now, sometimes this cast of characters can make for an interesting show, but not in this case. The main character herself is very cute, and it's rather disappointing that this series was brought down by it's cliche cast. (Though I was constantly questioning what was goingon with her hair. The ahoge was cute, but what exactly are those little things on her bangs supposed to be?)\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy throughout the series was very... Different. There may be some people who find the jokes amusing, but to most I've actually spoken to about the series (and myself), the humor gets lost. This may be due to the language barrier, I'm not sure. Maybe in Japanese the jokes actually make sense and are funny. But when translated, they just aren't that funny.\\n\\n\r\nI had high hope for this anime, with all the glowing reviews, and the absolutely adorable artwork. But what I ended up with, instead, was your run of the mill slice of life anime that tries to be funny, but who's jokes just end up very dry and boring. \\n\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, it was hard to sit through even the first episode. I'm not particularly sure how I made it through the whole series.",

            "content": "\u201cKawaii\u201d - Adjective, meaning \u201ccute\u201d or \u201cadorable\u201d, and is a big element in Anime. So much so that it even has its own genre. Synonymous to \u201cmoe\u201d, \u201ckawaii\u201d has, over the years, been a definite attracting part of Anime. And nothing describes Acchi Kocchi more, then \u201ckawaii\u201d\u2026. Except maybe \u201csugoku kawaii\u201d\u2026 or \u201chounto sugoku kawaii\u201d.\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t brain straining at all. It simply revolves on the lives of a group of high-schoolers, and their wacky and mind-numbingly cute excursions. And with that, you can expect a lot of giggles, chuckles, snorts, and even the occasional, loud burst of laughter. And since we\u2019re talking about high-schoolershere, there will definitely be romance. Or in this case, a strange affection between a cat and a boy who can make any woman his with his \u201cBISHOUNEN\u201d power! (By that, I mean his looks. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, then try looking up Katsuragi, Keima from TWGOK, or Usui Takumi from Maid-Sama)\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, there definitely won\u2019t be an actual story-line. In fact, each anime episode is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). Each could either be related to the previous, or a totally different story altogether. It\u2019s kinda like watching different volumes of a gag-manga\u2026 except it\u2019s anime. This makes Acchi Kocchi a good choice to those who just want to watch something light and uncomplicated, and to those who just want to pass the time with some anime.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the art.\\n\r\nAs you may already know, the art is very cute. Living up to its manga counterpart, it is mainly composed of SD (super-deformed) characters appearing very often in the anime, courtesy of AIC. The OPs and EDs were also very nice, and deliciously executed. (\u201cDeliciously\u201d in the sense that some parts of the OPs and EDs actually look edible.) And with the transitions coupling together nicely with the overall art of the anime, makes Acchi Kocchi a neat watch. \\n\\n\r\n Now, the sound.\\n\r\nPersonally, the theme song is kind of like one of those songs that sound outright weird, but still catchy. The theme song and the end song are both fitting for the anime, but they\u2019re not really songs you\u2019d like to be stuck on repeat in your phone. \\n\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus were also pretty nice. All the voices fitted pretty nicely, although my favorite one would definitely be Mayoi. She\u2019s like that one friend who\u2019s always doing something that could be considered extremely weird and stupid to other people, but normal exclusively to her. Spouting out random irrelevant gags along the way, she is definitely an important piece in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the verdict.\\n\r\nAs a whole, Acchi Kocchi was definitely an interesting watch. It managed to keep me interested for the whole of 12 episodes and left me with a somewhat satisfied feeling when it ended. It kept me occupied for about three days, and often leaving me with unfinished homework\u2026. Well, I guess the unfinished homework was more of my fault then the anime\u2019s\u2026 (I am not a good role model. :3) Anyway, all in all, it\u2019s a great watch. I\u2019d give it an 8.5 or an 8.7, considering it\u2019s light-heartedness, although that\u2019s probably as high as I can give to an anime without an actual storyline. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to those who don\u2019t really like the seriousness of life, and just like to go out and bleed their noses with cuteness and hilarity until the sun explodes.\\n",

Acchi Kocchi may look like a clich\u00e9 at first glance, but once you get to really watch it, you'll fall in love with its sweet atmosphere.\r\nStory:\r\nThere really is nothing much to go around for this series. Acchi Kocchi is more or less a slice-of-life comedy without a deep storyline, but the episodes are well-rounded and do not seem lacking at all.\r\nArt and Sound:\r\nFor a slice of life and comedy, the art and music feels light and definitely matches the mood of the series.\r\nCharacter:\r\nNothing really special, but their simpleness is reallyone to make you like this series. A tsundere, (somewhat) shallow heartthrob, a wild science-geek, a klutz, a liberal and some other generic characters make up the main cast. The characters may be a bit overused in some anime, but in this one, they fit in well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi is filled with jokes and gags and no episode or part lacks one. Some may be overblown, and some may be subtle, but they are all truly entertaining and will really have you laughing at their gags.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThis may seem like a typical light romance anime at first impression, but once you get to watch this, even from the first episode, you will get the general idea what this anime is about, and it really delivers a unique type of enjoyment for comedy and romance fans. Nothing is overdone in this series and that is a very good thing. If you are looking for a fuzzy anime to relax and even watch as a group for light-hearted fun, this is definitely one to catch.",

            "content": "In this review, I will go through each of the core elements and provide my thoughts on why I like this anime. Before I get into the review however, I would like to say that Acchi Kocchi is a very good show if you enjoy watching very simple comedies, that don't do much other than provide you with a funny and fun time watching.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis anime has a very simple and easy-to-understand concept. Five high-school students hang around together and do hilarious things together. The anime is made even funnier with the addition of a one-way romance between Tsumiki and Io. There is not muchstory, and in the case of this anime, it is a good thing, because we watch it mainly for its comedic value and cuteness.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10 and 8/10\\n\r\nThe art, although not exactly to my style, reflects the cute nature of this anime very well by having characters designed in such a way that they are cute. While I do not pay much attention to the sound, it is vital in displaying the atmosphere and general mood of the anime, of which the light-hearted feel is upheld and portrayed very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nA good thing about this anime's characters is that there are not to many of them, with the five main characters, and a handful of side characters. There are enough people for the anime not to be boring, but also not too many characters, which will make it messy and confusing. The different personalities of the characters make for an interesting viewing as we get to know them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Impression: 10/10 and 9/10\\n\r\nBeing a comedy fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and would recommend this to people who enjoy cute and funny things. I am impressed and will watch it again, given the chance.\\n\\n\r\nTOTAL SCORE: ~8.83 (Rounded up to 9.0)",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is a very simple anime, without overcomplicating itself with unnecessary plot points or any intense action scenes or drama.  Hell, even the animation looks simple.  (Not a bad thing.) Without further ado, onto the review.  \r\nStory (6/10): Acchi Kocchi in translation means \"place to place\", entailing that the characters, or at the very least, the story, moves from place to place.  Which, indeed it does.  Acchi Kocchi branches itself into very well known slice of life animes like Lucky Star, and Nichijou, for having very simple plots.  The story itself focuses heavily on the daily life of5 distinct friends, in various situations and various \"problems\" that they face.  I say problems with quotations due to the fact that none of the actual problems they face are really of any significance later on.  As well as the added fact that they're solved incredibly easily, and seem almost pointless to begin with.  (Looking at you, K-on.)  Every episode is almost independent on one another, with having a Part A, and Part B within each episode, which provides a whole new individual story with every new part that is introduced, similar to the format Lucky Star presents itself.  While the story itself does have a romance aspect to it, with the main female lead Tsumiki having a huge crush on the main male, Io, this, like most slice of life animes with romance, goes nowhere.  While yes, it does give the viewer a ship to root for as they're watching the series, it disappoints greatly as the series simply teases the viewers on what could've added more to the show.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): The characters in this anime vary in a way that compliment each other.  First is Tsumiki.  Tsumiki, as the main female lead, has a huge crush on Io, the main character lead.  She also possesses a tsundere personality that ends up being the focus of all of the \"romance\" this anime provides.  As many people know, tsunderes do not at all, like to confess that they have feelings for someone regardless of how obvious it is.  It is because of this tsundere rule, that adds in as a key factor to the nonexistent romance.  Next is Io, the main male.  Io can be described as your typical run of the mill \"nice guy\" with glasses, that likes to help out everyone as much as he can.  Added to that, he is also extremely oblivious to Tsumiki's feelings, no matter how obvious it is.  It is this factor as well, that downfalls the romance further.  Because of these opposing forces that exist within the anime, which have been known to fail romances in the past, the anime sets itself up for failure in the romance department right from the start.  Next is Sakaki, your typical best friend/punching bag character.  As my description entails, Sakaki is the \"comic relief\" character.  He is constantly getting harassed by his friends, and constantly gets thrown into the sky.  (Not kidding.)  He is entertaining, but the anime troupe itself has been done many times before, and this is really no different.  Next, Mayoi.  As one of the other existing girls in the main 5 characters, Mayoi serves as the female comic relief character.  Constantly getting hurt like Sakaki does, and usually brings it upon herself.  Again, this has been done before, and the whole character itself seems pretty generic.  And last, is Hime, my personal favorite.  As probably one of the most moe characters I've seen in a slice of life, Hime is the blood donor.  What I mean by that, is the fact that Hime has constant nosebleeds.  Constant.  While yes, I think she's an adorable character that talks with a -desu ending, her real purpose is kind of pointless, seeing as how half the time she has a nosebleed that doesn't seem to kill her from blood loss.  The side characters aren't really that special, considering that they don't get all that much screen time.  They're more like background characters that get to speak.  \\n\\n\r\nSound and Art (7/10): The sound for the anime is very...cute.  The OP is very catchy and overall adorable.  With an upbeat tempo and a very happy sound to it, I found myself dancing in my seat as I watched it.  Yes, it was simply that adorable.  The ending to me was a bit disappointing, as it sounded like cute fodder.  The ending was a generic cute song with a single singer, and I wasn't compelled enough to really sit through and listen to it.  The tracks in the anime are basic background tracks.  Nothing special there.  The art itself has a very striking resemblance to the 2 slice of life shows I've mentioned before, Lucky Star, and Nichijou.  The characters are all drawn in a chibi art style, with the occasional evil glance, blank stare, erupting cat ears, and over exaggerated expressions.  The colors they use is more of a lighter tone, giving it a more simple feel with some proper shading.  While yes, the art is very cute, it's still very simple, and has been used several times before.  I don't find anything special with how the characters are drawn, compared to the actual character designs themselves.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8/10): Acchi Kocchi is very cute.  It's adorable, even.  It was so adorable, that I literally had a nosebleed as I was watching the series.  While Acchi Kocchi has its flaws in its romance aspect, the overall sound, and quite possibly the less in-depth characterization of the characters, I throughly enjoyed it.  Slice of life animes are meant to be simple, and should be enjoyed as such.  The comedy of this anime was over the top and can be dramatic when it wants to be.  It doesn't try hard to be entertaining, and it doesn't need to be.  I found myself watching episode after episode, enjoying every second of every side plot they introduced, and laughed at the weird tangents that their conversations can turn to.  In the end, Acchi Kocchi is a very simple anime, and should be enjoyed as such.  I would recommend this show to anyone who would want to watch an anime where they can sit back, and just relax.  And word to the wise, bring some tissues; you don't want to stain your carpet.",

            "content": "The driving spirit behind any production is the appeal it provides to others. What anime has done well over the past few years is provide a diverse selection of animated stories (although unbalanced) to those with a stubborn mindset. Every year, hundreds of anime titles spanning all sorts of genres are released to the public, providing entertainment for those who tip their fancy to mystery, action, sci-fi, mecha, slice of life, and especially ecchi-comedies. One of the aforementioned genres, slice of life, was nothing but a concept ten years ago. Now, it's become one of the mainstay forms of entertainment among anime titles. To thoseon a slice of life fixation, Acchi Kocchi is a title that will flip their fedoras, however proves unsubstantial to those prune to the easy-going genre.\\n\\n\r\nWith any slice of life, plot is used only for temporary purposes. It swiftly shifts from place to place whenever necessary to continue the overview of the series. What Acchi Kocchi provides is a set of two stories for each episode, labeled \"Part A\" and \"Part B.\" This, in turn, makes the series feel more structured in content and proceeds like a fine-tuned machine. However, ruins any feeling of an easy-going continuation of the story. It simply feels like a collection of stories. Another point to make is that the series starts off during the winter, where the characters' signature heavy clothing comes into play. Within four episodes, it skips the spring and catapults straight into the summer. Within the next four episodes, it goes back to skipping one season and settling for the one after, winter, until the series finally ends on March 14th. Through twelve episodes, consisting of two sub-stories within them, the series jumps a year and a half in length. This title truly is a slice of life, as it leaves the other seven-eighth's to dry out in the summer sun.\\n\\n\r\nHowever way the plot proceeds, the major focus of a slice of life is to showcase the characters of the story, and Acchi Kocchi provides quite a few. Each character present has their own role in the show and never strays away from it. When it comes to romance, which Acchi Kocchi doesn't seem to know anything about, the same two characters are involved in every scenario. When it comes to comedy, which Acchi Kocchi is far better at than romance, each character has their own \"unique\" way of trying to produce chuckles from the audience. One character does so through jealousy and embarrassed reactions. Another through their own density; saying things which are inappropriate for the given situation. But mostly, the characters provide comedy through slapstick that defies the laws of, well, everything.\\n\\n\r\nWhat one may find apparent while watching Acchi Kocchi is the complete lack of detail given to each character personally. Within the first episode, one will come to understand the worth of every character through their actions. Beyond that, no more information is provided. Acchi Kocchi's characters are those that the audience can only take at face value. Identifying with the characters can only come from how they react to any scene. This being known, watching Acchi Kocchi can be compared to watching a short movie on a brave knight rescuing a princess from a decrepit castle filled with dangerous creatures. There is no character building. The series relies solely on the emotions provided by the environment to produce amusement among those who choose to accept it.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, what better way to evoke emotion than to pander to our weakness for anything adorable? Acchi Kocchi believes in the philosophy that if anything is cute or \"moe,\" people will wait in line till nightfall for it. Everything presented in this series is tailor-made for some sort of cliche \"moe\" fetish. One of the main characters, Tsumiki, has cat ears and a tail, and will react appropriately depending on her mood. Whenever something embarrassing happens or someone says something slightly risque, the characters' noses will start spurting blood like a fire hose. The characters' designs in general are chibi-like and colorful, especially the female characters. Everyone looks young and no one looks old. Even the school teacher looks and acts like she could be a part of the main group. Everything is so innocent that it's disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nWhile everything out front looks cookie-cutter in general, the background lacks the same appeal. When looking behind the characters' faces, one can notice that the detail behind them is faded into a sort of mist. This \"mist\" may have something to do with creating a dream-like effect on the title, making it seem so mystifying or calming that one can't help but feel elation. However, it could also be seen as a lack of effort by the production team to make the series look realistic. Of course, Acchi Kocchi doesn't look realistic in the slightest anyway. Another interesting tidbit is that the background characters, those that don't speak or have anything to do with the story, don't move and don't have eyes. Lazy? Perhaps. I like to think they don't have eyes because they tore them off having to look at the lack of effort.\\n\\n\r\nThere are few things that are certain in this world. One's nationality, the Simpsons airing, and everyone having an opinion are three such things. If one wishes to indulge themselves in a finer slice of life series, Acchi Kocchi could be right up their alley. However, they should be warned that, as with most slice of life titles, everything is skin deep. The type of merriment this series provides only stems from the emotions that one is willing to give to enjoy it. Most of the characters are dull, the comedy goes to overly-exaggerated means to induce humor, and the art could make even the most brutal of people develop a sweet tooth. Acchi Kocchi isn't something to experience, it's something to watch, despite its intentions. And with enough experience, one can only remember this title to forget this title.",

Tsumiki is the legit female lead and well she has a thing for Io but she cant get her self to really say anything to him and also the fact she is a tsundere kinda hurts her with telling him as well overall shes a kinda shy character but really friendly unless you get on her side when you try to get to Io. Mayoi is a another lead character she is really the tech person of the anime so does a lot of ambitious stuff that be either creating stuff or saying stuff that ends up Tsumiki whaling on her (or just getting punched by Tsumiki) otherwise a pretty up and going character with jokes for sure. Hime is another lead she is well almost reminds me of Tsumiki but Hime is really scared of certain stuff and does get chronic nosebleeds as well otherwise a character who is shy and gets scared super easy about anything shes told as well. Sakaki is the last lead of this and well i don't personally know i to describe him he kinda reminds of Mayoi expect the fact hes not a tech persona and more just a wing man for Io does tend to get hurt a lot like Mayoi and does tend to crack a lot of jokes between Tsumiki and Io kinda like Mayoi as well otherwise a good character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: thing that i liked: the comedy is really well done took me a bit to like the comedy but when i did it was REALLY well done also that the characters are really good and just funny in there own right as well. Things that i didn't like: i think this is more of the people who are goona watch this if you don't like people who constantly nosebleed and or a tsundere or 2 than yeah don't watch but that more for the people who are goona watch as me for nothing honestly found nothing wrong with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: giving this a 8 the comedy was really well done wouldn't say laugh out loud funny but there were a good number of moments for me also that i personally loved all the characters in this anime a anime that is worth the watch for sure.",

Each week left me with laughs and simple morals like friendship and comedy are important in life. It has been a while since there has been such an anime with a refine storyline and plot. In my own opinion, this show rivals Bleach, Naruto, One Piece and all the rest that overdo the lenght of the story. Sometimes simple and funny is the best way to appeal to the viewer.Although this show may be overlook due to shows that are popular today. I loved ever minute of each episode, except for the finale, which sort of went a different direction that I was anticipation. Aside from that I strongly recommend this show to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nArt: How do I put this? The Art is undeniably incredible. The simplicity of the art reflects the theme of \"Slice-of-life\" which most shows try to create with their own style. The Art is comparable to Lucky Star. I for one love the simplicity and would love more shows to have the same style of artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The dialogue and BMG are outstanding and would not have it any other way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters compliment each other as each of them have a specific role that the cover for the comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a show that will leave you with the thought of Io and Tsumiki and how their relationship grows as each episode passes. I would LOVE if the made a season 2, but sometimes there are things that are better left in one awesome season filled comedy, thrills and love that friends love to pick on.",

Please don't get me wrong, I'm a big sucker for slice of life anime and this one just hits the sweet spot for me, but as I'm trying to let other people know about the anime I feel that I should be as objective as possible in givingmy ratings. \\n\\n\r\nAnd without further ado:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nSlice of life anime's Achilles heel is definitely the story. Acchi Kocchi by itself is no exception. The plot revolves around a close group of friends in high school and how they spend their daily lives in school, getting involved in idiotic-but-cute activities and...romance. The plot, like usual with slice of life anime, is a matter of hit or miss. While its relaxing and laid back nature might be more than adequate for fan of the genre, people who are looking for more serious and elaborate storyline should make their choice elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nLike the other reviewer has said, the cast of Acchi Kocchi is a combination of cliched archetype characters. From the more dere than tsun Tsumiki to the cool and composed Io, the slightly perverted sidekick Sakaki, the wacky, mad scientist Mayoi and the othodox klutz Hime...individually, they are not that great, but when put in such settings, actually prove to synergize well with others. How could someone not enjoy the sight of Io and Tsumiki getting into a romantic sittuation, only to be sabotaged by the deliberate third-wheel combo Sakaki and Mayoi, while having Hime nosebleed like a mini fountain in complement? I also found that this character combination helps prevent the romance from being overly \"warm\" and mushy-gushy, retaining the easygoing mood for the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe cutesy art in Acchi Kocchi, while nothing extraordinary taken out of context, seems to work well with the other elements. Characters and scenery are well polished and portrayed in a manner that extremely helps in describing the carefree and heartwarming atmosphere of the show.The combination of Tsumiki's various expressions (including the cat ears that occasionally pop out), Mayoi's catlike upper lip, the arrow transitions, etc... gives the show an unique touch and distinguishes it with others of the same genre (Hime could do with a bit less of nosebleed though :3 ).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nReally great voice acting here! Tsumiki's tsundere shyness, Io's composure and calmness, Mayoi's wackiness...are all absolutely well expressed. It gives me the feeling that the voice acting has been carefully considered, and if you don't mind, tailored to give such excellent result. Also, the OP and ED, while do not sound terribly brilliant, are cute (sounds like the perfect word to describe the series) and catchy nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment, when it comes to specific show and different individuals, has always been a matter of \"your mileage might vary\". Specifically, I wholeheartedly enjoy the show despite its obvious plot drawback since that works for me. Putting aside all the complicated stuff, watching anime to me is simply to put a smile on my face and make me happy, and as another reviewer has also said, this season I have a reason to look forward to Friday.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIf complicated story, awesome fighting scenes and wonderfully designed characters are what you're looking for, then I'm sorry to say but you probably would not fare too far with Acchi Kocchi. But if you're the same as me, seeking for your slice of life fill of the season with cute characters, heartwarming atmosphere and a touch of comedy, then this one is undoubtedly for you.\\n\\n",

If you like Nichijou (We pretty much we all do) then you will like Acchi Kocchi. It's similar enough to Nichijou that it's enjoyable, but not so similar that it's a ripoff.\r\nAcchi Kocchi is kinda like atamer version of Nichijou, but it's still good.\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi has a simplistic art style like Nichijou, but it also has a myriad of beautiful effects that makes it appealing, like Nichijou. Also some pretty NOT slice of life things happen.\\n\\n\r\nLike that pretty much all the characters have superhuman strength at some point (Except Hime)\\n\r\nor at least ridiculous sport skills (or pen twirling)\\n\r\nOr how everything gravitates toward Sakaki, to hit the poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is actually pretty good, but romance wise...eh.\\n\r\nDon't come here looking for romance, I mean yeah Io and Tsumiki look adorable together, but at the end, nothing progressed between them..\\n\\n\r\nBut i'm sure both of them know deep down, they're like this:\\n\\n\r\n\"We're a thing\"\\n\\n\r\nSo I'll just leave it at that.\\n\r\nAll the voice actors are good, and the music will probably either grow on you, or annoy you.\\n\r\nBut all in all I think it's an adorable comedy and I highly recommend if you like Nichijou.\\n\r\nI wish I had my own pet Tsumiki, and Io's amazing pen spinning skills.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!\\n\\n",

            "content": "The best way to describe Acchi Kocchi in a few words is: fluffy relaxation. At least that's how it felt for me. This is the kind of anime that just makes you fell all warm and cuddly inside. So it might not be for everyone. If you are looking for drama or serious conflict this is not the anime for you, but if you want to just melt in your chair and get a smile over your face for a few hours watch it! \r\nStory 6/10: Seeing how this is a slice of life rom-com about a girl who likes a boy set in aschool environment, there isn't much of a story to talk about. Shy girl like boy acts all cutesy and stuff, that's all you need to know. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The art is nothing to brag about but it's enough for this type of anime. Some might complain about the lack of proper textures of most people except for the main characters but you only need to see the main characters and the interactions between them. Plus the textures on the rest of the people can be looked at as artistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:  The sound is ok with a rare or to my knowledge unique intro it's uniqueness coming from the fact that it's a duet. It's cheerful and energetic, maybe to energetic, compared to the pace of the anime which is more lax. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: The characters are all interesting and funny but the main attraction is Tsumiki, the female lead who is just the cutest thing ever. And by that I don't mean only looks, her interactions and her personality just makes you want to pat her and protect her like a cute little cat. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  9/10: I really enjoyed this anime. I realize it might not be everyone's cup of tea but if you feel the need for something heart warming from time to time, an anime like this is the best thing! For some people it might just have to much cuteness and fluffiness but it really put a smile on my face throughout the hole thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: Trying to be as objective as possible I will give this anime a 7 but I totally recommend it. If you enjoy bathing it a tone of cuteness from time to time, go watch this anime, you will not be disappointed.  \\n\\n",

Sasaki and Mayoi the mischievous duo, Hime the cute and cuddly friend, made up the main supporting characters. Whilst Io and Tsumiki made together the best couple ever. Every supporting or main character had a pleasant or recognizable role in this anime, and reappeared throughout the series, adding much enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 9/10: Sure it killed time, but it was a 'cutsie' anime like no other, a gem and a pleasure to watch. Acchi Kocchi did leave me wanting more, wanting further development between the main and supporting characters and their adventures. However, it left a warm fuzzy feeling within me, a happy person, and thus, it was an amazingly enjoyable anime.\\n",

The jokes were quite refreshing though there were some few jokes I totally saw coming. Each episode was filledwith warm fuzzy happiness along with jokes that were perfectly pulled off.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7\\n\r\nSince this is a SoL anime, you can't expect an extraordinary over-the-top plot. Rather than that, it has a simple plot that people of all ages(bet even 2 year olds) can understand. The anime is about a group of high schoolers and their daily lives. It also frequently inserts cute scenes mainly consisting of Io........where, if you're a girl, you're bound to lose your senses and pass out. The jokes in this anime, as I view them, are chuckle or giggle material though there are certain hilarious scenes that made me rofl(literally). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was the main reason I was drawn to watching this anime. The art really suited the anime and its atmosphere. The art kinda reminded me of Lucky Star and K-On(Dunno why it reminded me of the latter). It was consistent throughout the entire series and I love consistent art~ The chibi scenes were really cute and really suited the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nFirst of all, the OP was super-duper cute, even cuter when you understand the lyrics!! The OST were soothing and relaxing, and blended really well with the scenes. My personal favorite would be 'Washa Washa', I just simply love the soothing vibe it gives off. The voice acting in this anime was superb and their voice really brought out the characters. And concluding every episode, we have a cutesy IoxTsumiku ED by Tsumiki's seiyuu. 'Te o Gyu Shite ne' is love, it is life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters were all unique- The tsundere loved by all, Tsumiki with her frequent 'Neko' glares and cute dialogues. Our handsome male protagonist, Io with his pen-spinning top notch accuracy and out of this world smile. The airhead Hime with a nosebleed pretty much every time something cute happens between Io and Tsumiki or Io sends out his lovely smile. Our comedic duo(and 'M's), Mayoi and Sakaki; without these two I don't think the show would be complete.......though that can also be said for the entire cast.\\n\r\nThe other characters besides our main cast are all so interesting as well, I truly wish for such a circle of friends~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and loved every single second of it. It left me with butterflies in my stomach, yearning for a high-school life such as in this anime. I personally think that 12 episodes were just not enough. The show was not only enjoyable, it was a 25 minutes escape from reality and really soothed the depressed and stressed heart.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, I loved and really enjoyed this anime. It'll always occupy a special place in my heart. Even you've finished the anime once or twice, it's always re-watchable so don't worry if you're about to finish it for the first time. If you can spare a day or so of the series your watching right now for Acchi Kocchi, I'm 101% sure you won't regret it. Seems I won't be forgetting this anime any time soon.",

            "content": "Story -7-\r\nThe story of Acchi Kocchi is one that follows a different plot every half episode, while also staying connected with the different stories. The overarching storyline, however, is the little romance that is slowly growing between Tsumiki and Io. The whole feel of the series is light and cheerful, but also gives a few moments where Tsumiki and Io can feel very close and bring out a reaction from the audience.\r\nSince this series does not have any deep messages, nor was the plot anything too special it does not rate all that high. However, it was able to keep continuity and keep the audienceengaged. The short gags that they did also connect as most of the gags were due to certain traits from different characters. With this, one would be able to see a repeated gag whenever that character would show their tick, such as Io being excellent at spinning whatever was in his hands, be a pen, pencil, or a pair of chopsticks.\\n\\n\r\nArt -7-\\n\r\nThe art style of Acchi Kocchi is very palatable, and nothing overly special. With the pastel colors and very \u2018chibi\u2019 like drawings, the anime is easy to appeal to a middle-high school audience. There is also much use of hiragana to make it easier for the audience to feel relaxed. The use of very simple facial reactions made it so the different reactions of the cast were well received as well.\\n\r\nThe main gag in the series is that Tsumiki\u2019s reactions are always in reference to how a cat acts. Thankfully the anime can pull it off very well, as it could have been incredibly painful to watch if it had been done the wrong way. However, since it was done correctly, it was funny and also rather cute to see the reactions Tsumiki had, along with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound -7-\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the series was rather spot on. Each one of the characters could fully portray their personality through how they spoke. Also, they were able to hit quite a few gags due to how fast they were able to keep the thing going. The little side remarks or small sound effects the voice actors would do fully brought each character to life.\\n\r\nThe opening and closing themes were also enjoyable as they fit the mood of the anime as a whole. The opening theme was a lot more upbeat and worked in the anime\u2019s favor of trying to get the audience excited to watch. The closing theme wound everyone down, returning the attention to the over-arching plot of how Tsumiki wanted to be in a relationship with Io. Over all, the sound was able to keep the whole series rather nicely wrapped up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9-\\n\r\nSlice of life animes needs to have strong characters. Otherwise, they will fall flat and will be boring to watch; it will be pretty unentertaining to be blunt. That being said, the characters in Acchi Kocchi were extremely enduring and funny to watch. Tsumiki was adorable to watch in her attempts to try and express to Io how she was feeling, while Io was, while rather deadpan, an amazing friend. It was not hard to see why Tsumiki liked him, unlike in some animes where it is a mystery as to why the main character likes someone else.\\n\r\nAlong with the two main characters, the side characters were also entertaining. Mayoi was always able to lighten the mood with one of her crazy inventions, or with teasing her best friend about her crush. Sakaki, while he was not in as many episodes once the series started to get rolling, was still rather funny whenever he would appear. Slap-stick humor is sometimes hard to pull off, as if it\u2019s done wrong, the audience just feels sorry for the victim. However, Sakaki, the main victim of the physical humor, was always able to make the joke pull through. Overall, the characters of Acchi Kocchi were just an absolute pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -8-\\n\r\nSlice-of-life anime is all rather similar, as the category isn\u2019t one that\u2019s supposed to fluctuate all that often. However, the enjoyment of Acchi Kocchi was a rather pleasant surprise. Following the main characters through a full year of their lives, the audience can see as they start to grow as people. Not only are they honest and hardworking, but they also know how to have fun and relax once they no longer have classes. It brings up memories of having to study for those days where it feels impossible to do so, the feeling of having a job and knowing the reasonability that one has.\\n\r\nOne of the best moments of the series is near the end, where valentine\u2019s day shows up again, as it had done in the 2nd episode. This repeat shows how Tsumiki and Io have grown in affection for each other, as Tsumiki makes chocolates that are special for just Io; Io returning the favor by putting a special treat in his gift to her. It warms the audience\u2019s heart, ending the series with a feeling that those two will be all right, whatever happens.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -7.6-\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi is a nice anime just to sit down and watch a few episodes. By the end of the series, there is a warm feeling, knowing that the main characters will be okay, with fond memories of the past, and the sense of one\u2019s first love. The pastel coloring and well-done voice acting will keep the anime in a good light. There isn\u2019t anything too bad to say about the anime, as it is an excellent series, but it isn\u2019t anything too amazing.\\n\r\nIt was not trying to be an outstanding anime, as its main goal was just trying to be a small series to consume and be satisfied with. While some of the gags may not make you laugh, and sometimes it can be a bit over the top, Acchi Kocchi will compel the viewer to finish. Even if they do not like the genre all that much, it\u2019s a feel good anime that anyone feeling down on their luck should give a try.\\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is a fairly good comedy that is based on everyday things. The show does follow the basic anime forumlas (school, home-visits, beach, swimming etc..) but does it in a little more classy way.\r\n~Story~ 5/10\r\nThere really isn't much of a story. The premise is pretty much the same as other random comedy shows, but has lots of romantic over-tones.\r\nTsumiki has a big crush on Io, but has no guts to say so or to confess to him. So, the other members of their group picks on her and sets her up with lots of romantic opportunities.\r\nOverall, the show focuses mostly on random comedy thathappens on an everyday basis.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was great, it was mostly consistent, but there were times that cat-ears would suddenly appear and cut-aways were very frequent.\\n\r\nNose-bleeds were rampant and happened almost every 3 minutes.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 7/10\\n\r\nThe intro music and background music for the entire show was great. The voice acting was as expected from a comedy show.\\n\r\nHowever, I didn't like how the characters often had lines describing what the viewer is actually seeing. As an American I am lost to some foreign comedy, but I understood Acchi Kocchi very well and enjoyed it thoroughly without needing the characters telling me what I'm seeing.\\n\r\nAnother minor thing about the voice acting is that it seemed very robotic and overly simplified.\\n\r\nI suppose that is more of a writing/scripting problem rather than a voice acting one.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ 6/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't much character development, but what development did happen was focused on Tsumiki and Io.\\n\r\nThe gang is your ordinary comedy group. There is a super-short and strong character (Tsumiki), the stoic and quiet (Io), there is a klutz (Hime), the brainy scientist (Mayoi) and energetic supporting male character (Sakaki).\\n\r\nThey all mix and match well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed the show. The comedy was great and the formulas were predictable, but I truly enjoyed watching this.\\n\r\nNow, I'm off to find more like it.",

            "content": "Sometimes it's fruitful to take a step back and examine the basic workings of what we have come to accept. Like taking apart a cheeseburger to see just exactly what's in it and how much effort actually went into making it. Acchi Kocchi is a romantic-comedy without a gimmick. No dumb vampire lore, no petty revenge plot, no bullshit gynophobia problems, just she likes him, and she's koi about it and BAM! There's your anime.\r\nAcchi Kocchi is the story of Tsumiki struggling to confess her crush on her friend Io. That's it. That's the whole extent of the plot. It presents itself as a sortof slice of life way, and that works pretty well. Tsumiki is a well defined character, and her shyness card is not the only one in her deck. She feels more like an actual human being, rather than a marionette going through the motions of a romcom. She takes herself seriously, and is incredibly strong, and yet she still lets her feminine side out whenever she can. Now, I have said before that I have a weakness for shy characters, and now is as good a time as any to explain why. Basically, there are three reasons. 1: I feel shyness is a good place to start to build character development. There are many ways to characterize shyness, whether it be eventually drawing them out or even just understanding what they're shy about. It presents a slew of never ending possibilities. 2: Shyness is a very relateable trait for many people, including myself. Most people have been shy in any number of situations, and I feel close to shy characters because I'm not very good at approaching people I don't know, or even people I do know at some times. 3: THEY'RE SO ADORABLE! Tsumiki provides great examples of all three. Her shyness characterizes her greatly, I could relate to her problems very well and SHE'S SO ADORABLE! Needless to say, she's the best character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is pretty good too. Io is the oblivious love interest of the show. I will say, his characterization is slow going, but around episode 5 or 6 I think, his characterization gets really good and is characterized outside of an oblivious cool person who could get any girl he wants. Their friends are also pretty well-developed to the extent that they need to be as well. Hime is the confused nice girl who finds cuteness in anything she can. Sakaki is the guy who's all talk but is pretty much the buttmonkey of the whole group. Mayoi is the strange, enigmatic inventor of the group and the buttmonkey runner-up. Those three provide a good chunk of the humor in the series and they're all likeable to at least some extent.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good, but I feel it could have been better. It's not bad, I just feel it's trying too hard. The art is interestingly light and fluffy, but also just a tad unreal. I feel the art could have tried harder a little bit. It's still good and interesting and all, but it needs work.\\n\\n\r\nThe music does a good job fitting the mood. It matches the mood of the scene just right. It's nice and slow when it wants us to take it seriously, and it gets all loud and bombastic whenever something funny happens. Though, the opening is kind of not fitting. It's goofy and pop-y and just doesn't seem to match the show all the way. It's a good song, but I think the effort was mis-placed. The ending theme is very good though. It's nice, soft, and relaxing, just what you'd expect from this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voices, they do a great job at bringing out what we love about the cast. For each emotion that these characters have, the voice-actor finds a voice suitable for it. Everyone is perfectly cast and performs their character excellently.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor of the show is what I really like about Acchi Kocchi. It has some very great lively subtle humor. That portion of humor directly stems from the crush that Tsumiki has on Io. It's both adorable and really hilarious. However, Acchi Kocchi also has some humor that's about as subtle as a drunk clown at a rave. I think they could have used less of that though, and focus more on the subtle humor of it all. Still, to its credit, the non-subtle humor is still funny and doesn't take away from the subtle humor, and it does give Hime, Sakaki, and Mayoi more characterization. I think they focused more on that kind of humor because the creators weren't sure that the subtle humor alone could draw in as many viewers, and that's understandable. No matter what it is, there's always at least one member of the audience that can't understand something more complex than throwing a pie at someone's face, and designing something to draw in more of an audience is understandable, and it works in this case because it doesn't ruin any of the subtle humor that not everyone understands. The humor is very funny in either area and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Acchi Kocchi is a very good anime. The characters are great, the humor is funny, the production values are splendid and it's an overall enjoyable experience.  It does have some flaws, but the good outweighs the bad tenfold. 8/10",

However, it actually had something more that I did not expect to get from this show; which was 'Tsundere + Oblivious's romance story. \r\nMy favourite bits from this anime was the character structure. With only 12episodes, the writer was able to input the personas of each character to us viewer and feel somewhat close to the characters.

            "content": "Just like the anime and the way it delivers things, this review will also be pretty simple on the matter. It also contains spoilers at random points and I was too lazy to write up warnings, mainly cause it's a comedy anime anyway. I will make sure to avoid spoiling the more majorly funny parts about it, though.\r\nNow, Acchi Kocchi. If you are looking for an anime that has zero clich\u00e9, this anime will feel right at home in the best possible way. Its comedy is quick, yet humorous. Its love story is portrayed hilariously well and the overall enjoyment you have in this animewill be at an all-time high. For its short run, I feel like they knew they had a short amount of time to work with and aimed to fill every episode with nothing but solid comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a skit anime, something that normally only gives you a few laughs from time to time. However, this one gives you a laugh in nearly EVERY scene you watch of it. Never will you feel like this anime is boring you because it honestly would have trouble boring anyone, even somebody that hates the medium. From start to finish, its flow is always the same and the only real development is between the two main characters that the anime heavily advertises.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it does not feel like a harem at all. Yes, there is a majority of girls, but there are two guys and the amount of girls is only one more than the amount of guys; counting every character from not only main, but recurring ones as well, there are a total of five females and three guys, so it still balances out rather well. \\n\\n\r\nThough, I am only counting students here, cause you actually rarely see the adults where I can only put them in the minor category; and for an anime of twelve episodes, that means they basically do not show up at all. And yes, sadly, if you never watched a harem, some do pair up the high school student with adults at times. If you are into that stuff, it is not a problem of  course. Just some free hentai! Ha, just kidding, nothing usually happens anyway when that scenario actually IS in play cause the plot is usually the male pervert, or even innocent, usually being scolded by them anyway.\\n\\n\r\nIn an actual harem, all of the girls are usually main characters, so that is why I can not call this a harem in the slightest at all, in that only three of the girls are main characters and all they do is entertain the audience, rather than drooling over the main boy.\\n\\n\r\nIn defense, though, the main boy DOES deliver his romantic lines, alongside doing other noble things, well enough to give two of the main girls nosebleeds a lot; probably the only real clich\u00e9 that this anime has, though two of the girls are not madly in love with him anyway. And it happens quite often, too.\\n\\n\r\nIt's always funny whenever it does happen, though, so you will probably never grow bored of it. Outside that, the main boy is basically portrayed as Mr. Perfect and has a lot of unique talents, skills and has a rational sense of thinking. So, there is NO way you could ever call this a harem even if you tried your hardest. He is just a generally good character and it is very rare to actually see a comedy where they not only threw in male leads, but actually made them saints. It reminds us that not all males are perverted.\\n\\n\r\nNow, his friend on the other hand...at the very most, is still just hilarious and funny. So, nope, he is not a pervert, either. His delivery of comedy is pretty good as well and he does become the butt of some jokes in a few episodes, which is handled very well. He also thinks quite rationally at times, but not as much as the other one.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the females, you have one that is down to earth so that the anime has some normal balance to it, complete with generic brunette hairstyle that actually IS a natural hair color. Okay, actually, two more of the females do have natural hair colors, too. Her purpose is to just have a normal opinion on the absurdity that the anime is and it is quite funny as the end result. She has the most contrast from everyone, but only in that she is the most normal of all of them. She actually is one of the main characters, so you will see her every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two could honestly be paired up with the two males due to lacking any noticeable differences from them. Two of them think rationally and have special talents that the others don't, well the other two aim to entertain the audience in the most original fashion possible. They make the characters so obviously similar that you would not pair anyone else up with them; and yet, they also are opposites in a few ways as well that gives you all the more reason to ship them. And, I do not want to describe their characters because they are too good where I'd rather you watch them in action yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMy only negativities of this anime strive from the romance finale being a bit disappointing, especially when you watch the episode before it that hinted at something much more serious about to go down with the two characters. Though, in spite of this, the finale episode was the most serious of the entire anime and does actually turn it into a pretty casual Slice of Life with balanced comedy and drama as it progresses. However, I am just going to call what happened at the end a \"kiss\" since I do not know what else to call it. It was still heartwarming and sweet, though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, well its English name makes sense (\"Place to Place\") as it implies that the comedy is always on the go, and I believe that is the translation of the anime name in general, I just like calling it Acchi Kocchi.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and unfortunately it does have just ONE clich\u00e9, but it still does it in an original fashion. As you know, a MAJORITY of comedy anime usually use cats as a plot device for the comedy, and Acchi Kocchi follows this standard yet again with a few characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the main female lead. Instead of her having them on her head all the time, they only come out whenever she is expressing more emotion than usual; which is funny since it doesn't leave them on her the whole time like most cat clich\u00e9 anime comedies do to be funny, or whenever the girl reacts just a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe other most notable female lead also usually ends her sentences with the Japanese terms for cat noises. In most cases, the way she times it and how she pronounces it are actually quite hilarious. So, again, reinventing anime clich\u00e9 done right once more.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, one recurring character has her hair in the obvious shape of sprouting cat ears, which are on her head all of the time. However, unlike the main female lead, they do not look like obvious cat ears (yes, I am implying that the main female lead's do and actually move as such as well) and, rather, just looks like her hair was shaped like them. They never move or anything, and she never makes cat noises, so it is more of a visual sight that you would only notice if you are familiar with anime. They are about half the size of how big they normally look as well.\\n\\n\r\nBut, yeah, I barely put any depth in this review because I did want to avoid spoiling anything, even the NAMES. That being said, a lot of my reviews have been lacking depth lately, so I will try to fix that when I review something that has the depth for me to analyze it with a more insightful approach, cause it has been a while since I had one that had a ton of effort into it due to my interest being mostly into comedies.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Acchi Kocchi does comedy again like most in its genre do, but I give it such a high rating because its delivery of comedy is very original; and I do not want to go on about that to avoid spoiling the experience for you, even though I already did a bit earlier.\\n\\n\r\nIt is something where, if you decide to watch it, you will not be upset that you did at all. At the very least, you would still be above average on your opinion about this anime, cause neutral or anything below just means you do not enjoy anime or comedies for that matter. It would take a very hateful person to truly dislike this one, let alone feel neutral about it.",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered to yourself: \"What is too much moe?\"? If so, there's your answer. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH MOE.\r\nThis show will give you diabetes from how cute it is. Even if you're not into this sort of anime (I'm personally not so much) You'll like this show.\r\nIt doesn't have a real story, just an adorable loli (not sexualised, finally) trying to get out of the friendzone while sometimes acting a bit like a tsundere (But in a cute way. Believe me, I hate tsunderes, but she's so lovable).\r\nIn terms of characters, this show doesn't accels in it's depth/characterdevelopment. It's just the regular friends hanging out and that's it. Nothing more. Of course all of the girls like the mc and get a nosebleeed every five seconds because of him, but still. Their all cute and none of the characters makes me want to serious-punch them right in the face (I'm looking at you Louise from Zero no Tsukaima.......).\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is decent, maybe slightly above average. it constantly jumps from cute-chibi style to normal style (Which is also cute), and I personally like it. It really suits to the whole style of this show. Which is of course, CUTE.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is actually fairly good because it matches the show's theme PERFECTLY. The opening and ending alone are awesome and really fit in with the whole \"cute\" vibe this show has.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show. I'd recommand it to anyone who knows he doesn't hate moe. Some people hate it with a passion and think moe is cancer, but hey. if you're not one of those guys/girls, watch it. And if you're new to this whole genre, start with this. It's an excellent show with the most adorable moments you'll ever see. Plus if you're tired of all the oppai-fanservice in anime lately, try moe-fanservice. It's harmless and adorable.",

This is neither a bad thing or a good thing in my mind but there wasn't really a story. And there's no kiss. That's my big criteria for a romance slice of life, that make or break. I really enjoyed the circle things they used to separate stories kind or made me think of the 4 panel manga it was based off of. \r\nArt- Average, passable, Cute. I didn't really like the main male Character design but it'snothing to complain over. \\n\\n\r\nSound- literally either the best or second best ive heard. I listened to the op and ending song every time. I even found myself trying to sing it (badly). Cute lyrics and catch tune. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-- pretty much every MC reminded me of another MC from other shows. The characters are wonderful to watch even if this does feel like a Japan equivalent of sponge bob. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed this to pieces. Looking for a collectors set and LE because it deserves a home.",

I don\u2019t dislike cats but I\u2019ve been conditioned to be cold to cats due to my biological factor. \r\nSo the question is what else does this show have for someone who is allergic to the main concept?\r\nAcchi Kocchi format is of a gag show. \r\nI have had many conversations in the past about the lack of progression in gag shows.\r\nMy opponents comeback with the argument that if their was more plot thanit would ruin the show.\\n\r\nI have not been convinced on that. I don\u2019t see why gag shows still can\u2019t have progression. Even if only a little bit per episode. \\n\r\nThere is nothing different in the relationship between Tsumiki and Io from episode 1 to episode 12. It is a shame because they are a nice couple. \\n\\n\r\nGag shows are also very side character oriented \\n\r\nIf the main characters are lacking in progression than it is the side characters that need to step up to keep you entertained. \\n\r\nYou don\u2019t get that with Acchi. Besides Mayoi, whom could be argued as the best character in the show, everyone else is rather insignificant. \\n\r\nOne is only there to nosebleed, one is just there to be the insignificant second male, and the other three\u2026.well there isn\u2019t really anything to say about them. \\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t that really annoying character though like the bird in Tamako Market. Acchi Kocchi has that going for it. \\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is that beyond the cute cat moments there isn\u2019t much else here on why it would be advantageous for someone to watch this show. \\n\r\nThe characters are average, the story is pretty nonexistent, and the art style does provide some entertainment. \\n\r\nI do like little touches like at the end of the episode it shows off the movement to the next episode like were moving from level to level. That is basically the biggest progression of the show. \\n\r\nMy final score would be a 6 out of 10. I\u2019m unsatisfied with the other elements but I can\u2019t find any annoyances or faults to knock the show down to a 5. \\n\r\nIf your man motive was a romance anime going into the show, I could see a drop to a 5 though. \\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi Review (Tagged SPOILERS ramble only at the end of the review)\r\nIntroduction\r\n\t Acchi Kocchi is a slice of life school romcom where romance means \"unspoken love\".\r\nMusic\r\n \tOP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bMjtNnsA6Y\r\n\tThe opening is Acchi de Kocchi de or Over There, Over Here. It's sung by the main characters of the anime and it's one of the cutest anime openings in existence. If you don't smile while listening to it you have no soul.\r\n\t ED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hxxgf7lIIc\r\n\tThe ending is Te o Gyu Shite ne or Grasp My Hand. It's sung by Rumi Ookubo who voices Miniwa. It's a solo song and like the beginning opening it's cute as heck.The voice actor has a very pretty voice in the endearing sense. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. While it's not the best ending, I love it. I would sit and listen to it at the end of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation is very cute. The backgrounds and foregrounds are charming, simple and are ultimately just a means to make the main characters stand out more. All the characters are cute, unique and colourful. I love them all. They're almost chibi and sometimes even drawn in chibi for certain moments. The show uses the familiar spirals, blue lines, floral patterns and bubbles type backdrops to denote the characters moods along with their expressions. Both main characters have \"ahoge\" or hair antennae. Miniwa has cat ears and a tail sometimes, which is never addressed or explained as I recall. : - )\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n        Io Otonashi: Glasses, intelligent (OBVIOUSLY; HE HAS GLASSES) inspiration to all gentleman.\\n\r\nThe difference between Otonashi and the generic male lead is he's so smart he knows she loves him the whole time and you see the reasons why he chooses not to confess. It's not because he doesn't want to ruin what they have, it's because he's happy with the way things are. Them being in love. Her loving him. Him knowing it and loving her back.\\n\r\n       Tsukimi Miniwa: Loli, runner for cutest anime character ever, shy, a bit dumb sometimes.\\n\r\nI love this character more than my own mother, which is saying a lot. Tsumiki Miniwa is quite possibly THE cutest anime girl. A girl as cute as her doesn't even need to be endearing, but she is. How she acts, around Otonashi especially, will make you love her even more. She's willing to go to amazing lengths just for him. In the words of How I Met Your Mother she's a \"dobler\". At times she's the very definition of doing and thinking crazy, fanatical things but coming off as charming.\\n\r\n\"The Dobler-Domer theory: If both parties like each other mutually, a romantic gesture becomes 'charming,' but if only one person likes the other, the same romantic gesture becomes 'creepy'\"\\n\r\n        The rest of the main characters: Hime Haruno, Mayoi Katase and Sakaki Inui are Otonashi and Miniwa's friends (no love triangles here(THANK GOD)). They're there for comedy and some side plot. Each of them is wonderful. Hime is there to say dumb things and nosebleed at all the ridiculous cute things Miniwa does, Mayoi is there for crazy klutz comedy, and Sakaki is there to be Otonashi's a little bit pervy joking friend, while Otonashi himself is the straight man. That's one thing I have to applaud the show for doing; taking 5 characters, making them loveable and a valuable part to the show, and not adding anymore. The formula is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\n\tBeing told over years of the character's high school lives and being a slice of life and romance anime; you pretty much know what you're getting. School life, cooking, sports, snowball fights, cleaning the pool, mountain vacation, summer festival, school festival, christmas, new years, valentines, white day, and a bunch of shenanigans in between. Just teenagers having fun in their daily lives and their relationships with each other. Some of the story has to do with Otonashi and Miniwa's unspoken love. Usually when her and Otonashi are together Miniwa has these thought bubble cutscenes that play through her mind of what she wants to do with Otonashi. Quite often something like holding his hand and in her head she's saying \"Just hold his hand. TAKE INITIATIVE.\" it drives a lot of the scenes into her getting flustered. It's the endearing part I was talking about. It also made me think long and hard about what shy girls might be thinking when I'm not taking the initiative. :P\\n\\n\r\nNegatives/Positives\\n\\n\r\n\tTo me this anime is flawless. There are no negatives at all. And there are more than enough positives to add up to a 10/10 in all I've mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\n\tAcchi Kocchi is one of the greatest anime of all time. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS BELOW\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS:\\n\r\n_____\\n\r\nBest moment of Acchi Kocchi, why Otonashi is so amazing, why his and Miniwa's love is so amazing, and why I think the ending was perfect:\\n\r\n        The best series of moments in the anime is the ones where she's waiting outside in the cold for him PRETENDING TO BUMP INTO HIM every morning so they can walk to school together. At one point he's late you see him run up to where she's still waiting despite him being late and he says \"sorry for making you wait\" and she blushes embarassed he knew she had been waiting for him every day. It is THE MOST heartwarming romance I've ever seen. Enough to warm my whole body in the cold of winter. The whole anime has the main characters Otonashi and Miniwa caring for each other in a show of love stronger than any other school-life romance anime I've seen. Otonashi is the very definition of a gentleman, letting Tsumiki take their relationship at her own pace. This man's patience is ridiculous. AND HE'S PERFECT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ANIME. NO DRAMA. And always says the right thing to put Miniwa's anxious worries to rest. He's an inspiration. They don't even call each other by their first names for the majority of the anime! But when they reach that relationship milestone and she FINALLY calls him Io and he calls her Tsumiki. It makes you feel good for years. I feel good thinking about it now. After tagging along with this group of high school students there's an indeterminate end, like most anime. It ends on an episode that's just like any other. You don't know if they ever date, or get married. But to me, unlike other anime where you're mad they haven't confessed, it was the perfect ending. You know they love each other. You know they'll be together forever. And for goodness sake they're still young. They don't need to rush into anything!\\n",

            "content": "I don't consider myself a hipster (I don't have enough of a social life, plus I have a cowboy hat instead of a fedora), but there are quite a few popular anime (and other media) that I don't like. Most of the time I can understand their popularity (SAO is an energetic battle shonen romp that appeals strongly to all the gamers; Nisekoi appeals to those of us who can't get enough of love dodecahedrons, and features Shinbo and co. dressing things up with Shaft eye candy; Kiniro Mosaic can ease the stress of a long day at work or school with good clean yuricooing).\\n\\n\r\nAcchi Kocchi, meanwhile, is one of those rare, brain-damaged birds whose popularity I just don't get. I mentioned Nisekoi above. One could argue that such a bland, paint-by-numbers romcom setup NEEDED the Mado/gatari team behind it to offset the insipid story. Meanwhile with Acchi Kocchi we go almost as far as physically possible in the opposite direction, with chibi mode seemingly being the main appearance of the characters; when extra humor is called for, they practically turn into plastic board game pieces, with possibly less definition than your average chess piece. The rest of the artwork isn't much better, with the background being absent for what seems like half the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the story... I called Nisekoi insipid? Acchi Kocchi makes that look like quantum mechanics. ...Okay, it is rather unique to have a shy couple already an item without any drama. But that's the problem. There is almost no drama in this show. Jerry Seinfeld was wrong; slice-of-shows aren't completely about nothing. Each episode of those shows, or one of the in-episode sketches, has a character working toward some goal, however small (ie Osaka in Azumanga Daioh trying to find a hiccup cure; Renge in Non Non Biyori learning to ride a bike). With Acchi Kocchi, most scenes are simply based on a shy boy and girl trying to talk to each other or sneak off only to be interrupted by their one-note, brutally loud \"friends\" who seem to have been designed based on Wacky Waving Arm-Flailing Inflatable Tube Men and desperately want to watch them make out. Of course, as boy and girl are one-note kuuderes, not even the hardest liquor in Gen Urobuchi's cabinet could convince me that these two could ever so much as hold hands. Except for the WWAFITM's mentioned above, the cast, the general mood, heck, even the BGM all seem to be on extra-strength Valium. Coupled with the bargain-basement animation and character design, Acchi Kocchi almost seems more like one of those five-minute kiddie productions instead of a prime-time television anime. Yes, Kiniro Mosaic's general shtick isn't much better, but at least they put a little more effort into character design and artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I really don't get why this bit of...sloth is so highly rated and regarded. Between it, Kiniro Mosaic, and SAO, it makes me a bit worried for the future of Japanese animation.",

There isn't really much of a storyline, but is made up of alot of small and funny sketches based around one whole premise, much like shows such as Seitokai no Ichizon and Seitokai Yakuindomo. \r\nCharacters are slowly developed, and you can expect to slowly learnabout each of their personalities and traits. \\n\r\nThe entire series has been an enjoyable experience, perfect for those looking for a relaxing and funny anime series.\\n\r\nA great slice of life comedy, with a hint of romance, so if you're into school-life rom-coms, why not go and check this out?",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is an unique anime that blends romantic comedy and slice of life really well. It folds around a group of five high schoolers who live in an everyday life full of activities and surprises. The story mainly focuses between the two main characters of the series, Tsumiki and Io, and their close and embarrassing moments together.\r\nStory --- 8\r\nAcchi Kocchi is an episodic show. It doesn't follow a main objective unlike other anime. It focuses on the gang's humorous excursions and activities that they make out of their everyday lives.\r\nArt --- 9\r\nThe art is vividly cute and light hearted giving the audience a cuteand joyful floating feeling. It's really simple and wonderfully presented. You wouldn't get bored and gloomy with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound --- 9\\n\r\nThe sound used and presented are accurately displayed. The character voices are assigned properly. The music used really blends with the mood of the scene depicted. Both the art and music really coordinates and blends well with each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter --- 8\\n\r\nThe characters depicted are pretty much clich\u00e9s in today's standard. We have the two focused main characters: Io, a blockhead who's oblivious to love and Tsumiki, a tsundere. Character development is also really slow but that's what makes it enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment --- 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series. It really has good sense of humor blending slice of life references. It reminds me of the fun times I have with my friends and the pranks that we made.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a rating of 8.  The series never fails to amuse me with their slapstick romantic comedy. If you want to watch some cute characters revolving some mishaps and comedic trials then give Acchi Kocchi a  try.",

            "content": "Anime Review No.13\r\nAcchi Kochi is your \u201cTypical\u201d school romcom anime series that revolves around the male and female protagonist Otonashi, Io and Miniwa, Tsumiki which both have an eye for each other but too \u201cembarrass\u201d to admit or tell each other\u2019s feelings even it is so obvious among their friends and also to each other but still afraid to break the boundaries of being just friends than something more higher level of relationship. The anime looks promising? To tell you the truth it\u2019s not \u201cif\u201d you watch a dozen of this type of series which just follow the same formula over and over again youwill find this anime boring and will just watch for the \u201cmoe\u201d character design and \u201cmoe service\u201d if not and you are just a beginner of this type of series well I think you might actually like it especially you have \u201cneko loli taste\u201d.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Excuse why this anime is not even pass my average rating.\\n\\n\r\nPlot ( 4/10) \u201cSpoilers Incoming\u201d\\n\r\nThe Anime will solely focus on the comedy to build up the romance which how school romcom anime works but instead of me laughing for the comedy I just end up just getting \u201cmoe service\u201d. A comedy which is just met to make the characters cuter when they became clumsy there is psychological term use in this kind of method modern anime is pulling from but I won\u2019t tell it yet as I made more review feel free to spot the term. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for an explanation how and when the heroine had a crush towards our male protagonist the anime won\u2019t explain it and there is no flashbacks to prove it! Seems like the feeling of Tsumiki is already program or something making the crush thing less believable and that\u2019s the plot\u2019s fault for not explaining it. \\n\r\nAnother notorious comedy slap the anime is always hurting its character for comedic purposes which make it annoying and less in morals. Hitting and hurting your friends is not funny in the most common sense you\u2019re a sadist if you found this often use jokes very funny. I am not claiming it\u2019s bad but using it on every episode all the time will became dull very fast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10) nothing different\\n\\n\r\nLet me summarize the characters\\n\r\nTsumiki- The neko loli girl which have a crush on the male protagonist. Act\u2019s cute every time his near to the guy he likes and act like a emotionless girl towards her friends. Not a likable character you will just like her look and neko like behavior but not her actual personality because she is deviant in nature. \\n\\n\r\nOtonashi- Mark as the perfect guy in the series and love by many girls with his cool personality and perfectionist in much activity even he doesn\u2019t even try. A \u201cBeta Male\u201d in short and I will tell how many kind of this male exists in modern anime. No wonder the heroine have a crush because he\u2019s the perfect guy! Not a likable character more like you\u2019re over use type of male characters as the leading star.\\n\r\nHime- just your average loli side character nothing special here.\\n\\n\r\nMayoi and Inui- your common idiotic friends that are just there to make the gang alive by their mischievous plans for their friends which also the real characters who make the plot! But still their personality is also the same with other school romcom.\\n\r\nAs far that\u2019s the only character worth mentioning others? Well nothing much about them I have already forgets them while I am making this preview.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts about the entire cast\\n\r\n- Character Development 0! Nothing changes in the span of 12 episodes the characters are what they are from the beginning of the episode 1.  Even the romance didn\u2019t happen is there a kiss? No! Did they become a couple? No! Is their relationship is different from before? NO! So what did I get? nothing! It all end up making me imagine what can be the outcome of the event. Not rewarding and more like time waster! If you guys looking for character depth and development and especially relationship progress I say you guys to stay away! Not even the moment of saying I love you is even presented just to say the anime is romance. No sir! This anime is a big fat lie in terms of romance! \\n\\n\r\nMusic and Soundtrack (4/10) nothing special\\n\r\nI won\u2019t criticizes the music department because they did what it should but still nothing amusing or special about it. It\u2019s plain forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nDesign and Artwork (5/10) The only average\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look mutation of kinder garners or grade school students that was drop in a high school setting and they even act like one in a high school setting which is very superficial. High School student don\u2019t act like silly kids even they did not as much making themselves pure idiots. I will accept if they were middle school but \u201cHigh School\u201d you can\u2019t be kidding right? Once logic take place even the \u201cMoe Service Excuse is damn stupid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\r\nI won\u2019t lie I did enjoy the \u201cmoe service\u201d for just 2 episodes but once the comedy is repeating  over and over again it\u2019s get boring. I my personal comment just \u201cmeh\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10) Mediocre \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not totally bad but if you watch so many school romcom you will understand why I became bored if you have watched less anime genres like this you will actually find the humor fresh and enjoyable sadly I don\u2019t see this so please understand. I won\u2019t recommend this show since all modern anime is using this kind of gimmick so yeah the anime is not original nor unique nor even faithful one what it present. This is just \u201canother\u201d generic school comedy series that fools you in believing an actual romance progression will took place and I am not lying when I say this. Watch this anime at your own risk! \\n\\n\r\nI hope my review will be helpful is saving your time in watching better anime titles than Acchi Kochi.\\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is a very simple slice of life anime. Don't expect a lot plot because it's almost non existent in this show. It's a show about a group of 5 friends just interacting with each other and living their student lives/ The show however do focus more on the relationship between our two lovers Tsumiki Miniwa and Otonashi Io.  Tsumiki the main heroine is a kitten-like-sometimes-tsundere-cute-girl who is shy about showing her true feelings to Io (the silent type, perfect and cool guy who always looks after Tsumiki). Their feelings for each other are kinda obvious early on (Tsumiki's shyness and Io beingdense are what holds them back from being real lovers) and it just kinds of develop throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are okay, they consistently show up and have substantial amount of screen time each episode (specially the 3 other members of the group). Mayoi Katase the resident mad scientist will give you good laughs by her weird and funny behavior and her equally outrageous inventions, Inui Sakaki the other male in the group is kinda your typical male character, a pervert who loves challenging Io to games and lastly Haruno Hime the nose bleeding loyal supporter who just can't get enough of Io and Tsumiki's cute relationship. Don't expect a lot from this show, it's a slice-of-life romance comedy (with very light plot, almost the same things happen each episode) that'll give you some laughs here and there and if you dig the romance between Io and Tsumiki you'll enjoy this. If you don't like light romance better avoid this because the comedy isn't that plentiful and you might find yourself bored for some stretches of this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Rating: 7/10",

They're all in high school now, thinking of their future and who they want to be. Of course, they don't really make that the main thing about it.\r\nBut let's get to the point here.\r\nThis anime is all about romance, let's admit that.\r\nThe whole reason why they're all there is because of those two characters thatwanna bond together.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, like any other cliche romance, the girl is usually the one who is deeply in love.\\n\\n\r\nNow, in this anime, it may give you clues about how the guy feels but... you can never be so sure, sadly.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an anime that makes you all happy, makes you laugh horribly, and makes you smile intensely.\\n\\n\r\nIt should, anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI love everything about this anime except for one thing....\\n\\n\r\nI know that many people might not mind like I do, but this is a personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not very fond of the pace.\\n\\n\r\nYou know those shows where the WHOLE thing is all about how they meet and how they try to confess and all that and it takes maybe three seasons for them to finally notice each other or something?\\n\\n\r\nAnd you know those shows where you suffer with something like that and when they finally admit they love each other and they become a couple...\\n\\n\r\nThe show ends?\\n\\n\r\nYES, I HATE THAT TOO!\\n\\n\r\nImagine, just suffering through the whole thing, and then in the end they don't even show the development... even though that was really all we damn wanted...\\n\\n\r\nI mean, this anime, you can deal with it.\\n\r\nThe whole process is very adorable and sometimes you're happy that it doesn't end.\\n\\n\r\nBut you have to admit...

            "content": "Place-to-place. Its title speak for itself.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIt is a series that is not focused on a particular story, there is random plot,\r\nas what it portrays, one episode is composed of 2 sets of random stories in which tells how the characters interact with each other and their environment. In the story, there are no elements of a plot, no climax, no denouement, no rising action it was just laid out there as it was told in a straightforward yet refreshing manner with a dose of comedy and moe-ness aboard.This anime truly sparks in how it delivers. The story's random as the plot may seem, theway it delivers the story makes up for the comedy was well thought of,  and the number strongest weapon would be the moe element\\n\r\nthe romance might just be a part of the moe factor.\\n\\n\r\nI rated it as 7 since there is no definite story in it, but since deliverance is well thought of and the comedy is consistent it makes up for what the anime lacks. I subtracted 3 pts since it doesn't really deliver a strong emotional impact except for comedy and moe. it is just a normal story of normal lives which is actually interesting and well laid out that totally deserve the much bigger side of the coin.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, a well-made story should have made the impact of bringing charm to viewers, for example, ideologies or arguments that the viewers might realize while watching the film, but since the story is made to be random, or made to be for moe and comedic purposes, the value one might get in it is  can be taken its comedic verses and simple dialogs and not really in the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not your average story, it was artistically made, in a way that it can entertain and give you laughing points to ponder in its randomness. A  lighthearted slice of life story that doesn't have a plot line yet it is capable of giving a good laugh and feels in its randomness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave the animation a perfect score since it was simple and light, the characters are made to be in chibiforms it was not too colorful nor too dull, it was well balance and gives off the perfect atmosphere for the show.\\n\r\n in its simplicity comes its beauty, the characters are drawn in a way that not too detailed yet would actually stand out, it is not the normal ones which makes you give the boorring vibe, it is drawn in way you can be entertained just by looking at them the artistic elements of lines and arrows, the concept of fore ground and background and the light hues definetely gives of a good balance in animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a perfect score since the quality of sound definitely complements the animation. as much as the art is well balanced and smooth, the voice actors did an awesome job in voicing the characters. The tone value totally contributes in the moe feeling, it makes use of slangs portrayed in the cutest way possible.\\n\r\nthe opening and ending song totally suits the anime, i believe the opening theme was sung by tsumiki's and io's voice actors. The opening song totally gives you the opening feeling for the show, and the ending song is perfect in terms of toning everything down.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI gave it an 7 since each of the character presented in the story are all gives off their own charm. It is because of the character's built archetypes and personalities that brings about the colors of the anime. The story, in its essence is presented in an almost straightforward manner that it might have been too boring if there are bland characters.  Each character presents its own interesting and lively side of them that brings about the fun in the series as well as give us an enough dose of laugh about  randomness in their crazy mannerisms and ideologies. It is in its characters that the show wins its points but then at the same time, it is not perfect in its bravado nature. The characters lack depth and development. Just as the show entirely advocate their fun by means of randomness and moe comedy, the characters are not set to the path of developing and nurturing change in personality as the series progresses. In their personas, the characters in the series lack the very essence of being a character, if the characters would be the trees, it could be said that they lack roots that are planted steadily in the ground. The characters are charming at most parts, but they can have a pint of imperfection in them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIs it just me?  Because if you ask me what have I gained most of this show , I would say it is enjoyment. This show might just be simply made for fun and entertainment purposes and not so much on becoming a deep drama story about rescuing nakamas and fighting villains in all their wickedness in all its ideology, philosophy, and psychology in it. I had a great laugh and have a great deal of butterflies floating in my stomach and electric shock coming every now and then. This show is a real gem in comedy, as well as randomness. The art and sound I can say, is original and simple which can also contribute to the enjoyment factor. The characters are very entertaining in their own way, one would never get bored of alternately dealing with each character. One thing would suddenly pop up and become funny before you know it, you are laughing and getting the feels as the episode was already wrapping up. I enjoyed it much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: would be the value of the average of all the scores added up. \\n\\n\\n",

But boy was I wrong.\r\nThe show is definitely cute, and refreshing to watch. The jokes aren't cringy and just lame puns (OK some are) that goes very well along with the simple, fun tone the show has.\r\nThe plot is simple (justlikeanyothersliceoflifeanime) so you could understand it even with an extra chromosome.\r\nSidenote by the way: If you're planing to watch this show, makesure to turn of at least 25% of your total brain cells, and enjoy the \"hnggg\"",

            "content": "Oh my. You have no idea how many times I died watching this series. Its tooooo cute! Its tooo moe!! I FREAKIN\u2019 LOVE IT!!!\r\nAcchi Kocchi was indeed a shocker. The story follows the everyday life of Tsumiki and her very dense yet really kind crush, Io, along with their fellow classmates and peers. This anime is a simple highschool anime that has slice-of-life, comedy, a bit of romance & a gallon full of cuteness under its belt. I was expecting this to be the typical ones that we usually see nowadays, but oh boy I\u2019m wrong. The level of comedy in this anime doesn\u2019t reachthe heights of Konosuba or Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun, but its more subtle and easy to digest on. What made it funny is the fact that their jokes were really mundane and it could definitely happen in real life, insert the slice-of-life elements of the series. They do exaggerate the reactions to the circumstances, still, the level of relatability is sky high. Well, this is just my opinion though.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this series really fun to watch was the characters and their cutene\u2013I mean\u2026their interactions with each other. They are definitely highschool kids, they act like one, they enjoy their school life like one. Except for the \u2018simple\u2019 traits like Tsumiki\u2019s cat-like appearance or Mayoi\u2019s prowess in technology, all the characters are very close to a human beings in real life. I really want to point out how amazing the relationships of the characters are with one another. Each one of them compliments and even counteract conversations and arguments with one another. I LOVE THAT. I can\u2019t help but smile in everything they do.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that made me really really like this series is the fact that THEY ARE FREAKIN\u2019 CUTE!!! AND MOE!! Oh Mhay Ghad!!! This series is ssooooooo ccccuuuutttteee! Damn, I\u2019m getting diabetes watching this show. Theart & animation is soooo my type. I really really like the art of the series, its so consistent and the color palette all through out the series was soothing in the eyes. It never bored me. The animation though. Dunno if its because my copy is a BD but damn its soooooo consistent and rich\u2026I can\u2019t. The animation could go head to head with any animes in the same genre, and damn Acchi Kocchi would still win. Its that gooooooooddddd.\\n\\n\r\nThe music & sound is also cute very fitting to the series. The OP was sung by the casts. I am not much of a fun of songs like this (sang by the casts) but damn this OP sure is hella cute, but I am also sure I don\u2019t want this to be on repeat on my phone. The ED was\u2026cute\u2026but not my type of ED song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series gave me life. The level of cuteness, and lightheartedness could give anyone a disease. A disease of happiness\u2026for days. Its a must watch on my book. This anime is recommended to people who likes to watch animes with the elements of moe, school theme, slice-of-life, subtle comedy, and a pinch of romance. This anime doesn\u2019t disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, that is all folks.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!!",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi represents a critical dilemma within me. I love (more than I would care to admit) romantic comedies, yet I place a very large emphasis on a strong plot. For those who have watched other similar rom-coms, you most likely understand why this can be a problem. Most shows of this nature (barring a small number of rare exceptions) have absolutely no story, and rather try to create entertaining character interactions and poignant scenes to fill the void. This sometimes works, but often times the result is so bland, so boring, and so contrived, that it leaves you with a sour taste in yourmouth. Unfortunately, this is exactly how I would describe the trainwreck that is Acchi Kocchi, or Place to Place.\\n\\n\r\nKnow that this review is coming from an avid consumer of mediocre high school rom-coms, so when I say this show is bad, it's really bad. To detail my distaste for this  anime's story, there will be one paragraph containing minor spoilers. I don't think anyone should put themselves through the hell that is this show, but if you are for some reason interested in the show, skip the second paragraph of the story section.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, many, if not most rom-coms look to crafting quirky and/or funny interactions between its characters to substitute for a lack of plot. Acchi Kocchi definitely attempts to do this, but given the cookie-cutter cast of walking anime tropes, any conversations between characters can only be seen as drab, and boring. The pace is slow, and the episodes drag on as they go. Every adventure that the characters go on has been done in practically every other \\n\\n\r\nThe next section contains minor \"spoilers\" so you can skip it if you'd like. There isn't anything even mildly unique in the story, so if you've been exposed to any sort of romantic media at all, you can definitely guess the plot, so it shouldn't be a problem. But if you still don't want any \"spoilers\", you can skip the next section. I apologize if this takes up a majority of the story section.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 ** MINOR SPOILERS**\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem that I had with the story of Acchi Kocchi was the romantic build-up, and then the absolute lack of payoff. You can read the synopsis, but the first eleven episodes essentially portrays romance growing between the two protagonists, to the extent that it's pretty blatantly shown that they both like each other. Mind you there is one episodes left. NOTHING HAPPENS IN THE LAST EPISODE. Anyone with a brain would expect to see some sort of confession, some sort of declaration of love, anything. Even the worst of rom-coms have the common sense to have this payoff. Somehow the writers thought it would be a good idea to destroy the (albeit minimal) momentum that they had built. The last episode acts as  if the characters were normal platonic classmates. This was probably the most infuriating ending that I've watched of any anime. I cannot imagine any competent person writing the garbage that was the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I had with the story were the side-characters. There were two characters in particular that had a romance of their own building up. This may just be me reading between the lines too much, but there were a number of signs showing that the writers were trying to create said romance, yet there was  still no payoff whatsoever. They remained platonic friends till the end. This had the potential to be really good relationship, but in their usual incompetency. The writers did absolutely nothing to make the relationship tangible.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                         **END SPOILERS**\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story sucks. It in itself is a reason not to watch the show. The only reason that I give it a three is because of 1) The minimal buildup of the first 11 episodes 2) there were very few funny moments, but when they were funny they were really funny.\\n\\n\r\nART - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as the score describes  it. There isn't anything good about it, it's  just average. Call me nitpicky, but I thought it was pretty odd how Miniwa's hair literally changed colors randomly. Sometimes it was blue, sometimes it was indigo. I also don't understand the design of Mayoi. While I know it's pretty standard to have character's whose eyes you can't see, I still dislike the idea.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is average, the sound is just a bit below average. While I thoroughly enjoy OPs and EDs sung by the cast, this one wasn't done very well. The seiyuus didn't sing well, and it sounded extremely childish. There isn't a single OST track that stuck with me, and I'd be hard-pressed to name one that was particularly fitting for the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, all of the characters followed a common trope. Miniwa was the tsundere, Io was the nerdy yet somehow palpitation-inducing protagonist, Mayoi was the genki girl who tried to set up Miniwa and Io, Hime was the klutsy, yet endearing girl. Sakaki was Friend A. You get the point. While following these cliches doesn't necessitate characters devoid of personality, they unfortunately ended up as such. No one had a shred of characterization, and all of the reactions, conversations, and jokes could have been predicted twenty minutes prior.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm extremely critical of this show, I can't say that I didn't enjoy it all. Like I said earlier, I'm an avid consumer of rom-coms, whether I like it or not. I still felt a slight (emphasis on slight) tug at the heart during romantic moments between Miniwa and Io, and I still chuckled (not a full laugh, just a chuckle) at the funny moments. The ending sucked out my soul, and made me hate the show, but the first eleven episodes were good enough to make me feel the standard set of emotions when watching rom-coms. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of bad things about Acchi Kocchi. A lot. I could never recommend this anime with good conscious, but I still have to acknowledge that there isn't NOTHING that's good. The main shortcoming of the show is it's disgusting ending, and complete lack of uniqueness. But, those like me who thoroughly school rom-coms can still gain something (but not very much at all) from watching the show. It still pulls off the standard events with subpar proficiency.\\n\\n\r\n This show is bad, no doubt about it. I would have been better off not watching it, and I hope that as few people as possible have to suffer the tragedy that is the ending. Do not watch this show. Please. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

A lot of blood was lost through the nose during this anime though, sometimes for no good reason, but at least the cause was always some girls getting excited over romantic lines.\r\nAlthough the characters can be a bit predictable theyform a good mix of personalities. These main characters never really change throughout the series nor are any background stories ever revealed. The cast does grow occasionally but those people don't reappear very often. What does seem to grow is the bond between the male and female protagonist but I would have liked to see it go a little bit further. (hopefully in a next season)\\n\\n\r\nThe music, sound and animations were all very modern with style switches for comedy or thoughts and graphical designs between different scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Acchi Kocchi is an anime I would recommend to all who like school life romance mixed with some good slapstick comedy.",

            "content": "More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet\r\n-----------------------------\r\nWhen I was talking about anime with a friend on Steam, he brought up the anime Acchi Kocchi. He recommended it for various reasons, the tsundere heroine being the main one. And with that, I sat back and got myself ready to watch some rom-com, even if I did have a bit of trouble to start off.\r\nStory\r\nThere isn't really much of a story for Acchi Kocchi. The heroine, Tsumiki, is in love with a guy called Io, but can't spit it out. Io is oblivious to her feelings. That's pretty much all there is toit.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as this anime goes, it's a rom-com slice of life, and I personally don't do well with slice of life anime. I find them to be somewhat slow and difficult to concentrate on.\\n\\n\r\nThe major highlight, besides the interesting relationship Tsumiki and Io have, is by far the comedy. Every episode had me laughing several times, even when I was in a terrible mood, and the supporting characters are often the source of this, whether it be Mayoi's crazy inventions or Sakaki's games.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show seemed smooth and well done, especially regarding the games in the earlier episodes. Acchi Kocchi made Kick the Can unepectedly awesome; however, outside of the over-the-top games, there was nothing really special about the animation, at least not to me. It at least reaches the current animation status.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe BGMs for me were nothing too notable, but the opening will get stuck in your head if you listen to it too long; it's energetic and random, fitting with the anime's nature. The ending, like the BGM, was nothing too special and the voice actors suited their roles relatively nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhat really made this anime enjoyable were the characters. Tsumiki, in particular, was indeed one of the highlights, as she's mostly on the 'dere' side of the \"tsundere\" character type. Whenever she and Io were having a moment, it was adorable, but not too much so.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite character, however, has to be Sakaki. His antics were always fun to watch, and his reactions in general were one of the better parts of the show for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Acchi Kocchi was a lot of fun to watch, and more or less met my expectations, if not surpassed them. I would recommend it exactly how I recommended K-On!: this anime would be a nice way to relax after a shounen action, and the comedy will wipe away your bad mood. At least, it did for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5.2\\n\r\nAnimation - 7.5\\n\r\nSound - 7.1\\n\r\nCharacters - 8.2\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.0\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE - 7.2/10",

I don't want to spoil anything so if you don't know how a typical romcom is go watch a few, you'll understand hopefully. There really isn't a strong story in the series but I found myself enjoying each episode.\r\nArt 10: This is completely opinionated. I love anime with this type of art style,each female character was so adorable, male characters were really cool, setting was nice and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10: Liked both op and ed, background music really fit the the setting and genre of the show. No complaints :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9: All the characters were really unique. No one was bland or boring in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: Like I said before I really love this series. Have re watched this series on multiple occasions and enjoyed it with every watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: The show is really good in my opinion. If you like slice of life shows and cute romance then this is worth a watch. If you don't like those types of genre I would still tell you to watch this.",

Main boy still feels and treats main girl the same. They're still just friends at the end despite knowing they like each other (at least mainboy knows).\\n\r\nI enjoyed the fast paced unnecessary action sequences, all the jokes landed for me even the repetitive ones. The format of the show was cute as well as all the transitions. I liked all the character designs and interactions. There's so much to like but I feel so unsatisfied it's keeping me from ranking it any higher.\\n\r\nThe opening and closing also didn't do anything for me.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the show would have been so much better for me if they confirmed the relationship in some way.

Add in some wacky side characters, and that's pretty much what this show is.  I guess you could call this \"moe\" too btw.  Because of this, i can already tell you that it's not gonna be for everyone.   My only real flaw with this one, is that, like most others of this genre, there is no closure.  The MCdoesn't confess, or anything like that. I would have loved to see that. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if any of that hasn't turned you away, then i say give it a try!",

It wasn't the best, but yes I like it.",

I loved the scene when Io picks up Tsumiki in the photo booth. And it had many jokes I found amusing, like when they all go to theshrines. \\n\\n\r\nAnd they all wish for each other wishes to come true, and Io breaks the links by saying he wishes that Sakaoi DOES NOT come true. I died laughing on that part.\\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness, it was a cute anime. It had a cute childish theme to it. ;) I give it 8 out of 10",

The series has 12 eps and finished airing in the end of Spring 2012, an OVA also added~well you should watch all of 'em! highly recommended.\r\n    Even said it's highly recommended and got quite high popularity on MAL, maybe some guys who don't into romance thingy won't pick this one. But, well, once again don't judge a book by its cover. The romance isn't anything like another romance. Some says it's romanticcomedy, the romance is just an added flavour but the focus of the story still the comedy itself.\\n\\n\r\n    As wikipedia says of its plot, \"The serious-minded Io and the pure-hearted Tsumiki feel they never want to be parted, but haven't become a couple yet. More than friends but less than lovers, they develop an awkward quasi-romance.\" The series does have an interesting couple between the main hero and heroine like they're so close and get the fire burning their chests or instantly reddening their faces. So warm-hearted when the circumstances and their classmates promote the jokes. The jokes are around their daily activities as the students, sometimes the place takes in other places such as shopping district and other friend's houses. The art is so cute~err how should I put it~the animation uses brighter colours, and colourful, please to be seen.\\n\\n\r\n    Described about the characters, plot and it's animation. So let's jump to the music. The OP and ED theme aren't the type of songs I will put on my playlist but it's not because the themes are bad but it's funnier to listen it when you watch the series. The scenes which appears along the OP and ED are fancy to the songs. So it's a bit off when just listen to it separately.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI gave 9+ rate personally, the enjoyment really boosts the series.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nNice art, mixed moe and funny  scenes for the plot\\n\r\nJokes and varying character\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nHmmm... Lemme think what needs to mention as cons",

Although the characters are a bit cliche at times,  Acchi Kocchi still finds a way to be original and funny. The show has your typical tsundere female student who is devoted to the clueless fellow male classmate. Along with klutzy airhead friends who do nothing but cause trouble. \r\nAK has plenty of adorable nose bleed moments in it, however it does not have any ecchi based nose bleeds. Whether that is a good thing or not dependson your personal tastes I guess. I do love how Tsumiki is portrayed often times as a cat by showing her with cat ears and tail. Somehow it just makes her character all the more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I gave this series a 9/10 it was amazing in almost every area one look for in a good anime, but I personally would have liked their relationship to progress a little more than it did.",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is a relatively light (and very slow) series about the daily life of a group of friends. This character-based comedy offers minimal plot, focusing rather on interesting life snapshots in a similar fashion to Nichijou. I wouldn't say this is exactly a Lucky Star as, while the characters are supposed to be moe, over half of the comedic elements focus around the cat-girl Tsumiki and her unrequited love for Io. It's a decent show to watch when overly bored but as the series is literally all over the place, don't expect to actually end up anywhere.\r\nAnimation:\r\nI'm not a big fan of the overly-cartoonishdrawing style but this does not necessarily a doom a series (as proven by Nichijou). The characters themselves remind me of those from other series for some reason. For instance, Hime reminds me of Haruna from Kore wa Zombie Desuka (think ED) and Sakaki reminds me of Souma from Working!. Similarities aside, the girls in this series have some serious hanaji issues whenever thinking of Io. Overall, I just can't see the characters as high school students as their drawing style makes them look more like elementary students.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some odd action scenes though nothing in comparison to the overly dramatized scenes in Nichijou. For me, the most standout characteristic for this series is the scene transition frames, which are both simplistic yet thoughtful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP sounds like an overly tuned-down version of the Nichijou songs, which just makes it both melodically weird and generally not very good. The ED is a better melody with Tsumiki's voice giving it a cute overtone. There are also some nice piano/instrumental pieces in the BGM though overall the sound effects are more distinct.\\n\\n\r\nTsumiki's VA is perfect for her personality, though the others were all average. I really wished Io had more of a personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThis is a character-driven show so the only real \"plot\" train is the passage of time. The show takes plice in an ordinary town with ordinary people (who are drawn without faces). You get lots of typical scenes including school festivals, Christmas cake selling, and Valentines day. As with other pure slice-of-life shows, don't expect much tension or excitement from the overall story. However, unlike other slice of life shows, this one fails to distinguish itself in any way other than being \"ordinary\". Humor-wise, there were a few chuckles but nothing all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a mixed bag as well. If you're okay with watching a bunch of distinct characters interact, then this might be good. If you're looking for a series with character development and relationship tensions, this is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Io, a rather quiet and understated (though talented) lead; Tsumiki, a tsundere girl who grows cat elements (probably figuratively) when thinking of Io; and a bunch of other friends, who constantly make fun of the fact that Tsumiki can't confess her feelings and that Io never catches on to Tsumiki's indirect approaches. While the Tsumiki/Io relationship is cute, it never really takes off.\\n\\n\r\nThus I really question the seinin tag as many of the antics and personalities feel like they're more appropriate for younger audiences; I was outright bored with the antics of Hime and Mayoi. While some of the interactions were fun, most of them just seemed overly childish.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nI picked up this series on the belief that the slight distance between Io/Tsumiki would make for some interesting tension. Alas there was virtually none. This is a mellow show with a mellow mood, and now a mellow review rating. Perhaps this is what a slice of life is actually supposed to be like, but without any actual movement plot-wise or character-wise, and without any memorable comedic moments, I just can't see the value in this unless you just want to see moe characters. Nichijou uses a similar comic-book style but has many more interesting and comedic moments.",

            "content": "Alright, let's start with pros.\r\nIt's kinda cute the first couple episodes.\r\nNow that we're done with pros, let's talk about cons.\r\nEvery episode is the same, characters are one-dimensional, they follow a pattern all the time and never change - almost like a >>robotthey just decided to make her a little bit more dorky than Tsumiki and be done with it. That being said, Hime has no point at being in the show at all, if you replace her in your mind with a tree or a rock, you won't notice any difference in character.\\n\r\nNow back to Tsumiki. Tsumiki sometimes has cat ears and other times not. I think that's supposed to make her more cute, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's some other meaning to it, feel free to educate me on that matter. Oh and she's in love with Io. Did I mention she's supposed to be cute? Yeah, that's Tsumiki for you.\\n\r\nLet's move onto next character. Io is a high-schooler with mind of a very smart, talkative 30-year old. Seriously, the stuff he says isn't something a high-schooler would ever think of. Oh and apparently he's tall. That's all there is to him and that makes him very attractive for all the chicks no matter their age. Every time he says something \"smart\", Hime and Tsumiki get wet (they start bleeding from their noses). \\n\r\nMayoi and Sakaki are the same character, but the authors decided to split them, since the more characters the better and the story would be way too boring (haha) if there were only three characters and a tree/rock. They're super edgy and supposedly funny, when they say something, they get punched by other characters, often by Hime, probably because she desperately wants the viewer to notice her, even though she doesn't really matter and has no role whatsoever. That being said, every comedy/sliceoflife anime has that kind of Mayoi/Sakaki character type - someone who keeps the \"story\" spicy, you know. Sadly for Acchi Kocchi, the author(s) of this piece of... show couldn't think of anything original regarding their stories and personalities, so they ended up being extremely boring and bland, the same way all the other characters did.\\n\r\nEvery episode they do the same stuff over and over again, \"edgy\" jokes from Mayoi/Sakaki rewarded with a punch from Tsumiki/Hime, Io seemingly not being interested in anything at all, since he's too good for everything and everybody and he's oblivious towards Tsumiki's feelings, which puts him in awkward situations, but he doesn't care since he's a badass. At the end of every episode, there's a cute moment between Io and Tsumiki, which is supposed to melt your heart away. \\n\r\nMy brain puked a little bit every once in a while, but in the end I finished it unharmed. Last two episodes I kept my eyes closed and instead of watching that pointless waste of time, I tried to improve my Japanese comprehension. Which didn't really help me, since the characters keep talking about the same stuff over and over again anyway, so there's not enough content for my personal improvement. \\n\\n\r\nI rate 4/10 so people don't get butthurt. The good thing is, that I can't really ever forget the story, since there wasn't any. Feels good.\\n",

            "content": "Acchi Kocchi is about a girl called Tsumiki who's in love with her classmate Io, the anime narrates the stories of her trying to get closer to him.\r\nI consider Acchi Kocchi as the cutest anime I've ever watched. The characters are super adorable and the art style just takes that cuteness to a whole other level. The comedy and the music in it is childish but super good. However, the lack of story progress and character development kind of ruins it for me (As you already know for my previous reviews on this kind of shoujos) but I gotta say I really enjoyed it. Ifyou're into this kind of super moey-romantic slices of life, you're going to LOVE this anime.",

This anime gave me just that! there might not be too much of a plot but everything about this anime made me want to watch more.\r\nThe sound after every part and how they show a little diagram before each scenery was so unique and just made me love it!  \r\nThe art was also really good and different which made the anime all the more fun to watch.\r\nBut the thing iloved the most about acchi kocchi were the amazing character. Tsumiki, a neko like person, is in love with Io, a popular megane character. Their interactions are just so cute! And with those two always comes Sakaki, Mayoi, and Hime. Every single person in their group all has a defined personality and thats one thing i absolutely love!\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment... there wasnt a single episode where i wasnt laughing! the humor is great and even ifs similar throughout every episode, each episode is different in its own way as well. Over all, Acchi Kocchi has officially become one of my favorite animes!",
