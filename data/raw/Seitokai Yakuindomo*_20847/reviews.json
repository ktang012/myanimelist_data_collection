            "content": "Honestly, I love this series. For those of you who watched the first season, although you probably don't need to have in order to enjoy it, theres not much surprise here. All of the returning characters haven't changed much, but that doesn't SYD 2 from being significantly better than the first season. Anyway..\r\nStory: While we still have the average day to day mischief sort of plot, season 2 now adds some fun side stories (like specials within the show) that recur throughout the series. With the introduction of some new characters as well, SYD gets a bit more complex and has a lot more sourcesto draw from for our classic one liners and ecci comedy. Not much plot movement from episode to episode, but then again, there never has been. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the opening theme, it matched the essence of the series completely. The ending totally grew on me as well, and now I can't stop singing either. In terms of music during the episode, it works well to complement the mood and won't overpower the dialogue, but the majority of the focus in SYD are the sound effects, which are perfectly timed. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, this entire series is character driven, and for a very good reason. These characters are outrageous, and hilarious. Incredibly lovable as well. Expect an increase in short Suzu jokes, Hata creepiness, and inappropriate Dejima moments. As I said before, this season introduces a few new characters, such as Tsuda's little sister, her slacker, but incredibly cool best friend Toki, and a rival student council president Uomi who is very similar to Shino-chan. These characters create an incredible dynamic, and Tsuda, our MC, is of course left to deal with them by himself. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I occasionally found myself laughing so hard that it hurt. The episodes are a lot of mini- plots in one, and each is incredibly funny. If you enjoyed the first season, you'll definitely appreciate this second one.  (10/10)",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is an amalgamation of what every young healthy male will dream of if they decide to attend school. After all, it\u2019s where Takatoshi Tsuda goes after eating breakfast every weekday. At school, there\u2019s the student council composed of three female students. Their presence is a like a tranquility to the busy and stressful life of any student seemingly on the outside. Yet behind those doors of the student council room lies a world of diligence, a world of anomaly, a world in which is nothing like you\u2019ll turn back again. It\u2019s where Tsuda makes his memories and a place where unforgettable sins arecommitted by the Powers-To-Be.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this show, you don\u2019t need any knowledge of the previous season or OVAs to comprehend the material. Really, what is there to analyze? It\u2019s a simple premise about a simple guy going to a simple school with intensively complex characters. These characters aren\u2019t your average high school girls. Sure, they have the looks, style, and even authority. However, Seitokai Yukuindomo deconstructs their very being like a cookie cutter with an extravagant taste.\\n\\n\r\nColoring this series as perhaps \u2018unique\u2019 is an overstatement. Despite the characters being almost as if otherworldly when it comes to common sense, the setting still depicts normalcy. What is perhaps unique though is the way this season kicks off with its stellar usage of 3D effects. Supported by an extensive narrative, the sequel establishes itself beyond the norm of a recap. Instead of non-sensational exposition, it seeks to enlighten the audience with its exquisite and clever sequences. We also meet a small yet colorful cast of characters that we are familiar with \u2013 Takatoshi Tsuda, Shino Amakusa, Aria Shichijo, and Suzu Hagimura. Composed of only four members, these characters brings out the brilliance that is of Seitokai Yakuindomo. It doesn\u2019t take an army to present esteem. Rather, it takes guts and our female characters does that on a daily basis with their lecherous thoughts. You would think that girls at their age might be promiscuous but their very thoughts are the essence of this show\u2019s core. Their jokes are usually ephemeral, striking like venom of a snake but becomes so memorable and leaves introspective scars. Perhaps scar is a wrong word to describe these moments but looking back at the episodes, it is memorable in no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show is explicit but not in the ove-rsexualized way fans will think. The innuendos are there along with the gags we should already be familiarized with. It also like to transcend into various themes often relating to life. As human life itself is reproduced sexually, there should be no argument relating to some of its humor in the show. For the student council, they love to learn the thought process relating to sexuality, a centralized phenomenon debated for generations. While the show does have some similarity with the way it emulates it ideas, there\u2019s a large difference with its execution. The series likes to explore concepts relating to school, beyond its norms, and expands more than just academics. Really? Who can focus on books when you have three captivating ladies near you 24/7 anyways. To support this even more so, they are interested in the opposite sex in ways Tsuda can\u2019t even begin to imagine. It\u2019s a dream come true for him although the circumstances itself isn\u2019t one might think.\\n\\n\r\nAt some stages, fans might point out that the show is over-sensationalized with its themes. And this isn\u2019t wrong either. Almost every line in the show deconstructs the normal conversations that you may have with your family or friends. Think of it this way: do you often talk to you friends about how the penis works? Do you often talk to your little brother or sister about reproduction? It\u2019s a point taken granted that the show does over-analyze itself on this subtext. However, it should be important to note that all these are set up as causal jests. None of these should be taken seriously in any way whatsoever. The show itself is labeled as comedy with its humorous and die-hard spoofs. It doesn\u2019t advertise its jokes like on TV but rather as a casual way, as it should be at school. \\n\\n\r\nTo fully appreciate the show doesn\u2019t just take guts. It takes interest and that comes from its characters. The female characters are the dominant factor that stands out in particular Shino. Regardless of her perverted nature, she is famous at school and there\u2019s no doubt about it. We can\u2019t also omit the other two members for their performance. It makes this show\u2019s comedy seem like a paradise because of their presence and lines spoken in each episode. Even supporting characters make their points such as Ranko with her obsessive task of capturing memorable photographs, Mitsuba\u2019s tomboy nature, or even Tsuda\u2019s little sister. Every character is like a puzzle to this product for fans to appreciate. It also occasionally focus on a slightly serious romance nature between characters in particular Tsuda and Shino. Their short yet memorable moments captures innocence in a show clouded by sexual innuendos. Furthermore are the memories that Tsuda make with Suzu in a sibling like manner. But if we look at the bigger picture, Tsuad makes memories with almost everyone. It sets off flags for eager fans of \u2018shipping\u2019 but not in the way of \u201cwho will win the game in the end\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s poked fun with teases. It\u2019s susceptible to actual relationships but often will leap out of with its dialogues. No one will really know who will end up with who in the end. It creates tension and anticipation for what\u2019s to come in the future or if Tsuda will ever get lai-, I mean a girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nAs daring as this series tends to get on various angles, the artwork is more than tolerable for a variety of reasons. Camera angles focuses more on the characters rather than their body parts, well on most parts. From the first episode, there\u2019s a clear proof the series\u2019 improvement in production value. GoHands, a studio known for its variety of works, is the brainchild of these new animation values and presents them in success. Backgrounds are lavishly out there along with the characters. Surprisingly, fan service isn\u2019t also a central way to advertise this season. One might think the girls will be half naked almost every episode but will be pleasantly surprised to realize the opposite. The girls are clothed and shines will brilliance thanks to their characteristics rather than like some barbie doll.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent on most parts as there is a diversity of ways to coordinate itself. Most of it matches its catchy dialogues. Given the nature of the show, there will be moments when fans will wonder themselves \u201cWHAT?\u201d Thanks to its soundtrack, the show will capture this essence of responding. This is accompanied by its dialogues that are all over the place. Some of it will never make sense but that\u2019s what makes this show work like a miracle. The OP and ED song also serves as pivotal proof of its modus operandi. Not that the show even tries but it\u2019s easily noticeable that most of the characters\u2019 voices are consistent that matches their personalities. Perhaps Tsuda stands out the most because he\u2019s the odd one out \u2013 the most normal of the student council, the IT factor.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a treasure that every fan should hunt for. I don\u2019t just mean it as another show to add to your PTW, on-hold, or completed list. No, it\u2019s about appreciation. There are few series that can explicitly bring out a show\u2019s cast characterized by their lustful nature. Usually, you get those beach episode and brain dead protagonists with no personality. They use the typical and cliched \u201cno, it\u2019s what you think!\u201d lines that extorts to the norm. It\u2019s unintelligent and done over and over. What this show will bring out differently is a casual way of experimenting life. Whether you like it or not is up to you but realize this: \\n\\n\r\nThis show is an instrumentality of how comedy series should be done. Seitokai Yakuindomo is a doorknob to absolutely nobody.\\n",

            "content": "The original Seitokai Yakuindomo was (and still is) one of my favourite shows of all time. Which makes the letdown of it's second season that much worse.\r\nThere are other reviews that you can read for a detailed explanation of what's good, what isn't, etc. So I'll boil it down to a few positives and negatives.\r\nPositives:\r\nThe sex jokes that were a staple last season are still as high quality as ever.\r\nThe English teacher (one of my personal favourites) was given much more screentime in this season.\r\nThe Robotics club members were a hilarious addition to the series.\r\nNegatives:\r\nWhile season one was mostly sex jokes, they were interspersed withsome clever non-sexual jokes. This season is 95+% sex jokes, the majority of which are reused to the point of banality.\\n\r\nThe Tsuda & Squid mini-show went from mildly humourous to completely stupid over the course of the season, and ended with an inane and predictable resolution.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWhile still enjoyable, this season remains well in the shadow of it's predecessor. It's still a recommended watch for people who loved the first season, but don't expect the variance and quality you're used to. If you're on the fence about this series after watching a few episodes, don't expect it to get much better.",

            "content": "I completely enjoyed watching Seitokai Yakuindomo. I absolutely had to re-watch it after seeing Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai, a show that I would recommend others to check out if you enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 of Seitokai Yakuindomo.\r\nThe story was pretty good, it's a continuity of the first season obviously. There were a few new characters introduced, new ideas, and most importantly new dirty jokes. Like it's 1st season, Seitokai Yakuindomo* focuses on the student council club and relationships. During the last season towards the last few episodes you could see that Shino, Suzu, Uomi, and Mutsumi were definitelystarted to have more of a personal and closer relationship to Takatoshi. Those feelings, even though they were not acted on too much, really grew a lot deeper in season 2 and I liked that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I disliked about the story in season 2 was that it started to lack creativity, to a certain extent of course. I noticed that lots of the jokes, play on words, etc were being recycled, so after a while I could already tell when a joke was coming and who would be the straight man etc. So the lack of creativity, sort of made it just a little bit unfunny to me. \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many outrageously hilarious moments that were timed perfectly or used during the right moment in season 2. So while it wasn't the best creatively, there were still lots of moments during the show where I had a good laugh or two... maybe three.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was outstanding, and I really feel in love with the settings, for example the city buildings, schools, etc, they were very well animated for a comedy show. I know most comedies, don't really focus much on the artwork that isn't \"important\" or doesn't seem important however just little art details in Seitokai Yakuindomo* made it visually amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I absouletly loved most in Seitokai Yakuindomo is the Voice actors. Most importanly Yoko Hikasa, Sato Satomi, Arai Satomi, Yuu Kobayashi, and Saito Chiwa because they are each my some of my personal favorite Seiyuu's. Something that stood out to me that I found absolutely hilarious was in season one was an episode where Shino hurt herself. There was a homage to K-ON's Mio Akiyama (whom Yoko Hikasa's provided vocals for) in which Shino began acting like Mio when she's scared (crouching down, with tears whining.) \\n\\n\r\nI also liked that Sato Satomi, who voices Ritsu Tainaka in K-ON, did a really great voice impression with her character Aria. I felt that she borrowed the impressions of another seiyuu and her friend Minako Kotobuki who voices Tsumugi Kotobuki in K-ON. Overall Seitokai Yakuindomo* has a really great cast of experienced and well known seiyuu's that works wonders with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the show a 9/10 for being such an outstanding, and most importantly another unique and hilarious daily school life show. There are many shows with this same sort of story and plot however I felt that Seitokai Yakuindomo deserves and has earned the title of the best in overall. I would totally re-watch this again if I had the time.",

            "content": "(This review assumes you have watched season one)\r\nThey say all good things must come to an end, and with the release of this second season it has been proven true once again. While the art and sound remains more or less the same, almost every other aspect seems to have taken a considerably large step down. Perhaps this was the fate of a series focused on sex comedy, but it is no less disappointing.\r\nAlmost every character has degenerated in some way, the most notable of which being Suzu Hagimura. In the first season she's quite the hot-head, and jokes about her size were almost ascommon as the sex jokes. She actually cared about what people thought of her, and was a pretty well defined character known for her brilliance and child-like complexion. In this season, she's a pretty mellow character who doesn't really stand out in any way besides her small size. There aren't very many jokes about her and the ones that do exist are lame, she doesn't really care if you talk about her size but instead she just acts slightly depressed. While in season one she was frequently played out to be a genius, if you had only watched this season you'd think she was just an average girl who is abnormally small; it's as if this season forgot that she is supposed to be a main character. Many (if not most) other characters also degenerated in the transition to season two.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season had a certain class to it and made clever use of the sex jokes. It also wasn't exclusively about sex and it included a healthy mix of normal comedy with the sex comedy to help prevent the dilution of the jokes. It had a rather episodic nature that made it hard to tell it came from a 4-Koma. The characters all felt reasonable and every episode felt complete. You don't see that kind of quality in this season, instead all you see is a bunch of one-liners and perverted girls. There is very little content outside of sex jokes, and the sex jokes are very immature and tasteless compared to the first season. Rather than creating interesting situations like season one did (e.g. the porno mag gift, the trip to Aria's mansion, the suggestion box, the deer feeding, the school competition, plus countless others), this season treats you to a barrage of non-stop one-liners but has nothing else to offer. Indeed, it seems that every character with the exception of Tsuda and Suzu have become three times as perverted to facilitate the endless stream of short, boring, and tasteless jokes. The characters have become little more than puppets and catalysts who's sole purpose is to make more sex jokes.\\n\\n\r\nReally, this feels like a completely different anime when compared to the first season. Admittedly there were a couple of good parts, but all-in-all it lacks the charm that season one has and fails to deliver the same kind of consistent and enjoyable experience it gave you.",

And I have to say this series pretty much granted my wish.\r\nI liked how these girls can say silly jokes almost every minute, and this made me laughed along with some other things (Tsuda's reactions, Tsuda's sister always speaking of her brother in a sexual way...). I also liked the fact that this anime didn't get into the trap of being too ecchi, I think it helped to get more funny situations rather than showing boobs and all every time.\r\nThat's why I rated the first season 7/10. However,the second season is really too similar. It could have been ok, but the fact is the jokes ended up being the same, and so it wasn't as funny as the first one. That's how you realize that an anime can't keep the pace with only these kind of jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSo this season wasn't bad at all, just a little bit too predictable. I would have liked to rate it 6,5 but since it's impossible it'll be a 6.",

Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- what can I say, I like the opening and closing theme, I still like the seiyus who did Shino and Aria's voice overs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3: Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Ok, even if I've marked this sequel as \"Completed\", I've actually focus on episodes 1, 2, 7, 11 and 13, the rest I just skimmed it, since there hasn't been any development at all, frankly I can compared this anime to eating curry where eating it once is good, eating it the 2nd time is a bit ok, but eating on the 3rd time is the part where one would say \"This again!\" Question:  why did I said 'The 3rd\" time? Well, you got the OVA which was shown prior to this sequel as the one to blame for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  Like I've said, there hasn't been any development in this sequel, so blame studio \"GoHands\" for the SNAFU, let's not forget that originally the OVA was suppose to be 1 episode long, so by making the OVA 9 episodes long, they have inadvertently created an unofficial season 2 of the 1st season of this anime, sure the OVA was shown on an irregular basis, but overtime as it accumulate one can watch it as a back season, now combine that with the official season 2 with no development it becomes too boring to watch, in fact it was boring enough for me to give it such score for studio \"GoHand's\" mess. \\n\\n\\n\r\n  Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n",

I think the second season improved on the overall atmosphere and quality of jokes making it a fun show to watch without using your brain.  This show centers around comedy and i think it does a great job at that.  Whenever I watched this show I was grinning ear to ear.  I don't think there is a need to break down the components of this show, because there really isn't a story or character development.  However I will say that the art isdone quite well and I personally liked it.  Also the soundtrack was much more enjoyable to listen to compared to the first seasons intro.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're looking for one of those shows where you can turn off your brain and have a good time this is definitely that show.",

If you're not, I can't help and you should probably decide to stay away from this season now.\r\nI think it's obvious that there is not really a main plot progression here.  By now, I think most of you know that this anime is just a slice of life that has the majority of it's comedy and interactions based around sexual joke/comments.  Honestly, even after watching another season with these dirty jokes, I was still enjoying them just as much as I did duringseason 1 episode 1.  If you enjoyed the plot from the previous installments, you can look forward to experiencing it again.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters stay the same too.  The main difference is that a lot of characters who weren't given all that much screen time previously are given more screen time in this season.   Other than that, it's a matter of either loving or hating characters on a individual basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are great too.  They are still the same style from the previous installments.  Luckily, the art an animation were constant in season 2 since the quality of both aspects seemed to drop during the last 2 episodes of the ovas.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's very fair to say that I enjoyed this anime.  I love Seitokai Yakuindomo.  I s usually don't go through over 30 episodes between 4 days between whatever older anime I may be watching and seasonals.   This anime is just great. It doesn't try to be more than what it is.",

The add of new characters was great and the story keeps with the first season. Both are still one of my favorite to watch from time to time.\r\nThe artwork is very well done not tocartoonish but still made to look like an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know very little Japanese and have to get subtitles but you can still feel the emotions from the VA that were used and I noticed some of the names did some of my favorite characters in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters evolved a little from the first season which just made you love them move.

            "content": "So this is just one of those daily lives of high school students that's just like any other generic, cliche, and typical anime. But the very unique thing about this anime is their puns, PUNS that you all will understands if you're perverted, Puns that will give you an involuntary boner, and PUNS that will make any girl wets just by analyzing them, given the visuals and depiction of an object or gesture made in the anime. \r\nJK\r\nMost of the comedic skit and situation that our MC have to go through involves him being the straight-man of the series. And the funny thing about thisanime is, rather than having our usually horny MC, or perverted MC or male characters making one of the most cringy, creepy, and awkward remarks in relations to sexual implications/jokes. We have females (notice the \"s\"?) doing all of those instead of having a male doing it for them. Which is rare and it's the kind of anime. You could also call this, a sexual trope puns in anime, because it's prolly one of the better comedic series that centralize most of their perverted joke, with a clever and radical way of metaphorically symbolize, or implicating something with our ordinary or plain items or radical contraption. And this is one of the anime where your overall critique shouldn't be centralized on the idea of how slow, or fast the story development, or a character development is. It's a comedy anime nothing else. You should really just evaluate the show entirely based on your overall enjoyment of the series. And obviously you gonna have to be very open minded about what you should be looking forward to the watch the series, and being able to get the clever perverted puns within the show by anticipating, literally, almost everything, that it will turn out to be pretty sexual during, or in the end of the conversation, or arguments. This shit is pretty hilarious for me. And it's prolly better and much less provocative, ecchi like, and conspicuous as shimoneta. This is 100x better than Shimoneta if you're one of those type that likes clever perverted puns/jokes that are more down to earth, universal (when i say universal, i mean having a female character saying, \"fuck, mother fucker\" etc.) , do-able irl with everyday item, less embarassing and shit. But all of this comes down to personal favorite to your very own liking of several genre.",

I rarely stop watching an anime after being nearly at the end, but the second season of Seitokai Yakuindomo is just way too bad.\r\nI enjoyed the 1st season, I really did. Yes, the show's humor was always tasteless, but it used to be witty. Now it's tasteless and plain stupid. Every single episode involves one of these jokes, often repeated more than once (per episode): Suzu's height; mushrooms and other \"keywords\" for male and the equivalents for female genitalia;  wordplay on sex/sexual positions; etc.\r\nAnd every scene has the same scenario - charactersact innocent at first, then comes \"witty\" wordplay (related to sex obviously) and ends with either Tsuda or Suzu being disgusted or confused. That type of jokes can only be funny for so long, after a while it's just cringey and boring. \\n\r\nEither they should've changed the humor after the 1st season, focus more on the story and character relations (strong point in the 1st season) or just make it into a slice of life anime, instead of forcing \"comedy\" so damn hard and needlessly.\\n\r\nIt's just sad when you know what's the joke gonna be about and how stupid it is the moment a new scene begins and the characters start speaking. That should not happen.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, I'm not a fan of preemptive reviewing without finishing the show, but it's not going anywhere. It's stuck at being stupid. One season was more than enough, the content is insufficient to keep going with second - or, god forbid - third season.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boasting a major animation improvement as opposed to its initial release, you may wonder what Seitokai Yakuindomo's second season has in store after a season and an OVA where the floor is sex jokes. Maybe you're expecting character development, or a more plot-driven narrative, or maybe even Suzu getting taller?\r\nMORE SEX JOKES FOR EVERYONE!\r\nI guess it's pretty hard to expect something similar to a story in SYD, as noticing it now, the anime doesn't really diverge that much from the 4-koma. It remains on a standstill while letting days pass with nothing but teases of what could be but doesn't do. While watching halfway throughthe season I gave up on expecting something happening, as I've also read the chapters they were adapting.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does SYD* stand in midst of all the recycled executions for all its innuendoes?\\n\\n\r\nWell, nothing really. Other than being as funny as the OVA, the animation is the only significant change it had. Although I do admit that there were some funny parts that still took me off guard, it stays on the same level as its predecessor as it never tries to leave its shell of lewd.\\n\\n\r\nIt's good that they were being more playful with delivering comedy this time around, but I don't think having CG effects on Suzu's head indicator warrants better animation as a whole. Animation may have gotten better, but that doesn't really apply to a series like SYD. I mean, it's not like 3D sex toys are going to make the punchline any better.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of anime-original content, Studio GoHands may have learned their lesson from the first season, as the segments are more consistent with the theme of the entire show, as nothing feels as dragged out. One of my favorite segments in the series is the \"Squid and Takatoshi\" part, being a sequel to the \"Dried Squid and Takatoshi\" segment from the OVA, being great with its funny cliffhangers and continuation.\\n\\n\r\nI also admire the callbacks to the first season, especially the part when Uomi revisits the school and Shino shows her around. It's fun to see that despite the randomly-placed events in the timeline of the show it has some sort of continuity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are more or less the same, and I still have a firm belief that Uomi steals the spotlight whenever she is there. She is a slightly more unpredictable character than Aria and Shino combined, and her gags are somewhat pulled off better than the rest of the boke group. Hata, as always, remains the most important flag-bearer of the Ousai Academy's comedy, and her snooping tendencies are always enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SYD* has a lot of innovations to its previous installments, it fails at one thing: provide anything new. It is still the same old sequence of exposition-dialogue-punchline with different candy coatings. If you didn't feel satisfied with this season, I won't blame you\u2014heck, I can even make sure that if you haven't enjoyed SYD as much you will absolutely hate this sequel.",

            "content": "Honestly, I love this series. For those of you who watched the first season, although you probably don't need to have in order to enjoy it, theres not much surprise here. All of the returning characters haven't changed much, but that doesn't SYD 2 from being significantly better than the first season. Anyway..\r\nStory: While we still have the average day to day mischief sort of plot, season 2 now adds some fun side stories (like specials within the show) that recur throughout the series. With the introduction of some new characters as well, SYD gets a bit more complex and has a lot more sourcesto draw from for our classic one liners and ecci comedy. Not much plot movement from episode to episode, but then again, there never has been. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Loved the opening theme, it matched the essence of the series completely. The ending totally grew on me as well, and now I can't stop singing either. In terms of music during the episode, it works well to complement the mood and won't overpower the dialogue, but the majority of the focus in SYD are the sound effects, which are perfectly timed. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, this entire series is character driven, and for a very good reason. These characters are outrageous, and hilarious. Incredibly lovable as well. Expect an increase in short Suzu jokes, Hata creepiness, and inappropriate Dejima moments. As I said before, this season introduces a few new characters, such as Tsuda's little sister, her slacker, but incredibly cool best friend Toki, and a rival student council president Uomi who is very similar to Shino-chan. These characters create an incredible dynamic, and Tsuda, our MC, is of course left to deal with them by himself. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I occasionally found myself laughing so hard that it hurt. The episodes are a lot of mini- plots in one, and each is incredibly funny. If you enjoyed the first season, you'll definitely appreciate this second one.  (10/10)",

            "content": "Seitokai Yakuindomo is an amalgamation of what every young healthy male will dream of if they decide to attend school. After all, it\u2019s where Takatoshi Tsuda goes after eating breakfast every weekday. At school, there\u2019s the student council composed of three female students. Their presence is a like a tranquility to the busy and stressful life of any student seemingly on the outside. Yet behind those doors of the student council room lies a world of diligence, a world of anomaly, a world in which is nothing like you\u2019ll turn back again. It\u2019s where Tsuda makes his memories and a place where unforgettable sins arecommitted by the Powers-To-Be.\\n\\n\r\nComing into this show, you don\u2019t need any knowledge of the previous season or OVAs to comprehend the material. Really, what is there to analyze? It\u2019s a simple premise about a simple guy going to a simple school with intensively complex characters. These characters aren\u2019t your average high school girls. Sure, they have the looks, style, and even authority. However, Seitokai Yukuindomo deconstructs their very being like a cookie cutter with an extravagant taste.\\n\\n\r\nColoring this series as perhaps \u2018unique\u2019 is an overstatement. Despite the characters being almost as if otherworldly when it comes to common sense, the setting still depicts normalcy. What is perhaps unique though is the way this season kicks off with its stellar usage of 3D effects. Supported by an extensive narrative, the sequel establishes itself beyond the norm of a recap. Instead of non-sensational exposition, it seeks to enlighten the audience with its exquisite and clever sequences. We also meet a small yet colorful cast of characters that we are familiar with \u2013 Takatoshi Tsuda, Shino Amakusa, Aria Shichijo, and Suzu Hagimura. Composed of only four members, these characters brings out the brilliance that is of Seitokai Yakuindomo. It doesn\u2019t take an army to present esteem. Rather, it takes guts and our female characters does that on a daily basis with their lecherous thoughts. You would think that girls at their age might be promiscuous but their very thoughts are the essence of this show\u2019s core. Their jokes are usually ephemeral, striking like venom of a snake but becomes so memorable and leaves introspective scars. Perhaps scar is a wrong word to describe these moments but looking back at the episodes, it is memorable in no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the show is explicit but not in the ove-rsexualized way fans will think. The innuendos are there along with the gags we should already be familiarized with. It also like to transcend into various themes often relating to life. As human life itself is reproduced sexually, there should be no argument relating to some of its humor in the show. For the student council, they love to learn the thought process relating to sexuality, a centralized phenomenon debated for generations. While the show does have some similarity with the way it emulates it ideas, there\u2019s a large difference with its execution. The series likes to explore concepts relating to school, beyond its norms, and expands more than just academics. Really? Who can focus on books when you have three captivating ladies near you 24/7 anyways. To support this even more so, they are interested in the opposite sex in ways Tsuda can\u2019t even begin to imagine. It\u2019s a dream come true for him although the circumstances itself isn\u2019t one might think.\\n\\n\r\nAt some stages, fans might point out that the show is over-sensationalized with its themes. And this isn\u2019t wrong either. Almost every line in the show deconstructs the normal conversations that you may have with your family or friends. Think of it this way: do you often talk to you friends about how the penis works? Do you often talk to your little brother or sister about reproduction? It\u2019s a point taken granted that the show does over-analyze itself on this subtext. However, it should be important to note that all these are set up as causal jests. None of these should be taken seriously in any way whatsoever. The show itself is labeled as comedy with its humorous and die-hard spoofs. It doesn\u2019t advertise its jokes like on TV but rather as a casual way, as it should be at school. \\n\\n\r\nTo fully appreciate the show doesn\u2019t just take guts. It takes interest and that comes from its characters. The female characters are the dominant factor that stands out in particular Shino. Regardless of her perverted nature, she is famous at school and there\u2019s no doubt about it. We can\u2019t also omit the other two members for their performance. It makes this show\u2019s comedy seem like a paradise because of their presence and lines spoken in each episode. Even supporting characters make their points such as Ranko with her obsessive task of capturing memorable photographs, Mitsuba\u2019s tomboy nature, or even Tsuda\u2019s little sister. Every character is like a puzzle to this product for fans to appreciate. It also occasionally focus on a slightly serious romance nature between characters in particular Tsuda and Shino. Their short yet memorable moments captures innocence in a show clouded by sexual innuendos. Furthermore are the memories that Tsuda make with Suzu in a sibling like manner. But if we look at the bigger picture, Tsuad makes memories with almost everyone. It sets off flags for eager fans of \u2018shipping\u2019 but not in the way of \u201cwho will win the game in the end\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s poked fun with teases. It\u2019s susceptible to actual relationships but often will leap out of with its dialogues. No one will really know who will end up with who in the end. It creates tension and anticipation for what\u2019s to come in the future or if Tsuda will ever get lai-, I mean a girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nAs daring as this series tends to get on various angles, the artwork is more than tolerable for a variety of reasons. Camera angles focuses more on the characters rather than their body parts, well on most parts. From the first episode, there\u2019s a clear proof the series\u2019 improvement in production value. GoHands, a studio known for its variety of works, is the brainchild of these new animation values and presents them in success. Backgrounds are lavishly out there along with the characters. Surprisingly, fan service isn\u2019t also a central way to advertise this season. One might think the girls will be half naked almost every episode but will be pleasantly surprised to realize the opposite. The girls are clothed and shines will brilliance thanks to their characteristics rather than like some barbie doll.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent on most parts as there is a diversity of ways to coordinate itself. Most of it matches its catchy dialogues. Given the nature of the show, there will be moments when fans will wonder themselves \u201cWHAT?\u201d Thanks to its soundtrack, the show will capture this essence of responding. This is accompanied by its dialogues that are all over the place. Some of it will never make sense but that\u2019s what makes this show work like a miracle. The OP and ED song also serves as pivotal proof of its modus operandi. Not that the show even tries but it\u2019s easily noticeable that most of the characters\u2019 voices are consistent that matches their personalities. Perhaps Tsuda stands out the most because he\u2019s the odd one out \u2013 the most normal of the student council, the IT factor.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a treasure that every fan should hunt for. I don\u2019t just mean it as another show to add to your PTW, on-hold, or completed list. No, it\u2019s about appreciation. There are few series that can explicitly bring out a show\u2019s cast characterized by their lustful nature. Usually, you get those beach episode and brain dead protagonists with no personality. They use the typical and cliched \u201cno, it\u2019s what you think!\u201d lines that extorts to the norm. It\u2019s unintelligent and done over and over. What this show will bring out differently is a casual way of experimenting life. Whether you like it or not is up to you but realize this: \\n\\n\r\nThis show is an instrumentality of how comedy series should be done. Seitokai Yakuindomo is a doorknob to absolutely nobody.\\n",

            "content": "The original Seitokai Yakuindomo was (and still is) one of my favourite shows of all time. Which makes the letdown of it's second season that much worse.\r\nThere are other reviews that you can read for a detailed explanation of what's good, what isn't, etc. So I'll boil it down to a few positives and negatives.\r\nPositives:\r\nThe sex jokes that were a staple last season are still as high quality as ever.\r\nThe English teacher (one of my personal favourites) was given much more screentime in this season.\r\nThe Robotics club members were a hilarious addition to the series.\r\nNegatives:\r\nWhile season one was mostly sex jokes, they were interspersed withsome clever non-sexual jokes. This season is 95+% sex jokes, the majority of which are reused to the point of banality.\\n\r\nThe Tsuda & Squid mini-show went from mildly humourous to completely stupid over the course of the season, and ended with an inane and predictable resolution.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nWhile still enjoyable, this season remains well in the shadow of it's predecessor. It's still a recommended watch for people who loved the first season, but don't expect the variance and quality you're used to. If you're on the fence about this series after watching a few episodes, don't expect it to get much better.",

            "content": "I completely enjoyed watching Seitokai Yakuindomo. I absolutely had to re-watch it after seeing Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai, a show that I would recommend others to check out if you enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 of Seitokai Yakuindomo.\r\nThe story was pretty good, it's a continuity of the first season obviously. There were a few new characters introduced, new ideas, and most importantly new dirty jokes. Like it's 1st season, Seitokai Yakuindomo* focuses on the student council club and relationships. During the last season towards the last few episodes you could see that Shino, Suzu, Uomi, and Mutsumi were definitelystarted to have more of a personal and closer relationship to Takatoshi. Those feelings, even though they were not acted on too much, really grew a lot deeper in season 2 and I liked that.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I disliked about the story in season 2 was that it started to lack creativity, to a certain extent of course. I noticed that lots of the jokes, play on words, etc were being recycled, so after a while I could already tell when a joke was coming and who would be the straight man etc. So the lack of creativity, sort of made it just a little bit unfunny to me. \\n\\n\r\nThere were so many outrageously hilarious moments that were timed perfectly or used during the right moment in season 2. So while it wasn't the best creatively, there were still lots of moments during the show where I had a good laugh or two... maybe three.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was outstanding, and I really feel in love with the settings, for example the city buildings, schools, etc, they were very well animated for a comedy show. I know most comedies, don't really focus much on the artwork that isn't \"important\" or doesn't seem important however just little art details in Seitokai Yakuindomo* made it visually amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I absouletly loved most in Seitokai Yakuindomo is the Voice actors. Most importanly Yoko Hikasa, Sato Satomi, Arai Satomi, Yuu Kobayashi, and Saito Chiwa because they are each my some of my personal favorite Seiyuu's. Something that stood out to me that I found absolutely hilarious was in season one was an episode where Shino hurt herself. There was a homage to K-ON's Mio Akiyama (whom Yoko Hikasa's provided vocals for) in which Shino began acting like Mio when she's scared (crouching down, with tears whining.) \\n\\n\r\nI also liked that Sato Satomi, who voices Ritsu Tainaka in K-ON, did a really great voice impression with her character Aria. I felt that she borrowed the impressions of another seiyuu and her friend Minako Kotobuki who voices Tsumugi Kotobuki in K-ON. Overall Seitokai Yakuindomo* has a really great cast of experienced and well known seiyuu's that works wonders with the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the show a 9/10 for being such an outstanding, and most importantly another unique and hilarious daily school life show. There are many shows with this same sort of story and plot however I felt that Seitokai Yakuindomo deserves and has earned the title of the best in overall. I would totally re-watch this again if I had the time.",

            "content": "(This review assumes you have watched season one)\r\nThey say all good things must come to an end, and with the release of this second season it has been proven true once again. While the art and sound remains more or less the same, almost every other aspect seems to have taken a considerably large step down. Perhaps this was the fate of a series focused on sex comedy, but it is no less disappointing.\r\nAlmost every character has degenerated in some way, the most notable of which being Suzu Hagimura. In the first season she's quite the hot-head, and jokes about her size were almost ascommon as the sex jokes. She actually cared about what people thought of her, and was a pretty well defined character known for her brilliance and child-like complexion. In this season, she's a pretty mellow character who doesn't really stand out in any way besides her small size. There aren't very many jokes about her and the ones that do exist are lame, she doesn't really care if you talk about her size but instead she just acts slightly depressed. While in season one she was frequently played out to be a genius, if you had only watched this season you'd think she was just an average girl who is abnormally small; it's as if this season forgot that she is supposed to be a main character. Many (if not most) other characters also degenerated in the transition to season two.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season had a certain class to it and made clever use of the sex jokes. It also wasn't exclusively about sex and it included a healthy mix of normal comedy with the sex comedy to help prevent the dilution of the jokes. It had a rather episodic nature that made it hard to tell it came from a 4-Koma. The characters all felt reasonable and every episode felt complete. You don't see that kind of quality in this season, instead all you see is a bunch of one-liners and perverted girls. There is very little content outside of sex jokes, and the sex jokes are very immature and tasteless compared to the first season. Rather than creating interesting situations like season one did (e.g. the porno mag gift, the trip to Aria's mansion, the suggestion box, the deer feeding, the school competition, plus countless others), this season treats you to a barrage of non-stop one-liners but has nothing else to offer. Indeed, it seems that every character with the exception of Tsuda and Suzu have become three times as perverted to facilitate the endless stream of short, boring, and tasteless jokes. The characters have become little more than puppets and catalysts who's sole purpose is to make more sex jokes.\\n\\n\r\nReally, this feels like a completely different anime when compared to the first season. Admittedly there were a couple of good parts, but all-in-all it lacks the charm that season one has and fails to deliver the same kind of consistent and enjoyable experience it gave you.",

And I have to say this series pretty much granted my wish.\r\nI liked how these girls can say silly jokes almost every minute, and this made me laughed along with some other things (Tsuda's reactions, Tsuda's sister always speaking of her brother in a sexual way...). I also liked the fact that this anime didn't get into the trap of being too ecchi, I think it helped to get more funny situations rather than showing boobs and all every time.\r\nThat's why I rated the first season 7/10. However,the second season is really too similar. It could have been ok, but the fact is the jokes ended up being the same, and so it wasn't as funny as the first one. That's how you realize that an anime can't keep the pace with only these kind of jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSo this season wasn't bad at all, just a little bit too predictable. I would have liked to rate it 6,5 but since it's impossible it'll be a 6.",

Article 00 Section 00, Never make a season 3  using the same stuff used from the previous season.\r\nI know, I know, this anime is a season 2 and not a season 3, so l'll explain later at the Overall category of this sequel as I get down to business and present each of my ratings for this sequel's category:\r\nMediocre 5: Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\r\nStory, Art and Character- as usual, there hasn't been any changers as to the plot because there isn't any, no changes onthe jokes and gags, no changes on the character's behavior even with the introduction of Uomi, no changes on the school's uniform and most of all no relationship development that has occurred...except of course the last episode where the 2 senior girls have graduated and even so it has little to do with anything, then again it nice that the sequel has given this anime a close ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGood 7: Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- what can I say, I like the opening and closing theme, I still like the seiyus who did Shino and Aria's voice overs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3: Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-  Ok, even if I've marked this sequel as \"Completed\", I've actually focus on episodes 1, 2, 7, 11 and 13, the rest I just skimmed it, since there hasn't been any development at all, frankly I can compared this anime to eating curry where eating it once is good, eating it the 2nd time is a bit ok, but eating on the 3rd time is the part where one would say \"This again!\" Question:  why did I said 'The 3rd\" time? Well, you got the OVA which was shown prior to this sequel as the one to blame for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-  Like I've said, there hasn't been any development in this sequel, so blame studio \"GoHands\" for the SNAFU, let's not forget that originally the OVA was suppose to be 1 episode long, so by making the OVA 9 episodes long, they have inadvertently created an unofficial season 2 of the 1st season of this anime, sure the OVA was shown on an irregular basis, but overtime as it accumulate one can watch it as a back season, now combine that with the official season 2 with no development it becomes too boring to watch, in fact it was boring enough for me to give it such score for studio \"GoHand's\" mess. \\n\\n\\n\r\n  Tong! Tong! Tong! Prrrt! Prrrt! Prrrt!\\n",

I think the second season improved on the overall atmosphere and quality of jokes making it a fun show to watch without using your brain.  This show centers around comedy and i think it does a great job at that.  Whenever I watched this show I was grinning ear to ear.  I don't think there is a need to break down the components of this show, because there really isn't a story or character development.  However I will say that the art isdone quite well and I personally liked it.  Also the soundtrack was much more enjoyable to listen to compared to the first seasons intro.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you're looking for one of those shows where you can turn off your brain and have a good time this is definitely that show.",

If you're not, I can't help and you should probably decide to stay away from this season now.\r\nI think it's obvious that there is not really a main plot progression here.  By now, I think most of you know that this anime is just a slice of life that has the majority of it's comedy and interactions based around sexual joke/comments.  Honestly, even after watching another season with these dirty jokes, I was still enjoying them just as much as I did duringseason 1 episode 1.  If you enjoyed the plot from the previous installments, you can look forward to experiencing it again.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters stay the same too.  The main difference is that a lot of characters who weren't given all that much screen time previously are given more screen time in this season.   Other than that, it's a matter of either loving or hating characters on a individual basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are great too.  They are still the same style from the previous installments.  Luckily, the art an animation were constant in season 2 since the quality of both aspects seemed to drop during the last 2 episodes of the ovas.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's very fair to say that I enjoyed this anime.  I love Seitokai Yakuindomo.  I s usually don't go through over 30 episodes between 4 days between whatever older anime I may be watching and seasonals.   This anime is just great. It doesn't try to be more than what it is.",

This year his little sister started as a first year (just as perverted as the president and treasurer) and makes a new friend. The add of new characters was great and the story keeps with the first season. Both are still one of my favorite to watch from time to time.\r\nThe artwork is very well done not tocartoonish but still made to look like an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know very little Japanese and have to get subtitles but you can still feel the emotions from the VA that were used and I noticed some of the names did some of my favorite characters in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters evolved a little from the first season which just made you love them move.

            "content": "So this is just one of those daily lives of high school students that's just like any other generic, cliche, and typical anime. But the very unique thing about this anime is their puns, PUNS that you all will understands if you're perverted, Puns that will give you an involuntary boner, and PUNS that will make any girl wets just by analyzing them, given the visuals and depiction of an object or gesture made in the anime. \r\nJK\r\nMost of the comedic skit and situation that our MC have to go through involves him being the straight-man of the series. And the funny thing about thisanime is, rather than having our usually horny MC, or perverted MC or male characters making one of the most cringy, creepy, and awkward remarks in relations to sexual implications/jokes. We have females (notice the \"s\"?) doing all of those instead of having a male doing it for them. Which is rare and it's the kind of anime. You could also call this, a sexual trope puns in anime, because it's prolly one of the better comedic series that centralize most of their perverted joke, with a clever and radical way of metaphorically symbolize, or implicating something with our ordinary or plain items or radical contraption. And this is one of the anime where your overall critique shouldn't be centralized on the idea of how slow, or fast the story development, or a character development is. It's a comedy anime nothing else. You should really just evaluate the show entirely based on your overall enjoyment of the series. And obviously you gonna have to be very open minded about what you should be looking forward to the watch the series, and being able to get the clever perverted puns within the show by anticipating, literally, almost everything, that it will turn out to be pretty sexual during, or in the end of the conversation, or arguments. This shit is pretty hilarious for me. And it's prolly better and much less provocative, ecchi like, and conspicuous as shimoneta. This is 100x better than Shimoneta if you're one of those type that likes clever perverted puns/jokes that are more down to earth, universal (when i say universal, i mean having a female character saying, \"fuck, mother fucker\" etc.) , do-able irl with everyday item, less embarassing and shit. But all of this comes down to personal favorite to your very own liking of several genre.",

I rarely stop watching an anime after being nearly at the end, but the second season of Seitokai Yakuindomo is just way too bad.\r\nI enjoyed the 1st season, I really did. Yes, the show's humor was always tasteless, but it used to be witty. Now it's tasteless and plain stupid. Every single episode involves one of these jokes, often repeated more than once (per episode): Suzu's height; mushrooms and other \"keywords\" for male and the equivalents for female genitalia;  wordplay on sex/sexual positions; etc.\r\nAnd every scene has the same scenario - charactersact innocent at first, then comes \"witty\" wordplay (related to sex obviously) and ends with either Tsuda or Suzu being disgusted or confused. That type of jokes can only be funny for so long, after a while it's just cringey and boring. \\n\r\nEither they should've changed the humor after the 1st season, focus more on the story and character relations (strong point in the 1st season) or just make it into a slice of life anime, instead of forcing \"comedy\" so damn hard and needlessly.\\n\r\nIt's just sad when you know what's the joke gonna be about and how stupid it is the moment a new scene begins and the characters start speaking. That should not happen.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, I'm not a fan of preemptive reviewing without finishing the show, but it's not going anywhere. It's stuck at being stupid.

            "content": "Boasting a major animation improvement as opposed to its initial release, you may wonder what Seitokai Yakuindomo's second season has in store after a season and an OVA where the floor is sex jokes. Maybe you're expecting character development, or a more plot-driven narrative, or maybe even Suzu getting taller?\r\nMORE SEX JOKES FOR EVERYONE!\r\nI guess it's pretty hard to expect something similar to a story in SYD, as noticing it now, the anime doesn't really diverge that much from the 4-koma. It remains on a standstill while letting days pass with nothing but teases of what could be but doesn't do. While watching halfway throughthe season I gave up on expecting something happening, as I've also read the chapters they were adapting.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does SYD* stand in midst of all the recycled executions for all its innuendoes?\\n\\n\r\nWell, nothing really. Other than being as funny as the OVA, the animation is the only significant change it had. Although I do admit that there were some funny parts that still took me off guard, it stays on the same level as its predecessor as it never tries to leave its shell of lewd.\\n\\n\r\nIt's good that they were being more playful with delivering comedy this time around, but I don't think having CG effects on Suzu's head indicator warrants better animation as a whole. Animation may have gotten better, but that doesn't really apply to a series like SYD. I mean, it's not like 3D sex toys are going to make the punchline any better.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of anime-original content, Studio GoHands may have learned their lesson from the first season, as the segments are more consistent with the theme of the entire show, as nothing feels as dragged out. One of my favorite segments in the series is the \"Squid and Takatoshi\" part, being a sequel to the \"Dried Squid and Takatoshi\" segment from the OVA, being great with its funny cliffhangers and continuation.\\n\\n\r\nI also admire the callbacks to the first season, especially the part when Uomi revisits the school and Shino shows her around. It's fun to see that despite the randomly-placed events in the timeline of the show it has some sort of continuity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are more or less the same, and I still have a firm belief that Uomi steals the spotlight whenever she is there. She is a slightly more unpredictable character than Aria and Shino combined, and her gags are somewhat pulled off better than the rest of the boke group. Hata, as always, remains the most important flag-bearer of the Ousai Academy's comedy, and her snooping tendencies are always enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SYD* has a lot of innovations to its previous installments, it fails at one thing: provide anything new. It is still the same old sequence of exposition-dialogue-punchline with different candy coatings. If you didn't feel satisfied with this season, I won't blame you\u2014heck, I can even make sure that if you haven't enjoyed SYD as much you will absolutely hate this sequel.",
