            "content": "This anime is a panacea of the heart and mind.\r\nLife too stressful? Worried or anxious about something? Just sit down in front of the screen and put this anime on, and all your concerns will dissolve away - probably within seconds. Everything - setting, plot, sound, music, art, humour - all of it is perfectly crafted at maximising this effect. And what an effect it is.\r\nThe story itself is a simple one. It follows the daily lives of four girls of various ages who all live in the same rural village and are in the same class at school. Almost everything that happens is followingtheir daily lives, with events that are both realistic and completely believable. As far as overarching story goes, that's about it - this isn't an anime you should be watching if you only care for a tense plot full of twists and turns. It is predominantly episodic in nature, although characters and settings are gradually built up over time so there's no lack of progress. Each episode contains one or two stories, every single one of which is a joy to watch and will melt your heart. The humour is lighthearted in tone, and is aimed at adding to this heart-melting effect, rather than at making you laugh out loud, although there are a few moments that could do this as well. There are also a few moments that will invoke other emotions, all very effectively and very naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is focused mainly on the four girls. Komari is the eldest of the four, although you wouldn't know it by looking. She is very self conscious of the fact that she is unusually small for her age and tries to make up for this by attempting (and largely failing) to act grown up. Hotaru, on the other hand, is unusually mature, at least on a physical level, for a fifth grader. She also quickly develops a crush on her cute chibi senpai, although none of the others ever seem to realise it. Natsumi is Komari's younger sister, and is a bit of a layabout. She's too lazy to work hard at anything and is always getting in trouble for one thing or another. And then there's Renge, called \"Ren-chon\" by Natsumi. I could honestly wax lyrical about Ren-chon all day, but I don't want to bore you any more than I already am, so I'll just say that she's the youngest of the cast, who knows a lot about things that you wouldn't expect a first grade student to know, but otherwise acts fairly normally for her age. Oh, she also has some brilliant facial expressions, and Koiwai Kotori's voice acting of her character is a definite candidate for being the best I've ever come across.\\n\r\nEvery member of the supporting cast, just like the main characters, each have their own distinctive but realistic and believable personalities, and are every bit as likeable as the central four cast members.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour and characters may be brilliant, but what makes this series really stand out is the music and images. As someone who tends to focus very heavily on the characters of a series, I don't usually care much for these things - as long as they add to the immersement, enjoyment and feel of a series, just about anything's fine by me. But here even I can't help but be overwhelmed. The series starts with nothing but pictures, sound effects and music building up the scene and setting with pure imagery. It's almost 2.5 minutes before anything is actually said, yet by that time you will likely have already entered into a state of total bliss from the gorgeous artwork, more reminiscent of a high budget film or even something you might see in an art gallery than a TV series, and soothing background music and sound effects of what is being shown. And, while the effect may not be as intense in later scenes, the quality does not drop. Just about every background in this entire series is a work of art both literally and figuratively.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the first episode over and over again and every time the effect is the same. The entire anime is thoroughly rewatchable, and every episode provides the perfect relaxation whether on your first watch or your tenth. Even brilliantly written series that depend on plot twists and reveals often grow dull when watching through for the third time, but that is of no concern for an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of slower paced anime, however, require you to be in the right mood before watching them, but again that is of no concern here, as Non Non Biyori will put you in that right mood, no matter what your previous state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a series to be watched, loved and enjoyed over and over again. Everything is perfectly toned to add to this viewing pleasure as much as possible, and it is indeed a pure pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know what nirvana feels like, watch this anime.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I'll try my best to follow the guidelines.\r\nAh. Non Non Biyori.\r\nTo be honest, when I first saw the concept art and previews, I was not impressed. Frankly, I dismissed it as yet another slice of life show, a genre so regularly plagiarized that one can't help but wonder if the anime studios are running out of ideas, as each subsequent series seems to be a cut and paste of an earlier show. It was only with great encouragement from Youtube pianist Tehishter that I began watching the show with the lowest of expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at howwrong I was.\\n\\n\r\n=Story 8/10=\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. Hotarun, a Tokyo-bred city girl, finds herself moving out of the hustle and bustle of a metropolitan life and into the middle of the countryside thanks to her father's job transfer. There, she enrolls into a school that has only 1 teacher and 5 students of varying grades. Gradually, she grows accustomed to the joys of friendship and a peaceful lifestyle. That is pretty much it, story wise. Arguably, that is all it needs to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this might not sound like much, the writers did a fantastic job of painting a picturesque scene, albeit rather romanticized, of the differences between living in the countryside and living in the city. To roughly quote Ren-chon, \"Don't you own a mountain in the city, Hotarun?\". There is an interesting element of comedic relief to the show as well, which does a good job of creating a light hearted and heart-warming experience altogether. It is exactly because of the lack of intricacies and complications that make this anime such a joy to watch. :)\\n\\n\r\n=Art 9/10=\\n\r\nBeing a show that revolves around country lifestyle, the show does a superb job of vividly painting the landscapes and creating a nice environment that truly sucks the viewer in. I was rather absorbed into the many beautifully done landscapes and views. The show, indeed, was full of screenshot worthy moments. The characters are nicely done as well. I for one, was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fan-service and the way the creators managed to maintain a very innocent image of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n=Sound 9/10= \\n\r\nAh. The soundtrack. I often see reviewers claim that a soundtrack is plain, boring or not memorable. I would argue otherwise. The sole purpose of a soundtrack is to immerse the viewer into the atmosphere of the show, to deliberate the mood and 'flow' of the show. In this regard, the Non Non Biyori soundtrack does its job wonderfully. The subtle hints and ambient sounds that are played fit very well into the show. It suits the laidback and heartwarming theme of the show very well. As for the OP, it introduces the playful and childish mood of the overall show, which nano.ripe performs superbly. The ED is just adorable.\\n\\n\r\n=Character 7/10=\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are decent. I liked that the show did not introduce any stereotypes or overdo any of the characters. There's Hotaru, the classy but sweet city girl, the sisters Komari and Natsumi, and Renge, who make up the main cast of the show. They each have their varying quirks and personalities, all of which are interesting in their own ways. There is, surprisingly enough, some decent and well thought out character development, in particular, the relationship between 'sweet shop lady' and Renge. I have personally lost count at how many times I've let out an audible aww throughout this series. \\n\\n\r\n=Enjoyment 10/10=\\n\r\nI love this show. No words can convey how I feel about this show, to be honest, but I'll try. Every week for the past 7 weeks, I looked forward to the airing of Non Non Biyori. Although I only got into the show halfway through the season, I was instantly hooked. I really enjoyed the laidback and calming experience that is Non Non Biyori. No matter how crappy or pissed off I felt at the time, I couldn't help but smile like an idiot after the show. Unlike other slice of life animes, Non Non Biyori is different in the sense that one truly feels at peace while watching the show. There is no drama or climax, no ante or distress. Watching the show was for me, pure bliss. 23 minutes of smiling like an idiot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime does what it set out to do perfectly. Granted, some might not enjoy the lack of action or fan service, but let me say this. Give the show a try. If you've had a crappy day at school, a disastrous meeting at work or if you just wanted to relax for a bit, watch this show. It's not the best show of the year, or even of the season, but it is special in its own right. \\n\\n\r\n9/10. \\n",

            "content": "Yes, I have a sweet spot for slice of life anime. I genuinely enjoyed the laid-back shows such as GJ-bu, Tamayura, Yuyushiki etcetera this year, but that doesn't stop me from saying that Non Non Biyori was one of the most conformist and loveliest experiences in the past few months. It's definitely great-tier in the slice of life section. \r\nThe simplistic story takes place in a rural area of the countryside. Eleven year old Hotaru Ichijou moves into the town from Tokyo with her parents, and transfers into a school consisting of only four more students; Renge, Natsumi and Komari (yes, it's a rather smallschool). It shows the ordinary lives of these children, as well as other residents in the town throughout the seasons of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThat is quite literally it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hence is one reason why I love this show dearly. The story knows exactly what its purpose is; relaxation and healing. The execution of the countryside is depicted very well: The writing isn't complicated in the least, rather very simplistic, but the pacing and direction takes a gentle slow approach, and especially a faithful one to its original setting (it's based on a real place after all). Everything content wise is pretty much laid back, whether it's the lack of vehicles to rivers streaming, or doors without locks to shops without its shopkeeper (you pay in the money box!). The nature environment and gentle flow keeps this show consistently soothing, and each episode has the magic to ease you from anxiety or worries.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all slice of life though, as its comedic factor takes a big role too. In its environment, it's very light-hearted comedy, carried by its characters heavily, but largely comedy based nevertheless. I'd say it's a mix between Aria's slice of life aspect and Nichijou or Azumanga's comedic aspect, although more plausible than random. But the amount of laughing fit moments are high in its otherwise slow stretched content.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori doesn't illustrate any life messages at the end of every episode, unlike Aria or Tamayura, and its story doesn't particularly end on a high note either (which is good though because second season is possible). However, a few episodes can cause need of replacement for heartstrings, as the dedicated episodes can really warm and break the heart if you're not careful (which can consist of moments we can relate to too). But generally, the story presents the interactions and lives of our cast, and to lay back, eat ice cream and relax in ease is the best way to approach a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nIn our cast we have the little grade 1, Renge, the two sisters Komari and Natsumi (grade 8 and 7) and Hotaru, grade 5. They all have pretty distinct personalities, although can be considered realistic. What makes watching them more interesting though is that they're all different ages and have different mindsets, so the interactions and chemistry between each of them together are often entertaining. Especially with Renge, because we're able to see a point of view of a child, not often expressed in anime, in which her childish mindset and logic can be quite ironic yet sweet. The characters pretty much drive the comedy factors forward, and you grow to care for them as the series gradually continues.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the lack of pandering and 'sexual' fanservice is a strong trait of this show as well. The anime makes hardly any attempt to sexualize the characters (except the beach episode (which wasn't actually typical either (yes there's a beach in the countryside, deal with it))). The prohibition of panty and focus-on-body-parts shots makes them non-existent, and helps the faithfulness of this show to keep its soothing story from being ruined. It also ranges a better audience to non-anime fans (as the Japanese countryside people apparently like this show a lot!).\\n\\n\r\nI adore the animation in this show a lot. A lot of long pauses in this show makes up various, delicious wallpapers to use; it's like an impressive painting exhibition at times, with distinct, bright colours of nature in land and sky. Rivers sometimes flow, looking beautiful with reflections and sparkles. It just seems so fun to draw and paint some spectacular scenery, and such exhibitions are a complete plus in these kinds of shows. The shadings and lightning are handled very carefully too, and are the notable strengths in the art department. And of course, the budget is pretty high but that's to be expected with a slice of life shows as they usually are (there's lots of money to spend with not many scenes).\\n\\n\r\nSound direction is done craftily great too. The soundtrack portrays a lazy yet calming mood for the show, sometimes being the center of the scene for a few times. The careful use of silence and sound effects suits the environment of the countryside, in which helps essence the lovely atmosphere this show has to offer at front. The voice actors deliver their lines well, whether it's a punchline or not. You'd probably recognize Joshiraku's Marii in this, and Renge's VA coins the child character with ace. The OP and ED are generally enjoyable to listen to as well, and not once I skipped it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Non Non Biyori is definitely one of the better shows in its respective genre. It may look appealing to moe-inducers, but its environment and atmosphere is what sets itself apart from the typical slice of life anime with girls doing nothing. Its fun characters, lack of fanservice and soothing lazy pace helps the show in becoming a decent healing anime. And girls doing nothing it is, but as long as you have the right mindset and approach towards this show then it's highly enjoyable and comforting, especially when you're feeling down the dumps or blues. It's an anime that makes you smile; one that eases your tensity.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I love the slice of life healing genre.",

            "content": "The slice of life genre was a captivating one. Having the ability to soothe the viewer. To give them that warm feeling inside. It was beautiful. But now slice of life is filled with big eyed, blob faced, cute girls. In other words, moe. If you don't know what moe is to put it simply its cute girls who do cute things. Although cute girls doing cute things isn't necessarily bad. Most lack a good story, meaningful characters,or both. In other words anime studios are focusing too much on making the show cute rather than focusing on the quality ofthe show itself.Sadly, these kinds of anime have slowly been increasing with each coming year. But among this moe epidemic. There are a few animes that rise above this trend and become a glint of hope for this dying genre.\\n\\n\r\n    Non Non Biyori is one of these animes.\\n\\n\r\n   The story is about a school in the countryside with only four students. All from different grades ranging from first to ninth. One day a transfer student called Hotaru Ichijou from Tokyo transfers to this school because of his father's job. The anime revolves around these girls and their life in the countryside.\\n\\n\r\n    The story runs out like other schoolgirl animes. It's episodic. But what makes this anime special is that every episode is skillfully crafted with great care to soothe the viewer and give the viewer a happy grin every episode. Almost every episode is realistic so there are many episodes where the viewer can relate to the show. Ever tried to hide a bad test score from your mom? or run away from your mom only to come back later? If you have then you will feel right at home with Non Non Biyori. Every episode is a beautiful adventure in itself. From playing ball on recess to making a cultural festival for less than five people. Every episode is fun, soothing, and a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\n    One look at Non Non Biyori and you know that silver link has put a lot of money into this anime. Movements are fluid. Designs are great, but what makes the art truly stand out is the background. The countryside is animated beautifully. The backgrounds feel alive. Everything from the trees to leaves falling. Even a river flowing is made with such detail. It's like the cross between art and realism. It's absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\n   The sound is (for a lack of a better term.) Just beautiful. Nano.Ripe brings us \"A rainbow colored day\". A great opening that fits this anime perfectly. The soundtrack is also something to listen to. Every track fits every scene accurately. The piano tracks are truly something captivating, and certain instruments like the harmonica are used to give the viewer that countryside feel. The ending song doesn't have the same quality as the opening and the soundtrack but I warmed up to it after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n   The story, animation, and the sound in Non Non Biyori are all beautiful, but what propels Non Non Biyori to be truly special is the characters. The main cast of Non Non Biyori consists of 4 characters. Komari Koshigaya, Natsume Koshigaya, Hotaru Ichijou and Renge Miyauchi. Komari is an eighth grader who is very self conscious about her small and short body. Because fo this she tries to act grown up, usually without success. Then you have Komari's younger sister Natsume Koshigaya. A seventh grader who hates studying and likes to play. She's untidy, lazy, and her grades are terrible. She usually sees Komari as a younger sister than an older one because of her small body. Then you have Renge Chan. A talented and eccentric first grader. Although she usually acts like a typicall first grader. Ther are some parts that show off her talents and her eccentric parts. Words really can't describe her accurately. You just have to watch the anime for yourself. And last but not least you have Hotaru Ichijou. A fifth grade transfer student from Tokyo who is physically mature for her age.( Guys, you know what I mean.) She is polite and overal a nice person. But the twist is that she has a crush on Komari. Which is a basis for some of the comedy in Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\n   One very interesting thing about Non Non Biyori is how it develops its characters. Now at face value these characters may seem somewhat stereotypical. But one thing that I really have to give Non Non Biyori credit for is its focus on fleshing out the characters. In every episode. You get to know more about the characters and they feel more and more alive and real as you get to know more about them and their interests, hobbies, and points of views. Their character designs may be cute, but Non Non Biyori doesn't rely on that to make characters endearing. It relies on fleshing out the character and making them have depth. I felt like I was with them right there. It is something that many anime fail to do, and it is truly stunning.\\n\\n\r\n   Non Non Biyori is definitely a beautifully crafted piece of art that should be viewed by not just fans of slice of life but fans of anime in general. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and experience the soothing experience known as Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\n   You know that an anime is good when every episode makes you grin uncontrollably and gives you that warm feeling inside, and Non Non Biyori does exactly that.",

            "content": "Who are we to decide that Slice of Life is a genre filled with shows that are all the same? Isn\u2019t there still a batch of examples that still have those same aspects of what makes Slice of Life and still create a fresh atmosphere and aura to its world and characters? The answer is quite simply: yes. There are still shows of this nature that do provide more than just cute girls doing cute things, though there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about it to begin with. To this, Non Non Biyori is one such show that fits the category perfectly as an instant slice oflife classic.\\n\\n\r\nOne phrase that perfectly summarizes the show as whole would be, a breath of fresh air. I mean that literally too. If there is one thing that does distinguish Non Non Biyori from most shows like it is the blissful atmosphere that engulfs the world of the show. From its character interactions being so grounded in real-life, down-to-earth manner that actually makes it more memorable and so real to the environment to the subtle hints of its artistry to the backgrounds and characters.  With the plot detailing the issues of differentiating what city life is like than the rural countryside areas of society, it doesn\u2019t necessarily paint a perfect demonstrated structure of how the plot goes. But if you look at it further down the road, that really isn\u2019t very necessary for this show. It just lets the plot speak for itself through normal day dialogue rather than pointless exposition to explain anything since there\u2019s hardly anything to explain in the first place. Sure, that might capsulize the slice of life genre as a whole, but Non Non Biyori is probably one of the few that does it better than the vast majority of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little plot that Non Non Biyori showcases makes up for the supreme colorful cast of characters that make the show worthwhile to watch all the way through. Every single girl has their own unique personality that distinguishes them from the rest in terms of how the writers build up to how their sense of humor is like in the comedy. They aren\u2019t just this mesh of girls that have personality A, B, or C, the difference of personality constructs them up to actually feeling like real human beings that anybody can relate to whether it be from their own disposition or their typical actions. Renge, for instance, is the youngest of the bunch and you\u2019d think that they\u2019d make her into this really young girl who acts older than her original age but it is, in fact, quite the opposite to this general aspect; at least in most cases to be specific. Her kindergarten mind ranges from being cute and curious that, in some cases, can be construed to how come kids at her age act in a civil manner.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding on my point about the artistry, the art is actually pretty breathtaking to look at considering how minimal the scope is to the show. It actually enhances the atmosphere greatly in its relaxed tone and inflection from how the characters look so crisp and clear from the actual colors and designs of them. The backgrounds especially give a wide range of detail into perfecting this countryside town in giving its structure more creativity and care to designing how the characters live through their day-to-day lives.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s quite unique about the comedy itself is how the timing is so minimal and slow that quickly makes the scenes more memorable just from the silence and pauses that lasts up to even about ten seconds. Again, the atmospheres helps to the show\u2019s credit with this in that the environment is so chill and down-to-earth that the jokes fit the show perfectly, even with its mild attempts at trying to be wacky in typical moe comedy fashion. That at least is always welcomed, thanks to the hilarious antics of Renge and Natsumi, who\u2019s air-headed ways always tickles the moe-bone whenever her actions are on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nCasting couldn\u2019t have been better to give these characters the voices that fits them very well to their archetypes. Highlights include Kana Asumi with her very distinct, sarcastic voice that matches very well to Komari\u2019s senpai attitude that all the other girls look up to her. Ayane Sakura has definitely made a name for herself in the seiyuu community by gracing her beautiful voice on the spotlight and she has done it once again with Natsumi, a role that was begging to be played by her; though it would be interesting to hear someone like Yui Ogura to play her as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, Non Non Biyori might be a big surprise for anyone who might be getting a little tired of the Slice of Life genre dominating the majority of the seasons lately. I myself am one of these people, though I don\u2019t necessarily have any contempt or hatred to all of the shows like this, but Non Non Biyori is a clear sign that the genre definitely has a lot of things going for it and reminds us why it\u2019s still considered a popular genre for so many people. One thing that the show does do amazingly right in slice of life, is perfectly capturing what it was like to be middle school aged kid. In that it does want us to remember what it was like being at that age filled with mystery and friends, or lack thereof. Most slice of life fail to capture this essence but we finally have one, and its name is Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Anime can fulfil many roles and act as many outlets for people. Non Non Biyori, simply put, is an experience that plays on the sweeter side of us all. For someone looking for a soothing, relaxing, cute and humorous adventure, there's a lot to get out of Non Non Biyori. Lovers of the moe slice of life genre will find something to love in this anime for sure. \r\nStory: (7/10; Not important): The thing about Non Non Biyori and many other slice of life that come in this style is that there is no real deep plot line filled with twists and turns. The free-flowingnature of the anime accentuates the calm and easy-going mood of the characters as living in the country-side. For a brief summary, Tokyo student Hotaru suddenly moves to the country side, and finds herself in a situation where she must adapt to life in the country side, where there's one candy shop, the supermarket has no cashiers and the classes are all mixed into one. The beauty of the story shines in the fact that it gives the anime lots of room to work, and a lot of situations are covered, allowing for the characters to fully shine and do what moe slice of life should do, be funny, be relaxing and bring into the world that's different than yours. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10): The art in the anime is beautiful. The country side is depicted very well, with a hefty amount of colors drawing from light color palettes. The art helps to enhance the mood as the backgrounds are intricate and the characters all have distinguishing details about them. Non Non Biyori shows the great potential of Slice of Life art in a heavy nature setting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): The setting of Non Non Biyori also plays heavily into the sound portion of things. You will commonly and frequently hear birds chirping in the morning and the sound of flowing water in streams and ponds. Along with that the soothing soundtrack filled with woodwind and acoustic guitar pieces will certainly only add to the experience. The music never really seems out of place in Non Non Biyori and it really helps to bring out the setting as well as define the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10): What makes or breaks a slice of life anime is usually the characters. If the characters are interesting, then the SoL probably won't be interesting. Luckily for us, Non Non Biyori has four very good characters. Each one of the characters has a unique personality, whether it be Hotaru's polite manner with an obsession over her senpai, or Renge with her fun-loving and care-free personality. You will quickly love all the characters, and find favorites among them, and they all have their moments which is something that Slice of Life animes in general should strive to do. They really shine in their interactions with each other and the way they tackle certain situations in a setting that should be pretty unfamiliar to most of us. The characters are light-hearted and happy, and are memorable until the end, offering a great experience for viewers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10): Even without a compelling and gripping plot, Non Non Biyori captured my heart immediately, and took me into the world of the Japanese country side. The characters made me laugh and for the brief 24 minutes, separated me from the stress of the real world. If you ask me, there is nothing more that a Slice of Life anime should strive for than this. The ability to grip the viewer in lack of a major plot and distract them from the real world with a thoroughly enjoyable environment with great characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8.5/10): It was really hard for me to choose between an 8 and a 9 here, so I figured I'd take the diplomat's road and give it right in the middle. Being an overall fan of anime, no matter what the genre, I always appreciated the drawn out, epic and mysterious plots of some of the very highly rated anime on MAL. However there will always be a place for Slice of Life anime, especially moe SoL. Fit with four very adorable characters, a unique setting, and many funny and cute experiences to treasure, I feel that Non Non Biyori will stand as one of the staples of moe slice of life anime. What's not to love? If you're feeling down, or want to please your sweet tooth of anime, go ahead, give Non Non Biyori a try. Come for the premise, leave with the interactions of four great characters. \\n\\n\r\nNyanpasu~",

            "content": "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out Non Non Biyori is a cute show about cute girls doing cute things. Even from the previews, discussion, and artwork, one can tell that the show depicts a slice of a life style circling a group of friends enjoying the time of their lives. It\u2019s no surprise that they live happily without the burden of of saving the world, going through multi-love polygons, or killing titans. A life on the countryside is very relaxing and so is this series. Non Non Biyori brings you stories about a group of young girls having fun and living their livesat fullest.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is an anime series based off of manga of the same name written by Atto. Silver Link handles the production that have recently achieved attention with their works such as Watamote, Fate/Kaleid, Dusk of Maiden etc. Likewise, these all share a similar setting taken place at school. However, Non Non Biyori doesn\u2019t have the burden of living in a city where there\u2019s crime, poverty, or hate; neither in the case does it evoke shock or horror. Instead, we got pleasurable atmosphere on the countryside where everyday is a brand new adventure.\\n\\n\r\nCalling this show \u2018cute\u2019 or \u2018adorable\u2019 isn\u2019t uncommon. After all, the series gives off that sense of innocence with our schoolgirls as the main characters. The youngest one among them is Renge Miyauchi, a first grader with a rather perspective view of what\u2019s around her. She also has a catchphrase ending many of her sentences with \u201cna non\u201d, a pun to the anime title. Renge can be defined as the show\u2019s mascot as she is the youngest yet also the most eye catching character in many of the episodes. Among its other main character cast includes the shy Hotaru Ichijou, Natsumi, and Komari of the Koshigaya siblings. All of them have different personalities but shares a bonding friendship that connects them together.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori clearly lacks any directional plot but it sets up its premise well. We have Hotaru Ichijou, a shy 5th grade elementary schoolgirl who just recently moved to the countryside. Being the new kid at school isn\u2019t easy especially with a class so small that all the students share the same classroom. There isn\u2019t a big story going on but we can quickly tell that Hotaru tries to adjust to her new environment. Renge seems to be the welcoming director as she plays the role of welcoming Hotaru to the new class. It\u2019s funny to see the position set up this way because of their age difference but a show like this pokes fun at anything. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having fun in this series because its style. It portrays the its slice of life genre quite well in this way and gives an appreciation to its settings and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also likes to poke the fun of the male population since there is almost none. Well, there is one guy in the show so far that is barely acknowledged for existence. His name is Suguru Koshigaya, a third grader with little presence at all. Unlike Kuroko from a certain basketball series, no one really seems to care about him either. \\n\\n\r\nFarm life isn\u2019t always either so sometimes throughout the series, we witness the characters out on the sun doing field work. Only this time, the girls seems to be taking responsibility. Take Renge for example. She is only in the first grade but clearly demonstrates that she can be wise even at time compared to their schoolteacher. It\u2019s laughable in this way since that means the majority of this series is dominated by the main characters rather than anyone else. And that would be true too as many of the times, we see our main characters in the spotlight with minimal amount of attention to other supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has a lot of comedy whether it might be the dialogues, responses, or character interactions. This is usually caused by misunderstandings, odd events, or situations. At the same time, there is also some tension bought out occasionally by Natsume. She plays more of a superior to others (especially her sister and brother) but at the same time is noticeable for her loving bond with everyone. There are also time when she tries to teach Renge some things not to be taught to a first grader. It\u2019s amusing to watch since the parents are almost in the complete background while the kids tries to play a role in guardianship. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its cuteness, the show can be somewhat repetitive to watch. There\u2019s also a lack of exploration in any of the characters\u2019 backgrounds. It seems to clearly focus on its slice of life style while retaining its cute interpretations. While, there\u2019s minimal fan service and negates the harem trope (despite there being one main male character), there\u2019s still the typical beach episode. Additionally, most of the episodes seems to lack any purpose or moral as they are all standalone. As the show is also focused directly at the countryside, there\u2019s nearly hardly anything else new besides the farm setting that is focused on. However, there are settings such as the house where the characters live, the school (with only one classroom being the focus),  a sunny beach, and a shrine. Typical as it is, the show doesn\u2019t try out new or exciting features that sets foot outside its SOL zone.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, Silver Link did an excellent job with its production with rich visuals. The countryside is presented with a calm atmosphere that illustrates the nature of being simple. Indeed, it\u2019s nothing like the heavily populated cities where there is pollution, crime, or poverty. Instead, there\u2019s a relaxing life with our four girls. Speaking of the girls, most of them are designed with a charming presence. Their diverse colored hairs and simple clothing contrasts with the stereotypical valley girl with heavy makeup. It\u2019s beautiful in its own way and that\u2019s what important.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t very impressive but sends its message well with the calm atmosphere. Most of the time, the OST is lighthearted whether it\u2019s with character interactions, conversations, or just the girls having fun. There are a few moments when we witness some more tense moments although most of this is downplayed as comedy because the show itself is created to bring out laughter and joy. The OP song \u201cNanairo Biyori\u201d by nano. Ripo is decorated with cuteness while its ED song has an unique style where the cast members whom plays the characters in the show sings its theme. Speaking of which, I also find most of the characters\u2019 voices to match well. Rie Murakawa brings out that voice of shyness in Hotaru\u2019s character while Kotori Koiawai portrays Renge as who she exactly is. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series is probably one of those anime that is overlooked compared to other mainstream series. Underrated wouldn\u2019t be a word I\u2019d describe Non Non Biyori. Instead, it\u2019s something that is likely slipped under people\u2019s radars. The fact that slice of life series with cute girls doing cute things has become a repetitive tropes in recent years. However, that idea can still be appreciated thanks to the characters of this series. The way they live countryside is simple and doesn\u2019t bring out a stressful way of portraying life. There is a lack of story depth but if one can overlook that will learn how to appreciate the way this series presents itself. It reaffirms the style of a slice of life anime without going over the bar. Sometimes in life, you just want to relax a bit and enjoy something simple. Luckily, there\u2019s shows like Non Non Biyori that can give just what you deserve. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Nothing can be objectively good, but enjoyment has to come from somewhere. Non Non Biyori is an anime that I really enjoyed but I don\u2019t know exactly why. I will be comparing it to other anime to see if I can figure out exactly what made it so enjoyable to me.\r\nThe story in Non Non Biyori is pretty simple: it\u2019s about a girl from Tokyo who moves to a rural part of the country, likely a hamlet. Although it\u2019s supposed to be about her getting used to her new lifestyle, this intent is lost fast and just like Akari from Yuru Yuri she eventually doesn\u2019teven seem like the protagonist anymore. It\u2019s not really a problem since in my opinion this anime works better with a group lead than a single protagonist at the head of the group, but the character introduced as the protagonist does seem to have the least characterization out of the main cast. It\u2019s a common theory that the setting is what makes it so enjoyable because it\u2019s relatable, but Tamako Market takes place in a town much more similar to my own and it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as enjoyable. I had some problems with Tamako Market since the main character was the only one with decent character development and generally not much going on, but there wasn\u2019t anything I can remember specifically about it that would make it that much worse than Non Non Biyori. The story of moving to a different place is a story that I can connect to since I once lived in Costa Rica for six months which has a very different culture and atmosphere than my own, but the exchanges in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Kiniro Mosaic, and Ikoku Meiro no Crois\u00e9e The Animation are much more similar to the situation I was in and I didn\u2019t enjoy any of them quite as much as Non Non Biyori. I definitely had problems with these anime as well: I didn\u2019t like the harem ending of Sakurasou, the accents in Kiniro Mosaic made the series feel fake, and Labyrinth felt more like a Japanese dub since it\u2019s set in France with French characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style could be a reason to like Non Non Biyori, after all the characters are very well designed and the background art is beautiful especially for such a long series. Starting with the character designs they all have realistic hair colours save Renge who despite having purple twintails fits in nicely with the art style. They\u2019re obviously drawn as lolis and are never sexualized. They would make better younger sisters than girlfriends. The eye size is pretty typical for a seinen moe anime and although it obviously isn\u2019t realistic it could arguably be the most attractive eye size in anime. Apart from Renge\u2019s triangle mouth their faces all look fairly similar, but their face shapes are still distinct enough that their hair isn\u2019t the only thing you can use to tell their head shots apart. The brother looks like a fairly generic anime boy and since he doesn\u2019t even have a voice actor I haven\u2019t felt any reason to remember his name. The two older characters Kaede, the candy store lady, and Kazuho, the teacher, have more unique designs than the main cast. Aside from how different the characters look from each other they all do have memorable designs even for a veteran of the moe genre such as myself. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider Non Non Biyori\u2019s designs to be my favourite designs, though. Anime adapted from video games such as Kantai Collection, Hyperdimension Neptunia, and Idolmaster have more attractive designs in my opinion. Apart from Aikatsu and Steins;Gate I can\u2019t remember any anime adapted from a video that was actually well made especially in terms of competing against Non Non Biyori. Kantai Collection dragged out and although it\u2019s lackluster storyline wasn\u2019t any worse than Non Non Biyori\u2019s absence of a solid story it still felt far less satisfying and halfway through I felt no drive to complete it. Hyperdimension Neptunia has some of the most beautiful character designs I\u2019ve seen, but the story fails to be engaging and as fun as the characters are to be with it wasn\u2019t that enjoyable of an anime. Idolmaster does have some character development and the story has some substance to it, but with 14 main characters and only 25 episodes it doesn\u2019t have enough time to give any of them that deep of characterization. Aikatsu I already consider to be better than Non Non Biyori so its strengths and weaknesses are irrelevant. Steins;Gate is adapted from a visual novel with a story that has many paths but only one of which was adapted into the anime. The story is good, the characters are designed well, and it\u2019s incredibly enjoyable, but for whatever reason I still rank it below Non Non Biyori. Steins;Gate is a very different series from Non Non Biyori, but the reasons I liked the two series still share a considerable amount of overlap. Both of the anime have likable characters and are set in a fairly small yet well developed area. Steins;Gate explores its setting by showing the characters changing the very world they live in through sending simple text messages and Non Non Biyori explores its setting by showing the characters travelling around through their little village and using different ways to indicate just how far apart different parts of their village are from each other. If the character design truly was the thing that made the anime so enjoyable then High School Fleet, the other anime Atto provided character designs for, should have been as enjoyable, but I found that anime to be quite mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art is very detailed, pretty, and shiny for an anime of its length. The three Makoko Shinkai films I\u2019ve seen, Five Centimetres Per Second, Your Name, and Garden of Words have just as beautiful of backgrounds if not more beautiful, but as movies they only have so much time to make an impact and as good as their art was the stories in them were either too complicated for their runtime or otherwise weren\u2019t quite as strong as what you would see in a series. The personalities of the characters aren\u2019t too detailed and only serve as ways to move the plot forward rather than being important contributions to the enjoyability of the anime. The three anime series I distinctly remember as having as good of background art as Non Non Biyori are Yama no Susume, Glasslip, and Anohana. I know, it\u2019s not everyday that someone would willingly compare their favourite anime to Glasslip, but I think it\u2019s for the best. The first season of Yama no Susume has good backgrounds but is too short to draw any conclusions from; the second season I consider to be better than Non Non Biyori and therefore isn\u2019t important for comparison. Glasslip is infamous for being far more uneventful than even anime like K-On! and Lucky Star. I think it would be safe to say that even if the background art was among the most important factors towards my enjoyment that all of the turn-offs in Glasslip would make it unenjoyable to even the people who valued background art the most, but there are still some people who enjoy Glasslip sincerely so it can\u2019t simply be turned down as an anime impossible to enjoy no matter what your tastes. Not only does Glasslip not have any real characterization, but the intent of it being a supernatural romance is sort of forgotten about and nothing really happens throughout the series. In addition to no value in the storytelling there also weren\u2019t any successful attempts at comedy. Anohana is a much better anime than Glasslip, but it still fails in a number of ways. The characters were interesting and well drawn, but the story of a dead friend who only the protagonist was incredibly unrealistic. My theory that Menma\u2019s spirit was actually audio-only and Jintan was simply imagining her in physical form was shattered by the end due to conflicting information. Non Non Biyori doesn\u2019t have any unexplained supernatural elements to bother me, but even anime with seemingly flawless magic systems like Death Note and Shigofumi rank lower on my list, but I won\u2019t go into explaining those.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the background art so important in Non Non Biyori is where the anime takes place. The setting is quite unique and it\u2019s the only slice of life anime I\u2019ve seen set in a such a unique place that doesn\u2019t have something to do with careers. Shirobako, Bartender, and Barakamon have similar settings, but Shirobako and Bartender are fairly slow and information heavy. Barakamon I saw right after Non Non Biyori and although there wasn\u2019t really anything wrong with it I still didn\u2019t enjoy it quite as much. As I was explaining before, Non Non Biyori does a lot with its small world. Unlike anime such as Sword Art Online and Gurren Lagann that have too big of a world to handle correctly the characters and the director do a good job at getting you to know where everything is without having to go everywhere in near-real time like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Having too small of a world can also be a problem. Seitokai no Ichizon takes place in a single room for the first few episodes and even when they do the school doesn\u2019t feel as natural or well laid out as the village in Non Non Biyori. I actually found the comedy in Seitokai no Ichizon to be comparable to if not better than the comedy in Non Non Biyori, but I still didn\u2019t think it was as good of an anime. The protagonist in Elemi is an inanimate object so naturally the movement in the anime was extremely limited no matter how good the writing was.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the places in Non Non Biyori feel like places I could really go to. The candy store not only reminds me of real candy stores that I\u2019ve been to but the aesthetic of it and the way everything is organized truly feels so well put together that even if I hadn\u2019t seen other stores like it that wouldn\u2019t make it any less believable. The bridge they jump off of feels nostalgic despite the fact that I\u2019ve only done things in real life that were remotely similar. The scene is written in a way that I could see myself in that situation just through the shared sense of that kind of childish innocence. When they go to the little hole in the wall and talk about how they had done that before when they were younger I relate to that sense of nostalgia in a way that I haven\u2019t really seen in other anime. Sure, there are some anime that I saw as a kid and are pieces of my childhood and therefore nostalgic to look back on, but I can\u2019t remember any other anime that really go into that sense of realistic nostalgia the characters have around things in their own world. Dagashi Kashi did that a bit, but the monster of the week style of it made it feel a bit too fake for it to hit me in that same way. I have very strong memories of playing with my cousin up at his dad\u2019s (or my uncle\u2019s) cabin. In the summer we played around the lake getting mucky, we went under a bridge and blew up firecrackers that we stuck to the bridge with clay, and we found tadpoles in the pond. In the winter we used the firecrackers in the snow, we went on the frozen lake on snowmobiles, and we sledded down hills on waxed cardboard. We also play games like the \u201csuicide notes\u201d game where we would jump off a loft and say why were killing ourselves and then would drink something to \u201crevive\u201d us. These years didn\u2019t just blend into one another since I would look forward to the next time I would go up there and would always go with fond memories of the previous trips. The nostalgia wasn\u2019t just additive, it was magnified through the nostalgia of nostalgia itself. The characters have cell phones and are obviously living in the modern day and age, but you can still watch the anime as if it is through the eyes of the characters looking back on their childhood.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the school uniforms and the buildings themselves are rather unique. One important thing to note is that since the school has both elementary school and middle school students they don\u2019t all wear the same uniform, in fact if weren\u2019t for the flashback that showed Kaede wearing the uniform it could have been assumed that it was just how Natsumi and Komari\u2019s parents decided to dress them. In the whole school there is only one male, but it isn\u2019t a harem and not only is he not that important of a character he doesn\u2019t have single line and is only used for comedy. With the male and female uniforms in consideration they\u2019ve both designed nicely. Renge and Hotaru don\u2019t wear the uniform but the clothing they do wear looks good. The school\u2019s design is quite interesting. It\u2019s quite small and only has a few rooms. It feels quite natural and as poorly as it is taken care of the internal structure isn\u2019t too chaotic. For a schoolgirl not too much of the anime takes place in the school. I think this works to its benefit since their lives outside of school are more interesting, but the time they\u2019re shown in school isn\u2019t wasted and their pathetic excuse for a teacher is charming in her own way.\\n\\n\r\nApart from anime based around music like So Ra No Wo To and Nerima Daikon Brothers it can be hard to know just how much the quality of the sound is affecting your enjoyment, but I feel like the voice acting and background music in this anime really did make a difference. This is an anime I think would lose a lot in an English dub if it were to ever receive one. The very first scene has Renge playing a recorder completely out of tune, which sets the tone for the series very well. Renge\u2019s \u201cnyanpasu\u201d doesn\u2019t have any nice sounding English equivalent, sort of like how off Nico\u2019s \u201cNico-Nico-Nii\u201d sounds in the English dub of Love Live. Like most moe anime the cuteness of their voices is just as important to the series as the cuteness of their character designs. Komari\u2019s slight tsundere lilt has a nice sound to it even if her personality doesn\u2019t feel super realistic. Little things like rocks being thrown and water splashing all sound realistic enough but also don\u2019t have that problem where instead of imagining the sound in their world you would be able to tell that someone had to use a microphone to create that sound effect. Renge\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t have as big of a range as the other characters, but she still expresses a lot of emotion. Chocotto Sister and Saki I also liked the voices, sound effects, and music in, but they just didn\u2019t feel like as strong of series overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat analysis would be complete with taking apart the animation of the opening theme? As much as I doubt a good OP could provide the sole enjoyment for a show especially considering how good the OPs for anime like Absolute Duo,  Lord Marksman and Vanadis, and Golden Time were compared to how little I actually enjoyed those anime, but I do believe the openings to this were really well made and at least made some contribution to my enjoyment of the anime. The OP starts off by showing the river the series is set near which gives a bit of information about the setting right off the bat since you wouldn\u2019t normally see rivers like that in the city, especially without any pollution and being surrounded by rocks rather than concrete. I know the OP doesn\u2019t actually start at the beginning of the first episode, but it still does give a good introduction to the series in addition to what we see of the anime before the OP starts. After the first shot we are shown the sky with clouds to further the idea that this is set in the semi-wilderness of a quaint hamlet. The title is shown in a colourful and bubbly font similar to the kind that an elementary school student might use to write their name. I think this might be nodding towards the fact that the main characters are younger than our typical 15-17 year olds these anime tend to revolve around. We see a can being kicked, a reference to the popular kids\u2019 game \u201ckick the can\u201d, and then shows Natsumi with a grin implying that she was the one who kicked it. The students start running and the teacher stands there dazed as if ignorant to her job as \u201cit\u201d or even to the rules of the game in general. Throughout the series the teacher is constantly shown as being less competent than the students she has been assigned to teach so her inability to suppress her apathy in order to just properly play a game with some children says a lot about her character. Considering how unathletic she has been shown to be it\u2019s surprising that the can even needed to be kicked in the first place, but she obviously didn\u2019t do a good job at protecting it. Even with their failure of a teacher playing the key role in their game, they still seem to be enjoying themselves more than any normal adult has in years. They try hard to run away as fast as they can even though \u201cit\u201d is making no effort to chase after them whatsoever. How easy it is for them to have fun really plays into the series and in a way can even metaphorically describe how I feel about the series as a whole since despite how little seems to be going on in it the anime is still extremely enjoyable. The next scene shows the students playing music, cooking, and playing all under the limited supervision of their teacher. Although the teacher has her eyes permanently closed, she is shown to be sleeping in the last of these three events by having a bubble coming out of her nose and giving her a more joyous look on her face than usual. Again, the kids seem to be enjoying these activities, but considering how poorly Renge was shown playing the recorder in the first scene it\u2019s a given that whatever skills they\u2019re meant to be learning in these situations are taught in an ineffective manner. They are then shown walking in the rain with umbrellas and next the picture changes to a puddle showing the kind of weather that they typically get in that area. They are then shown relaxing in the shade of a tree with a ball visible showing that they were playing some sort of game and got tired. We then see a train go by in the background and it is shown that Hotaru was riding it. I think this is used to show the cultural distance between her and the other characters. She looks solemnly at the scenery through the window as it passes by. Natsumi is shown sitting on a tree branch and looking out at the sunset. The next image shows Komari inside reading a book while hiding away from the rain, which is clearly a common occurrence in the place they live. Renge hangs up a teru teru bozu, a Japanese spiritual ornament intended to keep the rain away. This not only shows that she would rather it not be raining despite relying somewhat on the rain for crop growth but also that she believes this little handmade figure will actually work to make the skies clear again. Although in Japan the teru teru bozu is a well known symbol we don\u2019t see it in many anime. I\u2019m going to speculate that most teenagers in Japan don\u2019t trust this figure to help any and considering all the other Japanese cultural traditions that rely on faith that Japanese teenagers will participate in I think this specific one is likely seen as particularly childish. The four main characters are then shown lined up on a bridge and they take turns jumping into the river. Hotaru is reluctant to join at first, but she quickly gives. This scene is also shown in the series, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a spoiler simply because of the apparent storyless structure of the anime. The manga wasn\u2019t even adapted chronologically, hence the name \u201cRepeat\u201d for the sequel, and it never really needed to be since it\u2019s not important what order the events happened in. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious what this scene is meant to show. Hotaru isn\u2019t too into this idea, but she still wants to join her friends in an activity that they\u2019re all used to. The next scene shows the characters staring blankly at the camera for a couple seconds before eating what look like cookies in perfect unison. This could be to show how in sync they\u2019ve become, but even without any deeper meaning they looking really cute doing that together. Natsumi and Renge have a snowball fight. Natsumi misses her shot and Renge picks a snowball far too big for her to feasibly use as a weapon. Natsumi looks frightened, but seeing the way Renge staggers back it doesn\u2019t look like she would be able to throw it very far if at all. In the background we see Komari crying while Hotaru cleans the snow off of her that she was once covered with. We never see this full scene in the show itself, but even this little snapshot makes for an interesting tale. The concept of a girl having snow piled onto her fits in with the show so well I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was something from the manga that simply wasn\u2019t able to be adapted. We end with Natsumi jumping on large colourful tires that have been positioned to be played on. The scenes are set up in a way to show all four seasons of the year wrapped up into 90 seconds. I don\u2019t pay enough attention to opening animations to give examples of similar openings to compare this to.\\n\\n\r\nLike most slice of life anime this puts a very big importance on the characters, both how likable they are as individuals and how they interact with each other. I will be talking about the four main characters as well as the more prevalent supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is introduced to us as the main character. She\u2019s from Tokyo as are 25% of the total population of Japan and the majority of the anime studios. She lives with her parents and has a healthy family relationship, much like the rest of the characters. Although the parents aren\u2019t too important of characters, it is important to note that they\u2019re all alive and still together since a lot of anime feature main casts that don\u2019t have complete families. One of Hotaru\u2019s defining features is how mature she looks for her age. Personality wise she more closely matches her chronological age than her visual age. She has a crush on Komari even to the point of making plush dolls of her. This seems more like yuri fanservice than a legitimate attempt to give her character more depth, but even if it does break the illusion of reality it still never bothered me. In fact, I found this little bit of romance to be kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nRenge is a rather unique character. Some call her the most realistic child in anime, although she still isn\u2019t quite as believable as Rin from Usagi Drop. She is significantly younger than the rest of the main cast, but they still manage to be normal friends without seeing her as being less important. She does have certain childish needs that the others will often have to cater to. She acts like a bit of a younger sister to all of them even though the only other character related to her is their teacher. Pretty much everything she does looks so heartwarming and innocent that it\u2019s easy to ignore how weird she would look in real life. She could be referred to as a loli, but she isn\u2019t sexualized in any way. This anime is made for adult men and much unlike anime such as Ro-Kyu-Bu the characters are intended to be as innocent and realistic as would make sense for the context. Considering the fact that school swimsuits are more fetishized in Japan than bikinis it still could be considering sexual in that way, but it would still be disturbing for people to fap to it.\\n\\n\r\nKomari isn\u2019t exactly a cliche character, but she does follow a lot of tropes. She has a strong complex around being a loli and doesn\u2019t like being the older sister who looks like a little kid. Just like Ed from Fullmetal Alchemist she freaks out about her height frequently and although as a comedy anime this isn\u2019t exactly misplaced it is a pretty generic character trait. It\u2019s supposed to be funny, but since any audience member who has seen at least a handful of anime like this is already used to that joke it loses its value as a joke and just becomes an annoyance. Just like any other moe or harem anime she complains about her breast size and she is envious of Hotaru who has much larger breasts than her despite a few years younger. Unlike Lucky Star, Toradora, and Yuru Yuri that were willing to go so far to actually turn the flat chestedness of a character into an important part of the show or even a major plot point this anime just passes it off as something you should come to expect from these types of anime and doesn\u2019t do anything with it. I\u2019m not saying that Chuu Bra is a good anime because it was brave enough to make its entire plot revolve around breasts, but I think it\u2019s better if an anime actually does something with the tropes it incorporates rather than just inserting harem light novel humour into an anime where that isn\u2019t warranted. These things wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem if she had more going on, but the fact is that her entire character is based around the standard imouto stereotypes. For whatever reason none of this bothered me all that much when I was watching the series. In retrospect I recognise that she wasn\u2019t that well written, but unlike Sword Art Online that I\u2019ve come to consider much worse upon noticing its flaws after the fact this hasn\u2019t made me feel like any of my enjoyment was any less deserved than when I watched the anime. She has yaeba and considering the fact that the town hasn\u2019t been shown to have a hospital or even a properly functional school I don\u2019t think anyone would care to \u201cfix\u201d it or even see it as a problem that needs a solution.\\n\\n\r\nNatsumi is Komari\u2019s younger sister and is the youngest child in her family. Surprisingly despite how realistic this anime is said to feel she\u2019s the only character in the main cast who doesn\u2019t just feel like some anime character. This isn\u2019t to say that she\u2019s a boring character, though. She acts exactly how you would expect a girl her age to act. You could see it as a good thing that they aren\u2019t all just normal people because it does make their characters a bit more fun even if they wouldn\u2019t fit well in reality. She takes good care of Renge and generally gets along well with the other characters. As shown in the OP she\u2019s considered to be fairly adventurous and athletic.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character I will talk about is Komari and Natsumi\u2019s brother who seems so insignificant that I can\u2019t even remember his name. Aside from Hotaru\u2019s father he\u2019s the only male character we know about in the entire town. He\u2019s quite reserved and doesn\u2019t even have a voice actor since he never speaks. He participates in activities with the other characters and in one episode he\u2019s shown to be quite dextrous. Although he\u2019s almost like a main character, because he doesn\u2019t speak or interact much with the other characters it\u2019s hard to remember much about him. He\u2019s pretty much only used comedy and any scene where he isn\u2019t just a background character he isn\u2019t exactly treated well. For an anime with a single male character surrounded by cute girls he doesn\u2019t seem too thrilled and for all we know he might be asexual. If we assume he isn\u2019t he doesn\u2019t have many options anyway. Komari and Natsumi are his sisters so they\u2019re off limits, Renge is far too young for him, and Hotaru is a lesbian. Kaede the candy lady is only six years older than him so she could be a potential partner, but I don\u2019t know how good of a couple they would make. Hotaru might be bisexual, but she seems a bit too obsessed with Komari to be interested in getting into a relationship with him. There was the vegetable stand that is put out by other people and we have seen busses with drivers that are most likely from that town so I don\u2019t think the characters we have seen are the only residents, but it isn\u2019t clear just how many other people live there or how many dating options he has if they were to keep the town going for more generations.\\n\\n\r\nKaede who is also known as \u201cthe candy store lady\u201d is a young woman who runs the local corner store that the main characters will buy candy from. She graduated from the local school and has a close connection with Renge. In addition to candy she does sell some other things in her store, but we haven\u2019t seen too much else being sold there nor have we even seen any of the adults shopping there. It was shown that she has a kitchen attached to the store and with the way it\u2019s set up you can tell that she actually does live there. She was first introduced as just some storekeeper, but she later became an important cast member and has gone on different outings with the other characters. It is unknown what other customers she has that aren\u2019t the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe school teacher is another important character. She is Renge\u2019s older sister. Being only four years older than Kaede she was likely taught at the same time but we don\u2019t know who taught the class before her. She seems like the most incompetent teacher and is often shown sleeping when she\u2019s supposed to be teaching. I\u2019m sure we all have had substitute teachers who do nothing but just give out worksheets for students to complete rather than actually teaching partly because the actual teacher isn\u2019t expecting a single day of poor teaching to be that much of a detriment, but she is the main teacher and even worksheets would do a better job than her teaching style. When you think about how dysfunctional the teacher is it\u2019s hard to overlook how the rest of the school is run. Japanese schools are cleaned by the students rather than janitors and their school doesn\u2019t seem well taken care of. The roof leaks and the floorboards can even give way. Who knows how old the school uniforms are. They don\u2019t look like they have much wear, but even though Hotaru is about the same size as the other girls she was never offered a uniform so it might be that they were all being used. There\u2019s only one male student so there might be a male uniform laying around that she could wear with her own skirt, but either no one thought of that or it might be that the only reason the ones we see don\u2019t look torn up is because they go through periodic repairs.\\n\\n\r\nAs redundant as it may seem in an piece of writing that is intended to deconstruct my enjoyment of the series there still are a few things related to enjoyment that I haven\u2019t gone into much depth yet. The humour in this anime is often cited as being one of its strengths. The raw enjoyment that comes from the situations and random jokes differs a fair and is actually a bit weaker than the comedy in Sansha Sanyou and Joshiraku. These two anime don\u2019t really have anything wrong with them that would noticeably tick me off, but I still don\u2019t consider them to be as good of anime. One thing I appreciate about Non Non Biyori is how naturally the characters grow on you. Sure, it is a common trope for a character to join a new group of people at the beginning so the introductions make sense, but unlike anime such as Code Geass and No Game No Life where even the protagonists are secretive about their true intentions the characters in this show are up front about themselves and we learn about them in a similar way to how you would learn more about your friends or coworkers in real life. I think it\u2019s really nice and relaxing to get to know unrealistic characters in such a natural way. Anime like Anne Happy and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei introduce the characters just fine, but because all of the characters represent something different they don\u2019t feel like real people. I know anime like Log Horizon have realistic characters in an unrealistic environment which is a good combination, but it doesn\u2019t feel quite as good.\\n\\n\r\nMy second point for the enjoyment section will be continuing on my comparison to Steins;Gate. Steins;Gate is well written and doesn\u2019t have that visible of flaws, but after this analysis I understand why I didn\u2019t like it as much as Non Non Biyori. The characters are well written and have interesting and realistic personalities, but the way they're used doesn\u2019t leave me with the same fuzzy feeling Non Non Biyori gives me. Two of the characters die multiple times and one of the characters even changes from male to female not through a sex operation but by artificially changing their embryo to xx after it was already fertilized, something that is only possible through flawed Japanese mythology. I know I had some negative things to say about Non Non Biyori, but for a show with a magic system so well explained it disturbs me to see things that don\u2019t work in our world and aren't explained in theirs. These specific things ticked me off in the show because of how tight the rest of the logic is. Just like the difference between cobblestone and a near-perfect sidewalk with a couple cracks the individual flaws are more noticeable and memorable in Steins;Gate than in very flawed anime like Vividred Operation, Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu., or Date a Live. The story in Steins;Gate is almost possible so the couple problems were a bit disappointing. In comparison Non Non Biyori doesn't have a story to begin with and all of its flaws fall within the realm it has set out for itself. Its simplicity is in itself a strength because it doesn't require the viewer to suspend their disbelief that much in order to get maximum enjoyment from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important reasons about why I like Non Non Biyori so much more than similar anime is the way it enabled me to connect with my past nostalgia and how well it avoids balatant mistakes as well as being able to cover up its smaller existing ones. As far from reality as the characters may be they are still super cuddly and fun to be around. They really feel like they belong in their world. Although I was skeptical at first as to why I held this anime to such a high regard I still believe it\u2019s just as good as I did when I first saw it with my brother on a plane over a year ago. I have also watched Ghost Stories (dub) with him and although I loved that anime it still wasn\u2019t quite as good so I don\u2019t think just watching it with him would be too big of an impact. The songs were great and the way they show all four seasons was a nice touch.\\n",

            "content": "When first encountered by Non Non Biyori, I instantly had the thought that something mediocre were to appear as with (obviously a biased perspective) most modern slice of life shows. Boy was I wrong though, because if you're anything like me and enjoy a good, relaxing slice of life show that makes you feel good, cosy and just want to keep watching... Well, you're in the right place.\r\nNon Non Biyori revolves around a really simple story, where we're met by Renge and her friends, and we follow them throughout their daily lives in the sticks. It really doesn't get any more complex than that, andit's one of the main reasons as to why I had such a great time watching this show. You don't have to worry about figuring some mystery out, or the story having any real plotholes for that matter. To me, a slice of life show should be as simple as possible and focus on the characters that make the show enjoyable, which is the case in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn first look I was met with stunning visuals. I really recommend watching this in 720p or above, if you have the opportunity to. The artwork really is splendid, and they focus a whole lot on drawing beautiful scenery and backgrounds, something that you might not necessarily focus on but it does add a nice touch. The characters are animated in a high quality fashion as well, although it's debatable whether or not the derpy faces are \"high quality\". I think they are, however, since the exaggeration of expressions is sort of... Out of character? It makes for a great laugh when used properly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect that sort of caught me off guard was how good the music fits in this happy-go-lucky show. If you've seen Hanasaku Iroha and recognize the opening, that's because it's the same artist. I also get the same vibe as I did from Hanasaku Iroha as I do for Non Non Biyori, which might be a factor in this subjective review, but the music really does wonders. Although simple, it suits the (more often than not) quirky situations depicted. Great when it's time to laugh, and great when it's time to feel good or emotional.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, however, the far most important moment that makes Non Non Biyori excel are the characters. They're all unique with their own traits, good and bad, and they all share a common element; they're all quirky, to some degree. You really get to bond with them as well during the course of the show, something I really appreciated. The show really wouldn't be the same without them, which should be obvious considering that it's slice of life, but it's not as obvious in other shows (the way I see it).\\n\\n\r\nSo, to summarize, Non Non Biyori is a wonderful, short story about Renge and her friends' daily lives and struggles. With a simple story, stunning visuals, sound fit for the situations and characters that you just want to see more and more of, Non Non Biyori instantly hooks you on and before you know it you'll have watched the 12 episodes. Twice. A slice of life done right.\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but give this anime 10/10.",

            "content": "I felt at a loss when I looked at this season's anime lineup. It seemed crowded with a lot of action and supernatural-oriented shows, two genres I don't generally mesh well with, so when I saw Non Non Biyori it instantly stood out. Being a fan of the gentle, Ichigo Mashimaru-styled slice of life style, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. \r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nStory is never a strong suit in a genre that is based around nothing really happening. Non Non Biyori doesn't bring profound storyboard elements to the table, but you can't really expect that. It instead seems tooffer very subtle undertones based on the premise of country life. The show follows Ichijou Hotaru, a 5th grader who has moved from the city to the country, and her friends, who happen to be the only other gradeschool children in town. Concepts of culture shock are touched upon lightly in Hotaru's occasional confusion of life in the country, and the connection between the main characters seems strengthened by the loneliness of being in such an underpopulated location. Story is taken lightly, as I feel it should be.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nMother of all that is holy, those backgrounds. I feel this is one of Non Non's strong suits, that being the art. A peaceful, countryside setting offers stunning scenery, and this show does not shy away from taking advantage of that. The first part of the first episode greets us with a collage of beautiful mountains coated in trees, gentle streams, and peaceful fields. The style of the characters themselves is solid and very cute, and the animation is fluid and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Non Non complements the atmosphere of the show very well. It's peaceful, quaint, and traditional. The only complaint I have is the more intense music in episode 5, but it wasn't very much of a big deal. The voices of the characters are pleasant and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nHere's where the slice of life genre shines, and Non Non doesn't fail to deliver. The anime is centric around four characters; Ichijou Hotaru, a mild-mannered fifth grader from the city, Koshigaya Natsumi, the playful sixth grader, Koshigaya Komari, the older sister of Natsumi, and Miyauchi Renge, the eccentric first grader. Each character has something interesting about them, such as Hotaru's loving obsession with her senpai Komari, Komari's sensitivity about her short stature, Natsumi's carefree nature, and Renge's... well, a lot about her is interesting. These traits are brought out through the interactions between characters in a fun, natural way.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show. It has the peace of a really gentle slice of life, but surprisingly has the ability to get me laughing or even tearing up a bit (looking at you, episode 4.) It achieves this in a subtle way that I just love to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI look forward to future episodes of Non Non Biyori. It's certainly my favorite anime of the season, and for good reason. If you liked Ichigo Mashimaru, then I feel you'd enjoy this show too.",

It's just amazing!\r\nWhen I started watching it I was down, and really tired from work and life, and I won't be exaggerating if I said this anime helped me through it! Not many shows put you in a lighter mood right away, and Non Non Biyori managed to do that every episode! I would automatically relax, and prepare myself to smile for 23 minutes and 40 seconds. It became a habit of me watching every second of that show, and it's the first time I didn't skip thestarting and ending theme, who would skip such cuteness?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime were all such unique and pure characters you'd never get sick of them, you'd want to watch each one of them more, and at one point, they all become your childhood best friends. And the character design is spot on! I guarantee you'll end up falling in love with every single character. Not to mention that the little side stories are to live for!\\n\\n\r\nWhen it come to the art style, you won't believe how magical a still image could look like until you watch this. I wished to live in the country more times than not watching this anime and looking at all the beautiful scenery. And of course the sounds are spot on, I live in a more of rural area, and whenever I heard the birds in the background, I thought I'm listening to the birds outside my windows, they were just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you ever want to just relax, smile like crazy, and just feel like the world could be an amazingly beautiful place. Or if you're just feeling down, and need a gentle hug, watch this anime, and you wouldn't be disappointed. I'm just happy there is a second season, because honestly when this one ended it felt like I was saying goodbye to my childhood friends and memories.",

That may  mean achieving a balance between career, the work of fulfilling yourself and relaxation, the work of being proud of what you did. Our enjoy life in a blissfull ignorance doing their daily chores or enjoying the littlepleasures of the countryside routine. While it may not be a dashing tale of courage or ambition I have noticed that the story focuses more on creating an authentic lifestyle and not an ideal type.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment of the series is equally divided between all the contributing factors. As such more attention has been awarded to the artwork, attention that can be witnessed through the many breathtaking background scenes while character designs have been made to fit the story plain and simple with nothing out of the ordinary\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have a linear evolution in the series being already formed and acting through the prism of their own personality. Being children means that their acts involve goofing around, dodging chores, having fun in any way they can.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the series because it evokes both a happy early life as well as a happy late life it is both the past and the future and it is something... to ponder on.\\n\\n\r\nSo would you like to come fish a good time with us?.. there is plenty of room and equipment",

            "content": "Simple mundane life can be a beautiful thing. We don't realize it, but every single day, we experience things that shape us as people, and we have always experienced those things, ever since we were born. While I love watching a heartfelt drama, a showcase of the bigger events that can inform our most important decisions and cause the most visceral emotions, we often take for granted how valuable and important the moments in between the drama are for us. Non Non Biyori, and its sequel series Repeat, highlight all of the meaningful moments that we often take for granted. It does numerous things tocreate its nostalgic tone, create a lived-in setting, and make its characters come to life, while being one of the most hilarious and occasionally heartfelt shows out there. Few series are capable of evoking the kinds of emotions NNB does for me, and through watching its young characters grow up in the countryside and experience the milestones of childhood, it makes me appreciate my life all the more. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Non Non Biyori's artwork and character designs are bright and colorful, it doesn't take long to see that the series general tone is also infused with a tinge of melancholy, and that unique bittersweet tone is almost always there in the background. This is because every aspect of Non Non Biyori's design is made to evoke the Japanese aesthetic concept called Mono no Aware. Sounds weeby, I know, but I think this concept is vital to understanding why Non Non Biyori is so memorable and emotional. Mono no Aware is about the meaning found in things that are fleeting, about how things are beautiful because they don't last forever, and as sad as it is that things change, it was better to have experienced them at all and allow them to become memories. This aesthetic is a staple in Iyashikei anime, and many of these series are set in a location where its easy to convey this feeling. Anything involving the passage of time will do the trick, which is why most Iyashikei anime are either set in nature, or in a post-apocalyptic setting, and Non Non Biyori's setting allows the series to constantly be reminding us about the passage of time. Being set around a large, natural environment means that things such as the changing of seasons are always seen visually. As each episode passes, you will notice that more leaves are starting to fall off of trees, or the color palette changes as the sun shines in different ways. The characters activities usually relate to whatever season it is, and seeing how all of this changes over the course of the series evokes the bittersweet sensation of Mono no Aware. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big part of Non Non Biyori's tone is how run-down it is. Around all of the gorgeous nature, Non Non Biyori is set in a run-down farm town. Small, half-destroyed houses and shacks can be found in the background, and there is a sensation that there used to be far more people in this rural town then there currently are. The school the students use has broken floorboards, the signs have been written on and are cracked or off their hinges, and the place in general looks like its been eroded. Not only does this serve as excellent worldbuilding, filling this setting with odd details and making it feel lived-in, but it also helps to convey that it used to be very different, and that over time, it's changed. Though more obvious, a big thing that shows how this place has changed over time is the older characters. There aren't any high school students anymore, as they have all moved to Tokyo to go to school, only coming back to visit occasionally, all in episodes that further flesh out the history of the characters and reinforce the passage of time. Instead, it focuses on young children, or younger adults. \\n\\n\r\nMost anime about cute girls doing cute things features high-school aged characters and light coming-of-age elements. Most of these characters face some hardships about their future, and their responsibilities in school. These stories can be engaging in their own right, and many times can form the crux of a very emotional coming-of-age story (see K-On), but that's not quite what Non Non Biyori is going for. Non Non Biyori ages its characters younger than most series, ranging from the First Grader Renge to the Eighth Grader Komari, with side characters who are all older with only a few exceptions. As young kids with much fewer responsibilities, their general personalities get more opportunities to come out, and they get to act their age: like children. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girls in this show feels like how a real child that age would act, and it makes them all more endearing and relatable. Hotaru is a 5th grader who moves to this rural village and adjusts to country life. At first, it seems she's mature and has it set, but as the series goes on we get to see her childish side come out more and more often. She idolizes the oldest girl Komari, she's gullible and falls for numerous tricks, she's curious about many things, and she gets clingy and overly whiny at times, especially around her mother. She acts differently around every character, and is in general a multi-faceted individual who feels like a believable child. The same is true for the tomboyish and troublesome Natsumi, and the wannabe adult Komari. The best example though, is Renge, who is the heart and soul of this series and a big part of what makes this series emotional core work so well. A bright and shiny first grader, Renge is overly curious and goes to explore everything she can find. She constantly asks questions, runs around on her own to find new things, takes advice from other characters way too seriously, and has an insanely random mind and will say the most insane things that almost make no sense. She's artistic, questioning, observant, and constantly taken aback by everything she experiences, looking at the world with a sense of wonder and fascination that only someone as young as her can see, as she is still learning about life and her surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest appeal of this series is in watching each of these characters grow up, experiencing the milestones that come with going through childhood. Most of these are light-hearted and fun, with very simple life lessons and a look at those days we wish we could return to, but they are treated with care and emotion. For example, one episode is about Natsumi dragging her sister to run away from home after getting blamed for something she didn't do. The two go to a hideout they made and talk for a bit, before reminiscing about the last time they had run away like this. They eventually realize that they can't really do anything without their mom, and juxtaposed with a cat feeding her kittens, the two realize they were acting like idiots and return home. Expecting to get scolded by an angry mama, instead, the two get head-pats and treated to a warm, home-cooked meal by a mother who was worried sick about her kids. It's heartwarming, nostalgic, and something I think anyone can relate to. Each of the series various plots are like that, ranging from a young Renge making a friend and eventually having to see her leave, to everyone looking back at old toys and photos/videos and cringing at how dumb they used to be. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest reason for the success of this series nostalgic and bittersweet tone is in the side characters. Like I said, this is a series about watching these children grow up, and the children themselves can't really see how much they're growing. But the older characters sure can, and in seeing their relationships we get a look into how things have changed. This is most apparent in the relationship between Renge and Kaede, aka Candy Store. Having been made to raise Renge when she was only 2, the two have formed a special, inseparable bond, and many of the series most emotional moments come when Renge goes to Candy Store for certain things. As Renge's own parents are constantly working in the rice fields and her sister is always sleeping and lazy, she experiences many of her own childhood milestones with Candy Store, such as learning to ride a bike. Candy Store is watching the young Renge grow up right before her eyes, and there's a bitter-sweetness to this, knowing that while Renge won't have that sense of adorable childlike wonder anymore, she's moving to better things. Really, Renge is an encapsulation of the emotional core of this series, and I can go on about how fantastic of a character she is and how she embodies everything I love about this series (a certain episode about tadpole shrimps comes to mind). Just suffice it to say that watching her grow and learn about life was satisfying and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nI may make it sound kind of emotional, but really Non Non Biyori is light-hearted and funny. Actually, it's hilarious. Non Non Biyori has some of the best comedic timing I've seen, and basically every punchline hits and hits hard. What I love about its comedy is how restrained it can be. The series will often utilize long pauses before the characters react to something, and that reaction will usually be a bit more relaxed or deadpan than whats normal for cute girls. Beyond that, the characters are wonderfully expressive, with adorable facial expressions and specific body language that makes them a joy to hang out with beyond feeling like realistic, multi-faceted child characters. Much of the comedy also plays into the feeling of nostalgia the series emits. I remember getting way to serious about games involving school supplies as a kid, and making random games out of stupid things. It's both hilarious and nostalgic then, to see a game of \"flip the ruler\" morph into a super hype sports anime, or one of the older characters tease Renge by pretending she removed her thumb. Some of the comedy can be random, usually involving Renge's wondering thoughts, and there's even room for A MUTHAFUCKIN JOJO REFERENCE!!!! The series is silly and child-like, and it brings me back to that wonderful little time in my life. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting all of this, is Non Non Biyori's absurdly gorgeous background art. From cracks and rust in buildings, to the various colors of the four seasons, to the various memorable locations throughout, Non Non Biyori's setting is filled with details that bring it to life, and its lighting, color design, and layouts are absolutely beautiful. While the actual animation can be a bit janky at times, and never really impresses, it didn't really have to for this series. For something so focused on tone and setting, the background art and color design is paramount, and this series succeeds on that front better than most. There's very little I can say to do it justice, watch the first scene of the first episode and that should do the trick. Adding equally to this immersion is the excellent OST. It's surprisingly varied, featuring an array of both beautiful, melancholic piano tracks, and child-like comedic tunes with lots of recorders, bells, and whistles. Both OP's and ED's are excellent. The OP's depict the girls playing around in the country, with a tunes by Nano.Ripe that sound comfy, \"country,\" and fun, and the visuals keep the motif of the changing seasons, with the second OP even featuring a segment where the girls march with the music as the seasons change around them. The ED's are where the series music shines most in my eyes though. A fun, catchy song with a hint of melancholy sung by the series voice actors, set to a slide-show of them having fun together. A perfect fit, and I listen to both tracks whenever I need a dose of this show. \\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is the essence of experiencing life in its purest form, sometimes literally, as the camera has a tendency to linger in the same position for long periods of time and allow things to just play out, as if it were turned on and just left on the tri-pod with no one manning it (btw, this series has some excellent direction and cinematography to boot). It makes a point to highlight all of the beautiful things that can be found all around us every day, and tells us to treasure those things, and not take them for granted. While I'm not sure if this was the intention, my interpretation of the decision to repeat the same year in Non Non Biyori Repeat is to inform us of how much we can miss; that within a single year, there is a lot that we take for granted, and we shouldn't forget about any of the wonderful moments that made that time special. If you want a light-hearted, hilarious, Slice of Life about a group of girls experiencing the milestones of growing up, with an emotional undercurrent and a few moments that will tug at the heartstrings, you really can't do much better than Non Non Biyori. Life is a beautiful thing, and this little show wrings a lot of feelings out of reminding us of that. It's a simple message, but sometimes, that can be resonant, and here, it definitely is.",

            "content": "I haven't enjoyed a slice of life anime this much since Azumanga Daioh. This is what slice of life is all about. I'm so fucking glad this thing exists. Non Non Biyori is heartwarming, funny, relaxing, and it captures the perfect feeling of beauty and nostalgia. The whole atmosphere the anime radiates is magical, and you owe it to yourself to watch it if you enjoy beauty and the simple things in life.\r\nThe anime follows Hotaru Ichijou, who has just moved from Tokyo to some isolated village in the middle of nowhere. Here she meets the other four characters that are to become the maincast, and that is where the magic begins. They all attend the same school and the same class, because there are only like five kids in the entire village (not entirely true). This already creates a cosy atmosphere, because you have a definite set of characters that you can focus on without any distractions, and they are so masterfully written that their interactions with one another becomes a pure joy to follow. Besides the main characters there are also adults that are in some way connected to them, so there are already well-established relationships and ties, but some of these you won't learn until after a few episodes. As usual with my reviews I won't go into details about the different characters, because I believe that you should experience it yourself. You will most certainly come to love them, I'll tell you that.\\n\\n\r\nAs with all Slice of Life anime, there isn't any story present. It's all about capturing mundane everyday activities in an interesting and engaging manner, and Non Non Biyori gets full scores in this regard. The characters are all very well written, and they all contribute to the overall atmosphere and feel of the show with their own spice. The anime pays an equal amount of attention to all of them, so you're not stuck with Hotaru Ichijou only if you were worried about that, which is good because I personally find her to be the least interesting character. You get to see all the aspects of the different characters' everyday life, and it really helps you connect to them. And it's so cosy! I don't think I've ever felt this cosy while watching another anime before. There is something about the beautiful music, art, and characters that just does something to me that most other anime fail to. At times I don't know whether I want to laugh along with the characters or tear up from the sheer beauty of the show, so I find myself doing both. If I could put it one way, I would say that Non Non Biyori conjures some sort of powerful nostalgia that you didn't know that you had, so you instantly feel at home whenever you follow the girls along with their shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is a wonderful show that is the embodiment of what Slice of Life is all about, so if you're looking for something fun and relaxing then I'd highly recommend it. I wholeheartely believe that this anime is a great example that anime can be taken seriously as an art form. I was almost starting to lose hope, phew. If anything, this show raised the bar too high, so now I'll have an even more difficult time finding good SoLs. Curses.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nAnime is a medium that allows us to see some crazy combinations, from legendary heroes battling over an immortal object to drills that will pierce the heavens. But other times, anime allows us to sit back, relax, and mellow out to simply enjoy the fun antics happening on-screen. In Non Non Biyori, the show does just that, leaving you with a warm feeling when all is said and done.\r\nSTORY\r\nNon Non Biyori sets itself up by introducing a new character in the beginning, her name being Hotaru. She just recently moved from the city to the country and hasjoined the other (only) four students at the school.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is a slice of life anime. As such, my small premise has little merit as to what actually goes on throughout the rest of the show. When it comes to the episodic nature of an anime like this, it isn't important to really have an over-arcing plot that drives the narrative. And NNB does a great job in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the actual episodes/arcs are fine for what they are. However, certain arcs stick out more so than others. Without spoiling too much, I'll talk about some of my favorite arcs and what they did so well.\\n\r\nThe first one to really grab my attention was the one featuring Ren and her same-aged neighbor friend. This arc really captures what the show does well, and that is showing off the characters doing everyday things. The arc featured little dialogue, not only because Ren and her friend are children (meaning they wouldn't have deep conversations with each other to begin with) but also because it is the way in which they interacted with one another that easily showed off how good of friends they truly were. It was incredibly simple yet very touching.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great arc features Hotaru, Koma, and a same-aged neighbor once again. This arc I found demonstrated the comedy of the show quite nicely. It played up Koma's insecurity about being older yet more immature than her friends. It's combination of reaction faces, dead-pan humor, and adult-oriented jokes made me really enjoy this arc fully.\\n\\n\r\nLast one, and perhaps everyone's favorite, is the small story featuring Ren and \"Candy Store\". This one was very sweet and made you feel extremely happy when watching it. It gave off this mother-daughter vibe between the two that I found to be so lovable. They did a nice job of making you see just how much those two care about one another, and when the arc ended, I was definitely making an audible \"Aww!\"\\n\\n\r\nThere are more than just these three, but these are the ones that stuck out to me the most. Almost all of the arcs are at least fine in quality (whether that be comedy, \"feels\", etc.) but you will come to find that some are just better than the others.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here. In terms of actual animation, there isn't much to be had. What the show does well despite this is the art style and backdrops. NNB makes you truly feel as if the characters are residing in the countryside. There are wide shots with many trees and open fields. There is the lone car that passes by on the never-busy road. The characters also walk by many rice fields and animal farms. During the show, they sometimes allude to the fact that where they live is not the city, and the art of the show really helps to encapsulate this feeling.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the animation and art, I liked the look/design of the characters. Notably, while Hotaru and Koma are rather \"plain-Jane\" looking, Natsumi and Ren are pretty uniquely designed, at least comparatively among the other cast members.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori gives us characters that are just straight up fun.\\n\r\nProbably the best among them is Ren. I like kids a lot, so I'm a bit biased when I say I really liked her character. She's inquisitive and kind, but just smart enough to understand the many scenarios they are put in. A lot of her charm comes from the way she says certain things or how she acts like a kid her age would. She isn't one of the best child characters but she was always fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nKomari probably comes second character-wise. I think what I enjoyed most about her was again her child-like attitude and antics. Plus, her voice actress did a very good job. A lot of the time Komari is the butt-end of the jokes, whether this be about her height or her ineptitude at cooking. But overall, she shines best when interacting with her sister Natsumi and her good friend Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Hotaru, she is probably the most interesting of the bunch. Besides coming from Tokyo (in the sense a \"foreigner\"), she actually is the most mature (in terms of personality and, strangely, puberty). On top of this, she has this semi-yuri crush towards Komari that is surprisingly hilarious. She is rather plain in appearance (perhaps even generic) but she interacts well with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Natsumi. Personifying tomboys from across the globe, she revels in lame puns, messing with her sister, and just staying optimistic in all situations. I liked her and her sister's relationship; it wasn't \"I'm older than you\", it was more \"we are really good friends.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat probably best explains the character's interactions between each other. They are all really, really good friends.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the OP and ED were not too outstanding. The OP has this beginning part to the track (literally the first five seconds) that reminds me of underwater levels in video games. The ED is definitely very child-like with its singing and use of instruments, and fit nicely with the shows themes.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly found the rest of the soundtrack to be pretty good. Like the art style, it evoked feelings of the country. For many of the pieces, they would remind me of The Legend of Zelda village themes or general outdoor areas. They have a certain fantastical feel to them that I enjoyed. Furthermore, like the ED, some of them seemed like they were more \"playful\" (that is, performed with children in mind) and always put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the voice acting, I think everyone did an above average job in each of their performances. Special shout-outs to Natsumi, Ren, Hotaru, and Koma!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show definitely puts you in a good mood. It's very relaxing, with the right amount of comedy and happy feelings. It's not dramatic nor is it suspenseful. When you're watching you know you can just sit back a bit and enjoy the humorous nature of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I absolutely loved this one, but it is for sure very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, slice of life arcs with some stand-out favorites\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, country-style art is pleasing and atmospheric\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, likable and lovable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, OP and ED are average but soundtrack and VAs nailed it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, chill out and have some fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Important Note - Be sure to stick with this anime for at least 4-5 episodes before making your decision about the entire show. These 2 episodes are a bit dull and slightly boring but the rest is enchanting and remarkable. I won't say that these episodes are bad or anything but as compared to rest of show, a bit too normal. Don't immediately judge it even if you don't find it to your liking, give it a proper chance. This is surely not your ordinary moe-moe kyun show. Instead is sweet, lovable and rich.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Nyan-pasu!\" \r\n-\r\nHave you ever felt,\r\n\"Wow, this show is simply spectecular. I needmore people to watch it, need more people to discuss it with and just don't want it to ever end\"\\n\\n\r\nIf not, then look no further because \"Non non Biyori\" is there for you. This anime is the most relaxing anime, and one of the most entertaining anime I have ever watched. Life is too short and ends too abruptly, our worries and troubles affect us more than we think they are - Why don't we make the best of time while we are still alive, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nIn one word, I would describe this anime as a \"Healer\" as it heals all your anxiety and worries, and replaces those with a warm and happy feeling, the feeling we seem to have forgotten in our tiresome and repetitive daily routine of our respective lives. I am not gonna joke when I say this, the healing element in this show is exclusively high here. It show makes you laugh you laugh from the bottom of your heart. It doesn't overly MOE-tize anything, nor make everyone super-clumsy or astereotype. Shows of this kind are easy to mess up, as the girls are shown to be all about moe and their personality is completely forgotten. But worry not as this anime is nothing like that. Sure, it has cute girls doing cute things, but unlike a regular series, it knows what to do and when to do. You will be grinning and smiling at their cute actions, but this feeling is not temporary. You actually grow to love the characters, and this feeling can be felt in the finally episode especially. \\n\\n\r\nAs a reminder, I am a huge slice of life genre lover, having watched countless SOL shows, loving some particular ones more, others less. When it first started, I was heavily biased towards it. I was like,\" It has great animation, good characters but it's a very dull and a bit boring. Meh, an average SOL.. but I guess, I will stick to it\".\\n\\n\r\n As you can see, my expectations had gone low. My views didn't change until I watched the 3rd episode, where it became impressively good. . From there and onwards, it didn't look back. Few episodes more and I was a fan, waiting for this anime every week in true words. It just didn't seem like the same show anymore. I am very, very glad that I continued it, and felt a bit bad for misunderstanding it at first. It is one of those \"Hidden gems\"  which tend to be slighltly ignored, somewhat of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nInshort, \"THIS is the ride to remember.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo we have got Hotaru, a 5th grader (Yup she is, get used to it... even if some things mislead you :p) who moves on to the countryside due to her father's job transfer. At her new school, everyone is of different ages, and in different grades, ranging from 1st to 9th.  There she meets the main cast and her soon-to-be-friends - the prank lover, 7th grader Natsumi: the adorable and everyone's favorite, 1st grader Renge: and finally 'striving to be adult' 8th grader Komari. Also there is a lazy teacher who loves sleeping more than teaching. The show begins a bit awkward, you get to know the cast and become accustomed to the relaxing air this show. In the first two episodes, nothing much happens. Once you get the hang of it, it starts feeling natural. Everything just starts to flow gradually, and you feel that the show has come alive.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who like SOL genre but have grown tired of the repetitiveness, this show is highly recommended. It is different and more unique as it takes place in a countryside instead of your good ol' city adventures. Another difference which makes this show more memorable and interesting than the rest, is the difference in age. I've never seen a classroom, ranging from 1st grade - 9th grade all at the same time. At first it felt a bit strange, seeing a kid in the same classroom with some teenagers but as I watched more, it gradually grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nBeware of the yuri vibes though. Hotaru has an innocent (but lovable) on one of her senpais i.e. Komari. I am not a yuri fan, but this, I didn't mind at all. Infact, I really enjoyed it as the excitement from a sweet and pure girl like Hotaru when she gets to be around Komari, is really something to see. Even If you don't like yuri then relax, these vibes are not as strong as a proper yuri show. You can pretty much give it an okay signal as a platonic love interest, due to it being an enjoyment enhancer. I don't think that there is need for that as yuri fan or not, you will definitely enjoy it.The best thing about this show is that it doesn't try to be complex, it knows that it doesn't need to be. It is simple, sweet and lovely, just what you would expect from this genre. It has many relatable scenes, sibling quarrels are noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not extraordinary, the story is still more special than an average one due to the countryside theme so +1 for that. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is the first aspect in which the anime truly shines - Art direction is pure 24 carat gold! It fully uses the potential of the setting to it's peak. Expect some mouthwatering scenery, the detailed animatio and the beautiful countryside. The mountains, The ponds, The farms, The trees, The flowers. Everything is colorful, vibrant and simply delicious, you just want to grab your screen and eat the gorgeous animation away. I have never had the urge to watch an anime in HD as much as I did for Non non Biyori, and so I did. I watched every episode in HD and had lots of fun admiring the magnificient sight.\\n\\n\r\n More than anything, this show is consistent. The quality does not drop an inch from start to finish. You can see the passion, it's like the director didn't slouch for a second, nor was careless. The attention and effort being put into it is admirable. There are some still images too. Normally, those would turn the people off. Who wants a show with screens frozen for what-seems-like-eternity, but this shows is the proof that if used well, even still images can help portray the emotions of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nI must say I am very much impressed with the art director. If he could do this well with a small-medium budget then what would happen if it had a high budget? Just the though is endearing So kudos to the the studio for providing us with such richfullness, colorfulness and gorgeousness. 10/10, can't cut any marks from here, it is one of the strongest points of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven in sound aspect, this anime doesn't lose its shine. The sound track consists of some soothing and relaxing pieces which puts your mind to ease. The sound of cicadas, the running water, the rustling water. Ah, the feels. It takes you back to countryside and you feel like running through the lush-green grass, open your arms wide and feel the wind. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors have done their job very well. I am just in love with Renge's voice, she has a very cute and fitting voice upon listening which, you put on a smile. The way she talks is really adorable. Who can forget the trademark line of this show i.e. \"Nyanpasu!\" - She is the inventor(just shows how creative she actually is) Same goes for everyone: The mischevious voice of Natsumi really suits her image, Komari's childish voice goes well with her personality, Hotaru's voice has a certain depth to her which suits her outer mature appearance. Likewise, for everyone.The opening and ending tracks are appropriate for this show as they are relaxing to hear and not a mind stress.The endingsong starts a bit lousy, but it is done on purpose to fit the lazy theme of the show. It becomes quite catchy in the mid all the \\n\\n\r\nway to end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters huh.\\n\\n\r\nActually I wasn't accepting anything from the characters when I first started the show. I expected regular stereotypes, but man, how wrong I was. Instead, I got some lively characters who are memorable and believable. Character attachment aspect is surprisingly high and you can't help but have atleast one or two favorites. Usually, there are one or two characters whom you just don't like, but in this anime - none. The writer knows how to make his/her character interesting without overdramatizing anything, and that's what makes them great. The bonds between everyone here feels realy, sweet and enlights a warm feeling inside you. \\n\\n\r\nWe have Natsumi who is ultra-mischevious and somewhat tomboyish. She loves teasing others and having fun. Her elder sister, Komari-chan is the most often victim of her misbehaviors. She is not good at studies, doesn't mean she can'do it. She just... doesn't study. Also her mother is fearsome whenever she does something bad. Those moments are very funny and you feel like relating to her. There is always a scary mothers\\n\\n\r\nRenge-chan is the kiddo of the group, but she is no ordinary kiddo! She is inspirational, interesting and a hinted-to-be-genius. She loves to draw and is a quite talented artist . Inventing new words, and making unique jokes are her hobby. She is one of the most unique characters, not only in appearance but also in personality. There is something extraordinary about her which makes her shine.\\n\\n\r\nKomari is a height complex and is constantly striving to be mature and cool, but things just don't go well for her. She is the older sister of Natsumi, but looks younger, something which puts pouts on her mouth. But that doesn't mean she is gonna give up any sooner, she will try again and again, no matter how circumstances lead, and that's what I love how about her. She is the 'good kid' of the family and the one who doesn't want to get in other people's way. Easily scared, has flaws but who doesn't? She is cute and sweet.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is, arguably, the main character of the show. She is a bit too tall for her age and is mature - Total opposite of Komari who is clumsy and immature but this doesn't stop her from loving her kawaii senpai. She loves spending time with Komari, be it cooking, shopping, sleeping in the same bed (kotatsu to be exact) or just sitting around. What I love about her is, even if she has a unusual fondness for Komari, she doesn't ignore others. She talks with everyone and have fun with everyone, it's just that Komari holds a bit more special existence to her.\\n\\n\r\nAlso we have Kaede aka \"candy shop\" by Renge and her friends (believe me - that's how they call her) She is a very cool onee-san and shares a sweet bond with Ren which is something you got to watch. Suguru who is the emotionless and a good-at-anything kind of brother of Komari and Natsumi. He is 9th grader and the most interesting thing about him is that he doesn't speak much. love how this series becomes a \"spot the onii-san\" as he rarely appears, but when he does - be prepared as the hilarity ensues. There are some other minor characters as well, all of which are nice and interesting but sadly, don't get enough screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fun thing is that you not only laugh with your characters, but also feel angry and sad with them. It's like you can feel their emotions and feel a part of yourself inside them. It isn't an easy task to do, it takes guts and skill to be able to make the audience feel 'one' with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n\"Non non Biyori\" and \"Enjoyment\" can be described as alternatives of each other, as it doesn't have a single moment which you are not enjoying. It does everything more than good, and doesn't lose sight of its objective - Be a relaxing series.\\n\\n\r\nI laughed. I didn't cry (Why would I, when it is just so focused on making me grin like a silly kid?) I waited for it every week, and when it ended, I missed it continuously for atleast a week. I still do... When it first started, I had high expectations but I had reduced them after watching the first episode. As it went on and on and as I got immersed into the series, it grew on me to the point that I began to count days for it's next episode. It has the 'X' factor to it which makes it one of the most memorable series of the year. It is a hope that there are still good, honest shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show and be relax, and relaxed and relaxed. It is a powerful spell which heals everything like one of those cure spell in rpg games. It will soothe your mind, and calm you down even when you are having some major worries going on. Another plus point is that it is highly rewatchable with some excellent quality art, delightful characters and gentle music. I highly recommend it to those who are too tired of the real life and need a break. This will be your breaking point, and a point to reminisce.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's \"Nyanpasu-ing desu\" (bad pun)",

            "content": "I honestly feel quite bad that I'm giving this such a low rating compared to everyone else. But oh man... I had to finish this anime on double speed just so I can finish it... \r\nI am not a huge fan of slice of life, but I don't hate it either. And since Renge is such a meme on the interwebs, I decided to watch it... But oh my goodness. Definitely not MY cup of tea.\r\n(Since this is a slice of life and there practically is no plot, I'll just decide to give 5/10.) I thought the  art was quite nice. The scenery waspeaceful, the characters were quite cute, no doubt about that. The sound was... Alright. There was nothing memorable, in my opinion anyway. But oh, the characters... The characters. The only thing that's stopping me from giving it a 1/10 is Hotarun and Suguru, and I'll explain why. \\n\\n\r\nThis is just my personal opinion, but I personally detest characters who act/are way stupider than their age. And I know anime is never realistic, but this was just WAY too much. Maybe it's because the characters grew up on the countryside without proper education, but honestly... Really? The idiocy of the characters weren't cute to me at all, it just pissed me off. (It makes sense that my favorite loli character is Shiro from NGNL, who I believe is around the same age as Komari.) I really should have just dropped it at the first couple of episodes, but the reason I stuck with it was the older brother. He was literally my favorite character even though he didn't speak a word. And at least, Hotarun was bearable... Although she was also way too mature for her age (physically and psychologically), it was better than having such stupid characters trying to go through their daily life. I felt my brain cells dying one by one as I was trying to watch this normally, and soon I was watching it at 4 times the original speed.\\n\\n\r\n Although the characters' designs were cute, I felt like I was watching a kids' show. Renge is still a good meme, but this anime personally didn't fit my taste. However feel free to watch it if you're a huge slice of life fan.",

            "content": "This show, all by itself, easily, definitively, and singlehandedly defines the entire purpose, appeal, and point of an entire genre of anime... or at least a good subset of it.\r\nTo me, there are four main subsets to slice-of-life (which I totally didn't steal from Subsonic Sparkle): gag-driven, character-driven, moe, and pure iyashikei. This show fits very well in the gag-driven category with its abundant (and incredible) use of humour. It does have aspects of the other three subsets, but don't expect the show to share the same mood or style as shows of the other categories tend to have. There are definitely moments when thecharacters absolutely shine, but, unlike many other great character-driven shows (such as Hidamari Sketch), those moments tend to be fewer and farther from each other and the characters lack that certain depth good character-driven shows have. There are cute girls however there's not really many other cute things in the show unlike other top-tier moe slice-of-lifes where every single aspect of the show is specifically designed to be cute (like GochiUsa). It's much closer to pure iyashikei, with a surprisingly larger focus on calmness and peace than most other gag-driven slice-of-lifes, than to the other two categories however, it's still not quite there. Many others would classify this as an iyashikei type of show, but, to me, pure iyashikei has this special relaxing, calm, and beautiful tone that can only be described as contemplative or meditative or even philosophical. The show could have that and many times it does (the first two and a half minutes of the show is literally just background art with the show's wonderfully great main theme being played), however, due to its more plentiful comedy and often immature characters which can not at all be considered or described reflective or pensive. This show is indeed a slice-of-life and it is one of THE slice-of-lifes out there, however I seriously hope to clearly establish that this show is not the same as many other slice-of-life shows from different subsets of the genre. Simply put, it is a gag-driven slice-of-life and it holds this identity with all its heart and soul. It is not anything else. Don't expect anything GochiUsa-like, Hidamari Sketch-like, or Amanchu-like anywhere near this show.\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I've already explicitly stated that this show doesn't have very deeply written characters, I might as well discuss that now.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does not have the most deeply written characters. They're all extremely likable and, at some points, surprisingly relatable, however, if you're looking for anyone who you can have the deepest of connections with or anyone who could interest you beyond a good injection of comedy or the occasional relatability or anyone whose character can be analyzed more than two or three layers deep or anyone with motivations any more complicated than the shallow desires of grade schoolers and lazy twenty-somethings (eat, sleep, sleep more) or anybody that has any qualities or facets other than the few they all center themselves upon (although they build upon those characteristics pretty well especially for the sake of comedy) or anyone who has thoughts, emotions, and feelings other than about anything that has just happened, is happening, or will happen within an immediate timeframe then you are out of luck with this show. The characters are all painted very well with an exorbitant amount of likability and a touch of relatability however, if you take a look at them with a fine-toothed comb, you'll discover that the characters this show has are all relatively cardboard when compared to other slice-of-lifes. (Although the fact that you still have to look at them closer to notice this is indeed a plus).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you expect any sort of development in this show of any sort revolving around the characters, any character development or relationship development or something, there is little. There is some character development within each episodic story arc, however these small character changes are designed to be so minimal that they won't be too noticed or are able to be easily forgotten without much sacrifice to the show's integrity because the show, I choose to believe, follows the old classic television rule of status quo continuity which was established so that anyone can just jump in into any episode in any order just by flipping through the channels without being alienated.\\n\\n\r\nThis show, as I said earlier, doesn't have the most deeply-written characters and I believe I've summed up why earlier (and all in a single sentence too). Nevertheless, I do indeed think it irresponsible of me to make these judgements without citing a good and proper supporting example.\\n\\n\r\nLet me take our main(-est) protagonist here, Hotaru Ichijou, as our wonderful wonderful subject for today. She's a very kind girl who looks mature, already very much like a teenager, however as a matter of fact is only in fifth grade and thinks and acts like a fifth grader. She's very self-conscious, soft-spoken, shy (although all in a very lovable way), but excessively panicky, obsessive, and enthusiastic whenever she's doing something related to her crush on her senpai, Komari Koshigaya (who is also a girl making Hotaru a lesbian; this fact is never mentioned or commented on outright by the show which I'm sure will pleasantly surprise some people and annoy some others) which is her entire comedic point. She also really enjoys the countryside a fair bit more than the city even if she expected to feel alienated, and she wishes that she can spend the rest of her life there together with her friends. Aaaaaannd... that's it. That's her entire character and is the furthest a reasonable person (or at least I) can analyze about her. There are some other small details such as her skills with cooking and knitting, and these small details do add nuance and weight towards each character, however they're very minimal and trivial when it comes down to it, telling us nothing about Hotaru we don't already know about or expect from her. At this point, I'm inclined to admit that I am kind of underselling her character a bit. There are probably a few more characteristics, details, motivations, or character I missed or merely brushed upon and many of the traits and motivations I have stated are indeed built upon to an extent. However this should give you of the basic idea for what not to expect from this show's characters. This show does not have the complex thoughts and emotions Yuno from Hidamari Sketch has, nor are there any of the strong and powerfully-developed relationships such as Cocoa and Chino's in GochiUsa, nor does it have the great but subtle character development of the soldiers in Sora no Woto. To put it simply, don't watch this show for deeply-written characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now you may ask: What exactly makes this show so 'genre-defining' when it doesn't even have properly written characters?\\n\\n\r\nTo which I shall answer: I never said they weren't well-written. I said they weren't very deeply-written. You see, I defined the four main subsets of slice-of-life earlier because shows from each subset have very key differences in their requirements for their characters. Non Non Biyori is not a character-driven slice-of-life (in the context of the four subsets), but a gag-driven slice-of-life with a hint of iyashikei, and, in this context, this show knows exactly how to use the characters it has given life.\\n\\n\r\nI have three conditions for a well-written character: likability, relatability, and nuance. If a character manages to achieve at least one of these conditions, then I would consider them well-written. (Although this also depends on the context of the character and what their role is in the story, e.g. if a character is ONLY likable in a show in the psychological genre). Let's get back to what I was talking about earlier. I said that Non Non Biyori's characters, the show's body and soul, lacked depth. They lacked layers. They were rather two-dimensional and uninteresting in terms of character analysis. They lacked nuance. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I also stated that these characters are all extremely likable. They manage to charm you very very well and very very quickly. Every character has this sort of aura written into them that is expressed wonderfully well through every action they take (props to the animators) to every interaction they make with others. They don't need depth when they have charisma. To me, a well-written character has to make viewers care about them. They hook you in and form emotional connections with you. When a nuanced character captures your interest while a relatable character reels up a viewer's old experiences, a likable character catches you with his charm and wit. And boy. These characters do have charm and wit. Believe me. They're the most charming little buggers I've seen in a long goddamn while.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's analyze why they're so likable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with character design. They're your basic moe fanfare. Even if I don't think there's anything different about the way they're drawn (except Renge-chan) compared to other moe anime, it's hard to deny that they're all pretty cute and work well as cute characters in a slice-of-life comedy. Meaning: straight away from the looks, they've got charm. Renge-chan is a good example of this. We've got her entire personality onto those flat-topped eyes of hers, expressing a sort of sleepy curiosity which falsely creates an image of sarcastic boredom until you look closer and see that these static-looking eyes portray more naive enthusiasm than any other lesser moe five year old preschooler can dream to have. Immediately, you can tell all this. There's a lot to be gained from good character design that many people do not realize. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the next logical step from here would be character acting, as in, how the character expresses their emotions through the animation. And I'd have to say, it's pretty top-notch. All the facial expressions are diverse enough for each of them to be able to stand out and, when combined with their character designs, portray just the right amount of emotion for the job, from the faces the characters make whenever a gag hits to the rich subtlety of their countenances during the show's rich character moments. They're all very expressive and, although most won't notice it, they actually contribute a large majority towards the likability and charisma of the characters. Compared to other shows, I don't think it's any more diverse than what other shows have in their facial department, but I noticed that this show manages to capture just as much emotion without reaching to the exaggerated heights other shows do. There is much exaggeration at times however it exaggerates in a scarcer and more tasteful way than most shows do. A great example again here would be Renge-chan. Those triangular mouth and flat-topped eyes may seem like an expression limiter, however they actually end up boosting the emotion she expresses. She's actually the single character in the show who can express not the most emotion but the most realistic amount of emotion in the show condensed in a single moment. There's this bit in episode four. I won't spoil it because it's absolutely beautiful. I'll just say that Renge-chan expresses an emotion that is so unbelievably realistically raw all through the power of facial expression (and top-notch voice acting). It's not at all exaggerated. It's just so real. It fits so perfectly with Renge-chan as a preschooler, too young to hold back tears well but already too old to cry excessively. It's beautiful. And there's none of that typical anime exaggeration involved. They just managed to make it so realistic. (Episode four was a great episode by the way.) And this is coming from someone who absolutely hates those short, emotional, appeal-to-pathos videos.\\n\\n\r\nNow, those were just the visual aspects of a character, the components dominated by the animator instead of the writer. They're not the most important parts of a character and won't make or break a character in any way, however they contribute a surprising amount more in character building than most people realize. But enough of that. The animator may hold importance, but the writer still holds supreme. What, in the script, makes them so likable?\\n\\n\r\nLet me just bring up an example here. There's this moment in episode seven when Hotaru and Renge are trapped in a rabbit pen. I won't tell you why they were stuck in there because I don't want to spoil too much, however they get stuck in there with nobody knowing their whereabouts to be able to check on them. There's this moment of silence, both in much shock, then Hotaru just freaks out. She starts crying about not being able to go home tonight and get to taste her mom's stew which she was promised they were going to eat tonight. She then starts screaming the word 'stew' repeatedly (in a Japanese accent too) as her face floods with tears. I love this moment. I've already repeatedly watched it several times just for the fun of the whole thing. I eventually did stop laughing, but I still have this wide permanent smile on my cheeks that seem to never come off. It really is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes me wonder here. Why do I love this moment so much? Well, as I've stated before, the character acting was pretty awesome. Hotaru's face the entire time was a masterpiece worthy of praise and, without it, the moment may have not worked at all. There was also great comedic timing. The entire gag wasn't structured according to the timing I expected, but it landed just as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think the real reason I loved this moment so much was because it just fit so well with Hotaru's character. This moment was just so Hotaru. You'd expect this kind of panicky childish desperation from her at that given moment even when it catches you off-guard. It's just like one of those moments when you hear about what one of your friends did and you just think about how that's just SO him. Hotaru as a character had already been really well-characterized from the start as the kind of character who'd do such a thing like that. We got to know her. It's not just enough for a character to have no hateable characteristics (although that's still very key to having likeable characters). We need to get to know who these characters really are to the fullest. This show has some very strong character introduction. We get to know these characters the minute we get to see them. Of course, we don't literally get to know everything about these characters. There are still many things about the characters that are added on gradually throughout the series. However, we do get a very good idea about what these characters are straight away. I mean, look at how Renge-chan's introduced. The first character in the show, she's introduced walking on her own playing a recorder fairly badly (however somehow not missing any notes) and the first thing she says is \"Are we really in the country?\" very innocently as she looks at a cow. This practically tells us everything we need to know about the character and opens with a gag immediately. The fact that the characters are very simple actually helps out with this too. They're very easy to sum up in even a matter of seconds. Of course, this does not mean that complex multifaceted characters can't have strong character introductions too. Simplicity just helps a bit. Nevertheless, all of this is foreshadowed by the fact that they simply have very likable characteristics. All of them have positive and negative traits that allow us to love them so well. They all have some positive traits we can admire of them and negative traits that we can relate with. They just have lovable traits that are all both engaging and very good at sparking comedy. It's really that simple.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's my opinion on the characters, and now, I think the next logical step would be towards how this show uses these characters to create or convey a message or tone. Why exactly is it so genre-defining?\\n\\n\r\nNow, first of all, I just want you all to know that I am not at all an expert at comedy. I can analyze (and overanalyze) any narrative work just fine, but if I were ever to dissect a joke into its constituents, it would just end up an off-putting mess. I'm sure if I think about it hard enough, maybe I'd get even a semblance of an idea of how this show's comedy works so well, but I don't want to spend years writing this article. Sure, this is most definitely intellectual laziness, this I will admit, but I do want to finish this review before dinner. For now, I can only tell you this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny. It's really funny. It takes the anime comedic style, refines it, and gives it the right characters for the job, all while sprinkling a bit of the precious iyashikei nostalgia that outright defines it. It's not too unique from other slice-of-life shows however it manages to stand on its own. There wasn't any time where I thought that one of the jokes didn't land. Maybe I'm just easy to please when it comes to comedy, but I found this show much more consistently funny than most other shows are. KonoSuba and Sakamoto desu ga? had moments that made me laugh really hard, much harder than with Non Non Biyori, however they had many misses too. Not all their jokes managed to land and they weren't that funny almost half the time. Non Non Biyori has a more stable sort of comedy. It doesn't reach the comedic heights other comedies do, but it is more consistent in their comedy than most other comedies do.\\n\\n\r\nSo after all this, why is the show so genre-defining? Simple. It's consistently funny with incredibly likable characters. It's a good benchmark for the kind of show it is. What this show is is the very definition of what the gag-driven slice-of-life is. There are many shows of the same kind that fail because of a lack of a lovable cast or simply not being funny. This show stands out not because of how different it is from other shows but how well it defines the genre it is in.\\n\\n\r\n(I wonder why I had to spend three thousand words just to establish that.)\\n\\n\r\nWell, now that I've established all that, let me get to some other miscellaneous points before I end here.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art is great. Props to whoever made them. The CGI vehicles though? Not so much. Luckily, all the CGI is placed out-of-view so they don't bother the viewer. All the other artwork? Eh. It's fine. Typical of Silver Link to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a music expert as much as I am a comedy expert. I can't describe music at all. However, I do at least know what I feel about them. I do love the main theme of this show. Hidamari Michi is a wonder to behold. It actually got popular enough to be used by a Dark Souls video. The rest of the soundtrack not derivative of the main theme are pretty good too. They've all got this laidback fun vibe. One of them is just Row Row Row Your Boat but made incredibly more relaxing. It's almost at par with Hidamari Sketch's relaxed circus jazz (as I said, can't describe music at all). The opening theme though doesn't strike me as well though. Although it's not a typical anime opening theme, it's a typical J-Pop song that doesn't really have anything special to it. However, the ending theme was pretty goddamn amazing. I love it.  It's so unique with all the bells and moe. I love it.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I enjoyed this show. Sure, its characters weren't that deeply-written, but what does that matter when all the show wants to do is make you feel good? Its characters are incredibly likable and the show is incredibly funny. While I do still think the show would've vastly improved if the characters had a touch more depth to them, I still believe this show's still a great gag-driven comedy and it really does make you feel good in the end. The music's also very memorable and so is the background art. Overall, I'd rate it eight over ten, just above K-On! but still quite a bit away from Hidamari Sketch's first season.",

Just following a group of girls going to school, as well as out of school activites. But it's more than that. The writers on this show are really something else. They are very funny, without clearly making jokes. Whether it's Renge shouting \"Jumbo!\" as a big dragonfly flies overhead, or Komari having a crisis over how short she is, there is something special about how the characters express themselves, that feels so genuine, you can'thelp but get lost in their small, cloistered world.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sit back and enjoy kinda show.

Surely the 2013 anime of studio Silver Link, Non non Biyori, would come out on the very top.\r\nSo you are tired after a long day working/studying? You feel bad after watching a top drama or you get a headache after watching mindfucking show? Just watch Non non biyori, its the chicken soup for the soul. It will warm your heart and cure your soul.\r\nThe story takes place in the countryside village of Asahigaoka, a place lacking the many of the conveniences that people from the city are accustomed to. The neareststores are miles away and the school consists of only five students, each of whom is in a different grade of elementary or middle school. Hotaru Ichijo, a fifth grader from Tokyo, transfers into Asahigaoka Branch School and has to adjust to countryside life with her new friends.\\n\\n\r\nIf i were a child again, i would want the exact same life in this anime. It is restful, joyful and vital. Every characters are so nice but everyone has their own problems and that make it close to realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link has done a wonderful job to the animation of this show. Everything is bright, colorful. It's like a lifeful painting. The characters are well drawn, detailed. The soundtrack are simply amazing. It fit the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nFor slice of life fan, this one has my highest recommendation. A show that cant be passed.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is a panacea of the heart and mind.\r\nLife too stressful? Worried or anxious about something? Just sit down in front of the screen and put this anime on, and all your concerns will dissolve away - probably within seconds. Everything - setting, plot, sound, music, art, humour - all of it is perfectly crafted at maximising this effect. And what an effect it is.\r\nThe story itself is a simple one. It follows the daily lives of four girls of various ages who all live in the same rural village and are in the same class at school. Almost everything that happens is followingtheir daily lives, with events that are both realistic and completely believable. As far as overarching story goes, that's about it - this isn't an anime you should be watching if you only care for a tense plot full of twists and turns. It is predominantly episodic in nature, although characters and settings are gradually built up over time so there's no lack of progress. Each episode contains one or two stories, every single one of which is a joy to watch and will melt your heart. The humour is lighthearted in tone, and is aimed at adding to this heart-melting effect, rather than at making you laugh out loud, although there are a few moments that could do this as well. There are also a few moments that will invoke other emotions, all very effectively and very naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is focused mainly on the four girls. Komari is the eldest of the four, although you wouldn't know it by looking. She is very self conscious of the fact that she is unusually small for her age and tries to make up for this by attempting (and largely failing) to act grown up. Hotaru, on the other hand, is unusually mature, at least on a physical level, for a fifth grader. She also quickly develops a crush on her cute chibi senpai, although none of the others ever seem to realise it. Natsumi is Komari's younger sister, and is a bit of a layabout. She's too lazy to work hard at anything and is always getting in trouble for one thing or another. And then there's Renge, called \"Ren-chon\" by Natsumi. I could honestly wax lyrical about Ren-chon all day, but I don't want to bore you any more than I already am, so I'll just say that she's the youngest of the cast, who knows a lot about things that you wouldn't expect a first grade student to know, but otherwise acts fairly normally for her age. Oh, she also has some brilliant facial expressions, and Koiwai Kotori's voice acting of her character is a definite candidate for being the best I've ever come across.\\n\r\nEvery member of the supporting cast, just like the main characters, each have their own distinctive but realistic and believable personalities, and are every bit as likeable as the central four cast members.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour and characters may be brilliant, but what makes this series really stand out is the music and images. As someone who tends to focus very heavily on the characters of a series, I don't usually care much for these things - as long as they add to the immersement, enjoyment and feel of a series, just about anything's fine by me. But here even I can't help but be overwhelmed. The series starts with nothing but pictures, sound effects and music building up the scene and setting with pure imagery. It's almost 2.5 minutes before anything is actually said, yet by that time you will likely have already entered into a state of total bliss from the gorgeous artwork, more reminiscent of a high budget film or even something you might see in an art gallery than a TV series, and soothing background music and sound effects of what is being shown. And, while the effect may not be as intense in later scenes, the quality does not drop. Just about every background in this entire series is a work of art both literally and figuratively.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the first episode over and over again and every time the effect is the same. The entire anime is thoroughly rewatchable, and every episode provides the perfect relaxation whether on your first watch or your tenth. Even brilliantly written series that depend on plot twists and reveals often grow dull when watching through for the third time, but that is of no concern for an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of slower paced anime, however, require you to be in the right mood before watching them, but again that is of no concern here, as Non Non Biyori will put you in that right mood, no matter what your previous state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a series to be watched, loved and enjoyed over and over again. Everything is perfectly toned to add to this viewing pleasure as much as possible, and it is indeed a pure pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know what nirvana feels like, watch this anime.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I'll try my best to follow the guidelines.\r\nAh. Non Non Biyori.\r\nTo be honest, when I first saw the concept art and previews, I was not impressed. Frankly, I dismissed it as yet another slice of life show, a genre so regularly plagiarized that one can't help but wonder if the anime studios are running out of ideas, as each subsequent series seems to be a cut and paste of an earlier show. It was only with great encouragement from Youtube pianist Tehishter that I began watching the show with the lowest of expectations. I was pleasantly surprised at howwrong I was.\\n\\n\r\n=Story 8/10=\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. Hotarun, a Tokyo-bred city girl, finds herself moving out of the hustle and bustle of a metropolitan life and into the middle of the countryside thanks to her father's job transfer. There, she enrolls into a school that has only 1 teacher and 5 students of varying grades. Gradually, she grows accustomed to the joys of friendship and a peaceful lifestyle. That is pretty much it, story wise. Arguably, that is all it needs to be. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this might not sound like much, the writers did a fantastic job of painting a picturesque scene, albeit rather romanticized, of the differences between living in the countryside and living in the city. To roughly quote Ren-chon, \"Don't you own a mountain in the city, Hotarun?\". There is an interesting element of comedic relief to the show as well, which does a good job of creating a light hearted and heart-warming experience altogether. It is exactly because of the lack of intricacies and complications that make this anime such a joy to watch. :)\\n\\n\r\n=Art 9/10=\\n\r\nBeing a show that revolves around country lifestyle, the show does a superb job of vividly painting the landscapes and creating a nice environment that truly sucks the viewer in. I was rather absorbed into the many beautifully done landscapes and views. The show, indeed, was full of screenshot worthy moments. The characters are nicely done as well. I for one, was pleasantly surprised at the lack of fan-service and the way the creators managed to maintain a very innocent image of the characters. \\n\\n\r\n=Sound 9/10= \\n\r\nAh. The soundtrack. I often see reviewers claim that a soundtrack is plain, boring or not memorable. I would argue otherwise. The sole purpose of a soundtrack is to immerse the viewer into the atmosphere of the show, to deliberate the mood and 'flow' of the show. In this regard, the Non Non Biyori soundtrack does its job wonderfully. The subtle hints and ambient sounds that are played fit very well into the show. It suits the laidback and heartwarming theme of the show very well. As for the OP, it introduces the playful and childish mood of the overall show, which nano.ripe performs superbly. The ED is just adorable.\\n\\n\r\n=Character 7/10=\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are decent. I liked that the show did not introduce any stereotypes or overdo any of the characters. There's Hotaru, the classy but sweet city girl, the sisters Komari and Natsumi, and Renge, who make up the main cast of the show. They each have their varying quirks and personalities, all of which are interesting in their own ways. There is, surprisingly enough, some decent and well thought out character development, in particular, the relationship between 'sweet shop lady' and Renge. I have personally lost count at how many times I've let out an audible aww throughout this series. \\n\\n\r\n=Enjoyment 10/10=\\n\r\nI love this show. No words can convey how I feel about this show, to be honest, but I'll try. Every week for the past 7 weeks, I looked forward to the airing of Non Non Biyori. Although I only got into the show halfway through the season, I was instantly hooked. I really enjoyed the laidback and calming experience that is Non Non Biyori. No matter how crappy or pissed off I felt at the time, I couldn't help but smile like an idiot after the show. Unlike other slice of life animes, Non Non Biyori is different in the sense that one truly feels at peace while watching the show. There is no drama or climax, no ante or distress. Watching the show was for me, pure bliss. 23 minutes of smiling like an idiot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime does what it set out to do perfectly. Granted, some might not enjoy the lack of action or fan service, but let me say this. Give the show a try. If you've had a crappy day at school, a disastrous meeting at work or if you just wanted to relax for a bit, watch this show. It's not the best show of the year, or even of the season, but it is special in its own right. \\n\\n\r\n9/10. \\n",

            "content": "Yes, I have a sweet spot for slice of life anime. I genuinely enjoyed the laid-back shows such as GJ-bu, Tamayura, Yuyushiki etcetera this year, but that doesn't stop me from saying that Non Non Biyori was one of the most conformist and loveliest experiences in the past few months. It's definitely great-tier in the slice of life section. \r\nThe simplistic story takes place in a rural area of the countryside. Eleven year old Hotaru Ichijou moves into the town from Tokyo with her parents, and transfers into a school consisting of only four more students; Renge, Natsumi and Komari (yes, it's a rather smallschool). It shows the ordinary lives of these children, as well as other residents in the town throughout the seasons of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThat is quite literally it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd hence is one reason why I love this show dearly. The story knows exactly what its purpose is; relaxation and healing. The execution of the countryside is depicted very well: The writing isn't complicated in the least, rather very simplistic, but the pacing and direction takes a gentle slow approach, and especially a faithful one to its original setting (it's based on a real place after all). Everything content wise is pretty much laid back, whether it's the lack of vehicles to rivers streaming, or doors without locks to shops without its shopkeeper (you pay in the money box!). The nature environment and gentle flow keeps this show consistently soothing, and each episode has the magic to ease you from anxiety or worries.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all slice of life though, as its comedic factor takes a big role too. In its environment, it's very light-hearted comedy, carried by its characters heavily, but largely comedy based nevertheless. I'd say it's a mix between Aria's slice of life aspect and Nichijou or Azumanga's comedic aspect, although more plausible than random. But the amount of laughing fit moments are high in its otherwise slow stretched content.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori doesn't illustrate any life messages at the end of every episode, unlike Aria or Tamayura, and its story doesn't particularly end on a high note either (which is good though because second season is possible). However, a few episodes can cause need of replacement for heartstrings, as the dedicated episodes can really warm and break the heart if you're not careful (which can consist of moments we can relate to too). But generally, the story presents the interactions and lives of our cast, and to lay back, eat ice cream and relax in ease is the best way to approach a series like this.\\n\\n\r\nIn our cast we have the little grade 1, Renge, the two sisters Komari and Natsumi (grade 8 and 7) and Hotaru, grade 5. They all have pretty distinct personalities, although can be considered realistic. What makes watching them more interesting though is that they're all different ages and have different mindsets, so the interactions and chemistry between each of them together are often entertaining. Especially with Renge, because we're able to see a point of view of a child, not often expressed in anime, in which her childish mindset and logic can be quite ironic yet sweet. The characters pretty much drive the comedy factors forward, and you grow to care for them as the series gradually continues.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the lack of pandering and 'sexual' fanservice is a strong trait of this show as well. The anime makes hardly any attempt to sexualize the characters (except the beach episode (which wasn't actually typical either (yes there's a beach in the countryside, deal with it))). The prohibition of panty and focus-on-body-parts shots makes them non-existent, and helps the faithfulness of this show to keep its soothing story from being ruined. It also ranges a better audience to non-anime fans (as the Japanese countryside people apparently like this show a lot!).\\n\\n\r\nI adore the animation in this show a lot. A lot of long pauses in this show makes up various, delicious wallpapers to use; it's like an impressive painting exhibition at times, with distinct, bright colours of nature in land and sky. Rivers sometimes flow, looking beautiful with reflections and sparkles. It just seems so fun to draw and paint some spectacular scenery, and such exhibitions are a complete plus in these kinds of shows. The shadings and lightning are handled very carefully too, and are the notable strengths in the art department. And of course, the budget is pretty high but that's to be expected with a slice of life shows as they usually are (there's lots of money to spend with not many scenes).\\n\\n\r\nSound direction is done craftily great too. The soundtrack portrays a lazy yet calming mood for the show, sometimes being the center of the scene for a few times. The careful use of silence and sound effects suits the environment of the countryside, in which helps essence the lovely atmosphere this show has to offer at front. The voice actors deliver their lines well, whether it's a punchline or not. You'd probably recognize Joshiraku's Marii in this, and Renge's VA coins the child character with ace. The OP and ED are generally enjoyable to listen to as well, and not once I skipped it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Non Non Biyori is definitely one of the better shows in its respective genre. It may look appealing to moe-inducers, but its environment and atmosphere is what sets itself apart from the typical slice of life anime with girls doing nothing. Its fun characters, lack of fanservice and soothing lazy pace helps the show in becoming a decent healing anime. And girls doing nothing it is, but as long as you have the right mindset and approach towards this show then it's highly enjoyable and comforting, especially when you're feeling down the dumps or blues. It's an anime that makes you smile; one that eases your tensity.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why I love the slice of life healing genre.",

            "content": "The slice of life genre was a captivating one. Having the ability to soothe the viewer. To give them that warm feeling inside. It was beautiful. But now slice of life is filled with big eyed, blob faced, cute girls. In other words, moe. If you don't know what moe is to put it simply its cute girls who do cute things. Although cute girls doing cute things isn't necessarily bad. Most lack a good story, meaningful characters,or both. In other words anime studios are focusing too much on making the show cute rather than focusing on the quality ofthe show itself.Sadly, these kinds of anime have slowly been increasing with each coming year. But among this moe epidemic. There are a few animes that rise above this trend and become a glint of hope for this dying genre.\\n\\n\r\n    Non Non Biyori is one of these animes.\\n\\n\r\n   The story is about a school in the countryside with only four students. All from different grades ranging from first to ninth. One day a transfer student called Hotaru Ichijou from Tokyo transfers to this school because of his father's job. The anime revolves around these girls and their life in the countryside.\\n\\n\r\n    The story runs out like other schoolgirl animes. It's episodic. But what makes this anime special is that every episode is skillfully crafted with great care to soothe the viewer and give the viewer a happy grin every episode. Almost every episode is realistic so there are many episodes where the viewer can relate to the show. Ever tried to hide a bad test score from your mom? or run away from your mom only to come back later? If you have then you will feel right at home with Non Non Biyori. Every episode is a beautiful adventure in itself. From playing ball on recess to making a cultural festival for less than five people. Every episode is fun, soothing, and a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\n    One look at Non Non Biyori and you know that silver link has put a lot of money into this anime. Movements are fluid. Designs are great, but what makes the art truly stand out is the background. The countryside is animated beautifully. The backgrounds feel alive. Everything from the trees to leaves falling. Even a river flowing is made with such detail. It's like the cross between art and realism. It's absolutely breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\n   The sound is (for a lack of a better term.) Just beautiful. Nano.Ripe brings us \"A rainbow colored day\". A great opening that fits this anime perfectly. The soundtrack is also something to listen to. Every track fits every scene accurately. The piano tracks are truly something captivating, and certain instruments like the harmonica are used to give the viewer that countryside feel. The ending song doesn't have the same quality as the opening and the soundtrack but I warmed up to it after a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\n   The story, animation, and the sound in Non Non Biyori are all beautiful, but what propels Non Non Biyori to be truly special is the characters. The main cast of Non Non Biyori consists of 4 characters. Komari Koshigaya, Natsume Koshigaya, Hotaru Ichijou and Renge Miyauchi. Komari is an eighth grader who is very self conscious about her small and short body. Because fo this she tries to act grown up, usually without success. Then you have Komari's younger sister Natsume Koshigaya. A seventh grader who hates studying and likes to play. She's untidy, lazy, and her grades are terrible. She usually sees Komari as a younger sister than an older one because of her small body. Then you have Renge Chan. A talented and eccentric first grader. Although she usually acts like a typicall first grader. Ther are some parts that show off her talents and her eccentric parts. Words really can't describe her accurately. You just have to watch the anime for yourself. And last but not least you have Hotaru Ichijou. A fifth grade transfer student from Tokyo who is physically mature for her age.( Guys, you know what I mean.) She is polite and overal a nice person. But the twist is that she has a crush on Komari. Which is a basis for some of the comedy in Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\n   One very interesting thing about Non Non Biyori is how it develops its characters. Now at face value these characters may seem somewhat stereotypical. But one thing that I really have to give Non Non Biyori credit for is its focus on fleshing out the characters. In every episode. You get to know more about the characters and they feel more and more alive and real as you get to know more about them and their interests, hobbies, and points of views. Their character designs may be cute, but Non Non Biyori doesn't rely on that to make characters endearing. It relies on fleshing out the character and making them have depth. I felt like I was with them right there. It is something that many anime fail to do, and it is truly stunning.\\n\\n\r\n   Non Non Biyori is definitely a beautifully crafted piece of art that should be viewed by not just fans of slice of life but fans of anime in general. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up and experience the soothing experience known as Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\n   You know that an anime is good when every episode makes you grin uncontrollably and gives you that warm feeling inside, and Non Non Biyori does exactly that.",

            "content": "Who are we to decide that Slice of Life is a genre filled with shows that are all the same? Isn\u2019t there still a batch of examples that still have those same aspects of what makes Slice of Life and still create a fresh atmosphere and aura to its world and characters? The answer is quite simply: yes. There are still shows of this nature that do provide more than just cute girls doing cute things, though there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about it to begin with. To this, Non Non Biyori is one such show that fits the category perfectly as an instant slice oflife classic.\\n\\n\r\nOne phrase that perfectly summarizes the show as whole would be, a breath of fresh air. I mean that literally too. If there is one thing that does distinguish Non Non Biyori from most shows like it is the blissful atmosphere that engulfs the world of the show. From its character interactions being so grounded in real-life, down-to-earth manner that actually makes it more memorable and so real to the environment to the subtle hints of its artistry to the backgrounds and characters.  With the plot detailing the issues of differentiating what city life is like than the rural countryside areas of society, it doesn\u2019t necessarily paint a perfect demonstrated structure of how the plot goes. But if you look at it further down the road, that really isn\u2019t very necessary for this show. It just lets the plot speak for itself through normal day dialogue rather than pointless exposition to explain anything since there\u2019s hardly anything to explain in the first place. Sure, that might capsulize the slice of life genre as a whole, but Non Non Biyori is probably one of the few that does it better than the vast majority of them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little plot that Non Non Biyori showcases makes up for the supreme colorful cast of characters that make the show worthwhile to watch all the way through. Every single girl has their own unique personality that distinguishes them from the rest in terms of how the writers build up to how their sense of humor is like in the comedy. They aren\u2019t just this mesh of girls that have personality A, B, or C, the difference of personality constructs them up to actually feeling like real human beings that anybody can relate to whether it be from their own disposition or their typical actions. Renge, for instance, is the youngest of the bunch and you\u2019d think that they\u2019d make her into this really young girl who acts older than her original age but it is, in fact, quite the opposite to this general aspect; at least in most cases to be specific. Her kindergarten mind ranges from being cute and curious that, in some cases, can be construed to how come kids at her age act in a civil manner.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding on my point about the artistry, the art is actually pretty breathtaking to look at considering how minimal the scope is to the show. It actually enhances the atmosphere greatly in its relaxed tone and inflection from how the characters look so crisp and clear from the actual colors and designs of them. The backgrounds especially give a wide range of detail into perfecting this countryside town in giving its structure more creativity and care to designing how the characters live through their day-to-day lives.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s quite unique about the comedy itself is how the timing is so minimal and slow that quickly makes the scenes more memorable just from the silence and pauses that lasts up to even about ten seconds. Again, the atmospheres helps to the show\u2019s credit with this in that the environment is so chill and down-to-earth that the jokes fit the show perfectly, even with its mild attempts at trying to be wacky in typical moe comedy fashion. That at least is always welcomed, thanks to the hilarious antics of Renge and Natsumi, who\u2019s air-headed ways always tickles the moe-bone whenever her actions are on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nCasting couldn\u2019t have been better to give these characters the voices that fits them very well to their archetypes. Highlights include Kana Asumi with her very distinct, sarcastic voice that matches very well to Komari\u2019s senpai attitude that all the other girls look up to her. Ayane Sakura has definitely made a name for herself in the seiyuu community by gracing her beautiful voice on the spotlight and she has done it once again with Natsumi, a role that was begging to be played by her; though it would be interesting to hear someone like Yui Ogura to play her as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, Non Non Biyori might be a big surprise for anyone who might be getting a little tired of the Slice of Life genre dominating the majority of the seasons lately. I myself am one of these people, though I don\u2019t necessarily have any contempt or hatred to all of the shows like this, but Non Non Biyori is a clear sign that the genre definitely has a lot of things going for it and reminds us why it\u2019s still considered a popular genre for so many people. One thing that the show does do amazingly right in slice of life, is perfectly capturing what it was like to be middle school aged kid. In that it does want us to remember what it was like being at that age filled with mystery and friends, or lack thereof. Most slice of life fail to capture this essence but we finally have one, and its name is Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Anime can fulfil many roles and act as many outlets for people. Non Non Biyori, simply put, is an experience that plays on the sweeter side of us all. For someone looking for a soothing, relaxing, cute and humorous adventure, there's a lot to get out of Non Non Biyori. Lovers of the moe slice of life genre will find something to love in this anime for sure. \r\nStory: (7/10; Not important): The thing about Non Non Biyori and many other slice of life that come in this style is that there is no real deep plot line filled with twists and turns. The free-flowingnature of the anime accentuates the calm and easy-going mood of the characters as living in the country-side. For a brief summary, Tokyo student Hotaru suddenly moves to the country side, and finds herself in a situation where she must adapt to life in the country side, where there's one candy shop, the supermarket has no cashiers and the classes are all mixed into one. The beauty of the story shines in the fact that it gives the anime lots of room to work, and a lot of situations are covered, allowing for the characters to fully shine and do what moe slice of life should do, be funny, be relaxing and bring into the world that's different than yours. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10): The art in the anime is beautiful. The country side is depicted very well, with a hefty amount of colors drawing from light color palettes. The art helps to enhance the mood as the backgrounds are intricate and the characters all have distinguishing details about them. Non Non Biyori shows the great potential of Slice of Life art in a heavy nature setting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10): The setting of Non Non Biyori also plays heavily into the sound portion of things. You will commonly and frequently hear birds chirping in the morning and the sound of flowing water in streams and ponds. Along with that the soothing soundtrack filled with woodwind and acoustic guitar pieces will certainly only add to the experience. The music never really seems out of place in Non Non Biyori and it really helps to bring out the setting as well as define the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10): What makes or breaks a slice of life anime is usually the characters. If the characters are interesting, then the SoL probably won't be interesting. Luckily for us, Non Non Biyori has four very good characters. Each one of the characters has a unique personality, whether it be Hotaru's polite manner with an obsession over her senpai, or Renge with her fun-loving and care-free personality. You will quickly love all the characters, and find favorites among them, and they all have their moments which is something that Slice of Life animes in general should strive to do. They really shine in their interactions with each other and the way they tackle certain situations in a setting that should be pretty unfamiliar to most of us. The characters are light-hearted and happy, and are memorable until the end, offering a great experience for viewers. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10): Even without a compelling and gripping plot, Non Non Biyori captured my heart immediately, and took me into the world of the Japanese country side. The characters made me laugh and for the brief 24 minutes, separated me from the stress of the real world. If you ask me, there is nothing more that a Slice of Life anime should strive for than this. The ability to grip the viewer in lack of a major plot and distract them from the real world with a thoroughly enjoyable environment with great characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8.5/10): It was really hard for me to choose between an 8 and a 9 here, so I figured I'd take the diplomat's road and give it right in the middle. Being an overall fan of anime, no matter what the genre, I always appreciated the drawn out, epic and mysterious plots of some of the very highly rated anime on MAL. However there will always be a place for Slice of Life anime, especially moe SoL. Fit with four very adorable characters, a unique setting, and many funny and cute experiences to treasure, I feel that Non Non Biyori will stand as one of the staples of moe slice of life anime. What's not to love? If you're feeling down, or want to please your sweet tooth of anime, go ahead, give Non Non Biyori a try. Come for the premise, leave with the interactions of four great characters. \\n\\n\r\nNyanpasu~",

            "content": "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out Non Non Biyori is a cute show about cute girls doing cute things. Even from the previews, discussion, and artwork, one can tell that the show depicts a slice of a life style circling a group of friends enjoying the time of their lives. It\u2019s no surprise that they live happily without the burden of of saving the world, going through multi-love polygons, or killing titans. A life on the countryside is very relaxing and so is this series. Non Non Biyori brings you stories about a group of young girls having fun and living their livesat fullest.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is an anime series based off of manga of the same name written by Atto. Silver Link handles the production that have recently achieved attention with their works such as Watamote, Fate/Kaleid, Dusk of Maiden etc. Likewise, these all share a similar setting taken place at school. However, Non Non Biyori doesn\u2019t have the burden of living in a city where there\u2019s crime, poverty, or hate; neither in the case does it evoke shock or horror. Instead, we got pleasurable atmosphere on the countryside where everyday is a brand new adventure.\\n\\n\r\nCalling this show \u2018cute\u2019 or \u2018adorable\u2019 isn\u2019t uncommon. After all, the series gives off that sense of innocence with our schoolgirls as the main characters. The youngest one among them is Renge Miyauchi, a first grader with a rather perspective view of what\u2019s around her. She also has a catchphrase ending many of her sentences with \u201cna non\u201d, a pun to the anime title. Renge can be defined as the show\u2019s mascot as she is the youngest yet also the most eye catching character in many of the episodes. Among its other main character cast includes the shy Hotaru Ichijou, Natsumi, and Komari of the Koshigaya siblings. All of them have different personalities but shares a bonding friendship that connects them together.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori clearly lacks any directional plot but it sets up its premise well. We have Hotaru Ichijou, a shy 5th grade elementary schoolgirl who just recently moved to the countryside. Being the new kid at school isn\u2019t easy especially with a class so small that all the students share the same classroom. There isn\u2019t a big story going on but we can quickly tell that Hotaru tries to adjust to her new environment. Renge seems to be the welcoming director as she plays the role of welcoming Hotaru to the new class. It\u2019s funny to see the position set up this way because of their age difference but a show like this pokes fun at anything. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having fun in this series because its style. It portrays the its slice of life genre quite well in this way and gives an appreciation to its settings and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also likes to poke the fun of the male population since there is almost none. Well, there is one guy in the show so far that is barely acknowledged for existence. His name is Suguru Koshigaya, a third grader with little presence at all. Unlike Kuroko from a certain basketball series, no one really seems to care about him either. \\n\\n\r\nFarm life isn\u2019t always either so sometimes throughout the series, we witness the characters out on the sun doing field work. Only this time, the girls seems to be taking responsibility. Take Renge for example. She is only in the first grade but clearly demonstrates that she can be wise even at time compared to their schoolteacher. It\u2019s laughable in this way since that means the majority of this series is dominated by the main characters rather than anyone else. And that would be true too as many of the times, we see our main characters in the spotlight with minimal amount of attention to other supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has a lot of comedy whether it might be the dialogues, responses, or character interactions. This is usually caused by misunderstandings, odd events, or situations. At the same time, there is also some tension bought out occasionally by Natsume. She plays more of a superior to others (especially her sister and brother) but at the same time is noticeable for her loving bond with everyone. There are also time when she tries to teach Renge some things not to be taught to a first grader. It\u2019s amusing to watch since the parents are almost in the complete background while the kids tries to play a role in guardianship. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its cuteness, the show can be somewhat repetitive to watch. There\u2019s also a lack of exploration in any of the characters\u2019 backgrounds. It seems to clearly focus on its slice of life style while retaining its cute interpretations. While, there\u2019s minimal fan service and negates the harem trope (despite there being one main male character), there\u2019s still the typical beach episode. Additionally, most of the episodes seems to lack any purpose or moral as they are all standalone. As the show is also focused directly at the countryside, there\u2019s nearly hardly anything else new besides the farm setting that is focused on. However, there are settings such as the house where the characters live, the school (with only one classroom being the focus),  a sunny beach, and a shrine. Typical as it is, the show doesn\u2019t try out new or exciting features that sets foot outside its SOL zone.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, Silver Link did an excellent job with its production with rich visuals. The countryside is presented with a calm atmosphere that illustrates the nature of being simple. Indeed, it\u2019s nothing like the heavily populated cities where there is pollution, crime, or poverty. Instead, there\u2019s a relaxing life with our four girls. Speaking of the girls, most of them are designed with a charming presence. Their diverse colored hairs and simple clothing contrasts with the stereotypical valley girl with heavy makeup. It\u2019s beautiful in its own way and that\u2019s what important.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t very impressive but sends its message well with the calm atmosphere. Most of the time, the OST is lighthearted whether it\u2019s with character interactions, conversations, or just the girls having fun. There are a few moments when we witness some more tense moments although most of this is downplayed as comedy because the show itself is created to bring out laughter and joy. The OP song \u201cNanairo Biyori\u201d by nano. Ripo is decorated with cuteness while its ED song has an unique style where the cast members whom plays the characters in the show sings its theme. Speaking of which, I also find most of the characters\u2019 voices to match well. Rie Murakawa brings out that voice of shyness in Hotaru\u2019s character while Kotori Koiawai portrays Renge as who she exactly is. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this series is probably one of those anime that is overlooked compared to other mainstream series. Underrated wouldn\u2019t be a word I\u2019d describe Non Non Biyori. Instead, it\u2019s something that is likely slipped under people\u2019s radars. The fact that slice of life series with cute girls doing cute things has become a repetitive tropes in recent years. However, that idea can still be appreciated thanks to the characters of this series. The way they live countryside is simple and doesn\u2019t bring out a stressful way of portraying life. There is a lack of story depth but if one can overlook that will learn how to appreciate the way this series presents itself. It reaffirms the style of a slice of life anime without going over the bar. Sometimes in life, you just want to relax a bit and enjoy something simple. Luckily, there\u2019s shows like Non Non Biyori that can give just what you deserve. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Nothing can be objectively good, but enjoyment has to come from somewhere. Non Non Biyori is an anime that I really enjoyed but I don\u2019t know exactly why. I will be comparing it to other anime to see if I can figure out exactly what made it so enjoyable to me.\r\nThe story in Non Non Biyori is pretty simple: it\u2019s about a girl from Tokyo who moves to a rural part of the country, likely a hamlet. Although it\u2019s supposed to be about her getting used to her new lifestyle, this intent is lost fast and just like Akari from Yuru Yuri she eventually doesn\u2019teven seem like the protagonist anymore. It\u2019s not really a problem since in my opinion this anime works better with a group lead than a single protagonist at the head of the group, but the character introduced as the protagonist does seem to have the least characterization out of the main cast. It\u2019s a common theory that the setting is what makes it so enjoyable because it\u2019s relatable, but Tamako Market takes place in a town much more similar to my own and it wasn\u2019t anywhere near as enjoyable. I had some problems with Tamako Market since the main character was the only one with decent character development and generally not much going on, but there wasn\u2019t anything I can remember specifically about it that would make it that much worse than Non Non Biyori. The story of moving to a different place is a story that I can connect to since I once lived in Costa Rica for six months which has a very different culture and atmosphere than my own, but the exchanges in Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, Kiniro Mosaic, and Ikoku Meiro no Crois\u00e9e The Animation are much more similar to the situation I was in and I didn\u2019t enjoy any of them quite as much as Non Non Biyori. I definitely had problems with these anime as well: I didn\u2019t like the harem ending of Sakurasou, the accents in Kiniro Mosaic made the series feel fake, and Labyrinth felt more like a Japanese dub since it\u2019s set in France with French characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style could be a reason to like Non Non Biyori, after all the characters are very well designed and the background art is beautiful especially for such a long series. Starting with the character designs they all have realistic hair colours save Renge who despite having purple twintails fits in nicely with the art style. They\u2019re obviously drawn as lolis and are never sexualized. They would make better younger sisters than girlfriends. The eye size is pretty typical for a seinen moe anime and although it obviously isn\u2019t realistic it could arguably be the most attractive eye size in anime. Apart from Renge\u2019s triangle mouth their faces all look fairly similar, but their face shapes are still distinct enough that their hair isn\u2019t the only thing you can use to tell their head shots apart. The brother looks like a fairly generic anime boy and since he doesn\u2019t even have a voice actor I haven\u2019t felt any reason to remember his name. The two older characters Kaede, the candy store lady, and Kazuho, the teacher, have more unique designs than the main cast. Aside from how different the characters look from each other they all do have memorable designs even for a veteran of the moe genre such as myself. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider Non Non Biyori\u2019s designs to be my favourite designs, though. Anime adapted from video games such as Kantai Collection, Hyperdimension Neptunia, and Idolmaster have more attractive designs in my opinion. Apart from Aikatsu and Steins;Gate I can\u2019t remember any anime adapted from a video that was actually well made especially in terms of competing against Non Non Biyori. Kantai Collection dragged out and although it\u2019s lackluster storyline wasn\u2019t any worse than Non Non Biyori\u2019s absence of a solid story it still felt far less satisfying and halfway through I felt no drive to complete it. Hyperdimension Neptunia has some of the most beautiful character designs I\u2019ve seen, but the story fails to be engaging and as fun as the characters are to be with it wasn\u2019t that enjoyable of an anime. Idolmaster does have some character development and the story has some substance to it, but with 14 main characters and only 25 episodes it doesn\u2019t have enough time to give any of them that deep of characterization. Aikatsu I already consider to be better than Non Non Biyori so its strengths and weaknesses are irrelevant. Steins;Gate is adapted from a visual novel with a story that has many paths but only one of which was adapted into the anime. The story is good, the characters are designed well, and it\u2019s incredibly enjoyable, but for whatever reason I still rank it below Non Non Biyori. Steins;Gate is a very different series from Non Non Biyori, but the reasons I liked the two series still share a considerable amount of overlap. Both of the anime have likable characters and are set in a fairly small yet well developed area. Steins;Gate explores its setting by showing the characters changing the very world they live in through sending simple text messages and Non Non Biyori explores its setting by showing the characters travelling around through their little village and using different ways to indicate just how far apart different parts of their village are from each other. If the character design truly was the thing that made the anime so enjoyable then High School Fleet, the other anime Atto provided character designs for, should have been as enjoyable, but I found that anime to be quite mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art is very detailed, pretty, and shiny for an anime of its length. The three Makoko Shinkai films I\u2019ve seen, Five Centimetres Per Second, Your Name, and Garden of Words have just as beautiful of backgrounds if not more beautiful, but as movies they only have so much time to make an impact and as good as their art was the stories in them were either too complicated for their runtime or otherwise weren\u2019t quite as strong as what you would see in a series. The personalities of the characters aren\u2019t too detailed and only serve as ways to move the plot forward rather than being important contributions to the enjoyability of the anime. The three anime series I distinctly remember as having as good of background art as Non Non Biyori are Yama no Susume, Glasslip, and Anohana. I know, it\u2019s not everyday that someone would willingly compare their favourite anime to Glasslip, but I think it\u2019s for the best. The first season of Yama no Susume has good backgrounds but is too short to draw any conclusions from; the second season I consider to be better than Non Non Biyori and therefore isn\u2019t important for comparison. Glasslip is infamous for being far more uneventful than even anime like K-On! and Lucky Star. I think it would be safe to say that even if the background art was among the most important factors towards my enjoyment that all of the turn-offs in Glasslip would make it unenjoyable to even the people who valued background art the most, but there are still some people who enjoy Glasslip sincerely so it can\u2019t simply be turned down as an anime impossible to enjoy no matter what your tastes. Not only does Glasslip not have any real characterization, but the intent of it being a supernatural romance is sort of forgotten about and nothing really happens throughout the series. In addition to no value in the storytelling there also weren\u2019t any successful attempts at comedy. Anohana is a much better anime than Glasslip, but it still fails in a number of ways. The characters were interesting and well drawn, but the story of a dead friend who only the protagonist was incredibly unrealistic. My theory that Menma\u2019s spirit was actually audio-only and Jintan was simply imagining her in physical form was shattered by the end due to conflicting information. Non Non Biyori doesn\u2019t have any unexplained supernatural elements to bother me, but even anime with seemingly flawless magic systems like Death Note and Shigofumi rank lower on my list, but I won\u2019t go into explaining those.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the background art so important in Non Non Biyori is where the anime takes place. The setting is quite unique and it\u2019s the only slice of life anime I\u2019ve seen set in a such a unique place that doesn\u2019t have something to do with careers. Shirobako, Bartender, and Barakamon have similar settings, but Shirobako and Bartender are fairly slow and information heavy. Barakamon I saw right after Non Non Biyori and although there wasn\u2019t really anything wrong with it I still didn\u2019t enjoy it quite as much. As I was explaining before, Non Non Biyori does a lot with its small world. Unlike anime such as Sword Art Online and Gurren Lagann that have too big of a world to handle correctly the characters and the director do a good job at getting you to know where everything is without having to go everywhere in near-real time like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Having too small of a world can also be a problem. Seitokai no Ichizon takes place in a single room for the first few episodes and even when they do the school doesn\u2019t feel as natural or well laid out as the village in Non Non Biyori. I actually found the comedy in Seitokai no Ichizon to be comparable to if not better than the comedy in Non Non Biyori, but I still didn\u2019t think it was as good of an anime. The protagonist in Elemi is an inanimate object so naturally the movement in the anime was extremely limited no matter how good the writing was.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the places in Non Non Biyori feel like places I could really go to. The candy store not only reminds me of real candy stores that I\u2019ve been to but the aesthetic of it and the way everything is organized truly feels so well put together that even if I hadn\u2019t seen other stores like it that wouldn\u2019t make it any less believable. The bridge they jump off of feels nostalgic despite the fact that I\u2019ve only done things in real life that were remotely similar. The scene is written in a way that I could see myself in that situation just through the shared sense of that kind of childish innocence. When they go to the little hole in the wall and talk about how they had done that before when they were younger I relate to that sense of nostalgia in a way that I haven\u2019t really seen in other anime. Sure, there are some anime that I saw as a kid and are pieces of my childhood and therefore nostalgic to look back on, but I can\u2019t remember any other anime that really go into that sense of realistic nostalgia the characters have around things in their own world. Dagashi Kashi did that a bit, but the monster of the week style of it made it feel a bit too fake for it to hit me in that same way. I have very strong memories of playing with my cousin up at his dad\u2019s (or my uncle\u2019s) cabin. In the summer we played around the lake getting mucky, we went under a bridge and blew up firecrackers that we stuck to the bridge with clay, and we found tadpoles in the pond. In the winter we used the firecrackers in the snow, we went on the frozen lake on snowmobiles, and we sledded down hills on waxed cardboard. We also play games like the \u201csuicide notes\u201d game where we would jump off a loft and say why were killing ourselves and then would drink something to \u201crevive\u201d us. These years didn\u2019t just blend into one another since I would look forward to the next time I would go up there and would always go with fond memories of the previous trips. The nostalgia wasn\u2019t just additive, it was magnified through the nostalgia of nostalgia itself. The characters have cell phones and are obviously living in the modern day and age, but you can still watch the anime as if it is through the eyes of the characters looking back on their childhood.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the school uniforms and the buildings themselves are rather unique. One important thing to note is that since the school has both elementary school and middle school students they don\u2019t all wear the same uniform, in fact if weren\u2019t for the flashback that showed Kaede wearing the uniform it could have been assumed that it was just how Natsumi and Komari\u2019s parents decided to dress them. In the whole school there is only one male, but it isn\u2019t a harem and not only is he not that important of a character he doesn\u2019t have single line and is only used for comedy. With the male and female uniforms in consideration they\u2019ve both designed nicely. Renge and Hotaru don\u2019t wear the uniform but the clothing they do wear looks good. The school\u2019s design is quite interesting. It\u2019s quite small and only has a few rooms. It feels quite natural and as poorly as it is taken care of the internal structure isn\u2019t too chaotic. For a schoolgirl not too much of the anime takes place in the school. I think this works to its benefit since their lives outside of school are more interesting, but the time they\u2019re shown in school isn\u2019t wasted and their pathetic excuse for a teacher is charming in her own way.\\n\\n\r\nApart from anime based around music like So Ra No Wo To and Nerima Daikon Brothers it can be hard to know just how much the quality of the sound is affecting your enjoyment, but I feel like the voice acting and background music in this anime really did make a difference. This is an anime I think would lose a lot in an English dub if it were to ever receive one. The very first scene has Renge playing a recorder completely out of tune, which sets the tone for the series very well. Renge\u2019s \u201cnyanpasu\u201d doesn\u2019t have any nice sounding English equivalent, sort of like how off Nico\u2019s \u201cNico-Nico-Nii\u201d sounds in the English dub of Love Live. Like most moe anime the cuteness of their voices is just as important to the series as the cuteness of their character designs. Komari\u2019s slight tsundere lilt has a nice sound to it even if her personality doesn\u2019t feel super realistic. Little things like rocks being thrown and water splashing all sound realistic enough but also don\u2019t have that problem where instead of imagining the sound in their world you would be able to tell that someone had to use a microphone to create that sound effect. Renge\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t have as big of a range as the other characters, but she still expresses a lot of emotion. Chocotto Sister and Saki I also liked the voices, sound effects, and music in, but they just didn\u2019t feel like as strong of series overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat analysis would be complete with taking apart the animation of the opening theme? As much as I doubt a good OP could provide the sole enjoyment for a show especially considering how good the OPs for anime like Absolute Duo,  Lord Marksman and Vanadis, and Golden Time were compared to how little I actually enjoyed those anime, but I do believe the openings to this were really well made and at least made some contribution to my enjoyment of the anime. The OP starts off by showing the river the series is set near which gives a bit of information about the setting right off the bat since you wouldn\u2019t normally see rivers like that in the city, especially without any pollution and being surrounded by rocks rather than concrete. I know the OP doesn\u2019t actually start at the beginning of the first episode, but it still does give a good introduction to the series in addition to what we see of the anime before the OP starts. After the first shot we are shown the sky with clouds to further the idea that this is set in the semi-wilderness of a quaint hamlet. The title is shown in a colourful and bubbly font similar to the kind that an elementary school student might use to write their name. I think this might be nodding towards the fact that the main characters are younger than our typical 15-17 year olds these anime tend to revolve around. We see a can being kicked, a reference to the popular kids\u2019 game \u201ckick the can\u201d, and then shows Natsumi with a grin implying that she was the one who kicked it. The students start running and the teacher stands there dazed as if ignorant to her job as \u201cit\u201d or even to the rules of the game in general. Throughout the series the teacher is constantly shown as being less competent than the students she has been assigned to teach so her inability to suppress her apathy in order to just properly play a game with some children says a lot about her character. Considering how unathletic she has been shown to be it\u2019s surprising that the can even needed to be kicked in the first place, but she obviously didn\u2019t do a good job at protecting it. Even with their failure of a teacher playing the key role in their game, they still seem to be enjoying themselves more than any normal adult has in years. They try hard to run away as fast as they can even though \u201cit\u201d is making no effort to chase after them whatsoever. How easy it is for them to have fun really plays into the series and in a way can even metaphorically describe how I feel about the series as a whole since despite how little seems to be going on in it the anime is still extremely enjoyable. The next scene shows the students playing music, cooking, and playing all under the limited supervision of their teacher. Although the teacher has her eyes permanently closed, she is shown to be sleeping in the last of these three events by having a bubble coming out of her nose and giving her a more joyous look on her face than usual. Again, the kids seem to be enjoying these activities, but considering how poorly Renge was shown playing the recorder in the first scene it\u2019s a given that whatever skills they\u2019re meant to be learning in these situations are taught in an ineffective manner. They are then shown walking in the rain with umbrellas and next the picture changes to a puddle showing the kind of weather that they typically get in that area. They are then shown relaxing in the shade of a tree with a ball visible showing that they were playing some sort of game and got tired. We then see a train go by in the background and it is shown that Hotaru was riding it. I think this is used to show the cultural distance between her and the other characters. She looks solemnly at the scenery through the window as it passes by. Natsumi is shown sitting on a tree branch and looking out at the sunset. The next image shows Komari inside reading a book while hiding away from the rain, which is clearly a common occurrence in the place they live. Renge hangs up a teru teru bozu, a Japanese spiritual ornament intended to keep the rain away. This not only shows that she would rather it not be raining despite relying somewhat on the rain for crop growth but also that she believes this little handmade figure will actually work to make the skies clear again. Although in Japan the teru teru bozu is a well known symbol we don\u2019t see it in many anime. I\u2019m going to speculate that most teenagers in Japan don\u2019t trust this figure to help any and considering all the other Japanese cultural traditions that rely on faith that Japanese teenagers will participate in I think this specific one is likely seen as particularly childish. The four main characters are then shown lined up on a bridge and they take turns jumping into the river. Hotaru is reluctant to join at first, but she quickly gives. This scene is also shown in the series, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a spoiler simply because of the apparent storyless structure of the anime. The manga wasn\u2019t even adapted chronologically, hence the name \u201cRepeat\u201d for the sequel, and it never really needed to be since it\u2019s not important what order the events happened in. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious what this scene is meant to show. Hotaru isn\u2019t too into this idea, but she still wants to join her friends in an activity that they\u2019re all used to. The next scene shows the characters staring blankly at the camera for a couple seconds before eating what look like cookies in perfect unison. This could be to show how in sync they\u2019ve become, but even without any deeper meaning they looking really cute doing that together. Natsumi and Renge have a snowball fight. Natsumi misses her shot and Renge picks a snowball far too big for her to feasibly use as a weapon. Natsumi looks frightened, but seeing the way Renge staggers back it doesn\u2019t look like she would be able to throw it very far if at all. In the background we see Komari crying while Hotaru cleans the snow off of her that she was once covered with. We never see this full scene in the show itself, but even this little snapshot makes for an interesting tale. The concept of a girl having snow piled onto her fits in with the show so well I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was something from the manga that simply wasn\u2019t able to be adapted. We end with Natsumi jumping on large colourful tires that have been positioned to be played on. The scenes are set up in a way to show all four seasons of the year wrapped up into 90 seconds. I don\u2019t pay enough attention to opening animations to give examples of similar openings to compare this to.\\n\\n\r\nLike most slice of life anime this puts a very big importance on the characters, both how likable they are as individuals and how they interact with each other. I will be talking about the four main characters as well as the more prevalent supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is introduced to us as the main character. She\u2019s from Tokyo as are 25% of the total population of Japan and the majority of the anime studios. She lives with her parents and has a healthy family relationship, much like the rest of the characters. Although the parents aren\u2019t too important of characters, it is important to note that they\u2019re all alive and still together since a lot of anime feature main casts that don\u2019t have complete families. One of Hotaru\u2019s defining features is how mature she looks for her age. Personality wise she more closely matches her chronological age than her visual age. She has a crush on Komari even to the point of making plush dolls of her. This seems more like yuri fanservice than a legitimate attempt to give her character more depth, but even if it does break the illusion of reality it still never bothered me. In fact, I found this little bit of romance to be kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nRenge is a rather unique character. Some call her the most realistic child in anime, although she still isn\u2019t quite as believable as Rin from Usagi Drop. She is significantly younger than the rest of the main cast, but they still manage to be normal friends without seeing her as being less important. She does have certain childish needs that the others will often have to cater to. She acts like a bit of a younger sister to all of them even though the only other character related to her is their teacher. Pretty much everything she does looks so heartwarming and innocent that it\u2019s easy to ignore how weird she would look in real life. She could be referred to as a loli, but she isn\u2019t sexualized in any way. This anime is made for adult men and much unlike anime such as Ro-Kyu-Bu the characters are intended to be as innocent and realistic as would make sense for the context. Considering the fact that school swimsuits are more fetishized in Japan than bikinis it still could be considering sexual in that way, but it would still be disturbing for people to fap to it.\\n\\n\r\nKomari isn\u2019t exactly a cliche character, but she does follow a lot of tropes. She has a strong complex around being a loli and doesn\u2019t like being the older sister who looks like a little kid. Just like Ed from Fullmetal Alchemist she freaks out about her height frequently and although as a comedy anime this isn\u2019t exactly misplaced it is a pretty generic character trait. It\u2019s supposed to be funny, but since any audience member who has seen at least a handful of anime like this is already used to that joke it loses its value as a joke and just becomes an annoyance. Just like any other moe or harem anime she complains about her breast size and she is envious of Hotaru who has much larger breasts than her despite a few years younger. Unlike Lucky Star, Toradora, and Yuru Yuri that were willing to go so far to actually turn the flat chestedness of a character into an important part of the show or even a major plot point this anime just passes it off as something you should come to expect from these types of anime and doesn\u2019t do anything with it. I\u2019m not saying that Chuu Bra is a good anime because it was brave enough to make its entire plot revolve around breasts, but I think it\u2019s better if an anime actually does something with the tropes it incorporates rather than just inserting harem light novel humour into an anime where that isn\u2019t warranted. These things wouldn\u2019t be so much of a problem if she had more going on, but the fact is that her entire character is based around the standard imouto stereotypes. For whatever reason none of this bothered me all that much when I was watching the series. In retrospect I recognise that she wasn\u2019t that well written, but unlike Sword Art Online that I\u2019ve come to consider much worse upon noticing its flaws after the fact this hasn\u2019t made me feel like any of my enjoyment was any less deserved than when I watched the anime. She has yaeba and considering the fact that the town hasn\u2019t been shown to have a hospital or even a properly functional school I don\u2019t think anyone would care to \u201cfix\u201d it or even see it as a problem that needs a solution.\\n\\n\r\nNatsumi is Komari\u2019s younger sister and is the youngest child in her family. Surprisingly despite how realistic this anime is said to feel she\u2019s the only character in the main cast who doesn\u2019t just feel like some anime character. This isn\u2019t to say that she\u2019s a boring character, though. She acts exactly how you would expect a girl her age to act. You could see it as a good thing that they aren\u2019t all just normal people because it does make their characters a bit more fun even if they wouldn\u2019t fit well in reality. She takes good care of Renge and generally gets along well with the other characters. As shown in the OP she\u2019s considered to be fairly adventurous and athletic.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character I will talk about is Komari and Natsumi\u2019s brother who seems so insignificant that I can\u2019t even remember his name. Aside from Hotaru\u2019s father he\u2019s the only male character we know about in the entire town. He\u2019s quite reserved and doesn\u2019t even have a voice actor since he never speaks. He participates in activities with the other characters and in one episode he\u2019s shown to be quite dextrous. Although he\u2019s almost like a main character, because he doesn\u2019t speak or interact much with the other characters it\u2019s hard to remember much about him. He\u2019s pretty much only used comedy and any scene where he isn\u2019t just a background character he isn\u2019t exactly treated well. For an anime with a single male character surrounded by cute girls he doesn\u2019t seem too thrilled and for all we know he might be asexual. If we assume he isn\u2019t he doesn\u2019t have many options anyway. Komari and Natsumi are his sisters so they\u2019re off limits, Renge is far too young for him, and Hotaru is a lesbian. Kaede the candy lady is only six years older than him so she could be a potential partner, but I don\u2019t know how good of a couple they would make. Hotaru might be bisexual, but she seems a bit too obsessed with Komari to be interested in getting into a relationship with him. There was the vegetable stand that is put out by other people and we have seen busses with drivers that are most likely from that town so I don\u2019t think the characters we have seen are the only residents, but it isn\u2019t clear just how many other people live there or how many dating options he has if they were to keep the town going for more generations.\\n\\n\r\nKaede who is also known as \u201cthe candy store lady\u201d is a young woman who runs the local corner store that the main characters will buy candy from. She graduated from the local school and has a close connection with Renge. In addition to candy she does sell some other things in her store, but we haven\u2019t seen too much else being sold there nor have we even seen any of the adults shopping there. It was shown that she has a kitchen attached to the store and with the way it\u2019s set up you can tell that she actually does live there. She was first introduced as just some storekeeper, but she later became an important cast member and has gone on different outings with the other characters. It is unknown what other customers she has that aren\u2019t the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe school teacher is another important character. She is Renge\u2019s older sister. Being only four years older than Kaede she was likely taught at the same time but we don\u2019t know who taught the class before her. She seems like the most incompetent teacher and is often shown sleeping when she\u2019s supposed to be teaching. I\u2019m sure we all have had substitute teachers who do nothing but just give out worksheets for students to complete rather than actually teaching partly because the actual teacher isn\u2019t expecting a single day of poor teaching to be that much of a detriment, but she is the main teacher and even worksheets would do a better job than her teaching style. When you think about how dysfunctional the teacher is it\u2019s hard to overlook how the rest of the school is run. Japanese schools are cleaned by the students rather than janitors and their school doesn\u2019t seem well taken care of. The roof leaks and the floorboards can even give way. Who knows how old the school uniforms are. They don\u2019t look like they have much wear, but even though Hotaru is about the same size as the other girls she was never offered a uniform so it might be that they were all being used. There\u2019s only one male student so there might be a male uniform laying around that she could wear with her own skirt, but either no one thought of that or it might be that the only reason the ones we see don\u2019t look torn up is because they go through periodic repairs.\\n\\n\r\nAs redundant as it may seem in an piece of writing that is intended to deconstruct my enjoyment of the series there still are a few things related to enjoyment that I haven\u2019t gone into much depth yet. The humour in this anime is often cited as being one of its strengths. The raw enjoyment that comes from the situations and random jokes differs a fair and is actually a bit weaker than the comedy in Sansha Sanyou and Joshiraku. These two anime don\u2019t really have anything wrong with them that would noticeably tick me off, but I still don\u2019t consider them to be as good of anime. One thing I appreciate about Non Non Biyori is how naturally the characters grow on you. Sure, it is a common trope for a character to join a new group of people at the beginning so the introductions make sense, but unlike anime such as Code Geass and No Game No Life where even the protagonists are secretive about their true intentions the characters in this show are up front about themselves and we learn about them in a similar way to how you would learn more about your friends or coworkers in real life. I think it\u2019s really nice and relaxing to get to know unrealistic characters in such a natural way. Anime like Anne Happy and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei introduce the characters just fine, but because all of the characters represent something different they don\u2019t feel like real people. I know anime like Log Horizon have realistic characters in an unrealistic environment which is a good combination, but it doesn\u2019t feel quite as good.\\n\\n\r\nMy second point for the enjoyment section will be continuing on my comparison to Steins;Gate. Steins;Gate is well written and doesn\u2019t have that visible of flaws, but after this analysis I understand why I didn\u2019t like it as much as Non Non Biyori. The characters are well written and have interesting and realistic personalities, but the way they're used doesn\u2019t leave me with the same fuzzy feeling Non Non Biyori gives me. Two of the characters die multiple times and one of the characters even changes from male to female not through a sex operation but by artificially changing their embryo to xx after it was already fertilized, something that is only possible through flawed Japanese mythology. I know I had some negative things to say about Non Non Biyori, but for a show with a magic system so well explained it disturbs me to see things that don\u2019t work in our world and aren't explained in theirs. These specific things ticked me off in the show because of how tight the rest of the logic is. Just like the difference between cobblestone and a near-perfect sidewalk with a couple cracks the individual flaws are more noticeable and memorable in Steins;Gate than in very flawed anime like Vividred Operation, Ore, Twintail ni Narimasu., or Date a Live. The story in Steins;Gate is almost possible so the couple problems were a bit disappointing. In comparison Non Non Biyori doesn't have a story to begin with and all of its flaws fall within the realm it has set out for itself. Its simplicity is in itself a strength because it doesn't require the viewer to suspend their disbelief that much in order to get maximum enjoyment from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important reasons about why I like Non Non Biyori so much more than similar anime is the way it enabled me to connect with my past nostalgia and how well it avoids balatant mistakes as well as being able to cover up its smaller existing ones. As far from reality as the characters may be they are still super cuddly and fun to be around. They really feel like they belong in their world. Although I was skeptical at first as to why I held this anime to such a high regard I still believe it\u2019s just as good as I did when I first saw it with my brother on a plane over a year ago. I have also watched Ghost Stories (dub) with him and although I loved that anime it still wasn\u2019t quite as good so I don\u2019t think just watching it with him would be too big of an impact. The songs were great and the way they show all four seasons was a nice touch.\\n",

            "content": "When first encountered by Non Non Biyori, I instantly had the thought that something mediocre were to appear as with (obviously a biased perspective) most modern slice of life shows. Boy was I wrong though, because if you're anything like me and enjoy a good, relaxing slice of life show that makes you feel good, cosy and just want to keep watching... Well, you're in the right place.\r\nNon Non Biyori revolves around a really simple story, where we're met by Renge and her friends, and we follow them throughout their daily lives in the sticks. It really doesn't get any more complex than that, andit's one of the main reasons as to why I had such a great time watching this show. You don't have to worry about figuring some mystery out, or the story having any real plotholes for that matter. To me, a slice of life show should be as simple as possible and focus on the characters that make the show enjoyable, which is the case in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn first look I was met with stunning visuals. I really recommend watching this in 720p or above, if you have the opportunity to. The artwork really is splendid, and they focus a whole lot on drawing beautiful scenery and backgrounds, something that you might not necessarily focus on but it does add a nice touch. The characters are animated in a high quality fashion as well, although it's debatable whether or not the derpy faces are \"high quality\". I think they are, however, since the exaggeration of expressions is sort of... Out of character? It makes for a great laugh when used properly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect that sort of caught me off guard was how good the music fits in this happy-go-lucky show. If you've seen Hanasaku Iroha and recognize the opening, that's because it's the same artist. I also get the same vibe as I did from Hanasaku Iroha as I do for Non Non Biyori, which might be a factor in this subjective review, but the music really does wonders. Although simple, it suits the (more often than not) quirky situations depicted. Great when it's time to laugh, and great when it's time to feel good or emotional.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, however, the far most important moment that makes Non Non Biyori excel are the characters. They're all unique with their own traits, good and bad, and they all share a common element; they're all quirky, to some degree. You really get to bond with them as well during the course of the show, something I really appreciated. The show really wouldn't be the same without them, which should be obvious considering that it's slice of life, but it's not as obvious in other shows (the way I see it).\\n\\n\r\nSo, to summarize, Non Non Biyori is a wonderful, short story about Renge and her friends' daily lives and struggles. With a simple story, stunning visuals, sound fit for the situations and characters that you just want to see more and more of, Non Non Biyori instantly hooks you on and before you know it you'll have watched the 12 episodes. Twice. A slice of life done right.\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but give this anime 10/10.",

            "content": "I felt at a loss when I looked at this season's anime lineup. It seemed crowded with a lot of action and supernatural-oriented shows, two genres I don't generally mesh well with, so when I saw Non Non Biyori it instantly stood out. Being a fan of the gentle, Ichigo Mashimaru-styled slice of life style, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed. \r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nStory is never a strong suit in a genre that is based around nothing really happening. Non Non Biyori doesn't bring profound storyboard elements to the table, but you can't really expect that. It instead seems tooffer very subtle undertones based on the premise of country life. The show follows Ichijou Hotaru, a 5th grader who has moved from the city to the country, and her friends, who happen to be the only other gradeschool children in town. Concepts of culture shock are touched upon lightly in Hotaru's occasional confusion of life in the country, and the connection between the main characters seems strengthened by the loneliness of being in such an underpopulated location. Story is taken lightly, as I feel it should be.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nMother of all that is holy, those backgrounds. I feel this is one of Non Non's strong suits, that being the art. A peaceful, countryside setting offers stunning scenery, and this show does not shy away from taking advantage of that. The first part of the first episode greets us with a collage of beautiful mountains coated in trees, gentle streams, and peaceful fields. The style of the characters themselves is solid and very cute, and the animation is fluid and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Non Non complements the atmosphere of the show very well. It's peaceful, quaint, and traditional. The only complaint I have is the more intense music in episode 5, but it wasn't very much of a big deal. The voices of the characters are pleasant and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nHere's where the slice of life genre shines, and Non Non doesn't fail to deliver. The anime is centric around four characters; Ichijou Hotaru, a mild-mannered fifth grader from the city, Koshigaya Natsumi, the playful sixth grader, Koshigaya Komari, the older sister of Natsumi, and Miyauchi Renge, the eccentric first grader. Each character has something interesting about them, such as Hotaru's loving obsession with her senpai Komari, Komari's sensitivity about her short stature, Natsumi's carefree nature, and Renge's... well, a lot about her is interesting. These traits are brought out through the interactions between characters in a fun, natural way.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show. It has the peace of a really gentle slice of life, but surprisingly has the ability to get me laughing or even tearing up a bit (looking at you, episode 4.) It achieves this in a subtle way that I just love to experience.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nI look forward to future episodes of Non Non Biyori. It's certainly my favorite anime of the season, and for good reason. If you liked Ichigo Mashimaru, then I feel you'd enjoy this show too.",

It's just amazing!\r\nWhen I started watching it I was down, and really tired from work and life, and I won't be exaggerating if I said this anime helped me through it! Not many shows put you in a lighter mood right away, and Non Non Biyori managed to do that every episode! I would automatically relax, and prepare myself to smile for 23 minutes and 40 seconds. It became a habit of me watching every second of that show, and it's the first time I didn't skip thestarting and ending theme, who would skip such cuteness?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime were all such unique and pure characters you'd never get sick of them, you'd want to watch each one of them more, and at one point, they all become your childhood best friends. And the character design is spot on! I guarantee you'll end up falling in love with every single character. Not to mention that the little side stories are to live for!\\n\\n\r\nWhen it come to the art style, you won't believe how magical a still image could look like until you watch this. I wished to live in the country more times than not watching this anime and looking at all the beautiful scenery. And of course the sounds are spot on, I live in a more of rural area, and whenever I heard the birds in the background, I thought I'm listening to the birds outside my windows, they were just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you ever want to just relax, smile like crazy, and just feel like the world could be an amazingly beautiful place. Or if you're just feeling down, and need a gentle hug, watch this anime, and you wouldn't be disappointed. I'm just happy there is a second season, because honestly when this one ended it felt like I was saying goodbye to my childhood friends and memories.",

That may  mean achieving a balance between career, the work of fulfilling yourself and relaxation, the work of being proud of what you did. Our enjoy life in a blissfull ignorance doing their daily chores or enjoying the littlepleasures of the countryside routine.

We don't realize it, but every single day, we experience things that shape us as people, and we have always experienced those things, ever since we were born. While I love watching a heartfelt drama, a showcase of the bigger events that can inform our most important decisions and cause the most visceral emotions, we often take for granted how valuable and important the moments in between the drama are for us. Non Non Biyori, and its sequel series Repeat, highlight all of the meaningful moments that we often take for granted. It does numerous things tocreate its nostalgic tone, create a lived-in setting, and make its characters come to life, while being one of the most hilarious and occasionally heartfelt shows out there. Few series are capable of evoking the kinds of emotions NNB does for me, and through watching its young characters grow up in the countryside and experience the milestones of childhood, it makes me appreciate my life all the more. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Non Non Biyori's artwork and character designs are bright and colorful, it doesn't take long to see that the series general tone is also infused with a tinge of melancholy, and that unique bittersweet tone is almost always there in the background. This is because every aspect of Non Non Biyori's design is made to evoke the Japanese aesthetic concept called Mono no Aware. Sounds weeby, I know, but I think this concept is vital to understanding why Non Non Biyori is so memorable and emotional. Mono no Aware is about the meaning found in things that are fleeting, about how things are beautiful because they don't last forever, and as sad as it is that things change, it was better to have experienced them at all and allow them to become memories. This aesthetic is a staple in Iyashikei anime, and many of these series are set in a location where its easy to convey this feeling. Anything involving the passage of time will do the trick, which is why most Iyashikei anime are either set in nature, or in a post-apocalyptic setting, and Non Non Biyori's setting allows the series to constantly be reminding us about the passage of time. Being set around a large, natural environment means that things such as the changing of seasons are always seen visually. As each episode passes, you will notice that more leaves are starting to fall off of trees, or the color palette changes as the sun shines in different ways. The characters activities usually relate to whatever season it is, and seeing how all of this changes over the course of the series evokes the bittersweet sensation of Mono no Aware. \\n\\n\r\nAnother big part of Non Non Biyori's tone is how run-down it is. Around all of the gorgeous nature, Non Non Biyori is set in a run-down farm town. Small, half-destroyed houses and shacks can be found in the background, and there is a sensation that there used to be far more people in this rural town then there currently are. The school the students use has broken floorboards, the signs have been written on and are cracked or off their hinges, and the place in general looks like its been eroded. Not only does this serve as excellent worldbuilding, filling this setting with odd details and making it feel lived-in, but it also helps to convey that it used to be very different, and that over time, it's changed. Though more obvious, a big thing that shows how this place has changed over time is the older characters. There aren't any high school students anymore, as they have all moved to Tokyo to go to school, only coming back to visit occasionally, all in episodes that further flesh out the history of the characters and reinforce the passage of time. Instead, it focuses on young children, or younger adults. \\n\\n\r\nMost anime about cute girls doing cute things features high-school aged characters and light coming-of-age elements. Most of these characters face some hardships about their future, and their responsibilities in school. These stories can be engaging in their own right, and many times can form the crux of a very emotional coming-of-age story (see K-On), but that's not quite what Non Non Biyori is going for. Non Non Biyori ages its characters younger than most series, ranging from the First Grader Renge to the Eighth Grader Komari, with side characters who are all older with only a few exceptions. As young kids with much fewer responsibilities, their general personalities get more opportunities to come out, and they get to act their age: like children. \\n\\n\r\nEach of the girls in this show feels like how a real child that age would act, and it makes them all more endearing and relatable. Hotaru is a 5th grader who moves to this rural village and adjusts to country life. At first, it seems she's mature and has it set, but as the series goes on we get to see her childish side come out more and more often. She idolizes the oldest girl Komari, she's gullible and falls for numerous tricks, she's curious about many things, and she gets clingy and overly whiny at times, especially around her mother. She acts differently around every character, and is in general a multi-faceted individual who feels like a believable child. The same is true for the tomboyish and troublesome Natsumi, and the wannabe adult Komari. The best example though, is Renge, who is the heart and soul of this series and a big part of what makes this series emotional core work so well. A bright and shiny first grader, Renge is overly curious and goes to explore everything she can find. She constantly asks questions, runs around on her own to find new things, takes advice from other characters way too seriously, and has an insanely random mind and will say the most insane things that almost make no sense. She's artistic, questioning, observant, and constantly taken aback by everything she experiences, looking at the world with a sense of wonder and fascination that only someone as young as her can see, as she is still learning about life and her surroundings. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest appeal of this series is in watching each of these characters grow up, experiencing the milestones that come with going through childhood. Most of these are light-hearted and fun, with very simple life lessons and a look at those days we wish we could return to, but they are treated with care and emotion. For example, one episode is about Natsumi dragging her sister to run away from home after getting blamed for something she didn't do. The two go to a hideout they made and talk for a bit, before reminiscing about the last time they had run away like this. They eventually realize that they can't really do anything without their mom, and juxtaposed with a cat feeding her kittens, the two realize they were acting like idiots and return home. Expecting to get scolded by an angry mama, instead, the two get head-pats and treated to a warm, home-cooked meal by a mother who was worried sick about her kids. It's heartwarming, nostalgic, and something I think anyone can relate to. Each of the series various plots are like that, ranging from a young Renge making a friend and eventually having to see her leave, to everyone looking back at old toys and photos/videos and cringing at how dumb they used to be. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the biggest reason for the success of this series nostalgic and bittersweet tone is in the side characters. Like I said, this is a series about watching these children grow up, and the children themselves can't really see how much they're growing. But the older characters sure can, and in seeing their relationships we get a look into how things have changed. This is most apparent in the relationship between Renge and Kaede, aka Candy Store. Having been made to raise Renge when she was only 2, the two have formed a special, inseparable bond, and many of the series most emotional moments come when Renge goes to Candy Store for certain things. As Renge's own parents are constantly working in the rice fields and her sister is always sleeping and lazy, she experiences many of her own childhood milestones with Candy Store, such as learning to ride a bike. Candy Store is watching the young Renge grow up right before her eyes, and there's a bitter-sweetness to this, knowing that while Renge won't have that sense of adorable childlike wonder anymore, she's moving to better things. Really, Renge is an encapsulation of the emotional core of this series, and I can go on about how fantastic of a character she is and how she embodies everything I love about this series (a certain episode about tadpole shrimps comes to mind). Just suffice it to say that watching her grow and learn about life was satisfying and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nI may make it sound kind of emotional, but really Non Non Biyori is light-hearted and funny. Actually, it's hilarious. Non Non Biyori has some of the best comedic timing I've seen, and basically every punchline hits and hits hard. What I love about its comedy is how restrained it can be. The series will often utilize long pauses before the characters react to something, and that reaction will usually be a bit more relaxed or deadpan than whats normal for cute girls. Beyond that, the characters are wonderfully expressive, with adorable facial expressions and specific body language that makes them a joy to hang out with beyond feeling like realistic, multi-faceted child characters. Much of the comedy also plays into the feeling of nostalgia the series emits. I remember getting way to serious about games involving school supplies as a kid, and making random games out of stupid things. It's both hilarious and nostalgic then, to see a game of \"flip the ruler\" morph into a super hype sports anime, or one of the older characters tease Renge by pretending she removed her thumb. Some of the comedy can be random, usually involving Renge's wondering thoughts, and there's even room for A MUTHAFUCKIN JOJO REFERENCE!!!! The series is silly and child-like, and it brings me back to that wonderful little time in my life. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting all of this, is Non Non Biyori's absurdly gorgeous background art. From cracks and rust in buildings, to the various colors of the four seasons, to the various memorable locations throughout, Non Non Biyori's setting is filled with details that bring it to life, and its lighting, color design, and layouts are absolutely beautiful. While the actual animation can be a bit janky at times, and never really impresses, it didn't really have to for this series. For something so focused on tone and setting, the background art and color design is paramount, and this series succeeds on that front better than most. There's very little I can say to do it justice, watch the first scene of the first episode and that should do the trick. Adding equally to this immersion is the excellent OST. It's surprisingly varied, featuring an array of both beautiful, melancholic piano tracks, and child-like comedic tunes with lots of recorders, bells, and whistles. Both OP's and ED's are excellent. The OP's depict the girls playing around in the country, with a tunes by Nano.Ripe that sound comfy, \"country,\" and fun, and the visuals keep the motif of the changing seasons, with the second OP even featuring a segment where the girls march with the music as the seasons change around them. The ED's are where the series music shines most in my eyes though. A fun, catchy song with a hint of melancholy sung by the series voice actors, set to a slide-show of them having fun together. A perfect fit, and I listen to both tracks whenever I need a dose of this show. \\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is the essence of experiencing life in its purest form, sometimes literally, as the camera has a tendency to linger in the same position for long periods of time and allow things to just play out, as if it were turned on and just left on the tri-pod with no one manning it (btw, this series has some excellent direction and cinematography to boot). It makes a point to highlight all of the beautiful things that can be found all around us every day, and tells us to treasure those things, and not take them for granted. While I'm not sure if this was the intention, my interpretation of the decision to repeat the same year in Non Non Biyori Repeat is to inform us of how much we can miss; that within a single year, there is a lot that we take for granted, and we shouldn't forget about any of the wonderful moments that made that time special. If you want a light-hearted, hilarious, Slice of Life about a group of girls experiencing the milestones of growing up, with an emotional undercurrent and a few moments that will tug at the heartstrings, you really can't do much better than Non Non Biyori. Life is a beautiful thing, and this little show wrings a lot of feelings out of reminding us of that. It's a simple message, but sometimes, that can be resonant, and here, it definitely is.",

            "content": "I haven't enjoyed a slice of life anime this much since Azumanga Daioh. This is what slice of life is all about. I'm so fucking glad this thing exists. Non Non Biyori is heartwarming, funny, relaxing, and it captures the perfect feeling of beauty and nostalgia. The whole atmosphere the anime radiates is magical, and you owe it to yourself to watch it if you enjoy beauty and the simple things in life.\r\nThe anime follows Hotaru Ichijou, who has just moved from Tokyo to some isolated village in the middle of nowhere. Here she meets the other four characters that are to become the maincast, and that is where the magic begins. They all attend the same school and the same class, because there are only like five kids in the entire village (not entirely true). This already creates a cosy atmosphere, because you have a definite set of characters that you can focus on without any distractions, and they are so masterfully written that their interactions with one another becomes a pure joy to follow. Besides the main characters there are also adults that are in some way connected to them, so there are already well-established relationships and ties, but some of these you won't learn until after a few episodes. As usual with my reviews I won't go into details about the different characters, because I believe that you should experience it yourself. You will most certainly come to love them, I'll tell you that.\\n\\n\r\nAs with all Slice of Life anime, there isn't any story present. It's all about capturing mundane everyday activities in an interesting and engaging manner, and Non Non Biyori gets full scores in this regard. The characters are all very well written, and they all contribute to the overall atmosphere and feel of the show with their own spice. The anime pays an equal amount of attention to all of them, so you're not stuck with Hotaru Ichijou only if you were worried about that, which is good because I personally find her to be the least interesting character. You get to see all the aspects of the different characters' everyday life, and it really helps you connect to them. And it's so cosy! I don't think I've ever felt this cosy while watching another anime before. There is something about the beautiful music, art, and characters that just does something to me that most other anime fail to. At times I don't know whether I want to laugh along with the characters or tear up from the sheer beauty of the show, so I find myself doing both. If I could put it one way, I would say that Non Non Biyori conjures some sort of powerful nostalgia that you didn't know that you had, so you instantly feel at home whenever you follow the girls along with their shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is a wonderful show that is the embodiment of what Slice of Life is all about, so if you're looking for something fun and relaxing then I'd highly recommend it. I wholeheartely believe that this anime is a great example that anime can be taken seriously as an art form. I was almost starting to lose hope, phew. If anything, this show raised the bar too high, so now I'll have an even more difficult time finding good SoLs. Curses.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nAnime is a medium that allows us to see some crazy combinations, from legendary heroes battling over an immortal object to drills that will pierce the heavens. But other times, anime allows us to sit back, relax, and mellow out to simply enjoy the fun antics happening on-screen. In Non Non Biyori, the show does just that, leaving you with a warm feeling when all is said and done.\r\nSTORY\r\nNon Non Biyori sets itself up by introducing a new character in the beginning, her name being Hotaru. She just recently moved from the city to the country and hasjoined the other (only) four students at the school.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is a slice of life anime. As such, my small premise has little merit as to what actually goes on throughout the rest of the show. When it comes to the episodic nature of an anime like this, it isn't important to really have an over-arcing plot that drives the narrative. And NNB does a great job in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the actual episodes/arcs are fine for what they are. However, certain arcs stick out more so than others. Without spoiling too much, I'll talk about some of my favorite arcs and what they did so well.\\n\r\nThe first one to really grab my attention was the one featuring Ren and her same-aged neighbor friend. This arc really captures what the show does well, and that is showing off the characters doing everyday things. The arc featured little dialogue, not only because Ren and her friend are children (meaning they wouldn't have deep conversations with each other to begin with) but also because it is the way in which they interacted with one another that easily showed off how good of friends they truly were. It was incredibly simple yet very touching.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great arc features Hotaru, Koma, and a same-aged neighbor once again. This arc I found demonstrated the comedy of the show quite nicely. It played up Koma's insecurity about being older yet more immature than her friends. It's combination of reaction faces, dead-pan humor, and adult-oriented jokes made me really enjoy this arc fully.\\n\\n\r\nLast one, and perhaps everyone's favorite, is the small story featuring Ren and \"Candy Store\". This one was very sweet and made you feel extremely happy when watching it. It gave off this mother-daughter vibe between the two that I found to be so lovable. They did a nice job of making you see just how much those two care about one another, and when the arc ended, I was definitely making an audible \"Aww!\"\\n\\n\r\nThere are more than just these three, but these are the ones that stuck out to me the most. Almost all of the arcs are at least fine in quality (whether that be comedy, \"feels\", etc.) but you will come to find that some are just better than the others.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here. In terms of actual animation, there isn't much to be had. What the show does well despite this is the art style and backdrops. NNB makes you truly feel as if the characters are residing in the countryside. There are wide shots with many trees and open fields. There is the lone car that passes by on the never-busy road. The characters also walk by many rice fields and animal farms. During the show, they sometimes allude to the fact that where they live is not the city, and the art of the show really helps to encapsulate this feeling.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the animation and art, I liked the look/design of the characters. Notably, while Hotaru and Koma are rather \"plain-Jane\" looking, Natsumi and Ren are pretty uniquely designed, at least comparatively among the other cast members.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori gives us characters that are just straight up fun.\\n\r\nProbably the best among them is Ren. I like kids a lot, so I'm a bit biased when I say I really liked her character. She's inquisitive and kind, but just smart enough to understand the many scenarios they are put in. A lot of her charm comes from the way she says certain things or how she acts like a kid her age would. She isn't one of the best child characters but she was always fun to see.\\n\\n\r\nKomari probably comes second character-wise. I think what I enjoyed most about her was again her child-like attitude and antics. Plus, her voice actress did a very good job. A lot of the time Komari is the butt-end of the jokes, whether this be about her height or her ineptitude at cooking. But overall, she shines best when interacting with her sister Natsumi and her good friend Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Hotaru, she is probably the most interesting of the bunch. Besides coming from Tokyo (in the sense a \"foreigner\"), she actually is the most mature (in terms of personality and, strangely, puberty). On top of this, she has this semi-yuri crush towards Komari that is surprisingly hilarious. She is rather plain in appearance (perhaps even generic) but she interacts well with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Natsumi. Personifying tomboys from across the globe, she revels in lame puns, messing with her sister, and just staying optimistic in all situations. I liked her and her sister's relationship; it wasn't \"I'm older than you\", it was more \"we are really good friends.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat probably best explains the character's interactions between each other. They are all really, really good friends.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the OP and ED were not too outstanding. The OP has this beginning part to the track (literally the first five seconds) that reminds me of underwater levels in video games. The ED is definitely very child-like with its singing and use of instruments, and fit nicely with the shows themes.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly found the rest of the soundtrack to be pretty good. Like the art style, it evoked feelings of the country. For many of the pieces, they would remind me of The Legend of Zelda village themes or general outdoor areas. They have a certain fantastical feel to them that I enjoyed. Furthermore, like the ED, some of them seemed like they were more \"playful\" (that is, performed with children in mind) and always put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the voice acting, I think everyone did an above average job in each of their performances. Special shout-outs to Natsumi, Ren, Hotaru, and Koma!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis show definitely puts you in a good mood. It's very relaxing, with the right amount of comedy and happy feelings. It's not dramatic nor is it suspenseful. When you're watching you know you can just sit back a bit and enjoy the humorous nature of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I absolutely loved this one, but it is for sure very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, slice of life arcs with some stand-out favorites\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, country-style art is pleasing and atmospheric\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, likable and lovable\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, OP and ED are average but soundtrack and VAs nailed it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, chill out and have some fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Important Note - Be sure to stick with this anime for at least 4-5 episodes before making your decision about the entire show. These 2 episodes are a bit dull and slightly boring but the rest is enchanting and remarkable. I won't say that these episodes are bad or anything but as compared to rest of show, a bit too normal. Don't immediately judge it even if you don't find it to your liking, give it a proper chance. This is surely not your ordinary moe-moe kyun show. Instead is sweet, lovable and rich.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"Nyan-pasu!\" \r\n-\r\nHave you ever felt,\r\n\"Wow, this show is simply spectecular. I needmore people to watch it, need more people to discuss it with and just don't want it to ever end\"\\n\\n\r\nIf not, then look no further because \"Non non Biyori\" is there for you. This anime is the most relaxing anime, and one of the most entertaining anime I have ever watched. Life is too short and ends too abruptly, our worries and troubles affect us more than we think they are - Why don't we make the best of time while we are still alive, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nIn one word, I would describe this anime as a \"Healer\" as it heals all your anxiety and worries, and replaces those with a warm and happy feeling, the feeling we seem to have forgotten in our tiresome and repetitive daily routine of our respective lives. I am not gonna joke when I say this, the healing element in this show is exclusively high here. It show makes you laugh you laugh from the bottom of your heart. It doesn't overly MOE-tize anything, nor make everyone super-clumsy or astereotype. Shows of this kind are easy to mess up, as the girls are shown to be all about moe and their personality is completely forgotten. But worry not as this anime is nothing like that. Sure, it has cute girls doing cute things, but unlike a regular series, it knows what to do and when to do. You will be grinning and smiling at their cute actions, but this feeling is not temporary. You actually grow to love the characters, and this feeling can be felt in the finally episode especially. \\n\\n\r\nAs a reminder, I am a huge slice of life genre lover, having watched countless SOL shows, loving some particular ones more, others less. When it first started, I was heavily biased towards it. I was like,\" It has great animation, good characters but it's a very dull and a bit boring. Meh, an average SOL.. but I guess, I will stick to it\".\\n\\n\r\n As you can see, my expectations had gone low. My views didn't change until I watched the 3rd episode, where it became impressively good. . From there and onwards, it didn't look back. Few episodes more and I was a fan, waiting for this anime every week in true words. It just didn't seem like the same show anymore. I am very, very glad that I continued it, and felt a bit bad for misunderstanding it at first. It is one of those \"Hidden gems\"  which tend to be slighltly ignored, somewhat of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nInshort, \"THIS is the ride to remember.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo we have got Hotaru, a 5th grader (Yup she is, get used to it... even if some things mislead you :p) who moves on to the countryside due to her father's job transfer. At her new school, everyone is of different ages, and in different grades, ranging from 1st to 9th.  There she meets the main cast and her soon-to-be-friends - the prank lover, 7th grader Natsumi: the adorable and everyone's favorite, 1st grader Renge: and finally 'striving to be adult' 8th grader Komari. Also there is a lazy teacher who loves sleeping more than teaching. The show begins a bit awkward, you get to know the cast and become accustomed to the relaxing air this show. In the first two episodes, nothing much happens. Once you get the hang of it, it starts feeling natural. Everything just starts to flow gradually, and you feel that the show has come alive.\\n\\n\r\nFor people who like SOL genre but have grown tired of the repetitiveness, this show is highly recommended. It is different and more unique as it takes place in a countryside instead of your good ol' city adventures. Another difference which makes this show more memorable and interesting than the rest, is the difference in age. I've never seen a classroom, ranging from 1st grade - 9th grade all at the same time. At first it felt a bit strange, seeing a kid in the same classroom with some teenagers but as I watched more, it gradually grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nBeware of the yuri vibes though. Hotaru has an innocent (but lovable) on one of her senpais i.e. Komari. I am not a yuri fan, but this, I didn't mind at all. Infact, I really enjoyed it as the excitement from a sweet and pure girl like Hotaru when she gets to be around Komari, is really something to see. Even If you don't like yuri then relax, these vibes are not as strong as a proper yuri show. You can pretty much give it an okay signal as a platonic love interest, due to it being an enjoyment enhancer. I don't think that there is need for that as yuri fan or not, you will definitely enjoy it.The best thing about this show is that it doesn't try to be complex, it knows that it doesn't need to be. It is simple, sweet and lovely, just what you would expect from this genre. It has many relatable scenes, sibling quarrels are noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not extraordinary, the story is still more special than an average one due to the countryside theme so +1 for that. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is the first aspect in which the anime truly shines - Art direction is pure 24 carat gold! It fully uses the potential of the setting to it's peak. Expect some mouthwatering scenery, the detailed animatio and the beautiful countryside. The mountains, The ponds, The farms, The trees, The flowers. Everything is colorful, vibrant and simply delicious, you just want to grab your screen and eat the gorgeous animation away. I have never had the urge to watch an anime in HD as much as I did for Non non Biyori, and so I did. I watched every episode in HD and had lots of fun admiring the magnificient sight.\\n\\n\r\n More than anything, this show is consistent. The quality does not drop an inch from start to finish. You can see the passion, it's like the director didn't slouch for a second, nor was careless. The attention and effort being put into it is admirable. There are some still images too. Normally, those would turn the people off. Who wants a show with screens frozen for what-seems-like-eternity, but this shows is the proof that if used well, even still images can help portray the emotions of the characters well. \\n\\n\r\nI must say I am very much impressed with the art director. If he could do this well with a small-medium budget then what would happen if it had a high budget? Just the though is endearing So kudos to the the studio for providing us with such richfullness, colorfulness and gorgeousness. 10/10, can't cut any marks from here, it is one of the strongest points of this show. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven in sound aspect, this anime doesn't lose its shine. The sound track consists of some soothing and relaxing pieces which puts your mind to ease. The sound of cicadas, the running water, the rustling water. Ah, the feels. It takes you back to countryside and you feel like running through the lush-green grass, open your arms wide and feel the wind. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors have done their job very well. I am just in love with Renge's voice, she has a very cute and fitting voice upon listening which, you put on a smile. The way she talks is really adorable. Who can forget the trademark line of this show i.e. \"Nyanpasu!\" - She is the inventor(just shows how creative she actually is) Same goes for everyone: The mischevious voice of Natsumi really suits her image, Komari's childish voice goes well with her personality, Hotaru's voice has a certain depth to her which suits her outer mature appearance. Likewise, for everyone.The opening and ending tracks are appropriate for this show as they are relaxing to hear and not a mind stress.The endingsong starts a bit lousy, but it is done on purpose to fit the lazy theme of the show. It becomes quite catchy in the mid all the \\n\\n\r\nway to end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters huh.\\n\\n\r\nActually I wasn't accepting anything from the characters when I first started the show. I expected regular stereotypes, but man, how wrong I was. Instead, I got some lively characters who are memorable and believable. Character attachment aspect is surprisingly high and you can't help but have atleast one or two favorites. Usually, there are one or two characters whom you just don't like, but in this anime - none. The writer knows how to make his/her character interesting without overdramatizing anything, and that's what makes them great. The bonds between everyone here feels realy, sweet and enlights a warm feeling inside you. \\n\\n\r\nWe have Natsumi who is ultra-mischevious and somewhat tomboyish. She loves teasing others and having fun. Her elder sister, Komari-chan is the most often victim of her misbehaviors. She is not good at studies, doesn't mean she can'do it. She just... doesn't study. Also her mother is fearsome whenever she does something bad. Those moments are very funny and you feel like relating to her. There is always a scary mothers\\n\\n\r\nRenge-chan is the kiddo of the group, but she is no ordinary kiddo! She is inspirational, interesting and a hinted-to-be-genius. She loves to draw and is a quite talented artist . Inventing new words, and making unique jokes are her hobby. She is one of the most unique characters, not only in appearance but also in personality. There is something extraordinary about her which makes her shine.\\n\\n\r\nKomari is a height complex and is constantly striving to be mature and cool, but things just don't go well for her. She is the older sister of Natsumi, but looks younger, something which puts pouts on her mouth. But that doesn't mean she is gonna give up any sooner, she will try again and again, no matter how circumstances lead, and that's what I love how about her. She is the 'good kid' of the family and the one who doesn't want to get in other people's way. Easily scared, has flaws but who doesn't? She is cute and sweet.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is, arguably, the main character of the show. She is a bit too tall for her age and is mature - Total opposite of Komari who is clumsy and immature but this doesn't stop her from loving her kawaii senpai. She loves spending time with Komari, be it cooking, shopping, sleeping in the same bed (kotatsu to be exact) or just sitting around. What I love about her is, even if she has a unusual fondness for Komari, she doesn't ignore others. She talks with everyone and have fun with everyone, it's just that Komari holds a bit more special existence to her.\\n\\n\r\nAlso we have Kaede aka \"candy shop\" by Renge and her friends (believe me - that's how they call her) She is a very cool onee-san and shares a sweet bond with Ren which is something you got to watch. Suguru who is the emotionless and a good-at-anything kind of brother of Komari and Natsumi. He is 9th grader and the most interesting thing about him is that he doesn't speak much. love how this series becomes a \"spot the onii-san\" as he rarely appears, but when he does - be prepared as the hilarity ensues. There are some other minor characters as well, all of which are nice and interesting but sadly, don't get enough screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe fun thing is that you not only laugh with your characters, but also feel angry and sad with them. It's like you can feel their emotions and feel a part of yourself inside them. It isn't an easy task to do, it takes guts and skill to be able to make the audience feel 'one' with its characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n\"Non non Biyori\" and \"Enjoyment\" can be described as alternatives of each other, as it doesn't have a single moment which you are not enjoying. It does everything more than good, and doesn't lose sight of its objective - Be a relaxing series.\\n\\n\r\nI laughed. I didn't cry (Why would I, when it is just so focused on making me grin like a silly kid?) I waited for it every week, and when it ended, I missed it continuously for atleast a week. I still do... When it first started, I had high expectations but I had reduced them after watching the first episode. As it went on and on and as I got immersed into the series, it grew on me to the point that I began to count days for it's next episode. It has the 'X' factor to it which makes it one of the most memorable series of the year. It is a hope that there are still good, honest shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show and be relax, and relaxed and relaxed. It is a powerful spell which heals everything like one of those cure spell in rpg games. It will soothe your mind, and calm you down even when you are having some major worries going on. Another plus point is that it is highly rewatchable with some excellent quality art, delightful characters and gentle music. I highly recommend it to those who are too tired of the real life and need a break. This will be your breaking point, and a point to reminisce.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's \"Nyanpasu-ing desu\" (bad pun)",

            "content": "I honestly feel quite bad that I'm giving this such a low rating compared to everyone else. But oh man... I had to finish this anime on double speed just so I can finish it... \r\nI am not a huge fan of slice of life, but I don't hate it either. And since Renge is such a meme on the interwebs, I decided to watch it... But oh my goodness. Definitely not MY cup of tea.\r\n(Since this is a slice of life and there practically is no plot, I'll just decide to give 5/10.) I thought the  art was quite nice. The scenery waspeaceful, the characters were quite cute, no doubt about that. The sound was... Alright. There was nothing memorable, in my opinion anyway. But oh, the characters... The characters. The only thing that's stopping me from giving it a 1/10 is Hotarun and Suguru, and I'll explain why. \\n\\n\r\nThis is just my personal opinion, but I personally detest characters who act/are way stupider than their age. And I know anime is never realistic, but this was just WAY too much. Maybe it's because the characters grew up on the countryside without proper education, but honestly... Really? The idiocy of the characters weren't cute to me at all, it just pissed me off. (It makes sense that my favorite loli character is Shiro from NGNL, who I believe is around the same age as Komari.) I really should have just dropped it at the first couple of episodes, but the reason I stuck with it was the older brother. He was literally my favorite character even though he didn't speak a word. And at least, Hotarun was bearable... Although she was also way too mature for her age (physically and psychologically), it was better than having such stupid characters trying to go through their daily life. I felt my brain cells dying one by one as I was trying to watch this normally, and soon I was watching it at 4 times the original speed.\\n\\n\r\n Although the characters' designs were cute, I felt like I was watching a kids' show. Renge is still a good meme, but this anime personally didn't fit my taste. However feel free to watch it if you're a huge slice of life fan.",

            "content": "This show, all by itself, easily, definitively, and singlehandedly defines the entire purpose, appeal, and point of an entire genre of anime... or at least a good subset of it.\r\nTo me, there are four main subsets to slice-of-life (which I totally didn't steal from Subsonic Sparkle): gag-driven, character-driven, moe, and pure iyashikei. This show fits very well in the gag-driven category with its abundant (and incredible) use of humour. It does have aspects of the other three subsets, but don't expect the show to share the same mood or style as shows of the other categories tend to have. There are definitely moments when thecharacters absolutely shine, but, unlike many other great character-driven shows (such as Hidamari Sketch), those moments tend to be fewer and farther from each other and the characters lack that certain depth good character-driven shows have. There are cute girls however there's not really many other cute things in the show unlike other top-tier moe slice-of-lifes where every single aspect of the show is specifically designed to be cute (like GochiUsa). It's much closer to pure iyashikei, with a surprisingly larger focus on calmness and peace than most other gag-driven slice-of-lifes, than to the other two categories however, it's still not quite there. Many others would classify this as an iyashikei type of show, but, to me, pure iyashikei has this special relaxing, calm, and beautiful tone that can only be described as contemplative or meditative or even philosophical. The show could have that and many times it does (the first two and a half minutes of the show is literally just background art with the show's wonderfully great main theme being played), however, due to its more plentiful comedy and often immature characters which can not at all be considered or described reflective or pensive. This show is indeed a slice-of-life and it is one of THE slice-of-lifes out there, however I seriously hope to clearly establish that this show is not the same as many other slice-of-life shows from different subsets of the genre. Simply put, it is a gag-driven slice-of-life and it holds this identity with all its heart and soul. It is not anything else. Don't expect anything GochiUsa-like, Hidamari Sketch-like, or Amanchu-like anywhere near this show.\\n\\n\r\nWell, since I've already explicitly stated that this show doesn't have very deeply written characters, I might as well discuss that now.\\n\\n\r\nThis show does not have the most deeply written characters. They're all extremely likable and, at some points, surprisingly relatable, however, if you're looking for anyone who you can have the deepest of connections with or anyone who could interest you beyond a good injection of comedy or the occasional relatability or anyone whose character can be analyzed more than two or three layers deep or anyone with motivations any more complicated than the shallow desires of grade schoolers and lazy twenty-somethings (eat, sleep, sleep more) or anybody that has any qualities or facets other than the few they all center themselves upon (although they build upon those characteristics pretty well especially for the sake of comedy) or anyone who has thoughts, emotions, and feelings other than about anything that has just happened, is happening, or will happen within an immediate timeframe then you are out of luck with this show. The characters are all painted very well with an exorbitant amount of likability and a touch of relatability however, if you take a look at them with a fine-toothed comb, you'll discover that the characters this show has are all relatively cardboard when compared to other slice-of-lifes. (Although the fact that you still have to look at them closer to notice this is indeed a plus).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you expect any sort of development in this show of any sort revolving around the characters, any character development or relationship development or something, there is little. There is some character development within each episodic story arc, however these small character changes are designed to be so minimal that they won't be too noticed or are able to be easily forgotten without much sacrifice to the show's integrity because the show, I choose to believe, follows the old classic television rule of status quo continuity which was established so that anyone can just jump in into any episode in any order just by flipping through the channels without being alienated.\\n\\n\r\nThis show, as I said earlier, doesn't have the most deeply-written characters and I believe I've summed up why earlier (and all in a single sentence too). Nevertheless, I do indeed think it irresponsible of me to make these judgements without citing a good and proper supporting example.\\n\\n\r\nLet me take our main(-est) protagonist here, Hotaru Ichijou, as our wonderful wonderful subject for today. She's a very kind girl who looks mature, already very much like a teenager, however as a matter of fact is only in fifth grade and thinks and acts like a fifth grader. She's very self-conscious, soft-spoken, shy (although all in a very lovable way), but excessively panicky, obsessive, and enthusiastic whenever she's doing something related to her crush on her senpai, Komari Koshigaya (who is also a girl making Hotaru a lesbian; this fact is never mentioned or commented on outright by the show which I'm sure will pleasantly surprise some people and annoy some others) which is her entire comedic point. She also really enjoys the countryside a fair bit more than the city even if she expected to feel alienated, and she wishes that she can spend the rest of her life there together with her friends. Aaaaaannd... that's it. That's her entire character and is the furthest a reasonable person (or at least I) can analyze about her. There are some other small details such as her skills with cooking and knitting, and these small details do add nuance and weight towards each character, however they're very minimal and trivial when it comes down to it, telling us nothing about Hotaru we don't already know about or expect from her. At this point, I'm inclined to admit that I am kind of underselling her character a bit. There are probably a few more characteristics, details, motivations, or character I missed or merely brushed upon and many of the traits and motivations I have stated are indeed built upon to an extent. However this should give you of the basic idea for what not to expect from this show's characters. This show does not have the complex thoughts and emotions Yuno from Hidamari Sketch has, nor are there any of the strong and powerfully-developed relationships such as Cocoa and Chino's in GochiUsa, nor does it have the great but subtle character development of the soldiers in Sora no Woto. To put it simply, don't watch this show for deeply-written characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo, now you may ask: What exactly makes this show so 'genre-defining' when it doesn't even have properly written characters?\\n\\n\r\nTo which I shall answer: I never said they weren't well-written. I said they weren't very deeply-written. You see, I defined the four main subsets of slice-of-life earlier because shows from each subset have very key differences in their requirements for their characters. Non Non Biyori is not a character-driven slice-of-life (in the context of the four subsets), but a gag-driven slice-of-life with a hint of iyashikei, and, in this context, this show knows exactly how to use the characters it has given life.\\n\\n\r\nI have three conditions for a well-written character: likability, relatability, and nuance. If a character manages to achieve at least one of these conditions, then I would consider them well-written. (Although this also depends on the context of the character and what their role is in the story, e.g. if a character is ONLY likable in a show in the psychological genre). Let's get back to what I was talking about earlier. I said that Non Non Biyori's characters, the show's body and soul, lacked depth. They lacked layers. They were rather two-dimensional and uninteresting in terms of character analysis. They lacked nuance. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I also stated that these characters are all extremely likable. They manage to charm you very very well and very very quickly. Every character has this sort of aura written into them that is expressed wonderfully well through every action they take (props to the animators) to every interaction they make with others. They don't need depth when they have charisma. To me, a well-written character has to make viewers care about them. They hook you in and form emotional connections with you. When a nuanced character captures your interest while a relatable character reels up a viewer's old experiences, a likable character catches you with his charm and wit. And boy. These characters do have charm and wit. Believe me. They're the most charming little buggers I've seen in a long goddamn while.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's analyze why they're so likable.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with character design. They're your basic moe fanfare. Even if I don't think there's anything different about the way they're drawn (except Renge-chan) compared to other moe anime, it's hard to deny that they're all pretty cute and work well as cute characters in a slice-of-life comedy. Meaning: straight away from the looks, they've got charm. Renge-chan is a good example of this. We've got her entire personality onto those flat-topped eyes of hers, expressing a sort of sleepy curiosity which falsely creates an image of sarcastic boredom until you look closer and see that these static-looking eyes portray more naive enthusiasm than any other lesser moe five year old preschooler can dream to have. Immediately, you can tell all this. There's a lot to be gained from good character design that many people do not realize. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the next logical step from here would be character acting, as in, how the character expresses their emotions through the animation. And I'd have to say, it's pretty top-notch. All the facial expressions are diverse enough for each of them to be able to stand out and, when combined with their character designs, portray just the right amount of emotion for the job, from the faces the characters make whenever a gag hits to the rich subtlety of their countenances during the show's rich character moments. They're all very expressive and, although most won't notice it, they actually contribute a large majority towards the likability and charisma of the characters. Compared to other shows, I don't think it's any more diverse than what other shows have in their facial department, but I noticed that this show manages to capture just as much emotion without reaching to the exaggerated heights other shows do. There is much exaggeration at times however it exaggerates in a scarcer and more tasteful way than most shows do. A great example again here would be Renge-chan. Those triangular mouth and flat-topped eyes may seem like an expression limiter, however they actually end up boosting the emotion she expresses. She's actually the single character in the show who can express not the most emotion but the most realistic amount of emotion in the show condensed in a single moment. There's this bit in episode four. I won't spoil it because it's absolutely beautiful. I'll just say that Renge-chan expresses an emotion that is so unbelievably realistically raw all through the power of facial expression (and top-notch voice acting). It's not at all exaggerated. It's just so real. It fits so perfectly with Renge-chan as a preschooler, too young to hold back tears well but already too old to cry excessively. It's beautiful. And there's none of that typical anime exaggeration involved. They just managed to make it so realistic. (Episode four was a great episode by the way.) And this is coming from someone who absolutely hates those short, emotional, appeal-to-pathos videos.\\n\\n\r\nNow, those were just the visual aspects of a character, the components dominated by the animator instead of the writer. They're not the most important parts of a character and won't make or break a character in any way, however they contribute a surprising amount more in character building than most people realize. But enough of that. The animator may hold importance, but the writer still holds supreme. What, in the script, makes them so likable?\\n\\n\r\nLet me just bring up an example here. There's this moment in episode seven when Hotaru and Renge are trapped in a rabbit pen. I won't tell you why they were stuck in there because I don't want to spoil too much, however they get stuck in there with nobody knowing their whereabouts to be able to check on them. There's this moment of silence, both in much shock, then Hotaru just freaks out. She starts crying about not being able to go home tonight and get to taste her mom's stew which she was promised they were going to eat tonight. She then starts screaming the word 'stew' repeatedly (in a Japanese accent too) as her face floods with tears. I love this moment. I've already repeatedly watched it several times just for the fun of the whole thing. I eventually did stop laughing, but I still have this wide permanent smile on my cheeks that seem to never come off. It really is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes me wonder here. Why do I love this moment so much? Well, as I've stated before, the character acting was pretty awesome. Hotaru's face the entire time was a masterpiece worthy of praise and, without it, the moment may have not worked at all. There was also great comedic timing. The entire gag wasn't structured according to the timing I expected, but it landed just as well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I think the real reason I loved this moment so much was because it just fit so well with Hotaru's character. This moment was just so Hotaru. You'd expect this kind of panicky childish desperation from her at that given moment even when it catches you off-guard. It's just like one of those moments when you hear about what one of your friends did and you just think about how that's just SO him. Hotaru as a character had already been really well-characterized from the start as the kind of character who'd do such a thing like that. We got to know her. It's not just enough for a character to have no hateable characteristics (although that's still very key to having likeable characters). We need to get to know who these characters really are to the fullest. This show has some very strong character introduction. We get to know these characters the minute we get to see them. Of course, we don't literally get to know everything about these characters. There are still many things about the characters that are added on gradually throughout the series. However, we do get a very good idea about what these characters are straight away. I mean, look at how Renge-chan's introduced. The first character in the show, she's introduced walking on her own playing a recorder fairly badly (however somehow not missing any notes) and the first thing she says is \"Are we really in the country?\" very innocently as she looks at a cow. This practically tells us everything we need to know about the character and opens with a gag immediately. The fact that the characters are very simple actually helps out with this too. They're very easy to sum up in even a matter of seconds. Of course, this does not mean that complex multifaceted characters can't have strong character introductions too. Simplicity just helps a bit. Nevertheless, all of this is foreshadowed by the fact that they simply have very likable characteristics. All of them have positive and negative traits that allow us to love them so well. They all have some positive traits we can admire of them and negative traits that we can relate with. They just have lovable traits that are all both engaging and very good at sparking comedy. It's really that simple.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's my opinion on the characters, and now, I think the next logical step would be towards how this show uses these characters to create or convey a message or tone. Why exactly is it so genre-defining?\\n\\n\r\nNow, first of all, I just want you all to know that I am not at all an expert at comedy. I can analyze (and overanalyze) any narrative work just fine, but if I were ever to dissect a joke into its constituents, it would just end up an off-putting mess. I'm sure if I think about it hard enough, maybe I'd get even a semblance of an idea of how this show's comedy works so well, but I don't want to spend years writing this article. Sure, this is most definitely intellectual laziness, this I will admit, but I do want to finish this review before dinner. For now, I can only tell you this.\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny. It's really funny. It takes the anime comedic style, refines it, and gives it the right characters for the job, all while sprinkling a bit of the precious iyashikei nostalgia that outright defines it. It's not too unique from other slice-of-life shows however it manages to stand on its own. There wasn't any time where I thought that one of the jokes didn't land. Maybe I'm just easy to please when it comes to comedy, but I found this show much more consistently funny than most other shows are. KonoSuba and Sakamoto desu ga? had moments that made me laugh really hard, much harder than with Non Non Biyori, however they had many misses too. Not all their jokes managed to land and they weren't that funny almost half the time. Non Non Biyori has a more stable sort of comedy. It doesn't reach the comedic heights other comedies do, but it is more consistent in their comedy than most other comedies do.\\n\\n\r\nSo after all this, why is the show so genre-defining? Simple. It's consistently funny with incredibly likable characters. It's a good benchmark for the kind of show it is. What this show is is the very definition of what the gag-driven slice-of-life is. There are many shows of the same kind that fail because of a lack of a lovable cast or simply not being funny. This show stands out not because of how different it is from other shows but how well it defines the genre it is in.\\n\\n\r\n(I wonder why I had to spend three thousand words just to establish that.)\\n\\n\r\nWell, now that I've established all that, let me get to some other miscellaneous points before I end here.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art is great. Props to whoever made them. The CGI vehicles though? Not so much. Luckily, all the CGI is placed out-of-view so they don't bother the viewer. All the other artwork? Eh. It's fine. Typical of Silver Link to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nI'm a music expert as much as I am a comedy expert. I can't describe music at all. However, I do at least know what I feel about them. I do love the main theme of this show. Hidamari Michi is a wonder to behold. It actually got popular enough to be used by a Dark Souls video. The rest of the soundtrack not derivative of the main theme are pretty good too. They've all got this laidback fun vibe. One of them is just Row Row Row Your Boat but made incredibly more relaxing. It's almost at par with Hidamari Sketch's relaxed circus jazz (as I said, can't describe music at all). The opening theme though doesn't strike me as well though. Although it's not a typical anime opening theme, it's a typical J-Pop song that doesn't really have anything special to it. However, the ending theme was pretty goddamn amazing. I love it.  It's so unique with all the bells and moe. I love it.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I enjoyed this show. Sure, its characters weren't that deeply-written, but what does that matter when all the show wants to do is make you feel good? Its characters are incredibly likable and the show is incredibly funny. While I do still think the show would've vastly improved if the characters had a touch more depth to them, I still believe this show's still a great gag-driven comedy and it really does make you feel good in the end. The music's also very memorable and so is the background art. Overall, I'd rate it eight over ten, just above K-On! but still quite a bit away from Hidamari Sketch's first season.",

Just following a group of girls going to school, as well as out of school activites. But it's more than that. The writers on this show are really something else. They are very funny, without clearly making jokes. Whether it's Renge shouting \"Jumbo!\" as a big dragonfly flies overhead, or Komari having a crisis over how short she is, there is something special about how the characters express themselves, that feels so genuine, you can'thelp but get lost in their small, cloistered world.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a sit back and enjoy kinda show. You don't have to follow a long narrative, expect twists, or wonder what's going to happen next. It's a great show, and one that is great for reasons that are far too rare in anime.",

Surely the 2013 anime of studio Silver Link, Non non Biyori, would come out on the very top.\r\nSo you are tired after a long day working/studying? You feel bad after watching a top drama or you get a headache after watching mindfucking show? Just watch Non non biyori, its the chicken soup for the soul. It will warm your heart and cure your soul.\r\nThe story takes place in the countryside village of Asahigaoka, a place lacking the many of the conveniences that people from the city are accustomed to. The neareststores are miles away and the school consists of only five students, each of whom is in a different grade of elementary or middle school. Hotaru Ichijo, a fifth grader from Tokyo, transfers into Asahigaoka Branch School and has to adjust to countryside life with her new friends.\\n\\n\r\nIf i were a child again, i would want the exact same life in this anime. It is restful, joyful and vital. Every characters are so nice but everyone has their own problems and that make it close to realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link has done a wonderful job to the animation of this show. Everything is bright, colorful. It's like a lifeful painting. The characters are well drawn, detailed. The soundtrack are simply amazing. It fit the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nFor slice of life fan, this one has my highest recommendation. A show that cant be passed.\\n",

            "content": "Non Non Biyori (lit. Non Non Weather), \r\nis a slice of life and a comedy anime that I would easily recommend to both young and older viewers. From the very first episode on to the end of season two, viewer\u2019s interest remains captivated and soothed through the portrayal of pristine environments, thoroughly enjoyable and quirky adventures of its characters, and a calming soundtrack. There is much charm to the serene and slowly paced storyline, which is dynamically complemented by the incremented character development of a whimsical cast. Thus, if you wish to relax, laugh, and enjoy life; I couldn\u2019t recommend this anime enough.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe storyis fitting of the (SOL) genre, and has high rewatch value. Twenty minute-long episodes are segmented such that each new day in the countryside village of Asahigaoka is presented along with its quirky laughs, disputes and unique adventures.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nMuch attention and care has been invested into the artwork. This is witnessed through the impressive background scenery. As examples, viewers are presented with a view of rocks within a stream of running water, the gentle sway amongst fields of grass in the wind, as well as a buzzing reminder as to surrounding insect life. The smooth and perfect visual integration of movement or processes within nature such as these, all serve to bring the scenes and its interrelated components towards a nearer degree of reality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe songs utilized for the opening (by nano.RIPE) and ending (by ZAQ), are fitting to the anime\u2019s theme and exceptional recordings that are well worth checking out. The original soundtrack is even more impressive, where the composer Hiromi Mizutani strikes dissonant notes at seemingly perfect times, dualistically capturing the essence of nature and its fragility through the simple and off key sounding of a child\u2019s recorder (aka Renchon\u2019s melody). Also too, I now acknowledge the excellent use of silence in many situations within this anime; I can ascertain that it has served as most effective in enhancing viewer\u2019s (such as myself) emotional perceptibility and relatedness towards the characters during concurrent situations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe cast is rather simplistic, but individually they are also quirky and unique; each in their own ways. This is further conducive towards enabling many comedic moments all throughout the anime. In addition, a case can be made in regards to the prevalence of a sh\u014djo atmosphere, this is because almost all characters are female, and the few males are rendered insignificant to the point that it is funny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAs the story revolves around charming, and adorable girls, this means that inciting incidents mainly involve goofing around, dodging chores, and having fun in any which way possible. Then, from this I conclude that the degree of enjoyment derived from this anime lies in the beholder; in other words, that it depend\u2019s on viewer\u2019s preference or their appreciation for simplistic themes such as innocence and play.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThank you for reading,\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy~\\n",

            "content": "Are you all ready for another slice of life comedy about a group of ladies? I've reviewed quite a few of these and, to be fair, they're usually enjoyable enough. Non Non Biyori came out, in anime form, in late 2013. It's based on a still ongoing manga by Atto that started in 2009. The anime was brought to us by Silver Link, the same studio behind Baka to Test, WataMote, Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry &, the only good thing I've seen from them thus far, Yuri Kuma Arashi. I have to say, that pedigree does not inspire confidence. But let's take a look atthe series and see if it can bring Silver Link's numbers up to two worthwhile anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open in the country with a school where one teacher takes care of all the elementary and middle school students. Her job may  sound terribly difficult until you learn that she has all of five students. Our main characters are the four girls in the class. The first grader, Renge. Fifth grader Hotaru. Seventh grader, Natsumi & her older sister, eighth grader Komari. The four of them enjoy their quiet and peaceful lives while keeping one another company and interacting with the friendly folks in their little country town. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the ways this slice of life series about a group of girls differentiates itself from other slice of life series about groups of girls is with the country setting and the fairly substantial age differences among the girls. To be fair, that is a pretty big difference and the series is good at taking advantage of both the setting and the age gaps for the sake of humour. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the humour isn't always on the mark. There are times where they'll rely on doing something odd to be fun without regard to the fact that odd does not necessarily equate to funny. This does result in some jokes that fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are pretty nicely done. They aren't the most complex group out there, but they are nicely fleshed out without being overly exaggerated. Resulting in characters who have a nice level of verisimilitude. The character interactions are also nicely done. A lot of the funniest scenes in the series revolve around the interactions. In fact, the best comedic moments in this series may all stem from Hotaru's interactions with Komari. It's not  just the comedy, I'll also give the series credit for having some strong emotional moments that just explore the connections among the characters. Particularly with Renge & Kaede, a side character who runs the candy store.  That being said, some of the side characters are a bit weak. You get some sense of personality from them, but it's not much. Like the one male student who never talks and is just kind of a supportive brother to Konami & Natsumi or  Renge's eldest sister, who acts as the school teacher and has a lazy shtick going. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this is quite good. Particularly the nature scenes and backgrounds. The nature scenery in this is really superb. The characters look fine, but they're also pretty typical of the genre.  The various objects that the characters interact with are nicely detailed. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOur major characters are voiced by Murakawa Rie (GochiUsa's Megumi), Asumi Kana (Neptunia's Blanc), Sakura Ayane (Love Live's Arisa) & Koiwai Kotori. The four of them give strong performances. As does Satou Rina. The biggest weakness is Nazuka Kaori. Wile she is a good actress, as evidenced by her performances in Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood & Soul Eater, her character in this just doesn't have much going for her so she spends the entire anime sounding mellow without any real emotional variation. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. Hotaru openly has a massive crush on Komari. There's also some indication that the feelings are reciprocated. I wouldn't be surprised if the two of them ended up dating at some point. Probably won't last, given their young ages, though. Then again, if Nanoha and Fate can make it work, it's possible.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThat was Non Non Biyori. It holds up pretty strongly. The characters are memorable and endearing. The nature scenes are lovely and it has enough differences from the standard slice of life series to keep it fresh. That being said, I wouldn't call it one of the best out there, since the humour does fall short at times. But if you want something cutesy with some very strong character interactions, this might be for you. My final rating is going to be a solid 8/10. Next week I'll take a look at Binbougami ga.",

Moreover, it highlights the daily happenings of the characters' lives. how they spend their times having fun but at the same time their struggles as students. Quite a good storyline,. Only criticism i can give the storyline is... its too slow paced at parts. Hence a 9 for the storyline.\r\nArt: Again, similar to Yuru Camp in that the animation of the scenery and the art is beautiful, especially the sakuras. Character animation cant really compare to YuruCamp though, its less how should i say, refined than Yuru Camp's. A 9 for the art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Relaxing osts, decent opening and ending songs. Great sounds of the background, well deserving of a 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are pretty cute so a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I certainly enjoyed watching it, though at times it was a little boring due to how slow paced the anime is. A 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, everything is good about this anime. Definitely enjoyed watching it. A final score of 9/10!",

            "content": "Series like these are the reason I like writing reviews. Forget complex plotlines and settings. Deep character backgrounds and drama. Romance and fanservice. Be prepared for some adventures in the countryside with some of the most loveable cast of characters you could find in a slice of life series.\r\nThe fall season came and things got cold. But thankfully enough there are heartwarming series like these being produced to keep your spirits high up and a smile on your face at any time of the day. Non Non Biyori is a slice of life in the purest sense of the term, using simple characters and asimple setting with clever scripting to bring out the best that the slice of life genre has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nEverything starts when the transfer student Hotaru moves into the countryside to join the small elementary school there only to find out that there's literally 5 students in total and one single teacher in the entire facility. And to top it off all of them are in different grades. Big changes are going to happen in Hotaru's life as she goes from being in a city environment to a country side one. Developing friendships with all the students in her classroom and discovering all the fun things you have in the country that you couldn't get in a big city like Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows an episodical format as per usual in these kinds of series. With each episode focusing on one or two little stories that involve some or all of the main girls. The main focus is soft gag comedy, no exaggeration or over the top innuendos, just simple comedy with a nice touch of slapstick humor thrown in there at times to make you chuckle once in a while. Everything is done smoothly and without overcomplications, allowing more effort to be put into the actual entertaining aspect of the comedy while also keeping you relaxed. You certainly won't have to scratch your head while watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have what I believe to be the greatest asset Non Non Biyori has. The characters. 5 girls all from different ages, each with their own quirky personality and traits that offer the viewer a vast range of prespectives as opposed to having a character set with people in the same grade. First we have Hotaru, a fifth grade student that came from the city. Not used to the country lifestyle Hotaru will try and learn everything she can to enjoy her new life in the countryside while enjoying her life as a student and of course having her characteristic obsession with her senior Komari. We then have the Koshigaya sisters. Natsumi being the more outgoing and loud type of character who is always trying to cause trouble, and Komari, the senior that tries to show her authority but fails miserably due to her small stature. And last but not least, perhaps a fan favorite, there is Renge a first grader with the habit to do whatever she wants and try to learn from everyone at the same time in her own cute little way. Watching all these different aged characters form bonds and do a lot of activities together is what Non Non Biyori is all about and the thing that will not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nBut not only are the main characters strong, the side characters are al very original and have indivituality and traits that make you remember them as well. This is something plenty of series lack where they just ditch a side character after they appear for one or two episodes. There's the local candy store owner, nickname Candy Store. There's the school's teacher that's more of a slacker than anything else. And one of my personal favorites the last of the Koshigaya siblings Suguru who by not uttering a single word can be one of the most entertaining. These small aspect are in fact a big deal in these kind of series and I'm so glad they were not left out.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that's worth mentioning is the art. I can not stress out how many beautiful sceneries there are in this show. Every single episodes seems to use new backgrounds for a wide panoply of colors and feelings. You as the viewer will be transported into the countryside with all the bright colors and amazing landscapes which, as simple as they are, have their charm and make this show much more simple and light hearted as opposed to typical high school settings in a crowded city. \\n\\n\r\nNanairo Biyori, the opening theme for the show is great to set the mood. Whenever I watch an episode I always listen carefully to the opening theme and watch the senquence, I know instantly that what's coming up will put a smile on my face. And then the ending theme Non Non Biyori which seems more like a song you'd put on in order to fall asleep bids you farewell still in a relaxing manner. The overall sounds during the show are not overused or repetitive. Aside from the typical cicadas and the sun glowing as the wind waves the grass around everything feels like a proper life in the country where there's no excessive ruckus.\\n\\n\r\nI could fanboy a lot about this show but I think you should take a look for yourself. My enjoyment of this series is sky high. I watch it often at night after getting all worked up during the day and no matter what happens I know this will bring a smile to my face and make me forget my worries. This is slice of life for everyone to enjoy with its minimalistic yet effective attitude.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Non Non Biyori is this 2013 fall's slice of life gem. Simple and relaxing. Great cast with quirky but effective humor. A lot of individuality from each character, never leaving out side characters and yet always adding something new to the mixture. These 5 elementary and middle school girls will keep you cheering for them as they go through both hardships and cheerful moments together. If you are a slice of life fan for its simplicity. Non Non Biyori is a show that should not be dismissed as it offers great potential and I am thankful that anime like these are produced to date.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, you come across a show that seems very plain, boring, and not worth the time. You read the synopsis and it still doesn't draw you in. However, you give it a shot. Non Non Biyori was a show that fit this description on the surface, but taking the chance on it was well worth it. In fact, its simplicity was the major strength of the show and Non Non Biyori was by far my favorite show of the season.\r\nThe story itself is rather basic, as are most slice of life shows. It follows a group of four young ladies (aged7, 10, 13, and 14 approximately) and their lives in the Japanese countryside. Away from the life in the big city of Tokyo, Hotaru Ichijo (age 10) must adapt to a more simpler way of life and assimilate into the community. The episode titles are quite vague and the series follows a more episodic sequence complete with shorts within an episode. Even as it jumps along, the story is easy to understand, and more importantly, to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of Non Non Biyori is the art style. Being set in the Japanese countryside, a lot of detail rests within the landscape. The background settings are lush with vibrant greens, blues, and pinks. It's a beautiful setting. Within this setting are homes with a dull brown colors (aside from Hotaru's higher end home which is a nice white with colored accents). The school is a run-down shack that is made completely of wood. The character designs are succinct and well executed. The colors of Komari and Natsumi Koshigaya's school uniforms are a very bland scheme of tan and dark blue. The very colorful backgrounds couple with the dull houses and clothing creates a very stark color contrast which is easy on the eyes. The show is beautiful and pleasing to look at. Viewers receive an added bonus during the end cards where a photo of the real-life Japanese countryside are shown. It is a part of Japan life and culture not commonly conveyed in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, sound effects, and voice cast is also well done. Right from the get-go you get a reoccurring OST along with Renge Miyauchi (age 7) providing an off tune accompaniment on recorder. It's a rather basic melody and sets the tone for the entire show. The openings and endings have a playful feel. The background effects provide a comforting feel. They display a serene and peaceful environment that is very different than shows set in the city or in large schools. Where I am most impressed is the ability of grown adult women being able to provide voices to children and do it effectively. Renge's voice is the most impressive. Being 7 years old, her voice actor is able to capture a very juvenile tone. The show loses points for not having Nii-chan, Sugaru Koshigaya, speak once (just kidding).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well done and they all have very distinguishable traits. Starting from the oldest, Komari Koshigaya is a 14 year old girl who is just starting to enter womanhood. However, she is very short and has stunted development which causes her grief. Natsumi Koshigaya is a 13 year old girl who is Komari's little sister. However, she is already taller than her sister which irritates Komari. She is tomboyish and athletic, but not very good at school and is always getting into trouble. Hotaru Ichijo is the main protagonist and is a 10 year old transfer from Tokyo. She is rather wealthy and is well developed for someone her age. She looks up to Komari, her senpai, and admires her in an almost obsessive way. Renge Miyauchi is an eccentric 7 year old who has an understandably childish outlook. She provides a lot of the show's comedy with her mannerisms and preferences. Despite her age, she melds well with the older girls. The supporting cast provides a nice community effect and rounds out the show in a nice way.\\n\\n\r\nWhat sets this show apart from other shows is its simplicity. It's easy to follow because there is no complex plot or unanswered questions. What you see is what you get, which is extremely refreshing. There is a warm friendship among the four main characters that is very uplifting. As an adult male, I was not sure how I would relate to a show focused on elementary and middle school girls, but the show resonated with me because their daily lives were so realistic that it draws you into the show. Where this show fails, is it's tendency to drift into the mainstream anime scene, most notably the unnecessary fan-service. I feel like that has no place in this show, especially with a group of characters aged so young. Even so, what little fan-service was present in this show did not detract from the enjoyment of Non Non Biyori. I highly recommend it as a departure from the norm that exists in today's anime.",

I'd be lying if I said this anime didn't make me feel warm and happy inside, because that's exactly what it did. The whole setting is very nostalgic, there isn't a whole lot of story if that's what your into, though the creators do make an effort to keep it interesting.\r\nIt's definitely worth the watch, I'm hoping I can say the same about the second season as well.",

            "content": "Insert compulsory Nyanpasu here.\r\nSometimes it's good to just relax from all the stress and enjoy the little things in life that at first may not seem like much, but will be the things you miss the most when you cant do them anymore.\r\nNon Non Biyori is possibly the most calming, therapeutic and entertaining slices of life, around today. Nothing abnormal, nothing over ridiculous, no meaning to each episode or conceivable plot line and yet each episode leaves you yearning for what will happen next. From a distant summary of each episode nothing seems overly interesting however it takes that and makes each and every episodeinto something that awakens your younger memories, inner child and sense of relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art right from the get go is staggering. A little bright in some cases but can easily been seen that an immense amount of effort went into making each and every scene look as utterly beautiful as it is. However while the scenery is mind blowing good, it does make the animated characters stand out multiple times, occasionally looking out of place with the art.\\n\\n\r\nMusic, sound, voices. You name it, its done almost perfectly in this anime. The mix of the characters, scenery, music and everyday tasks that happen in the anime all seem to blend together in a way that takes you back when you were in primary school and is a rather joyful feeling. To the point where you don't even want to skip the intro because it just installs that feeling of blissful relaxation into you. Once you get used to the lyrics sounding like they were sung by a 14 year old holding their nose... (Personal note, I had the ending theme playing on repeat while writing this)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for the most cases could not be more relate-able. from boring school life, to weekend chores. Even the feeling of it being the end of the world when you're 7 years old and your friend moves away. Apart from the occasional over exaggerated dialogue scene, nothing is anything different from what you'd call \"The norm.\" Character Development is fairly panned out thing as you steadily learn more about the characters through everyday things that happen in each ep as they all treat each other as long time friends from the beginning. The only thing that was questionable was the lack of male voices. It was utterly shocking when the first male line was spoken... late in the season... Despite the fact there being at least one male character there the entire time (Nicknamed under appreciated Glasses-Kun)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was never a dull moment. The first episode establishes the calm environment that the anime is and from there it just plays on the extremely average slice of life to the point where eventually you find yourself laughing at scenes that really should not be funny, but for some reason they just are and you can't explain it. If you don't have kids, this anime will bring out your inner child. If you do have kids, you'll find this odd but amusingly adorable. Both all the while feeling reminiscent or nostalgic.",

Non Non Biyori is episodic in nature and it does not have an overarching  story to to tie the episodes together in fact the only reason what the episodes are related isbecause are the adventure and happenings the the group of girls experience during the course of one year. But this is to be expected in a series of the slice of life genre so for the genre it's pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10 \\n\r\nThe music is amazing the op and ed fit  the mood of the series so perfectly something that sometimes doesn't happen. Also the BGM is quite nice in my opinion and also suit the series perfectly\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10\\n\r\nThe character are the strongest point of the show by far. They are the ones the push the story forward. Foe me they are amazing and are developed in a nice way they all feel believable and I came to love them over the course of the series. I don\u00b4t want to go into detail detail because I feel they are something that you have to experience for yourself and I don't want to spoil anything about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nThe art for Non Non Biyori is amazing. It is consistent throughout all the series and never drops at any point during the duration of it. Also the style compliments perfectly the setting and the overall atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nFrom reading the rest of my review I bet you can tel how much I loved this series. For me watching this series was a very relaxing experience that I have never experience in another series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nFor me this series is pretty much perfect and it a must watch series for everyone that loves the slice of life genre. But I also think you should give it a try even if you don't like the slice of life genre that much because it is that amazing of a series.",

            "content": "A show about cute girls doing cute things packs its bags, leaves the high school and takes the bus out to the countryside.\r\nNon Non Biyori is another entry into the popular Slice of Life genre and proves how competent and aware it is of its own strengths right from the very first episode. The entire anime evokes feelings of calm and \"Natsukashii\" with its inherent familiarity and warmth, from the music to the characters, but not least the art, background design and scenery. Taking place far away from the city, Non Non Biyori replaces classrooms, hallways and sidewalks for a criminally underused rural setting thatfeels like a welcome change and a chance to relax. Long, stretching roads flanked by rice fields, big country homes and green, vibrant mountains are all present as the main cast spends their days with activities that would be foreign to any other SoL cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of this kind of approach would probably be Aria, with its focus on beautiful scenery and a laid back attitude that NNB shares, except here the focus was likely to bring out the beauty through its simple but realistic style. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing makes full use of the setting and invents scenes and scenarios that are common, but out in the country things are done a bit differently. It might take a bit longer and it might not be as convenient, but who knows what might happen along the way. Even something as easy as going to the candy store becomes a long bus-trip where anything could happen, and when the characters arrive they talk to the owner as they were all friends. Moments like this wouldn't happen otherwise. Too many people and you'll feel lonely, but here there is a small community of friends and acquaintances that are brought together through work and play.\\n\\n\r\nWatching NNB is like forgetting where you are for just 20 minutes and just letting yourself be carried into a friendly world without modern technology and what comes with it, which is the appeal oh this healing SoL comedy.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is an excellent SoL that offers something that few do and it deserves a watch by anyone willing to experiment with the old Seinfeld idea of a show about nothing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs it yuri?\\n\\n\r\nHotaru definitely has a crush on her smaller elder, Komari, which pushes her to her absolute limits and is often the subject of a joke or two. What would you be willing to do for your chibi senpai?\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat eurobeat song would this be?\\n\\n\r\nJilly - Fly. Bright, cheery and floaty with enough carefree attitude to bring a smile to anyone's face.\\n",

            "content": "Non Non Biyori is one of the most simple but most effective and beautiful anime I have seen. I don't usually enjoy slice of life shows that much due to the lack of plot. However, Non Non Biyori really drew me in regardless thanks to its absolutely amazing atmosphere, which was complimented by its gorgeous art and animation.\r\nThe story, such as it is, is about the peaceful lives of the residents of Asahigaoka, focusing on the five students (or four + the brother, who is a mute, light comic character) at the only school in town, in the only class in the school. This animeis unique because of how it chooses to be a portrayal of very rural life. This is a town where there are only five students in the entire school. Everyone knows each other and inherently trust each other. The way the countryside is portrayed in Non Non Biyori is not mere fiction; though it is not as common as it once was, there are still communities like this. Having grown up in an area somewhat similar to Asahigaoka, I can attest to this fact! That may be part of why I was so taken with this anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nA major theme in the anime is an appreciation for simplicity and the beauty of nature. The opening sequence of the first episode is perhaps the anime's best example of this and, if you're like me, you will be spellbound by the atmosphere immediately. A large part of what makes the atmosphere so good is the level of detail in the art. It is exceptionally detailed, with beautiful use of shadows and rippling waters. The balance of light and dark is incredible. This is hands down the most detailed art I have seen in an anime. The animation goes hand in hand with the art, being exceptionally smooth. The music is tranquil and casual, and silly at times for comedic scenes. Though not as good as the art, it is also excellent.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all loveable in their own way. Some of the character concepts are slightly unoriginal, but there are no obvious archetypes here. They each have their own quirks, and it's enjoyable to watch how they respond to various situations in their own unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nOne complaint I do have is that the last episode ended a bit abruptly. I was expecting one more scene, but it never came. Although, as a slice of life anime, there is no central plot to conclude, so these sorts of anime usually do end without much of a conclusion. However, Non Non Biyori felt a little extra inconclusive. But since there is a second season, I hope that by continuing to watch the show, the damage from the first season's lack of a satisfying conclusion will be mitigated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Non Non Biyori is an excellent slice of life anime, and I recommend it not just to fans of slice of life, but also to those who may usually find slice of life boring, but who also appreciate art, music, and atmosphere in the anime that they do watch.",

Non Non Biyori is the source of that golden sunlight, an energy giving you many hearty smiles and feelings of happiness. Let's follow this warmth towards a fun life in a fresh rural setting!\r\nYay, looks like you've arrived! Welcome to Asahigaoka, a lush countryside located away from the towering structures of a city. Can you feel its beautiful freedom? This is truly the place where leisure entertains the ordinary youngsters who livehere in the most simplistic and delightful ways. Sure, it might not be unique, but there's no guaranteed rule that states how uniqueness will always lead to the best enjoyment. That's what makes this exceptional. It infuses easy, straightforward, and uncomplicated - all these words describing a basic essence - with a special quality. We get to see the playful attitudes of their youthful lives. With enjoyment ticking every second, this happy cycle continues on and on throughout the seasons of the year.

It's a clean environment with no stressful chaos in sight. Just walk around for a bit. Soon enough, your hearing sense will take in everything that this place can acoustically produce. The gleeful talks from the girls emit out a lot of heart-melting love. Sceneries are lifted by harmonizing soundtracks as wind instruments blow gently into the air. With the bell-like and woody tone, this cordial melody meditates with calmness. There's no calamity and pure softness is all it takes to let the most genuine emotions out. Combining these aspects together give Asahigaoka an enchanting ambience to unwind any strained tension. More than that, there is also a beauty found during those moments when the residents stroll about, minding their own business with a beautiful and vast scenery in the background. They might only be a young speck in a huge world, but their personality together is just as big as the planet itself. This is a juxtaposition between the young and the aged world. It really is a wonderful contrast, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nLife may be a slow-paced existence within a rural scope but there's no need to rush through it. Feel the gentle breeze, breathe the positive air, stir the glassy stream. Nature is a beautiful entertainment in itself, and Non Non Biyori is an example of the things it can provide to us as its habitants. What an entertaining relaxation.",

            "content": "I will try to keep this review from being too long because this anime is like 4 Y/O now and not many people will read it anyway so to start : SPOILER ALERT.\r\nI love the slice of life genre, it's definitely one of my favorite genres because it helps me relax and enjoy watching relatable, funny and new experiences and adventures, The most important thing in this genre is how good the characters are and how well-written they are so i'll just discuss that point and end it at that. \r\nThis anime is very relaxing i have to say but the characters were weird, idon't remember seeing most of the main characters in a slice of life anime that feel so empty, the side characters are way better than them and they are more relatable and fun to watch, for example: \\n\r\nHotaru is the new girl who just transferred and it looked normal at first but starting from episode 2, her character fell to the ground, Hotaru likes Komari (which i'm not sure if it's actual love like yuri love or just likes her because she is cute and small and i really hope it is the latter), that's it, that's all she has going for her, all episodes include her doing one of these things : thinking about Komari, making dolls that look like Komari or just goes out to meet her, the way she is set makes me think that she doesn't care for anyone else other than Komari and i'm sure the author relaised that and that's why he wrote the scene at the end of episode 12 to try to make her look like the caring girl who loves all but that's just not how she is , also she is 11 years old but the way she acts makes me forget that and i sometimes think that if she was a 15 Y/O it would have been perfect other than just stating that she is 11 for the laughs and struggling to make a personality that fits her.\\n\\n\r\nRenge is the youngest out of all of the characters and is probably the best well-written in the anime, you could tell that her mindset is that of a child yet she is still interesting to watch when she's talking with her friends and behaving in a very simple yet cute manner, she talks in a childish way yet has a mature mindset at the same time, her personality fits her perfectly and makes you think about how hard the author worked on creating her, she was the main reason i finished the first season.\\n\\n\r\nKomari is the 14 Y/O girl who the author still struggled to create a fitting personality for, her body being small doesn't mean that she should act like a 9 Y/O , the way she talks and thinks is not fitting at all, if the author just switched the ages between her and Hotaru it would have been better instead of just ruining 2 characters to make a joke or 2 about their bodies, her behaviors, way of thinking and her normal talking with anyone makes me think that she is just thrown out there because the author didn't know how to create a personality for Hotaru so she was like a bait or an easy way out of that problem.\\n\\n\r\nNatsumi is komari's younger sister with a fitting personality and enjoyable behaviors and overall she is a good character.\\n\\n\r\nSuguru IDK why he is part of the anime tbh, if you take him out the only 2 things that would change are the ending of episode 12 where he sees renge and she runs away, the other thing is the ending of some other episode where Natsumi said she wanted to marry him, that's all, useless character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Last Character i'll talk about is Kaede who is the 2nd reason i continued this season tbh, she has a beautiful personality, she is caring, sweet, lovable and very kind specially towards renge and both of them talking and interacting with each other just makes the episode way more enjoyable, if the 2 of them were the main characters with Natsumi, i'm sure this would have been much better. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is good and all but those were the problems i saw in the characters and that was my opinion, just wanted to make that clear.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating 7/10.\\n\r\nWould Probably recommend it.",

            "content": "Ufff, what can I say about this anime?\r\nOk, let's start.\r\nNon Non Biyori is an humanistic history.\r\nIsn't the traditional Slice of Life series, this is so much than other series with same genre.\r\nThe story that tells us is so simple and does not get complicated at any time: girls living her life, day by day.\r\nBut, what is the difference between this anime and another Slice of Slife series?\r\nI said it at the beginning! It's an humanistic story.\r\nAll the main characters are children under the \"adolescence age\", with minimalist problems, like the height (Komari), the fun (Natsumi) or discover the world (Renge), problems that we have whenwe are less than 15 years old.\\n\\n\r\nLife in a rural community makes girls ignorant of the problems that exist in an urban society, which makes them happy for the small moments they live together, problems like love, money, popularity, all of these, doesnt' exist here, only the humility of each.\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is humanistic because each character behaves according to her age. Komari wants to be taller than Natsumi because she is the older sister and she wants to be more feminine. Natsumi only wants fun, and she's always making mistakes, but then she accepts that she failed, and Renge is discovering new emotions, adventures, wants to discover the world.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, Hotaru, she is the point and apart of the story.\\n\r\nShe comes from the city, she comes from a different life, and she contrasts with the other characters, since she has a different vision of life.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I love from Hotaru, is her personality. unlike the others, she behaves differently with her friends and in her home. being this behavior, something normal of a city person.\\n\r\nAs a functional person in society, you often have to maintain a different profile with your friends, family and co-workers, and this is what Hotaru's character transmits.\\n\r\nThis is different with the other girls, who behave the same both at home and in groups, there is no social pressure that leads them to change their personality in different scenarios.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo finish, the anime will not introduce unnecessary ecchi or fanservice scenes, since it respects you as an observer, only you, the characters, and the context: the field.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the magic of Non Non Biyori.",

            "content": "You know what would be funny? If the little village turned out to be Hinamizawa.\r\nStory:\r\nNon Non Biyori is about the life of the only five students of the school in a really tiny rural village somewhere in Japan. Hotaru just moved here from Tokyo and learns about life far from the big city. I could tell you about how this anime is about nothing at all and just there to make you feel relaxed and yadda yadda yadda, but this show actually tells us a story. The story of discovering the small things in life and what is really important. Sure, living in a bigcity makes life a lot easier, but does it make life more fun? Spoiler: no. There are two things that make your life fun (at least that is what I believe in): creating memorable experiences and sharing them with people you care about. I grew up in an area that was somewhere between suburban and rural, so I can somewhat relate to the experiences these kids make. Going outside, not doing anything in particular but doing it with your friends, that\u2019s what makes these characters happy. For everybody growing up in a similar landscape, Non Non Biyori is a nice nostalgic trip, for everybody else, it can be a good example of how precious life can truly be. Okay, I\u2019m starting to sound like your Hippy English teacher, sorry for that. To get to the point, this anime is about growing up in the countryside and enjoying it and it does a fantastic job.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWell, if you\u2019ve watched your share of slice of life comedies, you know what to expect from Non Non Biyori. I can\u2019t say the character design is very creative, but as I said numerous times before, for this kind of anime it isn\u2019t necessary to do more. It might even be better to not do it, since they go hand in hand with the comedy. The scenery is very beautiful, we get to see the beauty of nature, often enough in great detail. It gives you a feeling of being there. Some criticism however goes to the animation. There were a couple of occasions when the characters seemed to be walking on air or something, making it painfully obvious that they were added on later. This can seriously hurt the suspension of disbelief and distracts you. Thankfully those things didn\u2019t happen too often.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song is very catchy and it radiates the calmness of the show well. The same goes for the ending, which is made in a similar style, but even more relaxed. The voice acting was all around solid, no outliers (oh god, I hope this is the correct word) in any direction\u2026with one little exception. Kotori Koiwai does a brilliant job as Renge. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I would bet that she was voiced by an actual child. Impressive job there. Another well done thing were the background noises, you know, the wind or the cicadas, all that stuff. Really nice.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWe have four main characters, so let\u2019s take a look at each of them. Hotaru is the new girl, who is somewhat like a reverse Yotsuba. She discovers the wonders of living in a small village with the amazement of a child (which she is, even though she seems to behave rather mature for her age most of the time). Her obsession with Koma was a little forced, but I can accept things like that for the sake of comedic effect. Speaking of Koma, she is the butt monkey of the cast. Even though she\u2019s the oldest of the four girls, she is impressively short and the more she tries to act like an adult, the more childish she appears. I wasn\u2019t much into her as a character, but she did her job as target for many jokes, so that\u2019s okay. Her little sister Natsumi was a bit more interesting. She\u2019s a tomboy with a very bad personality problem. While being a terrible child and constantly making fun of her sister, she is not a bad person. She doesn\u2019t want to make life hard for anyone, she just wants to make it easier for herself. She is a brat, plain and simple. Last, but not least, we have Renge. Renge is an adorable child, who has the wild imagination only children her age seem to possess. But on top of that, she does not seem to express any feelings with her face, even when being excited by anything. The only times we see something else than her signature frown is when she is crying (which is really, really heartbreaking). She also tries her best to make snarky comments, but they always end up just sounding very random. Maybe that\u2019s because she hangs around with girls much older than herself? Anyway, it\u2019s easy to see why she is everybody\u2019s favourite characters, she is just a lot of fun and really, really cute. Out of the side cast I liked the candy store owner, who is somewhat of a grouch (except when it comes to Renge) and the completely irresponsible teacher. All in all, the cast was pretty entertaining, not much to write an essay about, but enough to be relatable and likeable.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAfter watching Usagi Drop, I found out that I am a big fan of Iyashikei anime (you know, the healing type stuff). Non Non Biyori ranks pretty high on the list of these shows one should have seen. If you desire something lighthearted and some solid comedy (though not a gag storm), this anime is a good choice. I enjoyed the nostalgia and the calmness, while also laughing at most of the jokes. I don\u2019t know what took me so long to pick this one up, but I\u2019m glad I did and I already look forward to Repeat, though I have no idea when I\u2019ll get around to actually watching it.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.6/10\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s all for today!",

            "content": "The escape to the countryside!\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\r\nAfter watching Non Non Biyori (NNB), it was very reminiscent for me because my grandparents live on the countryside back in Korea. As a youngster that visited the countryside, I hated the fact that there was a lack of technology. I hated the fact that you have to dig a hole in order to use the restroom. I hated that there were chickens in the backyard. I hated how the next gas station or the nearest marketplace was 10 miles away. Now that I'm grown, I've forgotten the beauty of the hills and the mountains. I've forgotten drinking fresh, coldspring water that flowed out of a small crevice beside the roads. I've forgotten swimming in the lakes and catching fish in the rivers. Non Non Biyori took me right back. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY (6/10):\\n\r\nThe story mainly focuses on Hotaru Ichijo, a city girl who had recently moved to the countryside. Hoping to assimilate into the foreign environment, she becomes involved with three other girls that live there and creates childhood memories with them. It's quite a simple storyline. The low score doesn't negatively affect the viewers because it's a \"slice of life\" genre, so don't think I'm fooling you. Although the storyline is lacking, NNB draws the viewers away from the busy, fast life of a city commoner and places them in a peaceful environment where you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy some moe moments.\\n\\n\r\nART (9/10):\\n\r\nEcstatic, fluid, colorful. Natural. There is rarely any CGIs in NNB and the viewers are given plenty of pleasant scenery of the countryside. The producers definitely wanted to bring the viewers in the moment. Like all \"slice of life\" genres, the seasonal change is most definitely the turning points of the characters in the anime, as they grow throughout the seasons. The art is ultimately NNB's strong-point and the pillar of the anime. From the smallest details, the background is splashed with color and mirrors the reality of nature, which is both astounding and mesmerizing. Just sitting back and watching the scenes in this anime made me want to travel back to the countryside.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10):\\n\r\n\"Nanairo Biyori\" by Nano Ripe is the OP and the trajectory into the beautiful scenes that NNB benevolently provides the viewers with. With a melodic, hypnotizing tune, the song gets the viewers into the \"mood\". \"Non Non Biyori\" is sung by the characters in the anime, and the EP that concludes the episodes. The melody really plucks heartstrings as the animation behind the song moves with the anime. Both songs are not bad, but they did not really leave a big impression on me, like the artistic value.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (8/10):\\n\r\nThe characters brings the anime to life. Too much nature would be boring, so the producers cleverly inputted cute lolis, giving each of them unique personalities that rivals the gratifying animation and background art. From the youngest to oldest, we have Renge Miyauchi, who adores viewers with her imagination and personality. Hotaru Ichijo, the freshest member of the four girls and usually the straight-man, as she attempts to wiggle her way into her strange surroundings and friends. Natsumi Koshigaya, the tomboyish figure and also the comedy relief and finally Komari Koshigaya, the older sister to Natusmi, Hotaru's psuedo-yuri love interest, and the victim to many of the jokes in NNB, as she is the oldest girl in the group yet the shortest, next to Renge. With all of their personalities combined, the ordinary life of a countryside girl becomes a wonderland, full of fun imagination and simple life lessons. In addition, the supporting characters are not shadowed by the main characters and each have their own interesting personalities that the viewers may enjoy. The only character that I wished the producers would have worked on more is the oldest of the Koshigaya siblings, Suguru. His involvement in the anime is barely noticeable and is the silent figure that quietly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10):\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, NNB brings soliloquy and a positive atmosphere to the round table of the \"slice of life\" genre. The countryside is a rare scenario that many animes do not focus on, but NNB clearly displays the life of a countryside citizen, and proves that it can be fun and beautiful at the same time. I felt as if NNB was a metaphorical journey to the countryside, a short break from all the intense, dramatic, romantic moments in \"slice of life\". Sometimes, you just have to get away and I'm glad that NNB is available for those that need it.",

            "content": "Ah, Non Non Biyori. Very much a guilty pleasure for me - I can honestly say it's one of the loveliest 12 episodes I have spent watching anime. I'm not usually a fan of true slice of life anime- I get tired of them easily as usually the story is mediocre and there's no real drive to the plot.\r\nThe story is really very simple - Hotaru moves into the country, and joins a school which only has 4 other members. The anime looks at their daily lives and activities together. It may sound boring, but it is very well done. There are many humorous momentsthroughout the show. This anime doesn't pretend to be something it's not (I'm looking at you, Clannad), instead it focuses on creating an adorable, enjoyable show which almost anyone will enjoy,. I found it very soothing, from the slow pace of the writing to the way everything is depicted, to the fun humour.\\n\\n\r\nThe art gets a 9 from me. I loved the beautiful country scenes, and each of the characters was easily definable from the others without being too \"weird\", which I find is a mistake many anime make in order to attempt to make characters \"different\".\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also merits a 9 - I enjoyed the OP and the ED and thought they fit well with the theme of the show (the OP was relatively cutesy, which fit well with the relatively cutesy nature of the anime), and the ED was memorable. There was no character whose voice annoyed me, and the voices all sounded like they belonged to the correct age group. Supposed teenagers in anime who sound like 5-year-olds are a pet hate of mine.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most engaging points of this anime for me was the characters. Not one of them was annoying, or illogical, and you could really believe their characters could be real people. The story revolves around the characters of Hotaru, sisters Natsumi and Komari and Renge. All four of these characters have their own, very unique characteristics and personalities, none of which are your typical anime stereotypes, which was refreshing and made the show ever more pleasurable to watch. The supporting cast was strong, too - like the main cast, they all had believable characters, and none of them was unlike-able. Overall, I gave this category a 9 - a strong cast of memorable personalities and characters which broke the mould. My personal favourite was Renge - I found her the most intriguing personality (not being your stereotpical cutesy little girl).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, enjoyment gets a straight 10 - there were no points in this anime where I felt bored, sad, or annoyed. Non Non Biyori is a real triumph of a slice of life anime in my opinion, boasting a great character line-up, some really beautiful art and an engaging if simple concept/story. It is a great anime to watch if you need cheering up - I shall be keeping it on hand in case I ever need a pick-me-up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Non Non Biyori a 9. A memorable, most enjoyable anime, which I will not hesitate to pick up again in the future.",

The side characters are also enjoyable, but they don't really go through anything very special. There are 25 episodes in total including the 2nd season (Non Non Biyori Repeat) and OVA. The intro and the outro are catchy, but the outro sounds more for a younger audience\r\n The art and scenery is beautiful and the sounds are in sync.\r\n There isn't really a set story just adventures the girls have.\r\n Overall it's avery relaxing and enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\njust don't let anyone see your watching it, especially if your a male like me.",

It's a pure and innocent show that makes it perfect for family viewing and can often be inspiring, making you want to rediscover your connection with nature and grab your childhood by the horns.\r\nThe series has no particular plot, it jumps around the year, moving with the seasons.  It beautifully displays the four seasons and creates the nostalgic feelings we often experience, even more so as we watch thecharacters enjoy each season to its fullest, from jumping into rivers to making igloos.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters are lovable as you quickly get to know them in each episode, learning more and more about them.  Watching the four girls play and discover never becomes boring.  They do simple, everyday things, but their personalities and relationships with each other make even the most normal tasks enjoyable to watch.  The humor is very lighthearted, it's almost impossible to not smile throughout each episode.  \\n\\n\r\nI really can't say anything bad about Non Non Biyori.  For me, it was the perfect anime.  I can watch alone, with my family, over and over.  I fell in love with it, with it's characters, and it's setting almost instantly.  Whenever someone asks for a recommendation for a slice of life anime, I ALWAYS mention Non Non Biyori.  If you want a relaxing, enjoyable, nostalgic and entertaining show, this is where it' at.",

            "content": "-Story-\r\n As expected from a Iyashikei slice of life school anime, the episodes focus on the mundane activities of daily school life (in this case, as in many, of some cute girls' school life). This anime follows the trope of a character moving from the big city to the countryside (where everything is calmer and everyone knows each other). \r\nSome episodes were unique due to the setting (farming and animal keeping episodes), but we also have the typical S.L stuff (beach and festival episodes). The Iyashikei aspect and the stories were well explored, in the sense that every episode is enjoyable for its cuteness andcalmness.          \\n\r\nWith that said, the calmness might be the strongest and weakest point of this show, because it's really great when you're stressed, but somewhat too slow paced when you aren't in the mood.\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\r\nThe textures; backgrounds; character designs and colors look really good and helped to capture the calm mood of the work.\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe OST is really calming and cheerful, perfectly fitting with the situations and with some songs better than others, but a very good overall\\n\r\nThe OP is ok, but the ED is amazing. It\u2019s sung by the own characters (which is always a plus for me) and fits nicely with the ''all is calm and chill\u2019\u2019 and the ''that\u2019s all for today\u2019\u2019 ideas.\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\n The main characters were all enjoyable, having in mind that they were representing characteristics and tropes (the sleepy one, the energetic irresponsible and so on). But some are more fleshed and have more facets. With that said there\u2019s some character development, but not much (as expected from a slice of life).\\n\r\n I should mention that Suguru was a wasted character with a lot of potential. He was used as one of those mute and do nothing characters, despite being in a very interesting spot for cool stories, which is being the only male in the entire school. \\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a very soothing and cute show. The humor is sometimes powerful and makes you really laugh and we have some cool stories that resemble situations a lot of people lived. With that said, I believe even non anime fans will enjoy this show\\n",

            "content": "Hey guys! For those of you unfamiliar with how I do things, briefly:\r\n- Categories are weighted differently\r\n- Story-driven anime (like One Piece) and episodic anime (like Nichijou) are critiqued differently\r\n- For reviews, I give my critical rating, not my personal rating; it'd be too bias.\r\n- If you don't care for long reviews, I put the overall rating at the bottom.\r\nAlright, let's get started!\r\nCritique Rating Type: Episodic; no overarching storyline\r\nThis review includes both seasons of the anime and contains NO SPOILERS\r\nCharacter Development - 9 (60%): This anime does an excellent job showing how the characters grew during the one-year time frame the anime has. Each characterhas some explanation of some of the reasons why they behave the way they do, as well as providing background information on characters when the conflict and solution of the episode called for it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime does a good job portraying its characters and the reasons for their growth/what their growth means to them and to the other characters. Character interactions also seem reasonable, providing excellent scenes that are memorable to fans of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the character development aspect of this anime receives a beautiful score of \u201c9\u201d; some aspects could be worked on, but for the most part, the characters are well grounded.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRepresentation/presentation of the genres and tropes provided and explored - 10 (25%): The anime is mostly a Slice of Life and Comedy. These two genres are expertly crafted alongside the theme of living in the Japanese countryside where little happens and stores are far away. With such little population around the characters, the setting gives us an amazing representation of kids being kids.\\n\\n\r\nWith so much nature around and with such a small school, the main characters rely on each other and their environment for entertainment which provides some unique circumstances relative to other Slice of Life anime. The characters are well depicted in this environment and provide an interesting perspective of a Slice of Life; the anime cannot be any more of a Slice of Life than it already is!\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the representation of the Comedy and Slice of Life aspects of the anime receive an astounding \u201c10!\u201d; the way the anime represents Slice of Life is basically perfect. A few things might be too much for some people, but overall very well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPacing - 8 (10%): This is a very divided category for the anime community. Because of the nature of the anime, some might say that the pacing of this anime is too slow. As much I would agree with them, in this case, I have to disagree.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the anime represents a Slice of Life situation in the countryside, the slow pacing of the anime complements itself very well as the slow pacing is defined by the \"slow-paced\u201d lifestyle that these characters live.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime picks up the pace, however, it has a much more powerful impact as the faster pacing would indicate chaos or disorder in the events that are occurring and thus, providing a rush when the anime quickens and a relief when it slows back down as conflicts are solved.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the pacing aspect of this anime receives a respectable \u201c8\u201d; out of respect to those who might call this anime slow, I thought an 8 would be fair to both fans of the series and those who believe it to be too slow. Everyone\u2019s different and there is no anime that everyone can agree on as the best series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPopularity and relevance towards the time period it was made in/made for - 6 (5%): This anime seems to have moderate popularity which has increased somewhat when the second season was announced.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the recent relevancy of the anime, it seems to be somewhat underrated, but that might change as the manga continues to publish more volumes, giving the anime more material to be able to air a possible third season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for the rating of this category, the popularity aspect of this anime receives a bit of a hurtful \u201c6\u201d; should the anime receive a third season, this anime could enter more anime lists by the community.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\n(9 * 0.6) + (10* 0.25) + (8 * 0.1) + (6 * 0.05) = CR\\n\r\n5.4 + 2.5 + 0.8 + 0.3 = 9\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! I hope you have a nice day!",

The story is plain and simple but the way the characters go through it makes it just awesome. It has such a cliche into, but they smash it to pieces when they show the amount of people in the class room and how the teacher is just... sleeping. Then it just goes through a year though out the season with some funny episodes every once in a while, like episode 7... I love it. You should watchit to, it really not funny at all, totally serious right now so don't even consider me lying*cough*.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty simple and yet some how different. They all live in a small community and try to compare it to Tokyo, just because. Their families actually get  screen time and play a role in the story... even if just a little bit. Some of the main characters  are good old fashioned try hards in school while one is a procrastinator... which doesn't resemble anyone writing this comment one bit *cough*... and another is just a good student. they all have their moments of fun with each other and will make you laugh at LEAST a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nSo yah, I really enjoyed this anime so you should watch it, but only if you like slow paced anime that really doesn't have a focused story or plain as hell slice of life ( which is the best kind, personal opinion just so you know).",

Upon pursuing watching this anime per the recommendations of another fellow MAL user, I was quickly gripped by this anime. If you're looking for an action packed brawler anime, this one's not for you. But if you're looking for a stress free and heart warming anime that follows the simple things in life, then this is an anime for you. I've laughed aloud, I've smiled, I've cried at happy points and at sad points. Thisis one of few anime I confidently stand by the belief is without any flaw to it. From the beautiful art, the tranquil and mood appropriate music to the heart warming dialogue of characters, this anime has my heart gushing with warm emotions and I strongly recommend this anime to anyone looking for an anime that speaks to the heart.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate:\\n\\n\r\nSince I've finished this series, I can now give my own comprehensive review of the series:\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing all 12 episodes, I can safely say my opinion of the series has not dropped, a flawless ten all the way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story overall is wonderful and simple. There's no attempts at complex story hooks instead favouring emotional tie ins and expands on characters lives. Without writing spoilers, the episodes are fairly self-contained and can be watched independently.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is simply awe inspiring. The characters are well written and scenery is so beautifully drawn and coloured in it really left a sense of warmth in my heart when queued with the OST of Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voices, sound effects and music are really what builds this anime. The voices are all unique and distinctive, the sound effects like the locusts chirping in the background really sets a feeling of oneness with yourself when watching it. This is only strengthened by the very appropriate soundtrack from gentle piano, sweet recorder music or upbeat tracks in happy moments. It's a great soundtrack in every respect and it really helps draw you in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are all distinctive personalities. From the tsundere Kaede, the sleepy headed Kazuho to the inquisitive and sweet Renge. Every single character displays a diverse personality that makes each one memorable in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As you can tell from this gushing with nothing but praise review, I have enjoyed this anime and it really sparked me into an appreciation for the Slice of Life genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it to you. From moments of hectic scenes and silly scenes to serious heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, this anime will keep your heart pumping with diverse emotions.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

Sometimes they visit the candy store, sometimes they work in the fields and sometime they are working on a school event. Whatever the day is, it is filled with joy, laughter and a beautiful countryside.\r\nStory 8/10:\r\nIt starts off with Hotaru coming to the countryside from Tokyo due to her dad's job. She joins the school in which all students (5 of them) study in a different grade but in the same classroom. 4 of the students are girls and 1 is aboy. Each episode tells a new adventure/story about the 4 girls in the countryside. It's all fun and lighthearted comedy meant to be enjoyed without a care in the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe animation is good for an anime like this. Making cute characters to go with the anime atmosphere. The scenery and background are really nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Nanairo Biyori\" is performend by Nano Ripe. It's quite a nice song to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nA really enjoyable series. It's meant to be watched just for fun and to pass the time with some light hearted comedy and cute characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a really good anime. And I'm glad it's getting a sequel \"Non Non Biyori Repeat\"\\n\r\nWatch it if you want some nice warm slice of life anime.",

            "content": "Due to personal circumstances, early in the Fall 2013 anime season, I found myself unable to keep up with the latest anime. As it were, there's weren't very many fall anime shows that appealed to me very strongly in the first place... so even now now that I have the time to catch up, it's just a handful of anime I feel compelled to see through to completion. Standing out among those very few fall shows that I was still compelled by was Non Non Biyori. There was just something so very ingratiating about what I had seen on display in the first few episodesof the series I had watched back in the fall to where I couldn't bring myself to just drop it and move along as I had done with so many other fall anime. No, instead I quickly found the time to sit down and watch all of this charming little series. Having done so now, I can say without a doubt that this is a real treat the whole way through. \\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori was produced by Silver Link, the studio who brought us BakaTest and Watamote among other series. It's a bit of a departure from what they've done before; a much more earnest, understated sort of school comedy. That an anime studio could follow up something so thoroughly cynical and uncomfortable by design as Watamote with such a effortlessly charming and affecting little show as this is actually kind of impressive to me. What's perhaps even more impressive, however, is how very enjoyable it was. While Silver Link has proven themselves to be a fairly competent studio, I would say that Non Non Biyori is their best work yet.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of it is in the production. Silver Link has made some good looking anime, including fairly recently the incredibly sharp looking Fate/Kaleid Prisma Illya. This understated little slice of life anime can be just as impressive as that often flashy magical girl action series somehow. The art is absolutely gorgeous. Rarely do we get such beautiful scenery shots in the anime. There isn't any need for lots of flashiness in the animation, but it still never looks anything less than good. Sound is equally excellent. The voice cast was well selected and really do a lot to make their characters come alive. Background music is well chosen. Both the opening and ending themes suit the show perfectly and ooze charm.\\n\\n\r\nWhy Non Non Biyori is a great anime has even more to do with the content of the show than the package though. A lot of it comes down to the uniqueness of the premise. Non Non Biyori, at its core is an anime focusing on moments, comedic and otherwise in lives of four young girls who attend school together. There are, of course, dozens of anime which can be described with those exact terms or terms similar; it's the specifics set Non Non Biyori apart. Through anime, I know I've probably seen well over a decades worth of years in the lives of Japanese students, but Non Non Biyori stands out a lot and it's in lare part due to its choice of setting. Rather than another year spent in a big city or an average town, Non Non Biyori is set in a far off, remote rural farm community. Only a few families live in the area, so the school the girls attend only has five students, all of whom are different ages and thus in different grades. Country life is depicted in a earnest, realistic way that makes it seem all the more engaging and at times magical. It's a definite change of pace from the norms of genre and undoubtedly adds to what makes Non Non Biyori so great.\\n\\n\r\nEven more important are the characters. For a slice of life comedy series, this is the most important part. To want to watch the year in the lives of a set of characters, you need to like those characters in the first place. Non Non Biyori's characters are very endearing. The story is in part told through the eyes of Hotaru, a city girl in the fifth grade who has just moved to the country with her family. She takes her time adjusting, but soon starts to fit in and really fall in love with her new surroundings. What helps in this is Komari, a middle schooler two years older who Hotaru develops a crush on.  The two are a tale of contrast, Hotaru, despite her age being tall and adult like in demeanor and appearance, while Komori is short and child like. Joining them is Komari's sister Natsumi, a year younger, who is energetic and fun loving but poor at school. Tiny first grader Renge rounds out the main cast, providing much humor and cuteness with her often precocious attitude. Supporting players include, among others, Renge's adult sister, the lazy and sleepy Kazuho who works as the girls only teacher; Kaede, the owner of a local rarely visited candy shop who has a strong bond with Renge; and Suguru, the fifth student in the class, who is actually Natsumi and Komari's older brother, who never speaks and is seldom noticed by the others, even when he displays surprising talents.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the cast are likable and affecting. They are developed very well through the series' 12 episodes. The main characters are all well geared toward providing humor, but they are also suited to providing surprisingly poignant moments as well. Ultimately that is the greatest strength of the show, its heart. It's warm, it's affecting and just very hard not to love. A thoroughly masterful little anime. Strongly recommended.",

            "content": "~ Do you live in the country? ~\r\nIntense action anime getting you too heated up? Then look no further for a relaxing cooldown...\r\nAnother heartwarming, moe-infused anime, documenting the lighthearted antics of 4 cute and quirky female protagonists. This is undoubtedly the definition of \"cute girls doing cute things\", and should be considered a staple of the \"moe fan\" diet.\r\nUplifting, charming, casual, and humerus from start to finish. This is another prime example of a dedicated Slice of Life presentation, which relishes in its simplicity. Now it goes without saying that the Slice of Life genre is met with mixed responses. Some are appreciative of thesecarefree stories and lighthearted character insights, whereas others cannot deal with such accused \"uneventfulness\". Wherever in this spectrum you are: Non Non Biyori is a \"feel-good\" anime beyond measure. It's down-to-earth and presents a realistic, yet skewed life perspective. \"Escapism into an optimistic mindset\", you might say.\\n\\n\r\nNow the premise is really what gives Non Non Biyori its flavor... Arriving in a rural countryside setting, the surrounding landscape is beautifully picturesque, and the relatively \"deserted\" nature of this place means that our cast really are in a world of their own. Devoid of big city skyscrapers and streams of headlights, everything is so serene and peaceful: pertaining to the relaxing and heartwarming tone of the show very well. Non Non Biyori's \"plot\" takes us on a journey: documenting the various antics and activities that our main characters get up to, in their secluded little village. The storytelling is fragmented, like picking out exerts of a person's life, and the pacing is both leisurely enough to feel relaxing, and hastened enough to create an appreciable sense of passing time. This is some feat for a 13 episode show, but as is expected of a Slice of Life dedicated anime,\\n\r\nit is the character development as opposed to story complexity that really shines through.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, we get to meet with a healthy spectrum of differing personalities...\\n\r\nIntroducing our main group of 4: from Renge's nonsensical and humerus monotone observations, to Horatu's over-idolization, to Komari's \"maturity plight\", and Natsumi's dominating energy... The \"colours\" of our quartet are fortunately quite  distinct, likable, and most importantly: this diversity creates a rather convincing, while intriguing and entertaining character chemistry. On the rare occasion that they aren't all together, we get an insight into a character's thought process: one of the most intimate, and appreciation-boosting connections that can be established. Its true that their identity is more rightfully as a group of friends, and so there really is an emphasis on chemistry, and chatter, over pure backstory-depth etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe spotlight is quite evenly distributed, and this stress on synergy over individuality (though of course, they are clearly made to be different), means that the group conveys a wholesome aura of camaraderie. They are quite convincingly: a tightly-knit group of friends, which is furthered by their situation, remember? \"Isolated in the countryside, but they have each other\". Now that may sound like the cheesiest line you've heard all day, but as a result: this \"majoring\" in character chemistry, means that we're treated to a lot of dialogue exchange of both pointlessness and substance, simultaneously. The chatter is imbued with both personality and comedy. It is the author's vent of each character's essence and identity, as we learn of our protagonists through their own words, as opposed to being told, or simply introduced.\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple, infinitely heartwarming, and provides a bunch of likable protagonists: enjoying their own disconnected world, and engaging in rather\\n\r\nentertaining outbursts of spontaneity and conversation.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisuals now...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Non Non Biyori is a \"Starry Night\" of its own... With lots of serene and beautifully picturesque backgrounds, drowned in vivid colour, superb lighting, and detail. The characters are well-defined and not blatantly overlayed atall. They move freely, and expressively, with some integration of comedy into their emotions. Everything has a genuinely notable sense of personality to it in this show. In terms of audio, Non Non Biyori delivers a very friendly, calming, and simplistic, xylophone and accordion oriented score which favors the emphasis of personality and a carefree vibe, over atmosphere. It's highly appropriate, and paired with an excellent OP which summarizes the whole thing perfectly.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFinishing up now...\\n\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is a greatly escapist Slice of Life styled experience, with a very distinct personality, flavor, and an appreciably small, likable set of country-dwelling characters. It is a feast for both the eyes, and ears... Which will inevitably leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. So why stop at 8? Well i'm a fan of this minimalism, and this is undoubtedly one of the most charming SoL setups i've seen to date. I'm stopping at 8 though (from a critical perspective), because while there is a start to our \"story\", direction is lacking, and the conclusion is too abrupt. At times the characters become too predictable, which leaves a weaker spot towards the middle of the season... Though it picks up character and sentimentality value nicely particularly at my favourite episode: 10. The characters themselves, are developed to a degree for VERY enjoyable chemistry, but besides Renge: hide behind facades to an extent... And it would have been nice to see some more personal growth to suffice as a more hearty conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe i'm over thinking it, or maybe you enjoyed this analysis...\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori is exactly what you think it as, and a little bit better.\\n\r\nHeartwarming, uplifting and beautiful: I'd recommend it to any SoL supporter, seeking out for something uplifting, humerus, and above all: chock full of personality!\\n\\n\r\n~ 'Cause it's fun over here! ~",

            "content": "well, I have to confess that Non Non Biyori surprised me in a good way. I found it far more enterteining and enjoyable that I originally thought. I was expecting a relaxing slice of life anime in which nothing happens and I get... well I get exactly that, but I found myself smiling from the beggining to the end.\r\nAfter this short introduction, let's start this review.\r\nI will begin talking about the thing that in my opinion is the strongest point of the series: the characters.\r\nAll the show follows the \"less is more\"  premise, and this also includes the cast of characters. It has 4main characters: Komari, the oldest of the group, who is complexed about her height; Natsumi, her younger and air-headed sister; Renge, the youngest of the group and by far the most interesting and Hotaru, a girl who came from Tokyo who knows almost nothing about living on the countryside.\\n\r\nWith this simple and short cast of characters The story is developed. Now I want to talk about Renge, AKA Ren-chon, who is, in my opinion, the best character of the anime and one of the best child character I have ever seen. \\n\r\nRenge is fantastic. Maybe this is because I grew up in a similar place, but I can see me with 6 years old reflected on almost all Renge's actions. I'm not talking about her personality, I never was that... unique, I'm talking about her way of perceiving the world, her way of reacting against situations and how she can found the funny side of everything. She is like my past self and also as the children who grew up with me. I think that all of us had more things in common when we were younger than now, and this is also the reason why I think Renge is awesome. She made me think about this, and made me think about the beauty of being a child only with walking over a ramp only because she wanted to jump to the ground when she was going home after the school.\\n\r\nI have also to mention the side characters, being the most remarkable ones Renge's older and middle sisters, Komari and Natsumi older sister and the owner of the sweets shop. The show has also few side characters, but they are enough lovable for not missing more of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is almost episodic. the different chapters tell us the different stories the girls live on the first year Hotaru lives on the village. Is true that the chapters have a progression, but in most of the cases you could swap the order of the chapters and nothing would happen. \\n\r\nIs true that the show could be labeled as a comedy, but I think the show aims more to generate a relaxing mood an puting a smile on your face rather than make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe show sound pretty good. The sountrack is gentle and discrete, but it sounds great and its main theme probably stay on your head for a while. The voice acting is fantastic, being my favourite ones Renge's, hotaru's and nii-chan's ones (sorry, I had to do the joke :3).\\n\r\nI know this should not be present on a review, but I have to make an special mention to the ending.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, its visuals. The animation is nothing remarkable, but I think in this type of show expending more money or time on a better animation wouldn't make any difference on the final result so it's fine.\\n\r\nHowever the art is very nice, and the characters are very well drawn (the mouths suffer the typical bad positioning when the characters are seen from the profile, tho).\\n\\n\r\nI would like to end this review with a recomendation. If you are going to watch Non Non Biyori, take your time to do it. Watch a chapter before going sleep or after taking a bath. you only have to relax and enjoy.",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori: Repeat \u3011\r\nNon Non Biyori is a series that I feel was forgotten and left to the wayside, even though it was actually good. People were probably put off by the fact that it takes place in the country and the cast consists mostly of little kids, the oldest of the main group is thirteen and the youngest is eight. It was actually a really refreshing series though, I loved the bejeezus out of it. \r\n\t\u2022 I\u2019m sure that people thought that this series would be the second coming of Ginno Saji, but the atmosphere in this series is completely different. It less focuses on the agricultural and more on the moe and precious childhood moments, which I was a fan of. It didn\u2019t help that Renge was the most adorable thing ever!\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Much like Higurashi, the school is so small that all of the grades are in one classroom. So, there\u2019s two sisters and their otaku brother. A transfer student from Tokyo. And little Renge and the teacher, who happens to be her older sister. The music, directing, scenery, and slow pace is all comforting, like you\u2019re taking a warm bath after a day of work.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There are actually episodes where things get real on mature level and it gives you a moment to take it in, before the atmosphere returns to something kind and beautiful. The melancholy in Non Non Biyori is what makes it so lovely, because if it were just another, \u201cWe\u2019re just being cute girls,\u201d happy-go-lucky moe show then it would be nothing to talk about. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 It reminded me of the episode of the second season of Yuru Yuri, where the show addresses that Akari is overlooked because of her lack of presence, despite being the main character and she has a full-blown existential crisis. Darker themes in moe shows seem to attract more of the otaku crowd, seeing as Kemono Friends had no attention until it became a darker, post-apocalypse show.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Even in Western cartoons, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic has garnered such an adult following because its tendency to be casually dark and throw its viewership for a loop. Back to Non Non though, the characters are all really lovable. They all do things or have moments, where you\u2019re like, I can understand why this character is going through that or I used to do that when I was a kid! \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I would recommend Non Non Biyori to anyone. Don\u2019t let the slow pace deter you, it\u2019s part of the experience. It will grow on you like mold after a few episodes, but that\u2019s pretty much guideline to enjoying moe. It\u2019s better to watch after the characters are already established, so that when things happen, you have a deeper understanding of their characters.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Like, K-On is going to seem foreign to you right off the bat, until you give it a few episodes and get to know the characters. I initially dropped Yuru Yuri when it was first airing, because the part of Akari\u2019s sister having a collection of her underwear and stuff creeped me out, but if you get further and trek past that point, it becomes endearing.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 This show is obviously one of those series that was publicized to decrease the population in Tokyo and get weird otakus to move to the countryside. And it worked. After watching this, I considered moving to the country. Non Non is a slice of life that I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel childhood nostalgia gleefully portrayed in tandem with cute girls. I give Non Non Biyori and Non Non Biyori Repeat a 7/10.",

            "content": "Non non biyori, recommended by one of the Instagram users to me. At first, I don't know what anime was this, so I search the Internet and found this. 4 Girls living in countryside, with one whom is Hotaru, who moved from Tokyo, doing everyday life in countryside. I searched the genre of this, and this really really suited me for December Holidays. I know this was released last year but hey, some people are watching this.  A comedy, slice of life anime, perfect. I finished 12 episodes in one day. So let me give you my results.\r\nStory: 8/10, the story focuses on thefour girls enjoying their life in countryside, one girl who came from the city trying to adapt the surrounding of the area while the other 3 girls are curious about going to the big city which is Tokyo. Nevertheless, the story is just about their everyday life in the country side adding with comedy scences.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10, the character designs are well suited and designed for it, Renge-chan being the most kawaii girl to be design, but what made me impressed about the art, is the surrounding of the village. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10, I LOVE THE OST, OP AND THE ED songs. It's really relaxing, kudos for that! \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10, why? RENGE-chan! The 7 year old and 130cm girl, made me score this result. Though she is 7 years old, but she has the capacity to act like an adult person, also she could draw really well of Koma-chan. She is also really an energetic person for a 7 year old. No judge but she's definitely the best. While Houtaru, she is a 5th grader but already having the grown up woman characteristics, and grew rapidly to 161 cm.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly enjoyment: 10/10, Though this show is already one year old, and I just watch it yesterday, it seems that this show helps us to relax and laughing with all the hilarious scenes they made, Silver Link has done this again. It really attract me a lot to watch this. So whenever i feel sad or bored, this helps me laugh and cheer up, also give me some inspiration because of the moeness from the 4 girls, especially Renge.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, this helps me end my 2014 with a very good slice of life anime, I'm thankful to watch this. I can say best of the best. I RECOMMEND this anime to be watch by all of the viewers who are finding any anime shows to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2nd season is in production and hopefully, it will be a more hilarious and fun and also maybe more episodes than season 1. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this review. \\n\\n\r\nHappy Holidays\\n\r\nHappy Advance New Year!\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "As has been noted in other reviews, the slice-of-life genre has arguably been overused in anime to the point of parody, where it can be difficult to take a new series seriously. After near-saturation of Lucky Star and K-On clones, many anime fans were wondering just what they originally saw in \"cute girls doing cute things\", with some of the more cynical claiming it's partially responsible for the rash of antisocial shut-in cases in Japan, not to mention the country's drastically declining birthrate.\r\nAnd then some crew comes along with a clear labor of love like Non Non Biyori, and we're reminded just why we weredrawn to the SOL genre in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the absence of a single driving plot, the key to slice-of-life is atmosphere and character. The girls here are mostly unremarkable as far as anime characters go but relateable, behaving in manners appropriate to their ages (7-14), barring some plot-relevant foibles. Despite city-mouse Hotaru, who's just moved to the countryside from Tokyo, setting the plot in motion with her arrival (and occasionally narrating), the character who will likely leave the biggest impact on audiences is 1st grader Renge and her optimistic yet na\u00efve (and rather bizarre) view on the world. (And while she largely seems to be a relatively satisfied little girl, we still see some evidence of loneliness in her being the youngest in her group, with no friends her own age.) Renge is not the first quirky dark-horse favorite in anime by far, but her deadpan expression and malapropism \"Nyanpassu\" stand out in this past anime season. That said, I also greatly enjoyed Kaori Nazuka's sleepy, carefree delivery as the girls' slacker teacher.\\n\\n\r\nBut where NNB truly shines (literally at times) is in its artwork and sound. The show makes no secret in broadcasting the glories of the Japanese countryside, especially toward the nation's cramped urban dwellers. I have always admired the color palettes of the background artwork in Japanese animation, and it seems like Silver Link spared no expense here. The producers also take wonderful advantage of the rural setting through numerous reflective pauses in the action for the sleepy leitmotifs of the BGM, and occasionally for appropriate sound effects. This is what I mean when I talk about atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of atmosphere, while there obviously is not a real overreaching plot in this show, despite its general good feeling, there is perhaps a small undercurrent of sadness here. This is a real back-of-beyond area, and of course these four girls (and a comic-relief brother) are the only students left in their all-grade school. Japan, like many developed countries, has seen drastic, ongoing population decrease in its rural areas...and of course our heroines only seem to have each other. Now remember what I said about Renge earlier... I'm probably reading a bit too much into things here (I majored in creative writing, after all), but it's just one thing about this show that I wouldn't have crossed my mind with the more standard city-based schoolgirl show.\\n\\n\r\nNow some may denounce these strongest traits as superficial eye and ear candy. Does NNB \"deserve\" to be put on a pedestal alongside Evangelion or Akira, regarded as one of Japan's best ever animated productions? On some level it doesn't quite; it's obviously not the most ambitious show, but with its lush colors, beautiful music and sound, and reflective, sentimental pace, NNB brings some grace back to the somewhat maligned SOL genre. And if you enjoyed it, as I did, that's all the justification you need for however you rated it right now, even if you won't remember it a year from now (or eventually wonder why you rated it so high).",

            "content": "Just finished that intense anime that had you on the edge of your seat? (Non-Spoiler) P.s. What's to spoil really...\r\nNon Non Biyori is the kind of Slice-of-Life/Comedy you can just sit down, relax, and call it a day watching. Just why is that?\r\nTHE STORY is nothing to write home about. Every episode however brings a bit of character development and makes you love these girls... and the awkwardly silent brother... What you have is a very big for her age fifth grader who moved from Tokyo into the country. She learns what its like to not have anything around but develops something special as aresult. FRIENDSHIP. Every episode you see a bit build on this foundation between these lovely girls.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART is specially good. You can see every feeling promoted through the artwork. I specifically love the way Hotaru is drawn. Not to mention Renge a close favorite. Even the side characters were drawn well. If you like the modern day art you will love these.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND for the the voice acting is great. There isn't a single voice actor that turned me off while watching the series. Well, maybe just one. The brother of the Koshigaya's, Suguru. (This was a joke and you would have to watch to understand.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER development was probably the best category here. The way the story developed all 4 of these girls each episode showed their budding friendship to the world. It makes you learn who admires who. The personalities of those around them. It even explores side characters like Candy Store and Renge's past.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT is satisfactory. This is the type of anime I can just turn on and casually watch while I fall asleep. Everything is cute, makes you smirk, and occasionally laugh. It's definitely worth the watch on a bored cold day inside. For the slice-of-life's fans it's possibly near the top of the list.",

They could have easily broken the whole show by making Renge a stereotypical witty little girl who acts like she was much older than her age, and I'm so glad they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I like all other characters too, and like the fact that they expanded the cast as the show went on: something that too many anime don't do, missing much potential.\\n\\n\r\nHow is this not the recipe for the perfect slice-of-life anime?",

            "content": "I have to admit that I did not pick this series up when it came out originally, but only after it was almost finished. The synopsis did not make me curious at all, after all, Slice of Life is pretty generic and unless you do enjoy the genre you will rather look for something with more blood and guts and panty shots.\r\nThankfully Non Non Biyori has none of these. In fact at points almost nothing goes on. However the enjoyment factor is very large based on a solid set of characters that will leave you laughing and doing the Kawaii thing regularly. \r\nI enjoy Sliceof Life as a rule, and there is usually one character that shines over the rest. NNB is the opposite, all of its characters shine, and they are all fascinating. The young Renge dominates the story, although in reality it is about Hotaru who moves to the country from Tokyo and starts to attend a school with a bunch of kids that seem to be very contented with their lives.\\n\\n\r\nHotaru is wonderful, although she does not seem to fit into the 5th grader profile that they have slotted her into. If anything she is very mature and balanced and the calmest of them all. IMHO this is one failing of the series, Hotaru does not quite act her age. Did I mention she takes a shining to somebody?? \\n\\n\r\nI can't really point out any single thing that makes this show so enjoyable. It just is. There are no gratuitous upskirt shots or lingering images of busty school girls with sex on their minds. Even the requisite beach episode is calm and gentle and altogether innocent. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot comment much on OPS or EDS because frankly I never really noticed them, and the artwork is beautiful. The main strengths here are the characters and their interaction with each other and their environment. It makes for an enjoyable series that is easily rewatched in any order. and which is perfect to while away time with.\\n\\n\r\nRecommend it? definitely! Second season? I hope so. \\n\r\nIn fact if more shows of this quality were made I would be very happy because frankly I did not care much for the past season. There seems to be a lack of originality in a lot of anime lately, and much is geared towards pulling in fans through gratuitous panty shots. NNB can pull in fans through sheer quality alone, and in my book that is a good thing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

She attends a school with just a few kids, and there is a lot of adventuring . It's heart-warming and unique in its childlike essence. You can simply re-watch individual episodes and feel right at home again.  \r\nThe story development isn't so important here, and each episode is a little peek into friendship, family life, school, and what is mentioned above. The humor isconsistent throughout the show, and you get to live vicariously through the lovable characters as they meander through the seasons (they don't seem to grow, which is fine with me :P). It's almost like reliving your golden days. \\n\\n\r\nSo... sit back and enjoy. Once you hear the simple notes of Renge's recorder, all will be well .. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

However, the blend of humour and amazing character building makes this probably one of my favourite anime series.\r\nThe main story of Non Non Biyori is about a girl called Hotaru Ichijo moving to a remote village in the middle of the Japanese countryside due to her father's job. Here she attends the school, which is an all-in-one of a primary school, middle school and high school. Here she meets some of the other main characters suchas Renge Miyauchi (my personal favourite), Natsumi Koshigaya, Komari Koshigaya, Suguru Koshigaya and the teacher Kazuho Miyauchi. From episode one, the series focuses on the friendship development between all of the characters, especially the newcomer Hotaru Ichijo.\\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this anime so special? Simply put, it's hilarious and the characters are perfectly made to make you feel an attachment to them. That's it.\\n\\n\r\nI'd even go as far as saying that this anime perfects the Slice of Life genre, maybe even beating out Nichijou.\\n\\n\r\nThe second series is a repeat of the first series, however from different perspectives and is basically the same as the first, however there is very little feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.",

            "content": "I freaking love this anime! Non Non Biyori is my favourite anime of all time; it melts my heart every time I watch it, and it never fails to make me happy when I am feeling sick or depressed. Let's review it, shall we?\r\n  The first aspect of this anime that immediately caught my eye was the exquisite background art. The first few moments of the first episode was lots of establishing shots of beautiful countryside, and it evoked a wonderful, peaceful feeling. There are seasonal changes too! Much like Vivaldi's Four Seasons, the series perfectly captures the unique feel of each season.Another aspect of this show I love is the music! Hidamari Michi to Ren-chon, the first song that plays, soothes me so much. I love how the song perfectly fits the transition from establishing shots to Renge playing her recorder. I listen to the whole soundtrack regularly, while writing, because it relaxes me so much.\\n\\n\r\n  The characters are so cute! Renge is my favourite; I love every scene that she is in. I love the stoic expression she has most of the time, I love her curious nature, I love her unique naming sense, I love her talents; Renge is best girl.\\n\\n\r\n  Side note: this anime may have been what triggered my love of Shoujo Ai and Yuri, due to Hotaru's adorable crush on Koma-chan.\\n\\n\r\n  This series reminds me very much of my early childhood. I grew up on an Island, in a house that was about a kilometer from the main village. The elementary school was pretty small, not as small as the one in Non Non Biyori, but still pretty small. I spent a lot of time enjoying nature and catching small creatures as a small child. I bought snacks with pocket change at the store. Basically, Non Non Biyori reminds me of my childhood, with rose-tinted glasses. This show fills me with a nice sense of familiarity.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall, I give Non Non Biyori a 10/10! I love the art, the music, the characters, and the sense of familiarity from living in a small village myself. The only flaw I can see with this show is the super slow pace; some audiences may not be able to enjoy it because of that. Another show I recommend is K-On, which is also a CGDCT show.",

            "content": "Alrighty, first review. Excuse the (noobishness?) of the review considering i've only really read a few others. Just really wanted to get a review out. So yeah, non non biyori.\r\nSo I've never been a huge fan of moe-blob type anime. They're relaxing, fun, comedic and all, but I usually find myself rushing to the final episode without really taking time to appreciate the show itself. But with Non Non Biyori, I found it completely different in the aspect of delivering to the viewer with pure enjoyment. With other moe anime such as Tamako Market, barakamon, usagi drop, and the small part of hidamari sketch thatI did see, it wasn't even on the same spectrum of Non Non Biyori. I never attached myself to the characters as well as I did with this series. They all have distinct personalities, but ones that are not to stressed to the point of unrealisticness. Now to the scoring.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\n(+) Each individual story in the show has a very distinct objective at the beginning, but can go a completely opposite direction, which actually surprisingly creates some A-class humor imo. \\n\r\n(+/-) Usually 2-3 different stories in each episode, which for the ones who don't enjoy these types of shows can make the episode feel longer, but for the ones who love it, the lengthening feel of the episodes makes it even more enjoyable\\n\r\n( - ) With the series itself being episodic, you never get a continuous plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\n(+) Beautiful artwork,  bright and colorful backgrounds which adds to the atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\n(+) Animation so good it creates it's own comedic situations\\n\r\n(+) Character design done wonderfully, expressions of characters and their interactions with the world they live in work perfectly together, well done Silver Link animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\n( - ) Though the music in the show is relaxing and really makes you dwell deep into the show, it's not all to memorable, and is honestly pretty forgettable. And I'm not one to forget good soundtracks.\\n\r\n(+) Outstanding voice casting. All the voices fit quite well, but one single individual comes to mind whenever I think of the voices, and I'm sure it's the same for everyone else as well, Renge. This actually surprises me because I despised Kotori Koiwai's voice acting in Charlotte, which actually made me drop the show after episode 2. But hey, well done this time.\\n\r\n(+) A+ Opening with an exceptional ending song to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\n(+) As I said in the beginning of this review, the distinction of the characters are immeasurable to many other anime.\\n\r\n(+) The sound and art aren't the only thing to contribute to the atmosphere to the show. The characters presence and how they react to certain situations make the mood joyous and help connect to the characters in ways unimaginable\\n\r\n( - ) Not a lot of screen time for the twins' brother. Even though he was more of a gag character, I would have really enjoyed a skit or two (not even episode) with him leading the stories main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\n(+) With the tranquil and calm world that Non Non Biyori has and the lively characters it presents, the show never fails to disappoint a great mix of the two and often results in some unbearably funny situations.\\n\r\n(+) Learning about how the characters live and the situations they encounter along with how they deal with them is overall very enjoyable.\\n\r\n( - ) Only 1 or 2 stories I had no real interest in.\\n\\n\r\nWell there is my first review, hope everyone reading it enjoyed.",

            "content": "Non Non Biyori is a masterclass in slice of life anime. A beautiful, relaxing world awaits for those who step in, as it waits for the audience with open arms and an air of sweet nostalgia.\r\n    Viewers unacquainted with Non Non Biyori would quickly find themselves surrounded by rich earth, wholesome greenery, savoury blue skies, as have I when starting the series. Experiencing the first episode was akin to enjoying hot brewed tea, in that one could go through it at an amiable and relaxed pace, where upon completion, one would feel a sense of tranquility that comeswith drinking some damn good tea. Non Non Biyori strikes me as a competent show that sets and sticks with its pace throughout, evident from the very first episode, with each sequence happening in vignettes.  Also, the relaxing nuance and tone set by its writers was enjoyable and well worthy of praise, hardly have I seen an all girls Slice-of-Life without the crazy and whacky characters getting into dumb antics cause LOL random.\\n\\n\r\n    Further inspection into this show yields greater insights into what makes Non Non Biyori such a fantastic ride through and through.\\n\\n\r\n    We start off with Hotaru, having just moved into the village, she makes new friends with her classmates in her new school. They now go on about their daily lives, experience adventures and have fun in the idyllic mountains. This series captures such instances of their daily lives. As per the slice of life genre, this show lacks an overarching plot and acts merely as an eyepiece to what any character may be up to at any moment of time.\\n\\n\r\n  For most of Non Non Biyori, we find ourselves watching events through the perspective of Hotaru, occasionally with wide-eyed wonder as the new environments hide many surprises. Among the new sights and sounds, we encounter the other main characters of Non Non Biyori as well, with personalities as varied as as the landscapes we see throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nKomachi flutters from mature upperclassman to a clumsy and precocious character, while Natsumi, her sister, portrays a carefree, lackadaisical personality that is tempered with occasional ingenuity and common sense. \\n\\n\r\nRenge is opaque, a brick wall, albeit, an entertaining brick wall, as most six-year olds are, and also my favourite character. Yes I share the same opinion as all other viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe brother is there as well. \\n\\n\r\nHotaru remains neutral, and behind this neutrality hides repressed childlike curiosity and excitement, given that she is twelve years old after all. (Yes, do not let appearances fool you, she is twelve. Because Anime.)\\n\\n\r\nAdd in the colourful side characters and this show\u2018s writers have crafted a powerful, nuanced driving force behind its narrative. It is clear that love was put into creating such a delightful cast, the most important feature in a slice of life anime.\\n\r\n(Yes, this is a long segment. What do you expect? Characters are the quintessential part of Slice of Life anime, with no other grand narrative or ultimate objective to move towards, and the only draw for watchers. No doubt I would allocate a large portion of my word count to elaborating on this aspect of the show. Back to the review.)\\n\\n\r\n  Visually, Non Non Biyori is a treat. Finely painted backdrops of natural environments are prevalent throughout the series, acting as focal points for the current narrative, usually shown through a long pan or still frame, giving the premise a scenic feel. Also let me try out my amateur film analysis here. This director is also fond of zooming in on still objects as a form of cutting between scenes, a technique that helps to maintain immersion for the viewer, and also helping reinforce the message of the show, to \u201cTake life easy.\u201d just as our cast have. Thus, such a technique diverts our attention from the action, just as one strays their eyes when relaxing, fixating attention on something normally of little interest. \\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetic is also bright, cheerful and easy on the eyes as plenty of colours are mixed to give calming hues and add ambience. In terms of character animation, sadly, they are not as intricate or meticulous as the backdrops, but are just as serviceable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are endearing, where Renge\u2019s hair is like an insect and is adorable and her mouth which is always a triangle no matter what is happening and other character quirks that are too cute to handle and\u2026\u2026\u2026...Well, you get the idea. The characters are all distinct and serve their roles competently. It has a strong \u201canime\u201d flavour to it, to put bluntly. Still, Kudos to Silver Link Studio here, the way they made their immersive forests, scenic hills and soothing natural environments shows their visual design to be outstanding and well worthy of praise. \\n\r\n   t made me feel like I had stepped out of my room into beautiful nature, which is nice because I do not leave my room.\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment can also be found when listening to its soundtrack. Many of these arrangements sound unique and all carry the same distinct nostalgic flavour. Sound design is also top notch, when immersing viewers in the sounds of the great outdoors: cicadas, the sound of summer heat, cows mooing and so on. Sounds like a quiet village indeed. The opening and ending songs are on point as well, full of personality and life. I do not have much more to say, except that I have the soundtrack on my IPod. It is good.\\n\\n\r\n  All in all, Non Non Biyori understands its role: to provide one with relaxing entertainment, and pushes to do so through engaging storytelling, affable comedy and crafting an immersive, beautiful world.  It is far from a technical masterpiece, yet it does not need to be one, to spark a sense of nostalgia in its audience, welcoming them home with open arms. Non Non Biyori is a work that boasts great accessibility and equally great enjoyment, a must-try for anyone interested in the Slice-of-Life genre.\\n\\n\r\nI gave it all 10s ?",

            "content": "The first thing I've noticed about this anime is the beautiful scenery. Okay, it's moe too, but so is 90% of other slice of life stuff.\r\nNon Non Biyori focuses on lives of four girls who go to the same school, their families and friends. Okay, that's nothing new. We've seen that a thousand times before. But NNB has something that other similar shows don't have. It has... \"it\". Some charm that makes it enjoyable. I can't describe it; you'd have to watch it to see for yourself.\r\nThe girls are all of different age. Yet they all go to the same class because they live inmiddle of nowhere and nobody else goes to the school except them. Well, two of them have an older brother who also goes to their class, but he has very little screen time. In fact, we never even hear him speak?! To make things more interesting, the sisters and their brother have another older sister who's the teacher in their class.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show is very pleasant to look at. Not only the characters are cute, but the surroundings are beautiful, too. Countryside never looked this pretty. The girls still have fun in their free time, but since they aren't from the city, they don't have fun the way city folks do. It's interesting to see how they make their own fun.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, like many other SoLs, this isn't very exciting, so if you're looking for action, tension and thrilling scenes, you won't find them here. But if you want to relax and feast your eyes after a hard working day, NNB can be the anime for you. SoL lovers, give it a shot if you already haven't!",

It's a feel-good series that will brighten your days even if your sad with rare touching moments in it. Not a very original plot with cliched characters.\r\nI don't know why people are so into these characters, they're pretty much your typical whiny kid. The only one I like out of the bunch and is my favorite character is Natsumi, now she was fun to watch but not greatbecause she does get explosive. But the other characters are mediocre, Hotaru is a crybaby, Komari is a know-it-all who hates being called and treated like a little girl. And the youngest girl (I forgot her name but I think it's Rin), rather acts more like an adult than a kid.\\n\\n\r\nI'm one who doesn't think this needs a sequel because I'm not fond of Non Non Biyori, it was a childish and silly comedy series with some weird elements to it, not surprising for a series aimed at kids but even they might find some of the series' music too babyish. Though, the series is not very very weird but it's still weird. Though, some parts did make me laugh but some jokes fell flat.",

All of the characters have distinctpersonalities, and it's so easy to fall in love with every single one.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this masterpiece, I found myself wanting to go wander around and play like a kid again.

            "content": "This anime is a panacea of the heart and mind.\r\nLife too stressful? Worried or anxious about something? Just sit down in front of the screen and put this anime on, and all your concerns will dissolve away - probably within seconds. Everything - setting, plot, sound, music, art, humour - all of it is perfectly crafted at maximising this effect. And what an effect it is.\r\nThe story itself is a simple one. It follows the daily lives of four girls of various ages who all live in the same rural village and are in the same class at school. Almost everything that happens is followingtheir daily lives, with events that are both realistic and completely believable. As far as overarching story goes, that's about it - this isn't an anime you should be watching if you only care for a tense plot full of twists and turns. It is predominantly episodic in nature, although characters and settings are gradually built up over time so there's no lack of progress. Each episode contains one or two stories, every single one of which is a joy to watch and will melt your heart. The humour is lighthearted in tone, and is aimed at adding to this heart-melting effect, rather than at making you laugh out loud, although there are a few moments that could do this as well. There are also a few moments that will invoke other emotions, all very effectively and very naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is focused mainly on the four girls. Komari is the eldest of the four, although you wouldn't know it by looking. She is very self conscious of the fact that she is unusually small for her age and tries to make up for this by attempting (and largely failing) to act grown up. Hotaru, on the other hand, is unusually mature, at least on a physical level, for a fifth grader. She also quickly develops a crush on her cute chibi senpai, although none of the others ever seem to realise it. Natsumi is Komari's younger sister, and is a bit of a layabout. She's too lazy to work hard at anything and is always getting in trouble for one thing or another. And then there's Renge, called \"Ren-chon\" by Natsumi. I could honestly wax lyrical about Ren-chon all day, but I don't want to bore you any more than I already am, so I'll just say that she's the youngest of the cast, who knows a lot about things that you wouldn't expect a first grade student to know, but otherwise acts fairly normally for her age. Oh, she also has some brilliant facial expressions, and Koiwai Kotori's voice acting of her character is a definite candidate for being the best I've ever come across.\\n\r\nEvery member of the supporting cast, just like the main characters, each have their own distinctive but realistic and believable personalities, and are every bit as likeable as the central four cast members.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour and characters may be brilliant, but what makes this series really stand out is the music and images. As someone who tends to focus very heavily on the characters of a series, I don't usually care much for these things - as long as they add to the immersement, enjoyment and feel of a series, just about anything's fine by me. But here even I can't help but be overwhelmed. The series starts with nothing but pictures, sound effects and music building up the scene and setting with pure imagery. It's almost 2.5 minutes before anything is actually said, yet by that time you will likely have already entered into a state of total bliss from the gorgeous artwork, more reminiscent of a high budget film or even something you might see in an art gallery than a TV series, and soothing background music and sound effects of what is being shown. And, while the effect may not be as intense in later scenes, the quality does not drop. Just about every background in this entire series is a work of art both literally and figuratively.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched the first episode over and over again and every time the effect is the same. The entire anime is thoroughly rewatchable, and every episode provides the perfect relaxation whether on your first watch or your tenth. Even brilliantly written series that depend on plot twists and reveals often grow dull when watching through for the third time, but that is of no concern for an anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of slower paced anime, however, require you to be in the right mood before watching them, but again that is of no concern here, as Non Non Biyori will put you in that right mood, no matter what your previous state of mind.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a series to be watched, loved and enjoyed over and over again. Everything is perfectly toned to add to this viewing pleasure as much as possible, and it is indeed a pure pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know what nirvana feels like, watch this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr THIS ANIME IS GAY",

            "content": "Non Non Biyori is an anime that could be described as Relaxing and Very Good for those who are looking for a story away from science fiction and based more on real life.\r\nThe story is literally a pure slice of life that shows the occurrences of these four girls in a rural village of Japan for close to a year, each episode has a different main protagonist without following a very defined sequence teaching us that \"happiness is based on Have a quiet life without worries. \"\r\nThe soundtrack is very good, an opening that for my taste is one of the best in the genreof slice of life and an ending with a rather peculiar and striking lyrics. Background sounds go well with every season that passes through the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also very well, each one of them has a different personality that contrasts with the other creating comic situations a little away from the clich\u00e9s that abound in comedies. Renge is the youngest of the group and who is usually the most perceptive, Hotaru is the new girl who comes to the village having to adapt, Natsumi is the prankster and the one who always wants to have fun at the expense of everyone and Komari is the victim of Jokes about his sister and who arouses the interest of Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\nIf you also like it as much as I see a good slice of life I'm sure that this series will enjoy much, making you remember those times when you were a child and had a life where the biggest concern was choosing to play with your friends.\\n\r\nPersonally I think that within the genre of Slice of Life is among the best three I have seen.",

It's basically a love letter to the slow, dying lifestyle of rural Japan. And yet, the show's characters make their own adventures and manage to have fun every single day. Some episodes are emotional and heartwarming, but the show doesn't hit you over the head with it. Instead, it makes excellent use of comedy without relying on absurd slapstick and cliches. \r\nMy only complaint is that some of the side characters are just as compelling as the main cast, and I would have lovedto see more of them. But overall, this is one of the most relaxing and heartfelt anime I've ever watched. It's great to sit down and binge a few episodes at the end of a long day.\\n",

Honestly, I regret that I doubted Non Non Biyori at first sight.

            "content": "Non Non Biyori\r\nArt: I absolutely love the art of this show. It is fluid and fresh and looks very new. It is rather interesting that there are so few characters in the show, but each of them are able to be easily distinguished between each other without falling into the stereotypical type casting. The background art is beautiful. The landscape and the countryside really wonderful and the colors are just fantastic. Really this show is about 75% art and scenery. \r\nSound/Music: There was quite a bit of direction on this title. Really the music is what drives this show outside of the art. They clearlyknew what they were doing with the sound direction. Having a bit of great music really takes this show to a better place for me. With things that are both fun to look at and nice to listen to it creates an atmosphere that makes me want to get invested into the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: So, while there isn\u2019t much \u2018story\u2019 to this show there is an overall plot, while it is pretty bare. What I could assume to be the main character, Hotaru, comes in to the country from the city and joins a class of four students, all different grades, in a single room. This then leads to the group becoming fast friends and over the course of the year that the story takes place, they go through all sorts of experiences together. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: I really enjoy story when it comes to shows. While this show doesn\u2019t have much of that, it has beautiful art and wonderful music. My gripe is that there was really no story. I wanted to be able to get invested into the characters, but I felt that they were pretty 2-dimensional, one didn\u2019t even have a single line the entire series! And that made it really hard to enjoy the show. Sure it isn\u2019t a bad show by any means, but to me, i felt that it fell short in a way that I would not recommend it. If you like little-to-no plot and cute characters than go for it, anything else, this might be a pass for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.5/10\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of the diamonds among the coal of slice-of-life. At first glance it seems like a typical, semi-boring slice-of-life anime about cute girls with cute dresses and cute houses, doing cute things. Seen it, tired of it... But wait! That's not just what this show is about at all! Yes, it's about the everyday life of four cute girls living in the countryside, but if you're looking for a relaxing and funny anime that will get your mind of everything else, look no further. This anime is the very definition of a slice-of-life masterpiece and you will not regret watching it ifyou like that genre. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: As mentioned, this is a story about four girls of different ages living on the countryside. It has a captivating story without even trying. Even though the girls do things they consider normal, people that don't live in the countryside will find an amusing story, and those who live in the countryside will find a charming representation of what it's like, filled with moments that makes you smile and giggle. Some may find that boring, but not me. It doesn't have one single storyline, but many small happenings in the young girls' lives, and not a single episode is the same. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I am a sucker for good art. Even though the art in this anime is the typical moe artstyle, it doesn't make this anime any less good. In fact, it really fits the rest of the art and makes the characters personalities shine. And, oh the scenery! Beautiful, country scenery with the mountains, the trees and the rice fields. This anime also perfects the use of breathing pauses that lets the animation do the talking. There are several minute long scenes that can be just a character badly playing a recorder, landscape shots or waiting for a reaction, and they all work really well. It gives the viewer a chance to breathe and relax. Together it makes an absolutely gorgeous anime filled with small \"wow\" moments. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: After this anime, I had to search for the OST online at once. This soundtrack is filled with both quick and fun music and relaxing orchestra. It has a lot of outstanding tracks and really helps make the anime shine. The OP is a song by the one and only nano.RIPE. It's catchy and likable and fits very well with the mood of the anime. The same can be said about the ED, which is sung by the four main characters voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Though this anime had some anime cliches, like the tsundere loli, this anime has a very good character cast. The main cast consists of Komari, who is a tsundere and very childish, despite wanting to be adult-like, Natsumi, who is very lazy and loves pranks, Hotaru, who is responsible, but amusingly obsessed with a certain character, and Renge, an easily impressed, easily fascinated, weird and adorable kid. There's also the brother that never gets a line, the delinquent-like, but secretly kind Candy-Store and Nee-nee the lazy teacher/big sister (These are not actually their names, it's just what the kids call them). All the characters fit so well in the story and, even if some are cliches, it doesn't make the anime cliche. Each character is still very much it's own character and gives of a fun, likable and unique personality that fits the anime perfectly. They're funny, happy and sometimes amusingly over-the-top, especially Natsumi and Renge, who by the way is the cutest little thing on this planet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: There's a reason this anime made it on my top five list of favorite anime. It's fun, relaxing and adorable, and it's just so darn likable. It's the perfect anime for a slice-of-life lover like myself. I found myself always looking forward to the next episode every week, even if it didn't have any long storyarcs, cliffhangers or a single storyline to follow. It is simply an enjoyable set of the everyday happenings of these four young girls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: This is one of the most likable and lovable anime out there. it's relaxing, pleasing to both the eyes and ears, and filled with a fun and exiting character cast. The only thing that I can comment on is the fact that it has a lot of anime characters cliches and moe, something that can put people off, and the story can get boring to people that are not into everyday happenings in anime, but don't be fooled! It's definitely worth the watch! \\n\\n\r\nIf you like action and drama-filled anime, this is not for you, but if you're a fan of slice of life and comedy and like or tolerate the moe art, this is your diamond. Even if you're an all-rounder like me, who likes most genres, you're probably gonna love this anime.",

This stands above other slice of life anime due to its realism, pacing and lack of stereotyped behaviour. Some gags might involve the characters standing still and nothing happening for 10 seconds or more and it has a certain real life charm that really fits in with the countryside theme. The characters are also really unique and individual with no stereotyped \"loli\" or \"moe\" behaviour. Ren-chon is so cute and realistic almost to a Miyazaki level of adorable, and it's hard not to compare this to Totoro and someof the other sleepier Ghibli films.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favourite anime, ever since Shirokuma Cafe ended I've been waiting for something just as charming and adorable and I was very happy to see this. I'd love to see more episodes, I think this would be awesome to watch alongside Aku no Hana... you could alternate between the light and dark sides of countryside living to get two unique perspectives of this type of living.",

            "content": "First review, please don't hurt me ;w;\r\nNon Non Biyori is one of the best slice of life animes I've ever seen, and probably the best anime for the latter half of 2013. It offers everything you usually expect from a slice of life - comedy, relaxation, some more emotional moments - basically, LIFE at its finest. But let's start from the beginning.\r\nNon Non Biyori tells the story of four girls living in the country. Ichijou Hotaru, a fifth-grader from Tokyo had to move out due to her parents' work duties. The school in the country isn't exactly what she expected - together with her thereare only 5 students, each one from a different year. There she meets the rest of our lovely main cast:\\n\r\n - Miyauchi Renge (or Ren-chon), a seven year old girl with great imagination,\\n\r\n- Koshigaya Komari (or Koma-chan), an eight-grader with a height complex and the yuri love interest of Hotarun,\\n\r\n- Koshigaya Natsumi (or Nattsun), the younger, energetic sister of Komari.\\n\r\nThe fifth student is Koshigaya Suguru, the older brother of Komari and Natsumi who actually never gets to say a thing - it's a running gag. There's also room for a few side characters - my personal favorite was Kagayama Kaede, referred to by the rest of the girls as \"Candy Store\".\\n\r\nYou get to see a lot of funny situations they are encountering - there are of course your mandatory summer/winter/New Year/school festival episodes, however, they are made quite differently, so you won't get a deja vu. Take the school festival as an example - remember there only are 5 students, and you should get the idea. Overall the story was handled masterfully - all slice of life series should look like NNB.\\n\r\nAs for the art - I had no bigger remarks. It looked just like the rest of modern animes, luckily there was no 3D art (which I despise in anime). The backgrounds were created with a lot of detail - I assume the location the anime takes place in was based on an original place, because there is always a photo of a landscape at the end of each episode. You get to see a lot of wonderful, detailed places that just feel natural - a lot of it is shown in Episode 1. My personal favorite moment was at the end of the first episode, when the main cast approached a cherry tree - it was a great part. As for character designs, they were good, but sometimes you could notice a minor flaw.\\n\r\nI really liked the soundtrack and voicing for this anime. The music gives a peaceful, almost lazy vibe - a perfect example would be when Renge plays on her recorder for a longer while, walking down a road. I wasn't a big fan of the opening, but the ending, sung by the 4 main seiyuus was very enjoyable and silly. As for the voices, the seiyuus did a very good job, it wasn't above the usual standards though. Renge's voice was funny and memorable -  I'm not going to forget the \"Nyanpasu!\" she greets everyone with, miss Koiwai Kotori who voiced her did a great job.\\n\r\nAll of the characters were lovable - Hotarun's silly ideas about Komari, Komari's puberty shenanigans, Nattsun's laid-back attitude or Renge's childishness were a lot of fun to watch and couldn't be possibly developed better. The side characters also deliver - they're funny and memorable, Candy Store and Renge's sister, who is also a teacher in their school were the best. I feel that the running joke of Suguru being silent was overused and we should have at least gotten a short sentence from him in the last episode.\\n\r\nOverall, I really, really enjoyed Non Non Biyori and will try to recommend it to anyone looking for a good slice of life series. There's just a certain feeling about this anime that makes you think about it and miss it more and more. The over 20 minute-long episodes pass like a few seconds and you really crave for more. I will be impatiently waiting for the OVA and hope for another season.",

            "content": "It's pretty incredible to watch this all over again. Coincidentally enough, I watched Non Non Biyori 3 months ago on this day, so that's really neat.\r\n The girls, Renge-chon, Natsume, Koma-chan and Hotaru are fantastic. Renge is fantastic throughout the entire anime, her monotone-like voice and facial expressions are amazing and make for great comedy. Natsume and Koma-chan are really cute sisters, I think it's unique and interesting how Koma-chan, the older sister is shorter and looks more like an imouto, it makes for really funny scenarios. Hotaru; the really developed 5th grader who moved from Tokyo is great too, her perspective on living inthe country and how the rest of the girls are intruiged by it is funny.\\n\\n\r\n The support characters are great too, Candy Store was such a huge surprise when I originally watched NNB, seeing her again was fantastic. Episode 10, when we see the flashback of Candy Store and Renge together and the day ended with them both sleeping together; overwhelmed by feels. Seeing Renge and Candy Store in the current time and day also fall asleep together was just amazing. Candy Story is most definitely a surprise and a phenomenal character. The sensei, or Nee-nee is pretty great too, she's a grown up Renge and it's just so good. The other supporting characters, like Hikagi, Renge's older sister, Konomi and such, all really good, great cast of girls.\\n\\n\r\n Can't forget about Nii-chan either, he never says a word and is like an enigma, but he somehow manages to be funny and a great addition to the cast anyhow, no idea why, but it's great.\\n\\n\r\n The episode with Renge and Honoka was fantastic; even though Renge doesn't have many facial expressions, when we see Renge standing at Honoka's grandparents door, being told that Honoka had to leave yesterday, was so hard. Renge just stands there for a good long minute until it hits her that her friend has left. \\n\\n\r\n One of the best things that Non Non Biyori does, compared to most slice of life cute shows I've seen is, there are clear episodes from the beginning which set up the characters. They all have episodes dedicated to them and it really feels like you get to know them on a personal level, huge compliment to NNB for doing that.\\n\\n\r\n The OP, having to listen to it again just brings in such a rush of feelings. It's somehow nostalgic, even though it's only been 3 months since I've seen it. It's also one of the greatest OP's ever and I love the song entirely. The ED is also fantastic and just a feel good song entirely.The music in NNB is also fantastic. If you've ever wondered if an anime can use music in a meaningful way, especially in a slice of life show, NNB pulls it off so well. The recorder that Renge plays is used throughout the entire anime for BGM, it's so good. There are many great compositions to listen to through the 12 episodes. All the music is so goooood.. An OST worth owning.\\n\\n\r\n The art style doesn't need any explanation, neither does the animation. It's fantastic and absolutely beautiful, well drawn and well animated, watching Non Non Biyori is one of the most pleasant things you can do, without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\n Still one of my favorite anime I have ever seen, with each episode being well directed and having a bundle of laughs. It's really just perfection in my eyes and with Non Non Biyori Repeat already airing, more greatness to come!",

            "content": "It was a casual Sunday night of me strolling through MAL to try and find a new anime. Mostly because I was dreading the Geometry test I had Monday morning. I come across this anime cause I kinda like slice of life animes. I was somewhat surprised by all the reviews giving the same general idea \"this anime is calming and relaxing\". I decided to give it a try, and after the first 2 minutes you instantly see want people are hinting at. Music and art are probably the pieces that stand out the most. But as the show goes on, you really get attachedto the care free will of these characters. It's kinda sad that when you walk into a real high school in the real world for your geometry test, everyone always feels hostile and give the vibe telling you to shut up and don't move from your seat. And sure we can say, \"yeah its just an anime its not real\" which is true, obviously the characters are just scripted to have this care free lifestyle. But for me, it feels like an escape to the care free life I wish I had, rather then a hostile stereotype high school life. I think the best way to describe this show is as an escape from the real world, into a care free world where everyone just isn't a dick all the time.",

            "content": "Basically, It's an anime based on manga which mostly the story looks like this. I'm not the fan of this type of story.\r\nFirst, of all first thing you will see in episode 1 which I called this part is \"Introduction\", And it's a normal thing that most of anime(s) do. If I compare to Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon. This anime has nothing to compared with. And next is opening is \"Great\" I like the sound of harmonic that merge and sound really enjoyful and the melody or Vocal is match the title, sounds like 3rd year primary school kid is singing a song.\r\nLet's jumpinto story, slice of life anime is okay for me but it's not my type. I watched many of anime(s) with slice of life and I do not really enjoy all of anime that I watched which is this one does too. It's not that comedy yet not drama. When it comes to drama event it's just not drama it's just passed away and it's not drama that not even touched my heart.\\n\r\nCharacter. Hmm... I could say in one word is \"not optimized\" and this is the main selling point of the manga \"Renge\" the girl who is really genius but not smart. When doing something people will be like \"Oh my god she is really good at this\" and my thought is not like that it's too overpowered but I might think that she was taught by someone who has knowledge.\\n\r\nOkay, now the characters. Main protagonists has Hotaru, Renge, Komari, Natsumi. Hotaru she is a kind of too joyful when she is with Komari, I mean she is too annoying. But why is that happening I don't know. Renge is a girl who has a recorder that is the main instrument of the main theme. Sound really ironic good and well made. But art skill is better than her friend does but worse than me in 1st year I did better than Renge but with the long time that I didn't draw so I completely lose this skill. Most importantly that the most of her is the voice. She has low-tone voice right in the alto section. Dialogue is annoying a bit. Komari is a tsundere girl that doesn't even admit herself that she is small. Natsumi is the girl that playful talkative. So the non-protagonist is just a background all I called \"Known person\" because we didn't even pay attention to these people.\\n\r\nSound. OST is very well. Relaxing yet okay.\\n\r\nArt is mediocre to another anime.\\n\r\nEnjoyment is just like the radio when you don't pay attention to it.\\n\r\nOverall for the fan of slice of life anime. You watch nothing will go wrong and not disappointed.",

            "content": "Like many people have already said, Non Non Biyori is a great way to cheer up when you're emotionally down or relax when you are all stressed out. The show is a pure joy to watch. \r\nSTORY: 8.5-9/10\r\nYou actually get what the show is from the synopsis, there isn't something else hidden for you to discover while watching it. Cute kids playing and fooling around in the countryside. Yeah, Non Non Biyori is a pure Slice Of Life anime and for some this might seem boring. Actually it isn't boring at all, at least in my opinion. Every episode is a new adventure, which takesplace in a different  location and from episodes to episodes in different seasons as well. Even though the events are quite simple and basic, they are well made and quite original. But the best part of each episode is how goofy and funny it can get. I loved the comedy and the creativity in this anime. Everything was colourful, cute, bright, innocent and childlike, but not childish. Even if the show can be surely watched by babies as well, it's not a children's show where the protagonists count numbers and spell the alphabet. It can be watched by everyone because it doens't contain any hard, inappropriate, violent or obscure meaning. And that's the magic with Non Non Biyori. No matter how you feel, or how old you are, you have fun. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's beautiful, the character designs are excellent, the backgrounds are gorgeous and the colouring is very vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nPerfect match for the anime. It doesn't stand out but it has some very interesting tracks that create a very relaxing atmosphere. The only thing I don't like is the opening singer, she is bad in my opinion, but who cares?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime. Each character stands out and the main cast together is the most cute and hilarious thing ever. What I loved the most about the main characters is how real their friendship feels, besides their age difference. Having kids from different age groups hanging out is rare in real life unfortunately. That might actually be the only meaning Non Non Biyori has to offer. A cover doesn't necessarily defines the book itself, we all have a child within us and everyone can offer us something special, besides how old they are. These 3 things that are present in every episode of the show touched me actually.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10 \\n\r\nThe feeling I felt while watching Non Non Biyori is exactly like the feeling of happiness I feel when I wake up and look at the sky and it's crystal clear. I can only give this feeling a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nActually even a 10, that's always the toughest part. I'll need some time to decide for sure. I think this anime can be watched almost by everyone, no matter what genres they mostly like to watch. It's an anime that can be seen in a marathon mode or slowly slowly. You'll end up with a smile on your face anyway.",

            "content": "Season 1 of Non Non Biyori is a great show because the audience gets to watch how a country setting can nurture people and their relationships. \r\nThe setting itself is a character in Non Non Biyori. It has a relationship with the characters and it helps them grow and develop. This is amplified by the minimalistic but beautiful art design that accompanies the show. The simple colors add to the personality of the setting, and beautiful backgrounds help give the audience an emotional core to latch onto. This allows for the audience to feel the same emotional connection to the setting as the characters. Thusallowing the drama of the narrative to be more immersive. \\n\r\nThen there is the characters themselves, who are simple yet enjoyable to watch. The shows narrative basically consists of situations that the setting puts them in. And what makes this narrative so compelling is the characters themselves. Each character has a very different personality that when clash together make for good television. Furthermore what makes this show so much better than other moe-girl shows is how the characters grow throughout the story. The characters grow by learning to face these situations that are presented to them. Each episode a character learns something about growing up or themselves. But the real crowning goal of Non Non Biyori\u2019s story is the relationships of the characters. Without these very specific relationships that are made possible by the setting; the show would be no different from the usual moe fare. These relationships are great because each of them has a few specific quirks that work well with the other character\u2019s quirks. It\u2019s this perfect balance of quirks that makes them work so well. \\n\r\nThere are other pieces of merit within Non Non Biyori as well.  For example, there is great comedic delivery given to us from visual presentation of the film. Great timing and shot composition give the comedy the spark that the show needs to stay entertaining. Furthermore the music of the show is very adorable and fitting, and it gives the show the tone and character it needs. \\n\r\nSo overall Non Non Biyori gives the medium of anime a strong addition into the slice-of-life genre, and it is a show that can encourage other moe slice-of-life anime to properly use its setting and relationships to create an emotional core for the world presented in the show but also for the people watching.   \\n",

            "content": "As a slice of life anime, the story is not anything spectacular. The show merely follows the lives of some kids living in the countryside. Seeing as this is true, the story is only mediocre because it is not the focus of the show. For someone looking for a gripping, inspiring slice of life, this will probably disappoint. \r\nBut this show was not intended to have a stellar story, and it was still very enjoyable.\r\nThis show creates a very casual, comfortable atmosphere. The characters are generally relaxed, and the setting was depicted very well. It is easy to become immersed in the town the showis set in while watching. There are not any deep themes or hidden symbolic meanings that I could discern, but that does not mean the show was not good, it just did not have story depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style definitely enhanced some of the show's most amusing points. The appearance of the eyes is frequently changed to help represent various moods and build the atmosphere further. The eye artwork is definitely one of Non Non Biyori's strong points, and it is worth paying attention to while watching this show. There is nothing too spectacular nor bad about the art otherwise, but the little little things the artists do\u2014such as use the appearance of the eyes\u2014really add to the show's artistic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was another of the show's strong points. As I mentioned earlier, this show is very laid-back, and the soundtrack creates this feeling excellently. It has an original style\u2014not orchestral nor like rock 'n' roll.One track follows the tune of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" and it is only too fitting for this show. None of the humor is lewd, so the innocent humor of this show goes very well with the music used. On the other hand, none of the tracks will catch anyone's attention too well. They build the setting really well, but there are no tracks that are so good that I listen to them all the time. The OST's appeal comes from the way it builds the atmosphere through its original style. \\n\\n\r\nI do also like the show's OP too, but that might just be because I like nano.Ripe. The ED does use the voice actors, and it feels great hearing it after finishing an episode for all of the wonderful reasons that are too difficult to put into words. Natsumi and Renge's voice actors did a wonderful job. Natsumi's voice fit her character perfectly and added to the humor of all of her humorous scenes. Renge, being a first grader, was done flawlessly. These two voices were great in the ED as well and I absolutely loved the way they were done.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were wonderful. Again, they go very well with the show's overall image. Renge, the 1st grader, is hilarious; filled with all the innocence and curiosity of a normal 1st grader, but adds to the comedic aspect of the show as much as any other character. All of the characters have very fitting appearances, too. After watching a few episodes, it is easy to catch onto the jokes made based on different characters because they are developed so well. \\n\\n\r\nAlongside Renge, Komari is another hilarious character. She is the center of many jokes throughout the series. I might even suggest that watching the show for these two characters is worth it. Even if you were to watch it solely for these two, it would be hard not to be captured by Hotaru and Natsumi as well because they are all done so well\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of the show was great. For someone who has not watched a lot of anime or slice of life shows before, however, it will not be quite as enjoyable. Enjoyment does rely on the viewer's familiarity with Japanese culture to some extent. The characters are still enrolled in a school and are shown there somewhat often. Someone unfamiliar with the typical Japanese school setting will not find the show as enjoyable as someone who is familiar with it. When I watched this show, I had only watched a few school shows before and I still found it enjoyable. The jokes and scenes outside of the school setting are still prevalent and will make the show quite enjoyable even if you do not know all of the ins and outs of normal Japanese schools.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. The countryside setting was very original, and it was built perfectly for being something so rarely done. Even with the lack of story depth this show was enjoyable because, as I said earlier, that was not the point of the show. It is one of my personal favorite slice of life/comedy shows. It's great character cast and innocent jokes make it difficult to not enjoy this show. The laid back atmosphere built wonderfully by the music places viewers in a relaxing world where they can enjoy watching this show. Though the lack of depth and slow pace may come off as bad things, Non Non Biyori's originality negates any negative effect because it makes them work. Do not let these things keep you from watching this show; it's originality actually does set it apart very well.",

            "content": "Have you ever woken up one day, weary and drunk, realise you have to go to work or school, then just think: \"What would life be like in the countryside?\"\r\nNon Non Biyori left a special mark on my heart, something that rarely happens in most of the SOL animes I have watched so far. At first glance, it looks really simple; 4 girls wandering about together, enjoying their lives and nothing special really happens. Or rather, that was what I thought before I began the first episode. And the first episode is the exact definition of a hook.\r\nLet's break it down, shall we?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe plotof the anime focuses mainly on the everyday lives of the four girls, one of which is a Tokyo girl who is not used to the environment around her. If it was a normal show that had nothing special nor outstanding, I would have given it a 4. However, this show proved that it had what it took to go the extra mile, every episode giving yet a new conflict for the characters to solve and work around. Each new episode feels like a new adventure and personally, I felt part of the group and I enjoyed the sensation of the journey as much as they did. In terms of comedy, this show nailed it. Watching them screw up while on their journey really clogs your throat with amusement. Additionally, the cute faces (especially of Ren-chon and Komari-chan) never cease to make you smile. The comedy and the beautifully woven plot creates a heartwarming sensation burning in your heart after every episode, making you crave for the next.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nHonestly, one look at the thumbnail and I already knew that the art was going to be great. It did not let me down at all. The series depicts beautiful landscapes of a thousand hues, warming your heart and making you wish you were there as well. The character designs were straight forward, yet wonderful in their own way. Their look changes according to the mood of the situation, like when Komari's face looks even cuter when she gets mad. The animators did an amazing job on this. The character movements were simple that it was nearly flawless. Poor art makes an anime unbearable to watch, no matter how great the plot is, but this anime shows exactly what Silver Link was capable of.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime showcases 2 openings and 1 ending song, all of which were, in their own way, flawless. The first opening, Nanairo Biyori, displayed the childish yet fun theme of the show, catchy and adorable. The second opening, Kodama Kotodama, had a more country feel to it and my favourite soundtrack of the series. The fast pace of the song illustrates how fast time passes by in the story as well, not in a bad way of course. And Okaeri, the ending, was just cute and an amazing ending to an amazing episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nNon Non Biyori displayed a vast diversity of different personalities for each character. For example, Ren-chon's quick understanding of every situation and Sugar Lady's sweet and caring side, masked behind that strict facade. Ultimately, no character is stuck with only one stereotypical characteristic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nNo doubt, I loved it. Every second of it. According to Wittgenstein's Beetle-In-A-Box analogy, no matter how hard I try to describe the inordinate amount of happiness I felt while watching the show, no reader can understand its true potential without watching the show himself/herself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nAlright, now the things I did not like about the show such that it missed that little point to make this anime flawless. This may contain spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nI hated how they ended the story with a giant gaping hole, both in the main season and the OVA. How did life go on from there? It would be great if the last scene could feature one of the characters from like 3 years in the future, having a flashback on those times and sighing, before putting down the framed photograph and following the other 3 characters out for another exciting journey. The OVA ending was the most heartbreaking; what happened in Okinawa? Even the Repeat didn't cover that. But as time passes, I think that that gaping hole at the end of the series is what will keep me from forgetting Non Non Biyori.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing anime, a must-watch for heartwarming anime lovers and Slice of Life lovers.",

            "content": "Couple of weeks ago, one of my friends from another website recommended this piece of fiction called Non Non Biyori. Everyday he would tell me go try the anime and I was telling him ''I will, don't worry ok!''. Now this review is for him. Gobb thank you for this amazing anime, love ya .\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is very simple. You'll have your typical new transfer student introducing herself to her new teacher and friends. There's no plot. Just cute girls doing cute stuff. I'll talk more about the characters in the character section.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nYes! the art is a masterpiece. When I started watching thisanime. I thought I was watching fate unlimited blade works. Beautiful animation, characters and environment. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLet me give you a little bit of my background when it comes to sound. Most of the times I skip the opening and endings because they're nothing special. In this case, I never skipped the opening nor the ending. I watched the full 23 minutes in each episode. Is really that good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply well written in my opinion. Hotaru is your typical waifu, kind of shy, female character. There's nothing wrong with her except the fact that she's overly attached to her senpai komari.\\n\\n\r\nKomari and Natsumi have a pretty healthy relationship. They make jokes on each other from time to time, which I found hilarious. I was laughing in every episode that they were in with their jokes and how natsumi was teasing her big sister, even though natsumi on height is bigger than komari, but other than that, good sisters.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the best character of the show goes to Ren-chon. You simply cannot hate this character. There's no way! In every episode, I was hoping for her to get more panel time compared to hotaru and her friends. She's too cute and the things that she says are hilarious. I love her catchphrase (Nyan-pasu). It reminded me of rika from higurashi (Nipah!!). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast watching this anime. I wasn't eager to watch this show but Gobb told me to, with a gun aiming at my head to watch it yes/yes or he might kidnap my cat, and it turned out to be GREAT! \\n\\n\r\nThere was an episode that made me cry. Without spoiling here, I could relate to that character because It has happened to me in real life. So it made me sad because she was a little girl! She sat there for a minute and then started crying... manly tears were shed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nSorry but this anime is a masterpiece in my book and I highly recommend it to the people looking for an amazing slice of life. Cute moments and relatable characters. Superb soundtrack and 10/10 animation. Can't go wrong with this anime.",

My favorite thing about this anime are the sound effects of the background nature is outstanding. It really captures how the country sounds like, from birds, to the wind, even the sound of the crickets!\r\nAs for the characters, it's funny but not TOO funny. As someone in their early 20s, the responsibilities of life are starting to be thrown at me, I found that some of the things the characters say and do would even have you reminiscing being a child and howeasy and effortless it was being young.",
