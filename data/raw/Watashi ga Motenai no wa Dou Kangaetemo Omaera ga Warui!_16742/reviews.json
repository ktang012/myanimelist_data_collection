            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nThere is a scene in Watamote where the main character, Tomoko, experiences what she believes to be public molestation. She panics, unable to even breathe or call for help. The train suddenly stops, and the passengers begin to take their leave. Tomoko then realizes that the object pressing against her is simply a bamboo sword belonging to the girl behind her. After much public embarrassment, she finally breaks free, and moves on to yet another miserable day of her life. \r\nTo say that Watamote is an uncomfortable anime would be an understatement. Every minute involves Tomoko failing at something in the most awkward wayimaginable, to the point where you can't help but pity the poor girl. It's not even amusing. It's just depressing.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is a high school girl that simply wants to be liked by her peers. She wants to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex. She is so lonely and socially inept that even hearing a \"goodbye\" from a classmate is seen as a massive success. Her younger brother doesn't care about her problems, her parents think she's a pathetic pervert, and her only friend (who she rarely even sees) is oblivious to Tomoko's blatant emotional issues. She is alone with nobody to help. \\n\\n\r\nDoes she bring some of these problems upon herself? Maybe. Does she try too hard to be somebody that she's not? Definitely. But who can blame her? The only time she had anything even remotely resembling a normal life was when she was a toddler. Of course she's angry. Of course she's fed-up with her lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the source material which presents itself entirely as a gag manga, the anime teases us with signs that Tomoko might actually be changing for the better. But nothing ever does change. She squanders all her opportunities, leaving both her and the audience with a bitter sense of hopelessness. What's the point in enduring so many embarrassing scenes when there is no payoff at the end? Are we meant to be masochists? \\n\\n\r\nThe humor of Watamote is akin to kicking a kitten, and worse - a kitten that you sympathize with. It's a punchline where there is no punchline. The goal is make us laugh at somebody in a pitiable situation, to feel happy that our lives are not quite as bad as Tomoko's. Is that comedy? Is that entertainment? For others, perhaps, but all it did for me was bring back awful memories and remind me of everything wrong with teenagers. Some scenes were so uncomfortable that I had to take a break or avert my eyes for a few moments. That's not what a comedy is supposed to do. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes can be quite funny, though. If you've ever listened to porn or something equally embarrassing on your computer, only to realize that the headphones weren't actually plugged in, well, Watamote will remind you of such times. The best moments are when the humor is restrained and situational. The dialogue between Tomoko and her brother is also well-written and reminiscent of most actual brother-sister relationships; I just wish that there was more of him. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also very easy to relate to Tomoko's situation if you've ever dealt with social anxiety. Sure, her feelings are blatantly exaggerated for comedic effect, but the way people act around her is very much real. Teenagers love to gossip. They love to ignore and exclude anybody that isn't a part of their group. Watamote hits this fact home, reminding us just how idealized high school life is in anime. It is the opposite of escapism. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation quality, Watamote is an above-average anime. Each scene is made even more depressing by the dark, often blue-and-grey color scheme. The animation is consistent (though there isn't much of it) and, for once, a shut-in character does not look like a supermodel. Tomoko looks disheveled, tired, and unclean. As she should. The animators don't even hold back on making some scenes look utterly repulsive (including a failed experiment with make-up, and a colony of ants making their home in Tomoko's hair... ugh). There's definitely some talent here, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is more of a mixed bag. Kitta Izumi does a fantastic job of voicing Tomoko's character, but the background music is barely noticeable and the opening is some mixture of awful screamo and generic J-Pop. It's a cacophony that I never wanted to sit through more than once (although I'm sure that I'm in the minority). At least the ending sequence sounds more in line with the tone of the series: delightfully disgusting, and cute all the same. \\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, Watamote should be commended for daring to be different. This is not your ordinary anime. If it was an ordinary anime, Tomoko would be male and she would have a harem in love with her for some inexplicable reason. There is none of that. Watamote wastes no time on romanticizing the high school life, and instead portrays it for what is in reality. Few anime out there have had the courage to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all the awful, depressing things we see happen to Tomoko, what do we get for it at the end? Nothing but a sad glimpse of a girl desperately clinging to the hope that some day, she might attain a normal person's happiness. A dream that we all know will never be fulfilled.",

            "content": "WataMote is a painful story.  That's the easiest way to describe it.  It's the painful story of a painfully anti-social girl's painful life.  There are very large pros to having a story like this, but there are also huge cons that can come with it.  WataMote is no exception, it's amazing but also majorly flawed.  So why did I give it a 9?  Because the flaws with stories like this is that they are completely hit or miss, there's no in between.  For me it was a home run, but it's very understandable that it can be astrike out.\\n\\n\r\nBaseball metaphors aside, let's get into why WataMote is good and why it's bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's relatable.  The strongest thing that painful stories have is that people who have felt similar pain can relate to the main character, when that occurs a person can easily fall in love with a story.  If you're someone that is anti-social, socially awkward, shy, or can't express yourself well then you'll find Tomoko practically reading your mind at several points.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about people who aren't like that?  What of you folks who can easily talk with people, have tons of friends and go out and have fun regularly?  What you end up with is a gruelingly torturing story of a sad girl futilely attempting to make friends.  When you see the things in the story that happen to Tomoko, you don't go \"It's so true!\" You go \"Oh, my god that's so sad.  Poor Tomoko.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet's put it this way.  While you watch you might think, \"When is someone just gonna go up and try to become friends with her?\"  In a fluffy story about friendship that would happen.  But this is a realistic story about a loner, that person who wants to become her friend doesn't exist, in the story or real life.  If you're thinking \"That's terrible.\"  Then you probably won't like WataMote.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the story objectively also opens some flaws to you.  There is almost no plot.  The entire story is just the life of Tomoko, period.  The pace is slow and and the progression is very lifelike, AKA nonexistent.  There is a notable amount of repetition and things can eventually become stale.  To a person who's experienced similar pain however, these issues are nearly invisible because of how close to life it is.  But that doesn't excuse that the issues exist.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting thing about WataMote is that the only true character is Tomoko.  There are only two other notable characters and even they are very minor to things.  When this show says it's about a girl with no friends it means it.  The whole story revolves around Tomoko observing the world around her and making commentaries, trying to become popular, and then reverting back to her NEET state in recovery from the pain.  Being that everything is about her and her alone, the story is very Me VS The World, which some can enjoy but a lot of people can easily find so much time spent with just one character suffocating.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how you look at it however, Tomoko is a brilliant character.  She is realistic at scary levels.  She has no friends, but wants to make some.  So then why does she spend all day cooped up in her room?  Why does she watch what her classmates do in disgust?  It's because that's how she has developed to survive.  The only way to make it okay to not have friends subconsciously is to hate them, yet she consciously still wants friends.  She wants to go out and have fun, but subconsciously she knows that only pain awaits outside her room.  Tomoko is absurdly lifelike and likable.\\n\\n\r\nA big part of her character is that no matter what happens.  No matter how likable she is, she is never cute or moe in any way which is so important for this show to make her relatable.  Several times I got see absorbed into Tomoko's character that I started to fantasize about nice things happening to her, which is exactly what she does to get her spirits up.  Your spirits get lowered to the same level as hers as she connects to you.  I didn't want to refer to her as Tomoko as I watched, I wanted to call her Watashi(Me).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of WataMote is excellent.  Kitta Izumi does a brilliant job as Tomoko.  Her voice is unique, fitting, and enjoyable.  The opening  is fantastic in my opinion.  It takes a very different direction than typical openings by being a serious dramatization of Tomoko's desire to break out of her recluse nature.  The ending in contrast shows the representation of Tomoko's inner awareness that she can't break out of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also notable.  It's simple but also very expressive and erratic at many points.  Tomoko is a NEET and she looks the part.\\n\\n\r\nSo with what I've said it might seem like WataMote is the a massively depressing story, that's not entirely wrong.  The way that it manages to keep things lighthearted is by always trying to make the depressing let downs, failures, and truly pitiful successes comedic.  It's a dark humor, it's funny how much Tomoko is beat down, not because I like watching girls in pain but because I understand her pain.  And when they finally portray Tomoko's pain as pain instead of dark humor it really resonates with you.  But only if you can stomach watching a really pitiful girl.  The extreme darkness of the humor can easily turn a lot of people off.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I have to say about WataMote is that a lot of other people, including the show itself, claim that the story is a trivial one that eventually leads to nothing.  Throughout the whole thing there is pain, pain, and more pain.  Where's the payoff?  There isn't any.  The story is too realistic to offer something like payoff.  However I don't believe at all that the Tomoko at the beginning of the story is the same one at the end of it.  WataMote has one of those endings that when you first see it it seems like nothing, but if you give it another good hard look you can see that Tomoko changes a lot at the end.  To me, the ending is the payoff of everything and it is massive payoff.  It's a great and very realisstic ending.  But it's not easy to see the payoff, only people who understand can probably see it, but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch WataMote?  In most cases an anime scored with a 9 might be an \"Absolutely\".  Not here.  As a matter of fact, I think most people would probably not like WataMote.  I think that only those quiet, anti-social, loners are the people who would praise WataMote the same way I do.  But all of you sociables probably want to avoid this one.  You might think you can sympathize with Tomoko, but sympathy won't carry you enough to ignore the flaws the same way relating to her can.",

            "content": "WATAMOTE -No matter how I look at it, It's you guys fault I'm not popular- is a comedy aimed straight at dysfunctional geeks, or former dysfunctional geeks, who can laugh at their own faults and take them with a grain of salt. Its gallows humor centers around a socially inept mess of a protagonist who goes through life repeating the cycle of self-embarrassment and loneliness while learning nothing from it, and garnished with anime and pop culture references and parodies. It's a show that hits painfully close to home for anyone who has social anxieties, yet playful enough that it remains morbidly funny rather thanbecoming straight-up depressing, most of the time at least. It's also pretty blunt about who's really at fault for all the main character's problems.\\n\\n\r\nOur social misfit of a protagonist is Tomoko, an unkempt antisocial teenager entering her first year of high school. Despite having difficulty with talking to the opposite sex and having hardly any friends in middle school, Tomoko convinces herself that she will become instantly popular after her high school debut. It goes without saying that this isn't the case. Instead, she ends up brooding, having odd fantasies, and lamenting the fact she isn't popular. She spends her days fading into the scenery and going unnoticed by her fellow students, except for her occasional bouts of awkwardness; her days off school are usually spent cooped up in her room. Still, she's determined to gain popularity among her peers, even if she has absolutely no clue how to go about accomplishing that goal. Cringe inducing awkwardness and hilarity ensue.\\n\\n\r\nMajority of the show's humor comes from Tomoko's breathtaking ineptness. Not only does she have trouble talking to people, she has no sense of how to handle social situations at all. On top of that, she's also pessimistic and has a really dirty mind. Consequently, she constantly misinterprets even the simplest of interactions and blows them out of proportion; sometimes putting a sexual twist on them. A single kind gesture from a boy sends her into hilariously ludicrous fantasies of that boy having having a crush on her and becoming her boyfriend, even if there isn't a single indignation that he is actually interested in her. She comes up with half-baked ideas how to get noticed by her classmates which either go unnoticed or cause her embarrassment, even as she has overblown daydreams of becoming the most popular girl in class. She even botches an attempt to impress her visiting younger cousin, who had actually admired Tomoko until this particular visit. It would be depressing (actually, it still sort of is) if it wasn't for how clearly deluded Tomoko is (she takes social ques from anime), and the show's unhinged presentation of her delusional fantasies and social ineptitude.\\n\\n\r\nThe irony in this is, despite coming up with harebrained ideas to get her classmates' attentions, Tomoko rarely tries to interact with them normally. Instead of actually attempting to get acquainted with her fellow students, she just mopes around and daydreams about having friends. Of course, this is partly due to shyness, but Tomoko actively avoids interacting with people. She's also jealous, and even a bit spiteful, towards people more popular than her. Tomoko's loneliness is something she brings upon herself, if even just partly. Of course, she's unaware of this; propelling the show's morbid laughs as she runs around in circles.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you may have noticed Tomoko is the only character I've mentioned so far. This is because she is very much the essence of the show; she is horribly pathetic and self-centered and incredibly counter-productive, yet somehow surprisingly sympathetic. Her desire to become popular, warped as it is, comes from a genuine place. Beneath her unkempt appearance and unsocial demeanor, she's a confused teenager looking for someone to connect with. As funny as her misfortunes can be, and they can be pretty damn hilarious, there's an underline melancholy to them. This resonate strong for anyone who has had crippling social anxieties like Tomoko. What makes WATAMOTE a breath of fresh air is that it is able to spin these negative feelings into something fun to watch. The show's manic energy and countless silly references to other anime (K-ON, Fist of the North Star, and Another just to name a few), which usually take form in Tomoko's delusions, keep the humor from being overwhelmingly bleak... most of the time, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show have significantly less attention, which isn't surprising given the nature of the show, but add extra flavor to the show as they interact with Tomoko. In complete opposition to Tomoko's high school experience, her best friend from middle school Yuu (her only friend, really) has made a full transformation from quiet shy girl to a trendy, fashionable girl. Unlike our protagonist, she's friendly and sociable and actually pretty sweet; even with her new found popularity she makes time for her unsociable middle-school friend whenever she can. It's rather funny to see the striking contrast of the separate paths the two took after middle school. There's also Tomoko's younger brother, who always seems to be at the butt of Tomoko's shenanigans at home. Their vague animosity towards each other mirrors that of an actual sibling relationship, something that is oddly rare in anime. Late in the series, there's also a character that gives Tomoko a much needed hug.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Shin Oonuma has a very busy visual style, constantly throwing colorful and weird imagery into scenes; a habit that has been unnecessary in some of his previous works. This fits WATAMOTE like a glove, however. Tomoko has a very skewed outlook on life and an equally as overactive imagination; Oonuma's manic direction does wonders to illustrate this. Sometimes this comes in little touches like many of the characters having minimal detail in their designs, or Tomoko slowly becoming transparent and fading into the background. Other times it takes form in delirious spectacles, such as any of Tomoko's ludicrous fantasies. Also adding the unhinged visual design is the oddly angled lighting and color schemes and visual windows into Tomoko's thoughts. Tomoko's character design itself is cute in a dirty abandoned puppy kind of way; giving her some major icon power. You get the feeling that she would look pretty good if she actually took care of herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is on the zany side. It's reminiscent the usual light music used in high school comedy anime, but with a distinct oddness to it that works well with the visual design. The real attention catcher, however, are the show's opening and ending themes. The show has several different ending themes; all of which are both fun to listen to, and a little crazy. The main ending theme is preformed by Tomoko's seiyuu, Izumi Kitta (who does an incredibly job in the role), and fits the character perfectly. The opening theme is a blast of hard-rocking energy that is accompanied by visuals that encapsulate the show's themes and change slightly as the show continues. It is easily one of the best anime openers in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nWATAMOTE doesn't live to the likes of Welcome to the NHK or The Tatami Galaxy, which feature similarly dissatisfied protagonists, because Tomoko ultimately doesn't grow or develop much at all by the end. The show itself says that \"her story doesn't really matter\". However, perhaps because of this irreverence, the show is gigantically entertaining. While social anxieties are certainly a serious issue, there is something refreshing about having a show that centers around them not take itself seriously. The show isn't trivializing such anxieties or even making fun of them. It's simply inviting the viewers to laugh them off.",

            "content": "Before you decide to watch this show, make sure you do the following:\r\nFirst, lock your windows, close the blinds, and make sure you're in an isolated location (preferably soundproof). Also, have plenty of supply of water ready. Oh and don't forget some cough medicine. Now you're probably asking yourself, \u201cwhy??\u201d The answer is simple:\r\nYou're going to be laughing so damn hard in this series like you've never ever before.\r\nWatamote, aka No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys\u2019 Fault I'm Not Popular!, is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Tanigawa Nico. The series chronicles the lifeof an antisocial girl named Tomoko Kuroki. It depicts the every day life of this young girl as she finally becomes a high school student. The problem? She is literally an otaku with no social experience with no real friends, much less a boyfriend. Well, now that might be something that not any of us wants to be in the shoes of but for Tomoko, it's what she has to go through every single day of her life.\\n\\n\r\nFor Tomoko, she is what represents the antithesis of a high school girl. While most girls in high school already have friends and are looking forward to the dating cycle, Tomoko is still in the baby stage of her making a real friend. (a boyfriend would obviously be better but I think that might be out of her league for now) Tomoko has always being a shy girl throughout her childhood and has a problem of getting along with others socially. In fact, her social skills are so below average that through flashbacks, we see she has only made three actual \u201cconversations\u201d with her peers. But hey, it's high school so the opportunity to shine is now right? WRONG. For Tomoko, it doesn't seem like much has progressed. She is still stuck as an antisocial girl with zero experience in socializing. She often has thoughts in her head too that are filled with delusions about others. For instance, she often fantasizes what it would be like if she really was popular. These delusions expands on her being the queen, majesty, or some sort of celebrity in her own mind. Other times, she pictures herself in a world of her own where she is the ruler and the subjects are those 'popular kids'. Unfortunately, she often mixes the wrong way between her fictions and reality. These usually result in consequences...mostly getting herself embarrassed or humiliated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat impresses me most about her character is that Tomoko is very relatable. In fact, most of her life situations can be traced to our own childhoods. In fact, some of you reading this might be one of those folks who were once antisocial yourself. There's a line though between being antisocial or just a nutcase. In Watamote, Tomoko takes it to the extremes through her behavior. She has a love for BL games, often gets ideas from the manga/anime she is in love with, and always seems to say or do the wrong things at the wrong time. (mostly anyways) Furthermore, Tomoko seems to have a perverted mind as well as she fantasizes about genders of both sexes. In particular, her 'friend' Yui is a target of those  perverted thoughts as she plays strange imaginations in her head. \\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a slice of life format so don't expect any form of arc going on. What you should expect though is Tomoko's progression as she tries to climb out of her shell in terms of being the antisocial kid. She doesn't have any real friend and seems like High School isn't getting any better. In fact, her vow to become more popular is played as parodies with each of her attempts. These usually are plans played in her head that often doesn't seem to go the way she wants to. Tomoko's reliance on the knowledge she gets from anime, manga, and in the otome game world doesn't help her at all. Although it's played as a parody most of the time, there are moments where we may also feel sorry for her. Why? Perhaps it's because we might have been in the same situation before. In fact, there is probably one moment in life where you feel like you just can't succeed in something no matter how hard you try. In the end, you realize it might all be pointless. For Tomoko Kuroki, it's something she has dealt with many times in her life. \u201cWhat's the point?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTomoko's relation with her family is surprisingly quite realistic; at least at first glance. She has caring parents whom often cares for her daughter despite them not knowing of her way of life. Tomoko's younger brother Tomoki Kuroki is also portrayed as being just what a younger brother might be like in the real world \u2013 impatient, reserved, and often brutally honest. Throughout the series, we clearly see that the two of them behaves like siblings because of the way the argue. Some of these are based off of normal norms while other times are related to almost no reason. Regardless, it's realistic in my point of view because siblings always gets into fights no matter what. In fact, if you had a sibling, wasn't there at least one time where the two of you disagreed over something? (even if it's completely pointless?)\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we later meet another character who served as an 'old friend' of Tomoko. Unlike Tomoko though, she significantly changed not only physically but also in terms of her personality. She represents what Tomoko is not \u2013 pretty, cheerful, and sociable. It's sad to see Tomoko being compared to such a person throughout the series because the gap in their differences. Furthermore, she seems to have accomplished a goal in her life that has been an obstacle that Tomoko tried to overcome all this time. Sometimes, you just have to feel sorry for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea and originality of Watamote isn't as fresh as some people might think though. Recent series such as My Romantic Comedy SNAFU also depicts a young boy with delusions and being antisoical while being acquittance with a beauty. Other series such as Welcome to the NHK and The World God Only Knows also depicts the otaku culture with an antisocial character and being unpopular with their peers. The highlight to Watamote though is that Tomoko is an extreme case but also struggles to overcome her obstacles in a more humorous way. The way Tomoko is portrayed often shows that she is stuck in a labyrinth of her own problems. There seems to be no way out for her because of various reasons. These reasons are often humorous but if we take them to the real life world, it can be a serious problem. Regardless, I find Watamote and its portrayal of Tomoko's character to be very entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of the series are also the highlights. There are references being made to pop culture as well as other popular anime/manga series. Sometimes though, I feel like the show is trying a bit hard or more repetitive than it should be. Tomoko's quest to become more popular in high school might also frustrate viewers especially those who wants her to succeed. Then finally, Watamote might also be a painful watch especially for those who has truly been in Tomoko's shoes before. It makes some of us look back and tell ourselves, \u201cwow, I think I've been there before..just look at me now\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWatamote's artwork overall is painted with a simple style. Tomoko's character is probably the most noticeable. The way she looks isn't what some people might call 'attractive'. Rather, she is designed in the way an antisocial kid might be like. Her long hair, bagged eyes, and way she dresses shows that she isn't the typical valley girl. In fact, she doesn't use makeup or spent hours doing her hair in the morning. Silver Link adapts the manga well for the visuals just the way it ought to be \u2013 straight forward and simple. \\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack goes, Watamote's OP song, Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui by Konomi Suzuki n' Kiba of Akiba is extremely noticeable with its combination of rock and metal cords. Along with the strange appeal to her character, the song depicts Tomoko as a kid who doesn't fit with the popular crowds. The OST of the show is pleasant and often times plays noticeable tones of its soundtrack during certain scenes. These usually include moments when Tomoko gets caught up in awkward moments. The ED contains several different styles but all of them are portrayed as humorous and awkward. Finally, I would like to give praise to Tomoko's VA Kitta Izumi for her role in this series. Her voice as Tomoko truly shows that she is antisocial girl with no social skills and troubling delusions. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this show is one hell of a fun ride. I forgot the amount of times I had to screenshot those hilarious moments involving Tomoko. It brings about the humor of what an antisocial girl might be like in the case of Tomoko. Although the series does take it a bit to the extreme at times, I find it funny to watch because it pokes fun at the idea. In fact, the idea of being antisocial is often portrayed as a serious consequence. And indeed it is but in Watamote, the show gives off more of a humorous experience in the eyes and shoes of Tomoko. It's not a good thing to be antisocial or delusional but this show portrays it in such a way that you can't sometimes help but laugh. (at least I did) I hope you get a good laugh from this series as well. High school experiences might not be something we all enjoyed in our lives but it's certainly an important part of our memories. For Tomoko, that might not be appealing but this series sure was.",

            "content": "What happened? Watamote was a series about this socially retarded girl who came across with some social situations and acted retarded. Then what happened? This same thing over and over. Social situation, then retardation. This happened few times, then few times again and in the end few times happened few times too many, and that is what happened. \r\nMain points where this anime fails are pacing, character development and plot. 1-cour series can achieve a lot, but Watamote didn't even try to get anywhere. Many criticize Slice of Life series for being pointless, even state that Slice of Life is meant to be pointless, butin Watamote's case, it's mainly just waste of potential. Watamote had the key elements to be the NHK with OreImo funfun, but someone thought it would be cool to start repeating the same stone age joke till nausea, and it sure was. (Stone age and nausea, not funfun).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are meeting my picture of laziness. Kuroko is pathetic, a no-life loser and more importantly, a characters which is easy to develop in whatever direction. ... NOPE. Let's have a character who is the same person always, and an annoying one too! This formula works in fighting tournament shonen, but not here. Never here. Her brother reminds me of an alpaca. Always that stupid fucking face. By alpaca I mean that one guy from Twilight. There is other character too, but they won't matter, except that one senpai girl from the last episodes. She is interesting, why won't they make an anime about her instead of this little fucker? \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation and art, Watamote does a good job not being like all the other recent school series, so it passes. If we ignore the glorious op, the music is forgettable. Same thing with voice acting when ignoring her (you know, her) squeaking voices. Nothing impressive nor disappointing in the production, just the typical neutral nothing.",

            "content": "Now I want to preface this by saying I'm not strictly reviewing the series. I find it hard coming from my perspective to be able to objectively rate the show overall. This is because I believe that whether you like or dislike this show heavily depends on how much you can relate to the main character, therefore your mileage my vary.\r\n**The impressions I give do contain some minor spoilers however I do not believe they effect your enjoyment of the show**\r\nThe reason I really like Watamote is because it takes a particularly dark and depressing condition and gives it a light-hearted twist. See many peopleseem to misinterpret Tomoko (the MC) as being introverted, however I have to respectfully disagree. Being introverted does not mean that one is socially inept, as Tomoko is. Instead it means that the introverted person in question is energized by doing things by themselves but are quickly tired when participating in things involving a group. While it can be somewhat true that those who prefer to spend time by themselves are not as socially able as extroverts, it is not the 'default' for an introvert to be bad at conversations or unable to recognize social ques.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has experience with social anxiety in the past I can tell you that Tomoko most certainly suffers from social anxiety herself based on her actions throughout the series. Indeed her main goal through the show is to have lots of friends and be the interest of all the boys. If she was truly an introvert this would be in conflict with the idea that she wants to be the center of attention and be at the social peak of the high school she goes to. I feel like this needed to be explained because some dislike towards this show comes from people perceiving her as being an introvert and then subsequently stating that her behavior is unrealistic and exaggerated because 'introverts aren't like that'. Your enjoyment of the show will be enhanced if you can recognize that she has social anxiety, she is not introverted. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind I want to say just how accurately the show depicts social anxiety at it's worst. Tomoko frequently struggles to even say 'Hello' or 'Goodbye' to any of the characters in the show despite them actually being more than willing to interact with her. This really is an accurate representation in my opinion. For someone with social anxiety just saying things as simple as hello and good morning are monumental tasks. Since I can relate to this it is one of the main reasons that Watamote resonates so much with me. See Watamote takes this experience and others like it and utilizes the animation and sound to make it comedic, so that I can sit back and watch this show and laugh at all the unfortunate things that happen to Tomoko. It makes it so I can laugh at my own experiences and that really is relieving. It's nice to see such a condition portrayed in anime and not instantly be depressed by it which is a challenging thing for an anime to achieve and it adds a whole new level of appreciation for me towards Watamote and what it does. On one hand it gives an oddly realistic and mature look into the life of someone with social anxiety while simultaneously parodying it, which is fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this I really loved the fact that Watamote did not show Tomoko overcoming her social anxiety. One major criticism held against the show is that it does not have an overarching plot and the status quo that is set in episode 1 is still there by episode 12. While a series being too episodic is a valid complaint with many anime shows in recent years, I feel that Watamote is one of those anime that actually really benefits from being episodic. See social anxiety is not something that can simply be overcome in the period of a school term, shyness maybe, but social anxiety no. I feel like if Watamote had shown serious progression or even Tomoko outright beating her condition then it would have been unrealistic and immersion breaking. So for that I commend Watamote for not going down the idealistic route and instead sticking with the 'status quo' it portrays of Tomokos life. It really adds to my enjoyment of the show on the whole. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier your enjoyment of this show may heavily depend on how much you can relate to the experiences of Tomoko. If you can, then I highly recommend this show for you. If you can't, then you may still like it for its charming animation, good use of sound and quality 'cringe' humor. Equally however you may dislike watching a show that is basically about someone who can never do things right and is constantly messing up because of her warped view on events surrounding her. It's certainly not the best anime out there nor my favorite but to me it really had an emotional impact unlike any other anime I've watched making it worth noting for any anime fan.",

            "content": "I was all over this series when it first aired. Coming from someone who was in similar positions with Tomoko; its depiction of social reclusion and anxiety was perfect.  Even with a blatantly cheap budget, the series is able to vividly and impeccably flesh out Tomoko\u2019s character. Props to director Shin Oonuma as she makes the best out of her limited budget to use creative, well-directed visual tricks, that aren\u2019t simply used for show, but to further our understanding on Tomoko.\r\nAnother great factor about this series is that when it comes to depicting Tomoko, it takes us into her life without trying to conformthe viewer to a certain mindset. All the humor that stemmed from Tomoko\u2019s situations were funny, but in a cringe-worthily pragmatic manner rather than in a form of mean-spiritedness. And all those serious scenes of Tomoko were just to reflect on the quiet and heartbreaking moments of her instead of simply trying to force the viewers to sympathize with Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what many people claim, you don\u2019t have to have to relate with the female lead to enjoy Watamote. Yeah, it has its clever references to certain anime that casual viewers of anime won\u2019t get, but overall Watamote presents itself in a manner that anyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, I was thoroughly impressed with Watamote at the start. The problem, as the series progresses, is that Tomoko\u2019s charm began to fade. I understand that the message the series conveys isn\u2019t about overcoming social anxiety, but how for many, it\u2019s a serious issue that may never be overcome. And though I like that message, it doesn\u2019t translate well into something I want to see for 12 episodes. Watching Tomoko monologue about her everyday life, even with all the novel and different situations she gets herself into, became stale. Even if I could still relate to Tomoko, it just wasn\u2019t of interest to keep watching and it didn\u2019t help that there was no firm direction or hint of what the series wanted to achieve in the end,\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, Tomoko isn\u2019t the lone character in the whole series, there are side characters like her only friend Yuu, her brother and a couple of other characters that make an occasional appearance. Yes, whether it\u2019s Tomoko trying to mirror what\u2019s popular or bickering with her older brother, Watamote is at its best with those moments and not when Tomoko\u2019s alone in her room. Because quite frankly, the show started feeling oddly empty and that didn\u2019t rub me the right way.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 Non-existent, it\u2019s episodic story-telling didn\u2019t work for me and there\u2019s no set direction of where it exactly wants to go\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 Tomoko is a fantastically depicted recluse, but her development is quite static. Side characters are great and bring out the best of the series, but lack more show time\\n\\n\r\nSetting \u2013 Its themes of recluse and social anxiety are well presented, but don\u2019t translate well into a vastly entertaining series\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values \u2013 Cheap, but is well made use of with incredibly creative and well-directed visual tricks\\n\\n\r\nDo I Recommend?:  Overall, I enjoyed Watamote for how it depicted a social recluse and I certainly enjoyed Tomoko\u2019s interactions with the real world, but in the end - with static development, scenes of monologue that felt empty and no real sense of direction - it was just another episodic comedy that didn\u2019t leave much of an impact on me. I commend the series for being open to viewers whether or not they relate to Tomoko\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s a very black and white series for the ones that do. You\u2019re either captivated by it or completely turned off by it. \\n",

            "content": "~No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys Fault This Review Is Not Popular!~\r\nBut either way it doesn't really matter since this show is here to accommodate for that. On the surface, the Watamote series follows the everyday life of our fellow heroine Tomoko Kuroki as she tries her hardest to become popular with her new high school life. With it, we are presented with everyday situations and how Tomoko deals with these events. \r\nMany factors such as the art and sound help to present these events in a comedic tone. You'll come across many references from anime today and a couple yearsback, and these references serve to emphasize on the theme of being unpopular. In addition, the soundtrack is filled with fun and high-spirited tunes that don't take it self too seriously and presents the mood that Tomoko is currently in. Not only that, but there are surprises to see within this soundtrack which I best should not mention. Furthermore, Kitta, Izumi really shines in her role as Tomoko, she is able to portray a voice that sounds crazy yet desperate but when it comes time for Tomoko to socialize with other characters, Izumi really stands out with her awkwardness. \\n\\n\r\nAs you watch this show, many of you will come to realize just how much Tomoko is like us. When I finished watching, I was left asking \"Did they make an anime based on my life?\"; the show's sense of humor could hit hard at home for many, which would either leave many cringing or leave you laughing at just how much you could relate to it. Tomoko is a dimensional character because of this, you'll feel her pain when things don't go her way or be happy when something good actually happens for her, and some of you may even despise her for the way she acts. But in general, without Tomoko, this show just wouldn't be the same at all. As for the supporting cast, they all fit into the story of Watamote without them feeling out of place. A notable character to highlight would have to Tomoki, he is like the opposite of Tomoko and when those two are together, the situations could get very funny or very painful. \\n\\n\r\nAt the heart, this show shouldn't be taken seriously, although many of us have experienced or still are experiencing the type of life that Tomoko has, it is meant to be taken in a humorous fashion, which could put off many. But if you're willing to look past that, then I assure you that Watamote is worth the watch, not every day would you be able to find a show as popular as this, no pun intended.",

            "content": "If you saw someone who is regularly alone, would you talk to or try to befriend him/her? Are you or did you used to be that lonely person? Or do you pity those type of people and tend to ignore them?\r\nWatamote is designed to give the viewer a taste of the daily life of such a person with an excellent mixture of reality and comedy. Prepare to enter the world of an introverted, socially inept girl named Tomoko, who desperately wishes to become popular and get a boyfriend. Depending on the person, Watamote can appear depressing, funny, or ridiculous. It may be difficult to laughat someone else\u2019s misfortunes and embarrassment regardless of whether or not it is fictionalized. However, it can draw several emotions for those who can relate. It gives you an opportunity to laugh at your own faults or sympathize with the character as she experiences loneliness and launch laughable schemes to get noticed.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9) / Character (9)\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is an Otaku who spends most of her time in the fantasy world. She visualizes her life being as glamorous as in her virtual dating games or favorite anime. However, she learns that popularity is not so easy to gain in high school. She survived middle school with one geeky best friend, but she must start from scratch as she attends school with complete strangers.\\n\\n\r\nThe reality and comedy is executed excellently as the anime follows Tomoko\u2019s daily life in social isolation. Her awkwardness and nervousness is what brings forth the comedy, because her attempts at popularity are kind of weird and hilarious. Tomoko tries to become more feminine and attractive to boys by changing her appearance, copying actions from anime protagonists, etc. Some scenes were exaggerated to create laughter. Tomoko\u2019s sudden reactions to certain occurrences, including being approached by a hot guy, are honest and comical.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who suffers from social anxiety disorder, Tomoko struggles to talk to strangers. Whether it is a simple hello/goodbye or ordering fast food, she speaks softly and stutters as if it\u2019s a pain. She shies away from several opportunities that could gain her a friend or improve her social skills. One part of the comedy comes from Tomoko bugging Tomoki (her popular soccer brother) to converse with her until she gets a boyfriend. The conversations are amusing with the weird subjects (e.g. Tomoko asking if he gets quickies from his female coach) and Tomoki showing his annoyance and disgust.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko\u2019s inner monologues greatly expresses her character. They involve honest feelings from cursing the happy people of the world or inspiring herself to try harder to socialize the next day. Tomoko\u2019s view of the world is that of a sim dating game or anime, causing her to have strange and inaccurate assumptions about the real world. Her time in the virtual world causes her to have perverted thoughts of what it\u2019s like to have a boyfriend. There are two or three ecchi scenes as Tomoko does both inner and outer research on how to become more feminine.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko slightly improves socially towards the end, receiving a little recognition from schoolmates. The ending is hopeful but disappointing for those who will expect immediate progress. It is yet another anime that urges you to continue the story with the manga because of its incomplete ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development goes at a steady pace for a shut-in like Tomoko, which is the reason for the incomplete ending. A faster pace would make the story unrealistic, since popularity cannot happen overnight. Supporting characters give a great contribution to Tomoko\u2019s development as she tries to gain self-confidence and hope for the future. Although the series strictly follows Tomoko, it goes inside the head of other characters and tells their thoughts of Tomoko. Some quotes from them are either funny or sympathetic. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8) / Sound (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are both memorable, underlining the anime\u2019s moody atmosphere. The animation is highly responsible for bringing out the comedy by creating an over-exaggeration of awkward scenes. Visuals portrays Tomoko\u2019s hallucinations and embarrassment with vivid colors, and her facial expressions constantly distorts to match her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was distinctly good. Tomoko is drawn exactly like an unappealing emo character with dark circles under eyes, long black hair, and plain clothes. Other characters\u2019 appearances are suitable for their nature. There are gray, colorless figures to express depression and loneliness in Tomoko\u2019s surroundings. Characters sometimes have faces with no eyes. Background designs are colorful and well-drawn. There are sometimes aerial views of a setting (e.g. inside a restaurant). Settings are diverse and brings excitement to the series, because each setting adds yet another incident to Tomoko\u2019s life.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is a heavy metal song that\u2019s named after the anime itself, and the lyrics of \"Watamote\" describe Tomoko\u2019s character: \u201cI won\u2019t accept this world until I make it to a future where I\u2019m popular.\u201d There are five ending songs throughout Watamote, and they all match the moods to the ending of each episode. Background music sounds like a video game, so it's not that special. The VAs were very good and fit each character\u2019s personality. Izumi Kitta (voice of Tomoko) did an excellent job expressing Tomoko\u2019s nervousness throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) \\n\\n\r\nWatamote is one of the best slice of life comedies I have ever watched. I sympathized with Tomoko on several occasions and found her breakdowns funny most of the time. The animation and supporting characters brought excitement to the series by highlighting the different emotions (sadness, laughter) of the anime. The pacing also demonstrated hope for Tomoko. I was disappointed with the ending, but I loved it so much that I moved onto the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Watamote delivers a perfect combination of reality and comedy. It takes you on a ride through the life of a socially inept girl whose primary goal is to become popular. Sympathize with Tomoko as she goes through loneliness. Enjoy (and laugh) at her several crazy schemes to get people to notice her. \\n\\n\r\nTip: Watch the entire episode and enjoy the ED. After the credits, Tomoko and Tomoki converse for a few seconds about the main topic related to the next episode.",

            "content": "I simply wanted to say that Watamote is one of the most depressing anime I've ever watched. Just as I kept watching it, I couldn't stop wondering how much it would've took to reach the end. This anime has often been described to me as \"realistic\", \"relatable\" and \"funny\", and as a fool, I believed that it would've actually been a fun trip. It is even labelled as \"Comedy\" on almost every website.\r\nThe show itself is nothing but a lonley and geeky high-school girl ( Her name is Tomoko ) and her struggle to integrate herself into the society and make friends. At first, seemsrelatable towards the ones who have or had the same problems, but it truly isn't. The title itself says \"No matter how I look at it, it's your guys' fault if I'm not popular\", but it is actually Tomoko's own fault for being so bad, and isolated. Now, you'd expect such a character to be not cold nor hot, to have her issues but a positive side, something that we can say about her that would not be as we think... Instead, she's straight up rude, awkward and disrespectful, either with people she doesn't know or her own family.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just filled with sadness, all over it. Not a happy, or even NORMAL moment. For those who praise this anime for being \"realistic\" clearly didn't think this through, as the show is filled with clich\u00e9s and silliness. As an outcast and anti-social person, I can describe Tomoko's experiences past and present as totally unrealistic and odd. Like the fact that in an entire week of school, she had not shared a word with ANYONE exept a barely said \"Goodbye\" to her teacher. Which she took like a win to the lottery, by the way.\\n\r\nThere are also dozens of references to other anime, that are nowhere near subtle, as the only thing that stops from saying their respective name is a censorship *\"beep\"* in the dialogue. Not only some of these reference are out of place, but they are so obvious and in-your-face that I couldn't even enjoy or appreciate them, and I like parodies.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are basically clich\u00e9s and nonexistent, as this anime focuses only on one and one character only.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre, with good, but often overwhelming effects and lazy scenes that can easily be improved. The music can hardly be noticed, and barely adds any impact to any scene. Which is a shame, since the opening is absolutely awesome, and despite the ED isn't one of the best, it is very creative.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done, but when 80% of the dialogue are just inner thoughts coming from the main character, you can barely notice it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, no character, nor story development whatsoever. If I'd just put some percentage to sum it all up, it would be:\\n\r\n60% Depression\\n\r\n30% Random references to other shows\\n\r\n1% Actually relatable scenes\\n\r\n2% Of out of nowhere useless Ecchi you can't even predict \\n\r\nAnd 7% of western and anime clich\u00e9s spread around in random order.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime, unless you really enjoy tragic \"comedies\" or find funny a depressed girl that threatens to kill herself if she doesn't talk to her brother once in a while.\\n\r\nSolid 3/10 and I'm being generous.",

It was Watamote here, Watamote there. Everybody loved this anime. And I'm still wondering why.\r\nThe art is good, the animation is OK, the sound department is decent. The characters were well written and, even that I don't relate to her, Tomoko deserved to be a highlight.\r\nBut the story is what kills Watamote. Nothing happens during the series. I didn't expect a killing like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. I didn't even want she to become popular, what would make the name senseless. ButI expected something to happen. Episode after episode, she tries to change her reality, but fails. She tries and fails. She tries and fails. She tries and fails. 12 episodes of failure after failure. If you watched the first episode, you watched the whole series. \\n\\n\r\nIf Watamote was an OVA, I would accept it better. But a TV series? It's almost unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \"Oh, you didn't understand the concept of the series/the character\" is not a good excuse.",

            "content": "Before watching this anime, answer yourself the following questions:\r\n1.\tDo you consider yourself weird?\r\n2.\tDo you feel like you don\u2019t have any true friends?\r\n3.\tDo you think of sex constantly all day?\r\n4.\tDo you feel like people don\u2019t understand you?\r\nIf you answered yes and no appropriately for a normal human being, skip this anime and watch something else...you're in for torture.\r\nIf you answered no to all of these questions, you're fine. Watch with contentment.\r\nIf you answered yes to all of these questions, though, slap on some naked butler porn and start whacking with toothpaste at the prologue of Episode 1\u2014this anime was made specifically for you.\r\n(Psst. I answered yesto all of them.)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWatashi ga mottenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga warui,\u201d\u2014or from hereforth Watamote\u2014would be equally as titled as \u201cThe Autobiography of the Narcissistic, Melancholic Otaku.\u201d It outlines the boring, waste-of-food lifestyle of an introverted, 21st century teenager, Kuroki Tomoko, and her misadventures in becoming a sociable person. With the lewd objective of capturing the hearts and souls of her peers, with each episode she draws forth a depressing, yet outlandishly hilarious conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in this anime is episodic, outlining the seasons of the school year more definitely as the series progresses. Tomoko struggles with communication, and all but too often winds up doing something socially awkward or unacceptable at little expense of notice to her colleagues. The series gradually draws towards more embarrassing or heartbreaking consequences, all-in-all while Tomoko remains spirited through to the narrow conclusion.  I strongly feel that the story itself is the weakest part and precisely why the series faces much scrutiny; the balance of the plotline heavily relies on a character that is distrusted by the audience, and rapidly grows repetitive with the endless frustration.  I think the series would have benefitted more with another arc, possibly more focused on the character changes that slowly developed as Tomoko\u2019s continued failures amassed.\\n\\n\r\nWhich in regards to the characters, this series shines. Tomoko is undoubtedly a relatable character to a part of all of us\u2014wherein we seek to blame others for our weaknesses, try to change too quickly, and excuse our dark thoughts with solidarity in loneliness. In my lifetime I cannot stress enough how often I\u2019ve thought along similar lines as Tomoko about my peers, only to realize in the end just how catastrophic that was to my personality. The consistent negativity and judgmental thoughts that she exudes are enough to make anyone feel sorry for her, if not additionally hate her.\\n\\n\r\nYet, brilliantly, she emblazons the series as the protagonist (or dare I say \u201canti-hero\u201d.) We watch her struggle to an end to become a happier person, sometimes even feeling proud that she has sought out meaningful changes. Also, considering her level of social anxiety it is fascinating watching her persist and continue to look brightly toward the future. After all we might choose to hate her, but are forced to love her. \\n\\n\r\nLaughing the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki, her brother, is another catch. Though he remains secondary and purely comical, he provides the audience a chance to see Tomoko act as herself. His shrewd responses and sarcasm add just the right amount of flavor. Though many disagree with me, I feel that this was enough to keep the focus on Tomoko alone, preventing her from being trapped in the inner monologue.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Kitta, did an astronomical job voicing for Tomoko. Being a good seiyuu is something expected out of Japan, but her mastery of inner monologue and conflict gave the series a bigger kick than had it been a higher-pitched tsundere. Voicing in a darker, messier timbre than a typical shoujo, Kitta employed the role with the right snappiness and vulgarity expected from a person like Tomoko. Also, her emphasis on certain words and sounds in Japanese (for those of you who don\u2019t speak Japanese just call me a name  and skip this part),  especially puns and sexual innuendos are outstanding. The general grit of her tone alone kept the series best in the balance.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening ranks high on my top 10 favorites. I am a classical musician and absolutely hate scream, yet I am enamoured with this opening.  The 1 minute and 30 seconds of clashing drum sets, vein-popping growls, and echoing female vocals are accompanied by a vignette of Tomoko\u2019s personal struggle. There is a great deal of innuendo of sexual repression and symbolism that is profound to this series. I strongly recommend to everyone to not skip the introduction when watching this series, as it will constantly refresh you about the deepest meaning of the series itself.  The background music is perfect, too. It actually is quite unnoticeable, maybe perhaps for a few weird, sexualized beats, elevator music or accordions. For a series of this nature I think stronger BGMs would make the subject too lighthearted, which defeats the purpose of Tomoko\u2019s character study.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork in Watamote is bewildering.  The splash of light effect and heavy detail on the eyes deceives us to believe that the series is meant to be cute. It, of course, does have many cute moments, but the choice of ambiguously dark colors or animation methods (such as crayon during imaginary scenes) retains the moody quite well.  There is a great amount of detail on the passage of time, as we see emphasis on Tomoko\u2019s moods reflect the time of the day.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you\u2019re afraid of seeing disgusting or repulsive behavior from your protagonist, then go watch cheap, direct-to-video Christmas films. Watamote thrives on less perfect minds and hearts, engaging them as It does Tomoko about her issues and choices.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, make sure your naked butlers are well\u2026nevermind.\\n",

            "content": "An unfortunate truth that many fans of this medium can agree on is this: anime is generally not especially keen on addressing topics like social anxiety or giving them the respect and nuance they deserve. This is not to say this sort of thing doesn\u2019t exist, just that it\u2019s particularly hard to find. WataMote is an outlier, in how it confronts a legitimate issue and portrays it with utmost honesty, while utilizing comedy as a source of amusement and coping, not to make light of the situation. Through a collection of gags conjured in a fundamentally bleak scenario,  WataMote finds amusement and humor ina portrayal of anxiety which rivals that of Evangelion. Perhaps one of the worst, cruelest things to be imposed on someone is the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Shyness can look cute on the outside, but the same can be said about an animal trapped in a zoo. Both sheer hilarity and blistering tragedy ensue in Kuroki Tomoko\u2019s cavalcade of mishaps, exploring the multiple facets of her character which speaks to the hearts of those who have had the displeasure of feeling invisible to society.\\n\\n\r\nVarious monologues, delusions, and fantasies are at play here as we follow Kuroki Tomoko in her quest to become popular. Having almost no social skills whatsoever, much of the action takes place within Tomoko\u2019s own thoughts, from scheming on how to approach a situation to conjuring an ideal fantasy where all her desires are met, sometimes referencing an anime or manga she knows of. Tomoko is genuinely a fun and endearing character to follow, partly thanks to how vividly and creatively her thoughts are presented. Her point of view is depicted in a litany of wacky and comical ways, with each affair being executed in a way that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a battle shounen; exaggerated and dramatic. To say that WataMote plays out like a battle shounen undersells it however. Unlike many manga adaptations which tend to have uninspired camerawork and lazy implementation of dialogue, WataMote is always exercising creativity in how to present her thoughts. New visual elements are constantly brought to the table so that the experience never grows stale. Inventive visual work, snappy pacing, and Tomoko\u2019s constant narrations work in unison to bring this character to life.\\n\\n\r\nDespite depicting these situations in a goofy, comedic light, WataMote presents one of the most accurate depictions of social anxiety I\u2019ve seen in an anime. This portrayal is not limited to simply being nervous or shy in public interactions. Tomoko\u2019s thoughts, perspectives, and attitude all personify that of a socially awkward and anxious high schooler, serving as a basis for her actions. The way her anxiety dictates what she thinks and how she behaves is exploited both comedically and narratively, leading to events which highlight the tragedy of the situation while providing some degree of amusement. All of Tomoko\u2019s delusions and insecurities are welded into a series of gags and humorous moments to exploit the absurdity in her ways of thinking, while eloquently demonstrating what exactly is crippling her in these situations. Feeling nothing but fear and distrust in social situations, Tomoko almost always assumes the worst in people. Internally, she\u2019ll often scoff at or antagonize anyone who isn\u2019t some hot guy she met at a store, and impulsively puts the blame on others for any misfortune that comes up in her day. She\u2019ll desperately gravitate towards any method that is said to make one more popular, attractive, or whichever else, even if it involves purposely getting molested on a train. And yes, she does actually attempt this. The various incidents she pulls herself into are presented in a wacky, hyperbolic manner, sometimes to the point where Tomoko comes off as downright maniacal or demented in certain cases. This particular style does a lot to make Tomoko a very endearing character, but she\u2019s made all the more captivating by how she fully encapsulates what social anxiety is really about. It\u2019s a harrowing dilemma to face especially in your high school years, and it\u2019s one that many of us can admit to have had around the same period as Tomoko has. Almost all of us who have had social anxiety can relate to many of Tomoko\u2019s ordeals, which can possibly bring back painful memories of our own. WataMote subjects us to the bleak and dreary realm of social anxiety and the consequences of having it, amplifying the absurdity of the situations that stem from it to soften the blow. In spite of this glossy exterior, WataMote is made fully aware of the situation and gives it the integrity and nuance it deserves, just as a black comedy should.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary method of which WataMote delivers its humor is by stressing the dichotomy between how Tomoko perceives the world compared to how it actually is. This is the format which pervades the entire show; the reality, often lukewarm and indifferent to Tomoko, is twisted in such a way to abide with her own insecurities. Tomoko constantly deludes herself into believing that she is above everyone else, and it\u2019s portrayed to be rather pitiful, yet still funny and amusing. Consider this scene as an example: on a rainy day, when Tomoko finds that her umbrella is missing, she instinctively assumes it to have been stolen. She then has an internal rage about how she is an innocent victim whose day was ruined by this abominable crime. Then, she stops to realize that her umbrella was just a few feet in another direction. This is a funny moment on its own, but it\u2019s also a perfect example of how Tomoko operates outside the comfort of her own home. When something seemed to be wrong at first, she instinctively assumes it to be another\u2019s wrongdoing, without taking even a second to consider any alternative.\\n\\n\r\nThings that seem relatively mundane and trivial to us are made into a much bigger deal than they need to be. This exact way of thinking is what leads Tomoko into numerous awkward situations involving other people, which is exactly what blocks her off from others. Her rationale is purely based on knee-jerk suspicions rather than logic, some of which are understandable to at least some degree, such as worrying about what classmates will think about the sight of you eating alone. Others can be quite outrageous or downright unfathomable, such as the notion that wearing certain underwear makes you friends more easily. Both of these can be attributed to how someone with social anxiety really operates. Tomoko\u2019s antics come in a seemingly endless variety, as new situations arise after another and more inspiration is attained. Because we are given a thorough introspective on what possesses her to take these actions, it\u2019s made easy to gravitate towards Tomoko and understand what she does, as irrational and ludicrous as they are most of the time. The sad truth of the matter is, as over-the-top and balls-to-the-wall as it\u2019s all portrayed to be, it\u2019s conceptually accurate to how some of us behaved in our adolescent years. Both these factors are what effectively put us in her own shoes, making it all the more uncomfortable to watch when these actions actually follow through, there to be witnessed by outsiders. This discomfort is a large part of what makes it funny, yet oddly impactful on a personal level. I for one can admit to have operated along the same lines as Tomoko in my own school years, and I imagine plenty of others are the same way. Whether you have fully grown out of this phase or are still in the process of doing so, laughing at yourself is a good first step towards moving on with your life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is even the case with her own family as well as her best friend Yuu-chan. Even though they, particularly Yuu-chan, are relatively close to her, they are not exempt from witnessing the crazed antics Tomoko stirs up on a daily basis. Her brother Tomoki serves as a test subject of sorts, as Tomoko uses new bizarre methods of communicating to see how they play out. Tomoki, like everyone else, has no idea what the hell goes on in Tomoko\u2019s mind, and thus wants nothing to do with whatever nonsense she subjects to him. Tomoko\u2019s interactions with her mother go about as smoothly as those with anxious teens who feel as though nobody understands them would expectedly play out with their parents. Yuu-chan, being the only character besides Tomoko\u2019s parents to give her unconditional support and attention, ends up being one of the most likeable characters on offer. Tomoko even still projects herself into Yuu-chan and holds her on the same standards. Yuu-chan\u2019s presence, compared to how she once was, as an attractive, well-endowed specimen with many healthy relationships is an abhorrent sight to Tomoko. What Tomoko feels could be described as a feeling of betrayal, or rather severe envy. Tomoko\u2019s twisted and misguided view on people erects yet another barrier around even her best friend. Luckily for her, most of anything Tomoko would usually do comes with almost no repercussions when around Yuu-chan. Tomoko\u2019s company with Yuu-chan is relatively painless and refreshing compared to that of other people, as Tomoko is rarely wound into such humiliating incidents. In a way, seeing these characters together is somewhat euphoric. Nonetheless, there is still much awkwardness to be be found among their interactions, as Tomoko\u2019s insane ideas run amok even still. Tomoko\u2019s interactions with these characters are very distinct from one other, which makes Tomoko feel more like an actual person and makes each encounter with them very unique. As a result, WataMote is given plenty more sources of comedy at its disposal and makes Tomoko\u2019s moments involving them varied and original.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all these shenanigans at play, WataMote doesn\u2019t shy away from providing full, unfiltered attention to Tomoko\u2019s dilemma when it needs to. Whenever Tomoko is legitimately hurt or grief-stricken by what happens, the show seizes to pull any punches at that point. The limelight is positioned squarely on her humiliation and anguish, often laying a somber melody upon the scene; she even sheds tears at some points. These moments might as well be climaxes, as she is in a position where no ounce of delusion can divert her from the crude reality of what she\u2019s led herself into. WataMote understands this disorder which Tomoko is bound by, and knows full well when it is no longer a laughing matter. The absence of comedy during these moments is enough to draw attention to how affected Tomoko really is; yet another factor of what makes her so easy to feel for. Of course, once these moments pass, the proper course of action is not to dwell on those past situations, but to shrug it off, move on, and hope tomorrow will be better. And this is exactly what WataMote does. The moment follows through, the whole arc fades into a somber close, and the cycle begins anew. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show\u2019s structure is based around repetition, WataMote is not exempt from providing actual character development. The actions Tomoko takes do in fact affect what she does in future events. Additionally, as the show draws into its later half, Tomoko\u2019s denial lessens while she gradually becomes more accepting of her dilemma. Her life concurrently becomes more bleak and hopeless as a result. This is the point where her actions, while still less than ideal, become significantly more reasonable, as she makes a conscious effort towards amending her newly found flaws. This development comes across very naturally; there\u2019s nothing drastic or sudden about this change. It comes in minimal pieces as Tomoko retains what she has experienced through her mishaps. Of course, she never truly unbounds herself from the self-destructive tendencies we see throughout. As we all know, it\u2019s incredibly easy to fall back to old habits.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see that if Tomoko was a person in real life, she would not be a fun person to interact with or be around, but that doesn\u2019t make her struggles any less real. Despite how abrasive and hostile she is portrayed to be overall, Tomoko is a character who is easy to sympathize with, because the full context of her troubles is made very clear. While not exactly universal, experiencing this kind of distress is something very many people can identify with. Because of this, we immediately understand her actions, even if we don\u2019t find them to rational in any sense. Her life is very empty and miserable, affirmed all the more through her constant denial and acts of desperation. We want her to succeed, and thus seeing her get into humiliating situations through her own doing is genuinely an unpleasant experience. It just goes to show how coming out of your shell is never an easy task for anyone. Whatever Tomoko suffers through, we are forced to suffer through with her.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads into what is perhaps the most common criticism towards WataMote. For many people, WataMote is a very uncomfortable, cringe-inducing experience. I would be one of the first to agree that the show is certainly uncomfortable at many points, but I would also say that it is so for the right reasons. Some say it\u2019s uncomfortable for the reason that Tomoko is unlikeable, which is obviously something I disagree on quite strongly. Others say it\u2019s for the reason that they don\u2019t want to see Tomoko go through these miserable affairs. As mentioned previously, despite how frequently and badly she fucks up, there is change in her character to be found along the way. While not always necessarily positive, it\u2019s still change nonetheless. These small changes show that there is legitimate hope for her. For this reason, it\u2019s made all the more cathartic and heartwarming when Tomoko really does manage to find a fair bit of comfort towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does she reflect nearly every facet of the usual social awkwardness that resides in many high schoolers, she\u2019s also a funny and charming character independent of that. Her antics are unpredictable and she\u2019s endearingly quirky through each passing episode. She is voiced extremely well in the Japanese audio as well as the English dub. Of course, a considerable factor in what makes Tomoko so appealing to many is her visual design itself. Her small stature and baggy, half-open eyes make her look rather cute with an element of mischief, which is perfect for the character. The way she constantly and drastically changes into different expressions is a huge factor in what makes this character so funny and loveable through each of her schemes and shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how commendable the design of Tomoko really is, it\u2019s a shame that her design is the only memorable one in the entire show. Almost every other character is rendered to a bland default anime design with very little distinguishing qualities. This is excusable for background characters, but the more important characters don\u2019t fare much better. Yuu-chan\u2019s design has only her yellow hair and well-endowed physique to make her stand out from the rest. Even Tomoko\u2019s own family suffers from a lack of inspiration in their design. It\u2019s unfortunate that this is how it turned out to be, but it could also just further affirm how remarkable the design of Tomoko really is.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the visual department on the whole is something to be admired. The backgrounds are bold and daring, which makes the scenery very eye-catching and vibrant. The animation is very fluid, especially when it really needs to be. Never did I feel as though the animation quality was ever lacking through any of my viewing experiences. Perhaps the most unique and notable aspect of the visuals is how the lens flares are designed. Light sources like the sun always produce flares that take the form of angular shapes. There isn\u2019t a particular rhyme or reason for this design choice, but rather it serves to further enforce the cartoony nature, which is perfectly welcome in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you think of \u201cself-insertion\u201d in anime, there\u2019s a good chance that conjures up images of an ideal fantasy world in which the protagonist is blessed with numerous desires and conflict is trivialized; basically your typical harem or isekai. WataMote is self-insert in a different way, where you connect Tomoko\u2019s various mishaps to that of your own. Once this happens, WataMote provides an experience few other anime could hope to emulate. It\u2019s hellbent on reaching that one specific audience it\u2019s directed towards, and does so marvelously. The \u201cthorned rose\u201d analogy is perhaps more applicable here than it is with any other show in recent memory. It is shame however that WataMote covers only a portion of its source material, meaning that an ideal conclusion for Tomoko isn\u2019t present here. This leaves the only hope of getting one to the manga itself, or perhaps a possible anime sequel. Regardless of this shortcoming, I for one am glad to have laughed, cried, cringed, and cheered through Tomoko\u2019s endeavors.",

            "content": "We\u2019ve all gone through a certain point in our lives where we just want to feel less lonely even though our abilities for social interactions are limited for some inexplicable reason. Shows that remind us of those dark times can be polarizing for the majority to comprehend and because of this we don\u2019t see many shows try to tackle the subject. The reason being the fact that most people don\u2019t like to revisit what made them so miserable for so long. Luckily for some of us, we always look back at those moments and laugh at how silly it was and thanks to the showWatamote we can now have a show that does that for us.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the gag manga, Watamote is set as your typical slice of life show, only this time they added some new twists into the mix that make it a little more fresh than others; dark demented twists so to speak. It is dark in its subject matter but at the same time it has a comedic overtone that compliment each other very well. You have Tomoko\u2019s wild intentions on wanting to be popular yet is unable to due to her supreme lack of social skill and the fact that she has been somewhat of a hikikomori for the majority of her life. The camera angles that constantly pans to her face that often looks distorted from the style of animation it tries to exacerbate really give you a sense of dread and anguish for her yet at the same time you can\u2019t help but laugh at her expense. The show also goes into parody territory by showcasing your typical awkward moment of conversation such as picking up a dropped pencil from a classmate sitting next to you and so forth. This is done with some clever flashback sequences that show us Kuroko\u2019s comprehensive mindset.\\n\\n\r\nSporadic and chaotic are the two words that sum up the humor of Watamote. This is a blessing and a curse to the show as a whole, in which the humor in this show is very unpredictable and goes to new levels of hilarity as time goes on but at the same time it can get quite repetitive quickly. Repetitive in the sense that Kuroko\u2019s constant ramblings and random noises she makes when she goes insane are done too frequently and mostly comes across as tedious than charming after a while. What does save the humor is the actual build-up of the most funniest bits that feel very fresh and unexpected to see thanks to the well-thought out dialogue that is written in those scenes; scenes that involve Tomoko and her mother in her room as her audio recording of a male seiyuu is played in the background and joining a couple of boys peek into a love motel.\\n\\n\r\nOne other small aspect that I truly admire about the comedy is the chemistry between Tomoko and her brother Kuroki and their hilarious dialogue exchanges to one another. Whenever the both of them are on-screen together, you get the actual feeling that this is how most siblings treat each other on a daily basis; they don\u2019t necessarily like each other when they are in their personal space but they\u2019re nonetheless bound by blood and can\u2019t help but feel for each others troubles. It\u2019s a shame they don\u2019t have enough screen-time together, that way we could see some growth between them but what we have here at this point is enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nTo start out with characters, Tomoko is the type of person you either grew up knowing someone like her or you grew up as her, but for the most part we\u2019ve all been the latter. We\u2019ve all just wanted to try to put up an act of ourselves to make us seem edgy or cool but end up failing miserably as a result. Tomoko herself is the main driving point in the show who performs her antics with pure charm and sympathy, thanks in part to her voice actress Izumi Kitta who is extraordinary playing as her. Her ability to create Kuroko\u2019s personality is almost inhuman in a good way, though there are some times where she performs her job too well to the point where it sounds like she\u2019s going to pass out near the end of the take.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the other characters share the same kind of memorability or charisma as Kuroko does, with the exception of her brother of course. Her best friend Yuu Naruse, played by Kana Hanazawa, is a pretty bland childhood friend type of character who isn\u2019t given much to her performance other than to show more of Kuroko\u2019s despair. Now one way to defend this is by looking at it as the fact that Kuroko is the only character that is the center focus of the entire show. The rest of the characters don\u2019t even have to be fully developed because all we are focusing is on the main character Kuroko alone. It gives off the same loneliness feeling that she is going through to let the audience feel the same thing to make us feel contempt for her sorrow. Then again that\u2019s what makes the comedy all the more meaningful and hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say the comedy is always perfect by any means. There are times where we\u2019re taken into situations that go a little too far and the comedic timing doesn\u2019t even provide any humorous feedback because of how poorly handled they are. Not that they were anything life-altering disturbing but it\u2019s one of those moments where you raise your one eyebrow and feel uncomfortable at the same time. While there are some hiccups here and there, the writing does jump back into the swing of things and provide endless over-the-top humor that is both dark and clever. The numerous parodies to other anime are a definite plus as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat better way to start out your typical slice of life show when you could just provide a loud bombastic metal song into it to make it edgy?  No doubt the opening might alienate people since obviously it feels out-of-place by the fact that the scenes being shown in the opening have absolutely nothing to do with the show. I would argue that it\u2019s heavily symbolic as if we\u2019re in Kuroko\u2019s own subconscious thought in how her thought-process is majority of the time and for that it\u2019s a pretty decent opening. The rest of the music is here is fun and nice to listen to, even though it will eventually be forgotten in about two years time.\\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that the show is very demented to watch and might leave people with a really sick feeling in their stomach, but it\u2019s something that anyone shouldn\u2019t pass off if they are a big fan of dark comedy and a parodied look into the otaku lifestyle. It can be a tedious ride if you can\u2019t handle the repetitive nature of Kuroko\u2019s random ramblings but there\u2019s always that one moment that makes the ride worth it to go through. A moment that makes you have tears roll down your eyes from sheer laughter and going absolutely nuts by how bold the humor can be observed as uncomfortable. After all, we need more admirable shows like Watamote that isn\u2019t afraid to go too far with its jokes.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B\\n",

Many people including myself have been able to connect themselves to the main character Tomoko in the sense of the frustrations that they have with feeling unknown to the rest of the world.\r\nWatching this series, with the relationship between Tomoko and her younger brother Tomoki it had me thinking about how I see my relationship with my own sibling and I, how even though they didn't get along they still share memories together and take the extra step to tolerate each other.\r\nAbove that, the interactions between the background characters that Tomoko had observed showsperspective on how unaware some people may be of the others around them, if they are lonely and need company or even need somebody to talk to.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the ending of episode 11 where the class representative in charge of the culture festival, Imae, noticed Tomko was lonely after her friend Yuu had left, then got in the mascot costume and offered her a balloon. When Tomoko went to take the balloon she pulled her in for a hug. That was one of the sweetest moments I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also introduces very interesting music and makes several humorous references to other popular animes. If anyone is looking to watch something a little different this is definitely the series to watch.",

            "content": "If you live under a rock, you\u2019re probably impressed by Family Guy\u2018s and South Park\u2018s \u2018dark\u2019 humor. They show you people suffering, dying and cursing. They expect you to laugh because people are dying, suffering and cursing. You\u2019re supposed to be shocked that the creators don\u2019t mind putting these characters though such a pain, but that\u2019s not a major achievement. Terrorists do it all the time, but it doesn\u2019t make them comedians.\r\nA truly dark comedy is not that one avoids that darkness. It\u2019s one that forces us to confront the darkness of it and still laugh. Even Borderlands, where the whole joke is that everyonethinks dying is a joke has insight into violence and how we perceive it. It\u2019s an exaggeration of the flippant treatment most video games have for violence. Likewise, WataMote is an anime that stares into the eyes of the abyss that is being socially retarded\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is a dark comedy. It\u2019s far darker than any so-called \u2018for adult\u2019 cartoons from the West. It doesn\u2019t create a bunch of punchlines and try to make the premise fit the jokes. It\u2019s aware of the how crippling Tomoko\u2019s situation is, and it tries to find humor among all the darkness. It uses humor not to downplay the darkness, but as a means of coping.\\n\\n\r\nShyness is cute when you look at it from the outside, but so is a panda bear caged in a zoo. Tomoko has the privileges of the Western world, such as running water and food. How much of a consolation is it when you have no way to relate to the world?\\n\\n\r\nHuman beings are social creatures. Isolation is one of the worst type of punishment you can bring on one. That\u2019s where solitary confinement comes from. Without feedback from others to keep us in reality, it can feel like it\u2019s slipping away from us. A similar process can happen with sensory deprivation.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what happens to Tomoko. There is a gross contrast between how she views herself and the world, and how it really is. The world outside is not very hostile. In high school, the popular kids are too busy having fun to bully you. People will talk to you if you initiate. At worst, they\u2019ll be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nIndifference isn\u2019t harmful in and of itself. It doesn\u2019t target you. When that\u2019s the only feedback you get, it becomes scary. Tomoko barely spends any time in the real world. We spend most of the episodes inside her head. In her inner monologues, she talks fast, with a steady pace and a hard voice. She\u2019s full of energy and life.\\n\\n\r\nThen she opens her mouth and barely a word comes out. The people often react in confusion. You can\u2019t expect them to react in any other way to a person who can barely utter a phrase. Since it\u2019s not complete approval, Tomoko\u2019s dualistic worldview sees it as negative and she runs away.\\n\\n\r\nThat dualistic worldview is another aspect of being a social retard. Tomoko sees things in black and white. There are popular kids, and losers like her. In her eyes, Yuu turned from a loser geek to a \u2018popular slut\u2019, although all we see is that Yuu developed breasts and dyed her hair. Tomoko tries a little to fit in, and when it doesn\u2019t work she throws the bathwater with the baby.\\n\\n\r\nThe absurdity of social anxiety is that it makes you fail in basic, day-to-day interactions. Tomoko\u2019s failures wouldn\u2019t bother and otherwise well-adjusted person. People say embarassing shit all the time. Most of them say so many things that one failure doesn\u2019t bother them. Tomoko always bets all her money on one single moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy comes from the darkness itself, from how absurd it is. We\u2019re talking about a barrier that doesn\u2019t exist physically. Nothing prevents Tomoko from talking with people but herself. She\u2019s fighting a shadow. Seeing a person fight something invisible is both sad and funny at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the comedy is just from Tomoko\u2019s failures. Thankfully, the creators are imaginative enough. They make these realistic failures, rather than inserting a poop joke or a sex joke like a lot of Western comedy does. There is also a powerful use of silence. It\u2019s another way of pointing out the joke, but it lets the situation stand on its own. Besides, it\u2019s a more realistic reaction to absurdity. Something absurd is something we don\u2019t know how to react to. We may need time to think it over.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko would\u2019ve nothing without her voice actress. It\u2019s a brilliant performance. She has to play different characters. Tomoko is a megalomaniac world-dominator in her monologues but a coward when she speaks. Her voice actress doesn\u2019t just capture this World Dominator in her speech, but she performs it with chinks in the armor. She exaggerates the confidence so much that it\u2019s clear Tomoko tries hard to convince herself. As for how she does Tomoko\u2019s stuttering, I doubt any person can replicate it so well. The fact a dub was even attempted is a brave, but probably an Icarian feat.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design fares a little worse. Tomoko isn\u2019t really ugly. She looks odd and a distortion of the Moe design. Her eyes are huge, but have a darkness in them that looks frightening. Her figure or facial features aren\u2019t special enough to cause any shock. She looks likes she\u2019d rather listen to My Chemical Romance and Avenged Sevenfold rather than look for a boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThe state of comedy is a poor one. Too many comedies are references to sex and shit in-between random words. It\u2019s hard to find a comedy that understands comedy\u2019s purpose \u2013 finding humor in the absurdity of life. If it can find humor in the darker parts, then all the better. Whatever you think of anime in general, WataMote is a great work of comedy.\\n\\n\r\n4 anxiety fits out of 5",

Ok so the anime \"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou KangaetemoOmaera ga Warui!\" has ended and I must say that it was a rather unique one since it is all about a typical Japanese loner\\ loser who doesn't seem to do anything by herself to improve her social skills. Frankly if I can compare this anime to a western cartoon the close that it would be is 'Ed, Edd and Eddie\" co'z both features a typical teenagers whom were pretty much losers in life that I would like to whack their heads with a rolled up newspaper, except in \"Ed, Edd, and Eddie\" I 'd give those characters some respect since they're the kind of losers who never stopped trying, while in \"Watamote\" the girl loser never tries at all. Ok so I think I'm gonna have to present my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did mentioned about this anime's uniqueness, since its slice of life was focus on Kuroki Tomoko a loner and pessimist who procrastinates a lot, her story simply represents the very thing that every loner does and what he/she wishes which either she becomes a hokikomori if he/she is unconsciously  contented of being a loner or eventually get a life and enjoy the world provided that such determination to change oneself is present. But in this case the story of the everyday life of a loser girl like Tomoko was more amusing that one would like to be the backseat character and criticize Tomoko for not having the guts nor the fortitude to even improve herself, also the story shows us that improvement is something that one must undertook by herself, that is, if there is really a determination for one to really improve.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell for Tomoko, at one point I'm a little bit disgusted about her illustration, attire and facial concept, but, I can't deny that it was those very concept that makes her funny. Also, there is a few fanservice that me likey, like Imae's one time panty shot and Yuu's big bouncing melons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for Tomoko which includes, the way she catches her breath, her evil smirk, evil tone and of course I also like the way that her brother's speaking tone when he get's piss off by her antics. Oh, and about the opening theme, it really doesn't fit the anime as a whole, unless thai anime has an intense action genre, in fact the closing theme fits better as an opening theme. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nI may be a bit pissed about the main character Tomoko, ok so she might have some aggression within her and her fantasies are too dark to comprehend, then again she's not bad to be this stupid loser high schooler, which the only types pf people she can get along with are kids and middle school perves. So the \"Decent\" score is for her.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Naruse, maybe Tomoko only friend or least when they were in middle school, but the thing about her is that she doesn't make any effort to change Tomoko and it's rather annoying, then again she does provide this hot bodacious babe that's present in every anime\\manga.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki on the other hand he is somewhat this character that I would like to give her sister a rude awakening, however just like Yuu he's also annoying that he doesn't do anything to change her sister, Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mom, what I like about her is the part that she has to give Tomoko a bitch slap because of Tomoko's stupid antics with the vacuum cleaner.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is one anime where we the audience would like to be a backseat character who would wanna give the main character a rude awakening if she ever wants to have an enjoyable high school life. Also I did mentioned about the uniqueness about this anime that deals with a typical Japanese loser which can only go two ways; become a hokikomori if he/she is  unconsciously contented of being alone and blames the world for his fate or get a life if such determination to change exist in that particular person. Overall, this is one of the best anime for this season despite of its shabby final episode. The end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n l\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you think the main character of this anime is pathetic, two things can easily be concluded from that:\r\n1) You have a great life. Congratulations!\r\n2) You're an insensitive prick. Congratulations...?\r\nNow on to the review.\r\nSTORY : On the surface, this anime appears to be comedic tale of a loner who's desperate for attention and friends. Her situation is so bad that she can't even utter a word in public. That's it, right? No plot development, no clich\u00e9 transformation to a beautiful/popular girl, and no happy ending.\r\nNo, that's definitely not it.\r\nThis anime is about a girl with social anxiety. Being someone who suffers from social anxiety, althoughnot on as serious level as her, I can say that there's nothing funny or \"pathetic\" about suffering from social anxiety. Before you go and say: \"Come on! What's so bad about it? Just talk to people! Make friends!\", let me just make it clear that its impossible for shy people to easily communicate or indulge with friends easily because we're very conscious of ourselves and our surroundings. What about delusions and fantasies? That's also part of being a social failure, I can vouch for that.\\n\\n\r\nART : Brilliant. The character design, the background, everything about the art is brilliant. Couldn't find a single flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : Personally, I loved the opening and ending theme. The opening theme portrays the mind of someone suffering from anxiety perfectly. The anguish and envy in the song and Tomoko's expressions...ah, so accurate! Voice-acting was good, although you might need some time to get used to Tomoko's voice.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : The main character is fantastic. She's realistic and not all cutesy like most anime and that's just what makes her so awesome. Her relationship with her brother is also realistic and cute (at some points). Yuu-chan...erm, what can I say about her? She's a slut.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : I enjoyed it. I laughed at her misfortunes that often reminded me of my blunders in the past, and empathized with her dearly throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : This anime is not for everyone, that is given. Watch it if you're going through the same thing and half laugh, half cry while watching it (like I did). Its definitely not for people who have lots of friends and/or look down on loners. Will this make you feel fuzzy and warm inside? No, it's uncomfortable especially if you can relate to her. But its realistic. I can't emphasize on this factor enough; not everyone has a perfect high school life, you know. A realistic anime once in a while won't hurt'cha, buddy.",

            "content": "I. Freaking. AM. This girl.\r\nI have struggled with social anxiety most of my life.  I've never felt like I belonged to part of a group, and I've always felt like more of a shadow than a real person in the eyes of others. I'm taking medication for it now, but that doesn't stop the pain of those memories.\r\nSo for me, Watamote was like reading a very embarrassing autobiography. I related to the main character, and it made me ashamed.\r\nFirst off, this anime is hardcore cringe comedy. You WILL have to pause the show at least once just because watching this girl fail is sopainful. You will scream no at your television, only for your plea to fall on deaf ears and Tomoko to humiliate herself anyways. It's not a feel good, chortle jubilantly whilst crunching on pocky sort of anime. It's a face-palm-and-shake-your-head-despairingly anime. If that doesn't sound like a roaring good time to you, then you should probably go watch Lucky Star instead.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lucky Star, that's just one of the many anime Watamote references. Ghost in the Shell, Haruhi Suzumiya, Death Note, and a plethora of other shows are visually mimicked from time to time for your viewing enjoyment. Okay, that's a nice shout out to otaku, I guess. And I suppose it helps emphasize Tomoko's otaku nature. But I can't help but feel like this show is more preoccupied with imitating iconic images rather than creating its own. That's the danger when you rely to heavily on shout-outs and references: you leave no room to make your own impression.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is Watamote's visual failing. The animation is never bad, but it never goes beyond bare simplicity. You are ANIME, art incarnate, moving masterpiece, you shouldn't settle for mere passing. Watamote fails to create any sort of distinctive style of its own. It's bland. If you do not create images that stick in the mind of your audience, then you are going to be forgotten. Ironically, that's a lesson Tomoko is very aware of, and yet her own show fails to put it to use. So I must award you no points for style.\\n\\n\r\nBack to my own neuro-chemical failings: as someone with social anxiety, I understand what it is like to struggle to connect with people in a way that is meaningful. Watamote definitely got that message across. Unfortunately, it provides no light at the end of the tunnel, and thus ends up feeling somewhat hollow. Now, mental illness is a hard subject to portray, because it does not lend itself to a satisfying story-arc. You do not OVERCOME things like anxiety and depression. There is no final battle, no clear climax. Instead, it is a slow, uphill struggle. There is no end, because it's not something that ever goes away. That makes a satisfying conclusion almost impossible. A person can't just suddenly \"get better\" from internal struggles. If they do, it comes across as contrived and insincere (see the TV ending of Evangelion). Victory against mental struggles is so gradual that it can be hard to see, which is why it can be very unsatisfying for an audience to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWatamote falls into the trap of trying to show character development in a way that is thematically satisfying, but distant from real life. The conclusion of the show has some last-minute growth from our main character, probably in order to give its audience a freaking bone after all that torture. However, as someone who has struggled with this same issue (and as such as the likely target audience of the show), I know that sort of change doesn't happen. I don't want to see the main character be able to put aside all their anxiety with the click of a button, because I know that kind of change isn't lasting. Poor Tomoko will be back to her regular behavior in a week, with no permanent improvement.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying to make things look magically better, why not just give her small victories throughout? That's how real progress is made. It comes not from willing your situation away, but slowly learning to deal with it. Show her continuing to reach out to people in her own minute, faltering ways. Then, even if she fails, help build that gradual change in her perception that she is learning to deal with rejection and failure, so it isn't as crushing. At the very least, have her experience empathy towards others, and learn to focus less on her internal, selfish problems, and more on being able to sympathize with others.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just ranting now. All in all, it is refreshing to see this sort of main character. I mean, how often do you see a female nerd as the main protagonist? Practically never. And despite my gripes, the show was fun to watch, even if it occasionally made my stomach turn. However, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone who isn't hard core otaku. If you aren't some sort of social misfit, it might be hard to find common ground with Tomoko, and would make her very hard to relate to. Which funny enough, is pretty much her struggle within the show. Watamote is a strange little piece, and most people will probably just want to ignore it. But whether you acknowledge it or not, it's still there, waiting for someone to notice.",

            "content": "Ohh, Watamote. Where do I begin? I'll just start by answering my own question and basically explain to you the things you will say while watching this:\r\n    \" Man, I'm so grateful for my life.\"\r\n    \"Sadly, I can relate.\"\r\n    \"I have so much second hand embarrassment for her...\"\r\n    \" NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO,DON\"T DO IT, GAHHH, I CAN'T WATCH HER MESS HER LIFE UP!!\"\r\n    \"Tomoko, that's not how life works...*facepalm*.\"\r\nSo that's pretty much all your feels in anutshell....\\n\\n\r\n--Story-- 8/10\\n\r\nCreated by Nico Tanigawa and watched by several idiots, Watamote is about an anti-social 15 year old girl who's always wanted to be popular. In addition, she is somewhat an otaku and very pessimistic yet she thinks very highly of herself. Throughout the series, you get to watch Tomoko's struggle to becoming popular. The anime is episodic so you see something new and weird in every episode, even some ecchi scenes are included in Watamote (how's that for advertising). In most situations, she's the girl anime version of Bad Luck Brian, which, in that aspect, really makes the show hilarious. Watamote is an anime where, whether you like it or not really just depends on your type of humor. However, this brings me back to the \"watched by several idiots\" part. If you're a person who is \"innocent\" per say, Watamote  isn't for you. I've seen many people saying \" This is so inappropriate, it advertises how girls should feel in a wrong way!\" I have to disagree with that, now, I understand that some scenes maybe offensive however, it's supposed to be for comedy and it's anime, what do you expect?  Not only that, but you learn a lesson from all of the protagonist's faults and if you don't catch the moral of the episode then boiiii, you best be gettin dat education. \\n\\n\r\n--Art-- 7/10  \\n\r\nThe art style was average. Most of the characters looked like any other typical anime characters and had the same body shape and appearance. The backgrounds weren't anything great, though, they were realistic, but, again, typical. On the upside, the productions did very well depicting the animation to match the look and feels of characters and situations. They also made some scenes quite distinctive from any other comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound-- 9/10\\n\r\nThe OST is splendid. Both the opening and ending are very unique for an anime like Watamote. The background music does a great job at setting the mood for a situation as well. Sometimes, the sound is very happy go lucky at first then it would languish, depending on the situation. The seiyuu's also did a fantastic job at voice acting, Tomoko's voice couldn't have been any better. Overall, the sound is one of the most memorable parts of Watamote and definitely humorous.\\n\\n\r\n--Character-- 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Watamote were quite flat. Tomoko is the only actual character the other characters that show up consistently are her brother, Tomoki and her friend, Yuu-chan. The rest of the cast are insignificant and only show up in one episode. With Tomoko's iilogical thinking and werid predicaments. It's nice to have someone like her brother to keep the viewers sane.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment-- 9/10\\n\r\n Despite the flaws, Watamote was definitely enjoyable. I anticipated every episode and every episode kept me intrigued. Whether its's the humor, music, Tomoko, the illogically thinking or even the offensive scenes, this anime is memorable. Watamote is an anime that I will re-watch when I'm feelin down in the dumps, just to get a good laugh.   \\n\\n\r\n--Overall-- 8/10 \\n\r\nThe anime overall was average, however, due to the unique and comedic elements, I rate Watamote with a 8/10. I recommend this to people who are looking for something relatable or amusing. Until next time, goodbye my fellow organisms.\\n\\n\r\n P.S. This is my second review so feedback is much appreciated ^_^",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nThere is a scene in Watamote where the main character, Tomoko, experiences what she believes to be public molestation. She panics, unable to even breathe or call for help. The train suddenly stops, and the passengers begin to take their leave. Tomoko then realizes that the object pressing against her is simply a bamboo sword belonging to the girl behind her. After much public embarrassment, she finally breaks free, and moves on to yet another miserable day of her life. \r\nTo say that Watamote is an uncomfortable anime would be an understatement. Every minute involves Tomoko failing at something in the most awkward wayimaginable, to the point where you can't help but pity the poor girl. It's not even amusing. It's just depressing.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is a high school girl that simply wants to be liked by her peers. She wants to be seen as attractive by the opposite sex. She is so lonely and socially inept that even hearing a \"goodbye\" from a classmate is seen as a massive success. Her younger brother doesn't care about her problems, her parents think she's a pathetic pervert, and her only friend (who she rarely even sees) is oblivious to Tomoko's blatant emotional issues. She is alone with nobody to help. \\n\\n\r\nDoes she bring some of these problems upon herself? Maybe. Does she try too hard to be somebody that she's not? Definitely. But who can blame her? The only time she had anything even remotely resembling a normal life was when she was a toddler. Of course she's angry. Of course she's fed-up with her lifestyle. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the source material which presents itself entirely as a gag manga, the anime teases us with signs that Tomoko might actually be changing for the better. But nothing ever does change. She squanders all her opportunities, leaving both her and the audience with a bitter sense of hopelessness. What's the point in enduring so many embarrassing scenes when there is no payoff at the end? Are we meant to be masochists? \\n\\n\r\nThe humor of Watamote is akin to kicking a kitten, and worse - a kitten that you sympathize with. It's a punchline where there is no punchline. The goal is make us laugh at somebody in a pitiable situation, to feel happy that our lives are not quite as bad as Tomoko's. Is that comedy? Is that entertainment? For others, perhaps, but all it did for me was bring back awful memories and remind me of everything wrong with teenagers. Some scenes were so uncomfortable that I had to take a break or avert my eyes for a few moments. That's not what a comedy is supposed to do. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the jokes can be quite funny, though. If you've ever listened to porn or something equally embarrassing on your computer, only to realize that the headphones weren't actually plugged in, well, Watamote will remind you of such times. The best moments are when the humor is restrained and situational. The dialogue between Tomoko and her brother is also well-written and reminiscent of most actual brother-sister relationships; I just wish that there was more of him. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also very easy to relate to Tomoko's situation if you've ever dealt with social anxiety. Sure, her feelings are blatantly exaggerated for comedic effect, but the way people act around her is very much real. Teenagers love to gossip. They love to ignore and exclude anybody that isn't a part of their group. Watamote hits this fact home, reminding us just how idealized high school life is in anime. It is the opposite of escapism. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation quality, Watamote is an above-average anime. Each scene is made even more depressing by the dark, often blue-and-grey color scheme. The animation is consistent (though there isn't much of it) and, for once, a shut-in character does not look like a supermodel. Tomoko looks disheveled, tired, and unclean. As she should. The animators don't even hold back on making some scenes look utterly repulsive (including a failed experiment with make-up, and a colony of ants making their home in Tomoko's hair... ugh). There's definitely some talent here, and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is more of a mixed bag. Kitta Izumi does a fantastic job of voicing Tomoko's character, but the background music is barely noticeable and the opening is some mixture of awful screamo and generic J-Pop. It's a cacophony that I never wanted to sit through more than once (although I'm sure that I'm in the minority). At least the ending sequence sounds more in line with the tone of the series: delightfully disgusting, and cute all the same. \\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, Watamote should be commended for daring to be different. This is not your ordinary anime. If it was an ordinary anime, Tomoko would be male and she would have a harem in love with her for some inexplicable reason. There is none of that. Watamote wastes no time on romanticizing the high school life, and instead portrays it for what is in reality. Few anime out there have had the courage to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all the awful, depressing things we see happen to Tomoko, what do we get for it at the end? Nothing but a sad glimpse of a girl desperately clinging to the hope that some day, she might attain a normal person's happiness. A dream that we all know will never be fulfilled.",

            "content": "WataMote is a painful story.  That's the easiest way to describe it.  It's the painful story of a painfully anti-social girl's painful life.  There are very large pros to having a story like this, but there are also huge cons that can come with it.  WataMote is no exception, it's amazing but also majorly flawed.  So why did I give it a 9?  Because the flaws with stories like this is that they are completely hit or miss, there's no in between.  For me it was a home run, but it's very understandable that it can be astrike out.\\n\\n\r\nBaseball metaphors aside, let's get into why WataMote is good and why it's bad.\\n\\n\r\nIt's relatable.  The strongest thing that painful stories have is that people who have felt similar pain can relate to the main character, when that occurs a person can easily fall in love with a story.  If you're someone that is anti-social, socially awkward, shy, or can't express yourself well then you'll find Tomoko practically reading your mind at several points.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about people who aren't like that?  What of you folks who can easily talk with people, have tons of friends and go out and have fun regularly?  What you end up with is a gruelingly torturing story of a sad girl futilely attempting to make friends.  When you see the things in the story that happen to Tomoko, you don't go \"It's so true!\" You go \"Oh, my god that's so sad.  Poor Tomoko.\"\\n\\n\r\nLet's put it this way.  While you watch you might think, \"When is someone just gonna go up and try to become friends with her?\"  In a fluffy story about friendship that would happen.  But this is a realistic story about a loner, that person who wants to become her friend doesn't exist, in the story or real life.  If you're thinking \"That's terrible.\"  Then you probably won't like WataMote.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the story objectively also opens some flaws to you.  There is almost no plot.  The entire story is just the life of Tomoko, period.  The pace is slow and and the progression is very lifelike, AKA nonexistent.  There is a notable amount of repetition and things can eventually become stale.  To a person who's experienced similar pain however, these issues are nearly invisible because of how close to life it is.  But that doesn't excuse that the issues exist.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting thing about WataMote is that the only true character is Tomoko.  There are only two other notable characters and even they are very minor to things.  When this show says it's about a girl with no friends it means it.  The whole story revolves around Tomoko observing the world around her and making commentaries, trying to become popular, and then reverting back to her NEET state in recovery from the pain.  Being that everything is about her and her alone, the story is very Me VS The World, which some can enjoy but a lot of people can easily find so much time spent with just one character suffocating.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter how you look at it however, Tomoko is a brilliant character.  She is realistic at scary levels.  She has no friends, but wants to make some.  So then why does she spend all day cooped up in her room?  Why does she watch what her classmates do in disgust?  It's because that's how she has developed to survive.  The only way to make it okay to not have friends subconsciously is to hate them, yet she consciously still wants friends.  She wants to go out and have fun, but subconsciously she knows that only pain awaits outside her room.  Tomoko is absurdly lifelike and likable.\\n\\n\r\nA big part of her character is that no matter what happens.  No matter how likable she is, she is never cute or moe in any way which is so important for this show to make her relatable.  Several times I got see absorbed into Tomoko's character that I started to fantasize about nice things happening to her, which is exactly what she does to get her spirits up.  Your spirits get lowered to the same level as hers as she connects to you.  I didn't want to refer to her as Tomoko as I watched, I wanted to call her Watashi(Me).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of WataMote is excellent.  Kitta Izumi does a brilliant job as Tomoko.  Her voice is unique, fitting, and enjoyable.  The opening  is fantastic in my opinion.  It takes a very different direction than typical openings by being a serious dramatization of Tomoko's desire to break out of her recluse nature.  The ending in contrast shows the representation of Tomoko's inner awareness that she can't break out of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also notable.  It's simple but also very expressive and erratic at many points.  Tomoko is a NEET and she looks the part.\\n\\n\r\nSo with what I've said it might seem like WataMote is the a massively depressing story, that's not entirely wrong.  The way that it manages to keep things lighthearted is by always trying to make the depressing let downs, failures, and truly pitiful successes comedic.  It's a dark humor, it's funny how much Tomoko is beat down, not because I like watching girls in pain but because I understand her pain.  And when they finally portray Tomoko's pain as pain instead of dark humor it really resonates with you.  But only if you can stomach watching a really pitiful girl.  The extreme darkness of the humor can easily turn a lot of people off.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I have to say about WataMote is that a lot of other people, including the show itself, claim that the story is a trivial one that eventually leads to nothing.  Throughout the whole thing there is pain, pain, and more pain.  Where's the payoff?  There isn't any.  The story is too realistic to offer something like payoff.  However I don't believe at all that the Tomoko at the beginning of the story is the same one at the end of it.  WataMote has one of those endings that when you first see it it seems like nothing, but if you give it another good hard look you can see that Tomoko changes a lot at the end.  To me, the ending is the payoff of everything and it is massive payoff.  It's a great and very realisstic ending.  But it's not easy to see the payoff, only people who understand can probably see it, but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch WataMote?  In most cases an anime scored with a 9 might be an \"Absolutely\".  Not here.  As a matter of fact, I think most people would probably not like WataMote.  I think that only those quiet, anti-social, loners are the people who would praise WataMote the same way I do.  But all of you sociables probably want to avoid this one.  You might think you can sympathize with Tomoko, but sympathy won't carry you enough to ignore the flaws the same way relating to her can.",

            "content": "WATAMOTE -No matter how I look at it, It's you guys fault I'm not popular- is a comedy aimed straight at dysfunctional geeks, or former dysfunctional geeks, who can laugh at their own faults and take them with a grain of salt. Its gallows humor centers around a socially inept mess of a protagonist who goes through life repeating the cycle of self-embarrassment and loneliness while learning nothing from it, and garnished with anime and pop culture references and parodies. It's a show that hits painfully close to home for anyone who has social anxieties, yet playful enough that it remains morbidly funny rather thanbecoming straight-up depressing, most of the time at least. It's also pretty blunt about who's really at fault for all the main character's problems.\\n\\n\r\nOur social misfit of a protagonist is Tomoko, an unkempt antisocial teenager entering her first year of high school. Despite having difficulty with talking to the opposite sex and having hardly any friends in middle school, Tomoko convinces herself that she will become instantly popular after her high school debut. It goes without saying that this isn't the case. Instead, she ends up brooding, having odd fantasies, and lamenting the fact she isn't popular. She spends her days fading into the scenery and going unnoticed by her fellow students, except for her occasional bouts of awkwardness; her days off school are usually spent cooped up in her room. Still, she's determined to gain popularity among her peers, even if she has absolutely no clue how to go about accomplishing that goal. Cringe inducing awkwardness and hilarity ensue.\\n\\n\r\nMajority of the show's humor comes from Tomoko's breathtaking ineptness. Not only does she have trouble talking to people, she has no sense of how to handle social situations at all. On top of that, she's also pessimistic and has a really dirty mind. Consequently, she constantly misinterprets even the simplest of interactions and blows them out of proportion; sometimes putting a sexual twist on them. A single kind gesture from a boy sends her into hilariously ludicrous fantasies of that boy having having a crush on her and becoming her boyfriend, even if there isn't a single indignation that he is actually interested in her. She comes up with half-baked ideas how to get noticed by her classmates which either go unnoticed or cause her embarrassment, even as she has overblown daydreams of becoming the most popular girl in class. She even botches an attempt to impress her visiting younger cousin, who had actually admired Tomoko until this particular visit. It would be depressing (actually, it still sort of is) if it wasn't for how clearly deluded Tomoko is (she takes social ques from anime), and the show's unhinged presentation of her delusional fantasies and social ineptitude.\\n\\n\r\nThe irony in this is, despite coming up with harebrained ideas to get her classmates' attentions, Tomoko rarely tries to interact with them normally. Instead of actually attempting to get acquainted with her fellow students, she just mopes around and daydreams about having friends. Of course, this is partly due to shyness, but Tomoko actively avoids interacting with people. She's also jealous, and even a bit spiteful, towards people more popular than her. Tomoko's loneliness is something she brings upon herself, if even just partly. Of course, she's unaware of this; propelling the show's morbid laughs as she runs around in circles.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you may have noticed Tomoko is the only character I've mentioned so far. This is because she is very much the essence of the show; she is horribly pathetic and self-centered and incredibly counter-productive, yet somehow surprisingly sympathetic. Her desire to become popular, warped as it is, comes from a genuine place. Beneath her unkempt appearance and unsocial demeanor, she's a confused teenager looking for someone to connect with. As funny as her misfortunes can be, and they can be pretty damn hilarious, there's an underline melancholy to them. This resonate strong for anyone who has had crippling social anxieties like Tomoko. What makes WATAMOTE a breath of fresh air is that it is able to spin these negative feelings into something fun to watch. The show's manic energy and countless silly references to other anime (K-ON, Fist of the North Star, and Another just to name a few), which usually take form in Tomoko's delusions, keep the humor from being overwhelmingly bleak... most of the time, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show have significantly less attention, which isn't surprising given the nature of the show, but add extra flavor to the show as they interact with Tomoko. In complete opposition to Tomoko's high school experience, her best friend from middle school Yuu (her only friend, really) has made a full transformation from quiet shy girl to a trendy, fashionable girl. Unlike our protagonist, she's friendly and sociable and actually pretty sweet; even with her new found popularity she makes time for her unsociable middle-school friend whenever she can. It's rather funny to see the striking contrast of the separate paths the two took after middle school. There's also Tomoko's younger brother, who always seems to be at the butt of Tomoko's shenanigans at home. Their vague animosity towards each other mirrors that of an actual sibling relationship, something that is oddly rare in anime. Late in the series, there's also a character that gives Tomoko a much needed hug.\\n\\n\r\nDirector Shin Oonuma has a very busy visual style, constantly throwing colorful and weird imagery into scenes; a habit that has been unnecessary in some of his previous works. This fits WATAMOTE like a glove, however. Tomoko has a very skewed outlook on life and an equally as overactive imagination; Oonuma's manic direction does wonders to illustrate this. Sometimes this comes in little touches like many of the characters having minimal detail in their designs, or Tomoko slowly becoming transparent and fading into the background. Other times it takes form in delirious spectacles, such as any of Tomoko's ludicrous fantasies. Also adding the unhinged visual design is the oddly angled lighting and color schemes and visual windows into Tomoko's thoughts. Tomoko's character design itself is cute in a dirty abandoned puppy kind of way; giving her some major icon power. You get the feeling that she would look pretty good if she actually took care of herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is on the zany side. It's reminiscent the usual light music used in high school comedy anime, but with a distinct oddness to it that works well with the visual design. The real attention catcher, however, are the show's opening and ending themes. The show has several different ending themes; all of which are both fun to listen to, and a little crazy. The main ending theme is preformed by Tomoko's seiyuu, Izumi Kitta (who does an incredibly job in the role), and fits the character perfectly. The opening theme is a blast of hard-rocking energy that is accompanied by visuals that encapsulate the show's themes and change slightly as the show continues. It is easily one of the best anime openers in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nWATAMOTE doesn't live to the likes of Welcome to the NHK or The Tatami Galaxy, which feature similarly dissatisfied protagonists, because Tomoko ultimately doesn't grow or develop much at all by the end. The show itself says that \"her story doesn't really matter\". However, perhaps because of this irreverence, the show is gigantically entertaining. While social anxieties are certainly a serious issue, there is something refreshing about having a show that centers around them not take itself seriously. The show isn't trivializing such anxieties or even making fun of them. It's simply inviting the viewers to laugh them off.",

            "content": "Before you decide to watch this show, make sure you do the following:\r\nFirst, lock your windows, close the blinds, and make sure you're in an isolated location (preferably soundproof). Also, have plenty of supply of water ready. Oh and don't forget some cough medicine. Now you're probably asking yourself, \u201cwhy??\u201d The answer is simple:\r\nYou're going to be laughing so damn hard in this series like you've never ever before.\r\nWatamote, aka No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys\u2019 Fault I'm Not Popular!, is an animated series based off the manga of the same name written by Tanigawa Nico. The series chronicles the lifeof an antisocial girl named Tomoko Kuroki. It depicts the every day life of this young girl as she finally becomes a high school student. The problem? She is literally an otaku with no social experience with no real friends, much less a boyfriend. Well, now that might be something that not any of us wants to be in the shoes of but for Tomoko, it's what she has to go through every single day of her life.\\n\\n\r\nFor Tomoko, she is what represents the antithesis of a high school girl. While most girls in high school already have friends and are looking forward to the dating cycle, Tomoko is still in the baby stage of her making a real friend. (a boyfriend would obviously be better but I think that might be out of her league for now) Tomoko has always being a shy girl throughout her childhood and has a problem of getting along with others socially. In fact, her social skills are so below average that through flashbacks, we see she has only made three actual \u201cconversations\u201d with her peers. But hey, it's high school so the opportunity to shine is now right? WRONG. For Tomoko, it doesn't seem like much has progressed. She is still stuck as an antisocial girl with zero experience in socializing. She often has thoughts in her head too that are filled with delusions about others. For instance, she often fantasizes what it would be like if she really was popular. These delusions expands on her being the queen, majesty, or some sort of celebrity in her own mind. Other times, she pictures herself in a world of her own where she is the ruler and the subjects are those 'popular kids'. Unfortunately, she often mixes the wrong way between her fictions and reality. These usually result in consequences...mostly getting herself embarrassed or humiliated. \\n\\n\r\nWhat impresses me most about her character is that Tomoko is very relatable. In fact, most of her life situations can be traced to our own childhoods. In fact, some of you reading this might be one of those folks who were once antisocial yourself. There's a line though between being antisocial or just a nutcase. In Watamote, Tomoko takes it to the extremes through her behavior. She has a love for BL games, often gets ideas from the manga/anime she is in love with, and always seems to say or do the wrong things at the wrong time. (mostly anyways) Furthermore, Tomoko seems to have a perverted mind as well as she fantasizes about genders of both sexes. In particular, her 'friend' Yui is a target of those  perverted thoughts as she plays strange imaginations in her head. \\n\\n\r\nThe series follows a slice of life format so don't expect any form of arc going on. What you should expect though is Tomoko's progression as she tries to climb out of her shell in terms of being the antisocial kid. She doesn't have any real friend and seems like High School isn't getting any better. In fact, her vow to become more popular is played as parodies with each of her attempts. These usually are plans played in her head that often doesn't seem to go the way she wants to. Tomoko's reliance on the knowledge she gets from anime, manga, and in the otome game world doesn't help her at all. Although it's played as a parody most of the time, there are moments where we may also feel sorry for her. Why? Perhaps it's because we might have been in the same situation before. In fact, there is probably one moment in life where you feel like you just can't succeed in something no matter how hard you try. In the end, you realize it might all be pointless. For Tomoko Kuroki, it's something she has dealt with many times in her life. \u201cWhat's the point?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTomoko's relation with her family is surprisingly quite realistic; at least at first glance. She has caring parents whom often cares for her daughter despite them not knowing of her way of life. Tomoko's younger brother Tomoki Kuroki is also portrayed as being just what a younger brother might be like in the real world \u2013 impatient, reserved, and often brutally honest. Throughout the series, we clearly see that the two of them behaves like siblings because of the way the argue. Some of these are based off of normal norms while other times are related to almost no reason. Regardless, it's realistic in my point of view because siblings always gets into fights no matter what. In fact, if you had a sibling, wasn't there at least one time where the two of you disagreed over something? (even if it's completely pointless?)\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we later meet another character who served as an 'old friend' of Tomoko. Unlike Tomoko though, she significantly changed not only physically but also in terms of her personality. She represents what Tomoko is not \u2013 pretty, cheerful, and sociable. It's sad to see Tomoko being compared to such a person throughout the series because the gap in their differences. Furthermore, she seems to have accomplished a goal in her life that has been an obstacle that Tomoko tried to overcome all this time. Sometimes, you just have to feel sorry for her. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea and originality of Watamote isn't as fresh as some people might think though. Recent series such as My Romantic Comedy SNAFU also depicts a young boy with delusions and being antisoical while being acquittance with a beauty. Other series such as Welcome to the NHK and The World God Only Knows also depicts the otaku culture with an antisocial character and being unpopular with their peers. The highlight to Watamote though is that Tomoko is an extreme case but also struggles to overcome her obstacles in a more humorous way. The way Tomoko is portrayed often shows that she is stuck in a labyrinth of her own problems. There seems to be no way out for her because of various reasons. These reasons are often humorous but if we take them to the real life world, it can be a serious problem. Regardless, I find Watamote and its portrayal of Tomoko's character to be very entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of the series are also the highlights. There are references being made to pop culture as well as other popular anime/manga series. Sometimes though, I feel like the show is trying a bit hard or more repetitive than it should be. Tomoko's quest to become more popular in high school might also frustrate viewers especially those who wants her to succeed. Then finally, Watamote might also be a painful watch especially for those who has truly been in Tomoko's shoes before. It makes some of us look back and tell ourselves, \u201cwow, I think I've been there before..just look at me now\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWatamote's artwork overall is painted with a simple style. Tomoko's character is probably the most noticeable. The way she looks isn't what some people might call 'attractive'. Rather, she is designed in the way an antisocial kid might be like. Her long hair, bagged eyes, and way she dresses shows that she isn't the typical valley girl. In fact, she doesn't use makeup or spent hours doing her hair in the morning. Silver Link adapts the manga well for the visuals just the way it ought to be \u2013 straight forward and simple. \\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack goes, Watamote's OP song, Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui by Konomi Suzuki n' Kiba of Akiba is extremely noticeable with its combination of rock and metal cords. Along with the strange appeal to her character, the song depicts Tomoko as a kid who doesn't fit with the popular crowds. The OST of the show is pleasant and often times plays noticeable tones of its soundtrack during certain scenes. These usually include moments when Tomoko gets caught up in awkward moments. The ED contains several different styles but all of them are portrayed as humorous and awkward. Finally, I would like to give praise to Tomoko's VA Kitta Izumi for her role in this series. Her voice as Tomoko truly shows that she is antisocial girl with no social skills and troubling delusions. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this show is one hell of a fun ride. I forgot the amount of times I had to screenshot those hilarious moments involving Tomoko. It brings about the humor of what an antisocial girl might be like in the case of Tomoko. Although the series does take it a bit to the extreme at times, I find it funny to watch because it pokes fun at the idea. In fact, the idea of being antisocial is often portrayed as a serious consequence. And indeed it is but in Watamote, the show gives off more of a humorous experience in the eyes and shoes of Tomoko. It's not a good thing to be antisocial or delusional but this show portrays it in such a way that you can't sometimes help but laugh. (at least I did) I hope you get a good laugh from this series as well. High school experiences might not be something we all enjoyed in our lives but it's certainly an important part of our memories. For Tomoko, that might not be appealing but this series sure was.",

            "content": "What happened? Watamote was a series about this socially retarded girl who came across with some social situations and acted retarded. Then what happened? This same thing over and over. Social situation, then retardation. This happened few times, then few times again and in the end few times happened few times too many, and that is what happened. \r\nMain points where this anime fails are pacing, character development and plot. 1-cour series can achieve a lot, but Watamote didn't even try to get anywhere. Many criticize Slice of Life series for being pointless, even state that Slice of Life is meant to be pointless, butin Watamote's case, it's mainly just waste of potential. Watamote had the key elements to be the NHK with OreImo funfun, but someone thought it would be cool to start repeating the same stone age joke till nausea, and it sure was. (Stone age and nausea, not funfun).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are meeting my picture of laziness. Kuroko is pathetic, a no-life loser and more importantly, a characters which is easy to develop in whatever direction. ... NOPE. Let's have a character who is the same person always, and an annoying one too! This formula works in fighting tournament shonen, but not here. Never here. Her brother reminds me of an alpaca. Always that stupid fucking face. By alpaca I mean that one guy from Twilight. There is other character too, but they won't matter, except that one senpai girl from the last episodes. She is interesting, why won't they make an anime about her instead of this little fucker? \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the animation and art, Watamote does a good job not being like all the other recent school series, so it passes. If we ignore the glorious op, the music is forgettable. Same thing with voice acting when ignoring her (you know, her) squeaking voices. Nothing impressive nor disappointing in the production, just the typical neutral nothing.",

            "content": "Now I want to preface this by saying I'm not strictly reviewing the series. I find it hard coming from my perspective to be able to objectively rate the show overall. This is because I believe that whether you like or dislike this show heavily depends on how much you can relate to the main character, therefore your mileage my vary.\r\n**The impressions I give do contain some minor spoilers however I do not believe they effect your enjoyment of the show**\r\nThe reason I really like Watamote is because it takes a particularly dark and depressing condition and gives it a light-hearted twist. See many peopleseem to misinterpret Tomoko (the MC) as being introverted, however I have to respectfully disagree. Being introverted does not mean that one is socially inept, as Tomoko is. Instead it means that the introverted person in question is energized by doing things by themselves but are quickly tired when participating in things involving a group. While it can be somewhat true that those who prefer to spend time by themselves are not as socially able as extroverts, it is not the 'default' for an introvert to be bad at conversations or unable to recognize social ques.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has experience with social anxiety in the past I can tell you that Tomoko most certainly suffers from social anxiety herself based on her actions throughout the series. Indeed her main goal through the show is to have lots of friends and be the interest of all the boys. If she was truly an introvert this would be in conflict with the idea that she wants to be the center of attention and be at the social peak of the high school she goes to. I feel like this needed to be explained because some dislike towards this show comes from people perceiving her as being an introvert and then subsequently stating that her behavior is unrealistic and exaggerated because 'introverts aren't like that'. Your enjoyment of the show will be enhanced if you can recognize that she has social anxiety, she is not introverted. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind I want to say just how accurately the show depicts social anxiety at it's worst. Tomoko frequently struggles to even say 'Hello' or 'Goodbye' to any of the characters in the show despite them actually being more than willing to interact with her. This really is an accurate representation in my opinion. For someone with social anxiety just saying things as simple as hello and good morning are monumental tasks. Since I can relate to this it is one of the main reasons that Watamote resonates so much with me. See Watamote takes this experience and others like it and utilizes the animation and sound to make it comedic, so that I can sit back and watch this show and laugh at all the unfortunate things that happen to Tomoko. It makes it so I can laugh at my own experiences and that really is relieving. It's nice to see such a condition portrayed in anime and not instantly be depressed by it which is a challenging thing for an anime to achieve and it adds a whole new level of appreciation for me towards Watamote and what it does. On one hand it gives an oddly realistic and mature look into the life of someone with social anxiety while simultaneously parodying it, which is fantastic. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this I really loved the fact that Watamote did not show Tomoko overcoming her social anxiety. One major criticism held against the show is that it does not have an overarching plot and the status quo that is set in episode 1 is still there by episode 12. While a series being too episodic is a valid complaint with many anime shows in recent years, I feel that Watamote is one of those anime that actually really benefits from being episodic. See social anxiety is not something that can simply be overcome in the period of a school term, shyness maybe, but social anxiety no. I feel like if Watamote had shown serious progression or even Tomoko outright beating her condition then it would have been unrealistic and immersion breaking. So for that I commend Watamote for not going down the idealistic route and instead sticking with the 'status quo' it portrays of Tomokos life. It really adds to my enjoyment of the show on the whole. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier your enjoyment of this show may heavily depend on how much you can relate to the experiences of Tomoko. If you can, then I highly recommend this show for you. If you can't, then you may still like it for its charming animation, good use of sound and quality 'cringe' humor. Equally however you may dislike watching a show that is basically about someone who can never do things right and is constantly messing up because of her warped view on events surrounding her. It's certainly not the best anime out there nor my favorite but to me it really had an emotional impact unlike any other anime I've watched making it worth noting for any anime fan.",

            "content": "I was all over this series when it first aired. Coming from someone who was in similar positions with Tomoko; its depiction of social reclusion and anxiety was perfect.  Even with a blatantly cheap budget, the series is able to vividly and impeccably flesh out Tomoko\u2019s character. Props to director Shin Oonuma as she makes the best out of her limited budget to use creative, well-directed visual tricks, that aren\u2019t simply used for show, but to further our understanding on Tomoko.\r\nAnother great factor about this series is that when it comes to depicting Tomoko, it takes us into her life without trying to conformthe viewer to a certain mindset. All the humor that stemmed from Tomoko\u2019s situations were funny, but in a cringe-worthily pragmatic manner rather than in a form of mean-spiritedness. And all those serious scenes of Tomoko were just to reflect on the quiet and heartbreaking moments of her instead of simply trying to force the viewers to sympathize with Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what many people claim, you don\u2019t have to have to relate with the female lead to enjoy Watamote. Yeah, it has its clever references to certain anime that casual viewers of anime won\u2019t get, but overall Watamote presents itself in a manner that anyone can enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, I was thoroughly impressed with Watamote at the start. The problem, as the series progresses, is that Tomoko\u2019s charm began to fade. I understand that the message the series conveys isn\u2019t about overcoming social anxiety, but how for many, it\u2019s a serious issue that may never be overcome. And though I like that message, it doesn\u2019t translate well into something I want to see for 12 episodes. Watching Tomoko monologue about her everyday life, even with all the novel and different situations she gets herself into, became stale. Even if I could still relate to Tomoko, it just wasn\u2019t of interest to keep watching and it didn\u2019t help that there was no firm direction or hint of what the series wanted to achieve in the end,\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, Tomoko isn\u2019t the lone character in the whole series, there are side characters like her only friend Yuu, her brother and a couple of other characters that make an occasional appearance. Yes, whether it\u2019s Tomoko trying to mirror what\u2019s popular or bickering with her older brother, Watamote is at its best with those moments and not when Tomoko\u2019s alone in her room. Because quite frankly, the show started feeling oddly empty and that didn\u2019t rub me the right way.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 Non-existent, it\u2019s episodic story-telling didn\u2019t work for me and there\u2019s no set direction of where it exactly wants to go\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 Tomoko is a fantastically depicted recluse, but her development is quite static. Side characters are great and bring out the best of the series, but lack more show time\\n\\n\r\nSetting \u2013 Its themes of recluse and social anxiety are well presented, but don\u2019t translate well into a vastly entertaining series\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values \u2013 Cheap, but is well made use of with incredibly creative and well-directed visual tricks\\n\\n\r\nDo I Recommend?:  Overall, I enjoyed Watamote for how it depicted a social recluse and I certainly enjoyed Tomoko\u2019s interactions with the real world, but in the end - with static development, scenes of monologue that felt empty and no real sense of direction - it was just another episodic comedy that didn\u2019t leave much of an impact on me. I commend the series for being open to viewers whether or not they relate to Tomoko\u2019s problems, but it\u2019s a very black and white series for the ones that do. You\u2019re either captivated by it or completely turned off by it. \\n",

            "content": "~No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys Fault This Review Is Not Popular!~\r\nBut either way it doesn't really matter since this show is here to accommodate for that. On the surface, the Watamote series follows the everyday life of our fellow heroine Tomoko Kuroki as she tries her hardest to become popular with her new high school life. With it, we are presented with everyday situations and how Tomoko deals with these events. \r\nMany factors such as the art and sound help to present these events in a comedic tone. You'll come across many references from anime today and a couple yearsback, and these references serve to emphasize on the theme of being unpopular. In addition, the soundtrack is filled with fun and high-spirited tunes that don't take it self too seriously and presents the mood that Tomoko is currently in. Not only that, but there are surprises to see within this soundtrack which I best should not mention. Furthermore, Kitta, Izumi really shines in her role as Tomoko, she is able to portray a voice that sounds crazy yet desperate but when it comes time for Tomoko to socialize with other characters, Izumi really stands out with her awkwardness. \\n\\n\r\nAs you watch this show, many of you will come to realize just how much Tomoko is like us. When I finished watching, I was left asking \"Did they make an anime based on my life?\"; the show's sense of humor could hit hard at home for many, which would either leave many cringing or leave you laughing at just how much you could relate to it. Tomoko is a dimensional character because of this, you'll feel her pain when things don't go her way or be happy when something good actually happens for her, and some of you may even despise her for the way she acts. But in general, without Tomoko, this show just wouldn't be the same at all. As for the supporting cast, they all fit into the story of Watamote without them feeling out of place. A notable character to highlight would have to Tomoki, he is like the opposite of Tomoko and when those two are together, the situations could get very funny or very painful. \\n\\n\r\nAt the heart, this show shouldn't be taken seriously, although many of us have experienced or still are experiencing the type of life that Tomoko has, it is meant to be taken in a humorous fashion, which could put off many. But if you're willing to look past that, then I assure you that Watamote is worth the watch, not every day would you be able to find a show as popular as this, no pun intended.",

            "content": "If you saw someone who is regularly alone, would you talk to or try to befriend him/her? Are you or did you used to be that lonely person? Or do you pity those type of people and tend to ignore them?\r\nWatamote is designed to give the viewer a taste of the daily life of such a person with an excellent mixture of reality and comedy. Prepare to enter the world of an introverted, socially inept girl named Tomoko, who desperately wishes to become popular and get a boyfriend. Depending on the person, Watamote can appear depressing, funny, or ridiculous. It may be difficult to laughat someone else\u2019s misfortunes and embarrassment regardless of whether or not it is fictionalized. However, it can draw several emotions for those who can relate. It gives you an opportunity to laugh at your own faults or sympathize with the character as she experiences loneliness and launch laughable schemes to get noticed.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9) / Character (9)\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is an Otaku who spends most of her time in the fantasy world. She visualizes her life being as glamorous as in her virtual dating games or favorite anime. However, she learns that popularity is not so easy to gain in high school. She survived middle school with one geeky best friend, but she must start from scratch as she attends school with complete strangers.\\n\\n\r\nThe reality and comedy is executed excellently as the anime follows Tomoko\u2019s daily life in social isolation. Her awkwardness and nervousness is what brings forth the comedy, because her attempts at popularity are kind of weird and hilarious. Tomoko tries to become more feminine and attractive to boys by changing her appearance, copying actions from anime protagonists, etc. Some scenes were exaggerated to create laughter. Tomoko\u2019s sudden reactions to certain occurrences, including being approached by a hot guy, are honest and comical.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who suffers from social anxiety disorder, Tomoko struggles to talk to strangers. Whether it is a simple hello/goodbye or ordering fast food, she speaks softly and stutters as if it\u2019s a pain. She shies away from several opportunities that could gain her a friend or improve her social skills. One part of the comedy comes from Tomoko bugging Tomoki (her popular soccer brother) to converse with her until she gets a boyfriend. The conversations are amusing with the weird subjects (e.g. Tomoko asking if he gets quickies from his female coach) and Tomoki showing his annoyance and disgust.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko\u2019s inner monologues greatly expresses her character. They involve honest feelings from cursing the happy people of the world or inspiring herself to try harder to socialize the next day. Tomoko\u2019s view of the world is that of a sim dating game or anime, causing her to have strange and inaccurate assumptions about the real world. Her time in the virtual world causes her to have perverted thoughts of what it\u2019s like to have a boyfriend. There are two or three ecchi scenes as Tomoko does both inner and outer research on how to become more feminine.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko slightly improves socially towards the end, receiving a little recognition from schoolmates. The ending is hopeful but disappointing for those who will expect immediate progress. It is yet another anime that urges you to continue the story with the manga because of its incomplete ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development goes at a steady pace for a shut-in like Tomoko, which is the reason for the incomplete ending. A faster pace would make the story unrealistic, since popularity cannot happen overnight. Supporting characters give a great contribution to Tomoko\u2019s development as she tries to gain self-confidence and hope for the future. Although the series strictly follows Tomoko, it goes inside the head of other characters and tells their thoughts of Tomoko. Some quotes from them are either funny or sympathetic. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8) / Sound (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are both memorable, underlining the anime\u2019s moody atmosphere. The animation is highly responsible for bringing out the comedy by creating an over-exaggeration of awkward scenes. Visuals portrays Tomoko\u2019s hallucinations and embarrassment with vivid colors, and her facial expressions constantly distorts to match her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was distinctly good. Tomoko is drawn exactly like an unappealing emo character with dark circles under eyes, long black hair, and plain clothes. Other characters\u2019 appearances are suitable for their nature. There are gray, colorless figures to express depression and loneliness in Tomoko\u2019s surroundings. Characters sometimes have faces with no eyes. Background designs are colorful and well-drawn. There are sometimes aerial views of a setting (e.g. inside a restaurant). Settings are diverse and brings excitement to the series, because each setting adds yet another incident to Tomoko\u2019s life.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song is a heavy metal song that\u2019s named after the anime itself, and the lyrics of \"Watamote\" describe Tomoko\u2019s character: \u201cI won\u2019t accept this world until I make it to a future where I\u2019m popular.\u201d There are five ending songs throughout Watamote, and they all match the moods to the ending of each episode. Background music sounds like a video game, so it's not that special. The VAs were very good and fit each character\u2019s personality. Izumi Kitta (voice of Tomoko) did an excellent job expressing Tomoko\u2019s nervousness throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) \\n\\n\r\nWatamote is one of the best slice of life comedies I have ever watched. I sympathized with Tomoko on several occasions and found her breakdowns funny most of the time. The animation and supporting characters brought excitement to the series by highlighting the different emotions (sadness, laughter) of the anime. The pacing also demonstrated hope for Tomoko. I was disappointed with the ending, but I loved it so much that I moved onto the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Watamote delivers a perfect combination of reality and comedy. It takes you on a ride through the life of a socially inept girl whose primary goal is to become popular. Sympathize with Tomoko as she goes through loneliness. Enjoy (and laugh) at her several crazy schemes to get people to notice her. \\n\\n\r\nTip: Watch the entire episode and enjoy the ED. After the credits, Tomoko and Tomoki converse for a few seconds about the main topic related to the next episode.",

            "content": "I simply wanted to say that Watamote is one of the most depressing anime I've ever watched. Just as I kept watching it, I couldn't stop wondering how much it would've took to reach the end. This anime has often been described to me as \"realistic\", \"relatable\" and \"funny\", and as a fool, I believed that it would've actually been a fun trip. It is even labelled as \"Comedy\" on almost every website.\r\nThe show itself is nothing but a lonley and geeky high-school girl ( Her name is Tomoko ) and her struggle to integrate herself into the society and make friends. At first, seemsrelatable towards the ones who have or had the same problems, but it truly isn't. The title itself says \"No matter how I look at it, it's your guys' fault if I'm not popular\", but it is actually Tomoko's own fault for being so bad, and isolated. Now, you'd expect such a character to be not cold nor hot, to have her issues but a positive side, something that we can say about her that would not be as we think... Instead, she's straight up rude, awkward and disrespectful, either with people she doesn't know or her own family.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just filled with sadness, all over it. Not a happy, or even NORMAL moment. For those who praise this anime for being \"realistic\" clearly didn't think this through, as the show is filled with clich\u00e9s and silliness. As an outcast and anti-social person, I can describe Tomoko's experiences past and present as totally unrealistic and odd. Like the fact that in an entire week of school, she had not shared a word with ANYONE exept a barely said \"Goodbye\" to her teacher. Which she took like a win to the lottery, by the way.\\n\r\nThere are also dozens of references to other anime, that are nowhere near subtle, as the only thing that stops from saying their respective name is a censorship *\"beep\"* in the dialogue. Not only some of these reference are out of place, but they are so obvious and in-your-face that I couldn't even enjoy or appreciate them, and I like parodies.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are basically clich\u00e9s and nonexistent, as this anime focuses only on one and one character only.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre, with good, but often overwhelming effects and lazy scenes that can easily be improved. The music can hardly be noticed, and barely adds any impact to any scene. Which is a shame, since the opening is absolutely awesome, and despite the ED isn't one of the best, it is very creative.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done, but when 80% of the dialogue are just inner thoughts coming from the main character, you can barely notice it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, no character, nor story development whatsoever. If I'd just put some percentage to sum it all up, it would be:\\n\r\n60% Depression\\n\r\n30% Random references to other shows\\n\r\n1% Actually relatable scenes\\n\r\n2% Of out of nowhere useless Ecchi you can't even predict \\n\r\nAnd 7% of western and anime clich\u00e9s spread around in random order.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend this anime, unless you really enjoy tragic \"comedies\" or find funny a depressed girl that threatens to kill herself if she doesn't talk to her brother once in a while.\\n\r\nSolid 3/10 and I'm being generous.",

The characters were well written and, even that I don't relate to her, Tomoko deserved to be a highlight.\r\nBut the story is what kills Watamote. Nothing happens during the series.

Watch with contentment.\r\nIf you answered yes to all of these questions, though, slap on some naked butler porn and start whacking with toothpaste at the prologue of Episode 1\u2014this anime was made specifically for you.\r\n(Psst. I answered yesto all of them.)\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWatashi ga mottenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga warui,\u201d\u2014or from hereforth Watamote\u2014would be equally as titled as \u201cThe Autobiography of the Narcissistic, Melancholic Otaku.\u201d It outlines the boring, waste-of-food lifestyle of an introverted, 21st century teenager, Kuroki Tomoko, and her misadventures in becoming a sociable person. With the lewd objective of capturing the hearts and souls of her peers, with each episode she draws forth a depressing, yet outlandishly hilarious conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in this anime is episodic, outlining the seasons of the school year more definitely as the series progresses. Tomoko struggles with communication, and all but too often winds up doing something socially awkward or unacceptable at little expense of notice to her colleagues. The series gradually draws towards more embarrassing or heartbreaking consequences, all-in-all while Tomoko remains spirited through to the narrow conclusion.  I strongly feel that the story itself is the weakest part and precisely why the series faces much scrutiny; the balance of the plotline heavily relies on a character that is distrusted by the audience, and rapidly grows repetitive with the endless frustration.  I think the series would have benefitted more with another arc, possibly more focused on the character changes that slowly developed as Tomoko\u2019s continued failures amassed.\\n\\n\r\nWhich in regards to the characters, this series shines. Tomoko is undoubtedly a relatable character to a part of all of us\u2014wherein we seek to blame others for our weaknesses, try to change too quickly, and excuse our dark thoughts with solidarity in loneliness. In my lifetime I cannot stress enough how often I\u2019ve thought along similar lines as Tomoko about my peers, only to realize in the end just how catastrophic that was to my personality. The consistent negativity and judgmental thoughts that she exudes are enough to make anyone feel sorry for her, if not additionally hate her.\\n\\n\r\nYet, brilliantly, she emblazons the series as the protagonist (or dare I say \u201canti-hero\u201d.) We watch her struggle to an end to become a happier person, sometimes even feeling proud that she has sought out meaningful changes. Also, considering her level of social anxiety it is fascinating watching her persist and continue to look brightly toward the future. After all we might choose to hate her, but are forced to love her. \\n\\n\r\nLaughing the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki, her brother, is another catch. Though he remains secondary and purely comical, he provides the audience a chance to see Tomoko act as herself. His shrewd responses and sarcasm add just the right amount of flavor. Though many disagree with me, I feel that this was enough to keep the focus on Tomoko alone, preventing her from being trapped in the inner monologue.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Kitta, did an astronomical job voicing for Tomoko. Being a good seiyuu is something expected out of Japan, but her mastery of inner monologue and conflict gave the series a bigger kick than had it been a higher-pitched tsundere. Voicing in a darker, messier timbre than a typical shoujo, Kitta employed the role with the right snappiness and vulgarity expected from a person like Tomoko. Also, her emphasis on certain words and sounds in Japanese (for those of you who don\u2019t speak Japanese just call me a name  and skip this part),  especially puns and sexual innuendos are outstanding. The general grit of her tone alone kept the series best in the balance.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening ranks high on my top 10 favorites. I am a classical musician and absolutely hate scream, yet I am enamoured with this opening.  The 1 minute and 30 seconds of clashing drum sets, vein-popping growls, and echoing female vocals are accompanied by a vignette of Tomoko\u2019s personal struggle. There is a great deal of innuendo of sexual repression and symbolism that is profound to this series. I strongly recommend to everyone to not skip the introduction when watching this series, as it will constantly refresh you about the deepest meaning of the series itself.  The background music is perfect, too. It actually is quite unnoticeable, maybe perhaps for a few weird, sexualized beats, elevator music or accordions. For a series of this nature I think stronger BGMs would make the subject too lighthearted, which defeats the purpose of Tomoko\u2019s character study.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork in Watamote is bewildering.  The splash of light effect and heavy detail on the eyes deceives us to believe that the series is meant to be cute. It, of course, does have many cute moments, but the choice of ambiguously dark colors or animation methods (such as crayon during imaginary scenes) retains the moody quite well.  There is a great amount of detail on the passage of time, as we see emphasis on Tomoko\u2019s moods reflect the time of the day.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, if you\u2019re afraid of seeing disgusting or repulsive behavior from your protagonist, then go watch cheap, direct-to-video Christmas films. Watamote thrives on less perfect minds and hearts, engaging them as It does Tomoko about her issues and choices.\\n\\n\r\nAnd again, make sure your naked butlers are well\u2026nevermind.\\n",

            "content": "An unfortunate truth that many fans of this medium can agree on is this: anime is generally not especially keen on addressing topics like social anxiety or giving them the respect and nuance they deserve. This is not to say this sort of thing doesn\u2019t exist, just that it\u2019s particularly hard to find. WataMote is an outlier, in how it confronts a legitimate issue and portrays it with utmost honesty, while utilizing comedy as a source of amusement and coping, not to make light of the situation. Through a collection of gags conjured in a fundamentally bleak scenario,  WataMote finds amusement and humor ina portrayal of anxiety which rivals that of Evangelion. Perhaps one of the worst, cruelest things to be imposed on someone is the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Shyness can look cute on the outside, but the same can be said about an animal trapped in a zoo. Both sheer hilarity and blistering tragedy ensue in Kuroki Tomoko\u2019s cavalcade of mishaps, exploring the multiple facets of her character which speaks to the hearts of those who have had the displeasure of feeling invisible to society.\\n\\n\r\nVarious monologues, delusions, and fantasies are at play here as we follow Kuroki Tomoko in her quest to become popular. Having almost no social skills whatsoever, much of the action takes place within Tomoko\u2019s own thoughts, from scheming on how to approach a situation to conjuring an ideal fantasy where all her desires are met, sometimes referencing an anime or manga she knows of. Tomoko is genuinely a fun and endearing character to follow, partly thanks to how vividly and creatively her thoughts are presented. Her point of view is depicted in a litany of wacky and comical ways, with each affair being executed in a way that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a battle shounen; exaggerated and dramatic. To say that WataMote plays out like a battle shounen undersells it however. Unlike many manga adaptations which tend to have uninspired camerawork and lazy implementation of dialogue, WataMote is always exercising creativity in how to present her thoughts. New visual elements are constantly brought to the table so that the experience never grows stale. Inventive visual work, snappy pacing, and Tomoko\u2019s constant narrations work in unison to bring this character to life.\\n\\n\r\nDespite depicting these situations in a goofy, comedic light, WataMote presents one of the most accurate depictions of social anxiety I\u2019ve seen in an anime. This portrayal is not limited to simply being nervous or shy in public interactions. Tomoko\u2019s thoughts, perspectives, and attitude all personify that of a socially awkward and anxious high schooler, serving as a basis for her actions. The way her anxiety dictates what she thinks and how she behaves is exploited both comedically and narratively, leading to events which highlight the tragedy of the situation while providing some degree of amusement. All of Tomoko\u2019s delusions and insecurities are welded into a series of gags and humorous moments to exploit the absurdity in her ways of thinking, while eloquently demonstrating what exactly is crippling her in these situations. Feeling nothing but fear and distrust in social situations, Tomoko almost always assumes the worst in people. Internally, she\u2019ll often scoff at or antagonize anyone who isn\u2019t some hot guy she met at a store, and impulsively puts the blame on others for any misfortune that comes up in her day. She\u2019ll desperately gravitate towards any method that is said to make one more popular, attractive, or whichever else, even if it involves purposely getting molested on a train. And yes, she does actually attempt this. The various incidents she pulls herself into are presented in a wacky, hyperbolic manner, sometimes to the point where Tomoko comes off as downright maniacal or demented in certain cases. This particular style does a lot to make Tomoko a very endearing character, but she\u2019s made all the more captivating by how she fully encapsulates what social anxiety is really about. It\u2019s a harrowing dilemma to face especially in your high school years, and it\u2019s one that many of us can admit to have had around the same period as Tomoko has. Almost all of us who have had social anxiety can relate to many of Tomoko\u2019s ordeals, which can possibly bring back painful memories of our own. WataMote subjects us to the bleak and dreary realm of social anxiety and the consequences of having it, amplifying the absurdity of the situations that stem from it to soften the blow. In spite of this glossy exterior, WataMote is made fully aware of the situation and gives it the integrity and nuance it deserves, just as a black comedy should.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary method of which WataMote delivers its humor is by stressing the dichotomy between how Tomoko perceives the world compared to how it actually is. This is the format which pervades the entire show; the reality, often lukewarm and indifferent to Tomoko, is twisted in such a way to abide with her own insecurities. Tomoko constantly deludes herself into believing that she is above everyone else, and it\u2019s portrayed to be rather pitiful, yet still funny and amusing. Consider this scene as an example: on a rainy day, when Tomoko finds that her umbrella is missing, she instinctively assumes it to have been stolen. She then has an internal rage about how she is an innocent victim whose day was ruined by this abominable crime. Then, she stops to realize that her umbrella was just a few feet in another direction. This is a funny moment on its own, but it\u2019s also a perfect example of how Tomoko operates outside the comfort of her own home. When something seemed to be wrong at first, she instinctively assumes it to be another\u2019s wrongdoing, without taking even a second to consider any alternative.\\n\\n\r\nThings that seem relatively mundane and trivial to us are made into a much bigger deal than they need to be. This exact way of thinking is what leads Tomoko into numerous awkward situations involving other people, which is exactly what blocks her off from others. Her rationale is purely based on knee-jerk suspicions rather than logic, some of which are understandable to at least some degree, such as worrying about what classmates will think about the sight of you eating alone. Others can be quite outrageous or downright unfathomable, such as the notion that wearing certain underwear makes you friends more easily. Both of these can be attributed to how someone with social anxiety really operates. Tomoko\u2019s antics come in a seemingly endless variety, as new situations arise after another and more inspiration is attained. Because we are given a thorough introspective on what possesses her to take these actions, it\u2019s made easy to gravitate towards Tomoko and understand what she does, as irrational and ludicrous as they are most of the time. The sad truth of the matter is, as over-the-top and balls-to-the-wall as it\u2019s all portrayed to be, it\u2019s conceptually accurate to how some of us behaved in our adolescent years. Both these factors are what effectively put us in her own shoes, making it all the more uncomfortable to watch when these actions actually follow through, there to be witnessed by outsiders. This discomfort is a large part of what makes it funny, yet oddly impactful on a personal level. I for one can admit to have operated along the same lines as Tomoko in my own school years, and I imagine plenty of others are the same way. Whether you have fully grown out of this phase or are still in the process of doing so, laughing at yourself is a good first step towards moving on with your life.\\n\\n\r\nThis is even the case with her own family as well as her best friend Yuu-chan. Even though they, particularly Yuu-chan, are relatively close to her, they are not exempt from witnessing the crazed antics Tomoko stirs up on a daily basis. Her brother Tomoki serves as a test subject of sorts, as Tomoko uses new bizarre methods of communicating to see how they play out. Tomoki, like everyone else, has no idea what the hell goes on in Tomoko\u2019s mind, and thus wants nothing to do with whatever nonsense she subjects to him. Tomoko\u2019s interactions with her mother go about as smoothly as those with anxious teens who feel as though nobody understands them would expectedly play out with their parents. Yuu-chan, being the only character besides Tomoko\u2019s parents to give her unconditional support and attention, ends up being one of the most likeable characters on offer. Tomoko even still projects herself into Yuu-chan and holds her on the same standards. Yuu-chan\u2019s presence, compared to how she once was, as an attractive, well-endowed specimen with many healthy relationships is an abhorrent sight to Tomoko. What Tomoko feels could be described as a feeling of betrayal, or rather severe envy. Tomoko\u2019s twisted and misguided view on people erects yet another barrier around even her best friend. Luckily for her, most of anything Tomoko would usually do comes with almost no repercussions when around Yuu-chan. Tomoko\u2019s company with Yuu-chan is relatively painless and refreshing compared to that of other people, as Tomoko is rarely wound into such humiliating incidents. In a way, seeing these characters together is somewhat euphoric. Nonetheless, there is still much awkwardness to be be found among their interactions, as Tomoko\u2019s insane ideas run amok even still. Tomoko\u2019s interactions with these characters are very distinct from one other, which makes Tomoko feel more like an actual person and makes each encounter with them very unique. As a result, WataMote is given plenty more sources of comedy at its disposal and makes Tomoko\u2019s moments involving them varied and original.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all these shenanigans at play, WataMote doesn\u2019t shy away from providing full, unfiltered attention to Tomoko\u2019s dilemma when it needs to. Whenever Tomoko is legitimately hurt or grief-stricken by what happens, the show seizes to pull any punches at that point. The limelight is positioned squarely on her humiliation and anguish, often laying a somber melody upon the scene; she even sheds tears at some points. These moments might as well be climaxes, as she is in a position where no ounce of delusion can divert her from the crude reality of what she\u2019s led herself into. WataMote understands this disorder which Tomoko is bound by, and knows full well when it is no longer a laughing matter. The absence of comedy during these moments is enough to draw attention to how affected Tomoko really is; yet another factor of what makes her so easy to feel for. Of course, once these moments pass, the proper course of action is not to dwell on those past situations, but to shrug it off, move on, and hope tomorrow will be better. And this is exactly what WataMote does. The moment follows through, the whole arc fades into a somber close, and the cycle begins anew. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show\u2019s structure is based around repetition, WataMote is not exempt from providing actual character development. The actions Tomoko takes do in fact affect what she does in future events. Additionally, as the show draws into its later half, Tomoko\u2019s denial lessens while she gradually becomes more accepting of her dilemma. Her life concurrently becomes more bleak and hopeless as a result. This is the point where her actions, while still less than ideal, become significantly more reasonable, as she makes a conscious effort towards amending her newly found flaws. This development comes across very naturally; there\u2019s nothing drastic or sudden about this change. It comes in minimal pieces as Tomoko retains what she has experienced through her mishaps. Of course, she never truly unbounds herself from the self-destructive tendencies we see throughout. As we all know, it\u2019s incredibly easy to fall back to old habits.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to see that if Tomoko was a person in real life, she would not be a fun person to interact with or be around, but that doesn\u2019t make her struggles any less real. Despite how abrasive and hostile she is portrayed to be overall, Tomoko is a character who is easy to sympathize with, because the full context of her troubles is made very clear. While not exactly universal, experiencing this kind of distress is something very many people can identify with. Because of this, we immediately understand her actions, even if we don\u2019t find them to rational in any sense. Her life is very empty and miserable, affirmed all the more through her constant denial and acts of desperation. We want her to succeed, and thus seeing her get into humiliating situations through her own doing is genuinely an unpleasant experience. It just goes to show how coming out of your shell is never an easy task for anyone. Whatever Tomoko suffers through, we are forced to suffer through with her.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads into what is perhaps the most common criticism towards WataMote. For many people, WataMote is a very uncomfortable, cringe-inducing experience. I would be one of the first to agree that the show is certainly uncomfortable at many points, but I would also say that it is so for the right reasons. Some say it\u2019s uncomfortable for the reason that Tomoko is unlikeable, which is obviously something I disagree on quite strongly. Others say it\u2019s for the reason that they don\u2019t want to see Tomoko go through these miserable affairs. As mentioned previously, despite how frequently and badly she fucks up, there is change in her character to be found along the way. While not always necessarily positive, it\u2019s still change nonetheless. These small changes show that there is legitimate hope for her. For this reason, it\u2019s made all the more cathartic and heartwarming when Tomoko really does manage to find a fair bit of comfort towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does she reflect nearly every facet of the usual social awkwardness that resides in many high schoolers, she\u2019s also a funny and charming character independent of that. Her antics are unpredictable and she\u2019s endearingly quirky through each passing episode. She is voiced extremely well in the Japanese audio as well as the English dub. Of course, a considerable factor in what makes Tomoko so appealing to many is her visual design itself. Her small stature and baggy, half-open eyes make her look rather cute with an element of mischief, which is perfect for the character. The way she constantly and drastically changes into different expressions is a huge factor in what makes this character so funny and loveable through each of her schemes and shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how commendable the design of Tomoko really is, it\u2019s a shame that her design is the only memorable one in the entire show. Almost every other character is rendered to a bland default anime design with very little distinguishing qualities. This is excusable for background characters, but the more important characters don\u2019t fare much better. Yuu-chan\u2019s design has only her yellow hair and well-endowed physique to make her stand out from the rest. Even Tomoko\u2019s own family suffers from a lack of inspiration in their design. It\u2019s unfortunate that this is how it turned out to be, but it could also just further affirm how remarkable the design of Tomoko really is.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the visual department on the whole is something to be admired. The backgrounds are bold and daring, which makes the scenery very eye-catching and vibrant. The animation is very fluid, especially when it really needs to be. Never did I feel as though the animation quality was ever lacking through any of my viewing experiences. Perhaps the most unique and notable aspect of the visuals is how the lens flares are designed. Light sources like the sun always produce flares that take the form of angular shapes. There isn\u2019t a particular rhyme or reason for this design choice, but rather it serves to further enforce the cartoony nature, which is perfectly welcome in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSo when you think of \u201cself-insertion\u201d in anime, there\u2019s a good chance that conjures up images of an ideal fantasy world in which the protagonist is blessed with numerous desires and conflict is trivialized; basically your typical harem or isekai. WataMote is self-insert in a different way, where you connect Tomoko\u2019s various mishaps to that of your own. Once this happens, WataMote provides an experience few other anime could hope to emulate. It\u2019s hellbent on reaching that one specific audience it\u2019s directed towards, and does so marvelously. The \u201cthorned rose\u201d analogy is perhaps more applicable here than it is with any other show in recent memory. It is shame however that WataMote covers only a portion of its source material, meaning that an ideal conclusion for Tomoko isn\u2019t present here. This leaves the only hope of getting one to the manga itself, or perhaps a possible anime sequel. Regardless of this shortcoming, I for one am glad to have laughed, cried, cringed, and cheered through Tomoko\u2019s endeavors.",

            "content": "We\u2019ve all gone through a certain point in our lives where we just want to feel less lonely even though our abilities for social interactions are limited for some inexplicable reason. Shows that remind us of those dark times can be polarizing for the majority to comprehend and because of this we don\u2019t see many shows try to tackle the subject. The reason being the fact that most people don\u2019t like to revisit what made them so miserable for so long. Luckily for some of us, we always look back at those moments and laugh at how silly it was and thanks to the showWatamote we can now have a show that does that for us.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the gag manga, Watamote is set as your typical slice of life show, only this time they added some new twists into the mix that make it a little more fresh than others; dark demented twists so to speak. It is dark in its subject matter but at the same time it has a comedic overtone that compliment each other very well. You have Tomoko\u2019s wild intentions on wanting to be popular yet is unable to due to her supreme lack of social skill and the fact that she has been somewhat of a hikikomori for the majority of her life. The camera angles that constantly pans to her face that often looks distorted from the style of animation it tries to exacerbate really give you a sense of dread and anguish for her yet at the same time you can\u2019t help but laugh at her expense. The show also goes into parody territory by showcasing your typical awkward moment of conversation such as picking up a dropped pencil from a classmate sitting next to you and so forth. This is done with some clever flashback sequences that show us Kuroko\u2019s comprehensive mindset.\\n\\n\r\nSporadic and chaotic are the two words that sum up the humor of Watamote. This is a blessing and a curse to the show as a whole, in which the humor in this show is very unpredictable and goes to new levels of hilarity as time goes on but at the same time it can get quite repetitive quickly. Repetitive in the sense that Kuroko\u2019s constant ramblings and random noises she makes when she goes insane are done too frequently and mostly comes across as tedious than charming after a while. What does save the humor is the actual build-up of the most funniest bits that feel very fresh and unexpected to see thanks to the well-thought out dialogue that is written in those scenes; scenes that involve Tomoko and her mother in her room as her audio recording of a male seiyuu is played in the background and joining a couple of boys peek into a love motel.\\n\\n\r\nOne other small aspect that I truly admire about the comedy is the chemistry between Tomoko and her brother Kuroki and their hilarious dialogue exchanges to one another. Whenever the both of them are on-screen together, you get the actual feeling that this is how most siblings treat each other on a daily basis; they don\u2019t necessarily like each other when they are in their personal space but they\u2019re nonetheless bound by blood and can\u2019t help but feel for each others troubles. It\u2019s a shame they don\u2019t have enough screen-time together, that way we could see some growth between them but what we have here at this point is enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nTo start out with characters, Tomoko is the type of person you either grew up knowing someone like her or you grew up as her, but for the most part we\u2019ve all been the latter. We\u2019ve all just wanted to try to put up an act of ourselves to make us seem edgy or cool but end up failing miserably as a result. Tomoko herself is the main driving point in the show who performs her antics with pure charm and sympathy, thanks in part to her voice actress Izumi Kitta who is extraordinary playing as her. Her ability to create Kuroko\u2019s personality is almost inhuman in a good way, though there are some times where she performs her job too well to the point where it sounds like she\u2019s going to pass out near the end of the take.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the other characters share the same kind of memorability or charisma as Kuroko does, with the exception of her brother of course. Her best friend Yuu Naruse, played by Kana Hanazawa, is a pretty bland childhood friend type of character who isn\u2019t given much to her performance other than to show more of Kuroko\u2019s despair. Now one way to defend this is by looking at it as the fact that Kuroko is the only character that is the center focus of the entire show. The rest of the characters don\u2019t even have to be fully developed because all we are focusing is on the main character Kuroko alone. It gives off the same loneliness feeling that she is going through to let the audience feel the same thing to make us feel contempt for her sorrow. Then again that\u2019s what makes the comedy all the more meaningful and hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say the comedy is always perfect by any means. There are times where we\u2019re taken into situations that go a little too far and the comedic timing doesn\u2019t even provide any humorous feedback because of how poorly handled they are. Not that they were anything life-altering disturbing but it\u2019s one of those moments where you raise your one eyebrow and feel uncomfortable at the same time. While there are some hiccups here and there, the writing does jump back into the swing of things and provide endless over-the-top humor that is both dark and clever. The numerous parodies to other anime are a definite plus as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat better way to start out your typical slice of life show when you could just provide a loud bombastic metal song into it to make it edgy?  No doubt the opening might alienate people since obviously it feels out-of-place by the fact that the scenes being shown in the opening have absolutely nothing to do with the show. I would argue that it\u2019s heavily symbolic as if we\u2019re in Kuroko\u2019s own subconscious thought in how her thought-process is majority of the time and for that it\u2019s a pretty decent opening. The rest of the music is here is fun and nice to listen to, even though it will eventually be forgotten in about two years time.\\n\\n\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say that the show is very demented to watch and might leave people with a really sick feeling in their stomach, but it\u2019s something that anyone shouldn\u2019t pass off if they are a big fan of dark comedy and a parodied look into the otaku lifestyle. It can be a tedious ride if you can\u2019t handle the repetitive nature of Kuroko\u2019s random ramblings but there\u2019s always that one moment that makes the ride worth it to go through. A moment that makes you have tears roll down your eyes from sheer laughter and going absolutely nuts by how bold the humor can be observed as uncomfortable. After all, we need more admirable shows like Watamote that isn\u2019t afraid to go too far with its jokes.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B\\n",

Many people including myself have been able to connect themselves to the main character Tomoko in the sense of the frustrations that they have with feeling unknown to the rest of the world.\r\nWatching this series, with the relationship between Tomoko and her younger brother Tomoki it had me thinking about how I see my relationship with my own sibling and I, how even though they didn't get along they still share memories together and take the extra step to tolerate each other.\r\nAbove that, the interactions between the background characters that Tomoko had observed showsperspective on how unaware some people may be of the others around them, if they are lonely and need company or even need somebody to talk to.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the ending of episode 11 where the class representative in charge of the culture festival, Imae, noticed Tomko was lonely after her friend Yuu had left, then got in the mascot costume and offered her a balloon. When Tomoko went to take the balloon she pulled her in for a hug. That was one of the sweetest moments I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also introduces very interesting music and makes several humorous references to other popular animes. If anyone is looking to watch something a little different this is definitely the series to watch.",

            "content": "If you live under a rock, you\u2019re probably impressed by Family Guy\u2018s and South Park\u2018s \u2018dark\u2019 humor. They show you people suffering, dying and cursing. They expect you to laugh because people are dying, suffering and cursing. You\u2019re supposed to be shocked that the creators don\u2019t mind putting these characters though such a pain, but that\u2019s not a major achievement. Terrorists do it all the time, but it doesn\u2019t make them comedians.\r\nA truly dark comedy is not that one avoids that darkness. It\u2019s one that forces us to confront the darkness of it and still laugh. Even Borderlands, where the whole joke is that everyonethinks dying is a joke has insight into violence and how we perceive it. It\u2019s an exaggeration of the flippant treatment most video games have for violence. Likewise, WataMote is an anime that stares into the eyes of the abyss that is being socially retarded\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is a dark comedy. It\u2019s far darker than any so-called \u2018for adult\u2019 cartoons from the West. It doesn\u2019t create a bunch of punchlines and try to make the premise fit the jokes. It\u2019s aware of the how crippling Tomoko\u2019s situation is, and it tries to find humor among all the darkness. It uses humor not to downplay the darkness, but as a means of coping.\\n\\n\r\nShyness is cute when you look at it from the outside, but so is a panda bear caged in a zoo. Tomoko has the privileges of the Western world, such as running water and food. How much of a consolation is it when you have no way to relate to the world?\\n\\n\r\nHuman beings are social creatures. Isolation is one of the worst type of punishment you can bring on one. That\u2019s where solitary confinement comes from. Without feedback from others to keep us in reality, it can feel like it\u2019s slipping away from us. A similar process can happen with sensory deprivation.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what happens to Tomoko. There is a gross contrast between how she views herself and the world, and how it really is. The world outside is not very hostile. In high school, the popular kids are too busy having fun to bully you. People will talk to you if you initiate. At worst, they\u2019ll be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nIndifference isn\u2019t harmful in and of itself. It doesn\u2019t target you. When that\u2019s the only feedback you get, it becomes scary. Tomoko barely spends any time in the real world. We spend most of the episodes inside her head. In her inner monologues, she talks fast, with a steady pace and a hard voice. She\u2019s full of energy and life.\\n\\n\r\nThen she opens her mouth and barely a word comes out. The people often react in confusion. You can\u2019t expect them to react in any other way to a person who can barely utter a phrase. Since it\u2019s not complete approval, Tomoko\u2019s dualistic worldview sees it as negative and she runs away.\\n\\n\r\nThat dualistic worldview is another aspect of being a social retard. Tomoko sees things in black and white. There are popular kids, and losers like her. In her eyes, Yuu turned from a loser geek to a \u2018popular slut\u2019, although all we see is that Yuu developed breasts and dyed her hair. Tomoko tries a little to fit in, and when it doesn\u2019t work she throws the bathwater with the baby.\\n\\n\r\nThe absurdity of social anxiety is that it makes you fail in basic, day-to-day interactions. Tomoko\u2019s failures wouldn\u2019t bother and otherwise well-adjusted person. People say embarassing shit all the time. Most of them say so many things that one failure doesn\u2019t bother them. Tomoko always bets all her money on one single moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy comes from the darkness itself, from how absurd it is. We\u2019re talking about a barrier that doesn\u2019t exist physically. Nothing prevents Tomoko from talking with people but herself. She\u2019s fighting a shadow. Seeing a person fight something invisible is both sad and funny at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes the comedy is just from Tomoko\u2019s failures. Thankfully, the creators are imaginative enough. They make these realistic failures, rather than inserting a poop joke or a sex joke like a lot of Western comedy does. There is also a powerful use of silence. It\u2019s another way of pointing out the joke, but it lets the situation stand on its own. Besides, it\u2019s a more realistic reaction to absurdity. Something absurd is something we don\u2019t know how to react to. We may need time to think it over.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko would\u2019ve nothing without her voice actress. It\u2019s a brilliant performance. She has to play different characters. Tomoko is a megalomaniac world-dominator in her monologues but a coward when she speaks. Her voice actress doesn\u2019t just capture this World Dominator in her speech, but she performs it with chinks in the armor. She exaggerates the confidence so much that it\u2019s clear Tomoko tries hard to convince herself. As for how she does Tomoko\u2019s stuttering, I doubt any person can replicate it so well. The fact a dub was even attempted is a brave, but probably an Icarian feat.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design fares a little worse. Tomoko isn\u2019t really ugly. She looks odd and a distortion of the Moe design. Her eyes are huge, but have a darkness in them that looks frightening. Her figure or facial features aren\u2019t special enough to cause any shock. She looks likes she\u2019d rather listen to My Chemical Romance and Avenged Sevenfold rather than look for a boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThe state of comedy is a poor one. Too many comedies are references to sex and shit in-between random words. It\u2019s hard to find a comedy that understands comedy\u2019s purpose \u2013 finding humor in the absurdity of life. If it can find humor in the darker parts, then all the better. Whatever you think of anime in general, WataMote is a great work of comedy.\\n\\n\r\n4 anxiety fits out of 5",

Ok so the anime \"Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou KangaetemoOmaera ga Warui!\" has ended and I must say that it was a rather unique one since it is all about a typical Japanese loner\\ loser who doesn't seem to do anything by herself to improve her social skills. Frankly if I can compare this anime to a western cartoon the close that it would be is 'Ed, Edd and Eddie\" co'z both features a typical teenagers whom were pretty much losers in life that I would like to whack their heads with a rolled up newspaper, except in \"Ed, Edd, and Eddie\" I 'd give those characters some respect since they're the kind of losers who never stopped trying, while in \"Watamote\" the girl loser never tries at all. Ok so I think I'm gonna have to present my ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I did mentioned about this anime's uniqueness, since its slice of life was focus on Kuroki Tomoko a loner and pessimist who procrastinates a lot, her story simply represents the very thing that every loner does and what he/she wishes which either she becomes a hokikomori if he/she is unconsciously  contented of being a loner or eventually get a life and enjoy the world provided that such determination to change oneself is present. But in this case the story of the everyday life of a loser girl like Tomoko was more amusing that one would like to be the backseat character and criticize Tomoko for not having the guts nor the fortitude to even improve herself, also the story shows us that improvement is something that one must undertook by herself, that is, if there is really a determination for one to really improve.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nWell for Tomoko, at one point I'm a little bit disgusted about her illustration, attire and facial concept, but, I can't deny that it was those very concept that makes her funny. Also, there is a few fanservice that me likey, like Imae's one time panty shot and Yuu's big bouncing melons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for Tomoko which includes, the way she catches her breath, her evil smirk, evil tone and of course I also like the way that her brother's speaking tone when he get's piss off by her antics. Oh, and about the opening theme, it really doesn't fit the anime as a whole, unless thai anime has an intense action genre, in fact the closing theme fits better as an opening theme. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nI may be a bit pissed about the main character Tomoko, ok so she might have some aggression within her and her fantasies are too dark to comprehend, then again she's not bad to be this stupid loser high schooler, which the only types pf people she can get along with are kids and middle school perves. So the \"Decent\" score is for her.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Naruse, maybe Tomoko only friend or least when they were in middle school, but the thing about her is that she doesn't make any effort to change Tomoko and it's rather annoying, then again she does provide this hot bodacious babe that's present in every anime\\manga.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki on the other hand he is somewhat this character that I would like to give her sister a rude awakening, however just like Yuu he's also annoying that he doesn't do anything to change her sister, Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mom, what I like about her is the part that she has to give Tomoko a bitch slap because of Tomoko's stupid antics with the vacuum cleaner.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this is one anime where we the audience would like to be a backseat character who would wanna give the main character a rude awakening if she ever wants to have an enjoyable high school life. Also I did mentioned about the uniqueness about this anime that deals with a typical Japanese loser which can only go two ways; become a hokikomori if he/she is  unconsciously contented of being alone and blames the world for his fate or get a life if such determination to change exist in that particular person. Overall, this is one of the best anime for this season despite of its shabby final episode. The end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n l\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you think the main character of this anime is pathetic, two things can easily be concluded from that:\r\n1) You have a great life. Congratulations!\r\n2) You're an insensitive prick. Congratulations...?\r\nNow on to the review.\r\nSTORY : On the surface, this anime appears to be comedic tale of a loner who's desperate for attention and friends. Her situation is so bad that she can't even utter a word in public. That's it, right? No plot development, no clich\u00e9 transformation to a beautiful/popular girl, and no happy ending.\r\nNo, that's definitely not it.\r\nThis anime is about a girl with social anxiety. Being someone who suffers from social anxiety, althoughnot on as serious level as her, I can say that there's nothing funny or \"pathetic\" about suffering from social anxiety. Before you go and say: \"Come on! What's so bad about it? Just talk to people! Make friends!\", let me just make it clear that its impossible for shy people to easily communicate or indulge with friends easily because we're very conscious of ourselves and our surroundings. What about delusions and fantasies? That's also part of being a social failure, I can vouch for that.\\n\\n\r\nART : Brilliant. The character design, the background, everything about the art is brilliant. Couldn't find a single flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : Personally, I loved the opening and ending theme. The opening theme portrays the mind of someone suffering from anxiety perfectly. The anguish and envy in the song and Tomoko's expressions...ah, so accurate! Voice-acting was good, although you might need some time to get used to Tomoko's voice.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : The main character is fantastic. She's realistic and not all cutesy like most anime and that's just what makes her so awesome. Her relationship with her brother is also realistic and cute (at some points). Yuu-chan...erm, what can I say about her? She's a slut.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : I enjoyed it. I laughed at her misfortunes that often reminded me of my blunders in the past, and empathized with her dearly throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL : This anime is not for everyone, that is given. Watch it if you're going through the same thing and half laugh, half cry while watching it (like I did). Its definitely not for people who have lots of friends and/or look down on loners. Will this make you feel fuzzy and warm inside? No, it's uncomfortable especially if you can relate to her. But its realistic. I can't emphasize on this factor enough; not everyone has a perfect high school life, you know. A realistic anime once in a while won't hurt'cha, buddy.",

            "content": "I. Freaking. AM. This girl.\r\nI have struggled with social anxiety most of my life.  I've never felt like I belonged to part of a group, and I've always felt like more of a shadow than a real person in the eyes of others. I'm taking medication for it now, but that doesn't stop the pain of those memories.\r\nSo for me, Watamote was like reading a very embarrassing autobiography. I related to the main character, and it made me ashamed.\r\nFirst off, this anime is hardcore cringe comedy. You WILL have to pause the show at least once just because watching this girl fail is sopainful. You will scream no at your television, only for your plea to fall on deaf ears and Tomoko to humiliate herself anyways. It's not a feel good, chortle jubilantly whilst crunching on pocky sort of anime. It's a face-palm-and-shake-your-head-despairingly anime. If that doesn't sound like a roaring good time to you, then you should probably go watch Lucky Star instead.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Lucky Star, that's just one of the many anime Watamote references. Ghost in the Shell, Haruhi Suzumiya, Death Note, and a plethora of other shows are visually mimicked from time to time for your viewing enjoyment. Okay, that's a nice shout out to otaku, I guess. And I suppose it helps emphasize Tomoko's otaku nature. But I can't help but feel like this show is more preoccupied with imitating iconic images rather than creating its own. That's the danger when you rely to heavily on shout-outs and references: you leave no room to make your own impression.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is Watamote's visual failing. The animation is never bad, but it never goes beyond bare simplicity. You are ANIME, art incarnate, moving masterpiece, you shouldn't settle for mere passing. Watamote fails to create any sort of distinctive style of its own. It's bland. If you do not create images that stick in the mind of your audience, then you are going to be forgotten. Ironically, that's a lesson Tomoko is very aware of, and yet her own show fails to put it to use. So I must award you no points for style.\\n\\n\r\nBack to my own neuro-chemical failings: as someone with social anxiety, I understand what it is like to struggle to connect with people in a way that is meaningful. Watamote definitely got that message across. Unfortunately, it provides no light at the end of the tunnel, and thus ends up feeling somewhat hollow. Now, mental illness is a hard subject to portray, because it does not lend itself to a satisfying story-arc. You do not OVERCOME things like anxiety and depression. There is no final battle, no clear climax. Instead, it is a slow, uphill struggle. There is no end, because it's not something that ever goes away. That makes a satisfying conclusion almost impossible. A person can't just suddenly \"get better\" from internal struggles. If they do, it comes across as contrived and insincere (see the TV ending of Evangelion). Victory against mental struggles is so gradual that it can be hard to see, which is why it can be very unsatisfying for an audience to watch. \\n\\n\r\nWatamote falls into the trap of trying to show character development in a way that is thematically satisfying, but distant from real life. The conclusion of the show has some last-minute growth from our main character, probably in order to give its audience a freaking bone after all that torture. However, as someone who has struggled with this same issue (and as such as the likely target audience of the show), I know that sort of change doesn't happen. I don't want to see the main character be able to put aside all their anxiety with the click of a button, because I know that kind of change isn't lasting. Poor Tomoko will be back to her regular behavior in a week, with no permanent improvement.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of trying to make things look magically better, why not just give her small victories throughout? That's how real progress is made. It comes not from willing your situation away, but slowly learning to deal with it. Show her continuing to reach out to people in her own minute, faltering ways. Then, even if she fails, help build that gradual change in her perception that she is learning to deal with rejection and failure, so it isn't as crushing. At the very least, have her experience empathy towards others, and learn to focus less on her internal, selfish problems, and more on being able to sympathize with others.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just ranting now. All in all, it is refreshing to see this sort of main character. I mean, how often do you see a female nerd as the main protagonist? Practically never. And despite my gripes, the show was fun to watch, even if it occasionally made my stomach turn. However, I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone who isn't hard core otaku. If you aren't some sort of social misfit, it might be hard to find common ground with Tomoko, and would make her very hard to relate to. Which funny enough, is pretty much her struggle within the show. Watamote is a strange little piece, and most people will probably just want to ignore it. But whether you acknowledge it or not, it's still there, waiting for someone to notice.",

I'll just start by answering my own question and basically explain to you the things you will say while watching this:\r\n    \" Man, I'm so grateful for my life.\"\r\n    \"Sadly, I can relate.\"\r\n    \"I have so much second hand embarrassment for her...\"\r\n    \" NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO,DON\"T DO IT, GAHHH, I CAN'T WATCH HER MESS HER LIFE UP!!\"\r\n    \"Tomoko, that's not how life works...*facepalm*.\"\r\nSo that's pretty much all your feels in anutshell....\\n\\n\r\n--Story-- 8/10\\n\r\nCreated by Nico Tanigawa and watched by several idiots, Watamote is about an anti-social 15 year old girl who's always wanted to be popular. In addition, she is somewhat an otaku and very pessimistic yet she thinks very highly of herself. Throughout the series, you get to watch Tomoko's struggle to becoming popular. The anime is episodic so you see something new and weird in every episode, even some ecchi scenes are included in Watamote (how's that for advertising). In most situations, she's the girl anime version of Bad Luck Brian, which, in that aspect, really makes the show hilarious. Watamote is an anime where, whether you like it or not really just depends on your type of humor. However, this brings me back to the \"watched by several idiots\" part. If you're a person who is \"innocent\" per say, Watamote  isn't for you. I've seen many people saying \" This is so inappropriate, it advertises how girls should feel in a wrong way!\" I have to disagree with that, now, I understand that some scenes maybe offensive however, it's supposed to be for comedy and it's anime, what do you expect?  Not only that, but you learn a lesson from all of the protagonist's faults and if you don't catch the moral of the episode then boiiii, you best be gettin dat education. \\n\\n\r\n--Art-- 7/10  \\n\r\nThe art style was average. Most of the characters looked like any other typical anime characters and had the same body shape and appearance. The backgrounds weren't anything great, though, they were realistic, but, again, typical. On the upside, the productions did very well depicting the animation to match the look and feels of characters and situations. They also made some scenes quite distinctive from any other comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound-- 9/10\\n\r\nThe OST is splendid. Both the opening and ending are very unique for an anime like Watamote. The background music does a great job at setting the mood for a situation as well. Sometimes, the sound is very happy go lucky at first then it would languish, depending on the situation. The seiyuu's also did a fantastic job at voice acting, Tomoko's voice couldn't have been any better. Overall, the sound is one of the most memorable parts of Watamote and definitely humorous.\\n\\n\r\n--Character-- 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Watamote were quite flat. Tomoko is the only actual character the other characters that show up consistently are her brother, Tomoki and her friend, Yuu-chan. The rest of the cast are insignificant and only show up in one episode. With Tomoko's iilogical thinking and werid predicaments. It's nice to have someone like her brother to keep the viewers sane.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment-- 9/10\\n\r\n Despite the flaws, Watamote was definitely enjoyable. I anticipated every episode and every episode kept me intrigued. Whether its's the humor, music, Tomoko, the illogically thinking or even the offensive scenes, this anime is memorable. Watamote is an anime that I will re-watch when I'm feelin down in the dumps, just to get a good laugh.   \\n\\n\r\n--Overall-- 8/10 \\n\r\nThe anime overall was average, however, due to the unique and comedic elements, I rate Watamote with a 8/10. I recommend this to people who are looking for something relatable or amusing. Until next time, goodbye my fellow organisms.\\n\\n\r\n P.S. This is my second review so feedback is much appreciated ^_^",

            "content": "Considering the anime I watched so far, there are 2 types of 'Slice of Life' anime: regular, and Watamote. Watching characters living their lives is one thing. But another thing is watching only one character TRYING to live her life.\r\nAnd what a life it is. Kuroki Tomoko, antisocial otaku striving to become popular in her new school. We watch her as she struggles to interact with people in situations like\u2026 saying \u201cHello!\u201d and \u201cGoodbye!\u201d. But there are also things she shines at - playing video games and watching anime...\r\nThat\u2019s the part of her, I kinda liked. I must confess,  I\u2019m a shut-in myself. Ofcourse, unlike her, I do have friends\u2026 I swear! Anyway, she tries her best to meet someone in new class. But I believe, one thing she\u2019s got wrong, is that she waits for others to make the first move. Her contribution is minimal.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it\u2019s different from other \u2018Slice of life\u2019 anime, where social interactions are the basics I guess. Who would watch anime where protagonist is awkward and can\u2019t talk properly to other people? Well, look at the number of fans of Watamote, and you get the answer. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for everyone. As we can read from discussions and reviews, it\u2019s a show, that\u2019s sometimes hard to watch. For me, especially when the second half started, watching the show was really painful, and made me realize how weird I may look to other people.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko IS weird. And sometimes\u2026 unappealing. When I started watching, I thought \u201cOh, she\u2019s just quiet and kinda kawaii girl\u201d. But then, near the end I realized\u2026 that\u2019s not the case, and the way she acts\u2026 just how can she be the protagonist? There are A LOT of embarrassing moments waiting for her. I often empathized with her, whenever something like that happened to her and whenever she reflected on the worst moments of her life.\\n\\n\r\nWe follow her for one year of the new school listening to her narration. That gives us great contrast between what she does and what she intends to do. Also, probably that\u2019s why there are so many references to other poplar anime. Hearing her thoughts not always justifies her actions. Although she tries to be popular, she clearly doesn\u2019t want that or really lacks the skills to do so. It\u2019s hard to change one\u2019s way of behaving, I know something about that.\\n\\n\r\nPlease skip this paragraph if you don\u2019t want the ending spoiled. [SPOILER ALERT]. Ending might not be satisfying for some. We have Tomoko in situation, that could greatly improve her status. Yet, she\u2026 panics (running scene is epic by the way). There she goes, back home to her loneliness. So what now? Was it all in vain? I believe her last words will eventually cause her to pay less attention to what people think about her, and that will lead to making some friends and having less pressure. Yay, happy headcannon! [SPOILERS END]\\n\\n\r\nIn short, I highly recommend watching the anime. Not everyone may like it, but I sure did. It\u2019s great in its own way, and gives a chance to experience something new and different from what other anime have to offer.",

            "content": "Perhaps, one of the worst anime series this season has to offer. It fails horribly at every aspect: Story, Art, Sound, and etc\r\nIt pretends to be some serious social problem, but in reality its otkau pandering. Some Loli wants to be social and likeable. Tries to do various stuff to achieve that only to fail every single time. It may be funny for a couple of episodes, and any basement dweller out there is definitely going to identify with the problem the Loli facing. Other than that there is no plot, there is no development, and it becomes a pain to watch knowing there\u2019s zerochance for development at the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 1\\n\r\nThe story is basically non-existent and follows the same repetitious pattern every single episode. After the third episode this pattern starts to get tiresome when you notice there\u2019s no actual character development it becomes a chore to watch. Please don\u2019t give me this B.S., that Slice of Life animes don\u2019t need to have an actual story and can actually be repetitive. Many Slice of Life\u2019s aren\u2019t repetitive and don\u2019t follow a patterned storyline. For example Planetes, Welcome to the NHK, and Tatami Galaxy, story progresses. In addition the jokes are tiresome and idiotic; they pan to the lowest form of intelligence\\n\\n\r\nArt- 2\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 2\\n\r\nThe voice acting is just plain horrid. This isn\u2019t what a person that has social anxiety sounds like at all. Tomoko sounds like a dying whale. The crappy OST is, also horrible and doesn\u2019t fit the series well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 1\\n\r\nWhat characters are there? There\u2019s Tomoko, her brother and friend. These are the only characters, which I doubt you can even count them at all. This anime would actually be better if it included more characters in the dialogue, because Tomoko obviously cannot hold this anime together by herself. She also suffers from character development, never learning from her mistakes. She\u2019s the exact same person as she was in episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 1\\n\r\nThis anime absolutely sucked. It was filled with horrid retarded jokes. In addition it was filled with otaku pandering, so every otaku and anime fan relates to the numerous rpgs  and various anime Tomoko names.\\n",

            "content": "I have no idea how to open up this review to be honest. WataMote was one of the first animes I saw in 2014 as ridiculous at that might sound. So when I first saw it most of it references with the exception of Battle Royale and Dragon Ball Z flew over my head. What drew me in was the lead character and how I find her likable. Tomoko kept me coming back despite how embarrassing the situations she got herself into were. However, a whole year has past with me now into anime alongside having found a couple of titles that influenced my standardsfor certain genres. Seeing WataMote is similar to seeing a friend you haven\u2019t seen in a year; do you accept them despite never changing or you do ignore them and move on. Well aware of the consequences I still chose the former. \\n\\n\r\nMixed: A decent setup that refuses to move past the status quo\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is an episodic slice of life comedy anime series that focuses on the misadventures of Tomoko Kuroki in her quest to become popular in high school. Kinda small scale popularity, but it\u2019s what her heart\u2019s desires. The first episode does an excellent job establishing how much of a social outcast Tomoko is and her extreme social anxiety. Managing to be entertaining despite only focusing on a single character. Within its first episode it showed there some promise to be seen in the series if it develops beyond the initial premise. Unfortunately, once past the halfway mark any hopes of that will be thrown out of the window if it\u2019s not already. \\n\\n\r\nIts main brand of humor is referential humor or Tomoko reaction in a given situation. Unfortunately referential humor does makeup for large portions of it jokes. Some referential jokes will work even without getting the reference because of Tomoko over the top reaction in the situation, but the more direct and specific ones won\u2019t work unless you have some knowledge to what it\u2019s referencing. Simultaneously doing referential humor correctly and incorrectly. Tomoko never gives a normal reaction making a big deal out of everything. In episode 12, she imagines squashing a cockroach will lead to the entire class clapping and cheering her name out loud. Situation that Tomoko is put into changes from episode to episode. One episode will have her spending her whole summer in her room while another focuses on her attempting to get cuter by playing otome video games. The humor never evolves from how it starts out, but the variety in situations prevent it from getting as stale as it could have gotten. Another way it changes the humor up is by introducing a supporting character for Tomoko to interact with for a short length or an entire episode. Breaking the usual formula while staying in line with its specific brand of humor. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest pitfall of WataMote is it desire to return to the status quo by the end of every episode. What progress is made is unimportant in the long run like Tomoko impressing her cousin or seeing an old friend from middle school. This makes her endeavor come across as a lost cause and as a viewer makes it reluctant to want to stick around to the end. However, no matter the embarrassing situations Tomoko gets herself into, the anime isn\u2019t mean spirited. None of the characters mistreat her in any way. At most, Tomoki Kuroki (Tomoko\u2019s younger brother) acting like siblings is about as cruel as it gets. This is counteracted by the fact that everything that happens to her in the series is her fault. Now due to the status quo effect the fact nothing changes for Tomoko in any positive way might make it depressing. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending...it\u2019s something. How to classify it as is difficult. For starter, the narrator flat out tells the viewer that \u201cThis is a story about a peculiar girl. An unpopular girl, and it really doesn\u2019t matter\u201d at the end of the final episode. That line is equal to a middle finger to your face. The same final scene continues with Tomoko getting the final line that hints at some possible progression on her outlook on popularity. What you\u2019re ultimately left with is an ending where it\u2019s the only time narrative and character progress can be made cutting the story there instead of taking risks. Playing it safe with its comfortable doing, but also tells the viewer itself it doesn\u2019t matter if they see it. \\n\\n\r\nMixed: A great lead, but under utilize supporting cast\\n\\n\r\nWatamote only character worth paying attention too is it lead Tomoko Kuroki. She\u2019s a \u201cdown to Earth\u201d character whose social anxiety makes her easy to relate too. Receiving most of the characterization through her many monologues developing various aspect about her personality from what she likes, her hobbies, her past, her thought process, and anything you can imagine. Like mentioned before, the series ends without progression. For as much development she receives she is too a static character who doesn\u2019t learn nor changes. She is also a double edge sword; If you don\u2019t like Tomoko Kuroki then the anime will fail. This also effect the supporting cast since Tomoko is the sole focus in every single episode. If you hate her then it wrote itself into a corner by offering no other character to latch onto or explore. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast don\u2019t receive enough characterization to stand on their own. Their only purpose is to interact with Tomoko to break up its own formula. Tomoki Kuroki whenever on screen is usually disgusted or annoyed at the sight of his big sister. Much like Tomoko, whenever Tomoki is on screen the humor lies in how he react to Tomoko. There\u2019s no variation on how Tomoki is use within the story. Another supporting character is Yuu Naruse, a middle school friend of Tomoko who goes to a different high school. Tomoko interaction with Yuu are good times for Tomoko whenever she feeling down. It\u2019s breather to see Tomoko speak with another person semi-sucessfully who isn\u2019t her brother. \\n\\n\r\nThat about wraps up the semi-important supporting characters. Tomoki and Yuu are the only ones who receive partial screen time or play an important role in an episode in some way. Other supporting characters include Tomoko parents who don\u2019t have many moments of good parenting. Ki is Tomoko cousin who appears in one episode than is never heard off again. There\u2019s also certain students in Tomoko classes that are often shown, but don\u2019t come into the picture aside from being criticize by Tomoko. Among them is a student council president who goes out of her way to cheer Tomoko up. Sadly, the series ends before it could anything with that development.\\n\\n\r\nGood: A solid direction holds a small budget together\\n\\n\r\nWataMote animation is done by Silver Link favoring flashiness over consistency for this anime. The animation isn\u2019t stellar in any area, but works nonetheless. It simply looks fine with some questionable choices that fall under artistic and laziness. The opening animation is artistic showing Tomoko wanting to break free from her chains of unpopularity while the ending animation shows how she actually deals with it. Laziness comes in the form of background characters in several episodes being animated without any eyes drawn on. Some choices are questionable in execution. Episode 4 opens with Tomoko surfing on a website. Within the first couple of seconds there\u2019s a promo displaying on the site that Tomoko is on promoting the anime adaptation of WataMote. If the character in the promo was design differently it would be a decent visual gag that broke the fourth wall, but instead what it does is break immersion. If a character that looks exactly like our lead is used in promos it begs the question why she isn\u2019t considered popular in within the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are simplistic reusing the limited locations alongside with Tomoko having the only notable character design. Lighting in many scenes are done with multiple hexagons or large circles inside smaller same shapes. In order to color in different shading, though even if the scene takes place at night time everything still looks bright. Some of the animation shortcoming is made up by incorporating different art styles whenever Tomoko goes on one of her rants or fantasy the animation style changes so suit her emotion. Often time nailing the exact look and style of what it\u2019s referencing in that scene. Another positive is the animation nailed Tomoko expressions being hysterical when a joke works or when there\u2019s a cringeworthy moment on screen. \\n\\n\r\nIzumi Kitta excels in the lead role of Tomoko Kuroki in the Japanese cast. She\u2019s fully committed to the role on all account. Delivering a natural performance as a dysfunctional high school girl while making her likable. Kitta is never too showy whenever delivering her more outrageous monologues and never over sells it during the more tender moments. Perfectly balancing the various bottled up emotion of Tomoko. The fact that Izumi Kitta was able to make a character who sometimes blames her social anxiety on other people sympathetic is a huge praise for how well she did in the role. \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is done by Sentai Filmworks and the only casting choice they needed to get absolutely right was Tomoko Kuroki. Monica Rail is a talented actress, but unfortunately her performance lacks the finesse that Izumi Kitta brought to the same character. Monica Rail sounds force exaggerating her dialogue no matter if the context demanded it or not. Creating a character who instead of being socially awkward turns into a person who doesn\u2019t know how to act human. Another downside to Monica Rail in the lead role is she does not sing in the English dub of the anime. The closing themes for a majority of the episodes has Tomoko singing the ending theme. Hearing the same character go from speaking awkwardly in English, then singing in Japanese in a charming way in several episodes is distracting. Overall, it\u2019s not entirely a bad performance. Monica Rail has a good sense of comedic timing in her delivery. While Izumi Kitta is the better Tomoko all around Monica Rail attempt at the role is decent occasionally delivering a good laugh. If anything, it\u2019s worth checking out at least once to listen to Monica Rail says thing like \u201cI need to turn myself into a high school slut\u201d that goes against the clean image of some other characters she voices. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue changes in the English dub are minor in general. Some phrases received changes so it could be more digestible for Western audiences. For example, Tomoko says in episode 5 \u201cI\u2019ll probably find something lewd in his room\u201d in the English sub while in the English dub it was translated too \u201cI\u2019ll probablly find some porno in his room\u201d. Dialogue changes like these don\u2019t affect anything important. The English wording for some comedic lines loses their comedic touch upon delivering in writing and performance. In episode three, there\u2019s a scene where Tomoko says \u201cI-I figured I would go take a really messy shit in the bathroom or something\u201d when talking to two guys in the rain. When Izumi Kitta delivers the line it\u2019s comical as well as cringeworthy. When Monica Rail says \u201cI-I just got to take a dump outside that restroom\u201d it\u2019s just comes off awkward. Several scenes can lose a semblance of comedy making you question if it\u2019s a comedy at all. Finally, Sentai Filmworks felt the need to include subtitles to explain references in the English dub. Don\u2019t know why they felt the need to do that since it won\u2019t change if the joke itself is funny or not in execution. In both, the supporting cast get minimal usage. It\u2019s because of this both supporting cast comes off as being equal in the voice acting department. Good performances for the limited time they receive, but not enough to make them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you had to choose between the sub or English dub without a doubt go for the sub. Even if the comedic lines were directly translated in the English dub Izumi Kitta simply embodies the leading role far better than Monica Rail. Izumi Kitta sounds natural whereas Monica Rail is more in line of an embarrassing grandmother speaking like a teen in an effort to be hip. Also, the small fact hearing Izumi Kitta sing the closing theme gives Tomoko more charm when she optimistically sings about her social life to improve. Monical Rail doesn\u2019t even sing when playing Tomoko which is immediately distracting in the English seeing a character speaking English singing in another language she doesn\u2019t speak in within the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is done by a group called Sadesper Record. Made up of composers Goro Watari (also goes by NARASAKI) and Masaki Oshima (also know as WATCHMAN) both of whom provide an OST comprised of electronic, comical, orchestrated, and hard rock music. The OST works fine in the anime series being diverse as it needs to be to complement the loner slice of life moments to the over exaggeration of Tomoko fantasies. It\u2019s pleasant to listen too, but fail in comparison to the opening and closing themes of the series which are memorable without the company of the anime visuals. The opening theme is a hard rock song called \u201cWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui\" sung by Konomi Suzuki and Kiba of Akiba. It\u2019s a hard rock song that fits with the anime capturing Tomoko bottle up emotion to break free.\\n\\n\r\nWatamote despite being a twelve episode long anime has five different ending themes. The most use track for the ending is \"Dou Kangaete mo Watashi wa Warukunai\" by Izumi Kitta in episodes 1, 3, 4, 7 - 10, and 12. It\u2019s an upbeat pop song that\u2019s fun to listen to everytime. \u201cMusou Renka\u201d by Velvet.kodhy is used in episode 2 and it\u2019s forgettable. It\u2019s a alternative rock song with mixture of rap and hip hop splice together speeding up and slowing down it\u2019s instrumental. Vocals that need work hitting high note and actual emotion because the singing sounds phoned in. Ironically, \u201cYoru no Tobari yo Sayonara\u201d also by Velvet.kodhy in episode 5 has none of those problems. It\u2019s a silly song with the vocalist singing in a deep voice and its done well. Going perfectly with the closing animation referencing the ending animation of Manga Nihon Musashi Banashi. Though, these two tracks aren\u2019t memorable without the company of the anime visuals. \u201cSokora no Nuigurumi no Fuusen to Watashi\u201d by Velvet.kodhy and Velvet.kodhy and \u03bc and \u03bc is another pleasant track used in episode 11. It has a feel good aura about it. From it two vocalist sharing a good time singing together and it\u2019s joyous instrumentals. \u201cNatsu Matsuri\u201d by Utsu-P & Minatsukitoka ft. Hatsune Miku is used in episode 6. Combining foreboding piano music before going into techno sound bytes, with hard rock guitar strings, and robotic sounding autotune singing. This track is the closest the anime gets to matching the rock opening. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Enjoyable, but with apparent flaws\\n\\n\r\nI did find the English dub inferior because Monica Rail wasn\u2019t quite on par with voice actress Izumi Kitta. However, I did get a kick listening to Monica Rail say things I never expected to hear from her. That made the dub worth seeing even if the performance wasn\u2019t quite to the level I wanted it to be at. Having seen this anime again in English I was able to catch more references than I was before. Not of all of them were subtle like a reference to Battle Royale and anything specifically named is hard to missed. The references I caught having seen WataMote again were Death Note, Tomoki Kuroki reading volume 8 of Arachnid in episode one, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Attack on Titan. Unfortunately, WataMote wasn\u2019t quite as good as I remembered when I first saw it and boils down to nothing happens nor changes. It\u2019s a static series were the potential is there to grow beyond the initial idea, but doesn\u2019t know how to go about doing it. I still like the anime and find Tomoko Kuroki an endearing awkward character, but when the anime itself says it\u2019s unimportant it epitomizes the down side for some slice of life animes. Good for the moment, but nothing that\u2019ll remain with you forever.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is a fun series to see no how awkward the situations got for Tomoko. It\u2019s not a mean spirited anime since the main character is never mistreated by others, but has the potential to get depressing when realizing it\u2019s her own fault for not improving herself. What it does provide is a lead character whose easily relatable among those with social anxiety, some killer tunes that either make you want to rock out too or cheer you up, and a stellar performance by Izumi Kitta. This anime floats or sink on the appeal of it\u2019s lead in a static environment. If even after reading this entire review you still don\u2019t know to check out the anime ask yourself if you want a dynamic or static story from this premise? If you choose the former go onto something else, but if you choose the latter enjoy sharing the same awkward experiences as Tomoko that few slice of life animes will touch upon.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nGrowing up as a kid entails many different aspects. How many friends do I have? What is the next event to go to? Does the girl from my math class have an interest in me? In short, many teenagers worry about their \"popularity.\" Because being popular nets you more of everything that high school life has to offer. Watamote is such a story of obtaining this ever-wanted goal, but with a rather unorthodox spin.\r\nSTORY\r\nWatamote features Tomoko, a young girl just starting her high school life. Not wanting to stick to the past, she decides she will take measuresto eventually become as popular as she aims to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt becomes rather apparent rather quickly that such a feat for her is nigh impossible. Without a doubt, this is by far the most cringe-inducing show I have ever seen. Every episode is filled with moments that depict Tomoko attempting to increase her status in the social hierarchy, but with the result always ending in failure. This is not a joke. Every single time she is raised up, even slightly, she is immediately beaten back down past where she started. In this regard, the show actually does a surprisingly good job of varying up the many different situations that Tomoko finds herself in. And because of this, you are constantly feeling extremely awkward with what is going on, in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nNow, something that the show aims to do is to showcase or at least demonstrate this type of person. There are people out there like this, who cannot express their feelings, talk with other people easily, or who are constantly trying to make their lives better. Are they all as far left as Tomoko is? Certainly not; she is the epitome of what it means to be a recluse. But this is a start. While you may not believe that everyday people are struggling with similar issues as her, Watamote wants you to realize that these people do exist, who do have incredible difficulty when it comes to making the \"correct\" choices in every day life.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the interesting things that the show brings to light is both the way in which it begins and the way in which it ends. That is, essentially what happens doesn't matter. You might be asking yourself, \"Doesn't this contradict what you said before?\" Actually, no. Because this is the right side of the spectrum; after all of the embarrassing-beyond-words events that she goes through, it's also important to remember that sometimes you have to just accept the past for what it is, and just better yourself. Everyone makes mistakes (some more then others), and sometimes just learning to move on is the best course of action.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Watamote is both generic and unique. It has the rather plain-Jane friend and the typical younger brother for character designs. But it's Tomoko's design that garners the most attention. This is simply because she always has this disheveled, worn look about her throughout the vast majority of the show. Instead of depicting a cute, quirky \"nerd,\" they capture the essence of a shut-in well. With her crow's feet, dark circles, messy black hair, pale skin, small demeanor, and average looks, she's actually not attractive at all. And that's the point.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing of note in terms of art was the decision to usually use a technique in which Tomoko's outward appearance wasn't matching her inner thoughts. The show would flip between dull, boring grays to harsh, vibrant reds, greens, and purples to achieve a nice dichotomy between her gloomy and loud personalities. It was executed nicely because again it really demonstrated who Tomoko was.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the animation isn't as stellar. To be honest, it isn't anything more than average. Not a lot happens within the show, since it's mostly dialogue or inner-monologue by Tomoko, but even for the things that are going on, there isn't much movement. This is true for Tomoko herself, the rest of the cast, and the environment as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWriting a thesis on Tomoko alone should be possible, but I'll stick to a shorter version. In short, she is the only character within the show, which is something that I haven't really experienced. There are almost always supporting characters to back the main ones up, but in the grand scheme of things, they don't matter in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Tomoko. I'll split her characterization into four different parts that I feel are the most significant: her self-denial, her determination to become something more, her ironically wanting to be what she hates, and how she doesn't develop overall. It's a lot to cover, but bear with me.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, her self-denial. This is something that plagues her throughout the entire show, and is the underlying cause for why she experiences such cringe-y situations. When she concocts her plans and goes about them, the result she gets is never looked at. Instead of capitalizing on what she did right or wrong, she just moves on to the next idea. Thus, perpetuating the self-denial she has every time.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, is her determination. Oddly enough, despite her social awkwardness, she tries her hardest at everything she does. It's one of her greatest qualities that goes unnoticed by everyone (including perhaps herself). It's this part of her that the viewer likes. I want her to succeed at talking to the boy at the library, I want to see her having fun with her friend at the cultural festival. And it saddens me when I see all of her effort go to waste because what she chose to do in the end just wasn't right.\\n\\n\r\nOn the opposite side, her ultimate goal actually is to be the very thing she hates, a \"bitch.\" Being immensely popular, having tons of friends, and nailing a boyfriend are her dreams. And yet, every chance she gets, she bashes these very people for their, what she calls, idiotic ideas. This side of her you hate, in a well done way. Her \"true self\" is rude, crazy, and somewhat evil. This side of her makes me not want to see her succeed, because she almost doesn't deserve it for how much she puts it down.\\n\\n\r\nMy last point on Tomoko is that her only issue is that she never develops as a character. Now, this is probably an entire point of the show; that she really isn't supposed to. But I would have liked to have seen some type of realization, whether that be with her self-denial, her determination, or her self-conscious, rather than her never making progress one way or the other.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is pretty sick. Metal, harsh, and filled with great guitar and drum solos, it is oddly fitting for the show. It matches Tomoko's desire to \"break free\" from the chains that are holding her back. I loved it a lot, but rock 'n' roll/metal music is a personal favorite of mine, so I'm slightly biased here.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is amazing not because it has good music or good lyrics, but because of Tomoko. Once again, it is oddly fitting because it incorporates her super awkward behavior throughout it. You would never listen to this song on its own, because it only works within the context of the show, and it works very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Watamote is also very good. It contains metal guitar riffs, choir singing, and other strange instrument/vocal combinations that fit the mood and the situations perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, I want to say that Izumi Kitta's voice acting performance as Tomoko deserves the highest of praise from everyone. The range she covered was large, but it did not faze her. It is one of the best VA performances I have had the pleasure of hearing (right up there with Okabe from Steins;Gate), and she deserves every accolade because of it. Seriously, she did a beyond exceptional job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI think many people look at the show, start watching it, and really only rate it based on how \"dumb\" it is. \"Dumb\" in this case meaning how incredibly cringe-inducing, awkward, and embarrassing it always is. Meaning, if people like those types of scenarios, they love the show, and vice versa. But this anime is more than that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's funny when it needs to be, it's insightful when it tries, and it makes you see things that are almost never talked about. The cringe part of the show is definitely its strongest point (outside of Tomoko), but only judging the show based on that isn't fair.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the transitions that the show used, the censoring it incorporated, Tomoko's super quiet and stuttering public talking, and all of her silly plans that just never went her way. It's not a show that I adored, but I liked what it had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you can endure the cringe, Watamote deserves more credit than it gets. While Tomoko may have been unsuccessful in her endeavors to become supremely popular, if I could tell her one thing, it would be that that she has at least one fan in the books.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, cringe-galore gives an interesting outlook\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, stale animation but cool art style and direction\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Tomoko, like her, is just shy of being one of the greats\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, sick OP, unique ED, nice soundtrack, outstanding VA performance by Izumi Kitta\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, this one is more than meets the eye\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Watamote gained extensive popularity very quickly around the internet for its \"relatable\" stories of geekdom and social awkwardness. Because of this, I was prompted to watch the series to see if I would enjoy it as much as it's been glorified. As I watched it, I didn't feel humored at all. Watamote's reputation covered up its many flaws as an anime. \r\nStory: 4/10\r\n The plot of Watamote follows Kuroki Tomoko as she enters high school, expecting to be wildly popular among the boys. Of course, this turns out to be far from the truth as she is completely introverted. The show simply proceeds to showTomoko's sad attempts at becoming a more social person. In order to stay true to the manga, there is no development in the storyline. It's merely a series of Tomoko's failures in the real world. Now, this should be hilarious and relatable, but I ended up feeling absolutely pitiful by the end of it. No one should be that introverted and lonely. While there probably is some out there that can connect to her, I barely could. Some moments of the show I laughed at Tomoko's poor decisions, but most of the time I felt uncomfortable. It ended up leaving a negative impression on me. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the factors of the show that greatly appealed to me. The animators didn't skimp out and their price was nicely paid. Watamote's art is filled with ambience and bright colors. The character and setting designs are lovely to look at, even though most of the background characters were just gray bodies. The animation was high quality and nicely done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe sounds of Watamote are above average. Some fields of it were definitely great while others felt bland to me. The voice actress for Tomoko did a fantastic job of conveying her personality. It really sounded like an introverted teenage girl, especially during scenes where Tomoko had to interact with other people. The opening sequence is pretty... unique compared to other opening songs and I usually skip it, save for one episode where the transition from anime to opening song was AMAZING. The ending sequence is sung by Tomoko's voice actress and pretty cute, but not good enough for me to get hooked on. Songs and voices together, Watamore has an above average sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile the plot for Watamote was pretty stagnant, I gotta say, the characters are pretty interesting. Tomoko has a lot of personality as a person. Even though she's still socially awkward and strange, she brings a lot of humor to the show. Her wild ideas and fantasies end up creating the craziest situations. It's a deal breaker that she gets absolutely no development, but she's filled with great interest as a main character. A couple of the side characters were fun as well, especially Tomoko's non-empathetic younger brother, Tomoki, who has to sit through hearing about Tomoko's sad life. Despite the zero-development, the characters are somewhat enjoyable, but not enough to be lovable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nAt first, Watamote was interesting, but as the episodes went on, my feelings for the show went from interested to pitiful. I couldn't help but feel extremely uncomfortable while watching Tomoko fantasizing about being popular while being totally introverted. At the end of each episode, I felt sorry for her instead of feeling entertained. I could not enjoy it all after the second half. Watamote should have been filled with dark humor, but ended up filling me with uncomfort. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 \\n\r\nWatamote honestly could have been really good. The manga is hilarious, but the adaptation was not. While the characters and animation are great, the upsetting blatant storyline and \"humor\" keep me from liking it as much as other people do.",

            "content": "\u201cReally Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time\u201d \u2015 Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (book)\r\nHigh school can be tough. It is, no one denies that fact. As the years go on and one gets closer to senior year, the number of assignments and homework starts to pile up. Some may dismiss all of this and just live wildly. Others might not (like me)  and do in fact do their homework like a good boy or girl (Santa gave me presents last year because of that).High school is not a popularity contest, popularity was something that you thought was super important in middle school, but gradually lost importance as the years rolled by. You enter high school with your group of friends that you made in middle school and everything is nice and dandy, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, maybe not for everybody. And certainly not for Tomoko Kuroki, our main protagonist. Watashi ga Motenai no wa d\u014d Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (No Matter How I Look at It, It\u2019s You Guys' Fault I\u2019m Not Popular!), or WataMote for short, is your not so generic slice-of-life anime featuring our main female protagonist Tomoko Kuroki as she struggles with her high school life. But, as with most high school animes, she doesn't struggle with class since teachers in Japan are mythical creatures, but instead with her underwhelming popularity and her overwhelming desire to increase her nonexistent popularity. Sounds simple right? \\n\\n\r\nA socially awkward person since a young age, Tomoko seeks to rectify her lack of friends upon entering high school. She has spent countless hours playing otome games in order to learn the mystical and sublime art of talking to men. However, two months into high school and Tomoko is as lonely as ever. Without a clue as to what is failing due to her belief that high school makes her instantly popular, Tomoko, who by the way has a very positive image about the way she looks (meaning to say that she thinks she's a total hottie), takes a good long look at the mirror for the first time in who knows how many years, only to find the exact same opposite of what she thought of herself. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where WataMote kicks off and generally what drives the series through twelve very painful to watch episodes as Tomoko tries her best at becoming popular. Why is it painful, you ask? Let me give you what I believe to be the most cringe worthy moment of the entire anime. After entering a crowded train, Tomoko feels something rubbing up against her. She starts feeling nervous and scared, believing it is a molester. The thing rubbing her then goes farther down, and Tomoko starts fearing for her life. As the train arrives to its next stop, Tomoko goes out running, only to be stuck by this thing rubbing against her and unable to move with dozens of people watching. We then hear a voice of a young girl apologizing that her naginata equipment got stuck on Tomoko. After experiencing a tremendous amount of public embarrassment, Tomoko breaks free and goes on with her life as usual. \\n\\n\r\nWataMote carries a comedy tag to it, but to say that this show is comedy would be kind of an insult. I actually felt sorry for her on many occasions, like on episode three when her umbrella breaks and she gets stuck taking shelter with two boys. After making a run for the bathroom, she return to the shelter only to find the boys gone and decides to take a nap to wait out the rain. When she wakes up (still raining), she finds a new umbrella beside her and goes on home, silently wishing  that , for once, a boy would do something nice for her, all the while not noticing that it was these same two boys who bought that umbrella for her. It's really disheartening and it pains me to watch at times because of scenes like this one.\\n\\n\r\nGetting back to the topic at hand, WataMote has in total twelve episodes. The story is episodic in nature with the over arching story being, as said above, Tomoko's resolve to become popular. It's a story about character development and you really want to see her get some friends, but at the end of the day you realize that the character development is almost nonexistent. WataMote just doesn't end, it basically tells you to deal with it or just go and read the manga. I know its twelve episodes long, but a little closure for our main character would have been much appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, there's a few that caught my attention. First off is, of course, Tomoko. A fifteen year old recluse that borders into being a deranged person, craving for acceptance. With heavy bags under her eyes, she is supposed to symbolize many shut ins that exist nowadays. I've already said enough about her for you to have a clear picture of her, so let's just move on.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki is Tomoko's younger brother. A talented soccer player, Tomoki is what Tomoko isn't: popular. He often questions Tomoko's sanity and weird behavior and is often annoyed by her personality. Tomoko usually goes to him for advice on how to talk to men seeing as he is the only male character in the series she can talk to normally.\\n\\n\r\nYu Naruse is Tomoko's best friend from middle school. No wait, she's her only friend from middle school. She first appears in episode two having invited Tomoko to hang out, given that she went to a different high school than Tomoko. A recluse at heart, Yu actually managed to garner popularity by changing her appearance, ranging from dying her hair to breast implants. Tomoko is at first afraid that she isn't the same Yu from middle school, but soon finds out that she still enjoys everything that she did in middle school, such as watching anime, reading manga and playing video games. As such, she like Tomoki is what Tomoko isn't: popular.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic for animation nothing to say here really. Its good, but nothing that stands out. The studio that worked on WataMote is studio Silver Link, known for their work in Kokoro Connect. The director for WataMote is none other than Shin Oonuma, known for his role as director in shows such as ef: A Tale of Melodies/Memories and Kokoro Connect. Bottom line, it gets the job done, but its nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the soundtrack for WataMote was nothing amazing. It just sounds like any other slice of life anime out there and none of the tracks stand out except for the opening. Watashi ga Motenai no wa d\u014d Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! by Konomi Suzuki and Kiba of Akiba is the opening that spans across all twelve episodes of the series. This opening is, in my most humble opinion, a true masterpiece. A song filled with heavy metal and angry vocals accompanied by dark grim images of Tomoko in chains symbolizes just how angry and lonely Tomoko is in correlation with the rest of the world. It really shows the main underlying theme of the show which is Tomoko wanting to break free of her social anxiety. Beautiful to watch, one of my favorite openings of all time just because of its connection with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe series sports various endings indeed. The main ending theme, D\u014d Kangaetemo Watashi wa Warukunai, is featured in all but four episodes.  Episodes two and five use Mus\u014d Renka and  Yoru no Tobari yo Say\u014dnara respectively, both performed by Velvet,Kodhy. Episode six uses Natsu Matsuri by Utsu-P & Toka Minatsuki, featuring vocals by Hatsune Miku (yay) while  episode eleven utilizes Sokora no Chaku-Gurumi no F\u016bsen to Watashi by Velvet,Kodhy.\\n\\n\r\nThis review has gone long enough so let's wrap it up. I initially started watching WataMote because, from an outsiders perspective, Tomoko looks a bit like a friend of mine. I wanted to watch the show and then show her how Tomoko and her looked alike. But after watching a few episodes, I knew Tomoko and my friend were nothing alike. I honestly cannot comprehend the purpose of this show. Is it a parody on recluse and otakus or just a very mean black comedy show? I don't know and I prefer to leave it that way because it adds a certain charm to it. Speaking of charm, this show contains some scenes that parody other famous animes like Death Note and Ghost in the Shell. See if you can find them all!\\n\\n\r\nWith all that in mind, it is time for my final verdict. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I enjoyed WataMote or not. It certainly was disturbing, painful, and sad to watch. Animation is good, but nothing spectacular. The music is meh with the exception of the opening and the character development is, well... meh as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Watashi ga Motenai no wa d\u014d Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! a final score of 6.2 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my second review here on MAL, so any feedback, as usual, would be very welcome. Have a great day, and you can be on the lookout for my next review. \\n",

            "content": "The opening is fascinating to watch (even if the 'music' is terrible), the closing also good and a bit catchy. Izumi Kitta delivers an excellent performance, ranging from low sarcasm to deep despair to girly glee. The many faces of Kuroki and the animation mean that despite being almost a 12-episode long monologue, we don't get bored watching. That aside.\r\n_Watamote_ is one of the most painful anime I have ever watched, up there with _End of Evangelion_. I was expecting something not so much in the vein of the lighthearted _Genshiken_ or _Tatami Galaxy_, but the fairly dark _Welcome to the N.H.K.!_ and I gotthat, in spades, without the slightest hope of redemption, turned up to the max.\\n\\n\r\nAnxiety about social interactions is common. And it's amusing - lots of great gags are based on misunderstandings, overthinking things, worries which turn out to be groundless, and revelations of things better kept secret. _Watamote_ has all that, in every episode. And it has plenty of irony: I particularly enjoyed, when I was still watching episode 1 and didn't realize what I was in for, Kuroki's bookstore line  \"The people here are all way worse than me. Feels good to be here.\" Yeah, that really sums up a lot of nerds' feelings sometimes at safe places like conventions, doesn't it? It's amusing for being ironic on Kuroki as it's immediately subverted, but the viewer probably can recognize that the line and irony apply to themselves a little bit as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is... it all goes too far. Not too long ago, I was corresponding with what I now suspect to have been a mentally ill person, and I deliberately mocked their claims and led them on to see what they'd say (http://www.gwern.net/Blackmail); it occurred to me partway that they might be mentally ill, but I dismissed it as my usual arrogance, until a vaguely increasing sense of unease and sense of guilt led me to tone things down. In retrospect, I did not handle the incident too well. I began to feel the same way in episode 3: that I was enjoying myself at the expense of someone who I should not be enjoying myself at the expense of, that I was being shown the humiliation and mockery of someone deeply disabled and mentally ill. In fact, look up the DSM-5's criteria for 'social anxiety disorder': A-G match perfectly except *perhaps* C (\"The person recognizes that this fear is unreasonable or excessive.\"). You wouldn't watch a film about mocking the blind, or the deaf, or playing pranks on paraplegics, or about tying cans to a cat's tail; you wouldn't enjoy an anime focused on the wacky doings of a mentally retarded person - *you'd feel bad about yourself*. I feel bad about watching _Watamote_. Kimochi warui, dudes. I felt mental pain watching many episodes. I had to pause scenes, or just stop episodes for that day, or play them on 2x to force my way through the chagrin and embarrassment. \\n\\n\r\nKuroki is, besides a sick character who you want to see get treatment, not a nice person, to put it mildly. She has a serious sadistic streak, massively projects negative traits, is self-centered and entitled, abusive of others, and resents the slightest justified demand on her. It's not pleasant watching her, at all. A character without redeeming aspects is a hard sell as a protagonist, and I'd probably appreciate such a non-moe female character if I could get over everything else. But actually, it's probably better for the viewer's peace of mind to not sympathasize with Kuroki (although it's hard given that we spend the entire series inside her head, and we all remember similar embarrassing experiences as those Kuroki endures, even if ours were much tamer).\\n\\n\r\nWorse are the people around her. It seems initially cute when her mother walks in on her doing something extremely awkward and pretends it doesn't exist, or when her father finds her asleep having apparently masturbated and just calmly puts her to bed. It gets a lot less cute when you begin to notice that Kuroki's social anxiety is pathological, longstanding, and notice that almost the only time Kuroki's mother disciplines her is when Kuroki threatens her image when her sister is coming over with Kuroki's cousin, and when she needs some work done. My mental image of the mother as tolerating Kuroki's phase and giving her space to work out her issues without pressuring her suddenly flips into a different concern: Japanese society is, I am told, not very good at dealing with mental illness and puts a stigma and taboo on acknowledging any issues or seeking treatment. _Watamote_ is generally a very realistic show (eg all the references I noticed were to real stuff: a ton of _Haruhi_ references, _Detective Conan_, _Another_, _K-On!_, Nico Nico Douga, _Nadia_, McDonald's, etc), including no fantastical materials, minimal coincidences, an unattractive protagonist who isn't Hollywood Homely (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely)...  What ever shows that Kuroki's parents care much about her at all, and aren't just protecting their social image and reputation and doing their best to pretend Kuroki has no problems? For that matter, what about her classmates? The show seems to go out of its way to depict all her classmates as good nice people who even are bothered by killing a cockroach, and certainly are not bullying or mistreating Kuroki... yet, she never speaks to anyone. Isn't that going a little beyond their description \"Kuroki-san is quiet\"? Quiet, certainly, but never talking to anyone, never eating lunch with anyone, never participating in anything... It's not like they don't have plenty of opportunity to notice. The council president starts to suspect the problem after just 2 or 3 brief encounters with Kuroki, and her cousin strongly suspects after a day or two. The class could know if it wants to. We might initially place our hope in the teachers, since the homeroom teacher interacts a little bit with Kuroki early on, but it never goes beyond that. Why only ever tell her to be careful on the way home? You can try talking about more than that! And her best friend Yuu? Completely oblivious. (Or is she? Given that she seems to be consciously playing a role, one wonders.)\\n\\n\r\nSo. The parents are apparently trying to cover everything up. The classmates and teacher feel they're doing enough. The brother takes the brunt of Kuroki's abuse and warped cries for help, but it's a little much to expect him to handle it all by himself and he does his fair share. Her only friend doesn't realize there's any problem. Kuroki can't help herself; she tries, but it all fails. She tries repeatedly, and it fails, and even her final effort in the last episode to reach the council president fails (and depressingly, she seems to realize there's a problem but to think Kuroki is working hard, which is true but sounds like an excuse to forget about the matter, and given the whole overall thrust of _Watamote_, it's hopeless to expect anything good to come out of their interactions).\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is clueless, disengaged, or covering it up. No one will help, and those who want to, can't. There is no sign that Kuroki will ever get better. That things will ever improve. She will forever be trapped in her room, trapped in her fantasies and a sad little girl outside them, unable to develop into anything or have real friends. The pervading sense is a harsh bitter hopelessness. Being resigned to despair is still a form of despair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the ANN review by Theron Martin (http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/watamote/episodes-1) does a good job reviewing the series, but I have to disagree with the summation that the tragedy is sufficiently balanced by comedy and that \"occasionally feel like it is just dumping misfortune on Tomoko, but it never goes far enough with this to negate how Tomoko creating her own misfortune makes the series' title incredibly ironic\".\\n\\n\r\nOr the series tags... 'Comedy'? 'Slice of life'? 'Morbidly funny' This is supposed to be funny? I'm supposed to laugh? You must be shitting me. If this was not intended by the creators to be a pitch-black psychological horror work (at which it succeeds nauseatingly well) almost unrelieved by any humor but that which indicts the viewer for finding it funny - they have much to answer for.\\n\\n\r\n> \"Somebody remarked: 'I can tell by my own reaction to it that this book is harmful.' But let him only wait and perhaps one day he will admit to himself that this same book has done him a great service by bringing out the hidden sickness of his heart and making it visible.\"\\n\\n\r\nKimochi warui.",

            "content": "I'll be Honest, I had the intention of dropping this anime halfway through.\r\nbut I continued to watch just to be sure about the shows ending and justify my words for a review. because Watamote is a show that couldhave been So much more!\r\nAnd i'll state right now that i'll be diving a tiny bit into spoiler territory, but no further then episode 2.\r\nThe premise of Watamote is that our protagonist Tomoko is a girl with an extreme case being the gamer/otaku type along with a huge dose of teenage Anxiety, Unable to make any form of social contact with anyone besides close family, she Hatesthe world, she hates people and mostly she hates herself for what she is.\\n\\n\r\nOn one hand I see certain things in Watamote that I've experienced myself up till the age of 15, being the outcast, playing games and watching anime on my own all summer break, having no friends around, living in the fear of not knowing how you need to change your life in a meaning full direction.\\n\\n\r\nOn The other hand The anime apperantly finds it a form of comedy to NOT have her develop from this depth in her life. There are some legitemate moments where I'm invested in the way scene's are handled. But sadly a lot of the scenes turn into cheap laughs from emberassing scenes. and this is where he shows biggest problem lies. it doesn't know if it wants to be a cheap comedy or an actual progressing story. at one moment i'm facepalming and I  pauze the video with the \" I'm done with this shit. \" line to follow, while an episode later I'm getting invested in the story again.\\n\\n\r\nThats why I want to adress episode 2, because it features Tomoko's friend Yuu from her previous school. and both these girls where on the same page. However Yuu developed more socially and Physically compared to Tomoko. But the interesting thing is Yuu, despite her developments has nobody to talk to about her anime/otaku hobby and this pains her. I'm flabbergasted the anime did not take the route to expand on that further. Those two characters using eachother to improve themselves on the fields they are weak in would be a great plot device! the same goes for a number of side characters Tomoko encounters in the serie, there are so many chances to include a likable side character she finaly had the courage of talking to into the maincast to help motivate her but it just doesn't happen. returning us to square one every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nSo instead we have to deal with Tomoko going through a nervous breakdown with uncontroled barfing for the umptieth time which just gets boring because it happens to much. \\n\\n\r\nI actually got more interested in the side characters as I kept watching.\\n\r\nI wanted to know more about Tomoko's mom, her brother or her friend Yuu, because we hardly get to see any detail about them.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like Watamote but it just doesn't go anywhere. leaving us with ultimatly nothing more then a timewaster.",

            "content": "This review contains no spoilers.\r\nWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui, or in short Watamote, is a comedy anime about an otaku girl with null social skills and her attempts to become more popular now that her high school life has begun.\r\nWhat started as a fun show filled with hilarious jokes and awkward yet relatable situations (albeit exaggerated to the extreme) quickly turned repetitive and monotonous as more episodes came in. It's one of those times where wrong expectations can kill an anime: I actually expected character development. Unfortunately, that never happened.\r\nLet's start with the characters. Tomoko is our main character, agirl with abysmal social skills or self confidence that is addicted to anime, manga and videogames. Her younger brother, Tomoki, a 'normal' guy who always has to put up with Tomoko's weird behavior, often putting a dent on his patience. And finally (yes, already), Tomoko's middle school nerdy female friend, Yuu, who not only did a 180\u00b0 turn for high school, but also grew up noticeably in many ways. Note that she's not in the same high school as Tomoko anymore, however.\\n\\n\r\nThree characters and a few episodic ones not worth mentioning, and that's it. Most if not all the episodes revolve around Tomoko's attempts to becoming more popular through a bizarre and ineffective method (often using her otaku 'knowledge') that always seem to backfire, much to her dismay. The other half of the times she's feeling out of place and lonely...  and that's it.\\n\\n\r\nIt was funny at first but then it became tedious to watch. The delivery is just too similar every single episode, nothing really happens or improves. Watamote is filled with parodies (probably one of the better aspects), delusions and awkward situations that in the end turn to despair. While the mix of sadness and comedy was nicely done most of the times, it also grew thin as the series went on. Like I already said, if I knew from the start that I should have NOT expected any development, maybe I would have liked Watamote more, yet I kept waiting for something to happen and in the end I was only disappointed time and time again.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed greatly the first 1-3 eps, then the enjoyment decayed a little more every episode up until the anti-climactic finale. You know something's wrong when by the final episodes you keep checking how much time is left until it's over, or when you start to fall asleep while watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, voice acting or sound. Nice job on those, got no complaints. Though the OP is a little overrated and unfitting. Those chains are never broken in the actual anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDetailed analysis GO!\\n\\n\r\nGeneral: \\n\r\nAtmosphere 8/10 --- Successfully showcased an otaku's life, although exaggerated for laughs.\\n\r\nCharacters  5/10 --- Too few, too little development. Tomoko was likable at first but she became a little annoying over time (because she never really changed and kept expecting different results).\\n\r\nStory development & ending 2/10 --- You could start watching any episode and not be able to tell if you're in the beginning, the middle or by the end. By episode 11 she greets her teacher in the exact same way as it happened in episode 1, that basically tells you that NOTHING actually changed, not one thing. The ending was also pathetic\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\r\nArt 8/10 --- No complaints.\\n\r\nSoundtrack 8/10 --- Okay OP, cute ED and a fitting soundtrack.\\n\r\nVoice acting 8/10 --- I think Tomoko was done greatly. I couldn't picture her sounding any different.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal:\\n\r\nPriority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 7/10 --- I never watch airing shows. I prefer to watch them once they're completely out. At first I would be hyped about a new Watamote weekly episode, but halfway or so... not that much.\\n\r\nMemorability 4/10 --- Really didn't care when it ended. I won't be remembering this one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n6/10 --- Okay\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Watamote is a decent comedy anime (especially if you can somehow relate to how accurately they represent Tomoko's problems)  and if I had to rate only the first 1-3 episodes I'd give it an 8 or even 9, but sadly taking into account the entire show I must drop it to a 6, and even then I think I'm being generous (If I had to rate the last 6 eps alone... heh).\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is not a saint, so expect some slight sexual themes and minor fanservice. I'd rate it for 12-13 years teens and older.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I got for now, I hope you enjoyed this review!\\n\\n\\n",

The good thing is that most of this absurd situations have never be seen.\r\nPace gets slower at summer break but keeps being interesting.\r\nThe main character is very good made. Motoko happens to be a lovely character who can get happy about saying aword to someone. (What I don't really get is why his brother is a bit of a dork).

            "content": "Watashi ga motenai no wa d\u014d kangaetemo omaera ga warui (try saying that three times fast) or Watamote is a slice of life comedy manga written by Tanigawa Nico and published by Square Enix. The anime adaptation was handled by Silver Link, the studio behind Baka to Test (one of the worst things I've ever seen), and they've produced nothing else I've seen. I just hope this is nothing like their other slice of life comedy or I'm in for roughly three unfunny, unpleasant and problematic jokes repeated over and over and over again until I have to go back on anti-depressants. Let's take alook. \\n\\n\r\nThe \u201cstory\u201d focuses on the High school life of Tomoko Kuroki, an unpopular girl who barely interacts with her classmates. Not that there's anything wrong with preferring solitude. The problem is that Tomoko wants to make friends and interact with people, but the only people she can talk to normally are her family and the vast majority of her social experiences come from dating sims. So, how well do the comedic elements work? To be honest, they don't. Most of the jokes are based either on Tomoko doing things that are kind of stupid or socially awkward or based on her general lack of social graces. And there's a big difference between awkward and funny. They can overlap, but they don't very often and this series isn't good enough to pull that off. Consequently, a lot of the series just drags and involves nothing of consequence or interest happening. Just long periods of Tomoko's inner monologue, which can basically be summarised as \u201cI wish I was more popular. Maybe if I tried *insert stupid thing here* I could change my image and be popular.\u201d It might have been good for a few laughs if her ideas were interesting or if the execution had been good, but that doesn't happen. Her ideas are stupid and usually lead to a few gags that you'll probably be able to see coming really quickly and which would only be mildly amusing at best if you didn't anticipate them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this aren't interesting. You've got the socially inept Tomoko. Her more popular younger brother who basically serves the purpose of pointing out her failings and occasionally giving her her comeuppance. Their parents, who are pretty much only there for reaction shots and to do generic parent things. They don't even have names, that's how generic they are. The only other important character is Yuu, Tomoko's only friend. The rest of the characters are relegated to the background and rarely get to say or do anything or they're one-shot characters who show up in an episode or two. With so few reoccurring characters, you'd think they could take some time to develop them. They don't. The only one who gets even a slight amount of development is Tomoko. Who goes from being socially inept to showing very slight signs of improvement by the end. And the series never gives you a reason to care. Yes, she's pathetic, but she's also pretty unsympathetic and her problems are almost entirely her own fault. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't very good. A lot of the animation looks kind of blocky. Furthermore, Watamote as a whole is just kind of lazy. There are a lot of scenes that linger for no real reason. The worst offender is one of Tomoko's fantasy scenes that lasts for about five minutes and has really slowly moving, stagnant art. The worst part is that there's absolutely no reason for it to go that slowly. The scene isn't funny, nor does it do anything for the narrative. My guess is that they just drug it out so they wouldn't have to animate as much. There are also scenes that get pretty much recycled. The backgrounds are pretty bare minimum as are the character designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is... okay. Kitta Izumi does a decent job of sounding painfully shy. But most of the characters don't have a range of emotions to work with so their performances end up kind of flat. Nakamura Yuuichi, for example, just sounds annoyed with every line of dialogue he's given. Hanazawa Kana gets two emotions. Vaguely excited and concerned. All in all, there's no chance for the actors to shine. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ho-yay factor is a 3/10. Tomoko has a pretty obvious crush on Yuu, at one point going so far as to fantasize about groping her. But they never do anything with it except for the occasional throw away line or scene that heavily implies it. \\n\\n\r\nThat was Watamote. Is it as bad as Baka to test? Well, no. The \u201chumour\u201d in it may fall flat and it may drag, but it's not terrible or infuriating, mostly.  The characters, as underdeveloped as they are, are still stronger than the characters in Baka to Test. But while it's not terrible, it's also not good. Watamote's biggest problem is just that it's dull. You get long stretches of nothing followed by an awkward moment that you're supposed to find funny because... Tanigawa thinks awkward equates to funny? My final rating is going to be a 3/10. I can really only recommend it if you think awkward moments are hilarious. Otherwise you're probably going to be as thoroughly unamused as I was. Next week, Dennou Coil.",

            "content": "Life is weird, stupid, and cruel. Watamote captures all of those elements perfectly while also making light of these issues.\r\nTomoko is a girl who suffers from social anxiety. She doesn't have anyone whom she can talk to about her problems, and can't even go out in public without her freaking out all the time. Seems depressing right? Well Tomoko is also rude, perverted (in the bad way), and blames all her problems on everyone else.\r\nAs much as we hate to admit it, humans are awful. Especially during puberty. It is this weird time during childhood and adulthood. Our bodies and mines are changing and weare just starting to understand \"the real world\". We turn cringy and all emotional. Plus during puberty we will have a hard time trying sex.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko is basically the embodiment of everything awful about puberty. Watamote really shows how dumb people can be at times through its comedy. If you watch this show while you are going through your awkward phase (like me) you could relate to Tomoko and learn how to better yourself by basically not being like her. If you watch this show when your out of your awkward phase you can learn how to in a way laugh at yourself and make light of things.\\n\\n\r\nI also like how Watamote handles the matter of sex in particular. Almost all of Tomoko's problems are caused by her unhealthy view on what she thinks sex is. For example Tomoko thinks that being sexual harassed is a complement. I just feel like Watamote does a great job at showing people how stupid toxic femininity really is by again, through Tomoko and how she is the example of how not to act.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I feel like everyone should watch at least one episode Watamote. Yes it is extremely cringy, but that's the point. In the end, we ALL are Tomoko. You CAN'T give Watamote a true rating really! We can't COMPREHEND how great Watamote! Watamote is a show BEYOND our time guys! We DON'T deserve Watamote!\\n\\n\r\nOkay maybe I'm getting a little carried away here, but seriously. It's a good show. It more interesting than anything. I can't even really call this show my favorite anime. I just think the idea of Tomoko is cool. You may not have the same experience with this anime that I did. I know a lot of people think this show is just a gross, cringy, mess. But I just feel like I had an experience worth sharing. I'm glad that I did.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Watamote is perfect. Also this anime has a hilarious OP. F**k you.",

            "content": "To me watamote seemed like one of the more interesting animes coming out this season, it has an interesting concept behind it and it seemed like it would be something fresh, and I enjoy it when anime tries something different and doesn't stick to a formula like alot of them do, and I wasn't disappointed with it, but I enjoyed it in a different way than I thought I would.\r\nStory- The story is about a girl named Tomoko who has spent most of her life playing games, reading manga, and watching anime, she's basically an otaku outcast, sounds familiar doesn't it? Of course not everyonethat watches anime was an outcast in school, but quite a few of us that watch anime didn't have a great social life in school and it was rather miserable. What watamote tries to do is to poke fun at that subject and make light of it, which is does do, I was laughing my ass off the entire anime (most of it anyways), but what shocked me was how depressing some of it could be. Being a social outcast isn't a fun thing, many of us didn't choose to be that way (like Tomoko), but we couldn't help it, no matter how hard some of us tried we just couldn't be popular, but is that a bad thing? Anyways the story in watamote is fairly nonsensical, it's basically about all of the crazy shit she gets into throughout her life in high school, which I think works well for the anime. It kind of fits with the whole \"i'm an outcast\" theme really well. She often gets herself into ridiculous situations that alot of us can relate to and laugh at, but some of them are quite depressing when you start to think about it. It's a fairly odd anime to be honest, but Tomoko is a fairly weird girl so it's only natural that her story would be weird. All of the jokes and scenarios were really well wrote and seemed very original to me, it feels like something I would write from personal experience, although most of the scenes are exaggerated, but still remained relatable to some degree. I did feel that the ending was on kind of a cliffhanger, but hopefully there will be a second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art in watamote isn't nothing special, although I will say that alot of the \"costumes\" that tomoko wears is hilarious. it's drawn and animated really well and everything flows nicely, nothing too out of the ordinary here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sound assets really surprised me in watamote, I practically fell in love with the intro. You can tell when work is put into something, and alot of work was put into watamote, they even made it to where one of the opening scenes blended in perfectly with the intro, which was kind of cool of them. The intro itself really spoke to me, I find that most geeks and outcasts actually listened to death metal/ heavy music and I couldn't have wished for a better intro, it's also a custom intro, they don't use a random song and instead got someone to do something custom for it, which is always appreciated and is rarely seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The main character in watamote is a fresh character. I can't really think of any of any other character that is comparable to Tomoko. She really seems like an individual and is wrote in such a way that you feel for her and don't want to laugh at the situation that she gets into, despite it being fucking hilarious. There are often badass characters in anime that are written very well, but alot of the time they're not relatable, it's hard to make a relatable character, because you have to write them from a certain point, a point that you could only write from out of experience. That's why she feels so real, because she is real in a sense. The person that wrote her more than likely went through some of the things she did in the anime, that or the person writing her personally knew someone in the same position as Tomoko. Either way they had personal experience with this kind of thing and that definitely shows because in watamote. She's an awesome character that I think more people need to know about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I really enjoyed watamote, alot more than I thought I would. it was hilarious, entertaining, and surprisingly depressing at some points. I was never left bored and was always interested in what was going to happen to her next. I enjoy things that are different, which is hard to find in anime, but just because it's different doesn't mean it's good, it has to also be good on a fundamental level, and watamote is definitely good on a fundamental level. It's only flaw would have to be that only otakus and other outcasts will really understand the subject matter, it's not highly accessible to alot of people. For me personally it's a 8/10 because it does so many things right in so many places and doesn't really mess up much in other places, although I can also see how some people would dislike, or even hate it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall I loved watamote, alot more than I though i would actually. It was a really enjoyable and well though out anime that felt realistic to a degree despite being exaggerated in some areas. it threw me some curveballs in the sense that it was more depressing than I though it would be, I was expecting it to be all comedy, but I felt myself being depressed sometimes as well, which made me have a deeper attachment to the character and make me like her ever more. I would highly reccomend this to anyone that has ever been an outcast in their life and had a hard school life, it might help you get over some of that through comedy and you might even have a good time with it. If you however haven't been in that position then you might have a hard time understanding the main character and you might not like it because of that, either way it's a fundamentally well written anime and doesn't to be as low ranked as it is in my opinion.",

            "content": "Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! or simply Wata Mote, is your not-so-typical weird show. The story centers at Kuroki Tomoko, a gloomy-looking girl who happens to be an introvert. She'd be your typical hikkikomori(shut-in) if she doesn't go to school, a loner in short. There's no certain plot to follow on Wata Mote. The series is purely comedy. We follow Tomoki's life as she tries to tread the path on becoming popular, and we laugh as she fails.\r\nI've mentioned in my past reviews that music is always crucial in a series(for me of course). Wata Mote has some amusing OST'sin it. There were 4 ending themes for it and 1 solid opening theme.  Natsuri Matsuri was done by your most popular \"vocaloid\" Hatsune Miku, I've never been a fan of her, but Natsuri Matsuri is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in Wata Mote are normal. Well, not for Tomoki. Would you watch the series if she's normal? 'Course not! She's one of the gloomiest characters I've ever seen. Some characters were made to look cool and flashy, but for Tomoko? Definitely not the case. They've put total effort into making her an ugly otaku gir(although she can still be cute at times, even though its only in her delusions.). Her fantasies(delusions) could be easily turned into their own series. The attention and detail they put on it are fantastic. But her optimism is on the highest level. If all this things happened to me? Heck, I wouldn't think twice slitting my neck to end it all. Two of the most popular seiyuus are here too, even though they're just supporting acts. Its Kugimiya Rie(who didn't have much airtime T.T) and Hanazawa Kana.\\n\\n\r\nEven though watamote is your \"weird\" type of series, it can be pretty funny and some few scenes were quite actually heartfelt. Aren't the weird types always get the masses? Although some might raise their eyebrows on watamote, I don't care. S'long as I enjoy a series and it pleases me? I don't give a shit if someone call what I watch shit. I've long accepted the fact \"you can never please everyone.\". \\n\\n\r\nOf course this really can't happen in real life, but similar events like this did happen in someone's life. Bottomline is, watamote is centered to make its viewers laugh. If you didn't laugh after watching a couple of episodes, I suggest you drop it. It means you don't like its humor, its ok, you can hate its producers and creators. Its not like they give a shit about every one of their viewers. But really, after watching a couple of episodes of Wata Mote and it didn't even make any sense to you, drop it. Or worse, add an insult if your friend asks you about it. Viewer's discretion is totally adviced on watching watamote. You'll be surprised how powerful Tomoki's delusions are. Its definitely not for the faint-hearted, but extremely funny(for my 'effin self).\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd for me, watamote really shows how a mind of a loner can be. They'd have the weirdest fantasies you could ever imagine. Shows how frail the human mind is. And it really shows that being alone is not cool? So for the kids out there who wants to be alone and thinks that being one is cool. Bullshit. I've experienced being an introvert when I was a kid, trust me, its not even one bit cool. Being left alone while everyone is having fun is not cool, at all. My mom had to consult a psychotherapist just to cure me. And now, I'm proud to say that I have friends, even though most of them are \"internet friends\". Well, everyone has their own pace, some guys really are meant to be alone, and some guys are perfect in a group. Its for you to know which group you belong. 'Kay, let's end my review here, before I retell my whole life.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall Score : 8)\\n",

Being popular isn't really normal for students and in reality only few would be popular in school, but this girl has given a new definition onto BEING UNPOPULAR. She's not popular because she don't have any friends at her school, she doesn't talk to anyone and no one talks to her, everyday in school is like her first day because she don't have any companions, no one invites her to have a lunch or eat together, in their P.E. class she doesn't participate and no one tries to invite her, she's like an invisibleperson. So as a short description, everything in this story revolves on her everyday life being a loner.\\n\\n\r\nI rated this anime high because it made me feel different emotions. Some scenes made me laugh, some were awkward - i mean awkwardly pathetic, awkwardly funny, and some were really depressing that I feel pity towards Tomoko. Another plus factor for me was the parody.

She is an absolute social outcast who doesn't really understand much about real life other than what shefaslely learns in dating sims and dumb things she puts together from online forums.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes of the show were funny, but then some of the things that she started doing that started to annoy me.

            "content": "WataMote sure took me back to my own high school days, but not necessarily in a positive light.  And because of that, I simply could not stop watching this short and bittersweet series.  Before I continue, here's some basic personal info about myself: 26, M, white, straight.  Now, how in the world could a guy like me relate to a perverted Japanese school girl like Tomoko?\r\nWell, we both like anime...but that's not quite good enough.  Here are some key traits:\r\n1. Frequently sitting alone.  Example: After summer break, Tomoko loses her seat during lunch, and winds up eating alone daily nearthe entrance to the roof.\\n\\n\r\n2. Poor communication with non-family members/close friends.  Example: At the coffee shop, she struggles with her order.\\n\\n\r\n3. Becomes emotional after a harmless lecture.  Example:  Forgetting her textbook in class, a teacher catches her and asks where it is.  After having a classmate share with her, she is unable to hold back her tears.\\n\\n\r\n4. Expressing extreme frustration and anger over trivial problems.  Example: Tomoko has her umbrella stolen, and is enraged that someone makes her walk in the rain. (Upon realizing that she had actually just misplaced it, she immediately recovers from her seething emotions.)\\n\\n\r\n5. Focused obsession over a certain hobby or interest.  Example: In middle school, she has almost disturbing knowledge about arms dealership and weapons.\\n\\n\r\n6. Freaking out about what you said or did in public.  Example: When talking to her friend on her cell, she is reminded about the aforementioned topic while they were discussing future goals, and quickly ends the call.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does this all mean?  Tomoko and I both have Asperger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism.  Naturally, I can't possibly relate to her more feminine-related incidents.  But I can understand how much worse it feels when your peers have all the success that you lack.  They don't brag on purpose, and yet it still hurts.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, WataMote has an attractive style that is meant to draw in viewers, but its purpose is not to get them to feel bad for the character.  It's to bring awareness.  I love anime, and as difficult as this was for me to watch at times, it made me happy to see anime as a medium bring some of my own difficult experiences - and many others I'm sure - into the spotlight.",

Despite all of that she has no friend and is the outcast in school, hell sometimes she goes on months without saying a word to anyone. This series focuses on her daily struggle being an otaku.\r\n+The OP & ED.\r\nI look forward to the Opening and ending songs in anime, it's always something creative and fun, Watashi's opening isno exception. The first time I watched the opening I genuinely burst out laughing as the opening turned into a heavy death metal song. Along with fluid animation it will definitely be remembered and cherished by me. The ending has it's charms too.\\n\\n\r\n+Tomoko.\\n\r\nTomoko tries everything and anything to get an increase in her social status. From wearing \"sexy\" uncomfortable underwear to looking like a slut. I can imagine many viewers can relate to her.... to some extent. She is certainly fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n+The Art.\\n\r\nOverall it's likable, vivid animation. nothing to realistic or adventurous. What more can I say.\\n\\n\r\n+The Comedy.\\n\r\n\"A bit of a mixed bag\" as some say. While at times Watashi can be rather amusing with the situations Tomoko gets herself into (eg. her job in a corporate cake making factory), other times the show in my opinion tries too hard and occasionally the jokes become cringe worthy (eg. most of her dreams/imaginations, they go on forever and we all know they won't turn out that way). The start of Watashi was very interesting to me and I got a bit addicted to it, but near the end watching the show just felt like a chore. In fact I had to force my self to watch the last few episodes. Nothing appealed to me and it felt like another dull slice of life.\\n\\n\r\n-The Ending.\\n\r\n\"It's a comedy do you expect an ending?\" Of course not but I expect some sort of development of ANYTHING, but no. In Watashi the ending was quite literally the start. \"This is a certain girl's.. A certain unpopular girl's... totally trivial story.\" I guess she is more self aware about what a otaku she is. and that is pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! is a very trivial show in my opinion with nothing making it unique, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. Give it ago if you're bored with nothing better to do.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

The anime is episodic like the western cartoons where you can probably start watching at any point without having to worry if you have missed anything. \r\nCharacter\r\nThe main character is a loner who wants to be popular. She does not develop throughout the entire series and stays the same she was in the first episode. That right there is a big redflag for any anime series that has a main character like the one in this series. There is an error in the description of the series. The main character is not a shut in since she has no problems going outside or going into crowded places if she wants to. Also i don't think this should be classified as a shounen anime since i don't think boys will be able to relate to this character as easily as girls. \\n\r\nThe girls and boys that are her age have personalities that are not believable and to make it worst, they all have the same personalities, have the same likes, dislikes and the only difference is their appearance. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion\\n\\n\r\nI found myself bored while watching this series but I kept on watching since i was killing time. This series had allot of potential and if they were not so focused on making this into a humorous story, they could have tried putting this character into a believable world and allowing her to develop into a proper member of society.",

            "content": "Well, I wrote a review 3 weeks ago but it was incomplete. Now, the anime finished so I edited my review. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is very simple, like any comedy anime, but this plot is nearer to reality because in real life we find similar cases where girls want to be popular. However, the first three episodes were fine, a little exaggerated but enjoyable, funny and easy to relate to. I didn't like the twist from episode 4 to episode 9; Tomoko goes from being a girl who wants friends, to a pervert. She also goes through more misfortunes and the anime becomes drama-like. WhatI also dislike is that somehow they make the other girls of the anime seem like uptown girls (or very feminine girls) and Tomoko as the only abnormal - that, was too exaggerated. Suddenly, in episode 10 Tomoko is no longer a pervert and the story returns at its initial point but without the comedy in episodes 1-3.\\n\r\nIt would have been great to explain something about Tomoko's relationships with her family (not just with her brother), and could give a good reason as to why the character is shy when conversing - that way, it would be easier to identify with the character as well as the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nWell, I don't usually focus on art, except when changes from the manga are remarkable. I think they improved Tomoko's design. In the manga she looks misshapen, so anime style looks better. The only thing I disliked is the way her head was shaped and the fact that she's short compared to everyone else. Tomoki's design looks like Oreki's (from Hyouka) and Hachiman's (from Yahari Seishun). A cool combination of the two.\\n\r\nI have noticed that in the first and last episodes some characters are faceless, and Tomoko's classmates look too simple and similar to each other. It isn't annoying but, in this case with only few characters developed, I expected more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters... well, character: 4/10.\\n\r\nIn the first three episodes Tomoko is shy, very shy, and clumsy, but still tolerable. However, in fourth episode twist she becomes an unpleasant character. She's still clumsy, shyer than before and a hateful pervert all the time and. Tomoko comes up with something sillier every time. I couldn't understand her... If she wanted friends she should have done a little effort to be able to have a proper conversation and think about what she says rather than doing no effort at all, since I didn't see any. Some of Tomoki's features had the potential to make a cool character but, they were wasted so, he finished as a filling character. Tomoko's best friend... Well meh, I don't like her because she has nothing special but I don't dislike her either. It would have been great if these two characters developed because it's too difficult make a cool and promising story with only one character developed. And with a character like Tomoko it's more difficult.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10.\\n\r\nAlthough this anime is entertaining, Tomoko's misadventures are enjoyable, but the detail in episode 8 onwards isn't entertaining. I wish Tomoko had done better actions to make friends, like maybe look for other type of help? Or something that a normal antisocial person would do if they wanted to become social. It would make the anime more realistic and MAYBE more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThen, the ending was too ordinary, I expected funnier stuff :/. To finish this review, I only recommend this anime if wish to remove boredom. If you're looking for a realistic story of a person without a social life, you won't find that in this anime. I also recommend to see it bit by bit, might be boring to watch all episodes in one day.",

            "content": "'GET POPULAR OR DIE TRYING' is the proper tagline for this anime. Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! or shorter words, WataMote, follows the life of a paranoic, young girl in despair; Tomoko Kuroki. SHE JUST WANTS TO BE POPULAR! What makes this anime particularly fun to watch is the mindset of Tomoko, which is very interesting. But I guess these kind of people DO ACTUALLY exist in real life. If I ever encounter one, I would like to be their friend(Seriously). Get to the PROS and CONS, now!\r\nPROS:\r\n+ Cute and unique protagonist(Tomoko kuroki is said to look ugly...really? She looksdarn CUTE to me. While she does not look anything unique, but her \"mindset\" or the way she thinks/her fantasies/her reactions can be fun to follow.)  \\n\r\n+ Creative jokes which are geniunely hilarious (I've lost count the number of times I laughed while watching this...)\\n\r\n+ Epic opening and a cute ending song(an unexpected rocking opening accompanied by a cutely themed ending are pleasant to hear)\\n\r\n+ Rewatch factor is medium-high(This is probably only for me...but at one point, I think I would rewatch this, just for the funny scenes)\\n\r\n+ Take a drink, some snacks and chill(This is the type of anime that you should sit down and relax and don't require so much brainpower to think. Just Chilllll...)\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Typical slice of life(nothing fancy, just your everyday life of a teenager)\\n\r\n- Latter half gets very dull. (While it was genuninely funny earlier, but latter half gets unfunny and quite lame.)\\n\r\n- Supporting cast are meh.(Tomoko kuroki is awesome, but supporting cast are boring. The LOL thing is, Tomoko's brother also have the dark eye patches...)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Watamote is a particularly fun anime to watch. Unique protagonist, some cool tracks to listen to, funny jokes but then got onto the FAIL side on the latter half. But even with all those flaws, it was worth spending my time on it and may be worthwhile to you(the reader) as well.\\n",

It's also an accurate depiction of the psyche of an eccentric otaku. The malicious thoughts, the equating real life scenarios to video games, the anti-social lifestyle. These are themes we all (well I know me, I can't and shouldn't speak for the rest of you) know. What truly makes this series gold is how Tomoko isn't portrayed for laughs in a malicious way. She has her struggles and while this leads to hilarious antics,it's not at the expense of her dignity, unless she does it herself. But we (I) understand her motivations. She's doing her best to fit into a world that ultimately she cannot fit into; but has no choice but to. So it goes. You root for her to succeed because she tries so hard, but in the end she can only be the Tomoko she knows how to be. That's the lesson here and a lesson for everybody everywhere. My only regret is that there isn't more episodes.",

            "content": "Simply put... this anime is a mixed bag.\r\nThe story revolves around a girl just entering High School and explores her delusions of grandeur and lack of common sense regarding simple things. The MC is dense beyond imagining and has a very warped sense of reality due to what I can only surmise is an undiagnosed mental illness. On top of that she suffers from severe depression. Needless to say, this MC is unique... and that isn't a bad thing necessarily. The appeal of this series is the MC interacting with the world. It is like watching an alien from 3rd Rock from the Sun andthere is hilarity to be had. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER... this series is incredibly depressing. It was hard to get through. The torment this girl goes through in just wanting someone to accept her, acknowledge her, talk to her, hug her... is really hard to stomach. Her episodes into exploring her misunderstandings about the world leave you cringing as you watch as everything goes awry. You should be warned... this anime is not for the light hearted.\\n\\n\r\nThe character that surprised me was her friend. Out of the blue her middle school friend calls her, a few episodes in, and wants to hang out. The way she is remembered by the MC is as a geeky, unattractive girl. The reality is that her friend bloomed into an attractive and popular girl entering high school... but retained all of her qualities from when she was unpopular. This makes for a unique character. I will be honest, I was expecting the friend to either bail on the MC or have something happen... but she was just really nice. It goes to show you that you can't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note... the MC has the same eyes as L from Death Note. Just Saiyan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is rather unique and does an amazing job of expressing the many moods of the MC.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this is amazing. The intro and outdo fit perfectly and it sets the tone for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe parts where this anime really makes it worth watching are the moments like the end of episode 11, where she gets a hug... and other heart warming scenes that make you go \"awwww.\" Trust me, in the right context, you will understand the power of a hug from someone in a bear costume. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Well..... no. Probably not. It is worth a watch if you have some free time and want to see a 12 episode show. Its on Hulu. While it isn't bad and Im glad I saw it... it just isn't one I would be like \" OH MAN, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS SHOW!\" As it stands it was a mediocre show with some great moments sprinkled in. Virtus Signum gives this a 6/10.",

            "content": "It\u2019s always nice to see that a certain anime of a specific genre hasn\u2019t followed the stereotype of almost every other anime under that genre. High school in anime appears to be like paradise, in my opinion, where teenagers spend their days having fun and participating in clubs, meeting up with friends, confessing their love to their crush, and so on. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always nice to see that there\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t follow the crowd, (which is quite fitting because of what this anime is about!)  because to introverts like our main character and moi, high school is rubbish!\r\nSTORY\r\nKuroki Tomoko is a quietand super awkward girl, who is about to enter high school, where she believes that her life will change for the better; she will be popular, etc. However, due to her lack of social skills, she fails. Horribly at times. She uses theories she discovered from playing romance visual novels, reading shoujo manga, and she knows what to expect in situations where she tries to make herself stand out. Unfortunately, something usually gets in her way, and ruins her entire plan.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an interesting plot setting, although the one large drawback it has, is that there\u2019s no progression, at all. That\u2019s why it is sometimes difficult to get through an episode, because she can\u2019t learn from her mistakes, regardless of how hard she tries.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nIf there was a female anime character that I could relate to, it\u2019s Tomoko. Many times I have tried to stand out in certain situations, I prefer to stay indoors as much as possible, I have a negative outlook on life, hell I even have bags under my eyes like she does! In terms of the whole introvert stereotype, it\u2019s pretty much perfect. Her appearance, her speech, the way she acts in (and after) embarrassing situations, her dreams of becoming popular; they\u2019re all really accurate, or at least I think they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside is that she gets into those embarrassing situations much more often than other introverts. Unlike similar characters like Hachiman Hikigaya from Oregairu, Tomoko has a tendency to act without thinking, or in short, she has a lack of common sense. This is the main reason why she gets into embarrassing situations, which are really bothersome, especially because we, the viewers know that she didn\u2019t have to get into these situations.\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are pretty much irrelevant. The focus is on Tomoko most of the time, so there isn\u2019t any real room for other characters to come into the spotlight. It isn\u2019t even needed though, as it kinda emphasizes the feeling of solitude that Tomoko has. A nice touch, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND & ANIMATION\\n\r\nI watched Watamote in Japanese dub, and I enjoyed it. Because of the lack of characters, the dub consists mainly of Tomoko\u2019s monologuing, as she thinks of her fantasies, insults everyone in her mind (another completely normal thing for introverts) and as she creates various plans of how to get popular. Other than that, she talks almost incomprehensibly when someone is talking to her. Izumi Kitta did a good job on voicing Tomoko. I like the way how she slurs her words, making her sound like a drunk.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I loved, were the common references to other popular anime like \u2018Another\u2019, \u2018K-ON!\u2019 and the Haruhi Suzumiya series. These references just made me smile, and think \u201cOh come on... SERIOUSLY?!\u201d A few of the scenes made me wonder how this anime got away with it! Sure, names of characters and groups were partially censored out, but seeing it is still ridiculously entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, well, average. Because this show isn\u2019t very dark, the music is quite humorous, with not so many tracks that stand out as being really good.  Not a bad soundtrack, but nothing spectacular. \\n\r\nOne thing that does stand out, is the opening. Screaming heavy metal music, and a mix of images that correspond to the different moods that Tomoko goes through in the anime, make an awesome opening. It is definitely one of my favourites.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is where the anime expresses itself. One moment you have normal animation for a normal peaceful scene, and in a moment you have dark gloomy colours for the moments of Tomoko\u2019s  \u201cmishaps\u201d. Special effects and filters are also well used, creating unique atmospheres. The animation for Tomoko is also really good. As I already mentioned, the visual aspect of the stereotype is really good. Pale skin, gloomy expression, messy hair, and of course those eyes...\\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\r\nEven though I praised the show, quite a bit, I still didn\u2019t enjoy it as I had hoped to. Its biggest problem by far is the lack of progression, which makes some episodes quite boring to watch. Also, the embarrassing situations Tomoko gets herself into get a bit aggravating after a while.\\n\\n\r\n The high points of the anime would be Tomoko, as she kept the show going with her personality, and also the changing styles of animation. The show had a lot going for it. If it had taken a more darker path, one that was REALLY depressing and dark, it would have been a lot better, but that\u2019s how I feel about it.\\n\\n\r\n7/10.\\n\r\nI don\u2019t recommend this show to everyone, fellow introverts can check this out, as well as people who are quite patient. \\n\r\nFor everyone else, the first 4 to 5 episodes and then you can decide on dropping it or finishing it.\\n\r\nEnjoyable, but could have done much better.\\n",

            "content": "Watamote is infamous for several of its \"awkward\" scenes that result from the main character's (Tomoko Kuroki) inability to handle most social situations properly. As a result, people who watch the anime state that the scenes tend to ruin it for them. I believe, on the other hand, that those scenes are the very heart and soul of what makes this anime so damn entertaining; the fact that you as a viewer watch this anime knowing full well that Tomoko will eventually create an insanely ridiculous situation from thin air makes it stand out from much other anime. I personally relish that scene where herdad walks in on her asleep with a vibrator in one hand and a voice of her virtual lover playing on her TV because I was laughing on the ground from the calmness in which her father handled the situation. Now reading this review, it becomes more than obvious that this show is definitely not for those who can't laugh at the insanity that the perverted mess Tomoko has to offer to her viewers. I implore those of you who don't fall in to that category to simply enjoy her blundering seemingly fool-proof social interactions because there are several deep elements that this show has to offer as well. Everyone feels somewhat lonely at times and Tomoko's more serious case gives something for the viewer to latch on to. From the hilarious reactions of her younger brother, to the almost horrifying mental hypothetical's Tomoko's show is nothing if only entertaining.",

The main character try's despertly in all ways to become popluar.  What she doesnt realize is just talk to people and you'll get some friends and that life isnt about if you have a lot of friends or not. She has a younger brother who she desides is going to help her build up some confidence. Though her brother really doesnt like this idea.       The main chracter is a chracterthat likes to play dating games on her computer or whatever game systems she has. She often has fantasy's about things that go on in the games. I liked this anime very much not only because it was funny but it deals with issues of self appearence and popularity wich most teens deal with. It has a unique topic wich draws you in. Overall i would rate this anime a 10.",

            "content": "Story (7/10):\r\nWataMote's story is simple.  If you are looking for a deep plot, look elsewhere.  Instead we get a slice-of-life style which allows the comedy and main character to shine through.\r\nArt (8/10):\r\nI found the art and animation to be simple yet high-quality.  The character designs range from good to excellent (and there are some hilarious faces/reactions).  Very good animation in the OP.  Excellent editing, especially the comedic timing.\r\nSound (10/10):\r\nTomoko's VA's performance is a major reason to watch this show.  She nails the comedy, and at the same time creates a complex, sympathetic character.  The OP is pretty good,and I loved the ending theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nTomoko is a deeply flawed character with personality issues and extreme social anxiety.  This is played for laughs, but at the same time it evokes feelings of pity and shame.  However, Tomoko is not one-dimensional.  She can be optimistic, playful, mischievous, and cute.  While she is often in a state of denial or naivete, Tomoko sometimes takes a sober look at her own flaws, wavering between despair and determination to change.  Tomoko is a real underdog and I found myself cheering for her.  Her realistic relationship with her younger brother is also executed very well.  It is not a mistake that the other characters in WataMote remain distant and unremarkable, because our protagonist obviously sees them that way.  In summary, Tomoko is a unique character who easily carries the series alone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nWataMote will evoke an emotional response - be prepared to be reminded of your own embarrassing past, and to share in Tomoko's awkward moments.  If you can handle that, the comedy will surely entertain and you will fall in love with Tomoko's character.  By the end I was wishing for more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10):\\n\r\nA LOT can be said about this show, and it deserves the discussion.  While I see it as a comedy, it is a special type of humor, only for those who can laugh at themselves.  Underneath the comedy there is a serious and very sad theme of social ineptitude which resonated with me.  The presentation is nearly flawless, and it cannot be stressed enough how amazing Tomoko's VA is.",

            "content": "What is the term for a comedy that makes you depressed instead of laughing?\r\nStory:\r\nIt's basically the same formula repeated: Tomoko tries to become popular/find a friend - she fails horribly - hilarity/cringe ensues. As a comedy, WataMote mostly fails. While it could get a good laugh out of me every now and then, most of the time I just felt either pity or embarrassment. Most viewers will find relatable qualities in Tomoko, although I seriously hope not too many of them. I don't think I've ever seen something as weird as this. Or maybe it wasn't intended to be like this and we were supposedto laugh at the loser girl? Anyway, this is a very awkward watch and not funny most of the time (though very funny when it is).\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWataMote looks quite good. During many of Tomokos fantasies/delusions, the art style shifts to something else, either a sparkly shoujo world or a cubic portrait of her or the pencil drawings that we also see in the opening. That is very creative and keeps the show from becoming too dull to look at. The character design for the main character is certainly something else, while the rest of the cast (except maybe her brother) look rather generic, though that's the point.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love the opening. Not only does it hit my taste in music, it also fits nicely with Tomokos inner anger at the world (one episode transitioned into the opening, which was pretty awesome). The ending song is another case of terrible in a cute way. Izumi Kitta does an outstanding job as Tomoko, rarely have I heard somebody living their character that much, no doubt one of the best seiyuu works I've ever heard. Everybody else does their job well too.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is a one (wo)man show anime and stands and falls with the main character. Most people will agree, that it's next to impossible to not feel sorry for her. Every teenager has gone through phases like this, and if you weren't a popular kid, it was even worse. Tomoko however is the ultimate queen of teenage angst and unpopularity. While you may laugh at one part, another will make you go \"uh, I know how that feels\". I have to state though, that much of this is her own damn fault. She rejects the world and the people around her and keeps herself from making any progress, so you shouldn't just see a victim in her. It's okay to want to see her succeed, but she also deserves some of the things happening to her. Long story short, Tomoko is a very interesting character with lots of shades. (Shout ot to Imae, who's a really nice girl)\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDid I enjoy WataMote? Yes and no. It was entertaining all the way through, but it felt uncomfortable too often to make me say I \"enjoyed\" it. Once you realize that Tomoko will never break the circle, it robs you of anything to hope or look forward to. If you have a sadistic kind of humor though, you will probably like this anime a lot. For me, it was nice to see once, but I wouldn't come back to watch it again.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

            "content": "Watamote is about a girl in high school coping with social anxiety. The comedy/tragedy however, is that she is really oblivious to it. Throughout the story, she seeks out reasons as to why she doesn't have many friends or isn't popular amongst her classmates, that derive from the point of her simply being very socially anxious and afraid to talk to people. Her reasons often become very farfetched and crazy, leading to comedic effect, and at the same time, it is depressing.\r\nThe thing I'd like to applaud the most is the anime's intro. Nothing could capture the overall message of the story better. It involvesTomoko, chained to a wall in a city street while ordinary people are occassionally passing by her. She wishes to break free of the chain but as it is, she is unpopular, a freak, tied to this fate of being seperated from the rest, unable to be with them because she's stuck, she can't reach out to others because she has a hard time speaking to them, however, throughout the song's lyrics it is more about Tomoko's perspective, instead of the reality; \"To be popular, I have to try hard\".\\n\\n\r\nI've never seen an anime intro that closely tied to the story in a deep way. It has true meaning, and it isn't difficult to understand the metaphors. Even though I'm not always a fan of Heavy Metal, I feel like the music genre is at its best in these situations: someone who's angry, disgruntled with things, literally shouting out their frustrations about their recent life situation. You don't need to look further than the first 3 seconds of the anime intro to notice what it's all about, a cry of frustration; \"AHH! THAT'S IT, NO MORE!\"\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story, there are plenty of uncomfortable moments, as you'd expect. Without giving away any specific scenarios, let's just say that poor Tomoko gets humiliated, or humiliates herself, in a massive variety of ways. Chances are you'll be able to relate to her, or at least sympathize with her. Tomoko is somewhat paranoid, and she's a heavy sufferer of what is known as \"the spotlight effect\" in psychology. She assumes people will notice every minute detail about her or things she does. It's a sad spectacle. This condition is noticeably present in a lot of people, but it's a lot worse with those suffering from social anxiety, as they're so self-conscious about themselves. There's moments in the anime where, in Tomoko's imagination, a spotlight is literally cast on her while she's in a room with other people. The symbolism only drives things further.\\n\\n\r\nPsychology aside... The entertainment factor is high. I couldn't stop as soon as I began watching, until the series was over, over a period of 3 days or so. What I liked about it most? It's the fact that this anime truly only focuses on one person. Few anime pull it off to this degree. I'm always interested in getting to know a character this much, how they feel. It's harder to get that from an anime where it's always very \"third-person\", as if you're a security camera, watching a group of people interact with one another. That isn't truly getting to know them, unlike here. And I think this is what draws me to Watamote.\\n\\n\r\nI'll definitely give it a 9. There are of course other 'personal story' anime out there, but this one is in a really contemporary setting, and therefore a lot of people can relate to Tomoko's daily struggle. I hope it gives those viewers some comfort in knowing that they're not alone with their problems, since many other viewers have also been able to relate to the poor girl. Watamote is truly a bonding experience.",

            "content": "(no spoilers)\r\nWell, I took two months to step back on my viewpoint about this anime, and I think I'm ready to write a review on it.\r\nWatamote is a very special anime, which describes humorously the sad days of an unpopular school girl. And depending the viewpoint you will take when watching it, you will like it or dislike it. It really FULLY depends on that, and that's why the opinions are very contrasted.\r\nArt : 7/10\r\nStudio : Silver Link\r\nReally nothing to complain here, the graphics are watchable. Nothing exceptional though. The efforts put especially on the main character design is really noticeable and enjoyable.\r\nSound : 7/10\r\nTheOST were fitting to the scenes. Nothing exceptional again. I was hoping for more effort.\\n\r\nBonus point for the opening, though. Really awesome, I'm still listening it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nTomoko's character is really unique. With an appearance of a stereotypical unsociable girl, her personality is authentic, in a stereotyped world. What the scenarist did is awesome here, because every classmate of Tomoko will see her as the stereotypical unsociable girl, but here, we're seeing the exact opposite. Big green thumb for the scenarist, who transmitted successfully the message he wanted to transmit.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8/10\\n\r\nEven if the scenario is repetitive and quite predictable when it comes to Tomoko, the scenarist managed to build a complete story which leaves absolutely no gaps anywhere. He condensed everything he had to include and the result is really not bad, contrary to some animes where the story is rushed. Nice job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where a lot of opinions will be contrasted. I'm sure everybody understood the story, but how the player will take it will vary only on himself, and will considerably change his opinion.\\n\r\nWithout spoiling, to be honest, I think the story may be considered as a drama. Some people may even feel more bad when they're watching this than when they're watching a real drama. Other people will just take it lightly and laugh. And that's the morale of the story.\\n\r\nThis is a big message for everyone who thinks they currently have a sad school life. \"There is worser than your life, and the best way to bear it is to take it lightly, and laugh at yourself.\"\\n\r\nSo basically, if you look the anime with an internal viewpoint (from Tomoko's viewpoint), you will feel very bad for her and you may dislike this anime, because what she lives is the last thing you want to live in your whole life.\\n\r\nThat's why I'd advice to watch this anime from an external viewpoint. Just witness of her life and laugh at it, as how you should take it, from the scenarist's viewpoint.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a drama. This is a comedy. Don't forget it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10~",

            "content": "Watamote is an anime that definitely leaves a mark on people who watch it, whether they liked the anime or not. More or less, the plot is about a VERY lonely girl who just wishes to be popular.\r\n I've seen people who adore this show, and people who say they couldn't get past the second episode, unable to bear the second-hand embarrassment. As for me, I honestly adored this series! It's...different, a lot different than your usual 'shy girl's misadventures at school' series, and I think the anime's biggest strength (or deal-breaker, for the people who dislike this anime) is Tomoko herself.\r\nTomoko is, honestly, apretty garbage individual. She can be mean-spirited, perverted, embarrassing and her inner monologue is downright offensive at times. I LOVE HER. Yes, I gotta say, for being such a trashy character, I adored this little shit. Maybe it's because she was INTENTIONALLY written as being trashy and mean-spirited, and not just a badly written character, is what I like so much about her. She's also pretty dang adorable, in her own way.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not about a shy, sweet, kind-hearted girl's journey to be popular. This anime wasn't afraid to have a 100% out of the norm, offensive, and different main character, and I love that. \\n\\n\r\nTomoko definitely has her genuinely nice moments, though. She seems to feel/act just a little better when she's hanging with her friend Yuu-chan (who she seems to have more than a bit of an attraction to, which is great ;D) and there are times when I do really, really feel for her. The poor thing can barely speak a word to anyone without stuttering, and episode 11 really got me in terms of making me feel bad for Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were both perfect. This anime really does different things with it's animation sometimes, and it makes the anime itself more endearing and gives it an even more unique feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was god tier for me. The OP was...honestly perfect, with a mixture of death metal and pop coupled with amazing visuals and symbolism. They put just as much effort into the ED too, giving it a happier tone but be just as dark in terms of lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko's voice actress deserves so many props for her role. She captured the mean, passionate tone in Tomoko's inner thoughts perfectly, while also doing amazingly at her soft-voiced stuttering. Perfect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is for someone who's not afraid to have a main character who's kind of an asshole, and also someone who doesn't give into second-hand embarrassment easily. The one complaint I have is that I'd have loved to see Tomoko have a bit more developement, and maybe gain more friends. But the manga is currently ongoing, so I have my hopes for a season 2!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Watamote has left me feeling incredibly...strange.\r\n After a few episodes, I had to pause and reflect upon what I had just seen, and how it felt way too real. So many times when I see anime, I expect a story that has a happy ending, or at least will make me smile. You expect all the ends to be tied up nice, and to be left with a positive feeling toward the end of a show.\r\nWatamote doesn't do that. That is to the show's benefit, however.\r\nWatamote is an anime about a young girl named Tomoko transitioning from Middle School to high School, and how sheis attempting to overcome her strong social anxiety to have the best High School experience ever. Every time Tomoko attempts to step out of her funk, however, she is met with another mental battle...Usually leading to a failure.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let me say that Watamote is hard to review; at times, it hard to watch. If you do not sympathize with the lead or at least understand what she is going through, then I can totally understand why a lot of this anime can come off as mean-spirited or cruel. This is MY review, however, and honestly no matter how I look at Watamote, I love it. It made me uncomfortable, it hurt to watch, and it broke me at points...and I loved every bit of it. I have a personal love for this anime, and earnestly believe it is an amazing anime. I HAD to put myself in Tomoko's shoes because I have gone through what she has; if you have trouble putting yourself in Tomoko's shoes, you probably aren't going to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know this show is described as a comedy, and while it did make me laugh quite a bit with how relatable and silly some of the scenarios were, I honestly found myself holding back tears most of the time. I wouldn't call this anime a comedy, unless you want to compare your life to Tomoko's and realize how better your own life is. Some people do genuinely doing that, but from my perspective I have been in most of Tomoko's situations. I've passed out in school because I have anemia, I ate alone in the bathroom with my 3DS so no one would bother me, and I hated people in High school. I completely understand Tomoko's train of thought. I now know a lot of what I did in High school was pretty cringeworthy, which made watching Tomoko experience the same things all the more sad, and painful...but completely understandable. Simply put, Tomoko wants to be accepted. Sometimes, when you want something enough, you are willing to do anything to achieve it. Tomoko's drive to want something better for her life is what kept me watching the anime, but it was the inevitable failures of her plans to succeed that made me want to mute my computer volume, and leave in a broken heap. \\n\\n\r\nIs that a bad thing? Not to me. I found this show so relatable, it allowed me to look at my own short comings, and how I want to change for the better. \\n\\n\r\nTomoko does do some stupid things, and she does put herself in some rotten positions. Despite how much I love Tomoko, to say that she didn't deserve a lot of what was going to happen to her for doing stupid things would be a lie. Isn't that the point of this anime though? \"Social anxiety can make some of us do crazy things, and those crazy things usually don't mix well with the real world.\" This anime see's a problem, social anxiety, and decided to play it straight without any over simplified lens. I think it did a spectacular job at shining a light on an often over-looked issue. Is that light really bright? Yes, but why should something as crippling as social anxiety be toned down? Simply because it makes some people uncomfortable? Social anxiety itself makes thousands of people uncomfortable every day; if you are made uncomfortable because you are the one being laughed from Tomoko's point of view in this anime, imagine being a person who has gone through something like this. It isn't pretty, and this show does a good job representing that. \\n\\n\r\nTomoko has her own thought process, mixed with pessimism, cockiness and social anxiety, that usually wind her up in hot water. I do believe the situations she finds herself in allowed Tomoko to grow, not much, but grow some toward the end of the series; especially during the cultural festival.\\n\\n\r\n Tomoko also does have a lot of people that care about her; her cousin Kii, her friend Yu, her brother Tomoki, and the student council president Megumi Imae. Also, not every situation Tomoko is in is horrible. Tomoko does see some success; and when that happens you cheer right along with her. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I think Watamote is an amazing anime, and something that really stands out in terms of plot, and character development. I had an amazing time watching Watamote, I got invested in Tomoko's situations, and her daily life. This anime did an amazing job covering such a misunderstood subject, from a very real and scary place.  \\n",

I really enjoyed it purely because it reflects the struggles and the story of a shy, easily embarrassed girl dealing with a form of social anxiety. It shows the amount of stress high school seems to put her through, and some parts of the anime make you feel much sympathy for the main character, yet other parts make you laugh. I'd say that this anime contains an assortment of funny moments and all sad (ish) moments. \r\nI highly recommend this anime to anyonewho is looking for a unique anime to really reflect on. However, the only disappointment in the story is that the development of the story is severely lacking. Despite this, the story is very easy to follow but it often repeats itself. Not only that, the character development on the main protagonist is very good, because we are able to see her innermost emotions throughout every situation.\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime because the art is very unique and the sound was good. As well as that, some people may not like this factor, but there were quite a few characters, but not loads like many other animes. This was something that I liked because it meant that the plot was very easy to follow and it also meant that not many of the characters would intefere with the struggles of each individual.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Absent of consistent tone but with some great moments. Watamote follows the life of an extreme social outcast. Whilst I myself am not the most socially literate being, I found myself unable to relate to nearly anything in the show. It is actually rather depressing to watch as a girl who clearly is beyond the normal level of social awkwardness isn't given any help by her parents, brother or classmates, making the show rather mean-spirited.\r\nIs a depressing show about the life of a shut in automatically a bad thing? No. But Watamote doesn't resolve any of the issues in the show, nor does it haveenough depth about the issues it is raising about social isolation. Instead, the show tries to be a comedy, and whilst some moments are very funny, the show is simply too dark and depressing to be watching for comedic purposes. If I want to watch a comedic slice of life show about slightly socially awkward girls, the anime world has me covered. If I want to watch a depressing slice of reality, the anime world also has me covered. Watamote is split between two genres that just don't meld together very easily.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that the show has continuation in the form of manga, but the 12 episode anime just doesn't have any form of satisfying conclusion and falls into the trap of the dreaded unresolved 12 episode anime menace. A strong conclusion or some character development could have made this show go from a 5/10 to potentially a 10/10.  But put quite simply, unless you are planning on continuing the show through the manga, there is no reason to view this show. It will only leave you with an empty feeling.\\n\\n\r\nIf the purpose of the show was to make the audience laugh at Tomoko, it doesn't work, I only feel sorry for her. If it was to relate to her, then perhaps she could have been made slightly less pathetic. If it was for catharsis, perhaps the show should have continued to the point of having a satisfying pay off. None of these things are really achieved. The one good point I will make about the show is the way the art and anime medium is used for effect, with Tomoko's emotions being portrayed in many creative visual ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give the show a 5/10. I would not recommend it unless you like shows that do nothing but depress and anger you. There is much wasted potential here and I partially blame the standardized 12 episode format for that. This anime needed to be longer so the character development could kick in. Nothing is achieved in this anime by the protagonist. Skip to episode 12 and she is just as pathetic as she was in episode 1, and that is just sad...",

            "content": "Gonna keep it short:\r\nThe anime based on the manga is about a girl, Tomoko, with little to no social skills.  She is also prone to social anxiety, if you can call it that.  Heard the premise before?  Well it's different, because there is no sugarcoating Tomoko's personality or the events that surround her.  \r\nThe mannerisms of the Tomoko seem very over the top at times, but to me it represents her inner turmoil, what she's thinking constantly, and that really brings the character to life.  \r\nWhat I loved most about the anime wasn't how bad the situations got for her,but how brutally honest the writing was.  Usually, the writing will make these sort of characters more sympathetic, having some sort of painful past.  Not with Watamote, no sir.  You get the real deal and the whole package with Tomoko, even if some of those parts are detestable.  Human's are not perfect, and it's good to see a character that can reflect that idea.  I love the fact that people who can relate to Tomoko in one way or another cannot deny some of their own flaws ie. feeling misguided resentment for one's own social shortcomings (\"they're just sluts anyways!\").\\n\\n\r\n*So with that said, if you either can't deal with depressing subject matter (you will be a little depressed regardless of the humor) or you can't accept some of the flaws you and Tomoko may share, don't watch the show.  It will be painful\\n\\n",

Now Kuroki is a pretty damn relatable character and an entertaining one at that with all the funny shit that goes on in her head like various anime references. As far as characters go I had absolutely no problems with them as I kind of liked most of them.\\n\r\nNow my big problem with this anime which to me is a big hindrance is the ending, there kind of isn't an ending nor any resolution to the show, no over arching story, and with that I feel there is a lot of wasted potential as Kuroki's dilemma of being the unpopular girl never really gets resolved, she never comes out of her shell and her character never really develops which doesn't spoil much considering that the only thing in this show that actually progresses is time and personally I felt kind of disappointed in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is definitely the one thing that holds up though out the entire series, the character designs are simple yet detailed especially Kuroki who kind of looks like a goth chick at times. The animation with all the shot angles was creative and smooth for the most part.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack through the show was kind of forgettable but the opening song defiantly wasn't and makes up for it a little.\\n\\n\r\nSub/Dub:\\n\r\nI don't have much to say except that the dub is one of Sentai Filmworks better works but isn't all that big a deal so I couldn't really care less about either version of this show.\\n\r\nOne fun fact about the english dub is in one of the last episodes, the show makes a reference to an anime called \"Another\" where Kuroki is Mei Misaki (the chick with the eyepatch) and I thought it was kind of funny considering both of those characters were voiced by Monica Rial; the same VA.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nI'm rating this anime a 5/10, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to anyone but I wouldn't say it was a bad anime either.",

            "content": "~ A girl that doesn't really matter ~\r\nI know I've used this word a fair amount during recent reviews, but i can't think of anything more appropriate. Wakamote is a very intimate and personal depiction of a girl - who may as well not exist in the eyes of her classmates. \r\nOtaku, Mojo, Recluse, Dysfunctional, Shut-in... Once you step into the shoes of Tomoko - who appears to closely relate to all of these terms, you'll understand loneliness and social anxiety on a whole new level.\r\nDue to this blatantly dark overriding theme, you'd think it would be quite a depressing anime to watch. While itis all very tragic when put into into perspective, Wakamote utilises a conflicting combination of comedy, realism and SoL styled expression that makes it quite a peculiar watch.\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, Wakamote, from start to finish unfolds through the eyes (and mind for that matter) of our beloved heroine: Tomoko. The show makes use of powerful SoL elements such as expression of her thought processes - through mental monologues and rants, and the inclusion of exaggerating, comedic visuals. Ultimately, this combination allows for the anime to be extremely expressive, and therefore easier to get into.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot line is simply Tomoko's journey through typical high school life, as she tries to make use of radical, and often illogical methods to become popular - which ironically would make her a less interesting, less edgy and relatable character if this were an easy feat for her. As an anime that incorporates a lot of SoL themes, it's main strength shines through the character craft more so than the chronological order of events - which is definitely something to keep in mind if you weren't already aware.\\n\\n\r\nNow when i say characters, i basically just mean Tomoko when it comes to Wakamote; as she is the only properly developed presence - talk about putting all your eggs in one basket huh Sqaure Enix. Fortunately, having Tomoko as the particularly blatant focal point of the franchise did wonders for the show's atmosphere from a wider scope. Having only one character that you truly get to experience the personality of, made the series seem more intimately detailed, personal, and gave a great sense of defiance of, and struggle against modern society.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko thinks and speaks a lot of truth i must say; and her particularly lonesome lifestyle is definately not far fetched or alien. Despite how the comedy side of the show makes her out to be a bit of a freak, i feel that Tomoko gives Wakamote all of its charm, as a lot of the social topics covered and presented as serious undertones throughout are just so relatable for many. Obviously not to this extent, but i can definitely resonate from experience with Tomoko's plight, as that's really what the show is about...\\n\\n\r\nWakamote is a tragic and serious, yet lighthearted and charming, awareness-raising expression of a variety of everyday social plights. Some may find comfort this realism, whereas others may simply laugh at Tomoko's eventful, and yet lonely life. No matter which side of the fence you're on, i'd say that those who're looking for a SoL that's not entirely rainbows and lolipops have found a good match. Looking back at the series, it would have been nice to have some sequential story presentation to compliment Tomoko's journey of self-discovery, or more appropriately: self-confirmation...  But asides from this, and the general lack of depth - mostly down to general time-scaling, i thoroughly enjoyed the show.\\n\r\nMostly i'd say this was because i enjoyed the refreshing craft of Tomoko as a character - and so it was a pleasure to get to better understand her slightly psychopathic personality (like mine).\\n\\n\r\n~ No matter how i look at it. It's you guys' fault i'm not popular! ~\\n\\n",

I only give this rating when a show is not only perfect, but expands my horizons with regard to what I think is possible with the medium.\r\nI'd never thought it was possible to relate to an anime so much as I did with WataMote.  The few characters that are featured are written with a brutally realistic depth, and the show is the only example of what I might call \"Slice of True Life\".  The realistic juxtaposition of narcissism and depression incarnated in Tomoko Kuroki belies a characterdepth and understanding of humanity usually only displayed by therapists and other psychology professionals.  There was never a choice made with regard to the writing that I didn't find believable and, on a fundamental level, correct for the character.  Lying to people relentlessly, cheating, mentally insulting strangers, every bit of it was exactly who I was in middle school.  The way she is utterly alone in her pain is almost never expressed in anime, but this show treats loneliness like an old friend, joking with it, laughing as it dies inside.  This is so much closer to the reality of being a lonely but narcissistic kid.  The meta-commentary never ceases to be hilarious, which at first I thought might just be unintentional, but in the beginning of the OVA they pretty much spell out that they understand the metacritical implications of their storywriting.  Some people say this show is too cringey, but I usually hate schadenfreude comedy and I love this show.  It feels less to me like they're trying to get the audience to laugh at her than it feels like the audience is laughing at her despite the author's wish to engender sympathy, which of course is icing on the metacritical cake.\\n\\n\r\nI could write an essay on WataMote, so I'll stop here.  Suffice to say I think this is the best Slice of Life anime ever, and that I'd recommend this anime to absolutely anyone.",

            "content": "This show was hard to watch. Not that this show was bad, quite the opposite really. I myself have struggled with anxiety throughout my life. Not to the extent that Tomoko has with her intense social anxiety but had to deal with none the less. So many times I was cringing really hard mainly due the fact that I related on a very hard level with what was going on. The imagery used in any of Tomoko's \"dreams\" was easily the highlight charm of the show. Every time we see Tomoko fantasize about being popular or even her reaction to whatever scheme blew up inher face is largely played up for comedy. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not to say that the show didn't have nuance to it. Every single one of these moments were very poignant in how they went wrong or highlighted one of Tomoko's many many flaws and I loved that. Speaking from personal experience through some of my worst anxious moments these scenes conveyed a clear message as to what was going through Tomoko's head through it's intense imagery that just resonated with me.\\n\\n\r\n Tomoko is not the world greatest person obviously, but the fact that she tries and tries to make her life a bit better (even though it's far fetched and sometimes insane the stuff she thinks of) just makes her really endearing as a character. If you're someone who has dealt with, or is currently dealing with anxiety or depression I would 100% give this one a watch.",

            "content": "No. 1: This is a GAG anime not a romantic comedy, This show really only can compare to Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh. Almost all other gag animes follow the 5 minute formula, but not WataMote,  Silver Link gambled on full length episodes adapted from what is essentially a bunch of one off comic strips. They weaved the jokes so seamlessly that viewers still believe there will be character development or an overarching story or \"plot\" when in reality, \"These are the jokes folks\" Tomoko won't be changing her formula any more than Dennis the Menace or Garfield will change theirs.\r\nWhen it comes tomusic and sound there was no contest that season or even year. It's not even fair to gatchaman and danganronpa. All bow down before the mighty score and soundtrack of WataMote.  Every other episode we were treated to a special customized exit song by a popular band or musician. Even Kana Hanazawa and Hatsune Miku got in on the action. I mean come on!\\n\\n\r\nRegarding story I wouldn't call it a slice of life,it's more of a deconstructed slice of life. Tomoko is a big Japanese pop culture nerd, but none of her schemes ever match up to the fantasies of the light novels or videogames she uses for life manuals. This is where the humor stems from and it is unbelievable, after pausing the show for a few and bracing yourself, you will bust a gut. She's a big woobie always trying her best despite countless failures and this is what life really is, getting up and trying again, this makes her very relatable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art really held its own. There wasn't any obvious production budget issues where you could tell it was rushed or they ran out of money. It was fairly consistent throughout. Some of my favorite details were the changing of the seasons, the sunsets, and the soul shattering revelation picassos. \\n\\n\r\nFan service was high in areas of parody and homages, I believe there is a large wiki somewhere devoted to chronicling what shows were referenced. There was one scene where they beautifully mixed terra formars, haruhi and attack on titan all in one. The few ecchi scenes involving sexual harassment and her friend yu were clever and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThis comedy is not for everyone, it is an acquired taste. I would call the humor in this series as the closest thing to high art there is in anime comedy. It is new, it is ugly, it is raw, it is scary, it is honest, it is relatable. If you can take cringe humor ala the office, Seinfeld or louie, you will love it, if you don't take a pass.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so before you watch watamote, I want you to ask yourself-am i a critic? If you are you'll probably find yourself being highly let down and pessimistic during most of the anime, but if you are a forgiving anime watcher, then I highly implore you give this anime a chance.\r\nStory-The story is generally pretty basic with a narrow storyline, of which serves as no more than a guideline for the character tomoki. Since this anime is -dare i say it- a slice of life the story is actually pretty small within each episode. Its fair enough of though, earning a solid 6\\1O.\r\nArt-The artwork ismostly centralized on portraying tomoki's awkward, hermit-like appearance, and it is spot on. The other characters are generally generic, but they play very little roles anyway. Also their is a lot of cartoon style artwork for comedic relief, and it does do well for shits and giggles. A strong 9\\1O.\\n\\n\r\nSound-Their isn't even much sound thorought the anime, but the angst ridden pop-metalcore intro is really badass. The outro is pretty good too, due to tomokis terrible but kawaii singing. Seriously, it makes me shrivel with its levels of kawaii. sound is a 9\\1O.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-The character is really the meat and potatos of this anime, and the only part that actually matters. Their is not much character outside of tomokis because the other characters are explored little. So, on that note, what about tomoki? Initially tomoki is really pitiful, pathetic, overall just really dissapointing. She squanders every oppurtunity to make friends and escape her cage. Plus, many of the situations in which she creates are so awkward they make you cringe. The writer obviously did not see the fine line between relatable humor and highly uncomfortable situations. However, there is a lot of funny brother sister moments that kind of alleviate this, but only somewhat. Despite this kind of back and forth rollercoaster the ending is highly redeeming as tomoki finally accepts herself and is happy with herself for all of the socially awkward teen she is. The ending is a little bittersweet as she doesnt ever make any freinds but as long as your still positive and hopeful (which will be a task) you'll see a lot of fullfillment in this and just...relief. Tomoki's character is a rollercoaster and for that, i'll give it a 7\\1O.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Its kind of muddled between shits and giggles laughter and cringeworthy awkwardness, so i'll only give it a 6\\1O.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-In the end the anime redeems itself, coming to a bittersweet conclusion after just constant an endless battering of confusion and dissapointment (of which is broken up with real comedy occasionaly.) i recommend you watch it and form your own conclusions, because it really is an anime that divides people. for me it, i give it a 7\\1O, but again, you may love it or hate it.\\n",

Watamote is different- it puts the spotlight on the harsh reality that social misfits and friendless high-school out-casts are that way for a reason through the main protagonist, Tomako. \r\nWatamote is hilariously charming, and at times frighteningly relatable. The only reason I can see someone would not enjoy this show is if they were a hard-core Otaku who likesto think of themselves more of a calm and cool Hyouka, Kodaka or Kyon than a socially-awkward Tomako.",

The characters never make substantial change or their achieve goals. (plus prospects for a season 2 aren't looking good, so it's likely to stay that way.)\r\n-The jokes get old after about the halfway point for me, so now that I know the plot goes nowhere there is really no reason to watch it again.\r\nI still recommend this series because it does such a good job portraying whatit's like to feel socially crippled... and for that I shall remember it fondly.",

            "content": "Watamote is very a very enjoyable show. It is basically about the trials a girl with social anxiety have to go through trying to be the most popular girl in school. And of course she utterly fails at everything she does. As someone that does have social anxiety, i relate to this so much. They however do exaggerate things a little but that is what makes this show so fun to watch. Also, the occasional crude humor helps too. I personally believe this how is suppose to be targeted at people who have some form of social anxiety as they are the ones who canrelate to the show the most.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThere isnt much i can say in terms of story as this show is every episodic. But i can say that each trial she goes through, to me at least, is written pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nThis is the part where i believe most people think was done marvelously. The animation and the way the character is drawn fits perfectly to the tone of the situation and how the character feels. Even in scenes where nothing spectacular is going on, lets say walking, the way it is depicted is extremely visually pleasing. I have to mention the opening as it was done really well too. You just have to see it to fully understand how well it was done.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe voice actor for Tomoko ( the main character ) was SOOOO GOOD. The voice she gives for each different emotion sounds so distinct. I remember a scene where Tomoko is acting all cold and mighty, and the change from the scared little girl, to the mature and 'i dont care about you' girl so just sooooo (Y)(Y)(Y). The background music for different scenes also fits the atmosphere really well.\\n\\n\r\nI REALLLY enjoyed this show as i was watching it. Seeing Tomoko fail at everything and getting embarrass at small little things is just so funny. Though sometimes i really pity her too. I've seen in wiki that when it was airing, people debated whether it was 'a comedy or a study of neurosis'. Im like its just a freaking comedy anime. Chill~~ Anyways, overall i give this show a 8/10, and think that you should definitely check this show out just to give yourself a good laugh.\\n\\n",

They\u2019re shows that tell me, \u201cWe know you love this garbage. Remember to buy the blu-rays and any shit with their faces printed on it.\u201d So when something comes along that doesn\u2019t pander I\u2019m caught off guard; something with a meaningful character I\u2019m reminded that I\u2019m still a person that just wants a connection to another human being. Tomoko, the main character, isn\u2019t cute and she doesn\u2019t do cute things. To put it gently\u2026 she\u2019s a fucking loser.\r\nAnd I loveit.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a genre of humor called cringe comedy. A good example is The Office. It\u2019s a type of humor where we watch characters get put into awkward situations. You\u2019ll be embarrassed for them, but you\u2019ll be glad they\u2019re not you. Except, sometimes the circumstances will hit too close to home. You\u2019ll get a little PTSD about high school (or the war). What happens to Tomoko will feel very familiar to a lot of you.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s part of what I loved about the show. There are moments that will feel like it was lifted right out of somebody\u2019s life\u2014and it was! Apparently, the author took a lot of stories from her own school days. But what I loved more was how real Tomoko felt.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s a disgusting, awkward, pretentious, lonely, procrastinating, daydreaming, petty, delusional nerd.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve got no complaints. It ends abruptly because it\u2019s only an adaptation so enjoy the show for what it is. Blu-ray sales were low in Japan (which proves those moonspeakers have no taste). But good news is this did better overseas.",

            "content": "Watamote, is sad and cringy. The story follows Tomoko and her escapades to become popular and overcome anxiety. Antics ensue. As a character, Tomoko is somewhat likeable, as you can't help but hope that she succeeds in her endeavors, but the ways she gets herself into situations almost makes her deserve it. \r\nThe art is good. I especially like the exaggerated lighting and character redesigns during the daydream sequences.\r\nThe sound is good. The ending songs and the songs near the end are really awesome. Though, the opening can get some getting used to, as it doesn't really fit the tone of the show. The soundtrackisn't really noticable unless its the highlight of a certain scene, but its adequate. I can't really preach for the voice acting, since I watched the sub.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was great! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Watamote is a sad story told in a comedic way, and it has really good comedy (why wouldn't it, its a comedy show). There are some touching moments. But, not everyone will like this show. There are some serious cringy moments, and if you haven't watched a lot of anime then some references will go over your head. I personally cringed as much as I laughed, however, not everyone will do the same. If you don't like the first episode, then don't watch as the others are basically along the same lines. Happy anime watching!",

            "content": "What a ride, Cringe the anime.\r\nWatashi isn\u00b4t your usuel slice of life anime nor is it your usual comedy anime, this is a very dark comedy anime which can be quite harsh some times. For me it somewhat reminded me of school days (yes I like school days), we are following a person who is falling deeper and deeper in abyss of despair, you know for every episode that it isn\u00b4t going to get better but you still have this little hope inside of you, wishing for it will go well. \r\nEven though the anime is quite dark, it has its many really lovely andhilarious moments which are brilliant! but that entirely depends on your kind of humor :D THis is definitely not an anime for everyone\u00b4s taste.  \\n\\n\r\nWatashi can seem quite random at first but I think that it does have a meaning and lesson that we should all learn especially animefans. Most animes we see that either the power of friendship or enough determination will resolve everything! but what about those people who got no friends? And what\u00b4about having determination? We learn in anime that if you put your mind to it then you can do it, but is that really true? What about skills? what about even luck? There is more into things success than only determination, and also you can also try too much which this anime shows perfectly!\\n\r\nAlso Watashi gives a big sucker punch for those animefans who \"romantice\" different archetypes because even though in the world of anime a tsundere is normally likeable and such, in the real world... probably not so much. :) So yeah don\u00b4t count too much on the things which we learn from anime but also those advices and such from the real life.\\n\r\nWatashi for me tried also to point out all the many demands of society of how to be popular and yeah there are f**king many demands to live up to! and there isn\u00b4t much room for different people, being popular is somewhat a archetype itself... \\n\r\nOnly real openhearted people like the two female characters which we meet in this anime, they are the only ones who acknowledge Tomoko in her own way. \\n\\n\r\nthe rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things\\n\r\n- This is not an average slice of life, highschool comedy (for me it is a plus besides I get bored of the normal classic high school dramas)\\n\r\n- Its animation is simply but uses a lot of different lovely artistic effects to really make us see the world from Tomokos eyes and portray her feelings (I love the fact that most people around her has no faces, this really highlights how little she is involved in the world around her)\\n\r\n- The voice acting of Tomoko in sub is quite perfect!\\n\r\n- The opening and especially the fourth ending are for me very good!!\\n\r\n- No plot you say? I really don\u00b4t understand the people who says that this has no plot, yes it does not go from A to B but it is entirely based on the concept of Tomoko trying to get popular and often with a different approach every episode, so it is not pure randomness at all.\\n\r\n- 12 episodes without really feeling that there was missing something is a accomplishment itself! (of course it ends like a chapter because *Spoilers*, but I think that it still was a good ending, a satisfying ending without being one c**kblocking ending)\\n\r\n- The artstyle design of Tomoko is quite great, she has a character design which would always be recognized because I haven\u00b4t seen anime character design which looks like her! :)\\n\\n\r\nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons \\n\r\n- If you don\u00b4t like Tomoko as a character you will hate this anime because it is entirely depended on her. (so it is either a love or hate anime)\\n\r\n- Yes it is cringe the anime and yes a few scenes I only saw it partly while I was covering my face because I couldn\u00b4t handle the cringe XD\\n\r\n- It is a dark anime and the ending is not your average happy ending, therefore I am reminded of school days (even though it has not that schocking ending but Watashi still leaves you with this feeling of despair :) and yeah quite a handful of people would probably not be happy about that, but I loved it!)\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Definitely, just a few episodes would be good, just like it is recommended to see the first episodes of Serial experiments lain, it is a experience which needs to be tried because really just like Serial experiments lain is quite the special snowflake among the psychological thrillers of anime then Watashi is the special snowflake among high school comedies :) So yeah watch two episode if you don\u00b4t like it stop and take it as a experience, if you liked it, welcome to the ride!",

            "content": "Humph, no matter how I look at it, it's YOUR fault i'm not popular!\r\nThis, THIS anime, certainly up there with the unique anime like FLCL and Kill la Kill. While I'm sure the concept of a introvert otaku is not completely new, the way this anime portrays it....\r\nI've never had so much pain.\r\nNever before I thought I would find an anime that could make me feel pain, cringe, laughter and sorrow, at the same time.\r\nI've read before this anime would be hard to watch, but I was truly surprised to see how much I could suffer in one episode, thankfully it gets a little bitbetter as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as I look past the awkwardness this anime has, It is actually quite funny.\\n\r\nThis anime is a perfect example of how fantasy can be WAY different than reality.\\n\r\nLots of people say it's either a hit or miss, and for me, it was a hit.\\n\\n\r\nDon't think that if you watch this anime it will make you feel better because your not as bad as Tomoko, it will make you feel sorrow for her.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the visuals and music.\\n\r\nI personally love visuals that has lots of different style changes at the right moment.\\n\r\nAnime like Baka and Test and this anime of course I enjoy a lot. WataMote's sound is...\\n\r\nprobably not for everyone with it's strangely over-the-top opening with a not-quite-right sung ending, they probably won't be your favorite songs, but it fits well for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI think I enjoyed this anime for what it made me feel, than the actual anime itself, like I said before some of the ways Tomoko reacts in her situations can become almost unbearable. Numerous times I've had to pause the video and just face palm for a few seconds before bracing myself to see what she would do. \\n\\n\r\nBut still, whether it's good or not depends on you. If juvenile awkwardness at it's finest is your thing then go ahead. If you don't wanna cringe and face palm ALOT, then maybe you should stay away.\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review!",

            "content": "Watamote is one of those occasional titles I come across where even with all the years I've watched anime, I'm not sure what to completely make of it. The series appears to be a sort of black comedy focusing on how pathetic, and sometimes selfish, Tomoko's character can be in regards of her perceptions to high school life based off her otome dating sim games that she is known to regularly playing and those perceptions getting shot down when she realizes things in reality don't play out as they do in her games. She's a social outcast, has a disheveled appearance, doesn't have very manyfriends, gets nervous talking with those unfamiliar to her and has a rather rocky relationship with her family; with all of this played off for laughs and also being played as somewhat serious as a character exploration of Tomako having to look into her own personal flaws with why she doesn't get the reactions she would seek to get for her attempts at snagging popularity with the school student body.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the premise for this is a unique one that shows some occasional wit as it believably portrays how a social outcast like Tomoko might perceive social situations based off any interest portraying a rather idealist take on reality (her dating sim games in this case) that isn't as what said interest perceives. On the other hand, the series lacks any gradual development in Tomoko's character as we don't know what led her to develop her present personality and habits, as well as any gradual changes to her character as she realizes the reality of the social situations she perceives. This does kill a bit of my interest in the title's premise as I would want to know more about Tomoko's character and see any gradual growth from her in order to better relate with her character. Instead we just see her mostly failing in her ventures and other than some occasions that hint to possible changes to come for Tomoko, there is very little for me to try caring for any possible chance at her changing for the better as the series seemed to delight more in tormenting her character.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series milks good use of its animation in depicting how flawed Tomoko's character is. Her character design is a unique one in that it isn't of the typical \"pretty girl\" variety seen from many recent titles as Tomoko is depicted with a frumpy and disheveled appearance, as well as show off some rather creepy and unsettling facial expressions depending on her emotional state. A number of visual gimmicks are portrayed to enhance major scenes depicting Tomoko's social isolation. While the series isn't on the visual scale of titles like Nagi no Asukara and Psycho-Pass that aired last year, it makes effective use of what it offers for its visual presentation and doesn't try going for elaborate animated sequences in its focus on Tomoko's isolation.\\n\\n\r\nWhile offering a unique premise for its comedy, Watamote suffers in the fact that it doesn't offer enough development in Tomoko's character to get the most potential out of its premise and for me to better relate to her character, instead seeming to relish in its torment of Tomoko for its comedy. Still, it would seem that there are those that like the unique direction of Watamote's comedy and have considered it one of 2013's top titles as a result of it. Baring this in mind, it seems the series is one of those \"your mileage may vary\" titles based on what you hope to get out of Watamote's premise.",

            "content": "Watamote, an anime put under the subcategory of \"humor\", may have accomplished that title. However, we all understand that it is so much more than that - it was written as a slice of life anime for all of the loners, wallflowers, awkward kids and general outcasts of the world. To anyone else, this anime would be quickly dismissed, and the main character would be seen as too artificial, unchanging and improbably far gone as a person. However, especially for the group it's trying to appeal to, it targets deep subconscious emotions and memories of our past and present, granting us with a powerful senseof catharsis. We feel her as a blurred reflection of ourselves when we stare into the mirror at our broken figures.\\n\\n\r\nAs a character, I would give her almost a perfect score for these reasons. However, as I stated, her inability to evolve and grow as a character makes the anime a little painful to watch. You sit there twiddling your thumbs, gripping your thigh, waiting for the sweet release of tension as Tomoko accomplishes feats or gets bits of luck. Don't hold your breath though, the manga is very similar to the anime in the sense of those characteristics. Personally, I am someone who enjoys watching animes that are unchanging and not very concerned about plots because they feel more authentic and realistic. As a slice of life anime, it achieved its sole purpose and recognizes that we, as people, take ages to evolve into anything besides what we are used to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style has some seriously unique traits - the characters that are irrelevant are typically given grey silhouettes as to divert focus away from them. Typically, it's done to classmates, but when Tomoko feels irrelevant, the shadow is passed onto her instead. One other interesting trait is how the characters are not always drawn with eyes, as to display how their individuality and uniqueness are severely limited - a trait that is seen as passed onto boring, superficial characters with no backstories.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Watamote is an anime that requires the individual watching it to fit their target audience, in order for one to enjoy it. Reasons being is that it lacks plot, does not evolve and is impossible to get through an episode without feeling vicarious embarrassment from her awkward encounters. On the other hand, the feeling of being able to sympathize with Tomoko provides a beautiful sense of catharsis. It is wonderfully written in the number of relatable situations they provide you with. It's a true story of fighting and willingness for achieving acceptance, but lets you down much as real life does. But perhaps Tomoko is not as unfortunate as she personally believes, as many characters will express interest in her when she does not notice. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime you must decide beforehand whether you fit the criteria of their target audience, because this is not an anime where ratings drift around the mean, but rather one where you either love it or you hate it. You'll either be sick of it by episode 3, or determined to keep coming back for more.",

The first time I heard about this anime, my friend told me to watch it so I did. I really love this anime a lot. It was amazing.\r\n~STORY~\r\nThe story isn't anything special. It's just about an otaku girl and her daily struggles. But what I liked from the story is that we can relate to the main character named Tomoko Kuroki. \r\n~ART/ANIMATION~\r\nThe art is really cute. I liked it. It was very colorful but sometimes it would get dark which wasbeautiful. The animation was smooth and adorable. Sometimes the animation would change into  different styles, which i liked because it made the animation more interesting.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nTHE OPENING SONG IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! I really loved the opening. My friend told me that the opening song was really good and now I agree with him. The Japanese voice acting is good. I like Tomoko's voice, it fits her very well. There was also one ending where there was a Hatsune Miku song and I was so happy. \\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\nThere are some characters that their names are never mentioned, but that wouldn't bother anyone. Tomoko is the main character and has a lot of struggles which makes a lot of us relate to her. I liked her personality and her character design. in character design, Tomoko would stand out a lot but yet again never get notice. There are only a few side characters, some of those don't have a big role considering that the anime was around Tomoko. The side characters have such a small role that you sometimes forget them. \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nOverall the small flaws in this anime I really enjoyed it. I really liked Tomoko and her younger brother Tomoki. The sound track was amazing and the animation was beautiful. I never have related to an anime character in my life until I met Tomoko.",

            "content": "Watamote, before anybody decides to watch this anime, there are some key points you have to understand, the whole 12 episodes are almost completly devoid of plot development, so the main enjoyment you may have from the anime is the comedy! But there is one aspect of it I didnt enjoyed much, it is a bit depressing, some may find it comical the whole time, and sure there were parts I had some laughs because of the whole sillyness of it... this show is something not everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. In the end I came with mixed feelings about it...\r\nThere isnt anygreat story surround it, you can almost see the anime has episodic stories of the misfortunes, negativity and delusions of Tomoko. The existent story is used as a suport for that and that alone! \\n\r\nSo dont come to expect any story worth watching here.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation/art it is what I came to expect of anime nowadays, goings complete by the standarts of the industry, thus it fullfiled the goal of being watchable, of demonstrating the viewer Tomoko day to life, not excelling at anything.\\n\\n\r\n\"The whole plot\" revolves around the MC Tomoko, being the rest, supportive cast, the main focus here will go to Tomoko, though I have to say some of the supportive cast has the potential to alone improve the series in the future by what I have seen at the end(will explain later on).\\n\r\nTomoko is a freshman on highshcool so you can expect to a certain degree of context stuff you have seen in other highschool's anime, here however, like I mentionated previously the nature of the athmosphere is far darker and much more delusional.\\n\r\nTomoko sees life and her surroundings in a very negative, depressive and delusional way, and that is where most of the comedy of the anime comes from, from all those weird actions and \"philosophys\" of Tomoko.\\n\r\nThough I had enjoyed the character, especially in the beggining, it got a bit depressing and boring at parts... I pitied her!! It is like I wanted someone to come to her, and slap her, make her awake up a bit at least. Support her, this doesnt happens for the most of it, DAMM!! \\n\r\nIt is like everyone around her is blind and cant see that path destrutive of hers, that she always keeps walking, and this is when you need people around you yo help you and give you a reality check!! \\n\r\nThis is the nature of the series, it is what it is, some may like it more than others, it is not of my personnal taste, that is for sure!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about Watamote is the sound. The OP and END, have some nice music and creativity to it, they capture well the anime, and in episode 12, I have to say I enjoyed alot how they kicked the OP near the it. \\n\r\nThe studio animating this, Silver Link, surely deserve praise, they were really creative and I cant see how they could hd improved more on this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nI was already on episode 4, and I was getting mixed feelings about the series (though I was laughing alot at first..), it is always the same, every episode expect some kind of negativity from Tomoko about a topic, and in the end she just gets things in the wrong way AGAIN, and for me that cames to be frustating!! I want her to at least learn something, I m not even asking for her  to be more popular at the end of it! But maybe, maybe at least she cames to realise it a bit, she is at fault by her thinking! She should try to improve, so she can start to have some more \"light\" into the \"sea of darkness of negativity she lives into\"... NOPE!! \\n\r\nShe ends just a tiny bit better than she began... Despite that, I had fun with the show, some of the negative stuff was soo wrong/weird, I found it really funny, and some stuff into this, already happened to anyone, so at least that is a connection the viewer can have with Tomoko! \\n\r\nAlso more to the end the series reveals more potential of how good could it be on the future, it is a shame it ended there!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, for me there is a good, and a bad way to enjoy this anime, it can be prettly enjoyable if you once in a while see 2-3 episodes, see the anime at the pace you feel you enjoy the most, no stress, or.... you marathoon IT!! \\n\r\nWhole animes I liked so much that could have watch whole hours of them in a day, for weeks without getting bored because the whole thing was interesting, and these were lengthy ones, not 12 episode's anime, that if you enjoy that most, you just get \"the job done\" in less than a day, if you have free time for it. \\n\r\nIf I had marathoon this, I would had been crazy be the end of it, with all the negativity! \\n\r\nNeedless to say I keep it safe, from time to time, I watched some of it, and it was possible to find enjoyment in all the \"weirdness and bad jokes\" of Tomoko!!\\n\r\nI understand well this is a satire, but it presents that kind of comedy I really dont enjoy that much, the plot can be shitty but if I can really enjoy the comedy, then it is fine by me. \\n\r\nFor this to get a better score, Tomoko would had to have more development, and the supportive cast should awake more to reality and see WTF is wrong with her!! (Deja vu!) One of my main complains, how the F#@5 dont they see she is in a destructive and misfortune behavior like that, even her's mother seems blind to it... anyway too biased, I know but it felt it could have been better, and with the little development at the end, the future looks promising to Tomoko! \\n\r\nSo before some people shit the anime, understand what it is, understand it is meaned to be like this be the author, and that is fine. Not everyone will enjoy it the most, but he can all voices our opinions, without insulting the work.\\n\\n\r\n7",

            "content": "\"..and her story that doesn\u2019t really matter\"\nThis quote taken directly from the end of the anime, sums up every problem I had with it. The story follows a 15 year old girl named Tomoko Kuroki, who spends too much time playing dating simulators and watching videos. As a result, she is an unsociable loner, and suffers from social anxiety. Though the plot seemed interesting at first, it rarely moved on, and when it did , it just followed the same premise over and over again, which was putting Tomoko in some sort of awkward or embarrassing situation. I didn\u2019t mind this repetitive formula at first,because the character and situations were very entertaining, for the most part, but then it just kept building and building until the very end which had no real payoff, as she never changes her ways.\\n\\n\nI believe this problem stems from the writers trying too hard to be unpredictable and un-cliche. All throughout the anime, the writers play with your expectations that come from other anime formulas and they decided that ending the show with a young girl trying to make the most of her adolescence by learning from the embarrassing events in her life was just too cliche.\\n\\n\nIf this is the case and the writers just truly wanted to stand out and be unique, then they could have ended it with something better than what we got. Because the ending we got was a teenager who blames all of her peers for her problems out of sheer jealousy, and will continue to do so, instead of learning from her mistakes and experiences. Sure, this ending isn\u2019t cliche, but that\u2019s because it isn\u2019t interesting and doesn\u2019t give any sense of closure. The only explanation that would make sense of all of this would be if the ending was setting up for a season 2. Even then, it\u2019d still be pretty bad.\\n\\n\nEvery embarrassing event Tomoko went through left me with this expectation of her to learn something from them. When I finally reached the end, all I got was disappointment that I could have literally skipped episodes 2-11 without missing anything other than a few humorous scenes. And that\u2019s another thing. The comedy in this anime is really awkward. And when I mean really awkward, I mean REALLY awkward. Sure, I laughed at it, but for the wrong reasons. I laughed only to try to make myself feel more comfortable with the awkward situation because if I didn\u2019t it would just be flat out sad and torturous.\\n\\n\nThe art and sound were good for the most part. I think appropriate would be a better word, as most of the time the music and art style just matched the tone of a scene, instead of being pleasant. I\u2019ll admit I found it really hilarious when the music would match Tomoko\u2019s mood and would go from sounding pleasant, to going off pitch and sounding horrible.\\n\\n\nThroughout the anime Tomoko goes from an interesting character with a lot of potential, to an unlikable disaster. I think she was written with the intent to be relatable to, as we\u2019ve all had our insecurities and embarrassing/awkward stages in our lives; this is what makes the anime funny. The writers seem to be pushing the viewers to try to sympathize with Tomoko, for instance, the scene where she sits and eats alone. The truth is, we all hated this part of our lives and we knew we were being unreasonable by blaming everyone else but ourselves, and not even attempting to make friends or talk to others.\\n\\n\nThis is where the issue of Tomoko never changing or maturing really comes into play. Halfway through the show, her thoughts just begin to sound like childish whining and complaining. Why should we sympathize with her if she isn\u2019t willing to change or grow up? Where is the lesson to be learned from all of this? That it\u2019s okay to be unreasonable? The lesson is so unclear, that I decided that there just never was one to begin with.\\n\\n\nThat being said I believe this anime could be enjoyed if watched with a different perspective than that of other shows. The serious lack of story progression and character development seems to follow the same formula for a comedy or sitcom where funny things happen, but the plot never really progresses at all. If watched from this perspective I believe that are some genuinely funny moments that we could relate to and laugh at.\\n\\n\nTo sum it all up, I was never really \u201cbored\u201d, while watching this anime because it always had situational humor. However, the same could be said about any junky cartoon show or comedy. Unfortunately, I look for more when I watch anime, and this barely average one continues to leave me disappointed and unsatisfied.\\n\\n\nAnd remember..\\n\\n\n\"Seriously, it doesn\u2019t even matter\"",

But I believe it's what makes the main character so interesting.

Somehow, I could understand how she felt and why she was trying to hard.\\n\\n\r\nWatamote is a wonderfull depiction (more like a caricature) of the pressure teenagers (with mental issues) live in highschool.

Each story starts out rather the same our lead reads or views an online forum, which states some type of social fad, that Tomoko follows. The specific fad backfires and doesn\u2019t go as planned. There\u2019s usually a certain part in the middle where Tomoko starts coming to a realization that the social fad isn't working. Somewhere in middle or end of each episode her brother pops out of no where and stays, long enough to throw one of his witty criticisms. And atthe end we see the social fad doesn\u2019t work. Rinse and repeat this over and over again each episode.The Formulated plots starts over again and soon becomes boring.The Overblown exaggerated comedy becomes repetitive rather quickly. This is a comedy oriented anime, however that doesn\u2019t excuse it for it bland repetitive story and character development Whereas Welcome to the NHK and Princess Jellyfish succeeded, Watamote fails. The story never progresses at all. There is no variety and no plot to keep you interested for more than a couple of episodes. In addition she repeats the same jokes again and again without changing their methods, which eventually becomes tiresome. Tomoko never tries to overcome her reclusive behavior. This story follows the same pattern, and never steps out of it boundary to achieve anything new.\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nThe Voice Acting was average, at a little times overdone, but it fit the overall series well.\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe production values are fine for this sort of show.

            "content": "WATAMOTE is fundamentally a story about social anxiety and loneliness. For some viewers, this will be a frustrating show with almost no relatable elements. However, others will find this show resonates with their life experience and for a select few it might even be a revelatory insight into their own lives. The category that you fall into will determine how you feel about this show. People in the latter group will almost assuredly derive some pleasure (if only schadenfreude) from the show, but those in the former group may be put off by the frustration of what they are watching (some might find comedic valuein the show though).\\n\\n\r\nWATAMOTE's biggest weakness for me was the plot/story. It takes until the very end of the final episode for Tomoko to come to any substantial revelation about herself. Maybe I had unrealistic expectations based on previous anime tropes and stories. I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but if you expect or need significant character and/or story arcs this won't be the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhat WATAMOTE does right is the art and sound, which both perfectly fit the emotions and tone of the show. Both the art and sound help to reinforce Tomoko's personality and mood and add some much needed variety to each episode. Because explaining further would actually be spoilers to some of the best parts of the show, I'll leave it at that. Needless to say, you should enjoy the art and sound, I found them very polished as you would expect from a major studio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this a 7/10 because the story was weak (and the show left me wanting), but the rest was very well executed. I enjoyed the series and was able to relate to Tomoko, but I really wanted to see something significant happen to her. If I had been thrown a bone and Tomoko had actually changed in some significant way, this show would easily have been an 8 or 9. Even so, I still recommend this show to fans of slice of life series. It's still an enjoyable ride.",

            "content": "Watamote is one of the most unique, down-to-earth, in-your-face anime series that I've ever watched (albeit slightly exaggerated). I don't think you can find another equivalent series anywhere. (If there is, please tell me!) This series can be renamed \"Tomoko and her series of unfortunate events\". It seems like the whole world is against her in every corner that she turns. In other words, nothing seems to go well, ever. Although I was glad that there seemed to be a glimmer of light for her nearing the end of the series. \r\nCharacter: The first thing that attracted me to this series (and kept me watching)was Tomoko. Although my own experiences may not be as dramatic, I found myself relating to her circumstances and empathising with her as she struggled through life. There are times when I hated having to form groups because I felt I never belonged anywhere. There are times when you see your friends developing and progressing at a rapid pace, leaving you behind in the dust. I love the peace of being alone, having my own me-time, but at the same time I worry that I'm wasting my life away and will continue to be forever alone. \\n\r\nAnother character that I really liked was Tomoki. Or rather, I really liked the interactions between Tomoko and Tomoki. It's so cute how they look like each other (the eye bags thing must be genetic). I just don't understand why Tomoki never gave his sister any advice as he watched her ruin her own life. \\n\\n\r\nStory: This anime is one of a kind. I appreciated how Tomoko never really escaped from her plight because in reality it's just not that easy. I watched animes in which the female protagonist is plain, unsociable and awkward but a guy loves her for some reason. Because of that she blossoms into something beautiful. That is an enviable case which I really hope would happen in reality, but things don't always work out that way. But I'm glad that Tomoko has one true friend in her life that truly cared for her and stuck with her no matter how weird her friend was. Sometimes we don't need many friends in life, we just need those few authentic gems who we find along our journey. I kind of wish her friend or brother or mother or SOMEBODY just told Tomoko the truth and guided her out of her doldrums. But then again, in a culture of politeness, criticism may not be as easy or natural. It reminded me that sometimes the people who say the cruel, cold, hard truth may really be the kindest of all. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: I absolutely love the ending song. Kudos to Izumi Kitta for sounding like the most sloppy, drunk, crazy, messed up, psychotic girl ever. This is one out-of-tune song that's on the top of my songlist. Why? Because Tomoko's character shines from this song. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: I'm not sadistic enough to say I enjoyed seeing Tomoko suffer, but I really liked the comedy behind the show and her very interesting thought process. That also made me realise that sometimes the way we view ourselves and the world around us can be really really wrong and we don't even realise it. \\n\r\nSo what exactly makes a person popular? I think the answer was subtly revealed later on in the series. When a person takes her own gaze away from herself and genuinely cares & serves others.

            "content": "Watamote is a very strange, darkly comical, and deep story. The manga, being compared to the anime, is classified mostly as comedy revolving around a lonely life, while the anime actually dives into the very real depression of exactly that. This anime is seen as extremely saddening, yet relatable to some, but heartwarming or comedic to others. Trying to be an optimist, I see it the second way. It's pretty uncommon when anime makes me laugh, but this one had me rolling. The comedic aspect of this also refers to the first way people see it, aka the relatability. I was laughing because Tomoko wasso relatable, her problems were extremely embarrassing, and having been through some of them myself the redness in my face was starting to grow from both laughing and embarrassment. But, even though this anime started out a comical comic, it turned into something dark, yet lesson teaching.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all the terrible situations Tomoko has been through, one episode *cough* (Spoiler Alert) Episode 11 *cough* really showed that someone actually acknowledged Tomoko, and uses the age-old reassurer \"Someone out there likes you\" in a very heartwarming, beautiful, and tear-jerking way. Though the downfall of this anime was that it didn't have a second season to build on that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, hope I did well!",

Especially in our formative years. We all want to be characters like in our favorite shows, movies, or video games. But in reality, we are all a lot more like Tomoko.

In the beginning of the show she resolves to change her lonely life and decides to try and make friends and become a popular girl. This, however, is easier said than done. \r\n  Tomoko is an extremely socially awkward girl and this usually gets in the way ofher trying to make friends, or even say hello to another person. The story is basically all of her failed attempts at making friends and becoming a popular girl. Her bizarre schemes to become popular usually backfire and make her worse off than before. Throughout the show Tomoko is the only character to receive any characterization. The show mainly focuses on her and her plight. \\n\r\nThe music, especially the opening theme were great to me. The opening theme was a great auditory presentation of Tomoko's thoughts and emotions.\\n\r\nOverall I thoroughly enjoyed Watamote. It is certainly cringe worthy, but, it is full of comedy that followers of the medium will enjoy. The story is very easy to relate to, whether you have no friends or find yourself feeling lonely time to time; it has something in it for everyone. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys an absurd, embarrassing comedy.",

I don\u2019t really trust people like that. \r\nI think good people understand their inner dirtbag.  Watamote is a test, developed by Silver Link Studios\u2014a test to see who can really tune in to the higher levels of reality. \r\nThe kind of person who hates this program is the sort of person who cannot face their own short-comings. \r\nI am one of the realest people on the planet; so, it\u2019s no wonder that I loved this showand totally identified with the main character.  I empathized with her agony and frustrating anxiety. Watamote\u2019s immersion in frustration felt like a nail file being raked again my gums and I could not get enough.  As the heroine descended further into despair I sat titillated, hoping for her to fail harder and harder.  Mind you, this was not out of hatred for the character; it was out the excitement for seeing how far Japanese television could push the limits of true humanity.  \\n\\n\r\nSometimes there were episodes where I fell into the trap of wanting Kuroki to make a friend before she ultimately failed. I was never disappointed though.  I knew that as long as she remained alone, the show could go on and so could my joy.  A happy episode would ruin everything. It would ruin Kuroki-chan\u2019s beauty. That is why it cannot be. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, nobody bought the DVD\u2019s and we will never see a program this great ever again. There is just no room in the market for incest free motion pictures these days. To make up for that void, I\u2019ve opted for repeat viewings.  This might be the first anime I ever watch from beginning to end twice in the same week. \\n\\n\r\nI did have to deduct a point for a whole episode surrounding rape/sexual assault jokes.  Where I come from, that\u2019s just not cool no more.  A perfect 10/10 ruined by left wing fanaticism. Thanks Obama. \\n",

I found this anime an amazing piece of work due to how the feelings of the main protagonist backfires onto the viewer, leaving them embarrassed and pity not themselves, but about the protagonist. It's done a good job at doing that. Besides that, Watamote is extremely hilarious, being a comedy anime. I feel kind of rude since I don't laugh exactly with the main protagonist but 'at' her. I thought the art could have been bettersince in my own opinion, the main protagonist should have been a tad more uglier. Though I found the appearance of her uniform worn really suits her character. Speaking of character, I believe each person especially the main protagonist played their character or personality very nicely. I love how the main protagonist is extremely serious on trying to become more attractive and popular but never succeeded. The way she tries to socialize with others besides her family makes me want fall off my chair and earn a 6 pack from laughing too hard. I'm probably typing a lot more on the main protagonist but that's mainly because the whole entire anime is pretty much her miserable life.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Watamote as it gives a huge smile in the face for not being her(no offense to those who can relate to the main protagonist).",

            "content": "As you may notice, I have not watched all of Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (Or as the sane call it, Watamote)- and that is simply because it is the most hard to watch anime out there. I have seen brutal horror animes and read Punpun just to name a few close comparisons in hard to finish, but in the end I honestly can say that Watamote is an anime that I can just not complete under any sane circumstance and I congratulate people who have gotten through the whole thing. But this is not because of what is putinto the show is bad, but rather.... Well, It's better to leave it to it's own section at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to get the criteria I usually save until the end out of the way so I can talk about what makes this show so unbearable to watch in the \"Enjoyment\" section:\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6 \\n\r\nWatamote has some sort of progression, a slow introduction of a gradual cast of characters, plot points in each episode that are coherent- but it doesn't seem to ever want to go anywhere. I suppose this is normal for \"Slice of Life\" animes, but Watamote seems stubborn in keeping you in one place. Each episode seems to drag on for eternity, to the point where it almost feels real time from day to night- and not in the show's favour.\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nThe first I was introduced to this anime besides from a basic outline of the plot was the opening- and wow, it caught my eye. It's art style is stylized enough to stand way out from the crowd, yet firm enough to remain easy to look at and not a strain on the eyes. However, once the actual anime starts, it begins to show it's seams and laziness once in a while. But overall, the artstyle is very pleasant to look at- and while the opening is definitely the best animation you'll be seeing on the show, the rest isn't exactly a tax on the overall quality of the show.\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nProbably the best part of the anime. Watamote isn't afraid of going all over the place with it's soundtrack- from the extremely unfitting metal/hard rock roots that are still absolutely amazing to listen to, to probably the only Hatsune Miku song I really like, to upbeat pop and sometimes jazz. Some music and ambience even seems like it's fitting in a more horror based anime- I just love the way Watamote isn't afraid to just experiment with it's soundtrack and not have one distinct style. (Almost) every track is a pleasure to listen to, and the ones that aren't are either joke tracks or play for a brief duration in the show. I'd highly recommend a skimming through the OST.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also good too, and fitting to the characters they play. They express a lot of emotion and feeling just through voice sometimes. (English Subtitles/Japanese Voiceover)\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4\\n\r\nEvery character is a stereotype. In short, this is fitting based on the fact that this anime is sort of a \"lens\" into how the main character views the world, but it really just ends up feeling lazy and generic as each character shows up and you see the extent of their one dimension within 5 minutes. A small girl is cute but observant, Tomoko's friend is hot and popular but used to be nerdy, etc etc. It feels like it was done in a total of 5 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe one exception is Tomoko. While I do not like her character that much personally, I appreciate the depth and thoroughness they put into the character. She is expressive, and a lot of her feelings are relatable to some points in our lives.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 2\\n\r\nAnd here we go. If you don't already know based on the plot of this show (and my apologies for not briefly explaining it earlier, I wanted to keep you in some sort of suspense!), Watamote is about a socially awkward teenager and her escapades of never getting a lucky break. It's the equivalent of going on youtube and searching up cringeworthy videos- however it's even harder and less enjoyable to watch than that because it's an anime that was made specifically to pander to an audience who wants to watch this, and because of that, is constantly trying to push your buttons and force second hand embarrassment. Tomoko cheats at a card tournament for elementary school kids despite being in highschool, gets caught unknowingly by her parents listening to audioporn with a \"back massager\", and frequently ignores personal hygiene and all effort to keep herself together- all while asking the world why she isn't popular. And while it is true that we sometimes miss the obvious and look past basic things that cast us in a negative light, Watamote will purposefully amp it up to 10 and make you bite your nails down to the core while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is some truth to a few of the things Tomoko does. While a lot of the experiences she goes through panders only to a small group of extremely socially awkward people, there was a few relatable moments where her introversion caused more harm than good (My favourite is when she mentally maps a floor plan and potential actions of people around her just so she can avoid bumping into people she knows at mcdonalds).\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, I have to say that Watamote is probably the least enjoyable anime I've watched. It makes my whole body tingle unpleasantly and curl up as Tomoko spends a large amount of an episode arguing uselessly with people on the anime's equivalent of 2chan, looking through binoculars to spy on undressing women with middle schoolers, and jokingly hitting on her (comparatively) normal brother to the point of implying incest as the joke flies way over his head.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6 \\n\r\nA few of my friends who have also watched the show all have different interpretations of it- Some say it is a in depth study of social awkwardness, some say it's just a comedy, and some say it shouldn't even be viewed as funny. But I say no matter what it is, it's a pain to watch. It's not the art that makes it bad, it's not the sound that makes it bad, sometimes it's not even the characters that make it bad. It's the pure essence of cringe and second hand embarrassment that makes me not recommend this show to anyone who wants something that isn't spine tingling and hard to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people probably do, but I don't watch anime because I want to be forced to look away from the screen because my body is tensing up so hard from watching a socially awkward character fail miserably at something. I had a hard enough time with that in highschool.",

What I love more than anything is that they didn't make the main character this overly attractive or overly cute girl (at first) she seemed so normal in that sense and the artthe used really put emphasis on that. This is a slice of life show but compared to other slice of life anime its a hit. You'll always be laughing, you'll be in shock of how much the characters life reflects or has similarities to your own. It's an easy character to get attached too. The ending is also not that bad either. NO INCEST =DDDD yes she has a brother and no they don't start a relationship. THANK CHRIST. Every other anime out there is really incest heavy right now Yes I'm looking at you Oreimo (my little sister can't be this cute)!

I really enjoyed the music throughout the anime, even the OP+ED songs. Not to mention it's really lewd and it has a lot of good humorous moments to give you a break from the sadness. The art's really good in my opinion, andthe sound was fantastic. I also love the voice actor, (she also sings the ending song, which is AWESOME.) and overall it's just a well made relateable-albeit a trivial one- story of a girls high school life.

            "content": "This series doesn't really follow a story arc, but unlike other series where it kind of works, it actually hinders the quality of an otherwise interesting story. \r\nIt's about a girl called Tomoko who just cannot seem to catch a break. She had high expectations for her first year of high school, but things do not seem to go as planned. She has trouble to talking to people and is also generally ignored by the populace. Whenever someone does try to talk to her, outside of her immediate family, she gets incredibly nervous and shy. The show revolves around her attempts to increase her popularityat High School so she can meet new friends, get a boyfriend, and enjoy her High School years. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this may sound like an interesting underdog story, it has quite a few downsides. \\n\\n\r\nTomoko receives little character development in this character story. She becomes less nervous talking to people, and gains a little confidence, but never actually develops in a meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nHer character and her goals also are a little inconsistent. In the first half of the story (Roughly episodes 1-7), one of her primary goals is to get guys to notice and/or like her. It makes sense since her character is written to be extremely sexualized, with even a fantasy scene in one of the first few episodes of her being gang-raped. However, after the 7th episode, she seems to be more interested in getting the attention of girls and even comes across as a bit of a lesbian. This comes out of nowhere and seems kind of odd.\\n\\n\r\n She also seems to be disinterested in getting a boyfriend and more interested in just finding friends but in the first half of the series, she liked being alone generally but was really looking to find a guy. Yeah sure, she always wanted attention, but seemed to have switched from primarily male to primarily female towards the second part of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story was deliberately written in the way of not having plot progression. There were many chances for the writer to take the story down an interesting path, only to have it dropped or ruined by the main character who pushes the bounds of suspension of disbelief. The story has no ending, despite building up to one, and the only closure the series has is a vague \"Who cares, be happy with yourself.\" \\n\\n\r\nI held Tomoko in various states of like and dislike depending upon her actions, situation, and setting. She is a sympathetic character, someone who we've all been to some extent and someone who we'd all want to help. She also can be selfish, mean and weird. However, I believe the audience wanted to see her ultimately succeed and towards the end, it seems that she might get what she actually wants. The opportunity for a happy ending is ruined by, in my opinion, a poorly taught lesson used as an excuse to show some panties and jiggling breasts. \\n\\n\r\nSaying all I have said, the writer is  skilled at writing characters, and the support characters are surprisingly normal when compared to Tomoko and that was a great juxtaposition. The story is well connected, with characters coming back in later episodes, and the episode ideas were interesting enough that it was a hard series to put down. Tomoko is sympathetic, her brother is a realistic example of a sibling, her middle school friend was genuine and at the end, it seems someone actually notices her. It played out fairly realistically and if it wasn't for the writer snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, it would have been a satisfying tale. However it didn't, so it's just an okay series. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't watched anime at all though. There was fair too many anime culture references, specifically from the Haruhi series. I noticed an Another reference as well. I probably didn't get all the references myself, so it's probably a series best left to watching later. I think people who have watched more anime than myself might have found find it funnier. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am giving it a 6. If this series had followed a more stereotypical story arc within it's context, it could have been great. But changing the character, goal, and completely messing up the ending makes it just another average anime.",

(yeah, I typed that. No google.), Watamote... a show that has the same premise that people with same \u201cillness\u201d are supposed to relate to. Well, atleast that\u2019s what the show intended to do\u2026 on paper.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nNow, forgive me when I say this but this show\u2026 is shit. That\u2019s your cue to get the fuck out if you\u2019re one of the few people who liked this series. I don\u2019t know why people love this show so much when it came out. This show was made not for people with social anxieties to relate with but this show is rather made in order to make fun of them. People go \u201cOh, I know what it feels to be in this situation. I feel for her.\u201d but at the end of the day, let\u2019s be honest, all the situations she\u2019s been through is created for comedic reasons. I have a hunch that the author of the manga is one of the \u201cpopular ones\u201d that knows someone like Tomoko and goes something like \u201cHah! This human\u2019s situation is ridiculously amusing, I should make a manga even if my drawings are as bad as her situations so I can sell it and make some quick buck.\u201d. I\u2019d like to say that the series HAD potential after the first episode but rather than improving her situation, nothing changes apart from her situation getting worse every episode. To quote Alain from Bakashift, \u201cthe entire series is the first episode 12 times\u201d. This is a review of the anime but from what I\u2019ve seen in the manga, nothing has changed. There\u2019s a scene in the manga where she was participating in a marathon then she suddenly felt an urge to shit. What did she do? She knocked on the door of a total stranger and asked the homeowner if she can use their bathroom\u2026 *sigh*. That\u2019s the last chapter I\u2019ve seen and decided to never again touch that abomination. Let\u2019s just make one thing clear\u2026 I\u2019m not offended on how the series made fun of my previous/semi-present situation. I don\u2019t take any show to a personal level (except ef: melodies & oregairu) so don\u2019t start pointing fingers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in this series is more interesting than the main character. See, their personalities are so colorful and interesting that sometimes I wonder what will happen if they\u2019re taken out of the series to be moved to a completely different show as the main character. I can surely watch that show and probably not be pissed about it. In the topic of moving characters from this series to another, I wonder what\u2019ll happen if I move Tomoko and put her in a series like Berserk, Deadman Wonderland, or High School of The Dead/Gyo? I just want to see her get killed miserably and have a good laugh so forgive me. Hmm\u2026 Now, for the sake of my reviewing format, let\u2019s talk about the \u201cmain character\u201d Kuroki Tomoko.\\n\\n\r\n\tSee, I can understand her situation if she got bullied or something but no such thing was mentioned in the series or in the manga from what I\u2019ve read. Why is she such a despicable tiny little shit? No one in the series (except her younger brother) talks badly about her yet she treats everybody like they\u2019re trash. Maybe, just maybe, this is her way to hide her inferiority complex but still\u2026 why? Also, she calls her best friend, the ONLY ONE person that she can portray herself as herself a bitch? You know as an atheist, I don\u2019t believe in hell but let me just say that there\u2019s a special place in hell for people like her. I really don\u2019t think she has any redeemable traits. Wait, let\u2019s be fair, I\u2019ll think about it for a minute\u2026 just a minute\u2026 Hmmm\u2026 She\u2019s a liar, she cheats to beat kids in card games, she searches pictures of penises on her phone during class, she badmouths everybody\u2026 nah, nothing. I hate her, that\u2019s that. If you count that as a \u201credeemable trait\u201d then by all means do so.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nSilver Link\u2026 What are the other shows they\u2019ve made? *searches google*. Baka and Test/Akiyuki Shinbo Jr. directs a show outside Shaft, Kokoro Connect/Four kids exchange bodies while Inaba remains best girl, and this season\u2019s (Fall 2015) \u201cThe Worst One\u201d and The 35th Anti-Magic Platoon. Well, the studio\u2019s not really \u201cup-there\u201d by a long shot by they have their merits. In Watamote, the character designs don\u2019t really appeal to my taste but at least it\u2019s better than what is on the manga. It\u2019s pretty normal with some amazing utilization of angles. There are some scenes where everything goes landscape mode and that was amazing. Apart from that, nothing else. I really have nothing cool to say about the animation section because it\u2019s pretty much average with not much about it standing out.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nApart from the OP and the Natsu Matsuri ED, I find everything about this soundtrack forgettable. Like in the animation section, everything when it comes to music, at least from my perspective, is pretty standard. Nothing much stood out and it was probably happy to be at least forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nNow, disregarding that fact, let\u2019s talk about the dub. Monica Rial as Tomoko\u2026 is fucking amazing. When I first heard that Monica Rial was playing as Tomoko I went \u201cfucking nailed it!\u201d. See, I hate, I despise, I LOATHE Monica Rial like you can\u2019t even imagine. But that fact aside, I also know her potentials\u2026 well, if you can really call it \u201cpotential\u201d. I know what her voice is capable of. And when I finally got the chance to re-watch it dubbed, my expectations were not betrayed. She sounds fucking awesome as Tomoko. How can I put this if you haven\u2019t seen the dub and just refuse to? Hmm.. Let\u2019s just say Tomoko\u2019s seiyuu is capable of speaking fluently in English. There, the best example I can think of. Monica Rial and Tomoko\u2019s seiyuu sounds like one person to be honest. Re-watching Watamote was a pain but since Monica Rial finally finds a role that she\u2019s 100% compatible with, it became a bit bearable. I finished re-watching it not because I liked it but because I was deeply moved by Monica Rial\u2019s performance which is coming from a hater, is probably a good thing, right?\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nI never really wanted to review this series but I found myself having too much to say about this series when I was looking for something to review. This series is one of the few series out there where I question myself as to why it even exists. Apparently, it was popular in 4chan but popularity is pretty subjective in my eyes. The producers were like \u201cOh\u2026 this manga is popular overseas! Let\u2019s make it an anime so we can sell it abroad for a couple of bucks.\u201d Well, I think they\u2019ve succeeded in doing so. Now, can we stop it at that? I heard there is an ongoing petition in the internet to make another season of this series. People, if you\u2019ve indeed signed this petition, please tell me your name and where you live so I can shake your hand personally\u2026 and burn your house.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, I\u2019ll (not) gladly give Watamote an overall score of 4.88 out of 10. I seriously wanted to give it a lower score but since I follow my own formula when it comes to scoring, the score was somehow pulled by the animation and sounds section. I may have talked about how shit this entire series is throughout my show but it\u2019s really not as bad as I claim it to be. Maybe it just rubs me the wrong way and didn\u2019t laugh as much as a chuckle while watching it but who knows? You might like it if your tickle bone is softer than mine. Well, that\u2019s your decision. Try not to use my review as an excuse to not watch it. I still recommend the series, though I don\u2019t want to, if you want to laugh at other\u2019s misfortunes. That\u2019s your call.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\nFor alternate recommendation, why don\u2019t you try My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu (I recently found out that snafu was in fact a word. I was surprised to be honest)? A series that has the same premise: a loner trying to fit in society, or rather in school. But in Snafu\u2019s case, Hachiman, the protagonist is the textbook example of how loners should act (though he crosses the line sometimes). I\u2019ve said before that I consider Hachiman as the torchbearer of loners worldwide and I still believe that fact.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you don\u2019t want that, there\u2019s always Welcome to The NHK. A show that Watamote should have been but never did. That\u2019s all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for reading again as always. Bye!\\n",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nThis story is a unique one, to say the least. It's realistic, and while it's almost too painfully relatable to the common unpopular girl, it's funny and fastpaced and is hardly ever boring.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe character designs are somewhat simplistic, but the animation flows well and has a clear style to it - one that goes well with the story. I liked Tomoko's design a lot - it was cute, but not in a typical way. The backgrounds didn't stand out all that much, but they weren't bad.\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nI hated the theme song - I skipped it every time. It's loud, screamo stuff reminiscent ofthe second Death Note OP. I don't know if it's meant to be ironic or not, but it's horrible either way. I didn't mind the regular background music, but it didn't stand out as incredible or anything. The ending OP is cute, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKoroki Tomoko is one of my favourite characters in existence - she's awkward, she's weirdly cute, she's shy, she's nervous, she's real. Since I'm autistic, she's relatable to me in that aspect (even though she isn't stated to have autism, more like severe social anxiety). She gives off a lot of secondhand embarrassment, but she's someone that you root for throughout the series nevertheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters besides Tomoko are more regular, but they're not bad. Yuu-chan, her friend, is fairly cute, and Tomoko's brother is likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like stories in which the underdog rises to the top, this one is unfortunately not for you. It's enjoyable to watch in that it has a good plot and interesting scenarios, but it's horribly uncomfortable and at times a little disheartening. I would've liked to see Tomoko achieve some level of happiness, but she really doesn't go through much change throughout the series, which is disappointing to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile Watamote has a lot of flaws, it is overall a good, relatable show. It's short and sweet and unique. I would recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui is, for the most part, one of the most realistic anime I've ever watched.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThere really isn't all that much of a story to be had in this anime, but it's good for what it's worth. We follow Kuroki Tomoko, a 15 year-old shut-in who is entering her first year of high school and makes it her master plan to become popular and enjoy her high school life surrounded by friends and admirers... Needless to say, absolutely nothing goes her way, and Tomoko oftentimes unintentionally puts herself into some of the most painfully embarrassingsituations I've witnessed in a piece of entertainment, and these situations are the only real downside to this anime. I found a select few to be amusing, but the majority of these embarrassments made me feel quite uncomfortable. Where I found the story shined instead were the moments where Tomoko was alone to her thoughts. The viewers really get a feeling for how she thinks and operates, which works very well in an anime in which we're pretty much following a single character throughout the whole thing. WataMote also seems to really enjoy getting our hopes up for something to finally go Tomoko's way, only to flip that hope completely on its head as if it were mocking us for wanting her to magically have something work out for her, because folks, let me tell ya; that ain't how things work in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art-style to WataMote. Two highlights to point out are Tomoko's character design and the lighting. Tomoko's design stuck out to me because we aren't often given a character who looks visibly downtrodden and disheveled 95% of their time on screen. This adds a lot to the realism of her character. The lighting also caught my interest because it isn't something normally done. Usually, in other anime, scenes are lit quite smoothly. However, in WataMote, sources of light produce shapes of color that give the aesthetic of the anime a lot of character.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nI love the opening and main ending theme! Both of them feel very unique in their own regards. The opening, for example, both fits the show perfectly and doesn't fit it at all at the same time. On one hard, it is an exposition of Tomoko's inner frustration and anger towards the world. On the other hand, metal isn't exactly a style of music you'd typically associate with a comedy about a 15 year old girl. And the ending theme fits the show and stands out in that it sounds very cute and upbeat, while at the same time containing intentionally off-key vocals that sound almost frantic and hysterical at times, even throwing in the sound of the singer pretending to vomit. As for the background music for the rest of the show? It was nice and fit the scenes they were meant to fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nAside from Tomoko, not many of the characters stood out to me too much. Which I suppose is completely fine, seeing as how it is a show almost exclusively about Tomoko. Speaking of Tomoko, let's talk about her. She is a lonely, depressed girl who wants nothing more than to have some friends. Sure, she has Yuu-chan, her sole friend from middle school, but we don't get to see too much of her seeing as how she goes to a different school and isn't always able to find the time to hang out with Tomoko. I know a lot of people have said that Tomoko is \"the most relatable character in anime\", but I do have to agree on that. A lot of people who watch anime (myself included) have eerily similar thoughts and fantasies to Tomoko. We aren't always too fond of living in the real world, not all of us have very many people who we can say we love and enjoy spending time with, we judge outgoing and think of numerous reasons as to why they're the scum of the earth, etc. etc.. I did really like Tomoko's little cousin Kii-chan who comes to realize that Tomoko is just a lonely girl looking for affection (which seems almost ludicrously wise coming from a 12 year-old), and Imae-san, an older girl who attends the same school as Tomoko who takes notice to how hard she tries to find happiness and attempts to help her. All in all, I enjoyed Watamote's characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nAside from the cringe-fest scenes that I mentioned earlier, I found my self quite enjoying WataMote. It may not be anything mindblowing or exciting or hilarious, but you'll find a nice mixed bag of comical, touching, and slightly emotional and/or depressing scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nAs I sit here alone on a Saturday night typing this review in a dark room with my face lit only by my computer screen, I'm chuckling to myself at how similar this situation seems to so many scenes in WataMote. I agree: most relatable anime ever created. And a pretty darn good one to boot.",

            "content": "So, it seems to me that this is the type of anime that you may love or hate depending on your ability to relate to the main character's problems. Our main protagonist is a young girl named Tomoko who suffers from very severe social anxiety. The plot revolves around all of her attempts (and usually failures) to make friends in school and get people to notice her.\r\nDuring the first couple of episodes I laughed my head off, and yet couldn't decide whether or not I was actually supposed to be laughing. In truth, while a very comedic show with hilariously awkward moments, Watamote is sotragic. And I guess the reason I decided it was okay to laugh was because I can relate to Tomoko on so many levels: how she struggles to talk to strangers and hold a conversation, how she overanalyzes situations and what people will think, how much more comfortable she is on her own than with other people, yet she still gets lonely... I totally get it. The only difference is, I've always had a loving support system, while Tomoko is mostly on her own to come up with crazy, messed up ideas in her head of how to get popular. But I knew where she was coming from, and therefore I could laugh while still rooting for her and hoping just maybe something good would happen to her in the next episode. Luckily, a few times the writers gave us a treat and I felt myself welling up with tears when I saw Tomoko successfully talk to someone or get treated with kindness.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, while fitting in my opinion, certainly wasn't what I wished it could be. Yet, I suppose that's what makes it kind of realistic. My only hope is that eventually she'll come out of her shell a little and make some new friends. Maybe I'll have to read the manga sometime :)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I thought this was an excellent anime, albeit not for everyone. To me, it was clever how the writer made the series into a comedy without toning down or truly making light of the struggles associated with social anxiety. Really a lot of fun to watch.",

Welcome to the same scenario as Watamote.\r\n~PLOT~\r\nBeing that this is a slice of life show there is no real plot. Girl is unpopular, trys to do something to stand out, fails, repeat. I personally have no issues with this, It's just that you can see the problem or the fail before it even starts. I also like how the show makes parody scenes from diffrent anime such as death note, evalengelion, and others that I haven't seen yet because I'm lazy.\r\n~Characters~\r\nTheres actually only 3 characters thateven play a part in this show\\n\r\nTomoko - A very shy 1st year high school girl that is trying to make friends and be popular.\\n\r\nTomoki - Her younger brother and the complete opposite of tomoko. He's actually more of the asshole character but I understand his view since I have siblings of my own.\\n\r\nYuu - Tomokos only friend. she comes and goes like every character so theres not much to say about her.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound and Animation~\\n\r\nLet me sum this up and say this \" dat opening.\" This is both the best animation and the best track in the whole show. The animation only shines in the times they make parody refrences to diffrent shows, but thats it. The sound and animation any other time are basic. The dub isn't bad either but I have not watched the sub. The dub is satisfying enough to watch and leave it as is, but it's odd and Has it's moments.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL~\\n\r\nWatamote defiantly had potential in the first few episodes but slowly died down and got old later in the show. Everything just got old. I did enjoy the show however and it is a nice change to what I was watching. The show however Just didnt amuse me As I thought it would. I don't hate it, but I'm not a fan. The only other thing about this show I didn't like was the ending, do you know why? there wasn't one. The show just ends with no progress to her. It isnt like an elfen lied/ deadman wonderland end with plot holes the size of the fucking sun. But the show never wraps things up completely. Enough to keep you satisfyed, but they left it open enough that they look like they wanted to make a sequal. \\n\\n\r\nRating - 6",

A somewhat relate-able character type that you do not see in other shows and (as others have mentioned) a slightly darker, almost painful to watch style of humour that had me in stitches.\r\nAlthough I feel like this is another \"love it or hate it\" show it is short and well worth giving it a try, you won't know until you try it yourself! It's only shortfalls for me were the story and art style which, while good, seemed to be lackinga bit.\\n\\n\r\n9 - Awesome, I just wish there was more.",

            "content": "WataMote is a peculiar show, in an almost literal sense. It was a genuinely strange series,with a nevertheless interesting concept WataMote really tried to elicit too many emotions,and as a result could not draw any of them out properly,nor could it polish all of its characters,but it manages to stay enjoyable.\r\nWataMote follows the life of a shut-in teenager who has some really queer qualities. It follows her life as a high-school student, and her quest to acquire true friendship and romance-to become an ace of life. Our character is highly socially anxious and has low-self esteem,while constantly showing her resentment for others,through her thoughts and'subtle' actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is as eccentric as the show itself. We have Tomoko Kuroki,our main character,an introvert and overall weird person,her brother Tomoki,the popular boy in his class who loves to play sports,and although younger,assumes the mature sibling role. Tomoki is the person who our main character constantly goes to for advice on how to be more social. Next we have Naruse Yuu,Tomoko's best friend from middle school,and she acts as a sort of idol,or unattainable perfection for Tomoko,resulting in an unspoken jealousy on Tomoko's behalf. Aside from these three characters,we have some recurring characters like the student council president. The characters themselves are not spectacular or overtly unique,nut they're interesting enough.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not  a huge fan of the art style,but I can see how it would be appealing to some. The animation is not amazing,but it's alright. Personally,I like the soundtrack and think that the opening was really nice all considered.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWataMote was really strange experience. Now,it is by no means a masterpiece,or even close,but it was enjoyable,and is nice,all idiosyncrasies taken into account. It tried to bring out a multitude of emotions and in the end created a really strange mixture of them. To sum all of this up: WataMote is a strange telling of an awkward person's boringly exciting life.",

            "content": "Two years ago, I had watched the very first episode of the slice of life comedy anime Watamote, and since then I couldn't get enough of it. I know some people don't like Watamote because of its treatment of social anxiety but, as someone who has social anxiety, I think it handles social anxiety pretty well in, some ways. I get panicky and nervous when I am around crowds, and I unable to speak to people other than family members, so I'm just like Tomoko when I was 15 years old and in high school. \r\nLet's talk about the story of this controversial anime, shallwe? \\n\\n\r\nStory: It is about a popular girl named Tomoko Kuroki who has a lot of boyfriends and friends in the world of otome games. In reality, Tomoko is a unsociable loner who doesn't have any friends in her first year in high school. The series follows Tomoko as she attempts to improve her social status in high school. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting and easy to follow. I give it 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't magnificent like the manga art cover but it's beautiful nonetheless. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- Whimsical,  sorrow, joyful, and pleasant to hear. I love the background music whenever Tomoko is happy. It makes me smile all the time. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I don't like all of the episodes in Watamote, to be honest. Yes, they are likable ones like Tomoko, Yuu-chan, Tomoko's cousins, Tomoko's parents, and Megumi, but there also mean-spirited ones like one of  Tomoki's friends who called her ugly in the first episode. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoy it! 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a good anime with its ups and downs. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime, in my opinion, was sheer perfection. I love the whole slice of life aspect to the anime, though it did have its bad moments. I will warn you though, this show is not for everyone. But I think the reason why I personally love this anime so much is because I can relate so much to the protagonist.\r\nWatamote doesn't really have much of a storyline. A socially awkward girl starts her first year in high school, and all she wants is to become one of the popular girls. But because of her awkwardness, she never reaches this goal and becomes one of the\"unpopular\" girls. The whole unpopular high school girl thing is a total cliche in TV nowadays, but this anime presents in a non-cliched way; another reason why I enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing about Watamote that I liked the most was the characters. This show just simply does the characters... \"right\". Each character has their own unique personality, which leads me to  the main character: Tomoko Kuroki. Tomoko Kuroki is the protagonist of this series. Though she wants to make friends, and to even have a boyfriend, she is extremely bad at talking to people. She usually finds herself in very awkward situations. Her appearance and shyness gets her nowhere in developing good social skills, and also the fact that she usually ends up procrastinating. The only world world where Tomoko is successful is the Otome game world, where she can have as many \"boyfriends\" as she wants. Her only friend is Yuu Naruse, a preppy girl from her middle school, and she also has a younger brother named Tomoki Kuroki.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening theme to this anime, as well as the background music. Although the opening title sounds very misleading, the lyrics completely relate to the anime. I can't really say much about the voice acting, because to me the voice acting in anime all sounds the same, no matter if its Japanese dubbed or English dubbed. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Watamote is, in my opinion, simply amazing because of how relatable I am to it. There is so much to love about this anime. However, I warn you that this anime is not for everyone. So there is also a lot to hate.",

And by hardest doesn't mean what they could or should do, just to the extent of the best they are capable of doing..even though for most of us, we'd think its nothing much..\r\nFor one, I'm really impressed at the seiyuu for Tomoko, Izumi Kitta for her excellent portrayal of Tomoko. I'd sayshe did it perfectly. I feel amazed almost everytime I hear Tomoko speak to others in her small and shaky voice to the people she is not close with.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend people to watch this if you want to see a real 'slice-of-life' series.. One without harems and cliche'd happy lives and where optimism could make things better no matter what hardships happen.",

            "content": "Watamote or \"its ur guy's fault im not popular\" can sometimes be deemed as one of the most relatable series to have come out of the anime industry. Especially the particular character Tomoko. Shes nevertheless a complete mess when it comes to social interactions, deals badly with conflict and cant form proper relationships with people without messing up. Many criticize tomoko for doing the things she does. This is because they label her as an \"introvert\" and leave it as that. Its implied that introverts would never mess up with the situations tomoko are in because they would not get in them in the 1stplace. But people dont realize that Tomoko is far from being JUST an introvert. Through each episode we grasp bits of tomoko's personality and it can be safe to infer that she has serious social anxiety which is a disorder to be clear. She is even unable to properly speak to people without running away and puking it out later. This is not normal introvert behavior. Another misconception id liek to get out of the way is tomoko's lack of development. Clearly at the end of the series she hasn't changed at all. At least popularity wise. But she has changed ehr mindset about life in general, and this is a key point many dismiss. Tomoko through the end of the series states \"  it doesnt really matter\" which couldnt be more true. She realizes that highschool is just a temporary phase and the whole social status within are as irrelavant as highschool itself. She accepts the way she is, her hobbies and intrests and the way she lives in contrast to the beggining of the series, where she would constantly change her personality and perfrom silly antics to ahive her goals.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nThe story is pretty basic itself, high school girl in high school, going on about life in a cringe yet hilarious fashion\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nTomoko in general interests me alot, not because i particular relate in her extent. I dont stutter after every word i say and can normally adress people regardless of the lack of friends or whatever. I do enjoy gaming, stay inside most of the time, and dont have as much social interactions. But Tomoko's silly antics to become a popular girl, get a boyfriend and so on results in hilarious yet lowkey pitiful moments which keep me watching\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation quality is pretty high, despite the at stile being pretty basic\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nNot many of the soundtracks pop out except for the opening, and different endings each time, as well as the melancholy ost's of Tomoko;s failures. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI really don't know why but i find myself always going back to this series when im just bored and i still find myself laughing or relating or feeling for tomoko despite the fact that I already know what will happen\\n\\n\r\nDas about it, If u like watching a casual show about a social distressed girl going about her life, with pretty funny moments this is a show for you.\\n\r\nI dont say this often but the dub is pretty good *dont shoot me\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is meant to make you cringe and think about how being a hardcore Otaku is probably not good for you.\r\nWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (also known as WataMote) is a show about a freshman girl in high school named Tomoko who is the most extreme of the extreme when it comes to shut-in Otakus. Almost every aspect about her life is cringe worthy. She spends a lot of her time listening to Voice Acting clips that are supposed to be virtual boyfriends, reading manga, watching anime, and playing dating sims. Because of this, however, she's extremely socially awkward.Even her little brother sometimes doesn't know what to do with her because of how strange she is.\\n\r\nThe humor for the most part is spot on, but at the same time a lot of the humor for me made me squirm and want to groan. \\n\r\nTomoko is so socially awkward she can barely even talk to her \"best friend\" from middle school that she's known for a long time. However, when she's thinking to herself, she's often running her mental mouth, saying awful things about those around her who are so much better in general than her. She mentally badmouths people about having friends, and calls a lot of girls in her class names I don't want to repeat for worry about violating guidelines. She even has downright nasty thoughts about her own best friend because she sees her as someone who is better off than she is.\\n\r\nThroughout the show, though, she does have character development, however small. It sets you up for the big life-changing moment, only to throw a few pieces of confetti at you and dump you after squirming through the whole show.\\n\r\nThis one isn't for everyone, but if you like cringe humor poking fun at otakus, this one is for you.",

            "content": "Watamote is one of my very favorite franchises; I've been lucky enough to have followed it from the very first manga releases up through today. What Watamote brings to the table that no other work I've seen has is that it portrays the lifestyle of a loser, NEET, hikkikomori, or however else you'd phrase it, in a light that is both stark and realistic and also sympathetic and comedic. From what I can tell, most of the criticism the show receives is from folks for whom the character's struggles hit too close to home. Watamote doesn't have the tone though of a show that pickson the viewer; rather, it shows us the insider prospective of someone awkward and immature in both a way we can analyze and laugh at.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is brilliant in that it is what I'd call an 'un-mo\u00e9.' Tomoko, being less than confident in her own merits, frequently uses the kinds of 'get-popular-quick' schemes that, in mo\u00e9 animes, would work. She'll try adopting a persona of an 'anime hungry girl,' trying and failing to drink coffee in a trendy manner, or seducing her brother to predictably disastrous effects. When we are privy to Tomoko being a pervert, it is not presented with the kind of acceptance we'd see in an ecchi, instead either leaning into how bizarre it makes Tomoko. The interplay of the character with the show's refreshing, albeit perhaps gimmicky, tentpole makes for laughter and oof's in abundance.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't bursting with production value, however the artistic decisions are novel and amusing, with moody filters, use of kinetic typography and graphics, and even cubist renderings of Tomoko. Music and sound design are similarly on the quirky side, which really helps in establishing the mood, whether it be the na\u00efve optimism of one of Tomoko's plans being lain or the wasteland of cringe when the ugly duckling finally hatches.\\n\\n\r\nAt least in the realm of comedy, nothing has come close to Watamote for me in terms of enjoyment. That's perhaps what makes its lack of a second season such a bitter pill; it seems anime fans, many of whom could probably benefit from the kind of cultural and personal introspection Watamote can offer them, had their fill with one season. It's a cruel irony that Watamote, which offered a chance for mo\u00e9 slobs to take a look at themselves and what they're doing with their lives, have ditched it by the wayside in favor of the newest season's oppai lolis and brutish male characters lifting skirts at will to no discernable consternation. Further, while the show and manga series are not 100% congruent, I highly urge anyone who likes the one to try the other. This is practically mandatory viewing in my opinion to anyone who either suffers from the kind of personal anxiety Tomoko does or anyone mired in the muck of mo\u00e9 shows.",

            "content": "It's an interesting inversion of the \"Hollywood Nerd\" trope where a character is bullied, said to be ugly, but for the audience to sympathisze the character is made cute and not at all ugly but just wears glasses.\r\nIt's a show about a character that is not bullied, is not ugly, no one ever calls it ugly, in fact the character itself and many others remark that the character is somewhat cute. The character is certainly not portrayed as a stunning beauty queen but nevertheless above average looking; a silent, cute student that isn't bullied, whom no one has any ill will towards that is justignored simply because he doesn't say a word in class. Somehow they managed to create an entire show about a character who rarely ever speaks to anyone and is morbidly afraid of doing so by just playing the character's internal monologue which offers a resemblance of conversation.\\n\\n\r\nSome say it's a comedy but I haven't laughed once watching it and it's not like I thought it was a poor attempt at humour either; I didn't really see the attempt at humour. Pretty much every episode repeats a similar formula of Tomoko coming with a far-fetched plan to be noticed and popular only for it to fail because it's absolutely absurd and Tomoko can't seem to graps the basic thing that all he need do is go out and talk to people to probably be noticed and make friends due to being far too afraid of that.\\n\\n\r\nSo what would the appeal be? Some described the show as \"anti-moe\"; we're dealing with a character that many would consider to be terribly cute in its own deranged way; it's a moe slice of life show that does everything differently \u2014 instead of the cute, exuberant successful secondary school student we get a cute shut-in that lacks even the most basic of social skills and suffers from crippling social anxiety. I'm fairly certain that the only way one would possibly enjoy this show is if one think the main character is terribly cute for without it there's not much left to it. It's a slice of life show that thrives on the cuteness of its main character but does it in a whole different way than most.",

            "content": "Watamote is the perfect anime for incorrigible degenerates, such as myself. If you're into this show, you've probably either been a social retard or have had one as a friend before, because these are typical reasons for which one might resonate with the lead-role/social retard, Tomoko Kuroki. Tomoko provides plenty of gut-wrenchingly cringe inducing scenarios that are sure to either make you look like a fucking WEEEEIIRDO if your mom walks in on you watching it, or make you want to curl up and die. The second reaction is far more likely to happen if you've lived through the awkward scenario being shown onscreen, whichis likely to happen considering you like anime. Depending on your mood, this show will either make you feel better that other people have done equally retarded things as you did when  you were in high school, thus making you feel less alone in the world, or it'll put you in a state of crippling depression for approximately one hour after viewing. I experienced both. Luckily, this show is only 12 episodes long, so for an endurance run, it's not as painful to sit through as say Assterisk War or Camel Toe Online. \\n\r\nSide note: Tomoko is pretty strong beat-off material. Those lines under her eyes and greasy hair imply that in real life, she'd be kinda gross, but she has a cute voice and she's got that one eye covered by hair thing going on that faggots like me goosh our panties over. \\n\r\nThat all adds up to a seven out of ten.",

You might as well grow bald from pulling your hair out. The clenching of fists and teeth does not stop! If there is anything beneficial I got from this, it is a workout. I feel like the hulk from tensing the muscles all over my body. Now all that is left is to scream as loud as I can!!!!\r\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\r\nEach time you think you have seen something so embarrassing and something so stupid, but you end upseeing something more worse than the previous episode. It makes it so difficult to watch, but you keep on going because there is that element of duplicity that is secretly familiar to all of us. It is obviously exaggerated but that is the comical side of life that exists. We don't like to talk about it, and prefer to hide it under the carpet just before the guests arrive. Why do we do that? Well, we do it because it is not socially acceptable. It does not fit the \"IMAGE\" of how we are supposed to behave. We also want to portray a certain projection of ourselves into the world that is not realistic or honest.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I think about it. The behaviuor or tendencies of the main character were probably not crazy..... but rather the reactions of the cast that made her look more awkward. They are the secret ingredient in putting her in the spotlight and setting up a certain perspective that influences our understanding of the way things work.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Watamote\u2019s main aim was producing a show that otakus like you and me could relate to and when watching it you\u2019d be like  \r\n\"Holy Shit, that\u2019s me! That is totally me, I swear this exact awkward thing happens to me. I never get the girl or boy- I never get invited to parties and no one likes talking to me. TOMOKO IS MEEEEEEEE!\"\r\n*Nervously coughs* \r\nWatamote truly succeeds in making you feel of all of those things and also makes you feel as if you are watching a show based on your life. Well, that\u2019s what I felt because I am in a sense alot like Kuroki. Just not as sexually frustrated or hungry for popularity that is.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, when you watch a anime you usually feel like projecting yourself onto the main character- especially when it\u2019s a harem. However, in this show you don\u2019t want to project yourself onto Tomoki- but you still can\u2019t help but admit that you are just like her. Unless, you are popular and pretty then get the fuck out of here! *no not really though!*\\n\\n\r\nThat is the thing about Watamote I personally liked the most- but sadly that just was not enough to make the show stand out. But, I will get to the major issues of this show later. \\n\\n\r\nThe show hardly has any characters worth talking about except for our main female protagonist Tomoko Kuroki. Now, there are some things I loved about her and somethings I didn\u2019t. But, don\u2019t worry the positives outweigh the negatives. Tomoko is a very interesting character and the problems she faces are something that many people, especially girls go through in high school. She has trouble expressing herself to others- not to mention you feel bad for how lonely she is. That\u2019s why you want to root for her to the end. But, the main thing that made me care for her was of course her personality and that she is painfully shy like muah over here. This girl is hilarious and basically every otaku\u2019s spirit animal. She is a weird and crazy chick that is hands down epic. Reason why you don\u2019t care that the show hardly has any memorable supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the things I disliked about her character is her strong belief that she needs to be popular and also her lame attempts in becoming so. I know she is lonely and she does deserve close friends- but in the show\u2019s twelve episode run she never realized that life in high school isn\u2019t the end of the world. Not to mention, the actions she takes to get friends or become popular make me just nod my head left to right in disappointment. Cause, not even I was this desperate despite the fact I spent almost of my high school life in the corner of the class alone.  Heck, I still do in college!\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that bugged me, is that no one came to Kuroki\u2019s aid. Her parents nor her brother ever helped her come out of her shell and neither did her middle school friend. It isn\u2019t hard to realize how shy this girl is and no one supported her at all. I swear, this show would have been a whole lot better if they introduced a character who helps out Kuroki. They were actually hinting at something like later on- however the show ended before it could happen.\\n\r\nWatamote is a show that will disappoint many people- because it goes nowhere. Every episode is in the same pattern where you see Tomoko struggle and epically fail. That\u2019s the show in a nutshell and it doesn\u2019t try anything new than that. After a few episodes, it\u2019s get repetitive and you really wish there was more to it than just that. One thing Watamote does well is executing its comedic moments and cause they knock those parts right out of the park. I remember, that there were certain moments where I just freaking lost it \\n\\n\r\nThe show tries so hard not to be like those clich\u00e9d shoujo and or school anime- and heck even pokes fun at them \u2013not to mention they throw in a  shit tonne of anime references which is enjoyable. But, in the process of doing so- Watamote forgets to actually present a show in which the audience will find satisfying. Our main character hardly changes despite all that happens to her and hence the story suffers a lot from it. Not to mention, the lack of impactful characters is a huge flaw of its own. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation it is pretty standard fair and something that suits this type of show very well. The main issue I have with it would the disappearing faces on the characters- not to mention all the silhouettes. But, some times they played a role at showing how lonely Tomoko really is. The character designs are nothing that original either- well except for Kuroki and her brother. I swear, they look like Moe anime characters after having a bad hangover. I loved their designs as from just looking at these two you are like \"Yep these are geeks who stay up late at night playing hentai games!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Watamote was very average and it\u2019s basically \u2018Moe\u2019 meets metal.  And to be honest I am not a big fan of the opening. The animation is cool- but the lyrics and beat really do not scream greatness for me. One track I really did love from Watamote was called \u2018 Tear Breaker\u2019 and that was honestly the only thing that stood out. That song however sounds like it belongs on Fate/Zero\u2019s album though! \\n\\n\r\nLastly, other than its realistic portrayal of a shy and introverted otaku- Watamote also has a good dub. Monica Rial gives an excellent performance as Tomoko Kuroki- and I must admit it\u2019s probably one of my favorite performance of hers. Yes, sometimes I get annoyed how she uses the same voice for most of her characters- but that wasn\u2019t the case Watamote. Yes, you still could tell it\u2019s her- but you can also tell Monica was having fun voicing Tomoki and also did a great job of emoting the character perfectly. The supporting cast members did a great job too and so Emily Neves who was the ADR director did a brilliant job with this dub. The dialogue was entertaining as hell and the cast members really gave it their all. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Watamote is not the worst anime I have seen but it is really disappointing. It could have been something great- but it wasted all of its potential. Instead of developing Tomoko and making her story more interesting- they kept recycling the same gag in hopes that it would stand out and be better than any  other typical school anime. Not to mention- the ending of the show didn\u2019t even feel like it helped conclude the story in any way possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is by no means is boring- and it has some great moments. However, overall the show will make you feel as if you have gained nothing from watching it. And so, I am going to award Watamote with a 6 and that it was \u2018Meh!\u2019 If Watamote, does ever get another season I will definitely watch it- with hopes it will fix all the issues I recently addressed. But, I doubt it ever will ! \\n",

            "content": "Review #2: 0taku_St0rm VS WataMote\r\nWataMote. What can I say about it? WataMote is a fun anime. The show is filled with laughs, cringes, and sympathy towards the main character Tomoko Kuroki(Read Main Character Mindset if you want to know in more detail about her chracter).\r\nQuick Review: WataMote is a show that I believe shouldn't go unwatched. You're given a socially awkward girl just trying to become popular in her high school, y'know like in anime and her romantic video games, but as we all know, real life is completely different. You don't always get to retry and make that boy or girl fall for you,you can't just sit next to a window in class and expect to become a protagonist of the world with a harem swarming around you.That type of stuff takes work but Tomoko doesn't know this. She's a quiet, awkward girl who shows a severe case of social anxiety, and you want to be with her every step of the way hoping she becomes a popular girl. With the laughs, cringes, and sympathy throughout this anime, you want to make sure this show gets those 12/12 episodes on your watchlist.\\n\\n\r\nFull Review (Maybe Spoilers)\\n\r\n9/10 Main Character Mindset\\n\r\nTomoko is a brand new character who I haven't really seen before in any cartoon really. To put it lightly she's a freak. But, I support this freak! Tomoko is a shy, quiet girl, dreaming of popularity and the harassment of a male harem. She's dark, scary, and oh-so-ever weird. I think everyone has a bit of Tomoko inside of them though. Tomoko, basically just doesn't want to be absolutely alone. Throughout the series she is only shown to have one friend, who goes to a different school, looks gorgeous, and has friends, leaving Tomoko to be by herself. She also works hard to reach her far away goals. She tries to talk to more people throughout the show, tries to get over her social anxiety,  buy the clothes that are in style during the time, and even go out to buy sexy underwear. So, when her hope is lost, she's failed miserably, or when she's crying (One scene specifically on episode 9), you have to feel for the girl who works so hard to reach her dreams and make them come true. She's an awesome character with the support of side characters making this show a blast to watch just to see Tomoko do what she does.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Humor\\n\r\nThis show is hilarious. Awkward moments run amok during the 12 episode run of the show, including Tomoko's dad walking in with Tomoko asleep holding a vibrator, Tomoko's mother walking in on her while playing an edited audio clip of some very...suggestive quotes, and of course the scene in the rain between her and two boys. You'll cringe, you'll OMG, above all you will laugh. Although there are moments where you will get caught in your feelings, some moments are just too much. Oh, and there are plenty of references to other shows, Kuroko no Basuke and Another(That's the title of the show) off the top of my head. I got super hype when they referenced Another though.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 Plot\\n\r\nThe show is pretty straightforward. Unpopular, weird girl wants to be popular. You'll usually get two stories within an episode. The stories are good it's just that there's not much to do with the show except to put her in quirky scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nMemorable Anime\\n\r\nI think this show is gonna stick with me for awhile. There's a character who thinks like me in a lot of certain scenarios, something that I don't get in a lot of my anime. Tomoko is a great mc to have, with a good supportive cast, and cooky situations to put her in. Go watch WataMote. 8/10",

            "content": "So the manga was apparently VERY popular among the popular website 4chan and it's anime board, /a/. I should know, I was there. And low and behold, it was green-lit for an anime adaptation. They were so excited to see what would happen, and low and behold, it was a disappointment.\r\nWatamote deals with a 15 year old named Matoko who is entering high school and while she thinks she's the biggest thing in high school history (if there is such a thing), she soon realizes that she is not popular at all, only in her head, and now she deals with overcoming her VERY hugelack of social skills and trying to make friends and overall, a boyfriend. Madness ensues as she goes from giving herself a makeover, to talking to her best friend about boys, to watching a couple (from on top of her high school's roof with two middle school kids) doing it in a hotel across her high school.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Tomoka is one that is just not memorable unless you were that awkward virgin in high school who had the popular friend and made yourself look like an ass every opportunity you got, and her best friend is the girl you wanted the looks and body of but of course, with every alpha there has to be a beta, and sadly, that was you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a series that you can tell was not popular with the japanese audience. It flopped and has yet to be green-lit for a second season. You can tell this by the way it ends (if you are like me, you will not like the ending of this show) that it did not do well and personally, it shows. As much as I wanted this show to succeed, it did not find happiness and we will only be able to wait until more Watamote is made or the manga hits big selling numbers once again.\\n\\n\r\nJebus gives Watamote: 2 hugs from a purple puppy dog out of 5.",

            "content": "(First review. Sorry for the formality, I'm too accustomed to churning out verbose bullshit for university essays.) Watamote is a strong and memorable anime because it offers an evocative and incisive insight into the nature of anxiety. Watamote maps the high school experiences of Tomoko, a chronically anxious, cynical, alienated and occasionally depressed protagonist. I generally judge anime according to its conceptual and emotional complexity. Watamote definitely delivers on the latter but not the former. The narrative doesn't show any particular thematic or character-related development, so it is ultimately limited in its meaningful quality. However, Tomoko's story succeeds in evoking theups-and-downs of high school on the smaller stage of an anxiety-ridden life. Watamote uses black humour to present the practical and emotional flux of Tomoko's undertakings in an unaffected, unmoderated way. Tomoko comes up with a lot of initiatives to become popular and secure her sense of identity amongst her peers. Yet each time she tries to implement a scheme, she receives contradictory feedback from her distorted perspective and from her variable real-world experiences. Diverging from the idealistic character empowerment within many different anime-verses, Watamote never attempts to rescue Tomoko from her humiliation through tropes or other convenient plot devices. This is what makes Watamote such an enduringly affective anime. Tomoko remains a complex and realistic protagonist who is both embittered and individualized. We are shown the full, largely static picture of Tomoko's life and personality, gory details included. It is left to the individual viewer to draw their own impressions and decisions. \\n\\n\r\n     Tomoko's social world appears to be a fairly tolerant (albeit indifferent) one, particularly for high school. Tomoko also retains a loyal, caring friend from middle school and a slightly jaded younger brother. What really holds her back in every potential transformation is her extreme social anxiety and comorbid isolation.  Tomoko frequently visualizes her fundamental social alienation by perceiving surrounding people as grey, non-interactive silhouettes; at some points, she imagines herself as appearing bland or transparent to other people. Tomoko's dark and nondescript colours contrast with the brighter colours of perceived socially functional characters, particularly female ones. Interestingly, Tomoko's insecurity in this area is quite gendered. She worries about drawing too much (or too little) attention as a female, shows some signs of internal misogyny (such as spitefully calling other girls 'sluts') and fantasises about presenting an ideal feminine persona. I think this is an interesting and important insight, as it suggests how women may experience anxiety in particularized ways. Watamote's portrayal of Tomoko as a socially anxious girl may offers a valuable counterpart to other comparable depictions of anxiety (like Satou's in NHK). Overall, Watamote is an absorbing anime that evokes a range of visceral emotions and invites an empathetic understanding of social anxiety. \\n",

I admit, there were a few times where I paused the anime to prepare myself for the second hand embarrassment that was to follow. But you know what? I also laughed my ass off watching this anime.\r\nIf I had to use one word to describe Tomoko, I would use the word endearing. Her cringey adventures are cute in a sense, as she navigates adolescence in her own way. I find her to be very relatable. Even if you had a lot of friends, or were popular, haven't we all in the past, done some odd things inorder to feel accepted? I think that is the whole point of the anime, showing the pitfalls and awkwardness of high school. \\n\\n\r\nThe situations Tomoko had to face were very hilarious and enjoyable to watch. I also really liked how the anime alludes to other works of anime in clever ways.\\n\\n\r\nMe only complaint is that I wish the series had more episodes, because I certainly enjoyed watching her adventures, all the while reminiscing of my former awkward high school life.",

After all most of us had simillarly embarrasing episodes in our lives. And every time she does something stupid you can't help but cringe. However the longer you watch the more obvious the whole over-the-top-ness of the situation becomes. Because actually Tomoki is a horrible person who really deserves her current social status andtakes no steps towards learning from her mistakes - in fact every next episode she makes stipider and stupider mistakes. And then you realize that it's simply a black comedy and laugh the rest of the show",

Assuming you read the synopsis. Let me conform:\r\n-The story has no ups. It is 12 episodes about the gloomy life of a gloomy person. \r\n-Every episode is about how she plans to become popular and the plans never work out.\r\n-The plans are stupid. And shehas no guts to start a conversation.\\n\r\n-It is understandable to hesitate a few times but every episode is about her failing at conversing. The anime ends without her ever succeeding.\\n\r\n-In the end the MC is a sad character who can only think of becoming popular (esp. with guys). But she can not go and talk to people upfront.\\n\r\n-The only way you can like the anime is if you somehow find it funny instead of irritating. \\n\r\n-The best thing about the anime is the OP song (not that it is great. more like it is interesting). \\n\r\n-This anime does not come close to Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru or Welcome to the NHK. Don't watch this just because you liked any of these anime. And if you din't like them then definitely do not watch this.\\n\r\n-This is also nothing like Kami Nomi. The gaming part is not an essential part of her character. And the MC's are very different.\\n\r\n-Still, if you want to watch this anime you can.

The often depressing nature of it will not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're sick of seeing anime that rehash the same old tropes over and over again I suggest you check this one out.",

            "content": "Tomoko Kuroki is a girl who is just starting high school. All she does is play games, read manga and watch anime. She suffers from a horrible case of social anxiety and although she wants to fit in and have friends, it's incredibly difficult for her. Each episode involves Kuroki trying to come up with ways for others to notice her and admire her but everything she tries to do comes from the games that she plays and the anime that she watches. Nothing goes right and she is alienated by her classmates.\r\nIt's very weird but everything that Kuroki thinks, says and experiences is alltoo similar to me. When I was in school, I didn't have any friends, and I barely talked to anyone. I suffered from social anxiety and never knew how to talk to others. The things I see Kuroki do to try and fit in all incredibly similar to the things I tried to do. Just like her, I would get social advice from TV and video games and try to use it in real life (which didn't work). Just like her, I'd lie to try and make myself seem cooler. Just like her, I'd try to develop a persona that everyone would admire. I'd embarrass myself and feel pretty terrible and lonely. While watching Kuroki live her life, all I could picture was myself in her shoes, because I've been there, that's how I lived my teenage years. It's really hard trying to fit in when you can't talk to people. But what I really loved is that Kuroki never gave up on trying to fit in. In each episode she would think of something new to try and get people to notice her. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough social anxiety is really sad and not exactly something you should get comedy out of, it was pretty funny to watch Kuroki live her sad depressing life. It is cringe comedy, so if you don't like seeing cringyness then you might not enjoy it. But one of the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because I know what it's like. Kuroki's personality towards others is so perfect and what she thinks of everyone is absolute gold. Kuroki's character is so perfect, it's amazing how well developed of a character she is. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I did watch it dubbed and although Monica Rial is probably the English voice actress that I hate the most, I think she did an amazing job making Kuroki as cringy as possible. Dubs always have their flaws, but I think this one was pretty good. The music, I thought was amazing, the opening scared the crap out me the first time because I wasn't expecting it, but it's absolutely one my favorite openings.\\n\\n\r\nI thought this anime was amazing, it really projects social anxiety in a realistic and comedic way. I can say first hand that the Slice of Life nature of this anime is incredibly accurate. This anime will make you cringe a bit but it's still really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n-Kuroki, almost everything about her is exactly how I was when I was in high school and kinda still am today. It's actually pretty eerie how similar we are and I'd like to know how many others feel the same way. We are not alone.\\n\r\n-The social anxiety aspect of the show is pretty cringe but it's absolutely accurate\\n\r\n-The references to games/anime were pretty fun to watch\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\r\n-I'm not a big fan of cringe comedy, so at times it was a bit hard to watch",

Watamote follows a antisocial girl named Tomoko Kuroki entering highschool. Most of the time with in the show,we're shown what's in Tomoko's mind. The show's humor is mostly in Tomoko's dialogue and her embarrassing moments. I find the show enjoyable but with the endurance test of \"Oh God that's me.\" The show has many references to other animes but I'm not to write them down,mainly 'cause of laziness. The two other characters are Yuu,Tomoko's best friend's, and Tomoki,Tomoko's younger brother. You don'tget that in depth with them, except of Tomoko's perspective of them.Overall, I think it's worth your time,but you might feel uncomfortable afterwards. That's all I have to say about the show.",

Watamote is an anime about a girl that is a shut-in and has trouble talking to anyone but family and her one friend. This anime is funny as hell and at times could be really depressing, you tend to get the feeling of \"damn I feel bad for her.\" a lot, even though the anime is a pure comedy I just feel sometimes the writer went a tad to hard on Tomoko, any time something good happens too her it gets countered and its like \"no wait nevermind\"and then whatever good thing happened turns to some sort of misunderstanding. Without spoiling anything the anime gets pretty dark near the end and subtly too they aren't too in your face with it but you'll pick up signs right away. Do I reccomend this anime YES, if you want a good time that will make you feel a little melancholy then go ahead watch it but if you don't want to get depressed because it hits too close to home I reccomend watching something lighter about otaku.",

            "content": "I don't really know if I cringed more, or felt honestly bad for Tomoko while watching this. I don't really think it matters though.\r\nTo start off small, this anime is about a girl named Kuroki Tomoko who is socially inept and a shut-in. She prides herself on the fact that she has no friends and despises almost everyone around her, despite wanting to make friends and socialize with her classmates all the time. She lives her daily life playing video games, watching \"YouTube\" videos and basically lazing around a whole lot regretting what she has sowed upon herself through out her first year of highschool. She's also a bit suicidal and has some pretty nasty anxiety. To put it simply, this anime is about a shut-in creepy girl who tries to make friends, but fails miserably.\\n\\n\r\nYou can probably tell that this anime is very 'character' driven, as the story is basically non-existent. I mean the entire story & point of this anime is all right up there. But to delve a bit deeper, there's a good reason why I didn't give this anime a three or below in it's score. Let me explain.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, I have had my own bouts with anxiety and can relate pretty well as to what she may have been experiencing. Social anxiety's are no joke and real people deal with problems that our Tomoko here was experiencing (but probably not as severe as her). There were times that it would go over board and just be flat-out cringe, but what do you expect from someone who's completely socially inept in basically every way possible. The real reason this show fails though, is that there's no \"build\" to maybe see her overcome her anxiety as the show progresses. The ending (which isn't a huge spoiler, if anything at all) was completely dulled out and made me feel disappointed with an anime I was enjoying for the most part. I wish this show could have given me more to experience, but instead we got a cringe-fest and no conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art & sound were fair. The OP was pretty cringe too, and I'm not really sure how they could have done that, but it's honestly kinda impressive. Nothing too special here though.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this anime is certainly NOT for everyone. Many people will hate this anime purely for the fact that it's so cringe-y and self-deluded. Tomoko could have developed into a much more interesting character over time, but what I saw was the same thing over and over again. It's not bad, it's just lazy. I would only recommend watching this if you can relate to anything I said above. In all honestly it does get somewhat funny here and there, and there are parts to enjoy, but it's definitely not for everyone.",

            "content": "There came a point during watching this show that I realized that the protagonist, Tomoko Kuroki, can be related to almost everybody. This is a major success given that empathy with a character is one of the biggest goals to achieve in any form of writing. Just about any awkward social situation you can think of, Tomoko gets dumped into.\r\nTomoko is a shy little girl that has such anxiety at placing herself in social situations, and can hardly speak when addressing other people that are not her family. Actually, all she wants in life is to be popular and get a little coterie of friendsand a boyfriend. Unfortunately, her anxiety in being in social situations is paralyzing for her.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the time Tomoko is invested in coming up with Wile E. Coyote schemes to make herself more popular. These tend not to go the way she imagines them. She's usually failing in one or more drastic ways for maximum cringe. I couldn't help feel sorry for Tomoko, because I know what it's like to transfer to a new school and have absolutely 0 friends and be too shy to talk to the other kids. I know what it's like to go an entire year like that.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing that I'm remiss about in this show is that it only ran for one season, and nothing was really resolved with Tomoko. She's still the same cringy loser at the end of the season as she is at the beginning. It's not for lack of trying. Tomoko really does want others to notice her and be her friend. I wanted to know more about Tomoko's story, does she befriend Megumi Imae, the friend she so desperately needs? Or does she remain that same cringy girl forever? Not sure this show will ever get a second season, but I'd definitely be on the lookout if it did.",

            "content": "Watashi ga Motenai no wa ga D\u014d Kangaetemo Omaera Warui! abbreviated in WataMote, a work considered like a masterpiece in terms of anime on shut-ins. As i like particularly everything that turn around from this thematic, I watched this anime without knowing what to expect, for finally be disappointed.\r\nLet's start with his main problem : His main character, Tomoko Kuroki.\r\nWhat bothers me with this character, this is the role that fits in this anime.\r\nTomoko Kuroki is a shut-in who entered in high school and wants to be popular, but she is so antisocial that when she trying to speak with someone, she becomes very uncomfortable.She spends her days playing Visual Novels and make references to the Japanese pop culture.\\n\r\nThe problem is here, the anime is full of references to the shovel, like Kiseijuu or Death Note. But what is the use ? To make easy referenced humor and satisfy the brainless spectator, happy to see a reference to his favorite anime.\\n\\n\r\nBesides, let's talk about the humor of WataMote. Besides greasy sexual jokes, WataMote is what might be called a Cringe Comedy, which is a kind of comedy where the intention is to make the audience laugh but also make him uncomfortable and generally the main character is a victim of this humor, which is also the case for WataMote. But here, it doesn't work because : One, most of the scenes which are supposed to be funny because uncomfortable are not funny because, Two, the humor is focuses on Tomoko.\\n\r\nThe scenes of WataMote where I was supposed to laugh was when Tomoko was stressing to death because she was trying to talk to people, and then when she was acting weird because she is dumb (or so extremely awkward). But not only, it's not funny, but in addition, that becomes painful to watch, and I come to prefer Tomoko than the anime itself (which is paradoxical for a character that was created to be hateful and obnoxious).\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's even more unbearable when i see minor characters who completely don't care about Tomoko (except at certain moments). I take for example the beginning of episode 6, where Tomoko's mother said that she's fine than usual by his usual dark circles that have disappeared. So that means she knew her daughter wasn't well but she was doing nothing for help her, thanks Mom (because Dad appears only in ONE episode).\\n\\n\r\nAnd when it's not the characters, it's the story itself. Because WataMote repeat the same narrative scheme for 12 episodes (\"Tomoko trying to accomplish something, but it fails\") and doesn't evolve the main character. The only time I expected to see Tomoko evolve are immediately defused by a joke like \"It was a dream lol\" and it's very frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nBut I assure you, WataMote has qualities. The animation is not ugly even if she has her ups and downs. The OST is not very memorable but still nice to hear, special mention to the opening which in addition has a good music, shows us the true Tomoko (symbolically).\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have read, I didn't really like WataMote and I don't recommend this. However, if you want a good anime with the theme of shut-ins, I can only recommend you to watch the very good \"NHK ni Y\u014dkoso!\"\\n",

            "content": "Oh, Watamote, how this show played with my feelings without a mercilessly. The ups and downs I went through, all over just twelve episodes. \r\nThe story, basically goes nowhere. No huge plot development, no big grand scheme. But it's very relatable. This is one of the few shows where people can actually be like \"gosh, that's so much like me.\" And they cringe at the thought of it. You feel sorry for her while laughing at her at the same time. It's a tragic story, covered up by light humor. The sad part is there are so many girls out there just like Tomoko, suffering.It draws you in even with the lack of story. Everyday things in Tomoko's life are made interesting.\\n\r\nThe art is average. What can I say? Nothing remarkable. Nothing horrible. I did like Tomoko's different faces though, very entertaining.\\n\r\nThe opening was okay. The ending was cute. Again, nothing extraordinary  here. Hatsune Miku sung one ending which made me happy. Tomoko's voice actor did a good job. \\n\r\nThe highlight of the show is Tomoko herself. Sure, there are a few side characters but this show is all about Tomoko. You hear her thoughts, see her world. She is really quite the character, definitely not boring, I will say that. She is hilarious, perverted, depressing, and it's wonderful yet horrible. So many mixed feelings, but you can't help but love her.\\n\r\nIf enjoying means cringing every time Tomoko did something stupid (so all the time) and laughing my ass off while she does it, then yes I did. It was a good 12 episodes and kept me entertained. There isn't a very amazing ending, but really, what did we expect to happen? This is supposed to be like real life.\\n\r\nSo I give it an 8, it is a very memorable anime but it is not perfect, not many animes are.  \\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been staying clear of most anime lately because it either A.) doesn\u2019t interest me in the least, or B.) is Attack on Titan and I swear I\u2019ll watch it sometime when everyone shuts the hell up about it. In the case of Watamote, I ended up watching it because a friend showed me the opening sequence, told me Tomoko Kuroki is me as a Japanese school girl, then got mad when I wouldn\u2019t shut up about how fucking perfect Tomoko is.\r\nThe show is like Welcome to the NHK lite. A girl, Tomoko Kuroki, is completely socially awkward, demented, in love with anime and nerdculture, and doesn\u2019t understand how the world works.  It follows her life as a freshman in high school, a world where everything sucks, no one is her friend, and she can barely do anything without failing. Most of the failure come out of normal, everyday social situations while the rest come from demented fantasies. It\u2019s a show aimed at a demographic that rightly knows who they are and rightly understand the situations that Tomoko gets into. The show gets a lot of hate from some people who rightly know that they are just like Tomoko and reject the fact that someone made a show aimed at them, but to me, I\u2019m not afraid to laugh at myself. Just like Welcome to the NHK, it\u2019s there for people with social problems and total nerds who aren\u2019t afraid to look at themselves in the mirror and laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows its respective manga pretty well, in fact it rarely deviates from the source material. Sometimes the anime puts a part from the manga before it happened in the manga, but that doesn\u2019t matter. The problem the anime faces as opposed to the manga, which managed to stay pretty balanced, is that there is a slump in the middle of the series where a few of the scenarios and episodes fall into general comedy tropes. The most embarrassing offender is the panty episode. While chuckle-worthy at points, it deviates so far from the fairly original comedy of the previous few episodes. And then there\u2019s a part where Tomoko wants to get raped on the train because she feels it would make her feel popular. While kind of funny and contributing to that skewed view of popularity that she has, it\u2019s not as relatable or likable as her previous and later attempts at popularity.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is excellent when it goes through real life scenarios rather than crazy ones. The episode where she goes to Starbucks, doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s ordering, and ends up screwing up royally after getting her coffee is funny, but also really cute and sad in a way. It\u2019s when she\u2019s doing very normal things that you feel so bad that she screws up so much or can\u2019t manage to do it. Another example is the very first episode where she has to say goodbye to her teacher. Those moments of social awkwardness that can be related to are where the show shines. It\u2019s a new kind of humor that is funny because it\u2019s realistic and relatable for many people. Which is why some of the more outlandish attempts at humor fall flat; they just don\u2019t seem to fit in. They fit Tomoko\u2019s character, but they don\u2019t fit the style of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as supporting characters go Tomoki is Tomoko\u2019s brother and a rather unattached and unlikable fellow. Her mom is just there to be a mom. Her best friend Yuu is a busty\u2014as Tomoko would call her\u2014\u201cbitch\u201d with very little personality. But that\u2019s one of the main points of the show. That\u2019s why I can understand the faceless background characters. Tomoko lives in a world where everyone has the same personality, everyone is looking for a girlfriend to bang. It\u2019s seemingly one of the reasons she is the way she is, she sees the world as being totally faceless and everyone to be without a distinguishing personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the comedy combined with the style of animation and great directing really lead to a very unique show that has a few slip ups along the way, but manages to continue being funny and original for much of its run. It\u2019s in no way perfect, but Watamote is really damn good.",

            "content": "Alrighty, Wata Mote! What an \"interesting\" anime. However before I begin my review I would just like to say this: This review DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS! READ AT YOU OWN DIGRESSION! Anyways let's start with the story!\r\nStory\r\nNow, Wata Mote being the rom/com anime that it is, I am sure no surprise will come to you rom/com veterans that the story in Wata Mote is, well, sparse. While Wata Mote does start off with the strong end goal of the main character (Tomoko) having the best High School experience possible, and being loved and adored by all her classmates, other than this there is no alternative plotline. The story strongly revolved around Tomoko 90% of the time, and her handful of uninteresting associates the other 10% of the time. One of the most unique (and enjoyable) aspect of Wata Mote's story, is it's unpredictability. Once you are fully acquainted with the show and it's rapid and odd plot twists it is not too difficult to loosely predict Tomoko's actions, however for the most part the future is greatly unpredictable, and that, I believe, is what makes Wata Mote, immensely interesting and different from every other rom/com before it. Well that, and the characters, but that's a topic for a different paragraph :P\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest the art in Wata Mote is nothing to brag about. It takes a sort of dark theme, with many dark blues as well as black. It fits and suites the show well and that is all I can say for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing to brag about here. The sound is average. Nothing special about it. In terms of character's voices, the main character's (Tomoko's) fits her figure and personality quite well, but other than that the remaining characters voices are what they are/should be expected to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nInstead of writing a long-ass summary on all the characters together, I will be splitting this section of the review up into short paragraphs for each main character.\\n\\n\r\nKuroki, Tomoko: Easily the most memorable and well written character, Tomoko is a ball full of joy. To watch I mean, not literally ;-; On the outside Tomoko appears to be your stereotypical, shut-in - socially awkward, pale, small, and grumpy. However, on the inside we find that she is SO much more. While every recluse has their own way of dealing with their social problems, Tomoko's are, to say the least, \"interesting\". One example in the anime, is when Tomoko goes throug a phase in which she matches her personality to that of a stereotypical anime character, such as the cute, quiet one that boys always try converse with to no avail. However she soon finds this only works if boys actually try to talk to her. Another example is when she hides her phone in a desk and sets it to record her classmates conversations, so that she can hear the things they say about her and adjust herself accordingly. Again, she realizes that this does not work when no one talks/cares (rip) about her. In conclusion Tomoko is one of the most interesting anime characters around, and is a monumental part of Wata Mote.\\n\\n\r\nNaruse Yuu: Tomoko's best, and possibly only friend Naruse Yuu (or as commonly referred to in the anime as Yuu-Chan) Yuu-Chan, Tomoko's childhood friend's biggest impact on the show and Tomoko is the change she undergo's between middle school and high school. In flash backs to middle school, we see Yuu-Chan as a short, flat-chested girl with dark hair and glasses. Much like Tomoko she is unpopular and quite shy. However, in high school we see Yuu-Chan as almost the opposite of her former self. Now she is a tall, beautiful blonde - outgoing and cheerful. While Tomoko is awestruck after meeting her for the first time after middle school (as are the viewers who have only seen her in middle school flashbacks), Yuu-Chan simply explains that all of her classmates really go \"all out\" and that she had to too just to fit in. In conclusion while Yuu-Chan is not a very interesting character, her influence on Tomoko is crucial.\\n\\n\r\nKuroki, Tomoki:Tomoki is the pure embodiment of one the most blantly boring and overused style for an anime character. He is your typical \"younger brother\" (even though he looks, and acts older) who, looks very similar to his sister, always has dark circles under his eyes, and is always moody. He is also extremely talented at both soccer, and school in general, and (of course) Tomoko resents him for this. His only regular appearances in the show are every/every other episode for Tomoko's \"Nightly Talks\".  This is basically when Tomoko forces herself into her brother's room, sits down, and starts talking about random things. She does this, in the hope, that she will slowly become a better conversationalist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why I enjoyed this anime so much and why I gave it a \"9\" or \"Great\". \\n\\n\r\n1st Reason: Uniqueness. I can easily tell you right now that Wata Mote is one of the most unique rom/com anime you will ever come across. While the majority of it's characters are cl\u00edched, and overused in terms of their personalities and designs, Tomoko alone makes up for that and more\\n\\n\r\n2nd Reason: Relating. I am sure many of you will be confused as to what I am talking about in this section but please, bare with me. Anyways, here is what I mean by relating. While many of you I'm sure won't really be able to relate to Tomoko's bizzare situation, I'm sure a few of you can. For me, personally, I cannot say my life is exactly like that of Tomoko in Wata Mote; That would be ridiculous. However, it is similar enough so that I can, in a way, relate to what Tomoko is going through, and for whatever reason, that just makes me like the show so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nOverall while the anime has a fantastic, original main character, and an interesting plot line, it simply does not have interesting enough supporting characters. Wata Mote is an interesting and unique, and I would definitely recommend it to any rom/com anime fans looking for something new. However, be warned, if you start to feel as though you dislike Tomoko at the beginning, better hop off now! It's gonna be one hell of a ride, disliking her.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying the only thing even remotely decent about this anime is the art. The reason for this, is because this anime was so obnoxious and boring all together that I couldn't even finish it... I normally finish even the most appalling of anime, but this was just too much.\r\nThe pathetic story of this sounds interesting, but it's played out so horribly bad that I found myself just falling asleep in the middle of each episode. 24 minutes per episode was just way too long to bare.\r\nThe voice acting of the main character annoyed the crap out of me. Especially whenshe was talking to herself in her head. If I were her brother, I don't think I would have lived through more than a week dealing with her. I would have killed myself.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the main character, she has got to be the worst anime character since all of the characters of One Piece. Boring and annoying. At least the One Piece of crap characters were exciting...\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the description, I thought this would be a relate able and unique anime. After even one episode, I realized how horrible wrong I was... By episode 3, I began to feel I've wasted close to 4 hours of my life because of how many times I had fallen asleep and how annoying this anime had become. By episode 5, I became determined to finish this anime just to say I did as an accomplishment. Lastly, by episode 10, I gave up. I just couldn't do it.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was that bad. Appalling beyond measure. Worst anime I've ever attempted to watch. If I could rate it -10, it wouldn't be negative enough.",

            "content": "(This is a video version script with some parts edited out to make it make more sense! I hope you enjoy!)\r\nFirst thing I gotta say about this anime, it will make your cringe, it will make you laugh and honestly this anime is a little sad. Hey I rymed there! So when I finished this anime off I thought it would be a perfect anime to create a review about so here we are today. Just a warning though there are spoilers in this anime review to help with my points. If you haven't watched the anime you should leave and come back when youhave watched it.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier this anime may make you cringe or laugh or both at the same time. Some of the things that our MC Kuroki Tomoki do are funny but also cringe-worthly like when in episode one she tried to look more attravtive but ended up looking... well i can't find a word to explain it other than ugly.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki herself has really nothing special going for her other than she is a kinda cute anime girl. Tomoki however has a goal for high school, she wants to become popular! The only issue with that is she's a complete introvert who has troubles talking with her own teachers!Whenever someone talks to her other than he family and Yuu-chan she starts to freak out and talks in broken up and quiet sentances. \\n\\n\r\nAlso a lot of the stuff she does just makes her come off as a bad person, an example is at the end of episode 11 she cheats in a Yu-Gi-Oh match against a bunch of kids or how she treats her brother poorly throughout the episode even when he stayed home from school sick.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music perfectly fits the anime and the Opening is amazing! First off I thought the opening was kinda weird to be in a Slice of Life anime but after a while of watching it you kinda get used to it and now I even have it downloaded on my phone, which I am using to record this video!\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation was good, nothing special for me to talk about here so this section is short.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed WataMote, it made me cringe a few times but laugh alot at those cringe moments!",

            "content": "Teenagers are a social mess. They can be oblivious, lonely, disconnected from the world or fixated with popularity. And, somehow, the protagonist of Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! is all of these things.\r\nWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! (No Matter How I Look At It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Unpopular!), often shortened as WataMote, is a 2013 comedy anime produced by the studio Silver Link. Its director is Shin Oonuma, who also was responsable for Kokoro Connect and Baka to Test.\r\nKuroki Tomoko is an otaku that just began high school expecting to be popular. Aftera couple of months, she realizes she is not popular in any way, actually, she hasn't talked to anyone at school yet. This realization makes her even more fixated with popularity, which makes her able to go to any lengths to accomplish her objective.\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is a comedy, but it does have a setting with a lot of potential to develop its characters. However, it is too focused on the comedy to make any kind of progress character or storywise. All of this results in a storyline that can simply be summarized in one sentence: Tomoko wants to be popular.Tomoko could have had a fairly strong development and multiple opportunities to do that arose during the course of the anime, sadly, they were completely wasted. Through the overwhelming part of the anime, she doesn't change or evolve in any way whatsoever, and when it finally does happen it is done in a post-credits scene with no real build up.\\n\\n\r\nWataMote boasts of a fairly big supporting the cast, but they are hardly more than caricatures. However, all of them are fairly accurate representations of teenagers, albeit very exaggerated, and this includes Tomoko. These teenagers are all basically looking for one thing: friends, which for Tomoko means popularity.\\n\\n\r\nAs I already said, WataMote is a comedy, which means most of your attention should be directed to that aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDifferently from most other anime, WataMote is a comedy about failure. Most of the comedy comes from how far she goes to become popular, such as trying to make herself prettier or deciding to start to work with cakes. But all of these situations are also horribly awkward and a bit depressing (to me), which made it very hard for me to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAnother part of the comedy (the one I enjoyed more) comes from the metalinguistical references. Constantly, the protagonist speaks of other anime and their story in a more comical way. Also, it criticizes some genres of anime, for example: the anime made for the so-called \"moe pigs\".\\n\\n\r\nWataMote truly above average aspects are technical, however.\\n\\n\r\nIt is insanely pretty and knows how to use colors to express motions. The use of color is masterful, as is the use of other effects. Most of the time Tomoko is at school, the setting becomes black-and-white to portrayal her disconnect to that world, which is a fairly interesting characteristic.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also masterful. Tomoko's gruff and assured internal voice makes her sound like a complete badass, but, whenever she speaks up, we are reminded of her exterior: that of a lonely and small girl. This duality is only made possible because of the work of her voice actress, Izumi Kitta.\\n\\n\r\nWataMote's soundtrack and its usage is also top-notch. The tracks enhance the scenes in a fairly wonderful way and the usage of the OP is fairly interesting. The sound design as a whole is great, with some effects making the fails of Tomoko even more evident.\\n\\n\r\nWataMote was, to me, a mixed bag. With wonderful visual sense and great soundtrack, its \"literary\" aspects were severely lacking in comparison. Relatable and \"real-seeming\" characters were actually just one-sided empty shells. The comedy didn't work for me, I never laughed out loud during any of its 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWataMote is a strange comedy that focuses on the awkwardness. My recommendation is that you give the first episode a try: if you find it funny, continue watching and, if you don't, stop with no regrets, the rest is more-or-less the same.",

            "content": "First of all, even if the score is a 5, I don't wan't you to think that this is an \"average\" anime. This anime deserves the 5 for having really good pros to watch it, but also some awful flaws. It is funny at a time, then painful at the other. It can be really cute, then suddenly fall into creepyness. It can be hot then you're cold, you're yes then you're  no, you're in then you're out... (Katy Perry could certainly do a review of this). This is retard let's start this shit ffs.\r\nAs it is supposed to be a comedy, I'm goingto start talking about the lulz. Here it REAAALLY depends on your type of humor. The humor displayed in this show was pretty good if you are a goddamn masochist. I'm not saying that it was painfully bad, it was painfully funny. Gags were 70% awfully pitiful situations suffered by the main character Tomoko while trying too hard to socialize. This are funny...-ish, but also so fucking awkward that if you are not really similar to the main character (hence the \"relatability\" of the show\"), you will feel more sorry for Tomoko's bad luck than actually aroused by the gag. The other 30% were made up of the delusions created by Tomoko's crazy, uncivilized mind. Tomoko is introvert to such an extent that her delusions are out of this world, and honestly, I did laughed quite a lot with those.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the art, it was actually quite great and unique. Shades of grey and colors resembled perfectly Tomoko's feelings at moments, animation was constantly aboive the average and I find particularly original the cubist-ish deformation that Tomoko suffered when she was let down. Sound was pretty mediocre, but the rest of the art was great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's get into the main point of the series, aside for the humor: it's supposed \"relatability\". I was engaged to watch the anime due to the huge worship around Tomoko's character on the internet. People found it very relatable, and was waifu of many. I personally found the show WAY too exaggerated to ever be relatable to ANYONE, at least that I know. And I can tell you that I'm definitely not a popular guy, but hell, Tomoko was too much to handle.\\n\\n\r\nTomoko, as a character, although it has literally zero to negative evolution throughout the series, it's really interesting, but just an hyperbole of social anxiety. Time has passed too fast for her, and her egotistical though introvert attitude has made her not capable of establishing any new friendship with anybody in high school. What I definitely could see as the main point of the series (hence its title) is that Tomoko is constantly blaming on society for not paying attention to her and her superiority delusions. Her limited knowledge of human socializing and her days of gaming and watching anime have made her a \"solo player\", and dehumanized her to a point that she sees becoming popular as no more than a checkpoint on a video game, instead of considering that real life is an evergrowing \"final boss\" whose effects you can't control. Furthermore, the fact that makes the show much more suffering is that people are actually really kind to her. In reality, she would probably get bullied, but the fact that no one is coercing or bullying her, but just pitying on her and leaving her apart, makes it nearly impossible for Tomoko to blame anyone more than herself for her situation. However, no matter what, she keeps doing. Tomoko is quite of a horrible human being, but also a hopeless, defenceless one. Everyone would be like Tomoko under those conditions of social isolation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, who is to blame in this show? Tomoko? Society? Her parents or her brother? Her best elementary school friend Yuu-chan for being more popular than her? Imae-chan and Kii-chan for seeing her as a helpless stray dog? Probably everyone, or anybody at all. The fact is that this isn't anymore about the show. People like Tomoko exist in society nowadays, and the fact of leaving them apart is just as wrong as bullying them. Every human being deserves to be treated nicely at the least, but you know what? Let's get further from this point. Think about it the next time you are in school or in college when you see someone on their own for several days. Don't just be polite, but try befriending him or her just as you would do with any other person. Not being condescending, not being agressive, just being friendly. Maybe beneath that defensive armour of lonelyness you will find an awesome human being, forgotten by society long time ago, who may reveal it's own nature to its peers. Seriously, is that easy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you may love this show, you may absolutely hate it, but you should understand it's purpose besides comedy: to show the reality of a person with social anxiety, and to teach how NOT to deal with it.\\n",

It's painful, no matter if you like it or hate it.\r\nTo me, it was pretty funny at times, (and I think everyone agrees that the story with the massage-machine and the visual novel was hilarious) but at other times it was painful to watch Tomoko. To me, that pain made the comedy better, because as I imagined myself going through the same situations, I would feel extreme agony from the awkwardness, and if I was in that situation, I would pull out immediately and try to blend back into the norm. I can't imagine what lies at the end of the dark social pathsthat Tomoko often treads, and that makes the ends of those paths more enjoyable and funny to me. But I can definitely see the flip-side. You hate this show because it tortures Tomoko, who is similar to people in real life. So, I can't in good conscious recommend this anime to anyone, since it's pretty much a coin toss whether you like it or don't. Watch with caution.\\n\\n\r\nBut the art was beautiful. It used a pretty unique way to show lighting, using sharp contrasts rather than the usual soft blending. I thought that was pretty. And the opening song is agreed upon to be very good and representative of Tomoko's emotions. And Tomoko's voice is pretty well done.",

            "content": "Watamote, while daringly different from all of the anime out there that takes place in a high school setting, is alarmingly depressing. I never desired for the anime to suddenly slip into a positive, upbeat outlook and have Tomoko overtake the world, but there were times that I felt she was utterly pitiful and beyond help. Realistic enough. At least there aren't a bunch of busty, beautiful girls running around in short skirts, giggling, and falling in love with a vaguely attractive main character. That gets old.\r\nWatamote is blunt, and at times, painfully so. Tomoko is self-deprecating, but also motivated to become popular and well-likedby the boys and girls around her. She's so desperate that at some points, a simple greeting or farewell will make her (literally) salivate, and she whimpers about having not been \"molested\" on the train. That episode in itself made me want to stab myself, because of how triggering it had the potential to be for some people. No one in their right mind WANTS to be molested - but then, Tomoko isn't in her right mind. She's often portrayed as tired, with unkempt hair, dramatically different clothes from everyone else in her school (but don't they wear uniforms?), and desperate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo one, not even her family and friends, pay her any mind; though her brother does provide a sort of comic relief. He was entirely unfazed by her crap throughout the entire anime, to the point of typical sibling annoyance as she forced him to spend time with her. I think he was one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as downright sniffly as this anime could be, I kept watching it because I wanted to see her get better. By episode ten, she still hadn't, and there were only 12 episodes. I grew tired of it, but trudged on.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't necessarily say it was a good, mind-blowing anime, but it wasn't entirely too bad either. Some scenes were cringe worthy, some were full of depth and genuine emotion. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a give and take anime.",

This is extremely similar to Shakespeare's Sonnet 130. Some are over critical saying some charaters lack development, but that adds to the realism, ifall of the characters got development then it breaks the wall of Kuroki not knowing people until they are met. It's from Kuroki's perspective after all",

I just finished the series and I have to say WataMote is one of the best comedy anime Ive ever seen. \r\nThe story is about a high school girl which (as the title suggests) is quite unpopular but does not give up and constantly tries in her own funny way to escape that situation. While the actual story is pretty sad if you think about it, it is being presented with a unique sense of humor that instantly captivates you. Iwont say much more just try it its just 12 eps and every episode keeps you laughing out loud and makes you sceptical about some things at the same time. \\n\r\nDEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!!!",

            "content": "Welllllllllllll.....\r\nA show with a high quality main character with potential. That is good. But, it doesn't really take things anywhere. Less good.\r\nThis show has its moments. Its protagonist is definitely a character. But, hmm... for most of the show, I was only barely entertained for some reason! All episodes ranged from \"mild like\" to \"neutral.\" Which is odd, because... the main character is highly melodramatic (a good thing in my book). The show itself felt like it went nowhere, though; it's highly episodic. If the main character wasn't the way she was, this would have been immensely difficult to finish. \r\nI think that's my problemwith Watamote: I was felt neutral while watching it, with occasional enjoyment. It wasn't offensively bad nor very good, it just floated along, despite its harebrained main character. I laughed, but not often; I cringed, but not often (I'm looking to cringe, in a show like this). There's also little character development, so if you weren't laughing or cringing, there's just not much chew on.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's easy to become hyper-critical. There were reasons why I gave this show a 5 and not a 1. The intro and outro songs are quality. I enjoyed the creative artistic direction. The voice acting for the main character is excellent! (subbed, can't speak for dubbed) Fits the character perfectly, brings even more life to her, and its goofy delivery was responsible for most of my enjoyment. I chuckle just thinking about it sometimes. And while many of the comedic or potentially cringeworthy moments didn't get a laugh/cringe out of me for reasons I can't explain, there were a few here and there that did. I think the average viewer would find the show funnier and more cringeworthy than my experience. \\n\\n\r\nI have harsher tastes than the average viewer, so the odds are that you will like this show more than I did. While I enjoyed parts of it, I feel the MC deserved a better vehicle for character development than a mildly funny gag anime. I might give Watamote a rewatch down the road because I like its style, but I gotta say I'm disappointed I didn't like it as much as I expected to. It's not all bad and has its perks, and thing is, you'll know if the show's for you after 4 or 5 episodes, so despite my criticisms, it may be worth a try.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is about some issues that I'm personally very well acquainted with. Extreme social anxiety. Tomoko Kuroki is a not so average high school girl and to say that she struggles to talk to people is a huge understatement. We follow Tomoko through her various attempts at becoming popular and making friends. The hilarious reasoning behind the crazy things that she does in this anime are based on dating simulators which she loves to play. Let\u2019s just say\u2026dating simulators aren\u2019t the most accurate way to learn how to make friends!\r\nBe prepared to cringe, but also to laugh your heads off! To cope with herextreme loneliness, Tomoko envisions that the happy friends around her are actually miserable, superficial and attention seeking. Though she says this, whenever an opportunity to talk to these 'unworthy' people comes up, her voice gets all frail, whimpery and quiet and she makes very awkward jerky motions with her body. If the anime left it at that, it may not be so cringe inducing, but the unique lifestyle of filling her spare time with playing dating simulators has made Tomoko very strange.\\n\\n\r\nShe is desperate to have a romance like the ones in her video games, yet her social awkwardness has the opposite effect. She tends to sexualise random scenarios to set herself up for some very weird situations e.g. when a guy tried to swat away an ant from her arm, she freaked out and believed that it was due to her undeniable allure. \\n\\n\r\nThere are only a few characters in Watamote, since the spotlight is on Tomoko. We have her best friend turned trendy and popular \u2018Yuu chan\u2019 whom Tomoko both despises, wants to be\u2026and wants to be in a relationship with!? She feels some really weird attraction to either be like her and transform into a social butterfly and cling to the only friend she really has. Yuu is a bit dense though as she doesn\u2019t really realise that Tomoko is still so socially awkward and exactly how dependent she is on their childhood friendship. The fact that she still continues to be Tomoko\u2019s friend after she did some VERY strange and inappropriate things is heartwarming though!\\n\\n\r\nWe also have \u2018Ki chan,\u2019 a little girl that idolises Tomoko based on the cool stories she tells her about her fake social prowess. The lengths that Tomoko goes to keep up the facade that she is popular and trendy are insane, especially when she tries to give herself hickeys with a vacuum cleaner. One of the absolute highlights of the show. We have a cute helpful umbrella guy who appears later in the story and gets entangled in one of Tomoko's awkward situations. I wished that he had actually become a closer friend of hers, but he only featured briefly.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki, her brother doesn\u2019t really pay attention to her and stays away from her so that her weird doesn\u2019t rub off on him. The inability of Tomoko's mother to realise that her daughter was so lonely and that this was feeding her strange personality felt quite unrealistic. Though most of the reactions of Tomoko's class towards her weirdness felt pretty accurate, some of them seemed unrealistic also. Like they ignored her weirdness to an unbelievable degree! Imae is really the only one who shows up towards the end of the show who really shows any promise of actually becoming her friend. I was happy that they put some hopefulness amongst the social anxiety that is central to this show. \\n\\n\r\nThough there aren't many characters, Tomoko herself is such an entertaining protagonist, we don't really need them! From her weird fantasies where she envisions herself as some heroic desirable protagonist that everyone fawns over to her necessity to compensate for her lack of human interactions via interactions with cats, plushies and of course her hilarious dating games. Her fantasies and over exaggerations about the way that people are treating her are both hilarious and depressing at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nWatamote shows how your mind can either make your world appear like heaven or hell. Usually the things that seem like huge a social faux pas in reality are not that big of a deal. Our mind just tends to amplify the embarrassment. Tomoko\u2019s mind did this very thing to a huge degree that lead her to acting really strangely in public and then grieving about her loneliness after the cringeworthy encounter was over. When you have an unusual personality, I don\u2019t think Watamote is that far off in terms of the thoughts that run through your head and the crazy things you can do. Tomoko\u2019s ability to make everyone else responsible for her being lonely and out of place is something that\u2019s really easy to do and was captured really accurately in the show. Sometimes, when you can\u2019t deal with your own weirdness, you must project your frustration onto others. This anime does a phenomenal job at showing the whole strange and unrelenting nature of social anxiety and the consequences of not fitting normal societal expectations. Though some may be disappointed by the lack of progress in the ending, I feel like it did service to what the show was trying to portray\u2026resisting or changing your weirdness is much harder than embracing it and accepting that we are who we are.",

Socially awkward, shut-in, Otaku,only one friend (who lives in another country),not able torelate with other girls or anyone in general, Uncharismatic, clumsy, unlucky and plain looking. I doubt anyone with a social life will be able to understand this anime. But one of the great things I love about this is how I can actually relate to Tomoko and have actually said and thought (and even done) most of the things seen in the series. This anime is also very refreshing because of the realism of a sort. (i can't give examples or I'll spoil it). I like to think of this as Himouto Umaru-Chan! but more realistic with a more relatable protagonist. If you aren't sure whether to start this anime or not, I suggest you just watch the first episode and are able to relate to Tomoko. if it gets stale, then don't watch the whole series and complain it was a waste of time.",

As there are scenes of ridiculous when Tomoko act redundantly to make the audience laugh, occasional anime also slows the story, to show the other side Tomoko as someone ordinary girl is lonely, the more naturally able to invite the audience toempathize him, sympathize for failure efforts, and participate relieved when she found a little happiness. Amazingly, these changes, from fast to slow and from comedy to drama, it never feels too abrupt or awkward. There is always a gradual process of thinking to explain to the audience, to a certain extent, they are able to understand how Tomoko finallyarrive at a situation.",

            "content": "This anime feels like it had one very clear goal in what they wanted to portray and they accomplished that extremely well. How can we portray the life of a NEET introvert to be so unattractive that it forces people to want to live their high school lives better? Watamote depicts most of the cringiest moments of people's high school lives in such an obvious fashion that it makes the viewer look back at their own lives. \r\nThis show is a slice of life comedy following Tomoko Kuroki, a socially awkward first year in high school who has big plans to finally become popular inhigh school. The only problem is that her only knowledge about how to become popular comes from video games, manga, online forums and TV. Most of the things she tries are very hollow, superficial things that any cute, normal-ditzy girl could pull off in a cinch. However, they just make Tomoko seem creepy and give her more social anxiety and push her further away from her goal of becoming popular. If you love to see people fail and want to revel in awkward embarrassment, this show is for you.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, this show really accomplished what it wanted to, so well in fact, that it gets really hard to watch at times. Most shows have characters that do awkward or stupid things that don't work out, but those characters typically feign embarrassment and actually are self aware of what they're doing and it turns into irony. This is not the case in Watamote and every situation that Tomoko gets herself in is completely her fault and she bares the consequences in the worst ways imaginable. For me, this comedy became overbearing over time and I had to put the show down for a while. I don't think it helped that I binged 7 episodes in a day, but I think the point is still valid. I really liked the VA for Tomoko as she truly captured what I imagine a NEET introverted Japanese girl to sound like, which is not cute at all. The OP and ED are also very catchy in their own, very different ways. Another great thing thing show does is their references to other anime. They reference K-On, Haruhi Suzumiya, Evangelion among others and they all seem pretty on point in timing and comedic value. That being said, this show feels like it isn't for the new-comers in the anime community. I feel that having a larger knowledge of anime/Japanese culture helps appreciate the show for the viewer. I would only recommend this show to friends who have seen quite a bit of SoL anime and anime in general. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Watamote was pretty entertaining until I got burnt out on the premise which it achieves whole-heartedly. The middle felt like a chore to get through but it picks up in comedy towards the end. It's a cringefest and even though I feel like I was the intended audience (albeit not Japanese), I enjoyed it thoroughly but couldn't bear cringing anymore. 6/10",

The story was pretty average, but in a LeafyIsHere style, with lots of CRINGEY moments everywhere, but i liked it, kindo... 5/10. The art isnothing to brag about but it can be worse, way worse, it's good but nothing more, enough for you to understand everything 7/10. Sound, meh, this is not Angel Beats, or Gokukoku no Brynhildr, to say that is a master piece, but it's good 7/10. Characters besides Tomoko i really, didn't give anything for, but they where present, and made the story more enjoyable 7/10. Enjoyment, 11/10 would cringe again. Overall a good 7/10 from me. It's not your usual slice of life, and for me is a way to find m'self *tips fedora*, and for some people is very hard (That's what she said) to watch the anime because of the cringeyness, but i will happily recommend this anime to anyone who wants some fun , and some of my lifeu because no cringeu no lifeu, and no pico :).

The characters, especially Tomoki, is very relate able  if your a high school girl just trying her best to fit in....but also fail at almost everything she tries to do. Seeing her one and only friend Yuu come back from summer vacation and now going to a different high school then her acting a looking like a completely different person (someone thats likable in almost every way, but also whatshe would consider to be a \"popular\" person) sets Tomoki in a whirlwind of emotions and thoughts where she now thinks she has to be anything but what she is to be popular. \\n\\n\r\nAfter many, many failed attempts, spending time with Yuu, having long weird talks with her brothers and obsessing over random people who would talk to her, although  never giving up 100% Tomoki laughs about her problems and pretty sure learns to just accept the fact that she is, and probably always will be unpopular.",

            "content": "Social anxiety and awkwardness is something we can all pretty much relate to. Don\u2019t lie. You know you\u2019ve had your fair share of embarrassing moments, but, here, Tomoko takes social awkwardness to a whole different level \u2013 forcing us to relive those tragic bleak moments of our lives, while allowing us to laugh at ourselves too.\r\nWatamote, short for \u201cWatashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!,\u201d which roughly translates to No Matter How I Look at It, It\u2019s You Guys Fault I\u2019m Not Popular, is a rather self-explained title about a teenage girl just getting into high school, with deep social anxietyissues, and her delusional expectations of what a high school life should be like.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, the extremity of her awkwardness was mainly input for the sake of comedy and jokes. It\u2019s hard to say whether there are people like Tomoko because, unlike most people, Tomoko seems to lack the ability to read, or gauge, the feeling or mood of a social situation. Maybe her ignorance is due to her long-time isolation. Maybe instead of spending all that time watching anime and playing video games she should have spent it on extra-curricular activities. Or MAYBE, she\u2019s just fine the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I always thought high school kids were pretty weird to begin with. Or, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re weird, they just don\u2019t have a firm grasp of who they are yet (plus, we are more easily influenced at that age). It\u2019s just a part of growing up. We can either embrace our loneliness and awkwardness, or we can work to be a part of people\u2019s lives. It all depends on the person and how they see it, I guess. However, the story doesn\u2019t go out of its way to romanticize the idea that it gets better for Tomoko. If anything, her situation gets worse. But that\u2019s what makes it funny . . . and also very dull. It works for Watamote if you can accept that dark reality, but repetition gets boring. In my opinion, the comedy relieves its shortcomings a bit. Some jokes were gold, others didn\u2019t fully nail them, yet, her inner struggles were so sad I couldn\u2019t help but giggle, though I was mainly laughing at myself.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, her relationship with her family was probably my favorite aspect of the show and a subject that I would like to touch upon. A lot of viewers seemed to have a problem with Tomoko\u2019s parents\u2019 \u201cignorance\u201d and \u201cinsensitivity\u201d towards her social anxiety. I, on the other hand, found it pretty hilarious. Because if they\u2019re anything like my parents, they would have just brushed her off as crazy and made her do chores (which they do at some point) \u2013 the answer to everything, apparently. And, in a way, it\u2019s true how small accomplishments can go a long way to change our moods and minor depressions, similar to the way that exercise releases endorphins, which causes us to feel good, or happy. Unfortunately, being an otaku gets along with physical inactivity. However, I wouldn\u2019t take it personally if family members were to ever show that sort of \u201ccarelessness.\u201d It just means they have a different view on what they consider problematic and significant. When you think about it, social awkwardness is actually very insignificant compared to larger world problems and something that can be easily cured with constant human interaction. Plus, Tomoko is still a freshman. Her journey of self-discovery has only just begun, and it\u2019s a journey no one can take for her. Although, I doubt the author plans to stray away from the line of dark comedy anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Watamote is a \u201cdark\u201d comedy about a teenage girl, with very poor social skills, who is still struggling to find herself. The concept is really good, and I would recommend this series to anyone, though, I personally wasn\u2019t overly enthusiastic to watch it every week",

            "content": "-Warning Spoilers (Just a little)\r\nWatamote is about a girl who goes into high school thinking that she's going to be popular, thinking that she was cute. On the contrary she has all the makings to be a \"mojo\" which is an unpopular girl. This anime lured me in and I thought that after watching the trailer and the first episode, it was going to be a very enjoyable series. But as I continued with the series, I realized that there was no progress. With every lesson she only learned that she couldn't be a cute girl and she didn't become one in the end. Thoughthis anime brought be a few laughs, it was the same thing every episode. If your looking for an anime to watch while your passing the time, it's good for that. But, if you want to actually sit down and try to understand whatever your watching, just pass by this one.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is kind of like an average life of a shut in who is trying to become popular. Nothing special about it. I felt as if there needed to be some sort of expansion rather than the protagonist staying in her shell the ENTIRE anime. To put it in a short term, the anime didn't go anywhere. Though it was somewhat funny and had a good idea to it, it didn't expand from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was mediocre. I wouldn't say it was horrible but it didn't draw me in either. Though it did a good job of describing what the characters were like, it kind of disturbed me. The main protagonist and her brother both have weird bags under their eyes and it made me cringe every time that I saw them. Though there might be people who enjoy it, I particularly don't.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the sound is the only thing that I could actually vouch for in this anime. The beginning and ending songs were pretty great. It expanded on the character and her emotions, anger, frustration, cheerfulness, and just being a high schooler. I think that the music really brought the anime to life. Although it did scare me the first time... ^-^;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOkay let's get down to it. There were a nice mix of characters in this anime and I think that they could've complimented each other very well, but they did a par job.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, I didn't particularly HATE the protagonist. I liked the idea of a high school mojo who wanted to become popular girl. Kuroki Tomoko is shy and is completely unable to talk or interact with people. She strives to become popular, have a boyfriend, and such. But, all that she knows is from animes and boy gameplays. I think that I might have been a bit biased about this character because she reminded me about me^^. Sometimes, she gets angry and goes on about killing people that are ignorant and such for stealing her umbrella, but for some reason she bursts into tears when she falls off a high chair. Tomoko doesn't enjoy school because she can't interact with people and she feels jealousy and anger towards popular people. This character didn't expand from this point, in the end she didn't change or develop. On a whole, though I liked this character, I wished that she moved on from learning from animes and actually talked to people.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki Kuroki--- Not much to say about this character. He's a normal high school student, average amount of friends, average looks, and average amount of girls who like him. He has the same bags underneath his eyes as Tomoko has and they seem pretty close to talk back to each other all the time. The feuds between them are pretty funny at times. He gets my stamp of approval for being so goddamn normal.\\n\\n\r\nYu Narase--- An old best friend of Tomoko. It seems she was very quiet and reserved when she was in middle school and they split for high school. They meet to hang out one day and shes become very kawaii^^. I really enjoyed this character because I loved how she clashed with Tomoko's character. Yu is cute, out going, and everything that Tomoko wants to be. \\n\\n\r\nThere probably was more development in the series but I did watch from episode 1 to 6. From what I saw, it wasn't going anywhere. If you want to pass time, go on ahead but if your looking for an anime to cherish... This Watamote isn't your anime. Overall I give it a solid 6.5, for being funny, dark, boring, and entertaining... All at the same goddamn time. \\n\\n\r\n-ChunsaChan",

I know that I'm a fan of CGDGT but at least those anime have some substance to them whether it be story or interesting characters but Wattamote doesn't have that. Your enjoyment of the show is purely based off of how you enjoy the main character Tomoko Kuroki and if you don't you might as well just drop the show and don't waste your time like I did. Tomoko's personality is an otakugamer that can't talk to people at all but she also bounced around other characters like her brother Tomoki and her childhood friend Yuu Naruse but it doesn't go anywhere and the comedy just doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, voice acting and music aren't speculator but they aren't bad. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you stay away from this anime, it's really nothing special and there's so many better SoL comedies.",

I felt almost like we were back at the beginning.
