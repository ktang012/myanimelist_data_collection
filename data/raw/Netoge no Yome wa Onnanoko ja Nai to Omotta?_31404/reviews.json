            "content": "Oh, great. Another light novel adaptation with a harem, a stupidly long title that nobody in their right mind would want to pronounce, and a story revolving around MMOs. The anime industry clearly hasn't had enough of those. \r\nIt would be one thing if Netoge was just more run-of-the-mill mediocrity, but it instead goes all the way in being silly tripe. This is an anime where the protagonist's entire set of friends in an online game just so happen to be attractive (in some cases, popular) girls who, conveniently, attend the exact same high school and know him personally, including a twintailed tsundere and hisin-game waifu who immediately clings all over him and proclaims herself his wife, despite not actually knowing anything about who he is in the real-world. If you were to drop the show immediately after the first episode, I would not blame you, and I would actually suggest you are making the right choice. It certainly does not do anything in the later episodes to convince otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nFor what is supposed to be an anime involving romance, said 'romance' is about as shallow and as juvenile as it can possibly get. They love each other over a video game. A game! This is not love--- it is two mentally troubled and lonely children infatuated with one another because they share a superficial hobby and because they cannot get anyone better. Anyone who has dated before, especially at a young age, knows that desperate relationships like these never go anywhere. And the two of them like to imagine themselves a married couple? Really? Marriage is not play-time-- it requires a great deal of compromise and sacrifice, and would crush their childish fantasy as a result. A couple like this would not last more than a few weeks in reality, much less a lifetime. So forgive me if I do not care when the show tries to make me feel for them (and often, unfortunately, it does). \\n\\n\r\nAnything that comes out of Ako's mouth is a pain to the senses. She claims real-life is a kusoge and compares luck to item drops in a game. Even the most extreme of otaku on 2ch and other places have the sense to treat these sorts of comments as a joke. That Ako is completely serious about it makes it quite clear that she is a basket-case and that the show has no interest in painting her as an actual person. She is a collection of silly tropes to throw on a body pillow and sell to otaku. At least something like Oreimo, as painful a show as it often was, actually made an effort to make its characters something more than that. \\n\\n\r\nOn numerous occasions, Ako makes it clear that she is a terrible girlfriend who has no right dating anyone. She even goes as far as to lie about meeting up with another dude to get back at the protagonist and make him jealous. Anybody, whether male or female, who thinks this is acceptable behaviour is, frankly, scum. He should have dumped her right then and there. But he didn't, and he won't, because this is a harem anime, and harem anime do not care for their characters behaving like sensible human beings. \\n\\n\r\nNetoge isn't all too interested in making the other girls (and there are a whole four of them) feel like they actually have a place in the story. They could just as easily be taken out of the show entirely without it affecting all that much. They exist primarily as eye-candy, showing up, for example, in a vapid 'beach episode', where they join Ako, swimsuits and all, in lathering the protagonist with sunscreen. Netoge doesn't really have any idea of whether it wants to commit solely to Ako or fully embrace the harem route, and often it will switch directions one or more times per episode. They encourage the protagonist and his relationship with Ako, and then the next moment they'll be rubbing their breasts against him or blushing in some pseudo-confession scene. Why? For what purpose?\\n\\n\r\n(It also goes without saying that Netoge, given its genre, is ripe with unnecessary fanservice. The girls will all bath together, making vaguely homosexual comments about each other and comparing their breast sizes, with huge amounts of steam covering their bodies so that otaku will be manipulated into buying the uncensored BluRay version. How many more years will it take until the anime industry matures beyond this?)\\n\\n\r\nEvery male besides the protagonist is depicted as a horrible loser with no hope of finding love. His group of male friends (who, by the way, were even less of an otaku than him) do nothing but envy his apparent success with the ladies, despite him being entirely bland and average and without anything that would make the opposite sex interested in him. The protagonist is the single most important character in a story, and here he is the least interesting. I get it-- the girls need to be cute in a harem series, and so they might take a higher priority, but that is still no excuse for making the protagonist a lifeless sack of nothing. I suppose the one thing that can be said in his favour is that he isn't entirely dense like most other protagonists in the genre, and actually makes an effort to go out and get things done. He could be worse-- he could be, say, Ichika from Infinite Stratos.  \\n\\n\r\nNetoge tries to go for a similar art style to No Game No Life, with its blue-coloured outlines, although, quite thankfully, it does not try to assault the eyeballs nearly as much as did NGNL and its excessively bright colours. Interestingly, Netoge shows the MMO gameplay from both the player's perspective (with sprites similar to Ragnarok Online) and from some sort of fantasy (a la Sword Art Online) presumably going on in their heads. If it truly wanted to appeal to the audience's nostalgia for these sorts of games, it could have done without the latter. We don't need to see random online girls having their boobs bouncing against the protagonist's arm. The real-world side of the story already has enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nUnless another lame harem anime is something you absolutely need in your life, Netoge is something to be avoided. It is completely manufactured, playing the genre trope for trope in order to manipulate a few poor souls into paying money for it. You're better than that. You deserve better than something like this. Heck, anime deserves better.\\n\\n\r\nIn a few weeks' time, nobody will even remember Netoge. The next generic light novel harem will roll around, as always it does, season after season. Will anime fans ever get sick of them? Perhaps. But I sure don't want to sit around and wait.",

            "content": "There are some series that leaves an impact on the consumer, whether positive or negative, influencing or degrading, enjoyable or painful. They fall into a specific spectrum of very good or very bad. But then there are the in-betweeners, some which have good qualities but still missed their mark more times than acceptable, or are of the \u201cso bad, it's good\u201d due to managing to hold on to some charm that saves it from the trash bin. Others, however, manage to find comfort in the very middle by just \u201cbeing there\u201d, not picking a side and not making an impression good or bad enough tobe properly labeled at a glance. These get glossed over easily enough that one would really have to be paying attention or actively looking to notice them.\\n\\n\r\nSuch is the case of \u201cNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?\u201d, \u201cAnd You Thought There is Never a Girl Online?\u201d, simply shortened to \u201cNetoYome\u201d. It's your typical \u201chigh school ecchi romance comedy light novel\u201d adaptation, fit for its particular audience that picks it up every season and manages to enjoy them despite the problems that plague the genre. And yet at the same time, it's one of the more tolerable ones. There is nothing infuriating about it while still not being special enough to fully stand out from its fellow ecchi light novel crowd. You could say it's the wallflower of ecchi light novel anime, the one you notice at the corner of your eye, yet aren't willing to ask for a dance. Well, maybe this time, you can make an exception to try just once, or at least give a wave to acknowledge its presence and make it feel more welcome.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Hideki Nishimura is a regular in the MMORPG called \u201cLegendary Age\u201d as a knight named in-game \u201cRusian\u201d, and has been in a few guilds during his play-through. In one such guild, he came to like a particular player and confessed his love for that character in-game and asked to marry them. The player behind the character revealed she's actually a he in real life, and out of shock, he vowed to never trust another female character in-game again. But it doesn't stop him from meeting a new character, a cleric by the name of \u201cAko\u201d, and after a bit of inner conflict with himself, they marry in-game. One day, as suggested by the guild leader, the Alley Cats decide to have a meet-up in real life, revealing much to his surprise\u2014and near-disbelief\u2014all three of his party members (two of which are male characters) are girls who go to the same high school. And as it turns out, Ako truly is Ako (full name Ako Tamaki), and she has fallen in love with him like she did in the game\u2014if only because she can't differentiate between online fantasy and reality. Thus, Hideki, the tsundere Akane \u201cSchwein\u201d Segawa, and the student council president Kyou \u201cApricot\u201d Goshouin work together to help her out by forming a club while the two in-game lovebirds find themselves growing just as close in real life.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a simple premise, there's nothing more to it than what is listed in the paragraph. You do get character interactions with each other both in the game and in real life (to show their online counterparts aren't too different from their actual personalities), but that's as deep as it goes, even when occurring characters come in-and-out as they please (and showing a strange male-to-female gamer ratio in-series, but whatever). It's a romance, and a sweet romance at that, which for an ecchi rom-com light novel adaptation, it's to be expected, and it knows it's nothing more than that. And yet because it's simple and sweet, there's a special charm to it that makes it refreshing for the genre. In fact, despite being an ecchi, it's not your standard ecchi fare of \u201cmain male protagonist and his harem get into sexual slapstick mishaps with cheesecake shots for the camera\u201d. The closest it ever got to this was in the obligatory beach episode, but the roles were actually switched. It was just the characters having fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real conflict throughout the series is Ako's inability to tell apart online fantasy with the real world, but there was an episode dedicated to a hacker infiltrating Hideki's account that caused a temporary rift between him and Ako while also practically deleting his character and selling all of his inventory for a quick buck. The character of Rusian does get restored, but not with his items, so for the rest of the series afterwards, there's brief discussions about such-and-such item still being missing, Rusian and Ako remarry, and the hacker gets confronted in a strangely amusing but admittedly smart way, then that's about it for the hacker subplot. \\n\\n\r\nIf there had to be a problem with the story itself, it's that Hideki's trouble with trusting girls online, which is what kickstarted the anime, goes away pretty early on when he comes to terms that not everyone's what they seem to be behind the keyboard. So he doesn't show too many trust issues throughout the series as originally believed, which may or may not be a good sign depending on what you were expecting to happen. It's not like with \u201cGirls Bravo\u201d in which the main protagonist is allergic to girls, so there's no jokes at his dispense over it during and after. Akane more-or-less is the only one who really pushes his buttons, but that's because she developed a reputation as being the popular beauty who turns down every guy who asks her out despite being bit of an alpha bitch (more-or-less to hide the fact she's a gamer), so she has to keep that title in the school.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Personal opinion here, but Ako is one of the most precious, if not adorable characters this season, albeit in personality and design. Sure, there's always that possibility her na\u00efvet\u00e9 will get on people's nerves (and given how mo\u00e9 she is, that's to be expected), but there's something innocent and a little sweet about the way she views her relationship with Hideki. She truly loves him even though she sees him as \u201cRusian\u201d and calls him as such much to his chagrin, and the other characters are concerned enough about her lack of social life that they want to help her overcome it. And the odd thing is she's a very pretty girl, one would think she'd be popular with the boys in school. But she's not. No one gives her the time of day because she's painfully timid and probably doesn't take great care of herself at times. She's Tomoko's sweeter twin sister who's inexperienced with video games, if you want a comparison.\\n\\n\r\nHideki is your typical male protagonist in that he's the nice guy with no real distinct personality to call his own, especially since he's quite the otaku so his friends at school tease him about. He shows genuine care for his guild (which extends into real life the best they can), but especially for Ako since she's the newbie of the group. And yet, there's something charming about him. By himself, he's just there, but together with Ako, they form a nice dynamic that allows him to shine a little brighter than he could've. It's not the best way to write a character, however, the relationship is definitely there and cannot be overlooked without forsaking the lifeblood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kyou are of their respective archetypes for the most part, but they work fine together with Hideki and Ako and thus that keeps them from being the \u201cslightly more than a background character\u201d characters. Kyou's the guild leader (reflecting her status as student council president as well as a rich girl), so she's the most level-headed of the group, but she has her moments as well. Akane's sharp attitude causes some bickering here and there between her and Hideki, but as the tsundere, it's to be expected, and since there's no romance between them, it's for good fun. She's pretty much their ace in the guild despite Hideki having some of the best items, and is usually the first to go into battle.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters show up, but Nekohime and Sette are more-or-less the only recurring characters. There's honestly nothing more to these characters than what they're introduced as even after becoming regular members of the Alley Cat guild, but there's an actual funny punchline behind Nekohime's identity, at least if you're not paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: Of all the shows I personally watched this season, \u201cNetoYome\u201d is one of those shows with a distinct art-style that makes characters pop in their beauty and attractiveness (even with the occasional bounciness of the girls not Akane, though she makes up for it with leg shots). Not entirely sure how much of Hisasi's influence there is in the anime, but Akane Yano knew what to do as the character designer. It's a very colorful, pretty show to look at, and I hadn't noticed too many quality dips during its run. Colors also have different palettes for the real world and the online world. There's more color to the real world than in-game where it's more gray and saturated, but that's probably because most of what we see in-game are the characters in the dungeon or in a pub where they hold their meetings. Not that the game itself doesn't have color, when the characters are out in a field or in the village, it is bright and there's like a rainbow filter in the backgrounds, but it's noticeably not the real world. The tone also changes much more in-game than in the real world, where everything's calm and normal, if only because other guilds tend to drop by and pick fights with Rusian when they're not battling a boss (which aren't of bad quality themselves). \\n\\n\r\nI'm not one of those folks that goes around proclaiming \u201cthis cinnamon roll is too good for this earth\u201d or \u201cI want to protect that smile\u201d, but I can make an exception for the latter because holy crap these characters have lips and they have adorable smiles that makes the eyes look sparklier than usual (which says something since they have rather sparkly eyes to begin with). Protect that smile at all costs, it's too precious for any other show but this one.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Admittedly, I haven't paid too much attention to this, so this'll be short. There is a FUNimation dub currently streaming, but I haven't yet listened to it to really give thoughts on. The original is fine if you ask me, but there's nothing too special or note-worthy outside of Rina Hidaka as Ako. She knows how to make the soft-spoken character adorable, and thus her voice stands out the most in this show. Everyone else is fine, I have nothing against them. As for the music, the soundtrack doesn't really stick out to me that much outside of violins, bells/chimes, and electronic beeps, but it's not bad. The OP is sugary-sweet in setting the tone of the \u201c1st Love Story\u201d, and the ending has some nice, calming beeping effects in the music I actually like. I may never remember the name of the song, but I could most definitely pinpoint it to this series since those notes give off this \u201cInternet\u201d feel.\\n\\n\r\nBut I must point out that in the MMO world, swear words when spoken are censored with oinking sound-effects, which is pretty funny. I thought it was because of the \u201cSchwein\u201d character, but it affects all of the characters even though Akane swears the most.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \u201c[Don't] Judge a book by its cover\u201d is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, but there's a lot of truth to it while there's plenty of exceptions. I don't know what exactly it was about \u201cNetoYome\u201d that I was interested in from the start, but most likely it was the attractive art, and I had no other expectations for it. I'm just as skeptical about the light novel adaptations as the next person, especially as I haven't had too many good times with a lot of them (the last ecchi rom-com light novel adaptation I had watched peeved me off, after all). This isn't even my favorite show of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet somehow, it wormed its way into my heart and made itself comfortable. It's too endearing to bother asking it \u201cYo, why're you here?\u201d, so I just let it be, and I've grown content with its company. It'll probably leave at some point down the road, but I see it sticking around for a little bit or going off to join the likes of \u201cMy Dear Marie\u201d, \u201cGingitsune\u201d, and \u201cDenki-gai no Honya-san\u201d in the \u201cSomehow I Liked This Enough to Acknowledge Its Existence a Bit More Regularly Than I Technically Should've\u201d corner. Either way, I definitely wouldn't mind a second season if they choose to do so. I'd like to see Ako become more socially active and further develop her relationship with Hideki, since it's not too often you get an anime couple willing to develop and grow together prior to the third act of a series.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, really, protect that smile. Go ask that darling Ako for a dance and make her feel loved and welcome. Wallflowers are beautiful when they finally open up.",

            "content": "When first saw this anime on a Facebook clip, I thought, \"Hmm, looks like another SAO, ill watch it when I have time.\" Now fast forward like 5 weeks, I had time to watch. After seeing the first 3 episodes this instantly became my favorite anime of this season. Not only was there extremely relateable MMORPG references, there was so many jokes made for the avid MMORPG Player who has no social life. \r\nStory 10/10: Because i have 0 experience with love, and this anime is basically a love story, i can say, its basically the most perfect romance ever. Like meeting a girl thrua game and then having a relation irl? Maaan, i only could WISH that happens to me. Thru my eyes, this is the most ideal and perfect love story ever.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: They do well with the fight scenes, lots of bright scenes that are done quite well and darker scenes that transition smoothly. There is a slight vary of character art styles but it looks similar enough and still very well, especially Ako's.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I can't say the intro and the outro are amazing, but the anime it self does not repeat much sounds. The music that plays when the characters are about to do a dungeon raid in game is pretty good, others are just \"ok.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Lets start with the obvious. Ako Tamaki is my waifu now because of her character. Moving on with the other female characters. Theres a few others and the anime seems to explore their character as well, you start to find them all quite likeable. Now the male mc. In most anime, when i see a male mc doing well with girls, i usually cringe kinda hard and start to hate them. In this anime tho, the male is quite likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Well lets see, after being mc-kun in my own story that took place in Runescape, seeing someone else perfectly replay my story is quite the enjoyment. Most \"funny\" anime put a small smile to my face, this literally can make me laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I'm going to start playing mmos again and try to live mc-kun's life now.",

            "content": "Netoge is the type of show where it\u2019s pretty much every school, game tropes, and roleplay coming together in one package. The English title is \u201cAnd you thought there is never a girl online?\u201d The first thought that popped into my head reminds me of the second season of Sword Art Online. To sum it easily, it\u2019s a show that blends fantasy and reality. From the real life perspective that shifts into the MMO world, Netoge is probably a show you\u2019ll enjoy if you\u2019re familiar with storytelling related to such themes. Otherwise, this could just be another blend LN adapted series that serves no morethan eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the show should be taken more as a comedy, almost like a type of satire. Because let\u2019s face it, the show itself isn\u2019t based on characters playing as saviors to defeat some overlord or escape after being trapped in some alternate world. The main character Hideki Nishimura goes by his in-game name \u201cRusian\u201d and apparently finds out that his wife from an online game (Legendary Age) is also a girl in real life. Take this further and soon, he realizes that all the guild members are classmates from the real world. And they are all girls! I think this ties back a bit where Rusian needs to reevaluate about what he learned. Luckily, Rusian\u2019s classmates accepts him as who he is because like him, they are also gamers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one particular gamer seems to have difficulty of differentiating between fiction and reality. Meet Ako Tamaki, the girl that proposed to Rusian and now is technically his in-game wife. The problem is that she takes that idea too far and also considers Rusian her husband from BOTH worlds. Most of the comedy comes to reality when misunderstanding develops between the duo. Because let\u2019s face it, these kids are still in high school and getting married at their age is almost unbelievable. Plus, Ako has somewhat of an obsession toward Rusian, like the way a clingy wife does when they are lonely. Judging on Ako\u2019s character alone, she genuinely seems like a kind person with a bit of an airhead-like behavior and lack of common sense. Perhaps she spends too much time online and her ideas about relationships reinforces that. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the majority of the relationships focuses on Ako and Rusian, there are times when other girls step in to show their knowledge about gaming and real life. Characters such as Akane often tries to get Ako to be more herself rather than an in-game character. Kyo Goshuin, the leader of the Alley Cat guild (also student council president) plays the role of a commanding leader. As such, she often serves a big sister to the other characters and bears a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. But needless to say, these characters are still one dimensional. Ako gets jealous like most wives tends to do when other girls are flirting with their \u201chusbands\u201d, Akane is the classic tsundere, and Kyo is pretty much a walking billboard of fan service in-game. Rusian is perhaps the only normal character with some common sense. Despite that, he still get dragged into various affairs whether he likes it or not.\\n\\n\r\nA portion of the enjoyment coming from the show is the humor. The story itself isn\u2019t well written as it mostly focuses on the life styles of these gamers but the comedy can be quite fun once you get sucked into it. What does that mean? It generally means try watching the show with an open mind. Every episode mixes in a variety of ideas from gameplay mechanics, relationship dynamics, and sometimes nonsense that transforms into absurd humor. While the show\u2019s story lacks on most parts to explore relationships, it does give a decent meaning to Ako and Rusian. The duo accepts each other more and more throughout the story and in one episode, Ako\u2019s trust towards Rusian is proven after a malicious incident. This is characterized by Rusian accepting Ako for who she is (both in-game and out in the real world). The reality is that Ako is a timid girl and Rusian may be the first person to be honest about what he likes in her. While the couple is silly to watch, there is a genuine heartwarming feeling about them as well.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, I think the show overemphasizes on their relationship with minimal characterization about the others. Nearly every episode shows Ako getting girly with Rusian. She even has yandere-like moments when another girl approached Rusian. Akane\u2019s role in the series can be rather annoying to watch as she constantly denies about her gaming lifestyle from the public. At some point, those scenes feels like it\u2019s taking on TV time. The only tolerable female character out of the group may be Kyou (Apricot) She even sets up a club to unite gamers and tries to help Ako connect with reality. Unfortunately, her role in the show (particular when in-game) shows she\u2019s more of an eye candy rather than a role model. \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the artwork of the show. When I first found out that the original source was drawn by an H-artist (Hisasi), I was already rolling my eyes. While the anime is tamer than the light novel, the series still has fan service. The prominent example is the in-game design for Kyou where she wears little clothing to cover herself. Ako isn\u2019t far off as there are times when she\u2019s goes full nude because of her lack of common sense. There\u2019s also the classic beach episode with skimpy swimsuits. In one particular scene, Rusian gets hounded by three girls at once to help him \u201cput the lotion on\u201d. Artistic wise, the show is fairly average in terms of quality. Nothing too impressive but also not atrocious either. The in-game character designs are perhaps what stands out the most while their real life counterparts is nothing special.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is one of the lesser noticeable parts of the show. The OP and ED theme songs does characterize what this show is about on paper. Character voice mannerism is moderate although listening to Ako\u2019s voice makes her sound like a child on most occasions. Akane\u2019s tsunder personality is clearly evident in her voice as well. There are also some occasionally sad and heartwarming moments with a surprisingly decent soundtrack to bring it together.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished this show, I pretty much thought \u201cok\u201d. Because quite honestly, I think this show is fine as it is. If it stretched more, it\u2019ll feel dragged and quickly gets old while rushing isn\u2019t doing the source any favor. Ako and Rusian\u2019s relationship can be a mixed bag for most viewers where at times, they can be really fun to watch while other times feels like it\u2019s a chore. But in retrospect, Netoge is what it is, with nothing great but also not so easily forgettable either.\\n",

            "content": "Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta had a very interesting concept, plot, story and more importantly nice cast of characters. \r\nI think what I liked most about this title, the story specifically, is that no matter what episode I was watching I always had some sort of sense of enjoyment. Seeing the characters progress through certain events both inside and outside the game. I think that character development & growth was a big part of the story due to each character having some sort of social problem however, I'd like to discuss this more in the character department rather than story. \r\nSuddenplot development and story development, I felt like the way both were introduced came off as weak and somewhat uninteresting.. The lack of exciting new developments in the shows story-line actually made me less excited to watch new episodes. The drama along with new issues in certain episodes could have been resolved within a few minutes maybe the first 11 minutes of a 23 or 24 minute episode. This however was not the case and because of that a majority of the problems that the characters had made it feel like some episodes were slow and boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt looks pretty great. Special effects looked great when used properly and the overall character designs were fantastic. I can tell that the producers and animators were going for the moe look with the girls because they gave them bigger eyes and tiny lips. \tPersonally I think that this was a very smart idea, especially for the character Ako since she's like the main female character. The producers knew that we were going to be seeing Ako the most, so why not make her look even more appealing. All of that aside costumes, daily outfits all looked alright to me. The only issue I had was the show was really bright. \\n\\n\r\nI used three different methods of watching Netoge. I tried using my samsung 48 inch 4K Smart TV and the results just weren't that great so I tried using my computer monitor on \"Economic\" so it could dim down the brightness. Lastly I tried using my 42 Vizio TV and just didn't get the results I was hoping for. In the end though, I just had to deal with the strange brightness in the show.Other than that, the art and animation was pretty great. \\n\\n\r\nOh the soundtrack. I honestly didn't care too much for the soundtrack. The background music just lacked intensity and sometimes it felt dull. The ending song was the only song I liked. I felt that it imagined a better picture of the romance between Ako and Rus was all about!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters stood-out in a good way! In my opinion, the shows biggest working department is character development. As I mentioned earlier I believe that character development was much more important than actual story and plot in Netoge. This is because just about every episode focused more about certain characters issues... you know who I am talking about (cough Ako.. cough..) and how that said person is going to grow from it.\\n\r\nLastly, the girls were super cute & adorable and Hideki was a pretty decent main character.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall feelings and enjoyment for the title were a little above average. I loved the fan-service, I liked the characters, and the story was engaging. There was a considerable amount of action that kept the story exciting. The character development kept the show refreshing and the special effects were great!\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? deserves its 8/10 for introducing such a creative story as well as nice characters.\\n",

Now a week later I can say that this show has become one of my all-time favourites. \r\nNow I'll be the first to admit that this show does heavily follow cliches of it's genre, but really thats not an entirely bad thing as it does those cliches very well. From the characters to the story, even if I had seen it before somewhere else, this show just does it better. That said even when the storydoes cliches well, it's still not that strong and if you want a good story, don't come looking here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters though, that is where the show shines like a diamond. The characters despite a few being cliche, are all incredibly enjoyable and fun. Ako, the main girl is probably one of the most adorable and endearing characters in any anime I've ever seen. This same general sentiment can be applied to all major characters, they're endearing and they grow on you to the point of loving them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of this show is yet another thing I love about it.All the characters and backgrounds look good. This animation coupled with the good sound design go a long way to tell me that there was actual effort put into this show. \\n\\n\r\nI love this show.",

            "content": "Here we are, another Robert's Too Late Review coming right for your brain! Today we are going to step into the world of Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? Or 'And You Thought There Was Never a Girl Online?' for us thick-tongued people. Goes without saying to read the synopsis, minor spoilers, so forth, but a couple of other things should be noted as well: I am running the dub version, and I have NOT seen more than a few episodes of Sword Art Online. From what I gather from friends and other sources, there is a lot of comparisons between animethat have the whole 'gamer' angle and SAO. So without that experience, or having seen any other video game based show, I will be reporting from 'virgin' eyes I guess you could say. \\n\\n\r\nI've been a gamer a very long time. I remember playing Space Invaders and Cosmic Ark on the Atari 2600. I was young, but there when Mario became super for the first time. Back when the word 'Nintendo' was synonymous with all video gaming. I'm still a huge gamer, I have Doom (2016) getting a Steam update as I write this, and have spent time in the Final Fantasy series in the past 24 hours. I point this out to give you insight about where I'm coming from, as a viewer. Let's get to how the story is impacted by what a person might know, or not know, in relation to gaming. Also we have to see if anyone in the series deserves a spot beside Tifa Lockhart on the RTLR wall of girls!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe main thrust is a kind of overused one in my mind because the idea of having to draw someone away from the internet, and gaming in general, was a HUGE deal when I was a teen back in the '90's. Parents everywhere were afraid their children were becoming zombies by playing too much. We were constantly inundated with messages about the (give me a spooky sounding voice here) dangers of video game addiction! It was so bad that at one point when the first ISP opened in my hometown, they actually refused an unmetered connection. Not because they didn't have the equipment or tech to allow it, but because the owner felt it was his personal duty to defend the purity and innocence of the town at large. Can't have everyone running around playing Doom (original) all night long! He even once bragged to me about monitoring the network so closely that he would kick people off if he felt they 'needed it'. So yeah, I know all about the whole 'game addiction' thing. I'm not going to argue about if its as widespread as some say or anything political like that. I'm just saying, yeah, I've heard just a few times about how people can 'lose themselves' to the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue then becomes, this is kind of what the anime is all about, helping a young girl who is more socially active and outgoing as her character in an MMO game than she is in her incredibly anxiety and shyness-filled real life. So why would I even watch this series? I tell ya, I have very few reviews on here that are negative. I was ready to watch this show and beat the ever living hell out of it for being stereotypical and asinine. But then, the first gaming joke dropped, and I laughed. Then an old school reference popped up, bringing back memories of games past, and I was suddenly hooked. The sly (and sometimes blatant) little nods to the gaming community and in-jokes and such were fun to look for, and the story is a lot lighter than I expected. \\n\\n\r\nI remember back in the days of AIM and ICQ ruling the interwebs long before anyone took an arrow to the knee, and I can recall chatting people up and getting little crushes on them before realizing that back then, the banner across the gateway to the internet didn't say \"FACEBOOK GOOD\" instead it said \"Welcome to the internet where men are men, women are men, and children are undercover cops.\" So finding out someone you thought was totally your type of girl was actually a burly man old enough to be your father was a common experience. I remember too, as the show references, how badly you beat up the asshole who shot around indiscriminately when 'cleric needs food BADLY!' These kinds of nods and such were great, even if the story is a harem anime dressed in game trappings. \\n\\n\r\nThe gang don't just work to pull the young girl out of the game, they all learn to balance their lives in meaningful ways, while having fun ribbing each other over different things, just like friends do. And that's the point of it all, really, is that they all became friends, not only in game, but in life as well.  As I said, this is a harem show, at least in the sense that there is only one guy basically anywhere to be seen, and the rest of the cast is female. Now the young gamer girl is 'married' to the guy in the game world, and seems to extend that view to the real world as well, so she's totally harem type material. There's another who is played by the wonderful voice actress Jad Saxton (of Koneko from DxD fame) who is, of course, very standoffish. A few more girls and even a teacher round out the group, though we don't focus as much on romance in any meaningful manner than we do to the more comedic stylings. And unlike many harem type shows, only young Ako seems to be attracted in any manner to the main guy. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we get is a cut between the group doing real life things to either help young Ako come out of her shell, or to build a stronger bond between them all as guild members in game, or they play and do things like help newbies and engage in player-versus-player action. The main guy does develop feelings for the young girl Ako, but we never see a real resolution to the relationship, at least not in a satisfying actual in the real world kind of way. Ako dotes on her 'husband' even in real life, but even after the guy confesses to her, we don't see any kind of romantic bloom happen. And one would think it would be easy, as Ako is VERY devoted as the in-game 'wife'. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is fun, and full of references to gaming in general, and some of them are on the older side of things which makes them really fun for us older gamers (and younger retro players too). The Konami Code even makes an appearance, and I was waiting for Leroy Jenkins to run by shouting about to whose bases are belonging to. But overall, we're looking at a series that strives to show that life isn't all about gaming, but it's not all about sports, or grades, or hobbies, or even anime (quit throwing things at me!) but instead it's about all the things we love in our lives, and how we can come together and learn and build friendships we didn't even think was possible. The high school nerd and the snotty teen queen can share experiences and actually come kind of close to being friends! A often repeated line is \"Real life and the game are totally separate!\" But in the end, they're not. Not really. Everything about you makes you who you are, not just one interest or hobby or talent. Everything. And if we can learn to see each other as people and not as just these narrow definitions, then the world could become a better place. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI loved the art in this one! Ako is so kawaii she almost hurts my eyes. I like the way each character looked, even if they were a little over the top. The colors are nice, the in game equipment looked passable. My biggest complaint, and it deals a lot with Ako, is the style of mouths they chose to use. When the Master of the guild (and student council president, of course) and Ako both smile, they just have this weird upturned look to their mouths. And at one point there is a kiss scene, and if smiles looked bad, the 'pucker' for the kiss went into dimensions of weird not even I can understand. Other than that though, I found this series easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe intro music is fun, and I didn't mind much the ending theme either, so passable in both instances. The in-show music was well done, and often sounded like a video game should sound, with tension or levity as needed. The voices are pretty awesome. I like Jad Saxton's work a lot, so its always nice to hear her in a show. The master and a later party member are pretty well balanced for their particular roles. The teacher acting as the club advisor was nicely voiced as well EXCEPT for in-game, where she becomes Nekohime and, ugh, meows every chance she gets. The main guy sounds solid, not too overconfident. He sounds like the kind of guy that would in fact give a helping hand to a new player. I liked his voice a great deal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Ako, the gamer who refuses real life, is terribly cute, and if you didn't notice there's an 'ecchi' tag on the genre list there to the left, so she's pretty damn stacked too. She is a bit of an oddity in that she has no real world social skills, but is basically a kind of Leroy in her own right, not having much of a clue in game either, running around drawing monsters, and getting everyone killed on accident. But it seems that her lack of playing skill is counterbalanced by her ability to socialize far more easily than she can face-to-face. We never learn of how the guild they are in started, but they all had to be outgoing enough to come to know each other, as finding out they are all at the same school is a shock and such. Ako is understandable, at least for me, as I often prefer my contact with others to be through this medium of the internet than in the real world. I'm actually painfully shy as well, and tend to duck behind others and mill at the back of crowds to avoid interacting with any more people than I absolutely have to. I think this is becoming far more acceptable in a way by the proliferation of social media. Many of us have Facebook friends we might not have had a real world visit with in years. Many have friends they've never met in real life. Ako's social anxiety is understandable, even if she's drawn in such a manner to be very suggestive and attractive. Even the pretty people can have social issues, or mental health problems, or those kinds of things. Those things come in people of every shape, size, and level of attractiveness. \\n\\n\r\nThe high school queen, the one voiced by Jad Saxton, has an interesting arc of having played and known the main guy online for a long time, not knowing that in real life she was quite rude and kind of bullied him. As they come to understand each other, work together to achieve goals, and just hang out, she lets her guard down in real life, and decides maybe she doesn't have to be *quite* so mean to the nerd. This is somewhat of a counter point to Ako, Ako comes out of her shell by interacting with the real word where queen bee comes out through the route of in game friendship. Even though she softens a little, she's \"one bad mammajamma!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe master of the guild and student council president is interesting in that she's a rich girl and uses a bit of the 'pay to win' mindset that many gamers really hate. She takes her premium gear and moves from being a bit of a show off in the beginning to using her funds for the benefit of the guild, and to bring enjoyment to her friends. Also, when she's in game and in her 'outfit' she appears to not have any nipples, as she only wears two strips of cloth hanging down each side of her body. Not that I was closely watching those parts or anything....\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do tend to come off a little on the 'one note' side, with the rich girl master, the queen of mean, and the busty bimbo, but it's not to the point that it saps much from the entertainment value. This anime is not about character building or weaving fantastic tales, its about gamers for gamers, acronyms and all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI did not get rick rolled one time watching this series, and I laughed out loud several times at some of the jokes. It was a fun ride, pretty predictable, but the easter eggs and gamer-service left me feeling like it wasn't a total waste of time. I imagine I'm going to watch this series again at some point just to see if there were any jokes or nods related to gaming that I missed the first time around. It was just a fun show about playing games with friends, and growing a little as you go along. I give it a thumbs up just for empty-headed Ako!\\n\\n\r\nSo if you've ever teabagged a camper or rocket jumped or set an alarm for a raid schedule, you might find things to enjoy here. Ako makes the RTRL wall of 'this game happy end'. I would write more, but I took an arrow to the wrist.",

            "content": "Even though this is just a one big wish fulfillment series, this show is actually one of my guilty pleasures. I'll explain somewhere below why I enjoyed this show so much. \r\n(There will be slight SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (5/10)\r\nBefore I watched this series, several people have warned me that this show is just a wish fulfillment harem series. While the wish fulfillment part may be true, this show is, in no way, a harem. If they were making jokes/making fun of the series then I would get why they would call this series a harem but on a technical standpoint, it's completely wrong. Adefinition of a \"harem\" is when 3 or more girls gains feelings or are in love with the main characters, which is not the case for Netoge since only 1 girl is in love with the MC and the MC later gains feelings for her. Also, what is it with anime and their ridiculous long-ass titles?\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the story is fairly simple. A dude named Hideki Nishimura plays an online MMORPG called \"Legendary Age\" and one day, he proposed to a female character online but it turned out that female character was a guy in real life. Nishimura, disappointed by this ordeal, swears to never trust another female character online ever again. Hence the title, because he's going to be eventually surrounded by girls later on in the series. \\n\\n\r\nSince this show doesn't have much of a story...Well, besides that arc where Nishimura and the club members decided to help Ako by making sure she can distinguish between a reality and fiction, there's really not much of a story here. The rest of the series are just otaku-pandering, fan-service-ecchi moments. Of course, one should not forget the obligatory \"beach episodes\" and the hot-spring episodes. If you enjoy that kind of stuff then Netoge has it all for you. Even though I don't enjoy fan-service moments, I admit that I did laugh watching those scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's comedy not only focuses on fan-service but the show also makes jokes about MMORPG and as a fan of video games, I welcome the jokes and I thought they were pretty funny. For example, they made jokes about the MMORPG's micro-transactions, Roles in MMORPG's like a Tank, Healer, Magician and how the characters misuse them and etc. If you don't play video games, let alone, a MMORPG then the jokes might fly over your head.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show's Romance and I'm glad the MC decided to accept Ako's feelings for him instead of mindlessly being f*cking dense and I'm also glad the girls didn't want his dick. This show would have easily turn into a harem because its got the right elements but the author decided not to go the harem route *phew*. Though, I wish Ako and Nishimura kissed at the end. I mean, it almost happened but it's one of those cliche moments where they got interrupted by someone or something. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first watched this series, I got this weird feeling. The character designs felt like some characters that I'd usually see when I'm watching Hentai except the characters here were more shiny and glossier. It turns out that the character designer for Netoge is a famous Hentai artist or some shit. The heavy emphasis on the character's lips and mouth pretty much gave it away. The visuals' pretty amazing though. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OSTs are nothing special. They sound just like the regular soundtrack that I'd regularly hear in some ecchi/rom-com anime so it's not worth talking about it. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"1st Love Story\" by Luce Twinkle Wink. This OP sounds almost exactly the same as Oreimo's OP, in terms of the tune and the chord progression. Hell, even the singer sounds like ClariS. *sigh*, Originality is overrated anyways. I'm surprised that ClariS hasn't sued their asses yet..The ED theme song is \"Zero Ichi Kiseki\" by Yoshino Nanjo. Ehh, it sounds ok. There's really nothing special about the ED. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7/10)\\n\r\nSo I enjoyed the show because of its comedy and the amount of references that this show makes to the MMORPG genre but one final thing that I enjoyed about the show is its characters. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, the protagonist, Hideki Nishimura a.k.a Rusian, might seem like a typical harem MC at first but he later turned out to be a likable character because he wasn't a dense fucker who drooled at all the girls around him. Later on, in the series, he noticed that Ako's feelings were true and he started gaining feelings for her. Though, that doesn't mean that he's not completely like a typical harem MC, because he still is.......somewhat... He still has one of those aspects that you'd normally see in a harem MC like him being nice to girls, being surrounded by girls but the only difference is they don't want his dick like Ako does, and he gets all embarrassed and/or act likes an idiot when he see's naked girls.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ako, which in my opinion is the best girl of the series and probably the best girl of Spring 2016. Ako is a female otaku who loves to spend most of her time playing video games while she's holed up inside her own room. She has trouble socializing with people and with her own classmates and she hates \"normies\" (I'm pretty sure you can guess what a \"normie\" is).  In other words, she's your typical gamer who fits the \"gamer\" stereotype. A shut-in gamer who has trouble socializing and hates the real world. This does give her room for character development because Rusian and the gang will help her solve her issues and you'll see her character change from being a shut-in gamer who doesn't want anything to do with real people to someone who managed to make friends and is somewhat able to notice the difference between a reality and a fiction. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Rusian and Ako who received character development, the other girls in the gaming club didn't really receive that much development or only little development. I feel like they were just there for plot device or something to help Ako and Rusian get together but nonetheless, they were still a bunch of interesting characters who made me laugh. There's Akane Segawa, a member of the gaming club and a tsundere. Man, the anime harem standards corrupted me because I was expecting her to gain feelings for the MC and I thought she was going to be a part of a harem but that didn't happen, thank god. There's also Kyou, a student council president who doesn't have friends (What the fuck?!) and she's completely like how those \"freemium (free and premium)\" players act. Kyou is easily one of the most funniest character in the series because of the way she acts. There's also two more members but introducing them is a major spoiler so I won't cross that line.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nWhat I thought was another trashy harem series that was going to go into my pile of harem garbage anime turned out to be a completely enjoyable non-harem anime series with MMORPG elements that made a gamer, like me, enjoy this series a whole lot more. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nNetoge turned out to be one of the series that I looked forward to every week last season because the comedy was hilarious and I really loved the jokes that they made about the MMORPG, especially that whole micro-transaction jokes. It may not be the best series out there but it was an enjoyable show to watch due to its comedy, the use of MMORPGs and of course, the romance. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+The series turned out to be a non-harem series\\n\r\n+Romance aspect of the series was enjoyable to watch\\n\r\n+The show's comedic aspect is hilarious\\n\r\n+Enjoyable cast of characters \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Fanservice, Fanservice, and a whole lot of Fanservice\\n\r\n-Not much of a story in the series\\n",

            "content": "This wonderful Rom-Com, was more than sarisfying in story and visuality. The proposition of a guy who's lost his desire to be any kind of normal, he has totally given up on a life of romantics, both in reality and in real life. He is fully set on that \"Games and Reality are separate!\" too quote him personally. But, alas he still gets married in the online game called \"Legendary Age\" he treasures so incredibly, just to find out his so called \"wife\" is a girl even in reality, and a beauty to top it off! They even go to the same school! Unfortunately, thisgirl can't distinguish her games from reality... Therefore, she thinks they're married even in real life. No matter how you look at it, this girl has got some screws loose!\\n\r\nHe struggles immensely with trying to teach her how to refrain from combining games and reality, however it does not prove easy...\\n\\n\r\nI have watched through the serie partaking in the story and it literally nailed me to the couch! It is incredibly artistic with both scenes for the sensitive girls to the game-addictive males. As I've written above it's a fantastic Rom-Com, which means it has it' moments, where it'll make you laugh, and where it makes you cringe, but hey! When has a serie not made you cringe at least once? Never! Exactly. So, therefore I really recommend it for most of the Anime-watchers out there, of course not everyone will like it, but that's just life. Everyone has their distinct taste in Anime, Games, and so on..\\n\r\nWell anyhow! To me this was definitely a Masterpiece!\\n\\n\r\nThat concludes this review. Hope you will also enjoy it! See ya!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I used to play World of Warcraft heavily, I would always set aside time for a female Draenei player that I fast befriended.\r\nWe would often just sit in Ironforge, using the emote phrases to goof around or talking to one another in our party chat. I was not smitten with her, but, being a teenage boy who managed to form a close bond with a girl who also had an interest in the same exact hobby, I will not lie and say I did not enjoy making her laugh.\r\nI never did learn much abouther, though. If she had her own family or what her age was. In fact, I cannot even say for certain that she was a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThat situation \u2013 a male playing a female character (and vice versa) \u2013 is a strange and possible one that comes with the territory, and, depending on the people and feelings involved, it can make for some awkward and embarrassing moments.\\n\\n\r\nNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? shows this outcome all too well.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNetoge (needed to shorten the title at this point) stars Hideki \u201cRusian\u201d Nishimura, a high-school dude who plays the new hit MMORPG Legendary Age. After mustering up the courage to ask an in-game (cat) woman to marry him, said woman reveals that she is actually a he in real life. Completely taken aback, Rusian chooses to never trust \u201cgirls\u201d online ever again \u2013 until a certain healer confesses to him in return.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show\u2019s title and its opening set of sequences may lead one to believe that the game itself is the primary factor, that notion is hardly the case. True, the show attempts to balance both elements \u2013 the game world and the real world \u2013 throughout the season. But, when the magic subsides and the shield is lowered, Netoge is very much more focused on life outside of the game.\\n\\n\r\nAko makes this idea more than obvious. An entire club is dedicated to rehabilitating her uncommon warping of the two worlds she inhabits. Study groups are formed, classes are skipped to support a girlfriend, and dangerous, criminal activity is (almost fully) carried out.\\n\\n\r\nIn focusing on the real, Netoge impresses upon not just Ako but also the audience that life is different than a game. Not that life isn\u2019t like a game, for it can certainly feel that way sometimes (e.g., getting a \u201clucky drop,\u201d learning a new skill, etc.). But rather, life, in contrast to any game, has consequences, reactions, and outcomes that have purposeful impacts on both the person and the people around him or her.\\n\\n\r\nThis idea is nice, but, unfortunately, Netoge seems to forget its own premise. The whole \u201cno girls exist online\u201d motif quickly gets dropped beyond the fourth episode or so since Rusian and Ako become (more or less) a couple.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the need to differentiate reality and the game. Once their club becomes official and the anime finishes with the introductions, it focuses more on the romance and the game itself. Both of which have their own issues.\\n\\n\r\nFor the romance, it is simply weak. Not very many personable moments exist between Rusian and Ako, and, even when they pop up, they almost always get exploited for comedic or non-serious developments.\\n\\n\r\nFor the game, it does not hold much relevance. As was said, reality is technically more important, but the anime does not contrast the two sides enough to accentuate either. Take what the characters normally do: talking at a table in their local tavern rather than adventuring.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc is particularly strange. It drops the focus on Rusian and especially Ako in favor of this cultural-festival dilemma. Yes, the game finally takes the forefront as opposed to being just a \u201cbackground\u201d element, but the conflict itself does not serve either the point of the narrative or even the characters themselves. No matter how game-centric it all happens to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that the ecchi material \u2013 some nakedness here, a bath scene there \u2013 has next to no meaning for Netoge beyond existing for viewing pleasure. I.e., the sexual content is, overall, unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the disparity between the game world and the regular world allows the anime to champion the notion that just because something is not \u201creal\u201d does not make it any less valuable. Winning a tough fight on their own or falling in love are just as real as watching fireworks beneath the night sky or receiving some words of encouragement from a close friend.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of where the events take place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNetoge falters hardest when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the character designs are pleasing. Glistening eyes. Attractive figures. Lots of vibrant colors (e.g., pink, orange). It also helps that the anime (at least near the beginning) had some cleverness in the portrayal of both Schwein and Master\u2019s male, online personas. Master\u2019s outfit becomes particularly risqu\u00e9 as a jab towards female armor in video games, and Ako\u2019s frilly, pink dress suits her cutesy character well.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the designs, however, Netoge encounters trouble.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the anime does not have much diversity when it comes to what actually goes on in the game world, the backgrounds and locations within Legendary Age are sparse. When in doubt, the show continually goes back to the same corner of that local inn, and, even when the crew does manage to venture elsewhere, it is more than likely lots of stone walls, open plains, or other low-detailed areas. The opposite of a video game.\\n\\n\r\nThe regular world is (relevantly) similar. Netoge shows parts of the school\u2019s classroom and hallways, the clubroom where Rusian and the others play, and the road leading back to their homes. Otherwise, differing locales are rarely shown. And since the designs are so nice, they make the dull backgrounds that much more obvious.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the simplified look of the game (when seen from the real world) and the real-life, Ako-featuring between-shots in the interlude for the A and B parts of the episodes (which is quite meta) add flair where it is desperately needed.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation also fails to hold up. The first couple of episodes, where Ako moves in happy or silly ways, is evident, but, the further along the anime progresses, the choppier the animation becomes. The fight scenes do not have much choreography, the characters are usually just sitting or standing without a lot of hair or eye movement, and the anime simply does not have a lot going on to get its characters moving.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the girls\u2019 breasts; those never stop bouncing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nA case can be made for Netoge being an anime about Rusian. After all, he warms up the audience first with his failed attempt at romance. The rest of the season sees him at odds with his newfound \u201cnever trust a girl online\u201d philosophy as well as his budding relationship with Ako.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime goes from being about \u201cfake\u201d girls online to participating in some guild battles \u2013 which subsequently take away from the relationship building and the main motif of the anime itself. Altogether, Rusian\u2019s character does not have much going for him.\\n\\n\r\nSo, perhaps obviously, the anime isn\u2019t so much about Rusian as it is about Ako.\\n\\n\r\nAko starts off in a rough spot. Shy and a recluse, she rarely speaks to anyone at school let alone has any friends she can confide in. So, when their group chooses to officially meet offline for the first time, it is clear how ecstatic Ako is to finally be with people that she can at least hang out with.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, she is not exactly of sound mind, for she does not see a distinction between the game world and the real world. She believes Rusian is her fated husband, she refers to Segawa as Schwein, and she does not tolerate \u201cnormies\u201d whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nHer inability to separate the two worlds causes Rusian, Schwein, and Master to band together to form the Net Game Club in an attempt to curb Ako\u2019s delusions for good.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, that does not happen. She believes Rusian\u2019s confession \u201cdemotes\u201d her from wife to girlfriend, and, more startlingly, she does not seem to care much for anything outside of the game because, to her, the game is all that matters.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, she does not swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. But she does, however minimally, escape from her constant, reclusive lifestyle. She starts going to school more. She goes on a sleep-over with the other girls. She hangs out with Rusian and the others at the beach during their summer vacation.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, Ako\u2019s relationship with Rusian is both supported and tested. He visits her house, letting her see the lengths he would go to for her. She instantly recognizes Rusian\u2019s imposter, demonstrating her close connection with her hubby. And they get remarried (in game) in front of all their friends.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, Rusian and Ako do not follow through on that pivotal kiss. It is also obvious that Ako still has pretty much the same mindset about both worlds being intertwined. And that\u2019s perfectly okay. For where everyone else seeks to explain to Ako that the two worlds are separate, Ako argues (and, indeed, represents) the idea that both worlds are not so different.\\n\\n\r\nYes, she can get a bit crazy at times, wanting to go all the way with Rusian (in private chat) without a second thought or choosing to reincarnate when Rusian is being \u201cstolen\u201d from her. But that does not make her own perspective (entirely) wrong. To her, the relationships she holds with those online do not lose their authenticity when viewed offline. In other words, the game and reality are one in the same.\\n\\n\r\nHaving both sides of the argument \u2013 that the two worlds are both different and the same \u2013 gives Netoge some clout. Unfortunately, when the final arc arrives, it strangely pushes Ako out of the limelight, reducing her chances at further development and missing out on more exploration for this topic. Nevertheless, her whole character is easily one of the stronger parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else \u2013 namely Schwein, Master, Sette, and Nekohime \u2013 they exist purely to help Ako and, by extension, Rusian. Schwein provides the harsher way of looking at the situation (with the occasional sentimental moment). Master supplies them with the gear and the opportunities. Sette gets right to the heart of the matter. And Nekohime simply guides them all from afar.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that Ako and Rusian are the priority, it is acceptable that they do not do much else. However, they do not get a pass when it comes to their own interconnections. For while Ako and Rusian clearly hold a tight bond, it is hard to say that about any other pairing.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, though, they do hold a commonality between each other: anti-social skills. Schwein desperately wants to lead a normal high-school life, hiding her true passion for the game and her \u201cbad self.\u201d Master, despite her student-council-president title, does not talk to anyone. And Nekohime does her best to connect with her students, but nothing can match the adoration her fan-made guild holds for her.\\n\\n\r\n(Sette is the odd one out because she already is the odd one out. As a non-gamer and straightforward person, she has no trouble interacting with her fellow students.)\\n\\n\r\nDoes this make them strong characters? Not really. Mostly because the anti-social angle for them is not so much a prominent theme as it is just a detail to get them all together. But it is still nice to see that, game or not, they are there as friends for one another.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNetoge has a peculiar issue: it relies too much on the cut-music-away-for-comedic-effect technique. For many of the different jokes during the season, they will build something up or go a certain direction \u2013 only to halt the building or directing. With the shift comes an immediate drop or change in the music being played. It\u2019s a common technique for the medium, but Netoge does it so much that it becomes noticeable and therefore distracting.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Toyonaga as Rusian is likewise a problem. Not that his voice acting takes away from the show, but pieces of dialogue are not as strong as others. When he jumps from an aircraft, his hollers and excitement come off as unamused, and, when he gets mad (often declaring that \u201cthe game and reality are separate\u201d), his anger does not have the oomph, the irritation behind it to make it believable.\\n\\n\r\nRina Hidaka as Ako and Inori Minase as Schwein thankfully make up somewhat for his missteps. Ms. Hidaka gives Ako a happy, cute voice that fits the bubbly girl well, and Ms. Minase strikes the tsundere persona with ease.\\n\\n\r\n(As a side note, Schwein\u2019s little piggy sound that sometimes played when she entered the frame or did something noteworthy was a nice touch.)\\n\\n\r\nSome of the tracks from the original soundtrack are also worth noting. The main romantic piece, with its soft piano and sentimental tone, makes it hard not to smile when it is played. The acoustic-guitar track is likewise uplifting. And the little bit of transition music from the A and B parts of the episodes is nice, too. However, the hip-hop track that gets used regularly does not fit the setting and atmosphere of the anime, hurting the OST\u2019s overall strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening and ending tracks, they are a mixed bag. The OP is not very flashy, relying mostly on a pop tune, steady pacing, and somewhat flat singing. The ED performs better with its techno sound-effects and slight variance in pacing, but the singing, once again, is not all that impressive to hear.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why I liked this one: Ako and the romance.\\n\\n\r\nAko was cute when she tried hitting the ogres frantically or when she was overjoyed to finally meet the real-life Rusian. She could be funny, too, when doing karate chops in the air or when she made it sound as though her night with Rusian was lewder than what it actually was. And she was kind, accepting the craziness of the others without reservation.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance made it all that much better. Tiny moments like Rusian buying her ice cream would make me smile. But grander ones, like when Rusian visited her in her room and gave her his full support, got me audibly \u201cAww!\u201d-ing on multiple occasions. (Also, that room scene had one of my favorite jokes: where Ako\u2019s yandere tendencies almost manifested as urine for tea.)\\n\\n\r\nI do wish the other characters were more fun, though. Schwein could be silly when Sette discovered her secret, and Master believing that her affluent lifestyle was normal could get me to laugh. But they did not have much of a presence, both influence- and personality-wise, throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? provides a thoughtful, if misguided, experience. The contrasting worlds and Ako\u2019s character are strengths of the show, but the subpar animation, the underdeveloped romantic relationship, and some sound-related issues are obvious weaknesses. It\u2019s an entertaining anime, but it lands in awkward territory \u2013 with or without female Draenei in the equation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while focus gets lost and the heart of the romance beats irregularly, the disparity between the game world and the regular world, and its theme on realness, make the narrative more than just a bunch of comedy and ecchi scenes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, nice character designs, a more-often-than-not boring artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Ako develops as a character and counters the others\u2019 view on their two worlds being separate, with Schwein, Master, Sette, Nekohime, and especially Rusian supporting Ako along the way\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and a repetitive comedic technique\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, still liked the romantic elements and Ako especially, but Schwein and the others were not too memorable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

Some twists andturns occur and they me meet in real life, proving his in game wife is indeed a solid 9/10 on the loli index\\n\r\nThere isn't a harem tag for this anime, but let me be clear the MC is a weakling and what do we know about weaklings,they make perfect Harem MC, its a proven fact\\n\r\nBut after the first episode the story develops into something more than just boy meets girl but rather a heart warming story of friends trying to break the line between game and reality that Ako is blurring\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack : Nothing much to say here, average cutsie music, you definitely won't be contemplating life listening to it\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : Usually i don't mind animation because i'm all about the \"plot\" but i have to say the colorful scenery and the camera work really bring this anime to life\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : This is where this anime shines. Right of the bat we can relate to the MC, qwerky loser that can't talk to girls but is a horn dog. The only thing we cannot relate to is the fact that the MC seems to be skinny, and let's be honest viewers of this anime can't see our toes anymore. What makes a Harem great is not what the MC can do but what the women do\\n\r\nWe have our tsundere, simple not over the top but is there for some quick laughs . We got our president, again simple and not memorable\\n\r\nOther women trying to get a piece of our MC but again not memorable, except my pink haired goddess, what a babe\\n\r\nBut lastly, we got our main wife, and she is amazing, she is the embodiment of our worldly desires, her VA really portrays what we think our wife would sound, when we become a wizard at age 30.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it, as a veteran gamer i can say there aren't any girls that play video games, wait no, there aren't any pretty girls that play video games\\n\r\nWith this anime in hand, we, as the viewers must appreciate this anime of the season. I can safely say, this anime is a must watch for all mmorpg, loli, harem, chicken breast lovers. \\n\\n\r\nWith the completion of this anime i would have to say i'm disappointed  with the lack of harem and the absurd amount of censoring of the bresticles \\n",

Only problem was that 12 episodes was too short and the ending seemed slightly rushed. 13 episodes would have been perfect to wrap it all up although i'd have been cool with 20+ also. Your typical slice of life/school romance comedy anime although with a unique twist in regards to the storyline. Yes it had your standard Online gaming theme in it as well however it's take on it was different from other anime in this genre and quite comedic that kept me smiling throughout. No it's not top tier in its art or animation andif i had to break it down piece by piece it would probably be a 6 but my overall enjoyment of this anime is what made me give it a 10 for the simple fact that its a feel good anime that makes you happy and keeps things interesting each episode. Would recommend for anyone who likes romantic comedy anime",

The story takes place in this modern time, so don't look for mechas or magicians, magicians can be found only in the scenes where our \"main characters\" are playing an MMO game named: Legendary Age(LA). The game revolves around the whole, at least most of the whole anime. Reminds me of SAO, anyone? Except that here they dont put on headset but playing in safe of home before the monitor. Our main characters are studying on high-school somewhere in Japan. And of course, all main characters are playing that game, some of wich will be added in the time.

            "content": "Being unable to discern the difference between fantasy and reality is a fear that many a critic of games and other fictional media frequently purport. You see it on the news every now and then, how someone committed a murder that mimicked an event they saw in a game, and that violent fiction spurs one on to commit villainous deeds since they don't realise that it actually has some real life consequences. Yet little do they touch on the other effects that it might have; they only latch onto and showcase the most awful examples in an effort to definitively prove their case. Netoge noYome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? (And you thought there was never a girl online?) is a fun little anime that touches on this in a more positive spin. Centring on a group of highschool gamers going by the online monikers of Rusian, Ako, Schwein and Apricot, Netoge explores - in an albeit exaggerated and comical fashion - some of the other issues and events that might arise should one struggle to separate their gaming world from the real one. \\n\\n\r\nAfter deciding one day that the four of them should meet up in real life, they're all shocked to discover that not only do they all live in the same area, but they all know of each other already, as they go to the same school and share many classes. Whilst making their initial meet-up both awkward and somewhat easier to deal with (it's less daunting to meet and talk with people you know than with strangers, after all) it brings with it a slew of issues and problems, the biggest of which is immediately brought to light - Ako, the Guild's newbie healer, cannot separate fantasy from fiction. It is first seen in her naming convention - Rusian is called Hideki Nishimura in real life, Schwein is called Akane Segawa, Apricot is called Kyou Goshouin, and Ako....is called Ako Tamaki. Unlike the rest, she has not bothered using a different online name because she doesn't consider there to be any difference between Legendary Age - the game they play - and the rest of the world. To make matters yet more problematic, Ako and Rusian are married in LA, which she then considers to be carried over when they finally meet up, immediately clinging to his arms and addressing him in a far more intimate fashion than people usually would. \\n\\n\r\nThis provides the basis for the vast majority of the content that follows. Ako's inability to discern between pixels and reality becomes a focal point for the group, as they all decide to form a gaming club to try and help Ako out of her problem. It is not so easy as that, however, since Ako is undescribably dumb. This is also where my opinion on this anime split - whilst it managed to be somewhat entertaining and comical with all the misunderstandings and problems that Ako made, it also served to act as a point of contention because her idiocy was at times excessive, and completely halted the plot from advancing. This was especially prevalent in the relationship between Ako and Rusian; Netoge really had a huge chance here to separate itself from other harem-esque highschool anime much in the same way Rakudai separated itself from Asterisk - they could have went for an actual relationship, but decided that Ako was so deluded that she already considered herself Rusian's wife and therefore didn't need to accept a confession of feelings from him.\\n\\n\r\nI felt really quite disapppointed at this particular aspect, because the relationship route is seldom tread in this type of anime and thus is one which I absolutely root for - pun not intended. The flipside to Ako's delusions, though, were many of her other actions and misdeeds - such as assaulting her teacher when she mistakenly believes Rusian is cheating on her with their sensei in the game, or how she was completely non-plussed when Rusian walked in on her when she was naked - Hell, her reaction was actually brilliant in that particular scene because she was happy about it. It ends up being an arbitrary toss up between which scenes I enjoyed and which I didn't; at times her delusions were handled in a funny manner, but other times it just seemed overly exaggerated and dragged out for the sake of it. \\n\r\nAs far as all of the characters go, they're a mashup of previously seen tropes but have their own little spins on them for the most part. The aforementioned Ako plays the role of the romantic main girl, as Nishimura the person, not Rusian the character develops feelings for her pretty soon off the bat. She's rather ditzy, and refuses to accept things for what they are. Everyone else bands together to try to help her out of her predicament.\\n\\n\r\nRusian is the lucky male who gets to spend all of his time with his female guildies. He's fairly typical as far as male harem-esque MCs go, but one thing that sets him apart is the fact that he is actually true to his feelings and confesses (multiple) times. It was a breath of fresh air to have a high schooler who wouldn't just freak the fuck out over even the thought of confessing.\\n\r\nSchwein plays the role of the textbook tsundere character (who bears a striking resemblance to Lieseharte from Saijaku). However, in the game she is a very self-confident player; she refers to herself as 'ore-sama' and her overall gaming persona is vastly different to how she acts in person.\\n\r\nApricot - dubbed 'Master' by the rest of the crew since she is the guild leader - is the student council president at their school, and is considerably wealthy. She uses that wealth in order to be one of those pay-to-win filth by buying all the best gear, weapons and consumables. Her family's success also leads to them having many properties, including their own private beach; all of these residences she owns become, at one point, a staging post for them to try and wean Ako off of online gaming. In this respect, the obligatory beach episode actually makes a lot of sense since there was some context behind it. It made the inclusion of such a clich\u00e9 much better.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, since there's a beach episode, you can expect lots of fanservice, and there's a healthy amount of it throughout the anime. The handling of it, however, is a positive thing from my perspective - a lot of that fanservice felt either very natural or was used for comical purposes. The natural fanservice occurred in the game. For anyone who's ever played a fantasy RPG, you'll know that female gear is typically quite revealing, and much of it is like that in LA too. Apricot's entire top half is uncovered, aside from two lines of fabric which cover her nipples, the rest of her boobs spilling out around it. There're other times when the characters show a lot of flesh, such as Ako being found naked by Rusian - yet despite how that trope normally plays out, Ako's reaction was \"Please, be gentle with me!\" The little twists on the typical tropes and clich\u00e9s made it a fair point more entertaining than what it would otherwise be. \\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice was also bettered by the series' art - it certainly made all the characters look cute and attractive. It reminded me a lot of Aishen Qiaokeli-ing, what with how huge the eyes of Ako were and the colour palette in general. It worked much in the anime's favour because of the decent aesthetics. However, one of my personal issues with the art style is the way that the bottom lip for the female characters is drawn on but the top isn't. The result of this is that everytime the characters have their mouths closed, it looks like their bottom lip is being pulled over their top lip, and once I noticed it I couldn't stop seeing it. It seems like a small thing, but when the characters are supposed to be attractive, seeing such a weird-looking lip ruined the effect to a certain extent.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, it brings you to the question of \"Should I watch Netoge?\" I'd say for those that like harem-esque anime the answer is a yes. It might include a lot of the stereotypical traits of other anime of this type, but it's got enough of its own unique touches to stand aside on its own two feet, and if you like those tropes anyway then that's even better. It doesn't have an overriding plot such as saving the world or fighting off an evil organisation that plagues many other similar series either; having it revolve around a bunch of gamers make it feel a lot more natural, even if it's still exaggerated. But it's not without its own problems. As previously mentioned, Ako's issue of being unable to discern fiction from reality was both funny and annoying. I became rather disappointed in the middle of the series when it could have progressed, but instead decided that Ako was such an idiot that absolutely nothing could be done to salvage her. In that regard this series could have been much better, and I would have been inclined to rate it higher. It still remained funny and light-hearted throughout, though, and for gamers it's somewhat relateable. You can have those little chuckles to yourself when you see the similarities in the anime to stuff that's actually happened to you before, such as how Ako is the token useless female who's only in the guild because she's in a relationship with one of the main players - oh, that brings back many an argument... \\n\\n\r\nBut it was a fun ride, even if it could have been better. Attractive characters (if you can ignore the lips), comical situations and throwbacks in gaming. A fairly standard series that has a few little perks to separate itself from the rest of the pack.\\n",

            "content": "Hello everybody! I hope you've all been having a fantastic day, because today, I'm going to talk about what is probably one of the cutest anime you'll ever see. A show about MMOs and the girls who play them. A show who's name is so long I do not feel like saying it, but will anyway. Yes, I'm going to talk to about netoge no yome wa onnanoko ja nai to omotta, or And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online? God that was a mouthful.\r\nWe begin our story with a young woman confessing her love to the man of her dreams, only toget shot down. Don't worry. This is all happening online. Fortunately for us, our young heroine isn't quite ready to give up. When her confession is rejected, she decides to go for broke. (Add video audio). That's right, Ladies and gentlemen, she figures that if he's going to reject her confession, then they should just get married.\\n\\n\r\nI really have to hand it to Project No. 9. When they first created this series, I didn't think it was going to amount to much. My thoughts were along the lines of, \u201coh, this is just gonna be another Sword Art Online or Log Horizon.\u201d Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike either of those anime, but I didn't think this series was going to contain anything original. I have never been so glad to be wrong. While I wouldn't say And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online? Brings anything new to the table, I feel like there are enough original twists on used tropes that I didn't get bored with the series. In fact, I enjoyed myself far more than I thought I would.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Hideki Nishimura, an open otaku who spends a lot of time playing the net game, Legendary Age. He, along with three other people, have formed a guild within the game called Alley Cats. His other companions are Schwein, a confident swordsman with a weird catchphrase; Apricot, a mage who spends a lot of money buffing his items and weapons, and also the leader of the Alley Cats; and finally, Ako, his loving in-game waifu.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, Apricot decides that they should meet each other IRL. When Nishimura goes to the meeting place, he is shocked to discover that not only are all of the people in his guild women, but they all go to his school. Coincidence? Of course not. The plot devicing is strong in this one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my joke, I really enjoyed this series. I don't think there was a single episode that I watched where I wasn't smiling. I was greatly impressed by the humor. All of their jokes were not only well timed, but they were also funny. I'm not lying when I say that the humor found in here was probably some of the best I've seen in a while. The only anime that was funnier was KonoSuba, but it would be exceedingly difficult to beat that series when it comes to RPG gamer jokes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were two jokes that I found particularly outstanding. The first was when Ako decided to quite school due to a misunderstanding. Hideki goes to her house to talk to her, but he ends up meeting her mom first. He's then given a key to Ako's room. He goes up to Ako's room and they talk for a bit. We hear some bumping noises in the background, followed by Hideki telling Ako that he's coming in. Ako tries to stop him, but he doesn't listen, and then unlocks and opens the door. Ako is practically naked.\\n\\n\r\nNow, walking in on a girl while she's naked is an anime trope that's been done to death. In fact, having this trope is almost like a right of passage for generic harem anime. What made this scene funny was how they subvert the trope by putting an original twist on it. First, the door is locked. In anime, whenever the main character walks in on a girl when she's either changing or taking a shower, the door is always unlocked. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe the girl's just don't think the main character is capable of opening doors, or maybe it's just a poorly disguised plot device to show some censored boobies. Whatever the case may be, I like how the door is locked here, and the main character unlocks it and enters anyway. The second subversion of the trope is Ako's reason for being naked in the first place. She likes to feel free and uninhabited when she's in her own room. What makes this interesting is that there are actually people who are like this. In fact, when I'm at home, I generally don't wear much, and sometimes I don't wear anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe last subversion of the trope is when Ako tells Nishimura that she's ready, and he opens the door again, only to discover that, rather than putting her clothes back on, she has taken what little she was wearing off. While this has been done before, what made me laugh was how Ako feels like it's a perfectly normal response because they're married in-game.\\n\\n\r\nThe other joke that I liked was the pee joke, and I don't think I need an explanation as to why I found that funny.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy in this anime is often hilarious, this series is not without its more touching moments. There are many instances where the characters deal with real life issues, and while some of these problems are exaggerated or overemphasized, I think a lot of people, gamers especially, can relate to the quandaries these characters face.\\n\\n\r\nI was particularly interested in Ako's problem. Ako is a person who has trouble separating reality from the video game. In fact, the entire premise for this anime is that Ako is so absorbed by the game world that she assumes what applies in the game also applies in real life. A good example of this is how she thinks Nishimura is her husband IRL. Not only does she think they're married in both reality and the game, but she even calls him by his in-game name of Rusian when they aren't playing, thereby informing everyone that when she looks at Nishimura, she doesn't see Nishimura but Rusian instead.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Ako and her reality issues, my next favorite character is Akane Segawa. I'll admit that a part of me likes her just because her voice actress is Jad Saxton. I've loved her voice overs since she played Suzuka Dairenji from Tokyo Ravens. However, I also feel like Segawa's character is the strongest personality wise. Unlike the other members of her guild, Segawa is a hardcore gamer who wants to have a reputation in school as a normal high school girl. It's like she wants to deny the part of herself that loves net games, but she can't give them up, which is why she turns down every boy who confesses to her. Having a boyfriend would mean less time to game.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Akane and Ako, the other four characters to note are Nishimura Hideki, Kyo Goshoin, and the two supporting characters Nanako and Yui. While none of these characters are bad, I felt like they didn't have as strong of a personality as either Akane and Ako. That said, I still had loads of fun watching them. Kyo, who plays Apricot in the game, is the daughter of a wealthy family. She spends crap loads of real money buffing her in-game weapons and armor. She's also the spearhead for the get together, and the one who forms the net game club so they can hang out at school. Meanwhile, Hideki is technically the main character. I say technically because he gets the most screen time, but in truth, Kyo, Ako, and Akane also play pivotal roles in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the cute story, the anime isn't anything especially spectacular. I do appreciate the artwork, and the animations were good enough that I certainly won't complain. That said, while the artwork was lovely, this series isn't going to win any awards for it's animation. It was just okay, and honestly, I don't think it needs to be anything other than okay. Where this anime really shines isn't with its animation and artwork, but with its characters. For people who enjoy playing video games, and especially online games, it's easy for you to feel a sense of kinship with these characters. Aside from all of them being very likable, they also make me think of myself when I went to high school.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who love video games, I would highly recommend giving this series a watch. You can watch it in either subtitles or dubbed. While I usually prefer subtitles to dubbing, I honestly prefer the dubs for this anime. I believe the VAs had a really strong showing here, and the jokes made more sense to me dubbed than when I had to read subtitles.",

            "content": "I think a lot of people get the wrong idea about this anime revolving around an MMO instead of realizing that for the most part the anime focused more on the nuance of MMO players rather than the actual game. The whole anime is meant to create a variety or characters who each take different (and often opposing) standpoints on gaming and helps to make the characters feel more unique as well as creating interesting dialog. I personally love the plot of the show but believe that the ending has a weak buildup and during the end their choice to focus actual story time onthe game was a wasted effort considering how generic the game they play actually is. Other than the occasional moments where they focus more on the game and less on each other this anime has a pretty solid plot and some minor character development that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about their IRL appearances and even less so in the game where everything is generic and bland.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and sub are both terrible voiced and the music in too repetitive and indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the bad animation and delivery I overall enjoyed it. At first it seemed the anime was going to take a more edgy approach towards ako's internal conflict but I was glad they didn't overdo it and more often that not used it to make her character seem more appealing in a comedic way than in a cliche tragic way so at the least the anime gets points for not following conventions.\\n",

            "content": "Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta was an anime I had little to no expectations about. The key visuals and PV were bland, and the synopsis wasn\u2019t interesting. I couldn\u2019t help but assume that the series would turn out to be clich\u00e9. Well, I turned out to be half wrong. The series does have its fair share of clich\u00e9s, but it also tries to challenge them. Maybe not to the extent of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, but it tries. It handles its premise nicely and it manages to bring up real life gaming problem and situations without feeling surreal. And at times,I get some genuine chuckles from this series. It may not be for everyone, and it may not give the best first impressions, but it\u2019s surely something worth checking out from this season.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nWell, NetoYome doesn\u2019t have the most original premise for an anime, especially one with those genres. The story is about a boy named Nishimura, who virtually marries a girl named Ako in an MMORPG, and later ends up meeting her and his guild in real life, only to find out that they\u2019re all from the same school. The series then revolves around these main characters and their daily life with the MMORPG, and how they can make Ako differentiate between reality and the gaming world. There\u2019s no real main story in the series and the main goal for the characters (helping Ako find the difference between the two worlds), is so vague that it feels non-existent. However, it\u2019s fun seeing the characters go through different situations. Though the writing is a mixture of both a mixture of comedy and drama. There will be moments when the series takes a humorous approach towards situations, but there are moments when NetoYome tackles real life situations like hacking. Though the plot never goes anywhere, and it seems like the characters are still on square one by the time the series ends.\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThe most impressive thing about NetoYome is the fact that it\u2019s not as generic as it looks and sounds. It\u2019s quite refreshing to see an anime with one male lead and many females as main characters, without it being a harem. Even though it\u2019s labeled as a romance, there\u2019s not much romance too it. Ako and Nishimura\u2019s relationship is used more as a comedic relationship than a romantic one. As mentioned before, the series manages to tackle some pretty important themes and the series can take a serious tone at time. That being said, the series is at its best when it\u2019s lighthearted. Ako\u2019s addiction for that MMO and he unyielding love for Nishimura is what makes this series shine. That being said, the series heavily relies on her character for content. If viewers don\u2019t end up liking her as a character, chances are they won\u2019t like the series as a whole because she is the backbone for this series.\\n\r\nPresentation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bad as some of them are likable and nice, while others feel like wasted potential. Our protagonist, Nishimura Hideki, is an alright main character. His relationship with Ako is entertaining enough and some of his remarks are quite funny (like when he entered Ako\u2019s room for the first time). That being said, it would have been nice if his reactions were more over-the-top (similar to Kazuma from KonoSuba), because Nishimura never ends up being memorable. Tamaki Ako ended up being the most likable and most memorable. She is the poster girl of this series after all. Her lack of common logic and her inability of differentiating fiction and reality is what makes this series so much fun. And her yandere mode, which was present near the beginning of the series, is fun. The rest of the characters, however, don\u2019t end up being memorable in any way. Segawa Akane feels like wasted potential as she never played a major role in anything and Goshouin Kyou is just there so the anime can have a \u201cwise-senpai\u201d character.\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art is quite good in NetoYome. The character designs are quite neat and unique in some ways. The characters normally have lips (well, at least the lower lip) and it really makes the characters stand out in appearance. Nishimura\u2019s design is quite bland and it doesn\u2019t make him stand out, but Ako looks great. Her messy hair and lack of wearing tucked-in clothes add to her careless characteristics. NetoYome makes sure that you can judge what type of character Ako is by just looking at her appearance, just like how you can do that with someone in real life. The backgrounds in the series is also quite good looking, and the game world looks nice too. The art style is quite unique too. Especially during the game moments, the anime features an art style with more bleached-out, pinkish color with heavier outlining. Personally, this art style made the series look better.\\n\r\nArt: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation quality in NetoYome is decent and is consistent for most of the time. It\u2019s nothing too special, but it works. There wasn\u2019t any noticeable moment where the animation quality dropped. That being said, there isn\u2019t any moment in the series when it would be challenging for the studio to animate it. Most of the series is just standard talking and walking, and even during the fantasy/game world moments, there aren\u2019t really any big action scenes when a good amount of effort needs to be put in. But the studio does the basics and does whatever they do properly. It\u2019s consistent and fluid, and that\u2019s all that matters. \\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast in NetoYome aren\u2019t the most well-known, yet they manage to do a very good job in what they have to do. Some shine more than others, but overall, it\u2019s a good cast. Toyonaga Toshiyuki does a good job as Nishimura, as he manages to make Nishimura sound funny whenever he gives his opinion on a comedic situation. It\u2019s nothing extraordinary, but it\u2019s fine. Hidaka Rina did a fantastic job as Ako; it\u2019s spot-on. She manages to make Ako feel like a careless and illogical character, while making her likable and somewhat adorable The rest of the cast, such as seiyuu like Ichimichi Mao and Minase Inori, do a satisfactory job in their role. It\u2019s nothing too great, but it works well. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in NetoYome is alright, but I was hoping for something more. The OP, \u201c1st Love Story\u201d, is pretty decent, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m with listening to it once. Nothing too special, though it remind me of Oreimo\u2019s OP. The ED, \u201cZero Ichi Kiseki\u201d, is quite good though. The music is average, but the vocals are nice. The background music is quite lackluster though, as none of the music ever stand out. They all feel very average in some way. For a game that also focuses on a fantasy setting, one would have expected some likable tracks, but unfortunately the series is lacking that. Sometimes the OP music is used as music, and that\u2019s far better than their own original soundtrack. \\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI liked NetoYome a lot more than I thought I would. I think I liked NetoYome more than I should. It\u2019s got some obvious flaws, such as the series going nowhere, both is story and character relationships, and it\u2019s got a fair share of clich\u00e9s. But it\u2019s the characters (primarily the two main leads) and the handling of their concept that makes the series so much more than it is. It might have very well been the biggest surprise of this season for me and for many people that are watching some seasonal anime. If this series ever gets a second season, I\u2019ll definitely be on board. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta is worth checking out, even if you aren\u2019t fans of the genre. Don\u2019t be turned off by the ecchi tag as there\u2019s not too much fanservice in the series, and unlike what the key visuals make you think, it\u2019s not a harem. That being said, there\u2019s not much romance in the series so don\u2019t keep your expectations, on that aspect, high. NetoYome is funny and interesting at times. The series also manages to tackle some more serious problems, with their humor added in. It would\u2019ve been nice if the Ako and Nishimura\u2019s relationship developed more, but\u2019s it\u2019s fine the way it is. After all, there\u2019s only so much you can ask from a ecchi light novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n+ The two main character are likable and have a good chemistry \\n\r\n+ Genuinely funny at times \\n\r\n+ Handles and focuses on some real life tech and gaming problems. \\n\r\n+ Great character designs, as they can represent the character\u2019s personality \\n\r\n- Main story fades away and character relationships go nowhere \\n\r\n- Supporting characters feel lackluster \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10",

If you think the internet is just full of GIRLs (guys in real life), then let this show prove you otherwise.\r\nIf the title isn't an accurate description, then let me summarize the plot. It revolves around Rusian, a guy who got rejected by a character in an MMORPG. The reason: the character was  guy in real life. Many of us can relate to this situation. And that's enough reason to watch the show. Then he meets another girl inthe game and then they meet in real life. And just like that, they're married. Now, this is pretty much a one-in-a-million occurrence, but it's nice to see how it might look like if couples online become couples in real life. It's cute.\\n\\n\r\nIf that's not cute enough, then perhaps the heroine will catch you eye: Ako. She most certainly caught mine for several reasons. Other than the fact that she's cute, she has a personality which is too adorable to take. A yandere willing to do anything for her Rusian. It makes you wish you had your own Ako. But life doesn't really work that way, so we can only watch this and cry to ourselves as it happens right before our screens.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest rating I gave to this anime is in the art. It's so fluid and colorful, it separates itself from similar romance anime. Although their smiles are creepy sometimes...\\n\\n\r\nI would very much recommend it to gamers and non-gamers alike. Not only does it have gaming situations which gamers can relate to, it also has scenarios which you actually want to happen to you. And you thought there was no romance in MMORPG...",

            "content": "Oh, great. Another light novel adaptation with a harem, a stupidly long title that nobody in their right mind would want to pronounce, and a story revolving around MMOs. The anime industry clearly hasn't had enough of those. \r\nIt would be one thing if Netoge was just more run-of-the-mill mediocrity, but it instead goes all the way in being silly tripe. This is an anime where the protagonist's entire set of friends in an online game just so happen to be attractive (in some cases, popular) girls who, conveniently, attend the exact same high school and know him personally, including a twintailed tsundere and hisin-game waifu who immediately clings all over him and proclaims herself his wife, despite not actually knowing anything about who he is in the real-world. If you were to drop the show immediately after the first episode, I would not blame you, and I would actually suggest you are making the right choice. It certainly does not do anything in the later episodes to convince otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nFor what is supposed to be an anime involving romance, said 'romance' is about as shallow and as juvenile as it can possibly get. They love each other over a video game. A game! This is not love--- it is two mentally troubled and lonely children infatuated with one another because they share a superficial hobby and because they cannot get anyone better. Anyone who has dated before, especially at a young age, knows that desperate relationships like these never go anywhere. And the two of them like to imagine themselves a married couple? Really? Marriage is not play-time-- it requires a great deal of compromise and sacrifice, and would crush their childish fantasy as a result. A couple like this would not last more than a few weeks in reality, much less a lifetime. So forgive me if I do not care when the show tries to make me feel for them (and often, unfortunately, it does). \\n\\n\r\nAnything that comes out of Ako's mouth is a pain to the senses. She claims real-life is a kusoge and compares luck to item drops in a game. Even the most extreme of otaku on 2ch and other places have the sense to treat these sorts of comments as a joke. That Ako is completely serious about it makes it quite clear that she is a basket-case and that the show has no interest in painting her as an actual person. She is a collection of silly tropes to throw on a body pillow and sell to otaku. At least something like Oreimo, as painful a show as it often was, actually made an effort to make its characters something more than that. \\n\\n\r\nOn numerous occasions, Ako makes it clear that she is a terrible girlfriend who has no right dating anyone. She even goes as far as to lie about meeting up with another dude to get back at the protagonist and make him jealous. Anybody, whether male or female, who thinks this is acceptable behaviour is, frankly, scum. He should have dumped her right then and there. But he didn't, and he won't, because this is a harem anime, and harem anime do not care for their characters behaving like sensible human beings. \\n\\n\r\nNetoge isn't all too interested in making the other girls (and there are a whole four of them) feel like they actually have a place in the story. They could just as easily be taken out of the show entirely without it affecting all that much. They exist primarily as eye-candy, showing up, for example, in a vapid 'beach episode', where they join Ako, swimsuits and all, in lathering the protagonist with sunscreen. Netoge doesn't really have any idea of whether it wants to commit solely to Ako or fully embrace the harem route, and often it will switch directions one or more times per episode. They encourage the protagonist and his relationship with Ako, and then the next moment they'll be rubbing their breasts against him or blushing in some pseudo-confession scene. Why? For what purpose?\\n\\n\r\n(It also goes without saying that Netoge, given its genre, is ripe with unnecessary fanservice. The girls will all bath together, making vaguely homosexual comments about each other and comparing their breast sizes, with huge amounts of steam covering their bodies so that otaku will be manipulated into buying the uncensored BluRay version. How many more years will it take until the anime industry matures beyond this?)\\n\\n\r\nEvery male besides the protagonist is depicted as a horrible loser with no hope of finding love. His group of male friends (who, by the way, were even less of an otaku than him) do nothing but envy his apparent success with the ladies, despite him being entirely bland and average and without anything that would make the opposite sex interested in him. The protagonist is the single most important character in a story, and here he is the least interesting. I get it-- the girls need to be cute in a harem series, and so they might take a higher priority, but that is still no excuse for making the protagonist a lifeless sack of nothing. I suppose the one thing that can be said in his favour is that he isn't entirely dense like most other protagonists in the genre, and actually makes an effort to go out and get things done. He could be worse-- he could be, say, Ichika from Infinite Stratos.  \\n\\n\r\nNetoge tries to go for a similar art style to No Game No Life, with its blue-coloured outlines, although, quite thankfully, it does not try to assault the eyeballs nearly as much as did NGNL and its excessively bright colours. Interestingly, Netoge shows the MMO gameplay from both the player's perspective (with sprites similar to Ragnarok Online) and from some sort of fantasy (a la Sword Art Online) presumably going on in their heads. If it truly wanted to appeal to the audience's nostalgia for these sorts of games, it could have done without the latter. We don't need to see random online girls having their boobs bouncing against the protagonist's arm. The real-world side of the story already has enough of that.\\n\\n\r\nUnless another lame harem anime is something you absolutely need in your life, Netoge is something to be avoided. It is completely manufactured, playing the genre trope for trope in order to manipulate a few poor souls into paying money for it. You're better than that. You deserve better than something like this. Heck, anime deserves better.\\n\\n\r\nIn a few weeks' time, nobody will even remember Netoge. The next generic light novel harem will roll around, as always it does, season after season. Will anime fans ever get sick of them? Perhaps. But I sure don't want to sit around and wait.",

Others, however, manage to find comfort in the very middle by just \u201cbeing there\u201d, not picking a side and not making an impression good or bad enough tobe properly labeled at a glance. These get glossed over easily enough that one would really have to be paying attention or actively looking to notice them.\\n\\n\r\nSuch is the case of \u201cNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?\u201d, \u201cAnd You Thought There is Never a Girl Online?\u201d, simply shortened to \u201cNetoYome\u201d. It's your typical \u201chigh school ecchi romance comedy light novel\u201d adaptation, fit for its particular audience that picks it up every season and manages to enjoy them despite the problems that plague the genre. And yet at the same time, it's one of the more tolerable ones. There is nothing infuriating about it while still not being special enough to fully stand out from its fellow ecchi light novel crowd. You could say it's the wallflower of ecchi light novel anime, the one you notice at the corner of your eye, yet aren't willing to ask for a dance. Well, maybe this time, you can make an exception to try just once, or at least give a wave to acknowledge its presence and make it feel more welcome.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Hideki Nishimura is a regular in the MMORPG called \u201cLegendary Age\u201d as a knight named in-game \u201cRusian\u201d, and has been in a few guilds during his play-through. In one such guild, he came to like a particular player and confessed his love for that character in-game and asked to marry them. The player behind the character revealed she's actually a he in real life, and out of shock, he vowed to never trust another female character in-game again. But it doesn't stop him from meeting a new character, a cleric by the name of \u201cAko\u201d, and after a bit of inner conflict with himself, they marry in-game. One day, as suggested by the guild leader, the Alley Cats decide to have a meet-up in real life, revealing much to his surprise\u2014and near-disbelief\u2014all three of his party members (two of which are male characters) are girls who go to the same high school. And as it turns out, Ako truly is Ako (full name Ako Tamaki), and she has fallen in love with him like she did in the game\u2014if only because she can't differentiate between online fantasy and reality. Thus, Hideki, the tsundere Akane \u201cSchwein\u201d Segawa, and the student council president Kyou \u201cApricot\u201d Goshouin work together to help her out by forming a club while the two in-game lovebirds find themselves growing just as close in real life.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a simple premise, there's nothing more to it than what is listed in the paragraph. You do get character interactions with each other both in the game and in real life (to show their online counterparts aren't too different from their actual personalities), but that's as deep as it goes, even when occurring characters come in-and-out as they please (and showing a strange male-to-female gamer ratio in-series, but whatever). It's a romance, and a sweet romance at that, which for an ecchi rom-com light novel adaptation, it's to be expected, and it knows it's nothing more than that. And yet because it's simple and sweet, there's a special charm to it that makes it refreshing for the genre. In fact, despite being an ecchi, it's not your standard ecchi fare of \u201cmain male protagonist and his harem get into sexual slapstick mishaps with cheesecake shots for the camera\u201d. The closest it ever got to this was in the obligatory beach episode, but the roles were actually switched. It was just the characters having fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real conflict throughout the series is Ako's inability to tell apart online fantasy with the real world, but there was an episode dedicated to a hacker infiltrating Hideki's account that caused a temporary rift between him and Ako while also practically deleting his character and selling all of his inventory for a quick buck. The character of Rusian does get restored, but not with his items, so for the rest of the series afterwards, there's brief discussions about such-and-such item still being missing, Rusian and Ako remarry, and the hacker gets confronted in a strangely amusing but admittedly smart way, then that's about it for the hacker subplot. \\n\\n\r\nIf there had to be a problem with the story itself, it's that Hideki's trouble with trusting girls online, which is what kickstarted the anime, goes away pretty early on when he comes to terms that not everyone's what they seem to be behind the keyboard. So he doesn't show too many trust issues throughout the series as originally believed, which may or may not be a good sign depending on what you were expecting to happen. It's not like with \u201cGirls Bravo\u201d in which the main protagonist is allergic to girls, so there's no jokes at his dispense over it during and after. Akane more-or-less is the only one who really pushes his buttons, but that's because she developed a reputation as being the popular beauty who turns down every guy who asks her out despite being bit of an alpha bitch (more-or-less to hide the fact she's a gamer), so she has to keep that title in the school.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Personal opinion here, but Ako is one of the most precious, if not adorable characters this season, albeit in personality and design. Sure, there's always that possibility her na\u00efvet\u00e9 will get on people's nerves (and given how mo\u00e9 she is, that's to be expected), but there's something innocent and a little sweet about the way she views her relationship with Hideki. She truly loves him even though she sees him as \u201cRusian\u201d and calls him as such much to his chagrin, and the other characters are concerned enough about her lack of social life that they want to help her overcome it. And the odd thing is she's a very pretty girl, one would think she'd be popular with the boys in school. But she's not. No one gives her the time of day because she's painfully timid and probably doesn't take great care of herself at times. She's Tomoko's sweeter twin sister who's inexperienced with video games, if you want a comparison.\\n\\n\r\nHideki is your typical male protagonist in that he's the nice guy with no real distinct personality to call his own, especially since he's quite the otaku so his friends at school tease him about. He shows genuine care for his guild (which extends into real life the best they can), but especially for Ako since she's the newbie of the group. And yet, there's something charming about him. By himself, he's just there, but together with Ako, they form a nice dynamic that allows him to shine a little brighter than he could've. It's not the best way to write a character, however, the relationship is definitely there and cannot be overlooked without forsaking the lifeblood of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAkane and Kyou are of their respective archetypes for the most part, but they work fine together with Hideki and Ako and thus that keeps them from being the \u201cslightly more than a background character\u201d characters. Kyou's the guild leader (reflecting her status as student council president as well as a rich girl), so she's the most level-headed of the group, but she has her moments as well. Akane's sharp attitude causes some bickering here and there between her and Hideki, but as the tsundere, it's to be expected, and since there's no romance between them, it's for good fun. She's pretty much their ace in the guild despite Hideki having some of the best items, and is usually the first to go into battle.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters show up, but Nekohime and Sette are more-or-less the only recurring characters. There's honestly nothing more to these characters than what they're introduced as even after becoming regular members of the Alley Cat guild, but there's an actual funny punchline behind Nekohime's identity, at least if you're not paying attention.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: Of all the shows I personally watched this season, \u201cNetoYome\u201d is one of those shows with a distinct art-style that makes characters pop in their beauty and attractiveness (even with the occasional bounciness of the girls not Akane, though she makes up for it with leg shots). Not entirely sure how much of Hisasi's influence there is in the anime, but Akane Yano knew what to do as the character designer. It's a very colorful, pretty show to look at, and I hadn't noticed too many quality dips during its run. Colors also have different palettes for the real world and the online world. There's more color to the real world than in-game where it's more gray and saturated, but that's probably because most of what we see in-game are the characters in the dungeon or in a pub where they hold their meetings. Not that the game itself doesn't have color, when the characters are out in a field or in the village, it is bright and there's like a rainbow filter in the backgrounds, but it's noticeably not the real world. The tone also changes much more in-game than in the real world, where everything's calm and normal, if only because other guilds tend to drop by and pick fights with Rusian when they're not battling a boss (which aren't of bad quality themselves). \\n\\n\r\nI'm not one of those folks that goes around proclaiming \u201cthis cinnamon roll is too good for this earth\u201d or \u201cI want to protect that smile\u201d, but I can make an exception for the latter because holy crap these characters have lips and they have adorable smiles that makes the eyes look sparklier than usual (which says something since they have rather sparkly eyes to begin with). Protect that smile at all costs, it's too precious for any other show but this one.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Admittedly, I haven't paid too much attention to this, so this'll be short. There is a FUNimation dub currently streaming, but I haven't yet listened to it to really give thoughts on. The original is fine if you ask me, but there's nothing too special or note-worthy outside of Rina Hidaka as Ako. She knows how to make the soft-spoken character adorable, and thus her voice stands out the most in this show. Everyone else is fine, I have nothing against them. As for the music, the soundtrack doesn't really stick out to me that much outside of violins, bells/chimes, and electronic beeps, but it's not bad. The OP is sugary-sweet in setting the tone of the \u201c1st Love Story\u201d, and the ending has some nice, calming beeping effects in the music I actually like. I may never remember the name of the song, but I could most definitely pinpoint it to this series since those notes give off this \u201cInternet\u201d feel.\\n\\n\r\nBut I must point out that in the MMO world, swear words when spoken are censored with oinking sound-effects, which is pretty funny. I thought it was because of the \u201cSchwein\u201d character, but it affects all of the characters even though Akane swears the most.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \u201c[Don't] Judge a book by its cover\u201d is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot, but there's a lot of truth to it while there's plenty of exceptions. I don't know what exactly it was about \u201cNetoYome\u201d that I was interested in from the start, but most likely it was the attractive art, and I had no other expectations for it. I'm just as skeptical about the light novel adaptations as the next person, especially as I haven't had too many good times with a lot of them (the last ecchi rom-com light novel adaptation I had watched peeved me off, after all). This isn't even my favorite show of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet somehow, it wormed its way into my heart and made itself comfortable. It's too endearing to bother asking it \u201cYo, why're you here?\u201d, so I just let it be, and I've grown content with its company. It'll probably leave at some point down the road, but I see it sticking around for a little bit or going off to join the likes of \u201cMy Dear Marie\u201d, \u201cGingitsune\u201d, and \u201cDenki-gai no Honya-san\u201d in the \u201cSomehow I Liked This Enough to Acknowledge Its Existence a Bit More Regularly Than I Technically Should've\u201d corner. Either way, I definitely wouldn't mind a second season if they choose to do so. I'd like to see Ako become more socially active and further develop her relationship with Hideki, since it's not too often you get an anime couple willing to develop and grow together prior to the third act of a series.\\n\\n\r\nBut no, really, protect that smile. Go ask that darling Ako for a dance and make her feel loved and welcome. Wallflowers are beautiful when they finally open up.",

            "content": "When first saw this anime on a Facebook clip, I thought, \"Hmm, looks like another SAO, ill watch it when I have time.\" Now fast forward like 5 weeks, I had time to watch. After seeing the first 3 episodes this instantly became my favorite anime of this season. Not only was there extremely relateable MMORPG references, there was so many jokes made for the avid MMORPG Player who has no social life. \r\nStory 10/10: Because i have 0 experience with love, and this anime is basically a love story, i can say, its basically the most perfect romance ever. Like meeting a girl thrua game and then having a relation irl? Maaan, i only could WISH that happens to me. Thru my eyes, this is the most ideal and perfect love story ever.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: They do well with the fight scenes, lots of bright scenes that are done quite well and darker scenes that transition smoothly. There is a slight vary of character art styles but it looks similar enough and still very well, especially Ako's.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I can't say the intro and the outro are amazing, but the anime it self does not repeat much sounds. The music that plays when the characters are about to do a dungeon raid in game is pretty good, others are just \"ok.\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Lets start with the obvious. Ako Tamaki is my waifu now because of her character. Moving on with the other female characters. Theres a few others and the anime seems to explore their character as well, you start to find them all quite likeable. Now the male mc. In most anime, when i see a male mc doing well with girls, i usually cringe kinda hard and start to hate them. In this anime tho, the male is quite likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: Well lets see, after being mc-kun in my own story that took place in Runescape, seeing someone else perfectly replay my story is quite the enjoyment. Most \"funny\" anime put a small smile to my face, this literally can make me laugh out loud.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: I'm going to start playing mmos again and try to live mc-kun's life now.",

            "content": "Netoge is the type of show where it\u2019s pretty much every school, game tropes, and roleplay coming together in one package. The English title is \u201cAnd you thought there is never a girl online?\u201d The first thought that popped into my head reminds me of the second season of Sword Art Online. To sum it easily, it\u2019s a show that blends fantasy and reality. From the real life perspective that shifts into the MMO world, Netoge is probably a show you\u2019ll enjoy if you\u2019re familiar with storytelling related to such themes. Otherwise, this could just be another blend LN adapted series that serves no morethan eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the show should be taken more as a comedy, almost like a type of satire. Because let\u2019s face it, the show itself isn\u2019t based on characters playing as saviors to defeat some overlord or escape after being trapped in some alternate world. The main character Hideki Nishimura goes by his in-game name \u201cRusian\u201d and apparently finds out that his wife from an online game (Legendary Age) is also a girl in real life. Take this further and soon, he realizes that all the guild members are classmates from the real world. And they are all girls! I think this ties back a bit where Rusian needs to reevaluate about what he learned. Luckily, Rusian\u2019s classmates accepts him as who he is because like him, they are also gamers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one particular gamer seems to have difficulty of differentiating between fiction and reality. Meet Ako Tamaki, the girl that proposed to Rusian and now is technically his in-game wife. The problem is that she takes that idea too far and also considers Rusian her husband from BOTH worlds. Most of the comedy comes to reality when misunderstanding develops between the duo. Because let\u2019s face it, these kids are still in high school and getting married at their age is almost unbelievable. Plus, Ako has somewhat of an obsession toward Rusian, like the way a clingy wife does when they are lonely. Judging on Ako\u2019s character alone, she genuinely seems like a kind person with a bit of an airhead-like behavior and lack of common sense. Perhaps she spends too much time online and her ideas about relationships reinforces that. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the majority of the relationships focuses on Ako and Rusian, there are times when other girls step in to show their knowledge about gaming and real life. Characters such as Akane often tries to get Ako to be more herself rather than an in-game character. Kyo Goshuin, the leader of the Alley Cat guild (also student council president) plays the role of a commanding leader. As such, she often serves a big sister to the other characters and bears a lot of responsibility on her shoulders. But needless to say, these characters are still one dimensional. Ako gets jealous like most wives tends to do when other girls are flirting with their \u201chusbands\u201d, Akane is the classic tsundere, and Kyo is pretty much a walking billboard of fan service in-game. Rusian is perhaps the only normal character with some common sense. Despite that, he still get dragged into various affairs whether he likes it or not.\\n\\n\r\nA portion of the enjoyment coming from the show is the humor. The story itself isn\u2019t well written as it mostly focuses on the life styles of these gamers but the comedy can be quite fun once you get sucked into it. What does that mean? It generally means try watching the show with an open mind. Every episode mixes in a variety of ideas from gameplay mechanics, relationship dynamics, and sometimes nonsense that transforms into absurd humor. While the show\u2019s story lacks on most parts to explore relationships, it does give a decent meaning to Ako and Rusian. The duo accepts each other more and more throughout the story and in one episode, Ako\u2019s trust towards Rusian is proven after a malicious incident. This is characterized by Rusian accepting Ako for who she is (both in-game and out in the real world). The reality is that Ako is a timid girl and Rusian may be the first person to be honest about what he likes in her. While the couple is silly to watch, there is a genuine heartwarming feeling about them as well.\\n\\n\r\nOn the downside, I think the show overemphasizes on their relationship with minimal characterization about the others. Nearly every episode shows Ako getting girly with Rusian. She even has yandere-like moments when another girl approached Rusian. Akane\u2019s role in the series can be rather annoying to watch as she constantly denies about her gaming lifestyle from the public. At some point, those scenes feels like it\u2019s taking on TV time. The only tolerable female character out of the group may be Kyou (Apricot) She even sets up a club to unite gamers and tries to help Ako connect with reality. Unfortunately, her role in the show (particular when in-game) shows she\u2019s more of an eye candy rather than a role model. \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, the artwork of the show. When I first found out that the original source was drawn by an H-artist (Hisasi), I was already rolling my eyes. While the anime is tamer than the light novel, the series still has fan service. The prominent example is the in-game design for Kyou where she wears little clothing to cover herself. Ako isn\u2019t far off as there are times when she\u2019s goes full nude because of her lack of common sense. There\u2019s also the classic beach episode with skimpy swimsuits. In one particular scene, Rusian gets hounded by three girls at once to help him \u201cput the lotion on\u201d. Artistic wise, the show is fairly average in terms of quality. Nothing too impressive but also not atrocious either. The in-game character designs are perhaps what stands out the most while their real life counterparts is nothing special.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is one of the lesser noticeable parts of the show. The OP and ED theme songs does characterize what this show is about on paper. Character voice mannerism is moderate although listening to Ako\u2019s voice makes her sound like a child on most occasions. Akane\u2019s tsunder personality is clearly evident in her voice as well. There are also some occasionally sad and heartwarming moments with a surprisingly decent soundtrack to bring it together.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished this show, I pretty much thought \u201cok\u201d. Because quite honestly, I think this show is fine as it is. If it stretched more, it\u2019ll feel dragged and quickly gets old while rushing isn\u2019t doing the source any favor. Ako and Rusian\u2019s relationship can be a mixed bag for most viewers where at times, they can be really fun to watch while other times feels like it\u2019s a chore. But in retrospect, Netoge is what it is, with nothing great but also not so easily forgettable either.\\n",

            "content": "Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta had a very interesting concept, plot, story and more importantly nice cast of characters. \r\nI think what I liked most about this title, the story specifically, is that no matter what episode I was watching I always had some sort of sense of enjoyment. Seeing the characters progress through certain events both inside and outside the game. I think that character development & growth was a big part of the story due to each character having some sort of social problem however, I'd like to discuss this more in the character department rather than story. \r\nSuddenplot development and story development, I felt like the way both were introduced came off as weak and somewhat uninteresting.. The lack of exciting new developments in the shows story-line actually made me less excited to watch new episodes. The drama along with new issues in certain episodes could have been resolved within a few minutes maybe the first 11 minutes of a 23 or 24 minute episode. This however was not the case and because of that a majority of the problems that the characters had made it feel like some episodes were slow and boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt looks pretty great. Special effects looked great when used properly and the overall character designs were fantastic. I can tell that the producers and animators were going for the moe look with the girls because they gave them bigger eyes and tiny lips. \tPersonally I think that this was a very smart idea, especially for the character Ako since she's like the main female character. The producers knew that we were going to be seeing Ako the most, so why not make her look even more appealing. All of that aside costumes, daily outfits all looked alright to me. The only issue I had was the show was really bright. \\n\\n\r\nI used three different methods of watching Netoge. I tried using my samsung 48 inch 4K Smart TV and the results just weren't that great so I tried using my computer monitor on \"Economic\" so it could dim down the brightness. Lastly I tried using my 42 Vizio TV and just didn't get the results I was hoping for. In the end though, I just had to deal with the strange brightness in the show.Other than that, the art and animation was pretty great. \\n\\n\r\nOh the soundtrack. I honestly didn't care too much for the soundtrack. The background music just lacked intensity and sometimes it felt dull. The ending song was the only song I liked. I felt that it imagined a better picture of the romance between Ako and Rus was all about!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters stood-out in a good way! In my opinion, the shows biggest working department is character development. As I mentioned earlier I believe that character development was much more important than actual story and plot in Netoge. This is because just about every episode focused more about certain characters issues... you know who I am talking about (cough Ako.. cough..) and how that said person is going to grow from it.\\n\r\nLastly, the girls were super cute & adorable and Hideki was a pretty decent main character.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall feelings and enjoyment for the title were a little above average. I loved the fan-service, I liked the characters, and the story was engaging. There was a considerable amount of action that kept the story exciting. The character development kept the show refreshing and the special effects were great!\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? deserves its 8/10 for introducing such a creative story as well as nice characters.\\n",

Now a week later I can say that this show has become one of my all-time favourites. \r\nNow I'll be the first to admit that this show does heavily follow cliches of it's genre, but really thats not an entirely bad thing as it does those cliches very well. From the characters to the story, even if I had seen it before somewhere else, this show just does it better. That said even when the storydoes cliches well, it's still not that strong and if you want a good story, don't come looking here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters though, that is where the show shines like a diamond. The characters despite a few being cliche, are all incredibly enjoyable and fun. Ako, the main girl is probably one of the most adorable and endearing characters in any anime I've ever seen. This same general sentiment can be applied to all major characters, they're endearing and they grow on you to the point of loving them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style of this show is yet another thing I love about it.All the characters and backgrounds look good. This animation coupled with the good sound design go a long way to tell me that there was actual effort put into this show. \\n\\n\r\nI love this show.",

            "content": "Here we are, another Robert's Too Late Review coming right for your brain! Today we are going to step into the world of Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? Or 'And You Thought There Was Never a Girl Online?' for us thick-tongued people. Goes without saying to read the synopsis, minor spoilers, so forth, but a couple of other things should be noted as well: I am running the dub version, and I have NOT seen more than a few episodes of Sword Art Online. From what I gather from friends and other sources, there is a lot of comparisons between animethat have the whole 'gamer' angle and SAO. So without that experience, or having seen any other video game based show, I will be reporting from 'virgin' eyes I guess you could say. \\n\\n\r\nI've been a gamer a very long time. I remember playing Space Invaders and Cosmic Ark on the Atari 2600. I was young, but there when Mario became super for the first time. Back when the word 'Nintendo' was synonymous with all video gaming. I'm still a huge gamer, I have Doom (2016) getting a Steam update as I write this, and have spent time in the Final Fantasy series in the past 24 hours. I point this out to give you insight about where I'm coming from, as a viewer. Let's get to how the story is impacted by what a person might know, or not know, in relation to gaming. Also we have to see if anyone in the series deserves a spot beside Tifa Lockhart on the RTLR wall of girls!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe main thrust is a kind of overused one in my mind because the idea of having to draw someone away from the internet, and gaming in general, was a HUGE deal when I was a teen back in the '90's. Parents everywhere were afraid their children were becoming zombies by playing too much. We were constantly inundated with messages about the (give me a spooky sounding voice here) dangers of video game addiction! It was so bad that at one point when the first ISP opened in my hometown, they actually refused an unmetered connection. Not because they didn't have the equipment or tech to allow it, but because the owner felt it was his personal duty to defend the purity and innocence of the town at large. Can't have everyone running around playing Doom (original) all night long! He even once bragged to me about monitoring the network so closely that he would kick people off if he felt they 'needed it'. So yeah, I know all about the whole 'game addiction' thing. I'm not going to argue about if its as widespread as some say or anything political like that. I'm just saying, yeah, I've heard just a few times about how people can 'lose themselves' to the game.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue then becomes, this is kind of what the anime is all about, helping a young girl who is more socially active and outgoing as her character in an MMO game than she is in her incredibly anxiety and shyness-filled real life. So why would I even watch this series? I tell ya, I have very few reviews on here that are negative. I was ready to watch this show and beat the ever living hell out of it for being stereotypical and asinine. But then, the first gaming joke dropped, and I laughed. Then an old school reference popped up, bringing back memories of games past, and I was suddenly hooked. The sly (and sometimes blatant) little nods to the gaming community and in-jokes and such were fun to look for, and the story is a lot lighter than I expected. \\n\\n\r\nI remember back in the days of AIM and ICQ ruling the interwebs long before anyone took an arrow to the knee, and I can recall chatting people up and getting little crushes on them before realizing that back then, the banner across the gateway to the internet didn't say \"FACEBOOK GOOD\" instead it said \"Welcome to the internet where men are men, women are men, and children are undercover cops.\" So finding out someone you thought was totally your type of girl was actually a burly man old enough to be your father was a common experience. I remember too, as the show references, how badly you beat up the asshole who shot around indiscriminately when 'cleric needs food BADLY!' These kinds of nods and such were great, even if the story is a harem anime dressed in game trappings. \\n\\n\r\nThe gang don't just work to pull the young girl out of the game, they all learn to balance their lives in meaningful ways, while having fun ribbing each other over different things, just like friends do. And that's the point of it all, really, is that they all became friends, not only in game, but in life as well.  As I said, this is a harem show, at least in the sense that there is only one guy basically anywhere to be seen, and the rest of the cast is female. Now the young gamer girl is 'married' to the guy in the game world, and seems to extend that view to the real world as well, so she's totally harem type material. There's another who is played by the wonderful voice actress Jad Saxton (of Koneko from DxD fame) who is, of course, very standoffish. A few more girls and even a teacher round out the group, though we don't focus as much on romance in any meaningful manner than we do to the more comedic stylings. And unlike many harem type shows, only young Ako seems to be attracted in any manner to the main guy. \\n\\n\r\nWhat we get is a cut between the group doing real life things to either help young Ako come out of her shell, or to build a stronger bond between them all as guild members in game, or they play and do things like help newbies and engage in player-versus-player action. The main guy does develop feelings for the young girl Ako, but we never see a real resolution to the relationship, at least not in a satisfying actual in the real world kind of way. Ako dotes on her 'husband' even in real life, but even after the guy confesses to her, we don't see any kind of romantic bloom happen. And one would think it would be easy, as Ako is VERY devoted as the in-game 'wife'. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is fun, and full of references to gaming in general, and some of them are on the older side of things which makes them really fun for us older gamers (and younger retro players too). The Konami Code even makes an appearance, and I was waiting for Leroy Jenkins to run by shouting about to whose bases are belonging to. But overall, we're looking at a series that strives to show that life isn't all about gaming, but it's not all about sports, or grades, or hobbies, or even anime (quit throwing things at me!) but instead it's about all the things we love in our lives, and how we can come together and learn and build friendships we didn't even think was possible. The high school nerd and the snotty teen queen can share experiences and actually come kind of close to being friends! A often repeated line is \"Real life and the game are totally separate!\" But in the end, they're not. Not really. Everything about you makes you who you are, not just one interest or hobby or talent. Everything. And if we can learn to see each other as people and not as just these narrow definitions, then the world could become a better place. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI loved the art in this one! Ako is so kawaii she almost hurts my eyes. I like the way each character looked, even if they were a little over the top. The colors are nice, the in game equipment looked passable. My biggest complaint, and it deals a lot with Ako, is the style of mouths they chose to use. When the Master of the guild (and student council president, of course) and Ako both smile, they just have this weird upturned look to their mouths. And at one point there is a kiss scene, and if smiles looked bad, the 'pucker' for the kiss went into dimensions of weird not even I can understand. Other than that though, I found this series easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe intro music is fun, and I didn't mind much the ending theme either, so passable in both instances. The in-show music was well done, and often sounded like a video game should sound, with tension or levity as needed. The voices are pretty awesome. I like Jad Saxton's work a lot, so its always nice to hear her in a show. The master and a later party member are pretty well balanced for their particular roles. The teacher acting as the club advisor was nicely voiced as well EXCEPT for in-game, where she becomes Nekohime and, ugh, meows every chance she gets. The main guy sounds solid, not too overconfident. He sounds like the kind of guy that would in fact give a helping hand to a new player. I liked his voice a great deal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, Ako, the gamer who refuses real life, is terribly cute, and if you didn't notice there's an 'ecchi' tag on the genre list there to the left, so she's pretty damn stacked too. She is a bit of an oddity in that she has no real world social skills, but is basically a kind of Leroy in her own right, not having much of a clue in game either, running around drawing monsters, and getting everyone killed on accident. But it seems that her lack of playing skill is counterbalanced by her ability to socialize far more easily than she can face-to-face. We never learn of how the guild they are in started, but they all had to be outgoing enough to come to know each other, as finding out they are all at the same school is a shock and such. Ako is understandable, at least for me, as I often prefer my contact with others to be through this medium of the internet than in the real world. I'm actually painfully shy as well, and tend to duck behind others and mill at the back of crowds to avoid interacting with any more people than I absolutely have to. I think this is becoming far more acceptable in a way by the proliferation of social media. Many of us have Facebook friends we might not have had a real world visit with in years. Many have friends they've never met in real life. Ako's social anxiety is understandable, even if she's drawn in such a manner to be very suggestive and attractive. Even the pretty people can have social issues, or mental health problems, or those kinds of things. Those things come in people of every shape, size, and level of attractiveness. \\n\\n\r\nThe high school queen, the one voiced by Jad Saxton, has an interesting arc of having played and known the main guy online for a long time, not knowing that in real life she was quite rude and kind of bullied him. As they come to understand each other, work together to achieve goals, and just hang out, she lets her guard down in real life, and decides maybe she doesn't have to be *quite* so mean to the nerd. This is somewhat of a counter point to Ako, Ako comes out of her shell by interacting with the real word where queen bee comes out through the route of in game friendship. Even though she softens a little, she's \"one bad mammajamma!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe master of the guild and student council president is interesting in that she's a rich girl and uses a bit of the 'pay to win' mindset that many gamers really hate. She takes her premium gear and moves from being a bit of a show off in the beginning to using her funds for the benefit of the guild, and to bring enjoyment to her friends. Also, when she's in game and in her 'outfit' she appears to not have any nipples, as she only wears two strips of cloth hanging down each side of her body. Not that I was closely watching those parts or anything....\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do tend to come off a little on the 'one note' side, with the rich girl master, the queen of mean, and the busty bimbo, but it's not to the point that it saps much from the entertainment value. This anime is not about character building or weaving fantastic tales, its about gamers for gamers, acronyms and all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI did not get rick rolled one time watching this series, and I laughed out loud several times at some of the jokes. It was a fun ride, pretty predictable, but the easter eggs and gamer-service left me feeling like it wasn't a total waste of time. I imagine I'm going to watch this series again at some point just to see if there were any jokes or nods related to gaming that I missed the first time around. It was just a fun show about playing games with friends, and growing a little as you go along. I give it a thumbs up just for empty-headed Ako!\\n\\n\r\nSo if you've ever teabagged a camper or rocket jumped or set an alarm for a raid schedule, you might find things to enjoy here. Ako makes the RTRL wall of 'this game happy end'. I would write more, but I took an arrow to the wrist.",

            "content": "Even though this is just a one big wish fulfillment series, this show is actually one of my guilty pleasures. I'll explain somewhere below why I enjoyed this show so much. \r\n(There will be slight SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (5/10)\r\nBefore I watched this series, several people have warned me that this show is just a wish fulfillment harem series. While the wish fulfillment part may be true, this show is, in no way, a harem. If they were making jokes/making fun of the series then I would get why they would call this series a harem but on a technical standpoint, it's completely wrong. Adefinition of a \"harem\" is when 3 or more girls gains feelings or are in love with the main characters, which is not the case for Netoge since only 1 girl is in love with the MC and the MC later gains feelings for her. Also, what is it with anime and their ridiculous long-ass titles?\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the story is fairly simple. A dude named Hideki Nishimura plays an online MMORPG called \"Legendary Age\" and one day, he proposed to a female character online but it turned out that female character was a guy in real life. Nishimura, disappointed by this ordeal, swears to never trust another female character online ever again. Hence the title, because he's going to be eventually surrounded by girls later on in the series. \\n\\n\r\nSince this show doesn't have much of a story...Well, besides that arc where Nishimura and the club members decided to help Ako by making sure she can distinguish between a reality and fiction, there's really not much of a story here. The rest of the series are just otaku-pandering, fan-service-ecchi moments. Of course, one should not forget the obligatory \"beach episodes\" and the hot-spring episodes. If you enjoy that kind of stuff then Netoge has it all for you. Even though I don't enjoy fan-service moments, I admit that I did laugh watching those scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's comedy not only focuses on fan-service but the show also makes jokes about MMORPG and as a fan of video games, I welcome the jokes and I thought they were pretty funny. For example, they made jokes about the MMORPG's micro-transactions, Roles in MMORPG's like a Tank, Healer, Magician and how the characters misuse them and etc. If you don't play video games, let alone, a MMORPG then the jokes might fly over your head.  \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show's Romance and I'm glad the MC decided to accept Ako's feelings for him instead of mindlessly being f*cking dense and I'm also glad the girls didn't want his dick. This show would have easily turn into a harem because its got the right elements but the author decided not to go the harem route *phew*. Though, I wish Ako and Nishimura kissed at the end. I mean, it almost happened but it's one of those cliche moments where they got interrupted by someone or something. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nWhen I first watched this series, I got this weird feeling. The character designs felt like some characters that I'd usually see when I'm watching Hentai except the characters here were more shiny and glossier. It turns out that the character designer for Netoge is a famous Hentai artist or some shit. The heavy emphasis on the character's lips and mouth pretty much gave it away. The visuals' pretty amazing though. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OSTs are nothing special. They sound just like the regular soundtrack that I'd regularly hear in some ecchi/rom-com anime so it's not worth talking about it. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"1st Love Story\" by Luce Twinkle Wink. This OP sounds almost exactly the same as Oreimo's OP, in terms of the tune and the chord progression. Hell, even the singer sounds like ClariS. *sigh*, Originality is overrated anyways. I'm surprised that ClariS hasn't sued their asses yet..The ED theme song is \"Zero Ichi Kiseki\" by Yoshino Nanjo. Ehh, it sounds ok. There's really nothing special about the ED. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (7/10)\\n\r\nSo I enjoyed the show because of its comedy and the amount of references that this show makes to the MMORPG genre but one final thing that I enjoyed about the show is its characters. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, the protagonist, Hideki Nishimura a.k.a Rusian, might seem like a typical harem MC at first but he later turned out to be a likable character because he wasn't a dense fucker who drooled at all the girls around him. Later on, in the series, he noticed that Ako's feelings were true and he started gaining feelings for her. Though, that doesn't mean that he's not completely like a typical harem MC, because he still is.......somewhat... He still has one of those aspects that you'd normally see in a harem MC like him being nice to girls, being surrounded by girls but the only difference is they don't want his dick like Ako does, and he gets all embarrassed and/or act likes an idiot when he see's naked girls.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ako, which in my opinion is the best girl of the series and probably the best girl of Spring 2016. Ako is a female otaku who loves to spend most of her time playing video games while she's holed up inside her own room. She has trouble socializing with people and with her own classmates and she hates \"normies\" (I'm pretty sure you can guess what a \"normie\" is).  In other words, she's your typical gamer who fits the \"gamer\" stereotype. A shut-in gamer who has trouble socializing and hates the real world. This does give her room for character development because Rusian and the gang will help her solve her issues and you'll see her character change from being a shut-in gamer who doesn't want anything to do with real people to someone who managed to make friends and is somewhat able to notice the difference between a reality and a fiction. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Rusian and Ako who received character development, the other girls in the gaming club didn't really receive that much development or only little development. I feel like they were just there for plot device or something to help Ako and Rusian get together but nonetheless, they were still a bunch of interesting characters who made me laugh. There's Akane Segawa, a member of the gaming club and a tsundere. Man, the anime harem standards corrupted me because I was expecting her to gain feelings for the MC and I thought she was going to be a part of a harem but that didn't happen, thank god. There's also Kyou, a student council president who doesn't have friends (What the fuck?!) and she's completely like how those \"freemium (free and premium)\" players act. Kyou is easily one of the most funniest character in the series because of the way she acts. There's also two more members but introducing them is a major spoiler so I won't cross that line.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nWhat I thought was another trashy harem series that was going to go into my pile of harem garbage anime turned out to be a completely enjoyable non-harem anime series with MMORPG elements that made a gamer, like me, enjoy this series a whole lot more. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nNetoge turned out to be one of the series that I looked forward to every week last season because the comedy was hilarious and I really loved the jokes that they made about the MMORPG, especially that whole micro-transaction jokes. It may not be the best series out there but it was an enjoyable show to watch due to its comedy, the use of MMORPGs and of course, the romance. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (7.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+The series turned out to be a non-harem series\\n\r\n+Romance aspect of the series was enjoyable to watch\\n\r\n+The show's comedic aspect is hilarious\\n\r\n+Enjoyable cast of characters \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Fanservice, Fanservice, and a whole lot of Fanservice\\n\r\n-Not much of a story in the series\\n",

            "content": "This wonderful Rom-Com, was more than sarisfying in story and visuality. The proposition of a guy who's lost his desire to be any kind of normal, he has totally given up on a life of romantics, both in reality and in real life. He is fully set on that \"Games and Reality are separate!\" too quote him personally. But, alas he still gets married in the online game called \"Legendary Age\" he treasures so incredibly, just to find out his so called \"wife\" is a girl even in reality, and a beauty to top it off! They even go to the same school! Unfortunately, thisgirl can't distinguish her games from reality... Therefore, she thinks they're married even in real life. No matter how you look at it, this girl has got some screws loose!\\n\r\nHe struggles immensely with trying to teach her how to refrain from combining games and reality, however it does not prove easy...\\n\\n\r\nI have watched through the serie partaking in the story and it literally nailed me to the couch! It is incredibly artistic with both scenes for the sensitive girls to the game-addictive males. As I've written above it's a fantastic Rom-Com, which means it has it' moments, where it'll make you laugh, and where it makes you cringe, but hey! When has a serie not made you cringe at least once? Never! Exactly. So, therefore I really recommend it for most of the Anime-watchers out there, of course not everyone will like it, but that's just life. Everyone has their distinct taste in Anime, Games, and so on..\\n\r\nWell anyhow! To me this was definitely a Masterpiece!\\n\\n\r\nThat concludes this review. Hope you will also enjoy it! See ya!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I used to play World of Warcraft heavily, I would always set aside time for a female Draenei player that I fast befriended.\r\nWe would often just sit in Ironforge, using the emote phrases to goof around or talking to one another in our party chat. I was not smitten with her, but, being a teenage boy who managed to form a close bond with a girl who also had an interest in the same exact hobby, I will not lie and say I did not enjoy making her laugh.\r\nI never did learn much abouther, though. If she had her own family or what her age was. In fact, I cannot even say for certain that she was a girl.\\n\\n\r\nThat situation \u2013 a male playing a female character (and vice versa) \u2013 is a strange and possible one that comes with the territory, and, depending on the people and feelings involved, it can make for some awkward and embarrassing moments.\\n\\n\r\nNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? shows this outcome all too well.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nNetoge (needed to shorten the title at this point) stars Hideki \u201cRusian\u201d Nishimura, a high-school dude who plays the new hit MMORPG Legendary Age. After mustering up the courage to ask an in-game (cat) woman to marry him, said woman reveals that she is actually a he in real life. Completely taken aback, Rusian chooses to never trust \u201cgirls\u201d online ever again \u2013 until a certain healer confesses to him in return.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show\u2019s title and its opening set of sequences may lead one to believe that the game itself is the primary factor, that notion is hardly the case. True, the show attempts to balance both elements \u2013 the game world and the real world \u2013 throughout the season. But, when the magic subsides and the shield is lowered, Netoge is very much more focused on life outside of the game.\\n\\n\r\nAko makes this idea more than obvious. An entire club is dedicated to rehabilitating her uncommon warping of the two worlds she inhabits. Study groups are formed, classes are skipped to support a girlfriend, and dangerous, criminal activity is (almost fully) carried out.\\n\\n\r\nIn focusing on the real, Netoge impresses upon not just Ako but also the audience that life is different than a game. Not that life isn\u2019t like a game, for it can certainly feel that way sometimes (e.g., getting a \u201clucky drop,\u201d learning a new skill, etc.). But rather, life, in contrast to any game, has consequences, reactions, and outcomes that have purposeful impacts on both the person and the people around him or her.\\n\\n\r\nThis idea is nice, but, unfortunately, Netoge seems to forget its own premise. The whole \u201cno girls exist online\u201d motif quickly gets dropped beyond the fourth episode or so since Rusian and Ako become (more or less) a couple.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for the need to differentiate reality and the game. Once their club becomes official and the anime finishes with the introductions, it focuses more on the romance and the game itself. Both of which have their own issues.\\n\\n\r\nFor the romance, it is simply weak. Not very many personable moments exist between Rusian and Ako, and, even when they pop up, they almost always get exploited for comedic or non-serious developments.\\n\\n\r\nFor the game, it does not hold much relevance. As was said, reality is technically more important, but the anime does not contrast the two sides enough to accentuate either. Take what the characters normally do: talking at a table in their local tavern rather than adventuring.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc is particularly strange. It drops the focus on Rusian and especially Ako in favor of this cultural-festival dilemma. Yes, the game finally takes the forefront as opposed to being just a \u201cbackground\u201d element, but the conflict itself does not serve either the point of the narrative or even the characters themselves. No matter how game-centric it all happens to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that the ecchi material \u2013 some nakedness here, a bath scene there \u2013 has next to no meaning for Netoge beyond existing for viewing pleasure. I.e., the sexual content is, overall, unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the disparity between the game world and the regular world allows the anime to champion the notion that just because something is not \u201creal\u201d does not make it any less valuable. Winning a tough fight on their own or falling in love are just as real as watching fireworks beneath the night sky or receiving some words of encouragement from a close friend.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of where the events take place.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nNetoge falters hardest when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the character designs are pleasing. Glistening eyes. Attractive figures. Lots of vibrant colors (e.g., pink, orange). It also helps that the anime (at least near the beginning) had some cleverness in the portrayal of both Schwein and Master\u2019s male, online personas. Master\u2019s outfit becomes particularly risqu\u00e9 as a jab towards female armor in video games, and Ako\u2019s frilly, pink dress suits her cutesy character well.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the designs, however, Netoge encounters trouble.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the anime does not have much diversity when it comes to what actually goes on in the game world, the backgrounds and locations within Legendary Age are sparse. When in doubt, the show continually goes back to the same corner of that local inn, and, even when the crew does manage to venture elsewhere, it is more than likely lots of stone walls, open plains, or other low-detailed areas. The opposite of a video game.\\n\\n\r\nThe regular world is (relevantly) similar. Netoge shows parts of the school\u2019s classroom and hallways, the clubroom where Rusian and the others play, and the road leading back to their homes. Otherwise, differing locales are rarely shown. And since the designs are so nice, they make the dull backgrounds that much more obvious.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the simplified look of the game (when seen from the real world) and the real-life, Ako-featuring between-shots in the interlude for the A and B parts of the episodes (which is quite meta) add flair where it is desperately needed.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation also fails to hold up. The first couple of episodes, where Ako moves in happy or silly ways, is evident, but, the further along the anime progresses, the choppier the animation becomes. The fight scenes do not have much choreography, the characters are usually just sitting or standing without a lot of hair or eye movement, and the anime simply does not have a lot going on to get its characters moving.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the girls\u2019 breasts; those never stop bouncing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nA case can be made for Netoge being an anime about Rusian. After all, he warms up the audience first with his failed attempt at romance. The rest of the season sees him at odds with his newfound \u201cnever trust a girl online\u201d philosophy as well as his budding relationship with Ako.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime goes from being about \u201cfake\u201d girls online to participating in some guild battles \u2013 which subsequently take away from the relationship building and the main motif of the anime itself. Altogether, Rusian\u2019s character does not have much going for him.\\n\\n\r\nSo, perhaps obviously, the anime isn\u2019t so much about Rusian as it is about Ako.\\n\\n\r\nAko starts off in a rough spot. Shy and a recluse, she rarely speaks to anyone at school let alone has any friends she can confide in. So, when their group chooses to officially meet offline for the first time, it is clear how ecstatic Ako is to finally be with people that she can at least hang out with.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, she is not exactly of sound mind, for she does not see a distinction between the game world and the real world. She believes Rusian is her fated husband, she refers to Segawa as Schwein, and she does not tolerate \u201cnormies\u201d whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nHer inability to separate the two worlds causes Rusian, Schwein, and Master to band together to form the Net Game Club in an attempt to curb Ako\u2019s delusions for good.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, that does not happen. She believes Rusian\u2019s confession \u201cdemotes\u201d her from wife to girlfriend, and, more startlingly, she does not seem to care much for anything outside of the game because, to her, the game is all that matters.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, she does not swing from one end of the spectrum to the other. But she does, however minimally, escape from her constant, reclusive lifestyle. She starts going to school more. She goes on a sleep-over with the other girls. She hangs out with Rusian and the others at the beach during their summer vacation.\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, Ako\u2019s relationship with Rusian is both supported and tested. He visits her house, letting her see the lengths he would go to for her. She instantly recognizes Rusian\u2019s imposter, demonstrating her close connection with her hubby. And they get remarried (in game) in front of all their friends.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, Rusian and Ako do not follow through on that pivotal kiss. It is also obvious that Ako still has pretty much the same mindset about both worlds being intertwined. And that\u2019s perfectly okay. For where everyone else seeks to explain to Ako that the two worlds are separate, Ako argues (and, indeed, represents) the idea that both worlds are not so different.\\n\\n\r\nYes, she can get a bit crazy at times, wanting to go all the way with Rusian (in private chat) without a second thought or choosing to reincarnate when Rusian is being \u201cstolen\u201d from her. But that does not make her own perspective (entirely) wrong. To her, the relationships she holds with those online do not lose their authenticity when viewed offline. In other words, the game and reality are one in the same.\\n\\n\r\nHaving both sides of the argument \u2013 that the two worlds are both different and the same \u2013 gives Netoge some clout. Unfortunately, when the final arc arrives, it strangely pushes Ako out of the limelight, reducing her chances at further development and missing out on more exploration for this topic. Nevertheless, her whole character is easily one of the stronger parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else \u2013 namely Schwein, Master, Sette, and Nekohime \u2013 they exist purely to help Ako and, by extension, Rusian. Schwein provides the harsher way of looking at the situation (with the occasional sentimental moment). Master supplies them with the gear and the opportunities. Sette gets right to the heart of the matter. And Nekohime simply guides them all from afar.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that Ako and Rusian are the priority, it is acceptable that they do not do much else. However, they do not get a pass when it comes to their own interconnections. For while Ako and Rusian clearly hold a tight bond, it is hard to say that about any other pairing.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, though, they do hold a commonality between each other: anti-social skills. Schwein desperately wants to lead a normal high-school life, hiding her true passion for the game and her \u201cbad self.\u201d Master, despite her student-council-president title, does not talk to anyone. And Nekohime does her best to connect with her students, but nothing can match the adoration her fan-made guild holds for her.\\n\\n\r\n(Sette is the odd one out because she already is the odd one out. As a non-gamer and straightforward person, she has no trouble interacting with her fellow students.)\\n\\n\r\nDoes this make them strong characters? Not really. Mostly because the anti-social angle for them is not so much a prominent theme as it is just a detail to get them all together. But it is still nice to see that, game or not, they are there as friends for one another.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nNetoge has a peculiar issue: it relies too much on the cut-music-away-for-comedic-effect technique. For many of the different jokes during the season, they will build something up or go a certain direction \u2013 only to halt the building or directing. With the shift comes an immediate drop or change in the music being played. It\u2019s a common technique for the medium, but Netoge does it so much that it becomes noticeable and therefore distracting.\\n\\n\r\nToshiyuki Toyonaga as Rusian is likewise a problem. Not that his voice acting takes away from the show, but pieces of dialogue are not as strong as others. When he jumps from an aircraft, his hollers and excitement come off as unamused, and, when he gets mad (often declaring that \u201cthe game and reality are separate\u201d), his anger does not have the oomph, the irritation behind it to make it believable.\\n\\n\r\nRina Hidaka as Ako and Inori Minase as Schwein thankfully make up somewhat for his missteps. Ms. Hidaka gives Ako a happy, cute voice that fits the bubbly girl well, and Ms. Minase strikes the tsundere persona with ease.\\n\\n\r\n(As a side note, Schwein\u2019s little piggy sound that sometimes played when she entered the frame or did something noteworthy was a nice touch.)\\n\\n\r\nSome of the tracks from the original soundtrack are also worth noting. The main romantic piece, with its soft piano and sentimental tone, makes it hard not to smile when it is played. The acoustic-guitar track is likewise uplifting. And the little bit of transition music from the A and B parts of the episodes is nice, too. However, the hip-hop track that gets used regularly does not fit the setting and atmosphere of the anime, hurting the OST\u2019s overall strength.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening and ending tracks, they are a mixed bag. The OP is not very flashy, relying mostly on a pop tune, steady pacing, and somewhat flat singing. The ED performs better with its techno sound-effects and slight variance in pacing, but the singing, once again, is not all that impressive to hear.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why I liked this one: Ako and the romance.\\n\\n\r\nAko was cute when she tried hitting the ogres frantically or when she was overjoyed to finally meet the real-life Rusian. She could be funny, too, when doing karate chops in the air or when she made it sound as though her night with Rusian was lewder than what it actually was. And she was kind, accepting the craziness of the others without reservation.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance made it all that much better. Tiny moments like Rusian buying her ice cream would make me smile. But grander ones, like when Rusian visited her in her room and gave her his full support, got me audibly \u201cAww!\u201d-ing on multiple occasions. (Also, that room scene had one of my favorite jokes: where Ako\u2019s yandere tendencies almost manifested as urine for tea.)\\n\\n\r\nI do wish the other characters were more fun, though. Schwein could be silly when Sette discovered her secret, and Master believing that her affluent lifestyle was normal could get me to laugh. But they did not have much of a presence, both influence- and personality-wise, throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? provides a thoughtful, if misguided, experience. The contrasting worlds and Ako\u2019s character are strengths of the show, but the subpar animation, the underdeveloped romantic relationship, and some sound-related issues are obvious weaknesses. It\u2019s an entertaining anime, but it lands in awkward territory \u2013 with or without female Draenei in the equation.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, while focus gets lost and the heart of the romance beats irregularly, the disparity between the game world and the regular world, and its theme on realness, make the narrative more than just a bunch of comedy and ecchi scenes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, nice character designs, a more-often-than-not boring artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Ako develops as a character and counters the others\u2019 view on their two worlds being separate, with Schwein, Master, Sette, Nekohime, and especially Rusian supporting Ako along the way\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, bad OP, okay ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and a repetitive comedic technique\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, still liked the romantic elements and Ako especially, but Schwein and the others were not too memorable\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

Some twists andturns occur and they me meet in real life, proving his in game wife is indeed a solid 9/10 on the loli index\\n\r\nThere isn't a harem tag for this anime, but let me be clear the MC is a weakling and what do we know about weaklings,they make perfect Harem MC, its a proven fact\\n\r\nBut after the first episode the story develops into something more than just boy meets girl but rather a heart warming story of friends trying to break the line between game and reality that Ako is blurring\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack : Nothing much to say here, average cutsie music, you definitely won't be contemplating life listening to it\\n\\n\r\nAnimation : Usually i don't mind animation because i'm all about the \"plot\" but i have to say the colorful scenery and the camera work really bring this anime to life\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : This is where this anime shines. Right of the bat we can relate to the MC, qwerky loser that can't talk to girls but is a horn dog. The only thing we cannot relate to is the fact that the MC seems to be skinny, and let's be honest viewers of this anime can't see our toes anymore. What makes a Harem great is not what the MC can do but what the women do\\n\r\nWe have our tsundere, simple not over the top but is there for some quick laughs . We got our president, again simple and not memorable\\n\r\nOther women trying to get a piece of our MC but again not memorable, except my pink haired goddess, what a babe\\n\r\nBut lastly, we got our main wife, and she is amazing, she is the embodiment of our worldly desires, her VA really portrays what we think our wife would sound, when we become a wizard at age 30.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it, as a veteran gamer i can say there aren't any girls that play video games, wait no, there aren't any pretty girls that play video games\\n\r\nWith this anime in hand, we, as the viewers must appreciate this anime of the season. I can safely say, this anime is a must watch for all mmorpg, loli, harem, chicken breast lovers. \\n\\n\r\nWith the completion of this anime i would have to say i'm disappointed  with the lack of harem and the absurd amount of censoring of the bresticles \\n",

Only problem was that 12 episodes was too short and the ending seemed slightly rushed. 13 episodes would have been perfect to wrap it all up although i'd have been cool with 20+ also. Your typical slice of life/school romance comedy anime although with a unique twist in regards to the storyline. Yes it had your standard Online gaming theme in it as well however it's take on it was different from other anime in this genre and quite comedic that kept me smiling throughout. No it's not top tier in its art or animation andif i had to break it down piece by piece it would probably be a 6 but my overall enjoyment of this anime is what made me give it a 10 for the simple fact that its a feel good anime that makes you happy and keeps things interesting each episode. Would recommend for anyone who likes romantic comedy anime",

The story takes place in this modern time, so don't look for mechas or magicians, magicians can be found only in the scenes where our \"main characters\" are playing an MMO game named: Legendary Age(LA). The game revolves around the whole, at least most of the whole anime. Reminds me of SAO, anyone? Except that here they dont put on headset but playing in safe of home before the monitor. Our main characters are studying on high-school somewhere in Japan. And of course, all main characters are playing that game, some of wich will be added in the time. If you want to know more read the damn synopsis or go watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nI know, the animators was trying but... its not getting 8/10. It has some good points but, somethimes I was just like WTF...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\r\nNot bad, not bad at all. Suprisingly it didnt sucked...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nI dont wanna talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nProbably, somebody in studio: Project No.9, was thinking about: We should be more focused on character, if we do bad story it doesnt matter till the people watching it will like our characters. (For me, bad decision)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I ended up with this anime, I was like: Yeah good, saw another anime, lets watch another one... One last thing. Why this anime is suggested as ecchi anime? Just sayin cuz ecchi scenes took only 0.005% of the time at all... Watch it if you want, I can assure you its not that bad... maybe...\\n\\n",

            "content": "Being unable to discern the difference between fantasy and reality is a fear that many a critic of games and other fictional media frequently purport. You see it on the news every now and then, how someone committed a murder that mimicked an event they saw in a game, and that violent fiction spurs one on to commit villainous deeds since they don't realise that it actually has some real life consequences. Yet little do they touch on the other effects that it might have; they only latch onto and showcase the most awful examples in an effort to definitively prove their case. Netoge noYome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? (And you thought there was never a girl online?) is a fun little anime that touches on this in a more positive spin. Centring on a group of highschool gamers going by the online monikers of Rusian, Ako, Schwein and Apricot, Netoge explores - in an albeit exaggerated and comical fashion - some of the other issues and events that might arise should one struggle to separate their gaming world from the real one. \\n\\n\r\nAfter deciding one day that the four of them should meet up in real life, they're all shocked to discover that not only do they all live in the same area, but they all know of each other already, as they go to the same school and share many classes. Whilst making their initial meet-up both awkward and somewhat easier to deal with (it's less daunting to meet and talk with people you know than with strangers, after all) it brings with it a slew of issues and problems, the biggest of which is immediately brought to light - Ako, the Guild's newbie healer, cannot separate fantasy from fiction. It is first seen in her naming convention - Rusian is called Hideki Nishimura in real life, Schwein is called Akane Segawa, Apricot is called Kyou Goshouin, and Ako....is called Ako Tamaki. Unlike the rest, she has not bothered using a different online name because she doesn't consider there to be any difference between Legendary Age - the game they play - and the rest of the world. To make matters yet more problematic, Ako and Rusian are married in LA, which she then considers to be carried over when they finally meet up, immediately clinging to his arms and addressing him in a far more intimate fashion than people usually would. \\n\\n\r\nThis provides the basis for the vast majority of the content that follows. Ako's inability to discern between pixels and reality becomes a focal point for the group, as they all decide to form a gaming club to try and help Ako out of her problem. It is not so easy as that, however, since Ako is undescribably dumb. This is also where my opinion on this anime split - whilst it managed to be somewhat entertaining and comical with all the misunderstandings and problems that Ako made, it also served to act as a point of contention because her idiocy was at times excessive, and completely halted the plot from advancing. This was especially prevalent in the relationship between Ako and Rusian; Netoge really had a huge chance here to separate itself from other harem-esque highschool anime much in the same way Rakudai separated itself from Asterisk - they could have went for an actual relationship, but decided that Ako was so deluded that she already considered herself Rusian's wife and therefore didn't need to accept a confession of feelings from him.\\n\\n\r\nI felt really quite disapppointed at this particular aspect, because the relationship route is seldom tread in this type of anime and thus is one which I absolutely root for - pun not intended. The flipside to Ako's delusions, though, were many of her other actions and misdeeds - such as assaulting her teacher when she mistakenly believes Rusian is cheating on her with their sensei in the game, or how she was completely non-plussed when Rusian walked in on her when she was naked - Hell, her reaction was actually brilliant in that particular scene because she was happy about it. It ends up being an arbitrary toss up between which scenes I enjoyed and which I didn't; at times her delusions were handled in a funny manner, but other times it just seemed overly exaggerated and dragged out for the sake of it. \\n\r\nAs far as all of the characters go, they're a mashup of previously seen tropes but have their own little spins on them for the most part. The aforementioned Ako plays the role of the romantic main girl, as Nishimura the person, not Rusian the character develops feelings for her pretty soon off the bat. She's rather ditzy, and refuses to accept things for what they are. Everyone else bands together to try to help her out of her predicament.\\n\\n\r\nRusian is the lucky male who gets to spend all of his time with his female guildies. He's fairly typical as far as male harem-esque MCs go, but one thing that sets him apart is the fact that he is actually true to his feelings and confesses (multiple) times. It was a breath of fresh air to have a high schooler who wouldn't just freak the fuck out over even the thought of confessing.\\n\r\nSchwein plays the role of the textbook tsundere character (who bears a striking resemblance to Lieseharte from Saijaku). However, in the game she is a very self-confident player; she refers to herself as 'ore-sama' and her overall gaming persona is vastly different to how she acts in person.\\n\r\nApricot - dubbed 'Master' by the rest of the crew since she is the guild leader - is the student council president at their school, and is considerably wealthy. She uses that wealth in order to be one of those pay-to-win filth by buying all the best gear, weapons and consumables. Her family's success also leads to them having many properties, including their own private beach; all of these residences she owns become, at one point, a staging post for them to try and wean Ako off of online gaming. In this respect, the obligatory beach episode actually makes a lot of sense since there was some context behind it. It made the inclusion of such a clich\u00e9 much better.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, since there's a beach episode, you can expect lots of fanservice, and there's a healthy amount of it throughout the anime. The handling of it, however, is a positive thing from my perspective - a lot of that fanservice felt either very natural or was used for comical purposes. The natural fanservice occurred in the game. For anyone who's ever played a fantasy RPG, you'll know that female gear is typically quite revealing, and much of it is like that in LA too. Apricot's entire top half is uncovered, aside from two lines of fabric which cover her nipples, the rest of her boobs spilling out around it. There're other times when the characters show a lot of flesh, such as Ako being found naked by Rusian - yet despite how that trope normally plays out, Ako's reaction was \"Please, be gentle with me!\" The little twists on the typical tropes and clich\u00e9s made it a fair point more entertaining than what it would otherwise be. \\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice was also bettered by the series' art - it certainly made all the characters look cute and attractive. It reminded me a lot of Aishen Qiaokeli-ing, what with how huge the eyes of Ako were and the colour palette in general. It worked much in the anime's favour because of the decent aesthetics. However, one of my personal issues with the art style is the way that the bottom lip for the female characters is drawn on but the top isn't. The result of this is that everytime the characters have their mouths closed, it looks like their bottom lip is being pulled over their top lip, and once I noticed it I couldn't stop seeing it. It seems like a small thing, but when the characters are supposed to be attractive, seeing such a weird-looking lip ruined the effect to a certain extent.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, it brings you to the question of \"Should I watch Netoge?\" I'd say for those that like harem-esque anime the answer is a yes. It might include a lot of the stereotypical traits of other anime of this type, but it's got enough of its own unique touches to stand aside on its own two feet, and if you like those tropes anyway then that's even better. It doesn't have an overriding plot such as saving the world or fighting off an evil organisation that plagues many other similar series either; having it revolve around a bunch of gamers make it feel a lot more natural, even if it's still exaggerated. But it's not without its own problems. As previously mentioned, Ako's issue of being unable to discern fiction from reality was both funny and annoying. I became rather disappointed in the middle of the series when it could have progressed, but instead decided that Ako was such an idiot that absolutely nothing could be done to salvage her. In that regard this series could have been much better, and I would have been inclined to rate it higher. It still remained funny and light-hearted throughout, though, and for gamers it's somewhat relateable. You can have those little chuckles to yourself when you see the similarities in the anime to stuff that's actually happened to you before, such as how Ako is the token useless female who's only in the guild because she's in a relationship with one of the main players - oh, that brings back many an argument... \\n\\n\r\nBut it was a fun ride, even if it could have been better. Attractive characters (if you can ignore the lips), comical situations and throwbacks in gaming. A fairly standard series that has a few little perks to separate itself from the rest of the pack.\\n",

            "content": "Hello everybody! I hope you've all been having a fantastic day, because today, I'm going to talk about what is probably one of the cutest anime you'll ever see. A show about MMOs and the girls who play them. A show who's name is so long I do not feel like saying it, but will anyway. Yes, I'm going to talk to about netoge no yome wa onnanoko ja nai to omotta, or And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online? God that was a mouthful.\r\nWe begin our story with a young woman confessing her love to the man of her dreams, only toget shot down. Don't worry. This is all happening online. Fortunately for us, our young heroine isn't quite ready to give up. When her confession is rejected, she decides to go for broke. (Add video audio). That's right, Ladies and gentlemen, she figures that if he's going to reject her confession, then they should just get married.\\n\\n\r\nI really have to hand it to Project No. 9. When they first created this series, I didn't think it was going to amount to much. My thoughts were along the lines of, \u201coh, this is just gonna be another Sword Art Online or Log Horizon.\u201d Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike either of those anime, but I didn't think this series was going to contain anything original. I have never been so glad to be wrong. While I wouldn't say And You Thought There is Never a Girl Online? Brings anything new to the table, I feel like there are enough original twists on used tropes that I didn't get bored with the series. In fact, I enjoyed myself far more than I thought I would.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Hideki Nishimura, an open otaku who spends a lot of time playing the net game, Legendary Age. He, along with three other people, have formed a guild within the game called Alley Cats. His other companions are Schwein, a confident swordsman with a weird catchphrase; Apricot, a mage who spends a lot of money buffing his items and weapons, and also the leader of the Alley Cats; and finally, Ako, his loving in-game waifu.\\n\\n\r\nOne day, Apricot decides that they should meet each other IRL. When Nishimura goes to the meeting place, he is shocked to discover that not only are all of the people in his guild women, but they all go to his school. Coincidence? Of course not. The plot devicing is strong in this one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my joke, I really enjoyed this series. I don't think there was a single episode that I watched where I wasn't smiling. I was greatly impressed by the humor. All of their jokes were not only well timed, but they were also funny. I'm not lying when I say that the humor found in here was probably some of the best I've seen in a while. The only anime that was funnier was KonoSuba, but it would be exceedingly difficult to beat that series when it comes to RPG gamer jokes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere were two jokes that I found particularly outstanding. The first was when Ako decided to quite school due to a misunderstanding. Hideki goes to her house to talk to her, but he ends up meeting her mom first. He's then given a key to Ako's room. He goes up to Ako's room and they talk for a bit. We hear some bumping noises in the background, followed by Hideki telling Ako that he's coming in. Ako tries to stop him, but he doesn't listen, and then unlocks and opens the door. Ako is practically naked.\\n\\n\r\nNow, walking in on a girl while she's naked is an anime trope that's been done to death. In fact, having this trope is almost like a right of passage for generic harem anime. What made this scene funny was how they subvert the trope by putting an original twist on it. First, the door is locked. In anime, whenever the main character walks in on a girl when she's either changing or taking a shower, the door is always unlocked. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe the girl's just don't think the main character is capable of opening doors, or maybe it's just a poorly disguised plot device to show some censored boobies. Whatever the case may be, I like how the door is locked here, and the main character unlocks it and enters anyway. The second subversion of the trope is Ako's reason for being naked in the first place. She likes to feel free and uninhabited when she's in her own room. What makes this interesting is that there are actually people who are like this. In fact, when I'm at home, I generally don't wear much, and sometimes I don't wear anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe last subversion of the trope is when Ako tells Nishimura that she's ready, and he opens the door again, only to discover that, rather than putting her clothes back on, she has taken what little she was wearing off. While this has been done before, what made me laugh was how Ako feels like it's a perfectly normal response because they're married in-game.\\n\\n\r\nThe other joke that I liked was the pee joke, and I don't think I need an explanation as to why I found that funny.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the comedy in this anime is often hilarious, this series is not without its more touching moments. There are many instances where the characters deal with real life issues, and while some of these problems are exaggerated or overemphasized, I think a lot of people, gamers especially, can relate to the quandaries these characters face.\\n\\n\r\nI was particularly interested in Ako's problem. Ako is a person who has trouble separating reality from the video game. In fact, the entire premise for this anime is that Ako is so absorbed by the game world that she assumes what applies in the game also applies in real life. A good example of this is how she thinks Nishimura is her husband IRL. Not only does she think they're married in both reality and the game, but she even calls him by his in-game name of Rusian when they aren't playing, thereby informing everyone that when she looks at Nishimura, she doesn't see Nishimura but Rusian instead.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Ako and her reality issues, my next favorite character is Akane Segawa. I'll admit that a part of me likes her just because her voice actress is Jad Saxton. I've loved her voice overs since she played Suzuka Dairenji from Tokyo Ravens. However, I also feel like Segawa's character is the strongest personality wise. Unlike the other members of her guild, Segawa is a hardcore gamer who wants to have a reputation in school as a normal high school girl. It's like she wants to deny the part of herself that loves net games, but she can't give them up, which is why she turns down every boy who confesses to her. Having a boyfriend would mean less time to game.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Akane and Ako, the other four characters to note are Nishimura Hideki, Kyo Goshoin, and the two supporting characters Nanako and Yui. While none of these characters are bad, I felt like they didn't have as strong of a personality as either Akane and Ako. That said, I still had loads of fun watching them. Kyo, who plays Apricot in the game, is the daughter of a wealthy family. She spends crap loads of real money buffing her in-game weapons and armor. She's also the spearhead for the get together, and the one who forms the net game club so they can hang out at school. Meanwhile, Hideki is technically the main character. I say technically because he gets the most screen time, but in truth, Kyo, Ako, and Akane also play pivotal roles in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the cute story, the anime isn't anything especially spectacular. I do appreciate the artwork, and the animations were good enough that I certainly won't complain. That said, while the artwork was lovely, this series isn't going to win any awards for it's animation. It was just okay, and honestly, I don't think it needs to be anything other than okay. Where this anime really shines isn't with its animation and artwork, but with its characters. For people who enjoy playing video games, and especially online games, it's easy for you to feel a sense of kinship with these characters. Aside from all of them being very likable, they also make me think of myself when I went to high school.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who love video games, I would highly recommend giving this series a watch. You can watch it in either subtitles or dubbed. While I usually prefer subtitles to dubbing, I honestly prefer the dubs for this anime. I believe the VAs had a really strong showing here, and the jokes made more sense to me dubbed than when I had to read subtitles.",

The whole anime is meant to create a variety or characters who each take different (and often opposing) standpoints on gaming and helps to make the characters feel more unique as well as creating interesting dialog. I personally love the plot of the show but believe that the ending has a weak buildup and during the end their choice to focus actual story time onthe game was a wasted effort considering how generic the game they play actually is. Other than the occasional moments where they focus more on the game and less on each other this anime has a pretty solid plot and some minor character development that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing special about their IRL appearances and even less so in the game where everything is generic and bland.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe dub and sub are both terrible voiced and the music in too repetitive and indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the bad animation and delivery I overall enjoyed it.

I couldn\u2019t help but assume that the series would turn out to be clich\u00e9. Well, I turned out to be half wrong. The series does have its fair share of clich\u00e9s, but it also tries to challenge them. Maybe not to the extent of Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, but it tries. It handles its premise nicely and it manages to bring up real life gaming problem and situations without feeling surreal. And at times,I get some genuine chuckles from this series.

The story is about a boy named Nishimura, who virtually marries a girl named Ako in an MMORPG, and later ends up meeting her and his guild in real life, only to find out that they\u2019re all from the same school. The series then revolves around these main characters and their daily life with the MMORPG, and how they can make Ako differentiate between reality and the gaming world. There\u2019s no real main story in the series and the main goal for the characters (helping Ako find the difference between the two worlds), is so vague that it feels non-existent. However, it\u2019s fun seeing the characters go through different situations. Though the writing is a mixture of both a mixture of comedy and drama. There will be moments when the series takes a humorous approach towards situations, but there are moments when NetoYome tackles real life situations like hacking. Though the plot never goes anywhere, and it seems like the characters are still on square one by the time the series ends.\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThe most impressive thing about NetoYome is the fact that it\u2019s not as generic as it looks and sounds. It\u2019s quite refreshing to see an anime with one male lead and many females as main characters, without it being a harem. Even though it\u2019s labeled as a romance, there\u2019s not much romance too it. Ako and Nishimura\u2019s relationship is used more as a comedic relationship than a romantic one. As mentioned before, the series manages to tackle some pretty important themes and the series can take a serious tone at time. That being said, the series is at its best when it\u2019s lighthearted. Ako\u2019s addiction for that MMO and he unyielding love for Nishimura is what makes this series shine. That being said, the series heavily relies on her character for content. If viewers don\u2019t end up liking her as a character, chances are they won\u2019t like the series as a whole because she is the backbone for this series.\\n\r\nPresentation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bad as some of them are likable and nice, while others feel like wasted potential. Our protagonist, Nishimura Hideki, is an alright main character. His relationship with Ako is entertaining enough and some of his remarks are quite funny (like when he entered Ako\u2019s room for the first time). That being said, it would have been nice if his reactions were more over-the-top (similar to Kazuma from KonoSuba), because Nishimura never ends up being memorable. Tamaki Ako ended up being the most likable and most memorable. She is the poster girl of this series after all. Her lack of common logic and her inability of differentiating fiction and reality is what makes this series so much fun. And her yandere mode, which was present near the beginning of the series, is fun. The rest of the characters, however, don\u2019t end up being memorable in any way. Segawa Akane feels like wasted potential as she never played a major role in anything and Goshouin Kyou is just there so the anime can have a \u201cwise-senpai\u201d character.\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art is quite good in NetoYome. The character designs are quite neat and unique in some ways. The characters normally have lips (well, at least the lower lip) and it really makes the characters stand out in appearance. Nishimura\u2019s design is quite bland and it doesn\u2019t make him stand out, but Ako looks great. Her messy hair and lack of wearing tucked-in clothes add to her careless characteristics. NetoYome makes sure that you can judge what type of character Ako is by just looking at her appearance, just like how you can do that with someone in real life. The backgrounds in the series is also quite good looking, and the game world looks nice too. The art style is quite unique too. Especially during the game moments, the anime features an art style with more bleached-out, pinkish color with heavier outlining. Personally, this art style made the series look better.\\n\r\nArt: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation quality in NetoYome is decent and is consistent for most of the time. It\u2019s nothing too special, but it works. There wasn\u2019t any noticeable moment where the animation quality dropped. That being said, there isn\u2019t any moment in the series when it would be challenging for the studio to animate it. Most of the series is just standard talking and walking, and even during the fantasy/game world moments, there aren\u2019t really any big action scenes when a good amount of effort needs to be put in. But the studio does the basics and does whatever they do properly. It\u2019s consistent and fluid, and that\u2019s all that matters. \\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast in NetoYome aren\u2019t the most well-known, yet they manage to do a very good job in what they have to do. Some shine more than others, but overall, it\u2019s a good cast. Toyonaga Toshiyuki does a good job as Nishimura, as he manages to make Nishimura sound funny whenever he gives his opinion on a comedic situation. It\u2019s nothing extraordinary, but it\u2019s fine. Hidaka Rina did a fantastic job as Ako; it\u2019s spot-on. She manages to make Ako feel like a careless and illogical character, while making her likable and somewhat adorable The rest of the cast, such as seiyuu like Ichimichi Mao and Minase Inori, do a satisfactory job in their role. It\u2019s nothing too great, but it works well. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in NetoYome is alright, but I was hoping for something more. The OP, \u201c1st Love Story\u201d, is pretty decent, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m with listening to it once. Nothing too special, though it remind me of Oreimo\u2019s OP. The ED, \u201cZero Ichi Kiseki\u201d, is quite good though. The music is average, but the vocals are nice. The background music is quite lackluster though, as none of the music ever stand out. They all feel very average in some way. For a game that also focuses on a fantasy setting, one would have expected some likable tracks, but unfortunately the series is lacking that. Sometimes the OP music is used as music, and that\u2019s far better than their own original soundtrack. \\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nI liked NetoYome a lot more than I thought I would. I think I liked NetoYome more than I should. It\u2019s got some obvious flaws, such as the series going nowhere, both is story and character relationships, and it\u2019s got a fair share of clich\u00e9s. But it\u2019s the characters (primarily the two main leads) and the handling of their concept that makes the series so much more than it is. It might have very well been the biggest surprise of this season for me and for many people that are watching some seasonal anime. If this series ever gets a second season, I\u2019ll definitely be on board. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta is worth checking out, even if you aren\u2019t fans of the genre. Don\u2019t be turned off by the ecchi tag as there\u2019s not too much fanservice in the series, and unlike what the key visuals make you think, it\u2019s not a harem. That being said, there\u2019s not much romance in the series so don\u2019t keep your expectations, on that aspect, high. NetoYome is funny and interesting at times. The series also manages to tackle some more serious problems, with their humor added in. It would\u2019ve been nice if the Ako and Nishimura\u2019s relationship developed more, but\u2019s it\u2019s fine the way it is. After all, there\u2019s only so much you can ask from a ecchi light novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n+ The two main character are likable and have a good chemistry \\n\r\n+ Genuinely funny at times \\n\r\n+ Handles and focuses on some real life tech and gaming problems. \\n\r\n+ Great character designs, as they can represent the character\u2019s personality \\n\r\n- Main story fades away and character relationships go nowhere \\n\r\n- Supporting characters feel lackluster \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.4/10",

If you think the internet is just full of GIRLs (guys in real life), then let this show prove you otherwise.\r\nIf the title isn't an accurate description, then let me summarize the plot. It revolves around Rusian, a guy who got rejected by a character in an MMORPG. The reason: the character was  guy in real life. Many of us can relate to this situation. And that's enough reason to watch the show. Then he meets another girl inthe game and then they meet in real life. And just like that, they're married. Now, this is pretty much a one-in-a-million occurrence, but it's nice to see how it might look like if couples online become couples in real life. It's cute.\\n\\n\r\nIf that's not cute enough, then perhaps the heroine will catch you eye: Ako. She most certainly caught mine for several reasons. Other than the fact that she's cute, she has a personality which is too adorable to take. A yandere willing to do anything for her Rusian. It makes you wish you had your own Ako. But life doesn't really work that way, so we can only watch this and cry to ourselves as it happens right before our screens.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest rating I gave to this anime is in the art. It's so fluid and colorful, it separates itself from similar romance anime. Although their smiles are creepy sometimes...\\n\\n\r\nI would very much recommend it to gamers and non-gamers alike. Not only does it have gaming situations which gamers can relate to, it also has scenarios which you actually want to happen to you. And you thought there was no romance in MMORPG...",

Since the most popular light novel, Sword Art Online successed at business, light novel and web-novel depicting the online games has been increasingly published for several years.\r\nThe main protagonist, Hideki Nishimura has been playing the MMO RPG Legendary Age as a male avatar named Rucian. Once, he was dumped by the female avatar named 'Neko-Hime' after heconfessed his love to her. She said that she was a man and in general a player of a girl-look avatar was almost never a real woman.

A time-killer and nothing more. \r\n[Story: 3/10]\r\nLooking back, it's quite difficult to pinpoint what exactly the plot is (although there was plenty of \"plot\", that's not what I'm talking about).\r\nNetoge is not story-driven, but chooses to focus on the comedic-slice-of-life route. Unfortunately, the comedy is very lacking, so all you get is slice-of-life.\r\n[Art & Animation: 5/10]\r\nThe art style is acceptable. Although I mostly enjoy how many of the characters appear, sometimes they do appear a bit odd.\r\nWhether you want the fanservice or not, Netoge often cuts to strange cameraangles for \"that sideboob\". \\n\r\nThe fighting scenes and such were a joy to watch, but fluidity isn't anything to write home about. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 4/10]\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs scream \"generic anime music\".\\n\r\nThey are actually...quite painful for me to listen to. \\n\r\nBut hey, if you like it I won't judge.\\n\r\nThe regular background music is barely noticeable, so I can't comment too much on it other than \"it's okay I guess\".\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 2/10]\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this anime.\\n\r\nNetoge focuses entirely on Ako, the self-proclaimed wife of Light Novel Guy.\\n\r\nAnnoying, air-headed, and most of all irrational. \\n\r\nShe is portrayed as the absorbed-in-video-games character but fails grasp simple game strategies such as skill combos. It makes little to no sense that someone would be so dedicated to video games yet lack the dedication to work harder to understand how to better themselves in-game. \\n\r\nThe other cast members are really only there to provide support for Ako and Light Novel Guy's relationship and have very little personalities on their own.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 3/10]\\n\r\nPersonally I felt Netoge was very much forgettable and made no impact whatsoever. \\n\r\nIf you end up liking Ako's character, then I almost guarantee you will still enjoy the anime.

            "content": "Netoge is an anime adaptation of a series of light novels that tries to hide the fact that is yet another addition to the harem genre. To the high-school, harem, ecchi genre to be precise. There is a Greek proverb that roughly translates to: \u201cThe prostitute wants to hide, but the enjoyment doesn't let her\u201d and that applies here; Netoge doesn't delve deep into the harem genre as, for instance, Nisekoi, or to the ecchi genre as Shuffle, but, believe me, it enjoys being in the company of both. \r\n\tContinuing on rough translations; the title means: \u201cAnd YouThought There Is Never a Girl On-line?\u201c you can probably guess that the anime tries hard to prove that notion wrong. The protagonist is the stock, average, good-natured boy, whose main hobby is playing a popular MMORPG. An off-line meeting of the small guild that he belongs in, brings light to the fact that the three other members are gorgeous girls that attend his school. What's more, one of them, his in-game wife, is a shy introvert who has problems distinguishing reality from the game and gleefully proclaims that he is her husband. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe guild manages to open a legitimate club in the high-school and eventually the number of hot girls goes from 3 to 5. Of course, no other penis-wielding character is to be found, except the mandatory scenes of envious classmates -you know the ones, those who are more akin to tapestry than actual characters.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story is non-existent, the characters inconsistent, and if you have ever watched one of those, you know exactly how much progress will be made in 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\n\tAs I said, the anime doesn't take the genre tropes too far. Also, the girls are cute, a fact that is enhanced by the good animation. Finally, the narrative mixes reality with the MMORPG's gameplay, which is an interesting storytelling device, but mainly gives us a chance to see the girls in  exotic garments, like a beautiful priestess's dress, or slutty mage's robes.\\n\\n\r\n\tConcluding, Netoge is an average series. It has some interesting elements, but it carries all the genre's problems. If you are not a fan, I'm positive you can find something better to watch. If you are a fan, well... you could do a lot worse. 5.0/10.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Netoge no yome wa onnanoko ja nai omotta. Honestly this started out alright, but it went down hill as it progressed. \r\nThe story starts off with our main character being proposed to inside of a video game. He turns down the proposal several times, but finely agrees after being constantly bother by the girl proposing to him. We soon learn why he was so against marrying her in the game. This is the basis of a odd relationship that has now formed between our main character and Ako(the girl who proposed). The remaining bit of the storyis dealing with this relationship. The show reminds me a lot of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shita. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode is generally dedicated to helping Ako come out of her shell and learn about real life and to start to see the world somewhat differently. However this isn't as serious or obviously a story like Chuunibyou. At the same time this show isn't slice of life enough to be considered and enjoyable episode to episode romp. Overall it was pointless, somewhat boring and otherwise mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. They had alot of emphasis on the lips which, to be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about. The soundtrack was fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fun at first, much like the story. Our main character Nishimura, Hideki is a gamer who is an open otaku. He proposed to a girl in a game once and she turned him down on the basis she was an old man. This of course ruined his idea of games and gave him his slogan as games and real life are separate. Tamaki, Ako is this tame yandere girl who loves Nishimura. She seems rather strange and somewhat crazy at the start, but mellows out and becomes an object to show off how nice Nishimura is later. Segawa, Akane is overly tsundere, and has an interesting revelation early about her gaming companions and her name which plays a good bit into the comedy for the first few episodes. Goshouin, Kyou is the final female main character. She is the rich student council president and she uses money to buff her in game character.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters do play parts in the story and at times the part they play can be significant but overall the ones listed above are the ones that are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime for the first 4 or so episodes. Getting to know everyone and watching as they discovered each other and had their little misadventures was entertaining. However as the plot progressed and nothing really progressed with it, I quickly found myself bored. This show doesn't really do much great. The comedy is thin, and most of the time only worth a smile or a light chuckle. The story non existent, or perhaps more kindly altered and pushed aside. Again I find myself amazed at such high scores by other reviewers.\\n\\n\r\nI do want to praise a couple of things. This show seems to have been written by a gamer. It doesn't go into the details that a game might have, but the feelings and basic outline of a gamer are clearly represented. This is a bonus because its always easy to spot when its not and that always breaks a bit of the immersion. Lastly some of the dialogue is really interesting. Its not really trying to preach to gamers nor is it designed to teach those who dont game. However it does have a few middle ground explanations moments that I thought were really nicely added.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Starts off strong, drops quickly into a boring rut. Wouldnt recommend unless you are wanting a poor mans Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shita.",

            "content": "This anime fills me with tons of mixed feelings.\r\nMake no mistake: it's a harem-type setup. A young man finds himself surrounded by extremely attractive girls, who in some ways do of course vie for his attention. The saving grace of the anime is that it's not actually harem, in that the main character, Rusian, gives his heart and attention to one girl and one girl only, Ako, from start to finish. He never gives the others a thought as anything more than as true friends. It's refreshing and sweet.\r\nWith that said, it's pretty frustrating to watch harem-like situations forced onto the anime when it doesn'tneed them. There is of course a day on the beach, which showcases each girls 'assets'. There are hints that one other girl is interested in Rusian, and he is also capable of making the last girl in the club blush, despite her supposed lack of interest. There are gratuitous panty-and-boob shots that made every single scene they occurred in substantially worse.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself was pretty good. Somewhat predictable, but not necessarily in-your-face about it. It covered a lot of ground, had very nice animation, and if you could strip away the harem-esque stupidity, the character interactions were pretty darn good. I didn't like the central relationship of the story very much initially, but it grew on me a lot. I also loved the friendship between Rusian and the token \"tsundere\" character, Akane, as she really became his best friend and defender over the course of the series--sometimes more than Rusian's actual girlfriend. \\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't a groundbreaking or life-changing anime. But it was an enjoyable one, almost from start to finish. The only thing that really harmed it for me was the absolutely unnecessary, forced harem bits that didn't belong in this anime at all.",

It's another gaming anime too, which I usually find interesting to watch. If anyone is interested into the comedy of crazy chicks who have mental problems but are gamers to the core this is your anime. The real comedy is produced by Ako, (the female protagonist) who is crazy but that's what makes her cute (in my opinion). I can relate to her factor of crazy sometimes (keyword sometimes). \r\nI loved how delusional Ako was, andher logic made me tearing up with laughter. Hideki having to put up with it all, (the male protagonist). Poor Hideki, Well I'm afraid if I speak anymore I'll give away the WHOLE anime, (it's a favorite for me) so...*zips up lips* \\n",

            "content": "Netoge is an anime that is mainly a Slice of Life anime with aspects of fantasy during video game sequences. This is a series that I guess if you're into video games (Like LoL or Overwatch or any of those type of games), then this would be a show you can enjoy. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story basically follows a group of four people (later 6) who play an online game together, who two of the players being \"married.\" They all agree to meet someday, and when they meet they all realize that they're in the same school together. The show from there basically goes with theplayers living normal lives at school but after classes, they all go to their computers to play (Spoilers: they make a club that dedicates itself to playing these games), all while the main male character tries to help the main female character separate fiction from reality (It really reminds me of Chu-2). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe one thing I remember well from this anime is the art style, which I found it very pleasing. The girls look very cute, especially their faces where you can see lips (which is rare from the anime I've seen) when they smile and their eyes have a constant sparkle. My only complaint is (as I normally complain of) is the fanservice which they show a few times, but there was a scene the involved fan service that made me laugh, so I can't complain so much on it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP of this series is one I enjoyed very much, being very cheerful and bubbly, which pretty much sets the tone of the series. The songs used in the series was pretty good and overall I thought it was very good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were good, there isn't really a character you can hate on in the series. There's Nishimura who's the main male character who enjoys video games and being an 'open otaku' but he's a sociable and nice guy that enjoys life. Ako is the main female character who's the cover girl of the series, having beautiful looks, but being anti-social and hating normies, all while wanting to live a life where she just plays video games all day and that she's supported (Essentially a housewife). Akane is the tsundere of the series, seeing Nishimura as an otaku, but she begins to have feelings towards him as they play along and gets to know his personality, as well as she's a closeted otaku and tries to hide it to her best ability. Kyoh is the calm and mature member of the group who's into video games because of her overprotective family not letting her out when she was young. They're essentially you're average otaku or geeky people who enjoy video games, and you're likely to find someone you can relate to (I myself relate to the most as Nishimura). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show pretty well, it wasn't too exciting where I was hooked on it, but it wasn't too boring where I didn't care for the plot. There's scenes I enjoyed, especially with the relationship between Nishimura and Ako (Which is something I believe many gamers wish they have, including myself). The show is something nice to pick up that you can finish quick and I'm sure each episode will at least give you a smile at some point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nFor a Slice of Life anime with fantasy aspects, it held out pretty well, the main positives was the art style and the music this anime had. This anime is likely to be enjoyed by pretty much otakus, anti-social people, geeks and video gamers, since the anime's premise revolves around that. If you want something nice and cheery, I would recommend this.",

            "content": "Netoge no yome \u2013 A modern masterpiece\r\nNetoge no yome is a sweet and light story about a group of friends who go to school together and also play videogames together. At first it looks like another shitty otaku-pandering harem show for people who still do not know how to google actual porn but, like is the case with the better type of harem shows, there is much more going on.\r\nThe central focus:\r\nThe entire main cast have one thing in common, they place a certain MMO, but the way they deal with their love for this game is very different from character to character and asexpected, this is the central focus of this story. All the important characters feel like they have to give up something in order to live their real and in-game life as they want but the show subtly tells us that it does not have to be this way. There is no reason for why you can\u2019t be smart and cool and also enjoy your nights grinding. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\nTamaki Ako:\\n\\n\r\nShe is the most interesting character. Because of a presumably shitty real life she has completely dedicated herself to the mmo. She is at a point where she does not care at all about school or her family or her relationships with other people outside of the videogame. What she gives up is her entire life and a big part of the drama of the show is based around her friends trying to teach her to \u2018come back\u2019 in a healthy way. She does not have to give up on reality just because of previous bad experiences. Even when the world forgets you, you should not forget it back\u2026 at least not just yet. That is the message the show pushes through Ako\u2019s development.\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting part is that unlike they would have you believe, Ako\u2019s friends are also deeply flawed people who are dealing with a similar struggle so in the end they are just a group of friends trying to earnestly help each other get out of the same hole because they are the only ones who truly understand each other.\\n\\n\r\nSegawa Akane:\\n\\n\r\nI consider her \u2018negative\u2019 Ako. She enjoys playing the game as much as Ako but unlike her, who tries to pretend real life is the game world, Akane tries to pretend in real life that the game world does not exist. The idea is that she wants to play videogames and also have a healthy social life but she thinks that the only way to achieve this is to hide the part of her personality that just loves playing the game. This really makes her story the saddest. She pretends to be interested in normie shit and also tries to get away from her friends just so that no one will see them together and then associate her with that group of people. Her development and message comes in the form of realizing that she does not have to give up anything about her personality to fit in, she is pretty cool the way she actually is.\\n\\n\r\nNishimura Hideki:\\n\\n\r\nHe is your typical Harem guy but fortunately he has a solid personality and is honestly pretty cool. His problem is that he has had shitty experiences both in real life and in the game world that have severed his relations with women, especially in game. He is also accused by Ako of trying too hard to separate his game life from real life and this is important. He knows that Ako loves him but for some reason he denies himself the pleasure of enjoying a healthy romance simply because in real life he can\u2019t face the fact that someone admires him. His development is all about realizing that love transcends realms and getting the courage for just being a good boyfriend for Ako. The message coming from his development to me sounds a lot like \u2018Why limit yourself to only being a cool guy in game when you are just a cool guy in general\u2019. Maybe more than half of us can relate to this, hopefuly.\\n\\n\r\nGoshouin Kyou:\\n\\n\r\nHer bad sides are her obsession with the videogame (to the point of spending a ton of money in it) and her just outright asocial behavior but honestly she is pretty cool. 10/10 would love tenderly.\\n\\n\r\nYui Saito:\\n\\n\r\nA perfect fit for this story and a role model for the main characters. She is an adult woman who enjoys playing the same game as the main characters but she is also a respectable high school teacher that honestly does a good job of inspiring her students. She has her own problems like everyone but in my opinion she is very close to the ideal this show wants to construct of being a good and respectable human being but also enjoying your hobby without shame.\\n\\n\r\nThat is all you need to know about why this show is great but unfortunately this is the anime industry so as expected some bullshit came bundled up with this story\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEcchi:\\n\\n\r\nUnlike better shows Netoge no yome does not use its ecchi scenes to make any narrative or political points and therefore is, in my opinion, just the usual eye candy for the presumed brainless otaku audience. This show has the thematic of being afraid of romance but it is not like this show tries to comment on sex or sexuality. Honestly all this fan service was out of place and takes a lot of points from this show. If you take this show and remove all the fanservice scenes then you could have a pretty good 9/10, maybe even a 10/10, but unfortunately the studio was not brave enough to trust their narrative to drive the interest for the show and needed to add ass shots and tits everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI still respect this show and appreciate everything it tried to say because it did a pretty decent job at pushing its deep narrative. I\u2019ve already seen plenty of anime about otaku or gamers being the coolest human beings in existence with no flaws at all so it really is a breath of fresh air to see something that has a nuanced perspective on this lifestyle and presents characters who act like actual people in these subcultures. That is why Netoge no yome is truly a modern masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this I give this show a well-earned 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "I can\u2019t even believe I forced myself to see the entire show just because I hate do drop shows. I always believe in giving it a chance but this\u2026 oh man, what a waste of my time.\r\nI knew from the beginning that this was just another anime embracing the gaming idea that seems too popular nowadays. However, I believed I would see characters development or anything besides the annoying fanservice.\r\nInstead, I get a story of a useless character Nishimura (Rusian) and his mentally ill girlfriend Ako with some other characters that were not really needed to this\u2026 lack of plot. \r\nSo, let\u2019s talk about Ako,one of the most dreadful characters I have ever seen. She cannot distinguish reality from the game they all play. That would be just \u201cgreat\u201d for itself but there is more. Ako thinks that she is really married to Rusian and she is so crazy and dense that cannot even comprehend a confession in the real world. She would rather live as a housewife, doing absolutely nothing with her life but playing games and pleasing her husband. There so many things wrong with her that no one in their right mind would fall in love with her. Someone normal would call for help because she needs treatment. \\n\\n\r\nI know this is not real, it\u2019s just an anime but sometimes anime give us messages or lessons about ourselves or the world around us. From this anime, no one can learn anything.  There is nothing here but a group of teenagers with problems that are not solved. But hell, there is fanservice so let\u2019s watch. Let\u2019s never forget that all gaming girls are hot and want to put their breasts on your face. Yeah, that\u2019s a lesson. Another one would be, as long as you are gaming, there is no need for a real life or studying. Life if good, let\u2019s just aim to be the perfect housewives and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was fine but wasted on an anime like this. I will never watch this again and I will never recommend this to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "My personal recommendation at the end ;)\r\n\"Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?\" - pretty interesting title, which represented by truly cute girl Ako.\r\nFor sure, I'm not watching currently airing animes, because I'm of this type who prefer to watch something without breaks, without waiting, etc.:\r\nBut I was sick and need to watch something what will calm me down after all exams I had last week. I've chosen \"Netoge\". \r\nI was enjoying it from the first episode till last I can see at the moment. The first thing which caught my attention was plot, story and idea. Of course I'm talking about \"this\"plot ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) - just kidding, or maybe not xD. Seriously - the idea and plot caucht me upand I have to say that it's pretty nice. Playing games, MMO genre, girl with a problem and the guy who has to help her. Ok. Sounds pretty normal, I know. But there is so many anime that it's truly hard to achive something truly new and innovative. The most important thing is how to show something what already was showed but different way. And that's what I like. The idea is pretty simple and everyone know what's going on, but it still keeps us wathcing.\\n\\n\r\nFor sure. I'm men, so after exams when I wanted to chill out I was looking for something little ecchi with nice \"plot\". Sure, but I'm not shallow person. Boobs etc.: are just something for us, but that what I love in some anime is just that what I can think about, some reflections, motives, morals, feels, especially feels. \\n\r\nI'm truly emotional man. \\n\\n\r\n...So what I like about this anime?\\n\r\nThat's pretty simple. I wanna say that nearly everything but nothing the most, if I can say so. There is nothing what I can say that I just dislike. \\n\\n\r\n-Plot/Story [7/10]\\n\r\nWell, It would be very hard to say something about the story without spoilers, but I won't say anything so keep reading ;)\\n\r\nThe anime show us the story of a girl Ako who can't separate online world from real life, and she felt in love with Nishimura, who she got to know in game, but for real they are people who could know each other in real life, beacuse they are studying in the same school. The other players from the guild thought about meeting in real life, and that's how the whole story has begun. What I like about the stroy, maybe it's not innovative but it's truly catchy. I really like it. Maybe that's because of charater creation someway, but I don't think so at all. The story is really rough what keep me close to it. I was pretty focused when I was watching it what is weird for me, because I mainly focus while I'm watching some slice of life anime genre, romance or drama, but not commedy with ecchi and romance elements. I was really happy after wacthing fifth episode, beacuse I began to believe that anime has the good romance potential. I was hoping it all the time, but after this episode I was truly sure of it. Ant that's what I love &lt;3 Ecchi mixed with romance is something perfect for chilling.\\n\\n\r\nDepartments:\\n\\n\r\n-Art [8/10]\\n\r\nRating of art depends on our taste, style, like, but that's review is share of my opinions right? So in my opinion the art and animation style stand on truly good level. Maybe it's not masterpiece for me, but really.. I'm truly enjoying watching it, and my eyes don't say - \"hey, you, stop watching this, it hurts.\". I truly feel good about the art in this anime. It's jsut beautiful. Tones of pastel colors, nice art style, smooth animation, beautiful created characters and world, what can I say more? Let your eyes see it, you won't be disappointed ;)\\n\\n\r\n-Music [6/10]\\n\r\nI'm music lover, so that's really hurtful for me give such a low rate, but what can I say, it doesn't depend on my, right? I can just rate that what I have hear. Unfortunately I haven't hear anything special. Of course music isn't bad but it's also not something with \"wow\" or \"cool\" effect. I think that the music is bad side of this anime. I also think that I could rate this anime 9/10 if the music would be better. In my opinion if there would be some OST which could make feeling stronger and could expose specific scenes this anime would really got 9/10 for me. I can't say anytihing more about music here, beacuse I have no words for something truly neutral. \\n\r\nSo I can say, it's not good but not bad too.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters [8/10]\\n\r\nYeah, I have to say that I truly enjoy character creation here. It's simply really good in my opinion. I'm not only talking about the desing. Of course it's really, really important, but it also depends on art style, right? I was thinking mostly about the nature of characters. Ako is charming, cute girl, which plays all the time, has no friends before she met Nishimura and the rest of the guild. She can't separate the real world from the online one, or even her in-game husband is treated like a true husband in real life. That makes her truly funny character but cute and charming at the same time. Her reactions and facial expressions are really sweet and funny in my opinion. She is probably my fav character of this anime and one of fav female characters from anime. We will se how will she change to the end of the series.\\n\r\nNishimura, young student of the same school as Ako is one of main characters, which I want to compliment. Men who was rejected online, and he promised himself to never ever confess love online, be Ako was exception &lt;3 He seems to be really good men, looking after her women. I hope he will achive his target and he will be \"true\", real life, conscious couple created with Ako. There are also few other girls what looks like a harem anime, but it's not at all. First thing what was related to true harem I saw in 7th epsiode.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment [7/10]\\n\r\nAs I said eery single time in every point, I really enjoyed watching this anime. It's truly good in my opinion. I'm guy, so to be honest, cute girls, romance, ecchi, big boobs etc.: are something what I love, so I can not say that I'm just not enjoying it. \\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 7/10\\n\r\nI wanted to give it 8, but I could not.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation!\\n\r\nWho, I can recommend it?\\n\r\nEvery person, who would like to laugh for a while, who want to calm down, see some wonderful art or jsut cute girls with big boobs &lt;3 But not only, because the plot of this show is also really good in my opinion, so if you are looking for some romance anime I want to say that I keep one's fingers crossed for this anime and the romance plot here. I hope it will be main theme at the end &lt;3 Unfortunately I didn't see what I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nLike boobs, cute girls, nice plot, some romance, interesting ideas? Check this anime :) \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for osme GIFs related to this anime, check out my giphy channel:\\n\r\nhttp://giphy.com/channel/kuhiro/\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, I hope I could help someone!\\n\r\nJa ne\\n\r\n~Kuhiro",

            "content": "Ran, ran, ran, raaaaan, Don't you jaz wanna give Ako a head slap for being such as wired as in way wired than a retard, Nya. Now that's over with, tbh I really don't have much love for this anime, and quite frankly it just the moe thing that keeps me from not dropping this.\r\nStorywise, just as what the title states, this anime or its manga really did tlive to what is expected , about a guy meeting his online wife which turned out to be a cute girl after all, well that the plot. But despite of this having a harem genre, it wasn;tmuch of anything  since there isn't any competition among the harem members for the guy's affection, in fact for the mot part one would be more focus on one character and yes its Ako, not because of what great she brings to the plot but what's disgusting about her, Nya. So despite of my annoyance to Ako and the flip flopping cyber punk/action, it was decent enough, so it's a 4 over 10 for this part....Nya.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, ok so there is still the usual school uniform moe, the almost panchira and some who has to be the one to be the \"absolute territory\" kinda thing, and I'm talking about the knee high sock thing for Akane \"Schwein\" Segawa, there is of course someone who has to be a quintessential kyonyu in Kyou \"Apricot\" Goshouin, my pet peeved was with the boys school uniform were we see Rusian wear plaid pants that is a certain fashion crime for a guy like him. But nevertheless despite of a one time Ako naked scene , Kyou \"Apricot\" Goshouin's scantly on-line game attire (where we don't get to see her nipples), it was still a fairly decent to say the least, so I'm giving this category a 6 over 10. Nya.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I'm giving it a 7 over 10 for the opening and closing theme, and that's as good as it gets. Nya.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, ok so we're suppose to focus on them alley cats , namely Rusina, Apricot, Schwein (Oink, Oink), Ako (hokikomori like her should die) and later one Sette (Gi, Gi) and Nekohime (Nya). But as much as I would love to...........I was very much locked on to Ako, in a very disgusted way. Frankly, it's all about her being detached to reality , cu'z she can't blend in , and one like me...if we can somehow would like to give that character a head slap for being such a retard, so I really don't have any second thoughts of me giving this part a 3 over 10. Nya.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Nya, I only have a decent form of enjoyment for this thing up a certain episode, so it's a 4 over 10, but..................................................\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime loses it momentum  at eps 11 and 12, the thing is that this anime puts more emphasize on the romance of Rusian and Ako  that when it got to the serious part of them Alley cats fighting them Wallenstein, my mood simply goes down as in way down lame and boring, were I'm more glad that this anime ended in such sour note that I still wanna give Ako a head slap, so as much as I hate to say it to me this anime is a pathetic 1, Nya.\\n\\n\r\nWhaohoho OUT, Nya.",

            "content": "This anime started strong. It had great comedy (imho) and even felt as though it was going to have decent character development. So why do i have a rating of 6? Allow me to explain.\r\nStarting with the story we have, essentially, another game/life otaku anime. This is not SAO or Overlord as the characters are not trapped in the game world. They are instead highschool teens that each enjoy games. One of which enjoys it to an excessive extent and has even lost touch with the difference between the game world and reality. At first the story attempts to delve into this and they forma club specifically to help said character. Sadly, this quickly devolves into an average rom/com. Don't get me wrong, i laughed quiet hard at some of the scenes but the development for \"Romance\" was nowhere to be found and it ends on an extremely overplayed/cliche note.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was above average but nothing particularly amazing since we have seen plenty with the same art/animation in these last few seasons. Not to much to note on it other than it was bright and colorful, for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also nothing to write home about. It was above average but none of the OSTs really stuck with me or gave me any sense of attachment to the characters. This could largely be blamed on the lack of character development but we will get to that next. \\n\\n\r\nThe character....this was both the best and worst part of the anime. There was little to NO development in this department. The only one that saw any advancement was our protagonist and i'm not even sure i want to call it progression in his character because it felt forced. I loved Aika in the beginning but that love slowly shriveled as her character seemed to slowly lose the drive she had originally. In the first few episodes she not only confessed, openly snuggles up to him and even states they are married (publicly) she also had a strong sense of attachment that, at times, even made her seem Yandere. She even had an extremely funny but courageous scene that showed just how strong her conviction was to have our protagonist accept her as his waifu (let me tell you i would not have shut that door). That was quickly turned over though and she very quickly became a character for comedic/fanservice purposes. Personally, i'm never one to pick at fanservice but when it literally takes over a major character that had plenty of good development room, it hurts. I literally wanted to cry towards the middle of this series of episodes because i knew how it would end and it ended in exactly that way....without any romantic development and without any character development. If anything it went backwards T_T\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i would say that this anime is decent. IF you are looking for romance go almost anywhere else. This has VERY LITTLE development in that area and quickly focuses on comedy. If you are looking for something to watch passively for a good few laughs then i would say this is pretty good.",

            "content": "Story: The plot has a good proposition about approaching the lives of people excluded from society who find in electronic games an outlet for their frustrations and together they interact to become better and better adapted human beings to the society that previously seemed extremely hostile to them. There was a great margin for the development of the characters, but this expectation did not materialize, either because of bad script choices, or because the original material was very large and this development would occur later. I think it should be the role of the director to be able to pick up elements of the story'smost advanced points in order to give a worthy conclusion to a short anime like that. So watching this anime is frustrating in many ways, with so many episodes being spent for literally no development.\\n\r\nArt: the design is OK. the choice of mouth design really annoyed me. I've never seen a mouth with only the lower lip. Really strange. The animation was not very smooth.\\n\r\nSound: very generic. \\n\r\ncharacter: probably the best item of the work is the conception of the characters. So watching Netoge becomes even more frustrating, since the development of these characters is very small. 12 episodes may not seem like much, but I've seen lots of animes doing a lot better than that with the same amount. My biggest frustration is with the development of the couple Rusian and Ako. The staff could have given an original ending in which she begins to better understand the difference between reality and games, and understands that Nishimura and Rusian are different persona, and that she wishes to be with Nishimura. This could occur in the episode where Nishimura has his character hacked, and Ako starts to question herself what would it be of her relationship with Nishimura, now that Rusian is gone. But the director missed the opportunity to do an original development starting from that point. A satisfying ending would be Ako and Nishimura beginning to date like real people in the real world, with a kiss to give it a good ending. But the element of romance seems to have been cast aside in terms of the development of the plot, and has become only a comic element for the show. And this was unforgivable. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: At the beginning I enjoyed it. From episode 8 onwards it was just disappointment and frustration. The staff has chosen as a climax point a in game event, vaguely related to a real life event, that is the cultural festival. The climax point should be a real life event. It would give much more meaning to it. \\n\r\nOverall I don't recommend this anime to anyone, unless it is a person desperate for a anime to watch, and have watched every anime I have watched that i think it's better than this one. This is a classic exemple of anime that it would be better if it had not followed the original material (LN)",

            "content": "There's nothing inherently *wrong* with [Excessively Long Anime Title Anime]. If you're into game-type series with a lot of physics-defying high school grills then I expect you'll get value from the twelve episodes. So, worth watching? Not really. It was never bad enough for me to drop it, but the last three episodes had me watching on half the screen while researching grilling tips for my Grillmaster\u2122 5000\u2122 and sorting my extensive collection of Grill\u2122 Images\u2122 on the other.\r\nIt's not really a harem anime because there's only one grill in the running, but the other collection of QTs stick around the boring protagonist like gumon the bottom of a school desk put there by some random Stacy while she blew Chad Penninghampgoldworthton and then forgotten about just like her prescription for Zovirax. There's nothing special about any of the main or side characters, although that doesn't mean they lack charm or personality. It's obviously nothing you haven't seen before, but they're still fun to watch. Also, the animation is top-quality and some of the panoramas really are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really salts my dripping axe wound is the premise/co-main component of [ELATA]: the video game Legendary Age. At first I somewhat enjoyed the game world because it allowed an alternate storytelling path for the characters to grow--even though I really, super-duper don't like vidya animes. Then it just kept going to the point where the last couple episodes are all about the game. This sucks because by that point in the series I didn't give a dry turd about the game, I wanted to watch the characters interact IRL. I'd \"gotten to know them\" and wanted that to take priority over an endless stream of MMO cliches. And speaking of, some of the memes spouted in dialogue are overused (normie scum) bordering on cringey.\\n\\n\r\nBut like I said before, there's nothing *bad* here, but it's definitely not good either. I didn't hate my time because I did finish it, but I also can't really recommend it either unless you're really into the vidya anime \"genre.\"",

            "content": "tl;dr: An MMO focused romcom that is quite original despite being yet another MMO anime due to being more grounded, realistic, and focused.\r\nThis anime had a good amount more depth than I expected in a lot of areas. First off, rather than the game being based on anything too\u00a0extravagant, it's based on a simple sprite based MMO, but that actually worked really well.\u00a0It went into issues with MMOs that are more realistic than the\u00a0large-scale futuristic stories you find in most VRMMO anime, such as dealing with protecting your password and dealing with admins, so that was surprisingly interesting. Thought the way the anime was portrayed,with things happening in the game being portrayed as if they were real life, felt kind off as a lot of things simply don't make sense as being possible in that format. They should have at least done a 3D game with voice chat instead of sprites with text boxes I think, though I do understand that that would require changes to some plot lines. What was just as if not more interesting as the MMO aspect, was\u00a0Rusian\u00a0and Ako's relationship. It was interesting in that it wasn't based on developing a relationship exactly, in that they're already married in a way, but rather moving their relationship from the game world to reality. Hence, it was centered more around them having different understands of what they're relationship was and synchronizing that, rather than\u00a0than\u00a0love itself blooming between them, because it's essentially maxed out from the beginning. Hence, the relationship and character development that occurs is Ako coming to accept that the real world is different from the game world, but isn't completely pointless and worth living in, but also\u00a0Rusian\u00a0coming to accept that real life and games aren't completely separate and that things to a certain extent things like relationships certainly do\u00a0carry over.\u00a0So\u00a0they're moving towards a center from two opposite sides. Now, this development is ultimately really small, baby steps really, but its fleshed out and was really enjoyable to watch happening. Furthermore, Ako's character is really adorable, with her voice\u00a0acor\u00a0being really good and fitting, and her chemistry with Nishimura is amazing, so they're just an incredibly enjoyable couple to watch in general. Akane and\u00a0Kyou\u00a0had\u00a0potential but\u00a0felt like\u00a0they were in serious need of being fleshed out more, as they were rarely if ever the focus at all. The comedy and the\u00a0laid-back,\u00a0light-hearted mood\u00a0were\u00a0also really appreciated.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were solid. The character designs were pretty great. The OP/ED were also really good, and the show made good use of rolling the ED while things were still happening on screen. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable outside of the use of the instrumental versions of the OP/ED.\u00a0",

            "content": "My advice for Netoge? Judge it by the cover.\r\nDon't expect to pick up this series and receive a well thought out plot, characters with insane depth, or any really heartfelt romance. It's the type of anime that can easily parade itself around as if it has all of that, but it only has all of it in certain moderation. If you watch Netoge, you shouldn't be expecting something that would be able to claim a place as a keystone anime, but something that, as long as you appreciate the genres, will not be 'bad'.\r\nBefore you read any type of summary or reviews, you'll probably buildsome interest by the images you see. There's no shame in that, because the art for this anime is beautiful. The colors are bright and happy, the lighting they use in various scenes is done very well, and overall it's just so smooth. Cardboard-Cutout-MC-kun is one thing, but the girls are so cute, you really have to try hard to not want to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of cute girls, Ako is absolutely adorabley cringey, Master is the lady neckbeard we all want to see, and Segawa is our tsun (-dere is being looked into). Master, or Kyou if you must have a different name, is great. The 'premium gamer' everyone wants to be, but everyone hates to see. She pulls it off in a fashion that doesn't get annoying, but still plays the 'rich kid' trope that's needed for harems. On the other hand, we have Segawa, filling the spot for the classmate and tsundere. Fortunately, this isn't an anime that really gives a love triangle, or square, or really anything you'd expect from the usual harem. Segawa doesn't ever give off the appearance of having a legitimate affection for Nishimura and honestly, it's the one thing I couldn't have hoped for more.  She gives off her tsundere tones, but is able to play nice, and doesn't interfere with the romance we were given.\\n\\n\r\nNow, turning attention to the two that are most important, Nishimura and Ako. Ako is great in a lot of senses of the word. She's cute, both in looks and the way she acts, she's cringey, but adorable at the same time. The problem with her is that she doesn't have friends and spends so much time in her room, but it's shown so much that its to no fault of anybody but herself. She's awkward, quiet, and basically tries her hardest to not be involved with anyone at school. Seeing a little of that mentality shaved away over the course of the season was great, but there was a lack of enjoyment for me seeing this gorgeous girl so against 'normies'. As for Nishimura, his reactions weren't the greatest. He'd react to Ako's affection, react to any typical anime mishaps, but all of his reactions were just kind of sub-par. I hoped for a little more, but he was ultimately pretty dull throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes, I pretty much gave my opinion on it at the start of the review. If you want a romance, harem, or otherwise, there are better options for the genre you want found elsewhere. Netoge does all of the things it says it does, but on a lesser scale. However, while that sounds bad, it leaves a lot of room for the characters to just kind of be themselves. The interactions you get from them just sitting in a room together are enjoyable because rather than being a setup for something bigger, it's just idle banter.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend it if you want something nice to watch, but again, I do feel that if you're on mission to watch a specific genre, there are better options. Don't expect too much from a series that is wholeheartedly just enjoyable.",

            "content": "I love video games! I am a huge gamer and I totally love playing video games. You can clearly say from my user name that I am a gamer. So I have to like this anime right? WRONG! This anime was disappointing and I could not stand it at all! (Note: This is a first impression, because I just could not watch the whole series for how boring it was, but you can go and read other reviews if you want a proper one.)\r\nFor this review I will be focusing on story, Art style, characters and my overall enjoyment.\r\nStory: The story of this entire showis absolutely ridiculous. A bunch of gamers that play an mmorpg together and for some reason one of the girl can't distinguish between the gaming and real world. Honestly there are thousands of anime about mmorpg, so this one is not anything new. I mean seriously, it will take more than four weeks for me to count how many there are. Basically this anime is a remake of a million other anime and they tried to put their own little twist in it because otherwise it will be copyright. In conclusion the story isn't anything unique, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is my favorite, the main reason I got into anime is mainly because of it's art. A lot of people might disagree with me, but hey everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The art for \"Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?\"\\n\r\nfeels refreshing to see, the colors are great and the characters look super cute. Although this type of art isn't anything new, I still like it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are the tropes that you would find in your average harem anime. You have the tsundere, the shy girl who is also some what of a yandere. You can find all those tropes in here. The protagonist also doesn't play any super big role either. I wouldn't remember any of these characters because they are all technically a bunch of other characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did not enjoy this at all, I was bored to death! This show is VERY disappointing and boring, they don't have too much to show off but harem girls in cute clothing that just so happen to be gamers.",

Also there was this hilarious yandere element which I've never seen in a comedy anime before this and i was totally anticipating Ako Tamaki to start killing people which added a great element of tension which was resolved as they developed her character further. Also for being an ecchi anime themain male protagonist wasn't an obnoxious pervert nor was it focused on being overly pandering. it was just over all well balanced.\\n\\n\r\nTo rate it: the story was average, the art was nice, the sound was decent, the characters were well done and it was over all really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched several romantic comedies that were total garbage being neither funny nor even developing the romance and this anime delivered on its promises. Its not an exquisite story but it was entertaining. This was a light hearted ecchi romantic comedy game anime and while there are a plethora of this genre this was a good example of how to do comedy right and i was giggling all the way through. Could have gone for more diversity in the bust size department as they only offered extra large and extra small but honestly this anime was pretty great. Also Akane Segawa / Schwein is my waifu!",

short, I was not disappointed with that one.\r\nThe synopsis sounds simple: Teenager confesses ingame to his beloved cat-girl-character, but she refuses him because she is actually an older \"he\".\r\nHow could he have seen THAT coming...?\r\nNow he strictly separates online from offline, and the series starts with our MC being part of the guild \"Alley cats\", consisting of 4 players.\r\nDid not sound like a probably awful SAO clone, but like some fun and playing with MMORPGtropes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story offers no great surprises and dramatic plot twists, you can guess the outline of the plot quite well just by looking at the title pic, perhaps with one little exception.\\n\r\nBut nevertheless, it is still fun to watch.\\n\r\nAlthough there are many girls involved, it is not a harem show, and I think that fits quite well for NetoYome.\\n\r\nThe romance part does not feature deep crisis and other dramatic events that are often found in romance series, but instead shows the transition of a relationship from online to offline, with both characters being far from normal, and their transition.\\n\r\nAs for the comedy part, it made me laugh a lot, it featured a lot of different tropes, often presented in an unusual way.\\n\\n\r\nArt is well done and enjoyable, except some minor CGI parts.\\n\r\nGame graphics is presented in 2 ways, rather simple, blocky and pixel-ish when shown on a monitor, and realistic, often switching back and forth.\\n\r\nThere are lots of panty and boob shots, and the mandatory beach and bathing scenes are present as well.\\n\r\nCensorship is minimal, some strands of hair or a little foam over the most important parts, but no annoying beams of light or massive amounts of vapor over half of the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound was decent and enjoyable, VA fitted quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are put together from different tropes mostly, but in a funny and somewhat believable way, not just annoying standard.\\n\r\nThey all have some kind of development, not forced but feeling quite natural.\\n\r\nDetails in the spoiler section below.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, I liked NetoYome a lot, grinned and laughed a lot.\\n\r\nThe humour, self-awareness, irony, tropes abuse and uniqueness is what makes a comedy show stick in my head for longer.\\n\r\nBoobs and ecchi stuff are fine, I don't deny that, but if that is all a show has to offer, I will forget about it quite soon.\\n\r\nBut there were also some things that made me think a little, like the hikikomori hints (see below).\\n\\n\r\n*** The following section contains spoilers! ***\\n\r\n*** If you do not want to be spoilered, please stop here. ***\\n\\n\r\nThe male lead is Hideki or \"Rusian\" (I think this is some misspelled form of \"Lucien\", \"Lucian\" or some sort of it, at least it often sounds like that).\\n\r\nBecause he confessed online to a girl character who turned out to be a man, he strictly separates ingame and offline.\\n\r\nNow he is finally married ingame with the female character Ako, after she confessed to him multiple times.\\n\r\nThey have chatted a lot, and he likes her character very much.\\n\r\nBut he doesn't care who/what that character is offline, at least at first, the only important thing to him is that she is a cute character, as some kind of self-protection.\\n\r\nHe is a gamer and kind of an otaku, but still has some offline friends.\\n\r\nWhen they all meet, Ako treats him as his husband because of their online marriage, but for him, they are two different persons.\\n\r\nIt takes him some time to realize that Ako is Ako, be it online or offline, and to overcome his rejection from earlier.\\n\\n\r\nAko, the female lead, is a very reclusive girl with no offline social skills, she often skips class and has built up a wall around herself, but she seems satisfied with that.\\n\r\nAt her first appearance in the show, she collided with Hideki, hung her head and ran away.\\n\r\nOnline, she is also clumsy and stuff, but Rusian was always kind to her, and supported her, so she began to like and even love him.\\n\r\nFor her, online is somehow more real than offline, and she does not separate both at all.\\n\r\nShe is married with Rusian online, so when they meet offline, she calls him and sees in him her husband, which leads to obvious problems.\\n\r\nShe loves Rusian, be it online or offline, that is no difference for her, no matter how desperate her friends from the guild want to explain that difference to her.\\n\r\nHideki confesses to Ako multiple times, but she always refuses him.\\n\r\nNot because she doesn't like him, but because they are already married from her point of view, so that would be a downgrade of their relationship.\\n\r\nDuring the show, she grows in self-confidence, a small step for a normal person, but a giant leap for her.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is a classmate of Hideki, she seems absolutely normal and does not want to have anything to do with otaku or gaming culture.\\n\r\nShe acts like a typical tsundere, although Hideki comments he misses the dere part.\\n\r\nAs we get to know soon, she is a secret gamer, and is a member of the same guild as Rusian, although she plays a male character named Schwein (which is German for pig, and she doesn't know that meaning, it just sounded cool for her).\\n\r\nWhen the guild has its first offline meeting, she is shocked that anyone could find out about her playing online games, and that her days as a normal student could be over.\\n\r\nAt first, she acts as if she didn't know Hideki or Ako, but Ako doesn't care about that and even calls her by her online name.\\n\r\nLater on, she opens up to the others offline as well, and kind of overcomes her fear from being seen as not normal.\\n\r\nHer online character changes from male to female after is was revealed that she is a girl, at the first occasions only some short flashes, but then permanently.\\n\r\nWe get some quite subtle hints that she might have feelings for Hideki, but she never makes direct any moves towards him, only the way she acts sometimes and a Freudian slip.\\n\\n\r\nKyou is the student council president.\\n\r\nHer parents are very wealthy, but she doesn't brag with it, they own just some companies and schools (one of them being the school they all attend) and stuff, it is just normal for her.\\n\r\nShe had never had any friends, maybe because of her family's wealth and her kind of untouchable aura, but she was never happy with that.\\n\r\nAs it turns out, she is the leader of the guild, and she also plays a male character, which changes to female later on.\\n\r\nBecause of her wealth, she owns tons of expensive special game items, and doesn't care at all how much they cost.\\n\r\nAfter the offline meeting, she got real friends for the first time in her life, which makes her complete domestic staff cry for joy when she invites them to her home.\\n\r\nShe even installs a computer game club at their school, so she along with her new friends and guild members have a club to go, and to teach Ako the difference between online and offline.\\n\r\nFor her, we also get some very subtle hints that she might have feelings for Hideki, when she asks him to call her by her first name, she completely blushes, and when she slightly blushes whe she wants to oil up Hideki with suntan, but she doesn't make the slightest move either.\\n\\n\r\nMs. Saitou, a young teacher at their school, is a strict but very caring person who understands her students very well.\\n\r\nShe is happy that Ako has made some friends, and is concerned when she skips class to lock herself in.\\n\r\nLater in the show, it is revealed that it was in fact her, to whom Hideki once made his confession, she just couldn't tell him that she was a teacher, and she didn't know that she was his teacher.\\n\r\nHer online character is cat-like with ears and a tail, she often ends her sentences with nya (meow) and exposes a very childish behaviour, just like a teenager.\\n\\n\r\nBefore the guild meets offline for the first time, Hideki thinks his guild consists of 3 males and a female or perhaps just 4 males, but now he is suddenly surrounded with 3 pretty girls from his very school instead, one of them claiming to be his wife.\\n\r\nReality flipped upside down, who would have seen THAT coming?\\n\r\nOk, you could have guessed it from the title pic, just like I did, killjoy...\\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, we get an interesting view of how an individual becomes a NEET hikikomori.\\n\r\nAko is socially (self-)isolated, fears the offline world and immediately runs away from any danger or uncomfortable situation.\\n\r\nShe skips class and is well prepared to lock herself into her room for a week at any time, she even has a refrigerator in her room.\\n\r\nShe even thinks of dropping school completely, to have more time for her online game, where she feels safe and comfortable.\\n\r\nAlthough presented in a comedy manner, it made me at least think a little...\\n\\n\r\nComedic highlights: When Hideki comes to Ako's home trying to convince her to continue school, he unlocks the door and sees her in her underwear halfway on.\\n\r\nHe is embarrassed, immediately closes the door and tells her to get herself ready, but when he opens it again, she sits there completely naked and asks him to be gentle...\\n\r\nI like it when tropes are mashed up!\\n\\n\r\nYou can't have an ecchi show without the mandatory bikini presentation and suntan-rubbing scene, but this one here is different.\\n\r\nWhen Akane and Kyou arrive at the beach, they are disappointed that Ako is already there, because they wanted to show their bikinis at the same time to Hideki, to get him a nose bleed.\\n\r\nAfter that, he gets oiled up by all three girls simultaneously, and feels quite abused.\\n\\n\r\nOr the typical bathing intruder scene: Hideki is sitting alone in the men's bath, when suddenly the door opens, and he jumps up. \\n\r\nAko, wrapped in a towel, wants to bathe with him, and now sees him standing in the basin, completely naked.\\n\r\nWhen she is pulled away by her friend, she refuses loudly and wants to stay.\\n\r\nDid I already say that I like it, when typical tropes are put through the grinder and flipped completely upside down?",

            "content": "*This is my first review so it may be bad, sorry. Also, apologies for any spelling/grammar mistakes*\r\nNetoge is one of those shows where it can be tough to get through an episode, it's repetitive, slightly obnoxious, and sometimes boring.\r\nStory (5):\r\nI gave the story a five since it can be pretty unclear at times, the genre is comedy, NOT romance. A romance anime usually revolves around a couple and their development (although, obviously, there are some exceptions). This anime tries to be romance but overall fails. It's about Rusian and Ako's 'relationship' and also the rest of the club trying to get Ako to realize thedifference between the real and fictional world. Even though there are only 12 episodes, the story seems to me like it gets so dragged out, Ako's character just becomes annoying and ridiculous. At the time of me writing this review (10 episodes seen), she just annoys me and I honestly don't think the story will have a complete and good conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nThe art in this show is actually very enjoyable. I really like bright and colorful anime and it really goes with the feeling of the show. At times, the fanservice can be ridiculous *cough* the sun lotion scene, but at times the fanservice can be suttle (kind of...). There's not much to say about the art, it goes well with the show but it isn't anything too special.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nThe sound in this show is above average. The opening can get tiring after a few episodes and in my opinion, I even found it annoying. Then again, there we're times I would find myself humming it or getting it stuck in my head. The background music is kind of generic and the sound effects are pretty good, again, there's nothing too special about the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3):\\n\r\nOh boy, this was the part I was excited to write about, I just love bashing on horrible things.\\n\\n\r\nRusian is pretty bland. He is a good main character that most can relate to, he plays a video game and meets a girl who was actually a 'boy' and falls in love with her, she then admits that she is actually a 'boy' in real life, making Rusian 'heartbroken'. His flaws are that he has a delusional wife, he meets her in real life and actually falls for her. That's about all I can think of, he's a pretty average person in game and in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAko is, hands down, the WORST character in this show. At first, I thought she was pretty cute albeit a little annoying. As the show progressed, it became apparent that she couldn't differentiate the real world and the game world, she just thought life was one big game, or they were the same thing. The rest of the club tries to help her realize that they are two separate things, but she flat out doesn't listen. At first, I thought that was a pretty good flaw, but towards the end of the anime, she showed no signs of improvement. As you probably noticed, it gets very annoying and repetitive. Rusian wants them to be a thing, but Ako just won't listen because she thinks they're married. Onto some good things about Ako, there are very little. At times, she can be funny, but she's really just whiny, possessive, and childish.\\n\\n\r\nAkane is a girl for all the loli fans out there. She is stuck up, but also 'cute' her character is overall, okay. She is bratty and doesn't want to be seen around any of the other club members in school. She does have a caring side for them though, and considers them very close friends of hers. To sum her character up in one word, tsundere, that's pretty much all she is. Sometimes she can be pretty goofy though, those moments kind of save her character.\\n\\n\r\nKyoh is the calm and collected character, she is usually the one in charge and keeps everyone from slacking off. Like Akane, she is pretty okay overall, she also has her silly moments as well. Sadly, her character is mostly just there for fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nNanako is very annoying, she comes in later in the show and is also just for fanservice. She is rarely with the rest of the club and has just a very annoying personality, she's also very bland and just follows Akane around like a lost dog.\\n\\n\r\nYui is the teacher and also the club supervisor. She's not really annoying like most of the cast, but she can be pretty bland. She is basically just the glue that holds the club together, they need a teacher in order to have the club and that's her, she also has a pretty useless character in game. Whenever the rest of the cast needs help though, she usually steps in with her \"Neko-hime protection squad\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5):\\n\r\nWhen I first started this anime I enjoyed it, towards the end it just annoyed me. Some of the jokes are really funny and relatable to people with basic gaming knowledge, other times, they can be pretty bad and cringy. Ako was the big problem with me, but the story and events in the episodes just became obnoxious and hard to watch at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(5):\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this anime to someone who's looking for a romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nI might recommend this to someone who is looking for a fanservicey anime.\\n\\n\r\nI might recommend this to someone looking for a gaming anime.",

Nothing crazy or orginial but i really enjoyed it. It has a lot of funny moments in it and a lot of dudes love hot gamer girls(I know I do). The cast is your standard cast. There's the harem captain aka lead male Nishimura. He's a hardcore gamer who is considerate and kind and has the most common sense. He has problems with male gamers using female characters. Then there's themain girl Tamaki. She's a delusional gamer girl who escapes from reality and falls for Nishimura in the game. She's a busty airhead and has no common sense at all. She is adorable though. It's like a busty girl with a little girl mind. Speak slowly and make sure to relate everything to a game like ''man that final exam was a high level boss''.  And she might be borderline perverted towards Nishimura. Now the side cast, Segawa and Goshouin. Segawa is a twin tailed blond loli tsundere. Yeah I know. Theres millions of chracters like her. Lol. She acts like she hates Otaku but she's a big one. She just wants to fit in and be a ''normal'' girl. Please they're boring, those normies. Be you Segawa-chan, i dont judge. Lastly Goshouin. She's a rich busty student council president. She screams ''out of your league'' but she's nerdy. She can out class you that way too. With her 10 monitor freakin top line gaming setup. Us mere peasants fall short. I aint worried though, im a short haired loli lovin man myself. Lol. Thats all.",

I feel the same while watching this mess of a show.You could also compare it with a cringe compilation.So, what even happens in this wish-fullfillment fantasy?\r\nDont let yourself be fooled by the description on MAL, the element that MC proposed to some girl on the internet before is thrown out of the window in one ofthe earlier episodes to fit in more ridiculous \"video-game talk\".Its basically just a really uninteresting and needlessly stretched romance, and like digibro said in his review for this \"There is no reason why they should not fuck immediately\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is bright and flashy.I have no clue about anime art , but im just gonna say that it was the only reason why i didn't try to pour something really hot into my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is completely bland and i cant remember any melody, except for the opening because it is so painfull.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are either full-on trope embodiments or go halfway through with the stereotypes.I dont know which is worse to be honest , but the main girl is kind-of a yandere, so if thats your cup of tea you might want to...no.Dont.Watch Mirai Nikki instead, at least they tried there.(I have not watched Mirai Nikki but im a hundred percent sure its better than this)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half of the show because of the reason mentioned earlier: its like watching very stupid people do very stupid things and laughing at them.The characters behave so unnaturally stupid and clichee-like, its hard not to laugh.After a short time it became just boring , so maybe give it a try when you are drunk or on other substances.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for any spelling mistakes, its 1 AM and im bored and annoyed at the same time, because this show gets 10-point reviews.Ew!\\n",

            "content": "Look, before I say it, this anime is never going to win awards for being innovative or epic like other animes, but it has something about it that makes it feel special. However, I feel like they didn't capture that essence of the anime enough and that's why I can't rate it an 8 like I so wanted to.\r\nThe Story:\r\nSo, get this. The story is about a group of highschoolers playing video games. No, not getting trapped inside video games or being transported to a fantasy world that has the rules of an RPG. They are sitting around, playing video games. There is more tothe story than this, but let me just say how refreshing it was to watch character who actually enjoyed playing the game itself and their interactions with the game and other people in the game instead of some life or death scenario while being trapped in a video game or something (shots fired ;))\\n\\n\r\nNow, I did say their is more to the story than just what I said before. One of the characters, Ako, turns out to have the distinct inability to distinguish her roleplaying character from herself, and thus she fails to separate the real world and video game. It is the job for the other characters to help her understand this difference. They do this through making a club at their school (yes, all he members of their guild happen to be at the school it's plot convenience roll with it).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOkay, sure it's not the most amazing art out there, but IMO it in't completely trash. The art style has such a playful style to it that was pleasant to watch. It was a very cute style, it works, and they change in style from the real world to the game world was great. I feel like this is a good place to mention it, but I do appreciate that they show each person's in game character in universe rather than just their images on a screen, although it might give some people the wrong idea.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing unique, but it had an OST that very well complimented the anime's lighthearted feel but also accentuates the dramatic moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI'm glad that they characters aren't generic harem archetypes like they appeared to be at the very start of the show. Instead, we get video game archetypes, which I am perfectly okay with. Nishimura and Akane are both casual players who know enough about the game to get by, although Akane does roleplay \"her bad self\". Master (I can't remember her real name) is a premium player, and it's beautiful to see that even it anime, everyone hates premium players. Sette (real name forgotten) is the complete newbie who doesn't quite get how the game works. And then we have Ako, who I've mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show really does is show the slow real life friendship of Akane and Nishimura, given that Akane was the \"closet Otaku\" who played but never admitted it while Nishimura was open about it. Watching the two of them become friends, and I MEAN FRIENDS, not harem material, was great. The other was Ako's slow development in understanding the rules of real life that differentiate from the game's world, and you can see it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for what i enjoyed about the anime. I've mentioned before that the fact that it was an SoL about the group playing games. The other thing are those moments when they ave humor that pokes fun at other ecchi tropes, specifically the beach episode trope and the undressed girl behind a door things, both of which they play up and then make the BEST jokes out of. Honestly, the second arc is hte best for me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there did become a point, specifically in the 3rd arc before it got to more of a climax where they seemed to be focusing randomly on the busts of the female characters (except Akane, cause she's flat and you can't have that in a fanservice shot). This started to irk me because they seemed ot just randomly ramp it up as if the second arc hadn't gone about poking fun at other tropes.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this series isn't for everyone. I don't personally know who I'd recommend it to and I've seen so many people get triggered by the amount they cringed at the show, which is understandable because there are some dumb moments. However, I personally enjoyed it despite its stupidity, and I'm sure there are other people out there would would feel the same.",

            "content": "Gather round, scrubs. It's another anime about video games.\r\nNormally when you get a video game anime, it's handled pretty poorly, just look at Sword Art Online. Unfortunately, the same applies here. This show's main flaw is that it tries to achieve too little, effectively being a standard highschool rom-com. Which is a shame, because it seems to understand its audience pretty well and the inner workings of a video game. It's sad to see that such knowledge not to its full potential.\r\nNow that that's out of the way, i'll just sum up the rest of this quickly.\r\nStory- 5/10: \r\nCut/paste occasionally lewd high school romance withlittle to no closure at the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 7/10:\\n\r\nThe art can be pretty nice, out of everything, the thing that stands out most is the commercial cut stills which is a photography still with Ako placed somewhere. As for the rest of it, it's decent quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6/10:\\n\r\nNothing notable or memorable.It mainly just served it's purpose without being stand-out. Voice acting is about all I can compliment\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 6/10:\\n\r\nThe characters are not very unique and you've definitely seen them in some shape or form in other shows. Some might say Ako, but if we're being honest, she's just gonna be a Doujin printing machine for the coming months like Hotaru from Dagashi Kashi. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, unless you have broad taste in anime and also enjoy video games, I can't recommend this show. You'd be better off watching something else.",

The story lacked any sort of depth, the jokes fell completely flat and the art style varied in quality.

Especially the last few minutes were a complete joke, pissed me off and made me lower the score even more. \r\nI wanted to keep watching to see where theshow was going, some parts were a bit more serious but then they just went on to the next 'funny' scene ruining the atmosphere.",

LA's favourite character is the \"waifu\" of this anime being Ako Tamaki voiced by Rina Hidaka and her pseudo-yandere/shy tendencies warmed up to LA quite quickly, sure there are some quirky other main cast members, such as the \"Schwien\" tsundere Akane Segawa voiced by Inori Minase and the premium item buying president of the student council and the guild master of the main cast Kyou Goshouin voiced by M.A.O. What the best character development actually goes to is Ako and the main protagonist' Hideki \"Rusian\" Nishimura's relationship in both reality and in the game and greatly helped making this anime what it was, what's better is that Rusian ISN'T a dense main male protagonist and that is rather refreshing, what's rather weird and unique is Ako's take on her \"gaming and real\" relationship to Rusian and sure there are some melodrama here and there from both of them but we get to see their relationship develop (as well as a detriment) throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMany of the meta narrative takes place with the MMO the cast plays and the \"gameplay elements\" makes some of the plot the others is through atypical harem tropes (just to make sure, this anime isn't quite a harem anime, it's a pseudo one, Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? is more of a romance anime with a gaming tag and a psuedo-harem element to it), anyways Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? reminds LA playing LA's first MMO and some of the trials and tribulations LA got into talking to the society of the MMO LA played (If you really want to know, it was Elsword, sure it's the not the same classic MMO game but LA gained knowledge about MMO terms from Elsword, sue LA that it isn't similar to Netoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta?'s Legendary Age...LA...huh...no comment).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Project No.9, yes this anime has lots of \"animation facial derps\" here and again, but Project No.9 had a certain charm to it mainly through the MMO animation elements to it and because of that the animation was actually decent enough LA could give some grace to the animation derps here and there, character design wise, they have distinct appearances and a sort of bloom to them which only brings out the main cast's personalities even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, LA just thinks that Rina Hidaka who voices the main heroine, Ako Tamaki had a blast in voicing her, the other voice actors also had something like this too, but seriously it felt like that Rina Hidaka had so much fun voicing Ako.\\n\\n\r\nEnding-wise, they made something mundane made awesome in some respects and does give Ako a bit more of a personality accepting some of school life using MMO to do so. Romantic-wise, -sigh- sooo close...soo close. Overall, the ending was decent enough for LA to give the \"romance\" side some grace.\\n\\n\r\nNetoge no Yome wa Onnanoko ja Nai to Omotta? is by far for LA was a surprise of Spring 2016, it's not only from it's meta-narrative to it's characters but the certain charm of being somewhat relatable to LA's MMO gamer side and one eccentric pseudo-yandere.",

            "content": "There's a common misconception/joke in the gaming community, which goes by the fact that \"Girl gamers do not exist.\"  And while yes, the idea of girl gamers is a goddamn myth, anime brings us the unique perspective on what life would be like if there were girl gamers.  And so we are presented Netoge, a show all about one boy's shock to finding out that they indeed exist, and the dangers of crippling gaming addiction. \r\nStory: Nishimura Hideki is your average everyday gaming otaku who spends a lot of time playing the show's MMORPG known as 'Legendary Age'.  After getting his heartbroken after finding out that his previous in-game love interest was actually a guy playing a female character (cause that TOTALLY doesn't happen IRL), he swears to himself that he would never again fall in love with another in-game character ever again.  Fast forward two years, and he's married to someone in-game (great dedication there, buddy).  Even more so, he finds out that his in-game wife, Ako, is actually a person from his school, and is actually a real girl!  Not only that, but he also finds out that Ako has a crippling problem of discerning reality with the in-game world, as she constantly refers to him as 'her husband' and calls him by his avatar's name despite the two of them not...really knowing each other all that well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of Netoge is mostly about trying to get Ako to reenter back into reality through various means.  Either by trying to show her how good the real world is, have her do some things without a computer, or just socialize with people her age, the main plotline follows Hideki, or Rusian (since hell, that's what everyone in the show calls him) and the rest of the members in their small guild try and condition Ako back to being a normal girl rather than being the somewhat incompetent healer that she plays in-game.  All the while we follow the actual real-life romance of a boy trying to cope with a girl that he most likely will be taking care of and marrying for the rest of his life in the future.  In addition, with its main draw on online game, most predominantly MMORPGs, Netoge also capsulizes on different tricks and situations within a game of that genre by spending a good chunk of its runtime doing things in-game, visualizing situations, and showing the characters actually playing the game that the show is wrapped around to give us a bit more than doing an intervention for a 17 year old girl.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plus for the series comes in its usage of ecchi.  Now, not saying that fanservice is good, but the amount and the way that Netoge does it is certainly much more tasteful and enjoyable than just plastering boobs on a screen.  Most of it is done in a more comical sense and doesn't use your generic 'dude landing on the girl's boobs' or 'walk in on the girl naked' so as a result, I don't find the ecchi all the jarring or takes away from the series in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show however does have one fatal flaw with it, and that comes in the way of its actual focus on plot.  Towards the middle of the series, the show shifts to focus more on other aspects on the series rather than its core focus on trying to reintroduce Ako back into society.  As such, the series loses its way a bit and diverges down the different path of focusing solely on game-related content to the point that I myself even forgot about on what the point of the series was until the very end and then I remembered 'Oh right, this show was about helping a girl with her addiction.'\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, Netoge showed itself to be a very peculiar show that wasn't as gritty or deep as other shows are when it comes to dealing with hikkiomori-like characters (Like NHK) and provided a light-hearted and happier example all the while showing its audience other parts of its story, such as its romance, which while it didn't particularly go anywhere special (because thanks for that troll ending, Netoge), was still rather cute to go through and watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Lighthearted story that delved into hikkomori lifestyles\\n\r\n+ Other plot aspects aside from the main story\\n\r\n+/-  Some ecchi (if you're not a fan of ecchi, any ecchi, tread carefully)\\n\r\n-  Other aspects invaded and took over the show in the latter half\\n\r\n-  Bit of a troll ending \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As expected with a show involving hardcore gamers, the characters of the show are all members of an extremely small guild of four members where each of them pertain to a certain role in a battle party.\\n\\n\r\nFirst there's Nishimura Hideki, or Rusian, the main protagonist of our story.  Rusian is a boy that embraces his in-game life and his experiences online yet doesn't entirely reject the idea of real life.  Rusian as a character doesn't really stand out in the way of an interesting character.  He likes playing net games, sure, but he doesn't have any particular interesting character traits aside from masterfully being able to manage Ako and have an iron will of patience when dealing with her and her lovesick demeanor.  That being said, he does grow in the series and devotes his screentime to helping his guild as the party's tank, as well as helping his in-game wife, being not a lowly pervert or overpowered protagonist, but just your average gamer who doesn't spend money on a game who just wants to have fun.  \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the real reason why the series exists, Tamaki Ako, Rusian's wife in-game, and potential wife IRL.  (Cause there is no reason given how the series was going that these two were not going to get together.)  As mentioned before, Ako confuses the idea of reality and game to the point that to her, the two are basically the same thing, hence why she's confused over why her friends and her 'husband' make such distinctions.  Similar to Rusian, she doesn't really have many characteristics beyond being addicted to online games and has her heart set on being a housewife.  She does grow as the series goes along as well, which does give the series a sense of progress, albeit not as big due to the changes from beginning to end not being quite severe.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the two remaining members of the guild, Akane and Kyou, or the fighter and the mage of the group.  These two characters play the normal person trying to hide her online gaming tendencies and the whale who spends money for cash items in-game.  These two characters play more as a supporting characters in the main cast, as their role in the series is to aid our main couple more than anything else.  Like their other guild members, they don't particularly have many interesting traits about them due to the characters pretty much being one-note and the plot is largely story-based, but they do have more merit to them than the actual supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is largely filled with mooks and other really unimportant or one-off characters that only appear once or twice in the series.  Aside from Nekohime and Akane's friend (whose name escapes me), everyone else is pretty much nonexistent in terms of actual character importance.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Character growth\\n\r\n+ Focused character importance\\n\r\n-  Most characters are one-note\\n\r\n-  Side cast is essentially worthless and/or non-existent\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Project No.9, the studio who created...Saikin no Imouto and...Kouya...(I think I threw up in my mouth a bit), the art for Netoge is a very light, almost shiny color scheme that radiates brightness and relates back to the happy and lightheartedness that is the series's tone.  As such, the colors of the show are almost muted with white and shine and are very high light in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs of the show are moe.  Not even gonna sugarcoat it, the look of all of these characters are just straight up cute girl designs.  The quality of animation for them is very consistent despite No.9 being a company that hasn't had much of a track record but due to the very common cute girl trope that the show goes for a lot of the time, this aspect of the show may drive some people away.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the show does have ecchi.  And very clearly due to the fact that the majority of the female cast each have quite a sizable bosom.  There is one character design that just screams 'female armor' but aside from that, the actual fanservicey scenes are few and far between, and are never just blatant boobs on the screen all the time.  Maybe a few movements here and there when the girls are doing some dramatic action, but that's about it in terms of consistent fanservice in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good, consistent animation\\n\r\n+/- Fanservice (Though not as much as you may think)\\n\r\n+/- Moe artstyle (Dependent on your view of moe)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack for Netoge really...isn't all that special.  There's nothing that really stands out aside from them being a pair of really cutesy OP and ED combo that expresses the main romance of the series between Hideki and Ako (or Rusian and Ako to be more exact).  They're not really special, they're not unique, so they're as a result not really very memorable.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I was following the manga before the anime's release and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Due to scans slowing down, the anime caught up and went far beyond the original source material, so there really isn't enough to make a comparison one way or the other.  What I can say is that despite its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  I'm one of those suckers for a good OTP, and despite the show sorta...pasting them together, the Ako x Rusian ship was pretty cute.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  As a gamer, I recognized/understood pretty much all of what the show was showing us and really enjoyed the different aspects overall.  Ako is such a wonderfully weird character that really breathed life into this show due to how much was actually focused onto her, and the show really didn't let go of anything that it had plot-wise throughout its whole run.  (Although it may have had a tough time balancing everything all at once though.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nReally though, it's the ending that kills the show for me.  I'm not gonna spoil what happens, but many romance anime do it, and it is just not fun to watch anytime they do it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fun and not so serious game-related anime, then Netoge is worth a shot.  It's a largely story-based anime that concentrates on its aspects of romance, reconditioning, and games throughout its entire runtime, while adding some slight fanservice that doesn't really take too much away from the show, mixing it altogether with character development that is actually pretty noticeable as the episodes roll by.  The characters aren't all too deep or complex, but it has some merit to it and in my opinion, is an all-around decent show.",

There is a main plot in this anime, which is to get the female main to understand that the reality and in-game worlds are separated. However, this plot is not very well developed as it isn't focused on, even though it is the main plot. Despite this, there are many many other sub-plots which were very interesting to watch.\r\nThis anime includes multiple female roles. However, this is not a harem anime! The male main shares his love with only one female. That being said, their relationship is abit weird but also interesting because of the fact the female main cannot or has difficulty seperating the in game world and reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is pretty modern, and very well animated.

Yeah, it's about a random guy who's guildmates all happen to be hot girls. Yeah, it makes use of some very common tropes. But the whole anime is so over the top that it's silly and enjoyable. There is an absurd amount of fanservice, but that goes along with the ridiculousness of the rest of the anime. There's many references to MMO culture and that's probably my favorite part of the anime ie. skimpy female armor. It's overallpretty fun to watch if you see it for what it is.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAh the difference between realities and how this can affect our personalities and our way of thinking, what this show does is when you become consumed with virtual reality and forget the real world so luckily this only happens to a very cute girl who ends up having to pull her friends into a really complicated situation.\r\nIn a Game called Legendary Age Hideki AKA Rusian proposes to a girl while in game yet tells him she is a dude thus making Hideki think every girl gamer is a complete lie that is until he meets Ako a nooby who he encounters whojust so happens to be in love with him, sadly she can't tell the difference between real life and the game world.\\n\r\nNow I'm a big fan of Romance's and how this played out was actually pretty different for once and it attracts people like myself who are gamer's which adds another nice element to it.\\n\r\nIt was really fun seeing Hideki and his friends trying their best to show Ako that the game and the real world are two different things and the things they do to show this don't really help, but the outcome is actually really funny and the interactions between Hideki and Ako can be pretty cute since that they are married in the game she believes they are also married in real life so she always acts lovey dovey with him.\\n\r\nIt is also interesting how we get to see the characters perspective in real life and in the game that they play and how they act differently since some of the characters in the group have positions they don't want to be ruined just because they are playing a game, however when it comes to the game it was fun seeing how the group worked together to handle quests or taking a Castle from a rival guild even if the outcome for them isn't always good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually pretty fun and very likeable I didn't find anyone dislikeable or annoying in anyway.\\n\r\nHideki AKA Rusian is the male MC and is Ako's husband in the game and in real life too in Ako's eyes, he is a pretty straightforward and honest guy and takes the relationship between him and Ako very seriously even if that seriousness doesn't get through to Ako, he does get stressed a lot since explaining things to Ako can be difficult, but he puts up with it like a champ and states her as an important person in his life especially since she is actually a girl in real life and not some dude.\\n\r\nAko is the female MC and is definitely one of the cutest characters I've seen even if she can't tell the difference between the game and the real world, a lovable Deredere she always clings onto Rusian whenever she can, but she does listen to him and takes his and her friends words into consideration since they are trying to help her although she can be pretty dim, clumsy and forgettable since she would rather spend her days on games rather than going to school, however she can be a little creepy when people start talking about normies which she thinks are scum, but she is pretty much an adorable character.\\n\r\nAkane AKA Schwein is in real life somebody that Hideki avoids, but in the game she is a good friend of his and when they meet in real life it was definitely surprising to them, she is your usual Tsundere and is actually a likeable one as she always gets annoyed when people call her Schwein after she finds out it means Pig, but she can be a good friend as long as it doesn't affect her status in school.\\n\r\nKyou is the leader of the gamer group and the Student council president at the school, she is actually a very good leading hence her position in both of these places and cares a lot for her gamer friends yet thanks to her rich family she wouldn't hesitate to use money just to unlock better weapons and armour to make her look good.\\n\r\nYui is the teacher at the others school and becomes their club advisor when they create their gaming club at school, she also turns out to be the person that Rusian proposed to that made him think all girls are dudes, she is actually a soft spoken person yet can be pretty strict especially when the others are being lazy and don't want to do anything productive unless it's to do with games.\\n\r\nNanako is Akane's best friend and becomes a member of the group later on in the show, at first because of her interactions with Hideki she is disliked by Ako until she said she was just joking around with him then overtime they slowly become friends, she is a very fun girl and usually tries to keep a positive essence going.\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle is actually a lot more shiny and sparkly compared to other anime's I've seen which can be said for the female characters eyes that just look very infectious like you can't you eyes off them, I really liked the way the game was designed as it was obviously a shout out to League of Legends, but the characters looked really well designed both in the game and in real life too especially when they are all different classes so they have different armour and weapons to make them stand out, however there are points where they do check out other games like a Call of Duty type game which played more like a Battlefield game.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the comedic aspect was done really well as most of the time it's Ako causing the laughter as her decisions and skills in the game are poor and usually end up with the team getting beaten up by monsters or at least Rusian being beaten up by monsters and the other's would just clear them out and the same can be said in the real world as Ako's confusion with some things make it difficult for the others to explain what it is to her plus the whole interaction with the group is very well done and some of the other characters pull something out of nowhere that just becomes comedic gold.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Romance was actually good as well I liked the relationship between Hideki and Ako albeit a difficult relationship, but it was nice and even adorable seeing their interactions as both of them took the relationship seriously well in their own way and it was nice seeing it develop as Ako slowly started to see the differences between the worlds which built up their relationship and there was some serious moments too like when Hideki and Ako were on the beach sending off fireworks or when Hideki lost all of his gear when his account got hacked it did show that these two can have serious conversations and have it end up not being turned into a joke.\\n\\n\r\nThere was some fan service too like the usual beach trip episode and a bath episode too yet I thought these were okay and weren't placed badly in the show, I did enjoy some of the bikini's the girls wore and the bath episode was actually pretty funny as it turned into a chase as Ako was trying to contact Hideki for an answer via video chat and the others didn't want him to see them nude so it wasn't just there for sightseeing there was some funny stuff that came out of it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a nice different take on a Romance as there have been some fun, weird ones in the past like Midori days and Mysterious Girlfriend X and now this one can be added to that weird yet interesting bunch.",

This wasn't done gradually at all - it was a complete cop-out. \r\nThis 1) goes against his nonstop claim of \"it's not real - it's just a game !!\" argument; and 2) it takes away that aspect of there actually being differences from real-life and the game (minus the whole fantasy vs slice of life genre change). \r\nThe restof the series, tho, is quite enjoyable. It's a basic slice of life show, and there's nothing really to take away than feeling happy that these relative loners stopped being scared to meet and were able to live their school life a lot easier. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I also watched this whole thing dubbed. The voice choice and acting was rather fluid for most of the cast. The beginning is choppy without context, but it's not that bad. If you're not vehemently opposed to dubs, then do check it out so you can avoid watching the subs rather than the show.",

That is pretty much the only thing off about this anime. The ending suits how the anime should be except when he pulls awayfrom the girl which like come on dude make a decision.

            "content": "What I liked: The dynamics between characters, which makes their jokes funny (and at times hilarious) and their interactions meaningful. Good quality animation, very good voice acting. There were moments where I felt for characters, struggled not to die from laughter, and reflected on the times I played online games. The plot doesn't break any grounds, but instead takes a normal route and does it well.\r\nWhat could be better: The biggest one is, how did Ako become this borderline NEET? We only see her mother once and she seems to a levelled up version of Ako, but never see or hear anything of her again.Also, Rushian has a sister who only showed up in one scene, is that all? \\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm on the fense: The plot overrall is not very deep or mysterious, which is fine for me. Some might find it too simple, but I liked it. I wish they developed other characters besides the husband and wife.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like: Some of the plot devices are either too simplistic or not to my taste. Such as wasting days to just to set a trap and defeating the 'boss' purely by using money.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Great for a casual watch if you've the time. Don't set too high expectations, it's a simple but still enjoyable show scattered with bits of gems. I'd totally hope for a second season, and check out the light novel too.",

            "content": "A guilty pleasure, but a rather good one. The premise of four online friends being cute girls attending the same school as the hero...is presented shamelessly and sweetly enough, I swallowed it like candy. Much more jarring is the absurdly rich friend cliche; the former conceit is required to initiate the plot, the latter smooths away the difficulties and originality good stories require. The characters and plot are very much standard harem fare, with some tedious beach/big house/onsen eps (courtesy of the rich friend) dragging down in the middle. Animation is particularly bright, blobbish and underdetailed, with nothing but beautiful people, though the frequent fanserviceisn't forced or overwhelming. Music is decent but generic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the characters lack in originality and detail, however, they make up for in lively appeal. Segawa, the twintail girl, stands out for the freshness of her dialogue and motivation. A tsundere who really isn't obsessed with the hero ('though perhaps I like you a bit...baka!'), but has her own agenda of, say, concealing her netgaming passion, can be rather good. Hideki is a fairly standard put-upon harem lead, but at least Ako gives a good reason for falling in love with him, which he backs up by supporting her through her antics of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAko, the deredere leading lady is simply adorable. As an eccentric character she isn't a patch on Rikka from Chyunibou, but her emotional over-committal makes for charming fragility. She's simply too pure and silly for this Earth, so that Hideki's reluctance to take advantage of her love (hem hem) is very believable. Harem anime with a clear 'first girl' are usually the most convincing. An unforced love obstacle in Ako's emotional delusions, and the sheer wholesomeness of her affections make a very decent lead couple indeed, even if it's onward development isn't the very deepest. We do get to see some seedier elements of online gaming, without the series losing its basic optimism. There is, again, quite a bit of fanservice, but the basic story is quite light and charming.",

            "content": "When the first lines in a show go along the lines of \"Please marry me\", you pretty much have a good idea of where things will go. Netoge is an instant girlfriend show that was ridiculously popular when I visited Japan. The show focuses on the relationship between our protagonist, Hideki Nishimura aka Rusian, and his online wife, Ako. One day, his MMO guild decides to have a live meet up, lo and behold Ako is actually a bijin. Unfortunately, she can't seem to differentiate between the online 2D world and actual reality. Will our protagonist to able to convince her that they are notthe same thing?\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this show had a lot of promise early on; the premise reminded me of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu from oh goodness eight years ago. However, half way through the show it seemed to direction. Rather than focusing on the uniqueness of the characters' situation, it decided to focus instead on the gaming aspect; thus reducing the rest of the show to a standard school-based slice-of-life with a bit of MMO fantasy. Despite this, it is still an interesting watch. If you like romcoms or are looking for a show to make fun of MMO mechanics, definitely try this show out.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation quality in Netoge is fairly average overall. Background and scenery range from simplistic, computer-assisted images of school grounds to more detailed renderings of the fantasy world. The fantasy world is drawn slightly differently to help the viewer acclimate; there's stronger saturation in the colors and character outlines are drawn in a distinctive dark-blue color. Character drawing is a bit on the plain side; the flat character shading sometimes clashes with the more detailed, computer-generated backgrounds. All the characters are readily identifiable and, humorously, appear similar in the fantasy MMO world. Ako is particularly easy to spot with her ridiculously large blue eyes. The characters also have unique smiles that remind me of those in Denpa Onna.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a fair amount of action in this show, mostly the character's imaginations of the actual battle scenes in the MMO. There isn't any blood though there are many MMO character deaths and a few humorous group wipes. This isn't primarily an action show though so the choreography is only average and, other than showing a few fun MMO mechanics, the actual battles aren't too exciting. There is a moderate amount of ecchi in this show, ranging from bouncing body parts to multiple bath scenes. It's reasonably tame compared to true ecchi-based shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is a moderate-paced song with a decent melody; it reminds me a lot of the instrumentation used by ClariS. The ED is a playful song sung by one of our VAs; melodically it isn't as strong though. The BGM is distinctive for having a fittingly electronic feel, though it also has bits of your more traditional string instrumentation. Two or three playful tunes become familiar by the end of the show. Overall, the BGM is better than your average show but nothing too spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is a mix of veterans and up and coming talent. All of the VAs give fitting personalities to their respective roles though Inori Minase probably had the most challenging character to voice, not to mention the random pig references.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI always have a soft spot for shows that play into philosophical questions, even if they don't outright explore them in depth. In Netoge, we get to explore perspectives about identity and how our online and offline selves relate to one another. In particular, our protagonist has an online (married) relationship with another character. He then happens to meet the person playing that character in real life. How is he supposed to interact? Should he assume the persona that he was playing as online? Can he even do so after seeing how cute she is in person?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the improbability of an entire guild being at the same school and the unlikely nature of immediately becoming an ace PVP shooter in an online FPS with no prior experience, the show is a pretty well grounded and well rounded. The initial main plot revolves around getting Ako to start realizing the difference between the online and offline worlds, but honestly it doesn't make much progress. It's probably more accurate to treat this as more of a slice of life with occasional rounds in the fantasy world. The overall plot fits somewhat into roughly defined arcs that don't necessarily build to a climax, though there are occasional cliffhangers.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the nice plot elements, the show is also pretty entertaining in the comedic department. Expect a lot of laughs as characters occasionally behave in absurd ways, and expect some additional bonus laughs if you've played MMOs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show also impresses in terms of character personality. All of the main characters are pretty interesting and differentiated from your run of the mill cookie-cutter mold. Ako (healer) is a dynamic girl who somehow switches between anti-social mode and super-clingy girlfriend/wife mode. Kyou (ranged DPS) is a confident student council president (despite never seeming to have any actual duties) who happens to come from a rich family; her online persona literally represents the group of MMO players willing to dish out serious cash to make the freemium model work for the rest of us. Akane (melee DPS) is a hot-headed tsundere who secretly loves playing online games, her attempts to keep it a secret are pretty humorous. Finally, even our protagonist (tank) stands out from the typical nice guys- he can take care of business when it matters.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those shows where relationships are defined early in the show and then remain relatively stagnant thereafter. Though there aren't any truly dynamic characters, there is a good deal of nice character interactions. Expect romcom elements including third wheels and jealousy mixed in with the other story elements. There are a fair number of supporting characters but the show does a great job of maintaining focus on the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis is a pretty solid romcom with a decent mix of action and story as well. It intersects quite a few different genres but successfully does so without becoming an angry fruit salad. Though I would have liked more focus on relationships rather than MMO grinding - think I've seen enough of that for a lifetime already - it was nonetheless an entertaining and occasionally thought-provoking show. It's not at the level of something like Nisekoi but definitely above average overall. What are you waiting for? Game er... watch on!",

It just looks stupid and awkward. \r\nApart from that I guess I shouldnt be too harsh... It's kinda clishe like most anime nowadays (not many original ideas lately).

            "content": "Netoge is ultimately harmless entertainment. It'll occupy a few hours and that's about it. It's probably not going to have a lasting impact on your life. But after all it's not intended to, it's a genre piece that sets out to entertain fans of the genre and it does a fairly admirable job of that. Unfortunately that's all it does. It isnt a show that is trying to, or is capable of \"converting\" people who arent already fans of the now fairly formulaic \"highschool comedy ecchi harem\" genre. You can of course criticse it for not being particularly believable (it's not intended to be), forpresenting an obviously fictional and somewhat idealised take on teenage romance (as intended), of trivialising serious commitments like marriage (like comedys tend to) and so on. But the point I'm, laboriously, getting at is that these criticisms can be leveled at nearly any entry in this genre, and at the end of the day miss the mark by condemning these shows for not living up to an arbitrary standard they were never aiming for. Is the criticism valid? Well it's as valid as any criticism is, but its also not very useful. So by now you should have a good idea if this is the kind of show you can stomach or not. \\n\\n\r\nIf it does fall within your bailiwick you may wonder what does it have to offer? Well the animation is surprisingly well done. It also makes some clever use of intertwining the reality of the players playing the game and how they imagine the game taking place (most anime seem to only use the latter, as its more visually engaging). The characters are familiar but have the odd little twist here and there that does provide a bit of interest for even the more jaded fan. The show does a good job of presenting the MC as a fairly average, if otakuish, nice guy. He has friends and seems to fit in fairly well with his peers, he also doesnt take advantage of Ako's psychological issues. Sometimes MC's in shows like this can come across as milquetoast's who are unbelievably resistant to the charms of girls their age. But there's a reason for his hesitance in this case and it feels like he goes about trying to make a real relationship with Ako, \"the right way\". The harem is also amazingly shallow, if its there at all, the show has one main relationship and all the characters seems fully aware of it. VA and sound design in general is solid and the story moves along at a fairly decent pace. At the end of the season it manages to make you feel that you've seen a somewhat complete story but also leaves the way open for a possible sequel. \\n\\n\r\nI do think they could have done more with the premise, after all plenty of the people in the real world have met and got married in online games and then transitioned that relationship into the main world. But a more dramatic take on the subject matter wouldnt have suited what this set out to be, a fairly by the numbers highschool romantic comedy. They do sort of dance around how emotionally damaged the two main characters are, but the drama is generally kept fairly light, if you were feeling generous you could suggest it adds a rather dark undertone to the whole thing (but I think thats probably reading a bit too deep)\\n\\n\r\nThis may seem like its damning with faint praise but ultimately it is what it is, which as I stated in my opening line is harmless entertainment. If its your kind of thing I dont think you'll regret the three or four hours you spend on it.",

Another oddity is that we have a 1:5 guy to girl ratio in our cast. These are odd things because the likelihood of either of these is pretty damn unlikely, unheard of even.\r\nLooking past that, the big issue to our cast is that they want to keep their Avatar Life separateto their Real Life.\\n\\n\r\nActually all but one want this.

There were things I could relate to and laugh at because I knew what these characters did or were going through.

Where the primary focus of the clubs problems gets solved. Then therest of the show is kinda like filler were the relationship between characters doesn't change from that stopping point in episode 5. \\n\r\nHonestly speaking this show could've been a \"5\" for me if it ended at episode 5. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nforgettable I didn't hate it expect for the opening song so it has that going for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThere's only one character thats the primary focus of this show and its Ako \"the girl online\" this character is a weird freak of MOE to the likes I was honestly surprised by. I this anime came from America I wouldn't be surprised if I saw her drinking and eating \"gamer fuel\" with Doritos and mountain dew. But thanks to glorious japan we got a scene about drinking piss instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are cookie cutter basic stereotypes except for ako's mom which was my favorite scene in this anime and only appears in that scene. \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment of the series: 3\\n\r\nIts honestly the about of times I chuckled with episode 5 being the exception.\\n\\n",

            "content": "While having some pretty decent moments, And You Never Thought There is a  Girl Online, for the most part, fell a bit flat.\r\nThe story actually started off quite nicely. With the first few episodes, we get some plot twists that honestly surprised me (even some friends who were also watching the show). It's within these episodes where we're established with what the main plot is. However, at times, I question what the real plot is. In one episode, we're tackling the main issue, but then the next just has everyone dealing with some events in the game. It obviously did not surprise me tosee that the main conflict isn't solved in the end; I've seen too many shows that finish off basically saying \"Yeah, back to square one!\"\\n\\n\r\nI would say the characters are below average. They're all right and have their own personalities, but we don't really get to know a whole lot about them. At times, we have characters who only appeared briefly at first become more prominent to the story, but when they do so about halfway through, it feels like they're there only for the sake of being there.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like everything else in this series, the animation is decent. I notice there is frequent detail in the faces during close-ups, especially on the female lips. There were a few hiccups on character model consistency and movement, but knowing the studio, I'd say this is a step up from their last production.\\n\\n\r\nAnd You Never Thought There is a Girl Online was very in the middle for me. Nothing about it really stood out, yet nothing about it was all that terrible. Perhaps one of the reasons could be that I'm not an online gamer and can't really relate to the characters that are playing them. Or it could be that I saw the inevitability of the story never getting a solid resolution and just decides to go back to square one like many other shows. If that's the kind of stuff you don't like in a show, then this may not be the one for you.",

            "content": "It's a good brainless comedy, but a few lazy decisions and a dozen tropes bring the series down.\r\nI'll start with my [major] complaints: \r\nTypical (i.e.  nonexistent) harem character development, where MC goes from bewildered and lost to simply embarrassed, and your bog standard tsun tsun in to \"secretly I'm not a bad person but I will still tease you in private and treat you like trash in public\" harem member. Other character don't even have that.\r\nOut of place fanservice, mainly by the means of awkward camera angles and out of place zooms, in otherwise more or less civil situations.\r\nLack of real story and romanticline. They are there, but end up in more or less the same state as they started. \\n\\n\r\nMMO theme seems like a cop out or an afterthought. Once again you get the feeling that writers heard about MMOs, but not sure what they are. Most of the gameplay consist of abstract XP grinding and sitting around in a tavern, chatting.\\n\r\nAlso, with all the jokes about powerful PCs, some modern hardware product placements and despite that everyone seems to run win10, the game they play is about as old as Ragnarok Online. \\n\\n\r\nSeries also suffer from the good old \"oh shit, we need something interesting to happen in the last 3 episodes\" syndrome. So everyone suddenly becomes interested in PvP, convenient rivals are added and a forced conflict is ready!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a separate point from character development, I wanted to mention how little sense some (most) of them make. There is a very clear line between having strong convictions and just being badly written. We never really get a clear answer for most of character motivations, that is, until you realize that they are just filling in your standard trope roles. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, with all that said, why did I enjoy it, rating it above average? Mainly because it has an interesting start and a decent main part. Because I actually finished it, without loosing interest of forgetting about it for a year or five. But most of all, because it made me laugh, despite (or maybe because of) it's flaws. \\n\\n\r\nHarem was not intrusive or detrimental, like it is most of the time, and series  had good jokes, and not just typical moe crap.  Female lead is actually interesting, when she's not busy being batshit crazy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Probably not. There are better series for any sub-genre this one has. But if you're bored, and you absolutely need something about video games, you can do much wore than this. \\n\\n",

I figured that this show might be an interesting take on this type of thing.\r\nI ended up with mixed feelings about the show.\r\nNetoge (we'll call it this for short) does a pretty good job of humorously exploring the types of personalities thatone meets and interacts with in an online game and I found many of the characters and situations pretty similar to personalities that I found in my real life gaming experiences, so there was quite a bit of \"yup, they nailed that archetype\" while watching the show.  I thought that the show did a good job of doing various game related activities and challenges that were pretty entertaining if you are into gaming culture.  While not as absurd as some shows in the gaming genre (D-Frag comes to mind) there is enough exaggeration to properly lampoon a lot of gaming culture while never getting TOO unbelievable.  \\n\\n\r\nTechnically the show does pretty average to fair.  The art is nothing extraordinary, but is colorful and pleasing to the eyes.  The sound and voice acting is pretty good, and character personality shines through pretty well.  \\n\\n\r\nWhere I thought the show stumbled a bit was in the make up of the main group and some of the characterizations.  Coming from a light novel, it's unfortunate that some of the harem tropes carried over, but they are what they are.  I think the group dynamic could have used at least one other male supporting character in the main group to make things a little more interesting and add some more possibilities for showing the online gaming culture and life.  I was a bit skeptical that many of the guys in the main character's class did not play the game with all the main girls and the lead.  I feel this was a bit of a missed opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, I'd say that the characters could have used a little bit more development as the story progressed as well.  They play their archetypes well and provide good entertainment, but I feel that many people that aren't as well versed in the ins and outs of online gaming culture may find some of the interactions get repetitive as the show goes on.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite my quibbles, I did find the show entertaining, although I think that it has a lot to do with having experience in the subject matter the show is exploring and seeing a lot of humor and relating to the characters.  I feel that someone's enjoyment of the show is going to hinge a lot on whether or not they have some experience with gaming culture and can find humor in the character archetypes and the situations.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure this show can stand on its own merits as anything above average.  It's not a terrible show, but there are better options.\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend this show if you have experience in online gaming culture and don't mind the light novel adaptation scenario.  I didn't find this as entertaining as some other shows based around games, but I didn't regret watching it.  It had its charm and was one of those \"guilty pleasure\" type watches.  \\n\\n\r\nNo game no life, D-Frag, and even to some extent Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai do the gaming in the \"real world\" concept in a stronger way if you are looking for similar shows about games.\\n",
