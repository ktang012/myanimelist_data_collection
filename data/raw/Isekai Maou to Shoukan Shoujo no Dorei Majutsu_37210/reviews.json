            "content": "Anime series that solely exists for the boobs, butts and fanservice?\r\nWhat type of a pathetic person would even watch such a thing?\r\nNot me at least.\r\n \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\r\n*I saw the uncensored version, this review is aimed for adult audience only, just like the anime.*\r\nEver since Sword Art Online landed, the anime industry has been trying their hardest to do clones of it. Clones which go beyond all the things that made SAO an ironic masterpiece. When Death March aired few seasons back, I thought no one would dare to take any more ridiculous self-insert isekai harem route. Apparently, the exact opposite happened, and Isekai Maou toShoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (How Not to Summon a Demon Lord) was released. Show so ridiculously awesome its English name had to be changed just so people wouldn't think it's a hentai series\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThere is this self-insert dude who has apparently never even spoken with a real person in their life, but he is really good at being isekai Jesus in this video game that everyone plays. A legend, a hero, everything person can achieve in a game and more, that's his role. Just so happens to be, these 2 girls do forbidden magic and summon the Jesus behind the game avatar to fill his in-game character. This start an epic adventure focusing around many plot related factors such as kissing, boob fondling and various sexual remarks. \\n\\n\r\nIt would be easy to mistake the series to have a loosely written story because of its settings. But that's just an assumption by those who do not know better! The writer constantly challenges his writing skills by cornering the story with wits never seen before in the animated medium. For one, during this one inn scene, our trio got a room with only one small bed. Isn't it impossible for 3 people to sleep on such a small bed? Ikr, but no! Our author found a way to get everyone well-rested, and even had the time to suck neko girl's ears, making her happy, followed by a 1,5 minute long boob fondling scene. Every situation that looks beyond hopeless, gets eventually turned positive in ways you would never expect (unless you expect them to be related to lust, in which case you will not be surprised).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Strike the Blood was the amount of girls it had for the viewer to choose from. Who is the best girl and who the canon pairing. These were questions that made watching it almost stressful due to the meat quantity. Decisions, decisions. Masosoma has fixed these huge problems in two ways. a) there are only 2 girls that matter and all the others are just noncanon pairing hoes b) you don't need to choose as you can have them both. \\n\\n\r\nShera is the perfect Elf girl and looks exactly the same as blonde from Sukebe Elf no Mori e. Moreover, she has huge boobs. Rem is where lolicon fetish meets S&M bondage. But really, she has animal ears, so naturally, owning a huge metal collar is just an essential part of her design and not a questionable choice the least. Her eye color is also green which is the only color that really matters. Unfortunately they don't seem to have personalities, but I am certain both of them are especially good at sucking... things. . \\n\\n\r\nOur Kirito is called Diablo this time. He is also voiced by Ono Saisuke v.2.0, so you know he is awesome. By awesome, I mean a total loser, but still gets to live the ideal life of a lawful wish fulfillment swagnator, and has the most alpha voice imaginable. Other than his hands, which seem to have endless stamina when it comes to harassing women, his other best merit is anything he ever let's out of his mouth. When he called that nerdy mage a mega pleb, I removed all characters from my favorite lists just because none of them has as long of an e-penis, and when he gave his monologue praising both: small and big boobs, I had no choice but to make \"Big boobs fill man's hand, small boobs fill man's heart.\" my new favorite philosophical quote. \\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, according to my calculations, the series has offered us around 27 scenes that have moved the plot onward with audiovisual story telling (pantsu shots, bakaboats, pointy nipples etc.). That's all really cool. Outside the things that matter, the art and animation are based medium quality. The boob bouncing, especially during walking scenes, is animated in an extremely fluid manner, and goes in perfect harmony with the bouncy sounds, making the series almost hypnotic for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nFinal judgement. Censored version 1/10. Uncensored version 10/10. Should be watched by anyone who thought Sutobura saved anime there were Kill la Kill failed.",

            "content": "Here we have another isekai-harem LN adaptation, as is though shared with many similar series of the kind, and this season alone, This is the ONLY Isekai LN adaptation that you should watch this season (and going forward) as it's largely competent on the likes of Overlord (similar but different)?\r\nAnd also, just go for the uncensored version of the anime, that always helps if you love insane amounts of fanservice with boobage, ecchi shots and whatnot! You can thank me later.\r\nStory:\r\nHere we go again...yet another \"transported into another world\" (more like self-inserted) fantasy series of some random dude who managed to beat the game, knowits innards, specs and whatnot, and then suddenly finding himself IN the actual game! With a bunch of girls that are reverse-magical slaved and self-locked into our MC with boob touches and physics, follow the Demon King Diablo on his every step of the way, going towns, encountering allies and enemies, showing off his OP skills and \"tactics\" every so often while finding a solution to rid those chains! And who doesn't want to watch a perverted MC have his subconscious way with \"hit-and-miss\" intentions of the harem?\\n\\n\r\nThe only difference in Isekai Maou: there's actual progressive story and subversion plot points that are oh-so-predictable yet satisfying to watch. It's like you're watching an actual playthrough of the game itself! You probably thought that the usual Isekai clich\u00e9 troupes will work against it, but nope! With decent execution, and the overtime boringness that sets in (your tastes vary, I'm not gonna judge), at least it manages to keep the investment level of the series high like the Almighty, and best of all? It doesn't feel cringeworthy whatsoever, even with the forced humor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFor a cheap knock-off of the most OP character (reference to a certain Death March), Sakamoto Takuma a.k.a Summoning Master and Demon King, Diablo, is both a visual treat and a sight to behold. Other than his OP skills which have the \"woah\" factor, at least he has the audacity to act with the \"sensitivity and righteousness\" behaviour while playing the Demon King act. And for that, he gets a thumbs up for not being the (fill in the blank)-AF character like so many other mediocre series does with the archetype. Anyone who has been burnt out with Diablo's character will appreciate that he stands out in the most fitting way possible.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the girls then:\\n\r\nShera the Elf with giant boobs. What more could you want with her EVERY movement with oh-so-jiggly boobs that always make Diablo cringe at the thought of it? More or less, all the subversive moments of squeezing boobs just makes it more worthwhile to watch this far none.\\n\r\nRem the flat-chested Neko. As if someone with large boobs isn't enough, how about one with a flat chest, but also \"smooth to the touch\" that makes you wanna cringe so hard? Not to mention, her lolicon look and the cat-fested ears just made it so that she could orgasm at the sight of sucking and caressing her gentle ears with hot blemishes!\\n\r\nKlem, the TRUE Demon Lord of Cross Reverie, looks menacing at first glance, but here comes another loli girl with the love of biscuits (or most likely any satiating food HAHA), kinda liked her character for the most part, even with the eventual full-power release.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are reminiscent of the vibes that are founded by the ironic SAO-ish quirks:\\n\r\nAlicia, working for the Imperial Army, she comes off as being an aloof female warrior. At first, her attempts of working with Diablo, Shera and Rem come across as just another insert-yourself-into-the-harem clich\u00e9, but once the \"true\" Demon King is unleashed, her \"ignorance is bliss\" attitude starts showing with intensity. So much so that even the OP scenes outlined this (if you looked hard enough).\\n\\n\r\nKeera, the evil brother of Shera, the S&M specialist. No words can describe him, as per to a certain mad scientist on the other side. He is truly despicable to the point of no return. \"All I wanted for family is you\"? Yea right, you degenerate piece of shit! Every troupe here clearly exemplifies the conglomeracy of it all, with this one character.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nAjia-do Animation Works is an obscure studio that has a long history like veterans Toei Animation or Sunrise, but their repertoire of works are subpar, with the only well-received series being Pierrot's follow-up of Emma Season 2, and that was back in 2007. So if you're an anime studio nut like myself, think of this obscure studio as the equivalent of Pierrot in terms of animation quality, just mildly better.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with Isekai Maou, there is the Ajia-do trait of limited animation quality (especially with noticeable long-distance/range backgrounds), but it is vastly improved and the 2D artwork doesn't disappoint. Along with the action sequences, it doesn't give off the feel that the producers cheaped out on both the art and animation. To quote an example, check out the catchy OP sequence where Shera's giant \"knockers\" boobs slap each other for an insane 2 second-cut (near the chorus part). Now that is attention to detail. Overall, good art and animation, and props to the production staff.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe OST is one of the tolerable ones this season: An all-star female VA casting for the OP and Yuu Serizawa with the help of HoneyWorks' CHiCO for the ED. Just knowing that the veteran seiyuus all sound so good, you can't help but to be immersed in the OST. From the battle scenes that are full or intensity to the action that keeps pumping non-stop, honestly I enjoyed myself with all that is to offer here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Isekai Maou is a series that at least does the tri-factor (Isekai, LN-harem, ecchi) genres some justice, and with the original source material comes criticisms that many people will pass off as some unnecessary filler. But to be quite honest, while I don't love this anime, the enjoyment factor is really where it's at to see these characters mingle with a story that's so stupid, it's entertaining much. To the haters, at least give this a second chance or something, I promise you, it's not as taxing as many mediocre isekai series out there.",

            "content": "Ever wanted to know what it feels like to own someone? I\u2019m not talking about people who you hire or a business partner. I\u2019m talking about if you actually hold ownership of someone like a slave. Taking on the role of a protagonist in a fantasy world is no easy task. Even for a guy like Sakamoto Takuma, he may be an experienced gamer but he\u2019s never been equipped to deal with a life changing event such as being transported into the very game he played. After becoming \u201cDiablo\u201d, he learns that the hard way.\r\nIsekai Maou no Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (otherwise known asHow Not to Summon a Demon Lord) is exactly what it looks like \u2013 a show about a demon lord who gets summoned into this fantasy world. The juicy part of the show is that the main protagonist possesses a \u201cslave-turning\u201d skill that allows him to enslave others. True to its form, this anime sets off so many damn red flags that it became of those cases of being so bad, it\u2019s almost good.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie. This show glorifies fan service at any chances it gets so be prepared for a whole feast of them. The first few episodes makes it clear that the two main girls \u2013 Shera and Rem serves as Ms. Fanservice. It doesn\u2019t help with the fact that around their neck are collars standing as proof of their enslavement status. As a guy with poor social skills, Diablo have trouble building a connection with his two slaves at first. My early impression of Diablo is that he is a joke of himself. Being a Demon Lord with such power is like an unholy gift but he doesn\u2019t truly know what to do with it. Furthermore, Shera and Rem doesn\u2019t know anything about him and vice versa. However, it does show that Shera adores Diablo and is \u201cimpressed\u201d by his skills. Then, there\u2019s Rem who shows little respect to Diablo at first but does warm up to him as they get to know each other more. In a stereotypical manner, they grow closer together and seems the two main girls even develop feelings toward their master. Yet, Diablo still has to hold his urges of lust whenever he gets caught into compromised positions. If you\u2019ve seen any Isekai series of similar nature, you\u2019ll know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched more and more of this anime, it seems the show does take on a more emotional side once it decided to focus more on the characters. Despite his poor social skills, Diablo shows a genuine caring side towards his two slaves. This is shown in later episodes when he decides to risk everything to save Shera. He even begins to enjoy his new life as a Demon Lord and make the best of it without jeopardizing others. His main goal transform from ruling the world to being a trustworthy master to his slaves. By nature, it\u2019s a peculiar sense to develop a character but somewhat works this way because of Diablo\u2019s personality. He\u2019s a haughty guy with a lot of pride on his side but sometimes drops his guard when it involves his two slaves. On the other hand, I think it\u2019s a cheap ploy by the creators to get the audience to like Diablo. Because let\u2019s face it, Diablo is still a generic character that adheres to wish fulfillment fantasies. So many isekai series pulls this trick from the book and it\u2019s impossible to overlook this show\u2019s pitfalls.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I also have to proclaim that it\u2019s very easy to overlook the other characters outside of the main trio. We got characters like the Fallen (Demonic Being) Edelgard making her debut early on. Does anyone actually care about this character? She speaks broken sentences and plays more of the role of a combatant. Oh and I can\u2019t forget how absurd her personality changes from time to time depending on who she faces with. Other characters like Sylvie and Alicia represents archetypes like the guild master and honorable knight you can find in almost any video game. And of course, they had to add Glebsklem into the show so that the cast would be complete with a half-naked loli. That\u2019s not even the worst part. If we look at the antagonists of the series, they are what really holds the character cast back. Every villain in the show are one dimensional characters with their own self-interest and greed. Some even have other sins that pushes the line of the show\u2019s censorship. I can\u2019t fandom how these antagonists were made except perhaps to tests the limits of Diablo\u2019s powers. The obvious result is that Diablo overcomes his obstacles because how overpowered he is. It\u2019s lack of creativity 101 that hardly takes any effort for anyone to make these type of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAjia-Do worked on a variety of genres before but this is their first full TV anime adaptation based on a light novel. By technical standards, it looks vibrant and matches with what an isekai world should look like. The high fantasy elements of the magical creatures and archaic structures are within expectation. Plus, some of the action scenes carries sufficient details to prove what Diablo is capable of. However, be aware of the show\u2019s fan service. In some episodes, it really pushes the envelope with the \u201caction\u201d. Scenes that includes fingering, sexual power restoration, and tentacles made this anime look like a cartoony porn. It\u2019s also impossible to not take eyes off of Shera\u2019s body. The camera plays around her breasts like they have a life of its own. Clothes are also blown off constantly for specific \u201creasons\u201d that puts Rem to shame. Character expressions often include their screams of passion in moments of ecstasy. Thanks to the talents of the VA, they make those scenes look more lascivious than they should.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an unwritten rule where people drop episodes for a show after three episodes or less. For Isekai Maou, it will most likely take one. It\u2019s a break or take for first impression and if you\u2019re coming in with low expectations, then do yourself a favor and hit that drop button. If you make it beyond those passionate screams of our slave girls, then this may be a sexy rollercoaster. The main trio of Diablo, Shera, and Rem carries this anime so get used to that. Does that still make this anime an enjoyable experience in the end? Hell no.",

            "content": "Personally, I love these types of shows and I promise it isn't the fanservice. I love overpowered MC's. It's just a matter of what personality they have. And this is one that I like a lot. The MC has been socially disconnected his entire life and has to interact with other NPCs(?) using his game persona. This leads to funny moments and surprisingly cool reactions that aren't standard for typical lead male roles (don't get me wrong there are moments like those in this).\r\nIt really is the MC that determines if the show is good or not.\r\nOn its surface, this is simply another power fantasywhere a socially inept hikikomori ends up in a game world somehow, where he is completely OP. Overlord, Log Horizon, and others do the same thing so why not watch one of those? Because, my friend, this show is chock full of ecchi ridiculousness and, God, is it great.\\n\\n\r\nYou want a huge, bodacious elf rack which defies the laws of physics? \\n\r\nYou want a cat girl waifu who hasn't quite developed in all areas just yet?\\n\r\nYou want to see awkward sexual scenarios with our socially inept protagonist and the face-meltingly hot ladies?\\n\r\nYou want all of this crammed into an \"isekai\" show with good animation and an actual okay plot so far?\\n\r\nShut in gamer MC?

            "content": "Summer 2018 had been a ride of an anime this year. From the unexpected Season 3 of Overlord, the return of a massive anime Attack On Titan, to the anime where summer is all about the fun as well as isekai shows that needed to be judged alot. This summer, we have plenty of isekai to judge on and one of them is \"How Not To Summon A Demon Lord.\" where at first it looks like it is another isekai trash with uncapable of a protagonist, although at least it is not like that. Also, for some reasons, I call this show a lite versionof Overlord. Lets found out why.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe anime starts off with your typical MC being so overpowered ingame that I don't even know how many times this scene was repeated on other isekai genre shows. Anyways, overpowered MC got transported to a fantasy world which is base on the game he amounted his life on instead of getting a college degree and get a job. Then his eyes caught upon two girls. An Elf and a Beast (cat?) girl. The girls thought that they summon a beast and that beast will be their \"slave\" (pet), but it turns out the magic is reflected to the two girls becoming them the slaves of op protagonists named Diablo. There, it starts all the threesome harem that every audience will expect on this show and the conflicts of having a slave that have internal conflicts.\\n\r\nMany people call this anime a lite version of Overlord because unlike many isekai shows, in Overlord and on this anime, the protagonist has an objective and personality, both we can see while we are watching. We get to know their interests as well as their uninterests on certain things. Though, this anime and Overlord share good protagonists, the harem and fanservice is still a nuisance to the story of this anime (although its pretty much ok). Unlike in Overlord where there's no fanservice and harem, it focuses more on how the protagonist will conquer the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nVisuals will always be important on a show where harem and fanservice is part of the story. I mean, the whole purpose of fanservice.. is fan.. service... On visual terms, How Not To Summon A Demon Lord is an okay show for it. Its not that bad as well as not that good. The details of the spells are done nicely, as well as the environment, monsters and character outlines. Not to mention, the visuals of the OP and ED matches the show quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI, to be honest, not the fan of the OP and ED of the show. I always skip it although it doesn't say its really bad for my taste. It is just not my type of music. However, the background music where the anime runs is quite good. It matches scenes where either a battle is going on, or whether the two girls Rem and Shera cling on Diablo naked and Diablo overreacting on his mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNow here is the interesting part of the anime. Characters. I mentioned earlier how the main protagonist is similar to the Overlord protagonist where both shows personality that pick our interest to watch the show every week. I'll now talk about the other characters especially the two girls Rem and Shera. What I like about this two girls is that they are also not your typical harem girls to the protagonist. They also have traits and importance to the story that if they are not present, the story will not progress at all. Shera being a very important person to a nation becoming a slave is already a one big conflict to everyone and Diablo. Then Rem holding one of the most hidden secrets across the world that only Diablo and the high mage named Celestine knows. Then we are provided by supporting characters that not only shows the might of Diablo but his willingness to protect these two girls. The fights shows how he is willing to sacrifice himself to the girls knowing some battles are pretty hard for him but he always win anyways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIsekai shows are not really that enjoyable as they are repeated always. Fanservice is always irritating and the story lacks elements that a story needs to be. However, this show, having a good protagonist, makes the story progress in the right path for the setting of the story. Making it automatically enjoyable for me to watch and making me wait for a week for an another episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"How Not To Summon A Demon Lord.\" is like an upgraded version of your always typical isekai with harem and fanservice cliche that you always want. It's a good isekai to watch on unlike many others that have MC that is boring and have a pointless harem.",

            "content": "If I had a choice to kill off a genre it would be Isekai. Out of all the anime genres, the Isekai genre seemed to be the one to annoy me to end due to how poorly written and pandering most of the shows of the Isekai genre are. Say all you want about ecchi + harems but least they are for the most part dump fun shows that respect its own target audience not to mention most of the ecchi + harems anime are self-aware of how cheesy and for the most part bad they are. However, this self-awareness rarely happens in Iseaki asmost of the shows tried to be more epic and seriously than they are actually are and most of the shows end up failed due to poor writing and direction.\\n\\n\r\nHow to not summon a demon Lord is no different in fact it's one of the worse Isekai anime I have seen period. While it isn't as offensive as The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar and In a Another World With my Smartphone it's still is a pretty awful anime with hardly any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Now with that said let's dive in into the Isekai rabbit hole.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a Hikikomori gamer named Takuma Sakamoto who is mysteriously transported to the world of his favourite MMORPG, Cross Reverie, with the appearance of his own character in the game, the Demon Lord Diablo. The two young girls who summoned him, the pantherian Rem and the elf Shera, attempt to use a spell to make Takuma their servant, but due to his passive \"Magic Reflection\" ability, the spell rebounds, and both end up with magic collars stuck on their necks, thus becoming his slaves instead. With a serious case of social anxiety, Takuma decides to act like his character while interacting with others, and makes use of his high stats and vast knowledge of Cross Reverie's lore to survive in his new environment, travelling along with Rem and Shera to look for a way to remove their slave collars while helping them with their own, personal issues that led them to summon him in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nJust with like with every bad Isekai anime the story of How to Not Summon a Demon Lord is non existent at best mainly because instead of telling a story that has a purpose this crap feast decided to be another crappy isekai story that is filled with fan-service and contrived characters arcs that serve no purpose other to show how overpowered the main character while the females act like damsel in distresses.\\n\r\nThe story, for the most part, is terribly paced as the fan-service as well the action scenes seemed to drag on way longer than they should. The writing of the show ranges from below average at best to absolutely terrible at worst as the show constantly likes to pander to the lowest common denominator of anime fans.\\n\r\nIt's doesn't help that the comedy in this show is pretty damm bad as not only the jokes got annoying as the series progressed but the comedy itself is unfunny and lame for the most part.\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for the story is that this show at various times took itself way too seriously for it's good. This was present in the second half of the series where the show was trying to more epic than it actually is and because of that the show became pretty pretentious at various moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is awful.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much better as they all boring and uninspired walking cliches.\\n\\n\r\nDiaibo is a typical overpowered protagonist that we all seen before and just like many overpowered protagonist that came before him his is bland and uninteresting. However, I will give Diabio this unlike other overpowered characters he can be a bit funny at times but at the same time he's jokes can be pretty repetitive and annoying.\\n\r\nThe two female characters that follow Diaibo are nothing but fetish husk bait for the viewer. Both are not worth mentioning at all because they do is ride either in the protagonist dick or act like damsel in distress in certain points in the series so that overpowered kun can save them.\\n\r\nThe same thing can apply for the rest of the female characters in this show.\\n\r\nAs for the villains they are all SAO levels of bad as all of them are evil for the sake of being evil. Hell one of the villains in the middle of the series looks like a bootleg Sugou from the Althem arc of Sword Art Online.\\n\r\nOverall like with the story the characters in How to Not Summon a Demon Lord are awful.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that I consider to be good about this shit show that it would be the visuals.\\n\r\nThe show is pretty to look at as it's filled with great use of vibrant colours for the character designs as well the background scenery.\\n\r\nThe actual animation is pretty solid overall that is decently smooth and the fights have pretty decent fight choreography.\\n\r\nWhile the visuals were pretty good I have one complainant with the visuals that certain characters are way too oversexualized. While it's as bad not as The Master Of Rock Bottom where the all of the female characters inducing young children are oversexualized for no reason it's still just an unpleasant sight to see characters that have young looking bodies doing sexual acts on screen.\\n\r\nOne more thing I can complain about the visuals is how the show used it's fan-service because the fanservice in this show is annoying and dreadful. Not only the fan-service is in all your face all the time but the show simply doesn't all out in the uncensored version where they showed uncensored tits...\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nLike with most Isekai anime before and since the music is very dull fantasy music that we all seen heard and it does nothing to make it special.\\n\r\nThe opening theme\u00a0DeCIDE\" by SUMMONERS 2 sung by the female main characters was a pretty all right opening theme.\\n\r\nThe ending theme\u00a0Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki by Yuu Serizawa is a pretty forgetful ending theme.\\n\r\nNow for dub vs sub.\\n\r\nThe sub is\u00a0pretty good overall as you expect however I cannot say the same thing about the dub because it's pretty shit and badly acted especially Shera who sounds like she just came out from a hentai production...\\n\r\nOverall the if you still want to watch this show stick with the sub.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nHow to not summon a Demon Lord is a perfect example of why I despise the Isekai genre as a whole.\\n\r\nThe story is awful, the pacing is terrible, the comedy is unfunny for the most part, the characters sucked and the fan-service was horrendously annoying. You're just better off watching hentai because least you can get something out of this compare to this piece of shit. Avoid this show like the plague.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

Borderline p*rn ensues, but even though he is supposed to be a big, overpowered, scary demon lord, he isthe biggest beta male when it comes to the opposite sex.

Reminds me of a faster pace of Overlord mixed in with Death March dazzled with a bit of every other trapped in a video game anime. Definitely not for everyone but I'm kinda desperate for hyped animes these days only watching MHA waiting a f**king week every week for one anime episode whileconstantly searching for good animes to watch without dropping it after the first episode. So far this anime has caught my interest and if your like anyone else who likes op anime mc'c who saves girls, then why not give it a try.",

Oh, what do you mean you're not a horny teenager anymore? and that you care about 'decency' and 'realism'? pleas be serious, if you really cared about that you would be watching some indie film or any early 00's show.\\n\\n\r\nOK so if you're not interesting (only) in the girls, I bet you're looking for some emotional psychological drama tha-HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHA nah that doesn't happen (don't worry i read the manga)\\n\\n\r\nNow with the bad parts, you remember in how SAO portraits every character that doesn't LOVE Kirito as a creepy psycho maniac? well..... ok that would be spoilers, just be prepared for some Akane Ghoul next level of edge here. \\n\\n\r\nWell I think oh what saves the show of being \"DUh next SAO 1/10 worst show evah\" is the main guy. No surprisingly no joking here, i was expecting some other self insert Kirito Magge, but no.

I just don\u2019t get that satisfying BOOSTO anymore, if you know what I mean\u2026anyway, Demon Lord on the other hand is actually pretty good for what it is, and I\u2019m here to tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is this show an ecchi, but it\u2019s an isekai anime as well, because we definitely don\u2019t have enough of those! And you can tell that creators are running out of fresh isekai ideas, because this anime\u2019s first episode alone stole so many things from other isekai anime that I\u2019m not actually sure whether it was intentional or not. You got references to KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Overlord, and so many others. I actually found this to be rather ridiculous, yet quite amusing. And we now arrive at one of the primary reasons as to why I like this anime: it\u2019s actually pretty funny! Now I know that taste in comedy varies from person to person, but for me, the lewd humor and Diablo\u2019s plain awkwardness were relatively enjoyable to watch. I found myself laughing during every episode, which for me was just refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the question that I\u2019m sure is the most important to you: are the ecchi aspects of this show any good? Well, I can happily tell you that they most certainly are. You got the bouncy boobs, slimes that melt clothes, naked in bed scenes, fondling of breasts, and so much more. In fact, there\u2019s a really memorable scene in episode 10 (If you\u2019ve watched it, you know what I\u2019m talking about ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ), that goes to borderline hentai levels of lewdness. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I really dig that.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two primary girls in this anime. Shera is a large chested, blonde elf princess with sparkling eyes who likes to rub her breasts up against the protagonist. Yep, we got a winner here! Though she\u2019s actually not a one dimensional character like you might expect her to be, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying her story arc, despite its simplicity. Rem is a flat chested animal girl with long, charcoal hair, fluffy cat ears, and a petite body. Right off the bat viewers are presented with Rem\u2019s tragic secret, and I honestly started feeling an emotional attachment to her from there on out. Also, thanks to this anime and Re:Zero, I discovered that characters named Rem are doomed to unjust torment. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but just know that being named Rem is suffering. The differences between these two characters\u2019 physical traits are like night and day, and they\u2019re each obviously designed to appeal to different fetishes. But you know what? I ended up appreciating both of these girls, and not just for their features, but for their character depth as well.\\n\\n\r\nDiablo is your typical overpowered isekai protagonist who crushes all opposition. However, unlike Kirito and his army of clones, the writers gave this guy some personality which made him enjoyable to watch. Diablo\u2019s socially awkward nature combined with his attempts to role play as a demon lord resulted in some pretty comedic moments. And viewers even get a glimpse into his past to see why he is the way he is, which helped increase his relatability for me. But let\u2019s not forget his most important trait: he\u2019s a total chick magnet! All of the girls love him, and he\u2019s wise enough to understand the merits of both large and flat chests. What a prophet. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved how this anime handled the Demon Lord Glebsklem. Instead of just making her into a giant final boss monster for Diablo to dispatch of with his hax protagonist powers, after her theatrical summoning, she was revealed to just be a kawaii loli with twintails. And she freaking loves biscuits. Plus she wants to go on a quest to consume all of the world\u2019s biscuits. I can\u2019t express in words how freaking amazing I find this to be. My only problem is that biscuit loli wasn\u2019t introduced earlier in the anime so that she could get more lewd sce- uh, I mean character development. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals are generally quite standard, though they do one up similar shows in several regards. For one, they actually have some pretty great monster designs, with the hydra being the standout one for me. Sure, it wasn\u2019t around for long, but it looked great and had fluid movements, which is a stark contrast to the poorly constructed and uninspired monsters from other isekai anime. Also, the visual quality improved dramatically during some of the ecchi scenes, which are OBVIOUSLY the most important moments in the anime. During these sacred moments, the girls got animated in very seductive ways that FIRMLY GRASPED my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe instrumental portions of each of the two theme songs played what I thought to be really catchy melodies. The songs\u2019 vocalists had a nice cute sound to them, probably because they were performed by the show\u2019s female seiyuu. The voice acting is about what you would expect. Diablo talks in a deep, menacing voice, but sounds a lot less intimidating when viewers hear his thoughts. Rem has that cute, soft voice that I simply adore, and Shera has a higher pitch, ditsy sort of voice that sounds adorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show isn\u2019t even close to top tier when compared to all other anime, it does manage to be one of the finest isekai anime that I\u2019ve seen, as well as the best ecchi anime that I\u2019ve watched in awhile. Where it excelled at for me was its sheer entertainment value. There was never a dull moment in the anime, and I both laughed at the comedic antics and felt for the characters during the more serious moments. The anime flows quite well, and it\u2019s a perfect concoction of ecchi and story elements. All I can do now is hope that future installments in both the ecchi and isekai genres follow a similar path to How not to Summon a Demon Lord.",

With no weight given to it, because there isn't even anything with the appearance of remorse or growth by the MC and the apparent lack of effect(other then to GAIN her trust) from the supporting character.

            "content": "Anime series that solely exists for the boobs, butts and fanservice?\r\nWhat type of a pathetic person would even watch such a thing?\r\nNot me at least.\r\n \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\r\n*I saw the uncensored version, this review is aimed for adult audience only, just like the anime.*\r\nEver since Sword Art Online landed, the anime industry has been trying their hardest to do clones of it. Clones which go beyond all the things that made SAO an ironic masterpiece. When Death March aired few seasons back, I thought no one would dare to take any more ridiculous self-insert isekai harem route. Apparently, the exact opposite happened, and Isekai Maou toShoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (How Not to Summon a Demon Lord) was released. Show so ridiculously awesome its English name had to be changed just so people wouldn't think it's a hentai series\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThere is this self-insert dude who has apparently never even spoken with a real person in their life, but he is really good at being isekai Jesus in this video game that everyone plays. A legend, a hero, everything person can achieve in a game and more, that's his role. Just so happens to be, these 2 girls do forbidden magic and summon the Jesus behind the game avatar to fill his in-game character. This start an epic adventure focusing around many plot related factors such as kissing, boob fondling and various sexual remarks. \\n\\n\r\nIt would be easy to mistake the series to have a loosely written story because of its settings. But that's just an assumption by those who do not know better! The writer constantly challenges his writing skills by cornering the story with wits never seen before in the animated medium. For one, during this one inn scene, our trio got a room with only one small bed. Isn't it impossible for 3 people to sleep on such a small bed? Ikr, but no! Our author found a way to get everyone well-rested, and even had the time to suck neko girl's ears, making her happy, followed by a 1,5 minute long boob fondling scene. Every situation that looks beyond hopeless, gets eventually turned positive in ways you would never expect (unless you expect them to be related to lust, in which case you will not be surprised).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with Strike the Blood was the amount of girls it had for the viewer to choose from. Who is the best girl and who the canon pairing. These were questions that made watching it almost stressful due to the meat quantity. Decisions, decisions. Masosoma has fixed these huge problems in two ways. a) there are only 2 girls that matter and all the others are just noncanon pairing hoes b) you don't need to choose as you can have them both. \\n\\n\r\nShera is the perfect Elf girl and looks exactly the same as blonde from Sukebe Elf no Mori e. Moreover, she has huge boobs. Rem is where lolicon fetish meets S&M bondage. But really, she has animal ears, so naturally, owning a huge metal collar is just an essential part of her design and not a questionable choice the least. Her eye color is also green which is the only color that really matters. Unfortunately they don't seem to have personalities, but I am certain both of them are especially good at sucking... things. . \\n\\n\r\nOur Kirito is called Diablo this time. He is also voiced by Ono Saisuke v.2.0, so you know he is awesome. By awesome, I mean a total loser, but still gets to live the ideal life of a lawful wish fulfillment swagnator, and has the most alpha voice imaginable. Other than his hands, which seem to have endless stamina when it comes to harassing women, his other best merit is anything he ever let's out of his mouth. When he called that nerdy mage a mega pleb, I removed all characters from my favorite lists just because none of them has as long of an e-penis, and when he gave his monologue praising both: small and big boobs, I had no choice but to make \"Big boobs fill man's hand, small boobs fill man's heart.\" my new favorite philosophical quote. \\n\\n\r\nProduction:\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, according to my calculations, the series has offered us around 27 scenes that have moved the plot onward with audiovisual story telling (pantsu shots, bakaboats, pointy nipples etc.). That's all really cool. Outside the things that matter, the art and animation are based medium quality. The boob bouncing, especially during walking scenes, is animated in an extremely fluid manner, and goes in perfect harmony with the bouncy sounds, making the series almost hypnotic for that matter. \\n\\n\r\nFinal judgement. Censored version 1/10. Uncensored version 10/10. Should be watched by anyone who thought Sutobura saved anime there were Kill la Kill failed.",

            "content": "Here we have another isekai-harem LN adaptation, as is though shared with many similar series of the kind, and this season alone, This is the ONLY Isekai LN adaptation that you should watch this season (and going forward) as it's largely competent on the likes of Overlord (similar but different)?\r\nAnd also, just go for the uncensored version of the anime, that always helps if you love insane amounts of fanservice with boobage, ecchi shots and whatnot! You can thank me later.\r\nStory:\r\nHere we go again...yet another \"transported into another world\" (more like self-inserted) fantasy series of some random dude who managed to beat the game, knowits innards, specs and whatnot, and then suddenly finding himself IN the actual game! With a bunch of girls that are reverse-magical slaved and self-locked into our MC with boob touches and physics, follow the Demon King Diablo on his every step of the way, going towns, encountering allies and enemies, showing off his OP skills and \"tactics\" every so often while finding a solution to rid those chains! And who doesn't want to watch a perverted MC have his subconscious way with \"hit-and-miss\" intentions of the harem?\\n\\n\r\nThe only difference in Isekai Maou: there's actual progressive story and subversion plot points that are oh-so-predictable yet satisfying to watch. It's like you're watching an actual playthrough of the game itself! You probably thought that the usual Isekai clich\u00e9 troupes will work against it, but nope! With decent execution, and the overtime boringness that sets in (your tastes vary, I'm not gonna judge), at least it manages to keep the investment level of the series high like the Almighty, and best of all? It doesn't feel cringeworthy whatsoever, even with the forced humor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFor a cheap knock-off of the most OP character (reference to a certain Death March), Sakamoto Takuma a.k.a Summoning Master and Demon King, Diablo, is both a visual treat and a sight to behold. Other than his OP skills which have the \"woah\" factor, at least he has the audacity to act with the \"sensitivity and righteousness\" behaviour while playing the Demon King act. And for that, he gets a thumbs up for not being the (fill in the blank)-AF character like so many other mediocre series does with the archetype. Anyone who has been burnt out with Diablo's character will appreciate that he stands out in the most fitting way possible.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the girls then:\\n\r\nShera the Elf with giant boobs. What more could you want with her EVERY movement with oh-so-jiggly boobs that always make Diablo cringe at the thought of it? More or less, all the subversive moments of squeezing boobs just makes it more worthwhile to watch this far none.\\n\r\nRem the flat-chested Neko. As if someone with large boobs isn't enough, how about one with a flat chest, but also \"smooth to the touch\" that makes you wanna cringe so hard? Not to mention, her lolicon look and the cat-fested ears just made it so that she could orgasm at the sight of sucking and caressing her gentle ears with hot blemishes!\\n\r\nKlem, the TRUE Demon Lord of Cross Reverie, looks menacing at first glance, but here comes another loli girl with the love of biscuits (or most likely any satiating food HAHA), kinda liked her character for the most part, even with the eventual full-power release.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are reminiscent of the vibes that are founded by the ironic SAO-ish quirks:\\n\r\nAlicia, working for the Imperial Army, she comes off as being an aloof female warrior. At first, her attempts of working with Diablo, Shera and Rem come across as just another insert-yourself-into-the-harem clich\u00e9, but once the \"true\" Demon King is unleashed, her \"ignorance is bliss\" attitude starts showing with intensity. So much so that even the OP scenes outlined this (if you looked hard enough).\\n\\n\r\nKeera, the evil brother of Shera, the S&M specialist. No words can describe him, as per to a certain mad scientist on the other side. He is truly despicable to the point of no return. \"All I wanted for family is you\"? Yea right, you degenerate piece of shit! Every troupe here clearly exemplifies the conglomeracy of it all, with this one character.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nAjia-do Animation Works is an obscure studio that has a long history like veterans Toei Animation or Sunrise, but their repertoire of works are subpar, with the only well-received series being Pierrot's follow-up of Emma Season 2, and that was back in 2007. So if you're an anime studio nut like myself, think of this obscure studio as the equivalent of Pierrot in terms of animation quality, just mildly better.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with Isekai Maou, there is the Ajia-do trait of limited animation quality (especially with noticeable long-distance/range backgrounds), but it is vastly improved and the 2D artwork doesn't disappoint. Along with the action sequences, it doesn't give off the feel that the producers cheaped out on both the art and animation. To quote an example, check out the catchy OP sequence where Shera's giant \"knockers\" boobs slap each other for an insane 2 second-cut (near the chorus part). Now that is attention to detail. Overall, good art and animation, and props to the production staff.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe OST is one of the tolerable ones this season: An all-star female VA casting for the OP and Yuu Serizawa with the help of HoneyWorks' CHiCO for the ED. Just knowing that the veteran seiyuus all sound so good, you can't help but to be immersed in the OST. From the battle scenes that are full or intensity to the action that keeps pumping non-stop, honestly I enjoyed myself with all that is to offer here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Isekai Maou is a series that at least does the tri-factor (Isekai, LN-harem, ecchi) genres some justice, and with the original source material comes criticisms that many people will pass off as some unnecessary filler. But to be quite honest, while I don't love this anime, the enjoyment factor is really where it's at to see these characters mingle with a story that's so stupid, it's entertaining much. To the haters, at least give this a second chance or something, I promise you, it's not as taxing as many mediocre isekai series out there.",

            "content": "Ever wanted to know what it feels like to own someone? I\u2019m not talking about people who you hire or a business partner. I\u2019m talking about if you actually hold ownership of someone like a slave. Taking on the role of a protagonist in a fantasy world is no easy task. Even for a guy like Sakamoto Takuma, he may be an experienced gamer but he\u2019s never been equipped to deal with a life changing event such as being transported into the very game he played. After becoming \u201cDiablo\u201d, he learns that the hard way.\r\nIsekai Maou no Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu (otherwise known asHow Not to Summon a Demon Lord) is exactly what it looks like \u2013 a show about a demon lord who gets summoned into this fantasy world. The juicy part of the show is that the main protagonist possesses a \u201cslave-turning\u201d skill that allows him to enslave others. True to its form, this anime sets off so many damn red flags that it became of those cases of being so bad, it\u2019s almost good.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to lie. This show glorifies fan service at any chances it gets so be prepared for a whole feast of them. The first few episodes makes it clear that the two main girls \u2013 Shera and Rem serves as Ms. Fanservice. It doesn\u2019t help with the fact that around their neck are collars standing as proof of their enslavement status. As a guy with poor social skills, Diablo have trouble building a connection with his two slaves at first. My early impression of Diablo is that he is a joke of himself. Being a Demon Lord with such power is like an unholy gift but he doesn\u2019t truly know what to do with it. Furthermore, Shera and Rem doesn\u2019t know anything about him and vice versa. However, it does show that Shera adores Diablo and is \u201cimpressed\u201d by his skills. Then, there\u2019s Rem who shows little respect to Diablo at first but does warm up to him as they get to know each other more. In a stereotypical manner, they grow closer together and seems the two main girls even develop feelings toward their master. Yet, Diablo still has to hold his urges of lust whenever he gets caught into compromised positions. If you\u2019ve seen any Isekai series of similar nature, you\u2019ll know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nAs I watched more and more of this anime, it seems the show does take on a more emotional side once it decided to focus more on the characters. Despite his poor social skills, Diablo shows a genuine caring side towards his two slaves. This is shown in later episodes when he decides to risk everything to save Shera. He even begins to enjoy his new life as a Demon Lord and make the best of it without jeopardizing others. His main goal transform from ruling the world to being a trustworthy master to his slaves. By nature, it\u2019s a peculiar sense to develop a character but somewhat works this way because of Diablo\u2019s personality. He\u2019s a haughty guy with a lot of pride on his side but sometimes drops his guard when it involves his two slaves. On the other hand, I think it\u2019s a cheap ploy by the creators to get the audience to like Diablo. Because let\u2019s face it, Diablo is still a generic character that adheres to wish fulfillment fantasies. So many isekai series pulls this trick from the book and it\u2019s impossible to overlook this show\u2019s pitfalls.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I also have to proclaim that it\u2019s very easy to overlook the other characters outside of the main trio. We got characters like the Fallen (Demonic Being) Edelgard making her debut early on. Does anyone actually care about this character? She speaks broken sentences and plays more of the role of a combatant. Oh and I can\u2019t forget how absurd her personality changes from time to time depending on who she faces with. Other characters like Sylvie and Alicia represents archetypes like the guild master and honorable knight you can find in almost any video game. And of course, they had to add Glebsklem into the show so that the cast would be complete with a half-naked loli. That\u2019s not even the worst part. If we look at the antagonists of the series, they are what really holds the character cast back. Every villain in the show are one dimensional characters with their own self-interest and greed. Some even have other sins that pushes the line of the show\u2019s censorship. I can\u2019t fandom how these antagonists were made except perhaps to tests the limits of Diablo\u2019s powers. The obvious result is that Diablo overcomes his obstacles because how overpowered he is. It\u2019s lack of creativity 101 that hardly takes any effort for anyone to make these type of characters.\\n\\n\r\nAjia-Do worked on a variety of genres before but this is their first full TV anime adaptation based on a light novel. By technical standards, it looks vibrant and matches with what an isekai world should look like. The high fantasy elements of the magical creatures and archaic structures are within expectation. Plus, some of the action scenes carries sufficient details to prove what Diablo is capable of. However, be aware of the show\u2019s fan service. In some episodes, it really pushes the envelope with the \u201caction\u201d. Scenes that includes fingering, sexual power restoration, and tentacles made this anime look like a cartoony porn. It\u2019s also impossible to not take eyes off of Shera\u2019s body. The camera plays around her breasts like they have a life of its own. Clothes are also blown off constantly for specific \u201creasons\u201d that puts Rem to shame. Character expressions often include their screams of passion in moments of ecstasy. Thanks to the talents of the VA, they make those scenes look more lascivious than they should.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an unwritten rule where people drop episodes for a show after three episodes or less. For Isekai Maou, it will most likely take one. It\u2019s a break or take for first impression and if you\u2019re coming in with low expectations, then do yourself a favor and hit that drop button. If you make it beyond those passionate screams of our slave girls, then this may be a sexy rollercoaster. The main trio of Diablo, Shera, and Rem carries this anime so get used to that. Does that still make this anime an enjoyable experience in the end? Hell no.",

And this is one that I like a lot. The MC has been socially disconnected his entire life and has to interact with other NPCs(?) using his game persona. This leads to funny moments and surprisingly cool reactions that aren't standard for typical lead male roles (don't get me wrong there are moments like those in this).\r\nIt really is the MC that determines if the show is good or not.\r\nOn its surface, this is simply another power fantasywhere a socially inept hikikomori ends up in a game world somehow, where he is completely OP. Overlord, Log Horizon, and others do the same thing so why not watch one of those?

            "content": "Summer 2018 had been a ride of an anime this year. From the unexpected Season 3 of Overlord, the return of a massive anime Attack On Titan, to the anime where summer is all about the fun as well as isekai shows that needed to be judged alot. This summer, we have plenty of isekai to judge on and one of them is \"How Not To Summon A Demon Lord.\" where at first it looks like it is another isekai trash with uncapable of a protagonist, although at least it is not like that. Also, for some reasons, I call this show a lite versionof Overlord. Lets found out why.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe anime starts off with your typical MC being so overpowered ingame that I don't even know how many times this scene was repeated on other isekai genre shows. Anyways, overpowered MC got transported to a fantasy world which is base on the game he amounted his life on instead of getting a college degree and get a job. Then his eyes caught upon two girls. An Elf and a Beast (cat?) girl. The girls thought that they summon a beast and that beast will be their \"slave\" (pet), but it turns out the magic is reflected to the two girls becoming them the slaves of op protagonists named Diablo. There, it starts all the threesome harem that every audience will expect on this show and the conflicts of having a slave that have internal conflicts.\\n\r\nMany people call this anime a lite version of Overlord because unlike many isekai shows, in Overlord and on this anime, the protagonist has an objective and personality, both we can see while we are watching. We get to know their interests as well as their uninterests on certain things. Though, this anime and Overlord share good protagonists, the harem and fanservice is still a nuisance to the story of this anime (although its pretty much ok). Unlike in Overlord where there's no fanservice and harem, it focuses more on how the protagonist will conquer the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nVisuals will always be important on a show where harem and fanservice is part of the story. I mean, the whole purpose of fanservice.. is fan.. service... On visual terms, How Not To Summon A Demon Lord is an okay show for it. Its not that bad as well as not that good. The details of the spells are done nicely, as well as the environment, monsters and character outlines. Not to mention, the visuals of the OP and ED matches the show quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI, to be honest, not the fan of the OP and ED of the show. I always skip it although it doesn't say its really bad for my taste. It is just not my type of music. However, the background music where the anime runs is quite good. It matches scenes where either a battle is going on, or whether the two girls Rem and Shera cling on Diablo naked and Diablo overreacting on his mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNow here is the interesting part of the anime. Characters. I mentioned earlier how the main protagonist is similar to the Overlord protagonist where both shows personality that pick our interest to watch the show every week. I'll now talk about the other characters especially the two girls Rem and Shera. What I like about this two girls is that they are also not your typical harem girls to the protagonist. They also have traits and importance to the story that if they are not present, the story will not progress at all. Shera being a very important person to a nation becoming a slave is already a one big conflict to everyone and Diablo. Then Rem holding one of the most hidden secrets across the world that only Diablo and the high mage named Celestine knows. Then we are provided by supporting characters that not only shows the might of Diablo but his willingness to protect these two girls. The fights shows how he is willing to sacrifice himself to the girls knowing some battles are pretty hard for him but he always win anyways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIsekai shows are not really that enjoyable as they are repeated always. Fanservice is always irritating and the story lacks elements that a story needs to be. However, this show, having a good protagonist, makes the story progress in the right path for the setting of the story. Making it automatically enjoyable for me to watch and making me wait for a week for an another episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \"How Not To Summon A Demon Lord.\" is like an upgraded version of your always typical isekai with harem and fanservice cliche that you always want. It's a good isekai to watch on unlike many others that have MC that is boring and have a pointless harem.",

            "content": "If I had a choice to kill off a genre it would be Isekai. Out of all the anime genres, the Isekai genre seemed to be the one to annoy me to end due to how poorly written and pandering most of the shows of the Isekai genre are. Say all you want about ecchi + harems but least they are for the most part dump fun shows that respect its own target audience not to mention most of the ecchi + harems anime are self-aware of how cheesy and for the most part bad they are. However, this self-awareness rarely happens in Iseaki asmost of the shows tried to be more epic and seriously than they are actually are and most of the shows end up failed due to poor writing and direction.\\n\\n\r\nHow to not summon a demon Lord is no different in fact it's one of the worse Isekai anime I have seen period. While it isn't as offensive as The Master of Ragnarok and Blesser of Einherjar and In a Another World With my Smartphone it's still is a pretty awful anime with hardly any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Now with that said let's dive in into the Isekai rabbit hole.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a Hikikomori gamer named Takuma Sakamoto who is mysteriously transported to the world of his favourite MMORPG, Cross Reverie, with the appearance of his own character in the game, the Demon Lord Diablo. The two young girls who summoned him, the pantherian Rem and the elf Shera, attempt to use a spell to make Takuma their servant, but due to his passive \"Magic Reflection\" ability, the spell rebounds, and both end up with magic collars stuck on their necks, thus becoming his slaves instead. With a serious case of social anxiety, Takuma decides to act like his character while interacting with others, and makes use of his high stats and vast knowledge of Cross Reverie's lore to survive in his new environment, travelling along with Rem and Shera to look for a way to remove their slave collars while helping them with their own, personal issues that led them to summon him in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nJust with like with every bad Isekai anime the story of How to Not Summon a Demon Lord is non existent at best mainly because instead of telling a story that has a purpose this crap feast decided to be another crappy isekai story that is filled with fan-service and contrived characters arcs that serve no purpose other to show how overpowered the main character while the females act like damsel in distresses.\\n\r\nThe story, for the most part, is terribly paced as the fan-service as well the action scenes seemed to drag on way longer than they should. The writing of the show ranges from below average at best to absolutely terrible at worst as the show constantly likes to pander to the lowest common denominator of anime fans.\\n\r\nIt's doesn't help that the comedy in this show is pretty damm bad as not only the jokes got annoying as the series progressed but the comedy itself is unfunny and lame for the most part.\\n\r\nThe final nail of the coffin for the story is that this show at various times took itself way too seriously for it's good. This was present in the second half of the series where the show was trying to more epic than it actually is and because of that the show became pretty pretentious at various moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is awful.\\n\r\n1/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters aren't much better as they all boring and uninspired walking cliches.\\n\\n\r\nDiaibo is a typical overpowered protagonist that we all seen before and just like many overpowered protagonist that came before him his is bland and uninteresting. However, I will give Diabio this unlike other overpowered characters he can be a bit funny at times but at the same time he's jokes can be pretty repetitive and annoying.\\n\r\nThe two female characters that follow Diaibo are nothing but fetish husk bait for the viewer. Both are not worth mentioning at all because they do is ride either in the protagonist dick or act like damsel in distress in certain points in the series so that overpowered kun can save them.\\n\r\nThe same thing can apply for the rest of the female characters in this show.\\n\r\nAs for the villains they are all SAO levels of bad as all of them are evil for the sake of being evil. Hell one of the villains in the middle of the series looks like a bootleg Sugou from the Althem arc of Sword Art Online.\\n\r\nOverall like with the story the characters in How to Not Summon a Demon Lord are awful.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nIf there was one thing that I consider to be good about this shit show that it would be the visuals.\\n\r\nThe show is pretty to look at as it's filled with great use of vibrant colours for the character designs as well the background scenery.\\n\r\nThe actual animation is pretty solid overall that is decently smooth and the fights have pretty decent fight choreography.\\n\r\nWhile the visuals were pretty good I have one complainant with the visuals that certain characters are way too oversexualized. While it's as bad not as The Master Of Rock Bottom where the all of the female characters inducing young children are oversexualized for no reason it's still just an unpleasant sight to see characters that have young looking bodies doing sexual acts on screen.\\n\r\nOne more thing I can complain about the visuals is how the show used it's fan-service because the fanservice in this show is annoying and dreadful. Not only the fan-service is in all your face all the time but the show simply doesn't all out in the uncensored version where they showed uncensored tits...\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nLike with most Isekai anime before and since the music is very dull fantasy music that we all seen heard and it does nothing to make it special.\\n\r\nThe opening theme\u00a0DeCIDE\" by SUMMONERS 2 sung by the female main characters was a pretty all right opening theme.\\n\r\nThe ending theme\u00a0Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki by Yuu Serizawa is a pretty forgetful ending theme.\\n\r\nNow for dub vs sub.\\n\r\nThe sub is\u00a0pretty good overall as you expect however I cannot say the same thing about the dub because it's pretty shit and badly acted especially Shera who sounds like she just came out from a hentai production...\\n\r\nOverall the if you still want to watch this show stick with the sub.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nHow to not summon a Demon Lord is a perfect example of why I despise the Isekai genre as a whole.\\n\r\nThe story is awful, the pacing is terrible, the comedy is unfunny for the most part, the characters sucked and the fan-service was horrendously annoying. You're just better off watching hentai because least you can get something out of this compare to this piece of shit. Avoid this show like the plague.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 2/10",

Reminds me of a faster pace of Overlord mixed in with Death March dazzled with a bit of every other trapped in a video game anime. Definitely not for everyone but I'm kinda desperate for hyped animes these days only watching MHA waiting a f**king week every week for one anime episode whileconstantly searching for good animes to watch without dropping it after the first episode. So far this anime has caught my interest and if your like anyone else who likes op anime mc'c who saves girls, then why not give it a try.",

            "content": "How not to Summon a Demon Lord is a near textbook example of how to properly execute an ecchi anime. And let me tell you, it\u2019s about freaking time. Call me perverted if you will, but sometimes I just want to sit in a secluded location and listen to 2D girls moan in pleasure as they\u2019re put in ridiculously lewd and comical situations. Of course, I\u2019m not so shallow as to completely disregard all other aspects of an anime and call it \u201cda best evah!\u201d just because it has a few cute babes and sexy scenes. The characters have to be bearable to watch and,now I know I\u2019m asking a lot here, an ecchi anime with a decent plot wouldn\u2019t hurt, right? Unfortunately, modern ecchi anime just haven\u2019t been cutting it for me for a variety of reasons. I just don\u2019t get that satisfying BOOSTO anymore, if you know what I mean\u2026anyway, Demon Lord on the other hand is actually pretty good for what it is, and I\u2019m here to tell you why.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is this show an ecchi, but it\u2019s an isekai anime as well, because we definitely don\u2019t have enough of those! And you can tell that creators are running out of fresh isekai ideas, because this anime\u2019s first episode alone stole so many things from other isekai anime that I\u2019m not actually sure whether it was intentional or not. You got references to KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Overlord, and so many others. I actually found this to be rather ridiculous, yet quite amusing. And we now arrive at one of the primary reasons as to why I like this anime: it\u2019s actually pretty funny! Now I know that taste in comedy varies from person to person, but for me, the lewd humor and Diablo\u2019s plain awkwardness were relatively enjoyable to watch. I found myself laughing during every episode, which for me was just refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the question that I\u2019m sure is the most important to you: are the ecchi aspects of this show any good? Well, I can happily tell you that they most certainly are. You got the bouncy boobs, slimes that melt clothes, naked in bed scenes, fondling of breasts, and so much more. In fact, there\u2019s a really memorable scene in episode 10 (If you\u2019ve watched it, you know what I\u2019m talking about ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ), that goes to borderline hentai levels of lewdness. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I really dig that.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two primary girls in this anime. Shera is a large chested, blonde elf princess with sparkling eyes who likes to rub her breasts up against the protagonist. Yep, we got a winner here! Though she\u2019s actually not a one dimensional character like you might expect her to be, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying her story arc, despite its simplicity. Rem is a flat chested animal girl with long, charcoal hair, fluffy cat ears, and a petite body. Right off the bat viewers are presented with Rem\u2019s tragic secret, and I honestly started feeling an emotional attachment to her from there on out. Also, thanks to this anime and Re:Zero, I discovered that characters named Rem are doomed to unjust torment. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but just know that being named Rem is suffering. The differences between these two characters\u2019 physical traits are like night and day, and they\u2019re each obviously designed to appeal to different fetishes. But you know what? I ended up appreciating both of these girls, and not just for their features, but for their character depth as well.\\n\\n\r\nDiablo is your typical overpowered isekai protagonist who crushes all opposition. However, unlike Kirito and his army of clones, the writers gave this guy some personality which made him enjoyable to watch. Diablo\u2019s socially awkward nature combined with his attempts to role play as a demon lord resulted in some pretty comedic moments. And viewers even get a glimpse into his past to see why he is the way he is, which helped increase his relatability for me. But let\u2019s not forget his most important trait: he\u2019s a total chick magnet! All of the girls love him, and he\u2019s wise enough to understand the merits of both large and flat chests. What a prophet. \\n\\n\r\nI also loved how this anime handled the Demon Lord Glebsklem. Instead of just making her into a giant final boss monster for Diablo to dispatch of with his hax protagonist powers, after her theatrical summoning, she was revealed to just be a kawaii loli with twintails. And she freaking loves biscuits. Plus she wants to go on a quest to consume all of the world\u2019s biscuits. I can\u2019t express in words how freaking amazing I find this to be. My only problem is that biscuit loli wasn\u2019t introduced earlier in the anime so that she could get more lewd sce- uh, I mean character development. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals are generally quite standard, though they do one up similar shows in several regards. For one, they actually have some pretty great monster designs, with the hydra being the standout one for me. Sure, it wasn\u2019t around for long, but it looked great and had fluid movements, which is a stark contrast to the poorly constructed and uninspired monsters from other isekai anime. Also, the visual quality improved dramatically during some of the ecchi scenes, which are OBVIOUSLY the most important moments in the anime. During these sacred moments, the girls got animated in very seductive ways that FIRMLY GRASPED my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe instrumental portions of each of the two theme songs played what I thought to be really catchy melodies. The songs\u2019 vocalists had a nice cute sound to them, probably because they were performed by the show\u2019s female seiyuu. The voice acting is about what you would expect. Diablo talks in a deep, menacing voice, but sounds a lot less intimidating when viewers hear his thoughts. Rem has that cute, soft voice that I simply adore, and Shera has a higher pitch, ditsy sort of voice that sounds adorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show isn\u2019t even close to top tier when compared to all other anime, it does manage to be one of the finest isekai anime that I\u2019ve seen, as well as the best ecchi anime that I\u2019ve watched in awhile. Where it excelled at for me was its sheer entertainment value. There was never a dull moment in the anime, and I both laughed at the comedic antics and felt for the characters during the more serious moments. The anime flows quite well, and it\u2019s a perfect concoction of ecchi and story elements. All I can do now is hope that future installments in both the ecchi and isekai genres follow a similar path to How not to Summon a Demon Lord.",

The general plot(rather then the other Plots) gives the promise and overall to the point I watched does deliver.\r\nThe art style is smooth and well executed, many of the choices deliver the scene and emotion with great weight.

I can not do so.\\n\\n\r\nI sat through 4 episodes however the most damning portion of this show happens in the first episode. The MC effectively rapes one of the two support characters we meet at the start. The show down plays this and as it does such I find it incredibility offensive. I ended up watching to episode 4 to see if there is any form of recognition of that, anything that would show treating it with the weight that topic deserves and found nothing to that effect. With no weight given to it, because there isn't even anything with the appearance of remorse or growth by the MC and the apparent lack of effect(other then to GAIN her trust) from the supporting character. From these I can not no respect for the studio that made this and will not finish this trashy show.",

The dialogue, the action, the discoveries, the ECCHI! I was certainly never bored. \r\nDemon Lord [title is too long] has enough story and flow to keep you from thinking this a pure fanservice anime despite the extreme ecchiness. I'm not even mad that boobs and suggestive scenes are in almost every scene. Too many boob-shots can be annoying but this anime knows how to use an entertaining story with cute girls without sacrificing one or the other. \r\nOur Protagonist and his reaction to this newworld is ever intriguing. He's an anti-social shut-in but outwardly projects as an arrogant and cunning Lord. He's not ignorant or stupid and his knowledge doesn't seem misplaced as is with most Isekai anime. \\n\r\nOnly 4 episodes in and I'm already hooked. Now just to wait and see if Ajia-Do continues to produce more enthralling episodes.",

            "content": "A low score for most probably the wrong reasons.\r\nThis anime is 100% not a masterpiece. It does not delve into a deep political setting, it does not bring some never seen before plot, and it certainly does not create some complex characters that will remain with you for the rest of your life. No, but it gives life to ideals without crossing the border between logic and stupidity. It does not try to force everything unto you, it does not stick to the same old rules where ideals need to be manifested as extremities. This anime has some sort of balance in the world ofwish fulfillment. It gives what you expect it to give but not in a retarded manner where you get bored. Another plus is that it manages to give reasonable reactions to different situations for all characters. \\n\r\nUnless you have undertook some classes in cinematography and feel that unless it's a contender for the golden globe award it's a waste of time, try to view this anime as a desert type. You certainly will not be extremely impressed but you will smile when you will think about the characters behavior and interaction. \\n\r\nThat being said, I will not start to describe the plot, as this one actually does one of the best things possible for an anime that would certainly not receive a second season, it brings closure. So you will not need to feel like something is missing when you finish it. \\n\r\nIn terms of scores : \\n\r\nStory - 8.5 . Frankly I enjoyed way more than I expected. No matter how cliche it was sometimes. \\n\r\nArt - 9. The animation felt nice, and I'm not the type to look for bad frames or whine about the lack of movement in some scenes. For me it was extremely enjoyable especially when it came to battles. \\n\r\nSound - 9. Not the best, but well, not going to complain that much. I enjoyed the picked seyuu's and the op/ed choice was also spot on. \\n\r\nCharacters - 7. I'm not planning on erasing all mistakes and pretend that this anime was that good. The characters are more or less pathetic excuses of the cliche archetypes we got used to in many other like Zero no Tsukaima. But now you may say that 7 does not represent such a low score. There is a reason for this. Compared to other anime where the moments of lucidity are extremely scarce, in this one the characters felt tangible and realistic more than once or twice. Because of this I can't complain. \\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9. High as hell for another recycled Isekai. But this one for me felt fresh. Don't know why and I won't care enough to delve into this. It just felt good. \\n\r\nOverall - 9. Kill me, 9 for this seems way too high, once again, I know. But I enjoyed it a lot and felt that everything was placed nicely. There are some things that I detest which would make me give it a 8 if I ponder a little more. Yet, I believe I will watch it again and still feel it is enjoyable. This makes me appreciate it as more than the one watch type. Take this review with a little salt on the side and decide for yourself how good or bad it was. \\n",

But there are many other options if you like ecchi anime with good stories, such as Kill la Kill and Shokugeki to name some famous ones. I understand that sometimes we just feel like watching a 'shit' anime to take a break or have a switch of pace, but even then, this series just hurts your brain.\r\n How to Not Summon a Demon Lord has to be the most unoriginal series of the year. It follows a protagonist who was a NEET, and somehow for unexplained reason he endedup as his game character in another world. By the way he is OP character which no one can go against. Sounds familiar?\\n\\n\r\n There's not much to say about the story. It is pretty boring in general and really lacks sophistication. I know this is not supposed to be a 'good show', but even then it didn't have any unique element that even some shitty shows has. \\n\\n\r\n Time for tiny spoilers just for this paragraph:\\n\r\nThe ending was shit. The lead up to the ending was shit. Super cliche or should I say it was not? Surely at the end of ep11 I thought they wouldn't magically save Rem and make the antagonist a 'good guy' at the end but hey, they did. Quite cringy.\\n\\n\r\n The characters... I did not like that much\\n\r\nTypical juxtaposition between big boob oblivious girl and a flat, but more intelligent (mature?) girl. The antagonists weren't that intriguing probably due to the artstyle. Also there's too many lolis which was just cringe yet again. Of course the demon lord is a loli. \\n\\n\r\n Art.. is actually alright?\\n\r\nIf you're watching this for fan service, then you'll like it as it provides just with that pretty well. The animation is quite fluid in those scenes but generally speaking, it's pretty average. I wouldn't necessarily say it's bad but it's typical.\\n\\n\r\n So overall, I feel like I am a fool for writing this rant.\\n\\n\r\n All the cliche setting and story in this anime somehow feels like it's done on purpose just to piss me off and write this review. \\n\\n\r\n But what if this series was supposed to be a joke? At the end, I felt like this series was supposed to be a message to the ever popular isekai genre that was getting criticised for its originality, and purposely implemented all the cliche scenes just to show how general this genre can be.\\n\\n\r\n If that's the case, well done I suppose.",

            "content": "I was skeptic about this show when I saw it announced. It struck me as another generic isekai harem show with a social inept main character. I was right for the most part, but there is one thing that I forgot with my prejudice. And that is that generic shows still can be okay. At it\u2019s core How not to summon a demon lord is comparable to Overlord. But with 300% more fanservice.(Hell they had to make a censored & uncensored version, I watched the uncensored for your interest) So you already know what you\u2019re getting into, if  you don't know what I'm talkingabout, then let\u2019s just say a whole lot of assets and bounciness.\\n\\n\r\nImagine this, you\u2019re a social inept NEET who spends all his time playing vidya, only to one day be summoned to another world. You can\u2019t expect your speech skill to help you out here so what do you do? That\u2019s the case for our main character, better known as Diablo who after being summoned by two cute girls decides to put on an act of demon lord just so that he could talk to them. Luckily for him, what he lacks in the art of the tongue is made up for by pure awesomeness. By being OP as fuck and shredding everything in his way. All the while maintaining his relationships with the other two heroines: Shera a \u201cblessed\u201d elf with the IQ of a chestnut and Rem, a pantherian or as we know it. A Neko-Musume. Together with this party he explores the world based on his favorite game \u201cCross-Reverie\u201d while helping each heroine with their problems.  \\n\\n\r\nAs most isekai anime go, there is not really a plot. Instead we get a slice of life-ish structure with every episode focusing on either a part of the world or a problem that the heroines/side characters are struggling with. This does get rather predictable, if we\u2019re introduced to a new character then there is a high chance that that episode will focus on said character. The plot also incorporates some world building, just to make the world more believable, which I like. The plot does lack direction, what is Diablo\u2019s purpose in this world? Why is he here? It\u2019s the same, major isekai flaws that haunts the genre. Which is rather sad to be honest. As after so many Isekai's none have ever tried to explain these questions.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, the main character Diablo is a social inept guy, but that ain\u2019t a problem as his insecurity about his social skills is funny as fuck (and sometimes painfully relatable) Furthermore the dude is reliable, and even with his anxious personality really pulls through when it counts. He\u2019s also great in the ecchi situations with most of the show\u2019s comedic value coming from his internal monologues and how he can\u2019t handle the thickness of Shera, and Rem\u2019s flat chestedness. The heroines are portrayed in such a way that we can see that the writers tried to add depth to the characters. But trying isn\u2019t the same as succeeding, the characters still are rather on the tame side. Shera is a dumb elf, with a carefree attitude and caring behavior. While Rem is a semi-tsundere. Their relationship is just what you expect, on friendly terms with some sparks here and there, but nothing daring. (Kinda similar to SAO in that aspect) The other cast members are nearly all plot devices, which in the long run doesn\u2019t matter as we all watch this for Diablo\u2019s fights and the fanservice anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAjia-Do, the studio managing this adaptation is a minor studio. So I didn\u2019t really expect much of the animation, but after watching I can say that the animation is sub par. The animation that is present is smooth and all, but the studio opted to use a lot of tricks to fool movement. Or to animate less by for example take close up shots of faces. It\u2019s a bummer as the art style is polished and thus pleasant to look at, even if it isn\u2019t unique. The action scenes on the other hand are good enough. With the magic spells showing real kick behind them, which is neat in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is something this show does okay. It\u2019s not a musical powerhouse but the OST certainly isn\u2019t something that should be underestimated, it\u2019s an intense OST similar to something akin from a video game soundtrack, which is ironic as the world is based on a video game. The opening DeCIDE by SUMMONARS 2+ is honestly rather catchy. The ending theme is alright too. But not as a good as the opening. Plus, why the shackles as the ending artwork? Couldn\u2019t they give us more thick elfs instead? A man could only wish\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nNow.. after my rambling, what can I conclude? This show fills a niche for Overlord fans who want more fanservice. Which it does really well, the other thing is that it\u2019s just your generic Isekai. So if you\u2019ve watched other Isekai\u2019s you will know what to expect both plot and character wise. It\u2019s still worth watching if you like ecchi & OP main characters. But if you want something with more substance and actual plot, just watch something else. \\n",

It\u2019s not that i hate this genre, but with the amount of them coming out and doing what can only be a somewhat serviceable amount, it starts to get tiring. Isekai maou is no exception either. It follows the basic formula of some unknown protagonist in the \u201creal world\u201d being transported to a fictional land that he has some superficial connection to , in this case a game. He becomes the player character he uses, and is part of a pseudo version of the game that is a bit different, but follows the same mechanicsfor some reason. He joins or accidently enslaves two girls who summoned him, and they go on adventures. The plot isn\u2019t that complex and it follows a basic three act structure first with the introduction of the world, second with one of the girls and the elf kingdom, and finally the other girl and the church. Many steps along the way are riddled with plot contrivances and conveniences, but the characters, art/animation, voice acting and soundtrack are serviceable enough that it\u2019s not that much of a bother. \\n\r\nThis is a show that knows what demographic it\u2019s trying to sell it to and just goes for it. Maybe it\u2019s because i viewed it in that lens that i\u2019m more passive to the show so i don\u2019t find its content that offensive. In the end of the day it\u2019s a stupid show with fun moments, and short enough that it\u2019s not too overbearing.",

Other than that, there's nothing more to stay about the story other than boobs don't make for a decent story. Doesn't helpthat the story seems to move pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nIt moves so fast that you're honestly a little let down with everything. Such as, you just meet this man and all of a sudden you're telling him a secret that could get you killed while pleading for him not to leave you like he's your long lost lover? You start to dry hump this man who you met less than a week ago because you want him to choose you over the other girl because somehow, someway you're jealous of him wanting her? All this over a man who you haven't even known for a WEEK yet??? No thanks.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't bad at all. There is a difference in almost all the characters, but not much of a difference in how the females look. Almost every single one of them has a chest the size of Mt. Fuji, and if they don't, they're still dressed rather scantly. There isn't much verity in skin color ever, but I like the way they draw the monsters and the spells the most. It's pleasing to look at, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe music is okay, but it's not something that I would listen to on a daily or even a few times a week. I do have to say that for such a show, it does match rather well. The voice acting for the English Dub, however, is sub par. It could use some work, but I'm not a voice actor so I'll leave that be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nWhile some of the characters are rather interesting, it seems like instead of focusing on the character as a whole, they only focus on one or two aspects of them. May it be boobs, or her lack therefor of, him being a neet and being so anti-social that he finds it pretty cool to latch onto girls breast and doesn't even know what a nipple is? The characters need a lot of work, a lot, A LOT, of work. I'm also very tired of the idea that a princess is somehow scatterbrained and idiotic; royals are trained in both education and fighting more often than not because they are just that, a royal. The reactions are way too over the top for me.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of fixing the problem, they just stand there and look at it like they're in an art gallery. Doesn't help that the moment the guy touches them they act like they're in a hentai. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nWhen the Anime wasn't focusing on things that don't progress the plot, the show is pretty good. I can't say the same for when all they seem to think about are boobs and how much they can bounce when someone is either walking or standing still. It was enjoyable enough for me to be able to watch more than one episode, but not enough for me to feel the need to continue watching the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nWhile this Anime was a huge miss for me, that doesn't mean that it will be for someone else. If these are the things you enjoy, if this is the kind of comedy that you find funny, I say go for it. Enjoy what makes you happy. This show just wasn't for me however, and that's the thing. If I want to see large breast, I'll look down my shirt, but all joking aside I just can't stand this kind of Anime.\\n\\n\r\nI should have read more about it before watching it but I saw the art and went for it and that was my own mistake. All in all, in my honest opinion this Anime isn't too great. It isn't horrible, but it isn't great either.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I'm absolutely not a fan of the brand of fanservice this show offers, with some characters that are barely more than a pair of giant boobs, sexualized lolis and constantly-flustered protagonists who don't know how to handle women. It's all quite forced and obnoxious and the show went to the absolute heights of what can be done without making it a hentai. If you compare it to how Overlord approaches similar themes, you can see that it can be done without going overboard and derailing the core story.\r\nBut, enough of complaining, because there are things to compliment here. First, is the generalcharacterisation of the protagonist, who is transported to another world as an OP demon mage and quickly establishes himself as \"Diablo, the Demon Lord\", forcing a grim persona that hides his insecurity and lack of social skills - this part is actually quite amusing and once more, reminiscent of some fun aspects of Overlord's Momonga (just without the \"evil\" parts). Also, the protagonist quickly finds some serious challenges in this new world and is involved in some really cool fantasy battles - those are usually brief, but really fun to watch. The overall plot is also rather satisfying, even if ultimately predictable.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is still another trashy, ecchi-oriented isekai, but it's a league or two above really crappy shows such as Smartphone or Deathmarch (yeah, that one started cool, but later on...). While not especially memorable, it's worth giving a try if you want to relax with something that doesn't try to take itself seriously and unapologetically focuses on giving you easy entertainment. After all, is it not exactly the thing we're looking for with these shows?",

            "content": "Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu is another one of those trapped in another world anime with an overpowered male lead with a harm of skimpy anime girls the kids seem to love these days. But it's a better animated and directed than the most average harem fare like High School DxD so it's at least watchable. \r\nNow that the obligatory numbers are out of the way lets get to the interesting part so that the people who actually had the patience to read this dumb review get something out of it.\r\nThe anime, while otherwise being very standard has two themes thatit explores very often. First is the act of using a persona. No not the magical djinn like psychic beings from Shin Megami Tensei, persona as in the fake role people play in society. The main character is an utter wimp in real life. But in another world, he practically roleplays as the cocky \"Demon Lord\". Even though in his head he's completely incapable of functional communication. The elf girl is a busty, airhead who's cheerful all the time. While in reality she's a busty airhead who acts cheerful for the most part to forget her troubles. Meanwhile the cat girl hides a dark and mysterious past and blah blah blah. This is true for all the villains, the main support characters, and governor, a wannabe god priest etc etc. They all maintain a persona of some sorts. By the end of the show everyone's persona cracks. And through that they all become a better person, or in the case of villains they make everyone's life better by being gone.\\n\\n\r\nThe second theme, as anyone with 3000 IQ would guess, is slavery. In this series slavery is more akin to what it was during the Golden Age in our world. Slaves aren't treated badly by most but are still considered a second class citizen. However like it was in real life, multiple characters are shown to be better off as slaves. The series ends with two girls convincing a per-pubecent girl the fun things about being a slave. That really creeped me out. And that's the show. Everything else is like every other Isekai anime you've seen.",

            "content": "(Disclaimer: I guess my favorite character is technically a spoiler so beware)\r\nDemon Lord had no right to be so enjoyable. Every sign pointed to it being absolutely awful in every way. It was the perfect storm of awfulness that has plagued seasonal anime for the last five or so years since Sword Art Online popularized the isekai genre, but here we are, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord being actually pretty fun. Not great or even pretty good, but a lot of fun. Fun isn't something we think about much when we're scoring shows and putting them on our \"completed\" lists, but for somereason, Demon Lord makes me remember how fun watching anime can and should be. A lot of you may be thinking that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but I can't find any other way to describe Demon Lord's charm.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, Demon Lord doesn't do much to stand out from its fellow isekai shows, using the same bright color scheme to emphasize how it takes place in a game world, uses fairly generic fantasy creatures, etc. There's really not much to be blown away by visually in Demon Lord, which I can't imagine being a big draw for most people anyway. I mean, it's yet another isekai power-fantasy, how unique can it be visually? Something impressive is how Demon Lord somehow manages to make impressively skimpy female outfits following it up with an even skimpier outfit the next episode like they're having a competition with themselves. Not a complaint, just an observation from an interested viewer.\\n\r\nSound design is a little more impressive. There were moments that I was simply pulled into because of how solid the soundtrack was. The theme song that they use to introduce the paladin character, Saddler, was especially epic in my opinion. However, I wasn't really impressed with either the opening or the ending, though they were both fairly mediocre. The magic sound design was also pretty good, but I don't know if I can really call anything too bad after watching Fate/Apocrypha.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Krebskulm\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? The loli demon lord that loves cookies charmed me and my cold, dead heart. How could aybody hate such an adorable face?\\n\r\nThat's kind of a good segway into talking about the characters, which play a huge role in making Demon Lord so enjoyable. Individually, they really aren't very unique, but together they have such good chemistry that you have to smile every time they interact, especially the main trio. In fact, Diablo, the main character, is the reason to give Demon Lord a shot. He starts as just another shut-in (where have I seen this story before?) before getting transported into the game that he is an apparent master of. Seeing how socially inept he is on the inside, only able to pull off an arrogant and cocky attitude is a lot of fun. It blows up in his face a lot, putting him in awkward situations, primarily with women, creatures with which he is very uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nDemon Lord is just a blast. Obviously, if you want to watch a serious story unfold, Demon Lord probably isn't for you, despite the story being pretty good actually. There's really not a lot more to touch on, obviously it's kind of risque, which doesn't bother me at all, but some are really turned off by ecchi, which I understand. If you're someone in the latter group, you're definitely not going to like Demon Lord, since some scenes can be borderline hentai, so there's that. However, if you just want to watch a fun show, not a lot of depth or complexities, then Demon Lord may just be perfect for such an occasion.",

Now , another thing that was seemingly different was the presence of child porn around here cu'z in one episode Slyvie was molested by a drunk Diablo were she's a fault in the first place, there is Klebsklem who took part in what can be called by Shera as energizing Diablo.

            "content": "\"Isekai harem done right\u201d\r\nWith rising number of isekai shows in recent years and the negativity towards genre accompanying it, it's really nice to see Isekai Maou turning out so well. I'm sure many people got turned off by premise itself - even as a fan of ecchi, harems and isekais with OP protagonists I had some distance towards it. Luckily, to my surprise it\u2019s actually a really competent story, despite looking rather cheap and cliche. \r\nIn a way you get exactly what you see on the cover, but it\u2019s actually better than you expected.\r\nCharacters are basic, but at the same time it\u2019s easy tolike them, they don\u2019t annoy you with stupid decisions and actually have a reason to be a part of Diablo\u2019s harem. \\n\r\nOur self proclaimed Demon Lord is one of the most entertaining main characters I\u2019ve seen in some time. On one side we have the generally-disliked and overused loser shut-in stereotype, and on the other his roleplay of demon lord. Resulting inner monologues and attempts to keep his facade up are great comedy fuel, and at the same time his double character makes scenes of his OPness far less cringy yet still cool.\\n\\n\r\nWhile art and sound aren\u2019t anything exceptional, it\u2019s the story that I consider weakest point of this anime. There is pretty much no world building. Comparisons to the game made by Diablo are really nice, but not enough to make world feel alive and interesting. Villains and all the developments are as predictable as it gets and give this feeling of \"obligatory roadblock\" that just has to be there to don't make it SoL anime. \\n\r\nOn the bright side, our time isn\u2019t wasted by dragged out fights - author made good work cutting such artificial tension in pretty satisfying way, and instead most of challenge for protagonist comes from re-adjusting from his solo playstyle. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this title is ecchi. Personally, I don\u2019t like boob-fests and all the cheap fanservice one can usually find in random 12-episodes anime. Isekai Maou doesn\u2019t shy away from tits, but not only does it go way further than just skimpy clothes or pantyshots, it also does great job at making those scenes actually eroitc. And, again, Diablo is perfect character for role of male main in those situations.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I\u2019d say that harem aspect could be better. Sure, all girls are nice, but they aren\u2019t special enough to start waifu wars or be used in avatars/signatures (other than few men of culture, that is). It\u2019s hard for me to pinpoint what exactly they lacked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu is a really enjoyable anime that won\u2019t get recognition it deserves due to isekai hate. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'd probably put this in a category called \"I don't care, I liked it.\"\r\nOverall, it's pretty much unrepentant ecchi, so if you're easily turned off by that you're gonna want to pan it.\r\nStarting with the good, the art style and characters stand up pretty well. The art has a defined feeling to it, and the animations are pretty decent. For what they lack in some scenes with animation they make up for with good comedic timing. Small movements like a tail flick will set the tone for a scene more than any dialogue ever could. Past this, the characters don't really fit into cookie cutterharem roles. You have a lighthearted but naive elf, a serious cat demi-human who is the more competent, and others who make an appearance. That lack of archetypes like \"tsundere\" or similar recurrences allowed me to take the early show a lot more seriously than I thought was possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe story suffers from being fairly bland, in that the season centers around an issue Rem is going through. Past that, stuff just kinda happens to them without much rhyme or reason. This lack of narrative is probably what brought the show down the most. While I enjoyed the character interaction, there wasn't really a reason why they were doing anything but vague promises and \"the plot demands it\". At least Konosuba sets up the \"Demon General\" early on, and they just bumble their way into different Demon Generals they have to face. This one brings up Rem's issue, then puts it away for 8 eps until it's needed again. Past that, it resolves it pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile for me this was a personal 7, I'll put it as a six as I know I'm viewing it through some rose colored glasses. I wasn't expecting this show to grab me but it quickly became my most looked forward to show each week other than Overlord III. If you want something quick, dirty, and moderately comedic, give it a shot. I doubt a S2 will ever happen, but I would be pleasantly surprised if it did.",

And one day somehow he was summoned into another world and the laughing matter is the game he uses to play and the world he was summoned is same, in the first time I wasn't thinking much about that partbut after that I able to know that he is kind of one of the high-level player in the game he uses to play. Well, this anime has some adventure, magic and besides, I think the main character is cool so many girls fall for him which made a harem, also a slight test of ecchi and romance as well. \\n\\n\r\n  If this anime comes with the 2nd season I would love to watch that too.",

With an MC who was either a NEET, or not overly positive in life. In How not to Summon a Demon lord our MC is summoned into the game he plays where his character \"Diablo\" is severely OP and is one of the strongest characters Level wise in the game. We then find out he is summoned to this world by Cat Girl Rem, and Elven Girl Shera. However due to Diablos reflect Magic spell the enslavement ritual used to Summon Diablobackfires on Rem and Shera and they become Diablos slaves.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime Diablo finds things out about Shera and Rem and does whatever he can to help them achieve their goals in life. Along the way Diablo, Rem, and Shera make various connections with an abundance of likeable characters and the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the Art and Animation. With their most recent work being Izetta the Last Witch, I was very impressed with Studio Ajia-Do. The anime was very clean, crisp and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were some of the best of the season. I thoroughly enjoyed the BGM in the anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really enjoyable. I usually hate characters like Shera but I really liked her a lot. Diablo is actually an enjoyable MC. Him being overpowered was fantastic and then being shy around girls balanced him out to be a really great MC.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It had a good balance of comedy, action, fan service, and story spread throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a really good anime. I feel like most people should give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nShelf Worthy: I would buy the Bluray for this. 10/10",

That is not to say I dislike the show, I like it, but I still can't understand how people like this and dislike SAO. SAO is not my topic now so I'll just get into the review.\r\nThe story is not anything mindblowing, but I do not necessarily dislike it. MC gets transferred to another world, battles some monsters, saves some girls, meets a loli demon.It's not exactly linear, but more like divided into arcs. Usually, I rate any story a 7. The more plotholes and fuck ups and stupidity it has, the rating goes down.The more it impresses me, the higher the rating goes. This story didn't fuck itself up and neither did it impress me, so the story wasn't affected and I don't have any issues with it, so it's enjoyable and watchable. There's fanservice nearly at the end of every episode which may or may not appeal to you, but it was just a treat personally.\\n\\n\r\nDiablo is your OP isekai MC which everyone hates, but surprisingly everyone likes him here. I have to say he's pretty cool though, with his double personality and all. OP MCs are only a problem if they destroy the point of the show (I'm looking at you Hellsing), but he was the highlight of the show. His voice actor was very reminiscent of Ono Daisuke, but at the same time, he was able to pull off the more realistic persona, which is praiseworthy. His voice was really remarkable and I'm hoping to see him in other shows. I was surprised by the number of supporters Rem has, she was a flat loli neko, and it's easy to fool weebs with nekos. Her personality is as flat as her chest, that is until later episodes when she grows to have a slightly cold, but caring, cute side to her. Shera is the better girl, also cute and all, but she's like the cheerful one, and she has oppai. No complaints. Side lolis and loli demon lord aren't that bad either. The girls don't have striking personalities, but I mean, when did weebs ever hate cute 2D girls?\\n\\n\r\nFor a studio that I have never heard of, the art was very consistent and visually appealing. Character designs are good, with nice flashy colors, and smoothly animated fights, and all that crap. Soundtracks aren't very memorable but they're fitting of the isekai theme and I really like OST or sound effects that make you feel like you're inside the game yourself.\\n\\n\r\nAnother isekai anime has descended following the same tropes of its predecessors. Do you want to watch it? Go ahead.",

Yethere we are. The Summer season is getting underway and have a few things to say about Isekai Maou. No doubt for me and anyone else an important element will be how much of the fanservice/ecchi content works or whether it goes too far. For me it didn\u2019t go too far and I can live with this much. Fanservice isn\u2019t a terrible thing in and of itself. But whether the show is any good or not depends on the cast and the story. So far I\u2019m enjoying that aspect of it. Diablo is another overpowered character, but he\u2019s a person underneath that. And Rem certainly sells the emotional journey she\u2019s been through already with that terrifying entity sealed away inside of her.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There's not much to say about this show, as I and many others have already repeated the same criticism and made similar reviews for these Isekai shows. Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu, like any other Isekai show, consists of a main character who has been transported, or rather in this occasion, \"summoned\" into a fantasy world.\r\nIsekai Maou, like Overlord, SAO, and Log Horizon, takes place in what originally was a gaming world. The main character, who was a powerful gamer at the time, is placed in this world in his game avatar.\r\nThe story is nothing new, just another ridiculously over powered maincharacter who claims to be the \"Demon King\" or Maou- Sama. And like any other isekai MC, he has some girls that follow him through his adventures.\\n\\n\r\nMy greatest criticism to all isekai shows including this one is how little the show has to offer to the audience other than fanservice and some epic moments. No morals, no main theme, just a powerful main character who beats anyone who stands in his way. It's a show that once the audience has finished watching, is cast away and forgotten in the box of many other isekai shows. Of course, there are those rare moments when a isekai anime gets extremely popular, as aforementioned, but even they have at least one theme or lesson that can be discussed about. In other words, this show lacks depth in both its characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nIsekai Maou, although is overly cliched and lacks much depth in its story, still  retains some of the qualities that still keep it \"entertaining\". As aforementioned, Isekai Maou has an over-powered character and some nice fanservice, which are many people's guilty pleasures. So while the story or characters are not so great, it's still enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the art is decent and the sound isn't so bad although the OP song is quite forgettable. This show is a 7/10 for me so far, and subject to change.",

Every genre in every media on the planet has its priorities. Even anything in the world has its priorities. You dont hate a flashlight for not warming you when holding it.

This shows intention is to give you a boner. Thats all, goddamit. And im pretty sure that this purpose was fullfilled completely. Sure, the Story is shit, the chars suck ass and the sound and art is just average, but its just not important. Whoevery likes this show certainly doesnt do it for any of those things i just mentioned, but exclusively for scenes like episode 4, 19:37. (Yes i watched it completely) (Yes, my english skills are limited) (Yes, i like pineapples on pizza) The Show was indeed fun to watch not exclusively cause fanservice, also how stupid the writing was and on which drugs those guys were when writing scenarios for this show just because the needed booty. 10/10 would watch if youre into those things.",

Its animation is above the average of the genre, mainly the character designs.\r\nBeing a manga reader I consider it worthwhile to see this adaptation if you expect an isekai in which the protagonist is a \"villain\" learning about human relationships (because he has been a hikikomori in his previous life).\r\nDue to its genre with fan service, I recommend not to wait long and read the novel or the manga first. Finally I hope you can understand that the genre isekai and echi are complicated to enjoy today, butI think this anime can give you laughs and an entertaining moment if you dont expect so much of it.",

            "content": "Warning *****May Contain Spoilers***** (This is a 4 Episode review, I will return to do a finished review once the season has ended)\r\nMMO Fanservice!\r\nIsekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu or How Not to Summon a Demon Lord is 2018 anime created by  Ajia-Do studios which I know them best for their creation of the Vampire Hunter D movie back in 1985. I've seen that they have made quite a few new anime in the past few years but none caught my eye until this one. They have always had a bit of a ecchi comedy feel to their shows but no substance.This once caught my attention because of the light novel that the story draws from and the highly appealing animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out  explaining an a world in an MMORPG Cross Reverie, Sakamoto Takuma plays a OP character that is called a \"demon Lord\" named Diablo. We see a little insight that this kid obviously is your typical gamer nerd who has many of hours wacking away (tehe) at the keyboard to become one of the most powerful players int he whole game. \\n\r\n     He quickly wakes up to find he has woken up in a world that is Exactly like Cross Reverie, where he himself is now Diablo. Summoned by  two girls, the Patherain Rem and the Elf Shera Greenwood who wanted to use him to go on higher level adventures and possibly save Rem from the Demon Lord who is sealed inside her. No biggie. Except the enslavement spell that they used on Diablo was reversed and now they have collars around their necks. That is not even mentioning that Shera is an Elvin princess that has apparently ran away from home and is being chased down by her brother the king.\\n\r\n   Ok so I'd like to quickly address what everyone thinks when they see an mmorpg anime lately, and that is that its like Overlord.  Contrary to popular belief .Hack was the first and Sword Art Online is fairly recent as well. I wouldn't compare this show to just Overlord because to be frank, they have the similar plot of someone in the real world being thrown into a game and are op as hell. I will say that how not to Summon a Demon Lord is unique int that it has the bit of comedy and ecchi feel to it. I find it kind of refreshing in a way though because lets face it, that would be how most nerd would react in this type of world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe show of course isn't finished yet but with the high amount of comedy and fanservice I highly doubt we will a deep character development as we see in Overlord. I do think we will see the characters grow together but it will always be because something funny or ecchi happened. We already have the clear tropes so far. Diablo being a nerd pretending to be a demon lord so his social anxiety doesn't kill him. Rem is an outcasted girl because she has a monster that can kill everyone inside of her. Which has made her typically cold and serious (well that and the small tits). Shera is a stereotypical big boobed air head who is fun loving and sweet. We really haven't seen much of any major developments besides the main character so far but we will see. Although I do love the perverted guild master so far.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and animation so far have been pretty high up with the current level of modern day animation. The magic and fight scenes have so far been appealing to the eye. This doesn't even mention the colorful world they have created and unique races. \\n\\n\r\nI will finish this review once the season is completed!",

For the pure enjoyment of the story and the facial expressions that the characters give us makes this anime worth it. \r\nFor the people that get hung up to the fact that it is echii I would say this is how it is and to move on if it\u2019s not your thing. You\u2019ve seen one echii anime you have seem them all as the saying goes. Some people will like that it is echii othersnot. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this one is a gem. I like how the MC is portrayed in his home world and then just how the skills he had are transposed to the new world. And honestly I love the artist who is drawing the MC. The facial expressions make me laugh out loud. Even the way the character was written is funny. Have I said I really like this MC\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThe art work is decent, the fight scenes are good and the GOD mode of the MC is to be expected. This is only Ep 4 but I can\u2019t wait to see more. It was an anime I knew nothing about so it was a nice find for the summer season 2018.\\n\\n\r\nMy one guilty pleasure this season. I have to say that this series I had no clue what it was about. And man does it ever not disappoint when it comes to character development. It is not as complex as other series but you do get a good feel for everyone that is the main character roles. \\n\\n\r\nYou also get that all important how the main character crosses from one world to another. Something that this type of genre sometimes lack. \\n\\n\r\nDiablo is such a funny character when you consider who he truly is in one world versus another. A shut in in one world and an all-powerful true Demon Lord in another. What I love about his anime is the facial expressions of the characters and how they react to situations that they are put into. I don't want to spoil any of it but that Demon Lord has made me literally laugh out loud a few times. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes there will be haters due to the fact that the series is echii but to those I say if this is not your cup of tea then move on and Watch something else. There is plenty to watch this summer 2018 season.\\n\\n\r\nI have already re-watched this like 4-5 times thus far per episode and we are only on episode 4. Glad I decided to give this a whirl this season. Now you as a reader may not agree with what I wrote and I respect that just like I would respect anyone calling this series a piece of crap that has been rehashed a thousand different ways already. So if you read this review and think that I am completely wrong as it is not your view then it is what it is. This series was not for you. Others will enjoy it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nAs per my rating system on Mal I am scoring this very high which if you look at my scores as an average I do not do very often. I am giving this anime an 86 just for the sheer enjoyment that I am getting out of it. \\n\\n\r\n= ) \\n\\n\r\nTia\\n",

Especially if you said yes to the last three, you will enjoy watching this anime, but please do it privately. \r\nThe story isn't anything too special, and the characters aren't very dynamic. It's your classic isekai trope with the socially awkward NEET main character who gets transported into a different world with OP abilities, his entourage of pretty girls, and everybody gets surprised at how strong our MC is. The characters don't develop that much, anda lot of events that happen can only be described as 'cheesy'. However, if you're fine with that, then sit back and enjoy the feast for your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is vibrant and the music isn't bad. Fanservice is pretty much all this anime is about, and if it's something that bothers you, I seriously recommend against watching this. Animation was pretty smooth and the effects were nice. Would've liked to see more magic and fight scenes, but I guess animating boobs and cute girls is alright. In my opinion it's a shame that the efforts were focused on fanservice, but it is what it is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, story is mediocre and characters uninteresting. Art and sound were nice, and nothing special in particular. For those who plan to watch it for story and action, you will be thoroughly disappointed, and probably see it as a 2/10. If you like watching cute girls and the eyecandy, it might be more of an 8/10. To me, it wasn't painful to watch, so 6/10 will be my score.",

I then traversed several hundred kilometres south, through rugged terrain and along the way, scaled a few mountain ranges. At the heart of the alps, I met up with the master connoisseur. \r\nDespite his initial dismissive attitude towards my appearance, the master was quick to change as I revealed to him, a carefully wrapped copy of 'Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu'.\r\nAfter sitting through the approximately 300 hours of heart-warming Japanese animation, the German connoisseur smiled gleefully at Shera's massive bazonkas. A singletear made its way down his cheeks. He turned towards me, still smiling, and told me: \"zat was ze cheesiest thing anyway has ever shown me. Danke.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe cringe that exists within the show is unrivaled by any other. Its unique distastefulness and pain-inducing plot is comparable to that of people who try seriously on Tik-tok. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the agony of sitting through the trashy content is completely nullified by the amount of fan-service the show has to offer. But like any fun drug, the user will inevitably crash after a brief period of euphoria. What used to be nut busting anime bazoinkas quickly morph into a general sense of fatigue and boredom. The producers fail to realize that, despite their somewhat effective appeal to the male fantasy, a pair of huge ganzongas can't hold up a show with an enumerable amount of plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are worse isekai shows this season.\\n\\n\r\nBut why watch this when you can watch slime reincarnated?\\n\\n\r\nActually, I guess it might be viable as research material.

            "content": "For starters, the story was pretty basic. The main protagonist is a gamer that plays the MMORPG Cross Reverie. He finds himself magically turning into his high-level mage character, named Diablo, upon being summoned into the game by Rem and Shera, the two other main protagonists of the show. The rest of the show follows the trio on a journey to release a Demon Lord, trapped inside Rem, from within her without killing her. Thankfully, frequent action, humorous dialogue and visuals, and plot development (which also serves to reveal a decent amount of lore to the viewer) are all balanced well, keeping the showing fromgetting too boring too quickly. There was a fight scene nearly every episode and none of the slower moments felt like they were moving too sluggishly or were unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of the game itself is also quite uninspired, seeming simply to be a basic MMORPG featuring your run-of-the-mill adventurers, wizards, demihumans, and monsters. However, the show is beautifully animated. Everything is vibrantly colored and crisply outlined. Again, I must mention the fight scenes, as they feature some of the cleanest visuals for magic casting that I have seen in any show. The sound quality and choices are also very pleasant, making the show extremely easy and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\n A lot of people have trouble with the lewd scenes and fan-service of the show, claiming they are excessive and even going so far as labeling them as \"hentai.\" Anyone who has ever read/seen hentai will tell you that those people are wrong. How Not to Summon a Demon Lord seemingly makes fun of this common anime trope by featuring laughably over-the-top lewd moments that more or less desensitize you to the moans of pleasure and sexualized character designs through the sheer absurdity of the situations that the characters find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great if you're just looking for a funny anime with smooth, quality animation and cool fight scenes. The opening and ending are good too (I personally never skip the opening, it's just too good). \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show if you are looking for an anime to emotionally invest in or if you are easily offended by visuals that are sexually suggestive.",

After powering through all twelve episodes in one sitting I shut down the television and said \"What the fuck?\" \r\nNow I'm not going to be long winded and described all the things this title did and didn't do right, I'm not that sadistic. Besides there are plenty of other reviews that do that for you. \r\nWhat I am going to say is this, for those who enjoy skin-a-max type titles with over saturated fan service, boob grabs and nipple pinching this isthe precise title for you. It's so way over the top with it that you will need some Kleenex to clean up the spooge off of your moms couch after watching this. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who are physically and mentally above the age of fourteen, then this title will do absolutely nothing for you. Seriously, its just another ecchi isekai that you've seen time and time again and probably wish you hadn't. \\n\\n\r\nOverall...well you've got my take on it so watch if you want to or because you don't believe that this thing is choked full of raunchy, or don't. Unfortunately this is just another sorry title that Japan has once again magnanimously pumped out for the sheer money making money shots. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 1 out of 10 simply because the art and sound weren't particularly pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nCheers,\\n\\n\r\nKuro\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Isekai Maou. This show was a stinker to put plainly. It seems common to equate it to Overlord but that does Overlord such a disservice. I'm going to rail on this show pretty hard but overall if you want a fantasy story similar to Overlord to scratch that itch then its worth a watch. As a standalone show however it falls short in so many ways.\r\nThe story starts off with a gamer shut in transported to this new world. He keeps the items he had in the game, one item is a ring of spell reflection. Thisearns him the busty elf and small chested cat girl as his slaves. Now he must learn about the world, carefully integrate into society, and earn his place. Or so you would think. He just walks into town, shouting at people that he is the demon lord and internally agonizing over everything for the majority of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe world never really gets built we are just told of things as they become important until they are no longer important. It's like its rushed or was written in a bulleted list format then transformed into an anime. We don't get time to know anything which is weird because there are some major events that happen in this anime and none of it is ever discussed or brought up again. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not really sure I liked the MC. He is incredibly strong, takes on the role of a demon lord, yet acts like a child the entire time. Admittedly they explain this by saying he never was able to fit into society but after the third kidnapping incident I was becoming a little annoyed with his writing. His spells really only get cast once, leaving the later drama feeling stupid as the viewers know the powers he has.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are only there for the fan service. Occasionally getting naked, or fingered(I'm serious), or simply watching from the sidelines shouting encouragement. I like fan service and ecchi scenes, however it is boring to watch in this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was rather tame, looks like anime from a few years ago. The fight scenes are rather short and overwhelming in color so they didn't need to go all out on those either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show at first but it became more and more painful to watch as the show went on. I know very little about the characters, their goals, the world, or even the powers. It was highly underwhelming all around.",

            "content": "The Isekai genre is something that has been largely discussed by the anime community, in good and bad ways alike. But in most cases, the genre itself has a notorious reputation for not only rehashing the same concepts over and over again, but somehow have come up with the most ridiculous, pandering, bizarre, and on some occasions the most surprisingly entertaining series I've ever seen in anime. \r\nComing from someone who's watched the entirety of Smartphone, Death March, and is currently tormenting themselves withe the undeniable trash heap that is Master of Ragnarock this season, my expectations for this were fairly low. However, watching DemonLord this season had me quite surprised. In my personal opinion, this is probably one of the best Isekai anime we've gotten.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nI will say, the story is similar to most isekai stories. NEET/Otaku/whoever the hell our protagonist is either dies, activates some kind of magical object, or grants some really cheesy wish to be in another world, and boom, there they are. It's the same rehashed plotline, but this time, the main heroine's this time are...get this, it's gonna be revolutionary...slaves to the protagonist!\\n\r\nAt this point, I expect you to walk away and not even bother touching this anime, but I can assure you that it isn't as bad as it sounds. The tropes and cliches are obviously there, but they're actually managed fairly well, and while to some cliches and tropes degrade a show's overall quality, the execution of said chicles made it a pretty enjoyable watch for me.\\n\r\nAnd touching upon the subject of the show's fanservice (since this IS in the ecchi genre), I don't say this a lot but it was executed...well?\\n\r\nI mean, ecchi isn't a genre I particularly enjoy.. But the way they did it here didn't feel forced like most Ecchi shows do, and to me that's a pretty good thing. And a lot of those scenes were honestly to me, pretty hilarious. (There's one scene near the end of Episode 8...gotta have that good ass fabric.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is fairly average. It's nothing impressive for the most part, but it's during battle sequences and fanservice scenes where the animators really step up their game.\\n\r\nThe character designs are also nothing special, but they're still appealing to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nDon't really have much to say about it, other than that it's also fairly average. The OP and ED are nice, but it doesn't really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines. The characters for the most part are fairly likable here, despite a lot of them pretty much being stereotypes. But the true standout here is the main character, Diablo.\\n\r\nTHIS CHARACTER IS AN OP PROTAGONIST DONE RIGHT!\\n\r\nI'm not saying that all OP main charrcters have to be like him, but his character is just done so well. He's one of the main highlights of teh show itself. From him being a NEET, the staff clearly used that to their advantage, as there are so many hilarious moments with his awkward self trying to act as a bonafide 'Demon Lord'. If there's one comparison I can make, imagine a more awkward and comedic version of Ainz from Overlord. Not saying he doesn't have serious moments either, as he is shown to be quite the caring individual in some of the more dramatic scenes of this show. So if you asked me if you should watch it just for Diablo alone, I would absolutely sat yes. Besides Tanya Degurechaff and Kazuma, he without a doubt ranks as one of my favorite Isekai protagonists, PERIOD!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWhether you're watching this seriously or just watching this as your guilty pleasure anime of the season, this one's a hoot, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected I would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not a masterpiece, nor is it a huge trash heap. It's honestly a fun and enjoyable series to watch. Whether or not you forget about it as the new anime season arrives, this is an Isekai that you'll surely find some enjoyment in.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first glance it looks like it will avoid the pitfalls of generic Isekai. The first half starts well and the characters are likeable. From episode 7 or 8 onward I noticed the VA wasn't as good, more overdramatic or cheesy lines and lack of plot direction. Not that it had a main plot anyways. Anime like this either have a plot or they don't.\r\nUnlike other anime that try to fluff up the air time with shopping episodes, food porn and ecchi Maou starts off well. Initially I hoped they would cap the harem, which he acquired for no good reason other than \"hey it'sanime why not get some loli and oppai slaves\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis next bit isn't much of a spoiler really since I'm not actually saying what happens or their names or anything. But this is the end and if you are overly sensitive to non-spoiler heads up stop reading here. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately they just find more and more ways to throw girls in the mix from the headmaster to knight to fallen to demon lord herself.  Basically the 2nd half became increasingly ecchi and overdramatic. Some episodes I felt like they were to lazy to animate certain scenes and just cut away and panned back when said animation would have finished. Like transforming with very little animation for half a second, panning away with flashing lights and ta-da transformation over. Just lazy animation and VA could have been better in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, all things considered some comic relief is fluff and other times it is funny. Fight scenes were decent and done in a creative way that is new and different to other anime. Plot just kind of hops around and is not episodic but more like 1 plot per 2-3 episodes. It doesn't really have a real plot which is a downside that it has little potential to carry on as a story. But also an upside that it doesn't have to try to entertain you with a half hearted attempt at plot or throwing in something at the end to leave on a cliffhanger of something that will never get an S2.\\n\\n\r\nJust be prepared for more ecchi loli oppai slave harem style than you think after the first 6 episodes. And rejoice that in Maou he isn't another overpowered Isekai character that has no equal. There's still some competition for him out there and he doesn't get an easy win just because he's the lv 150 demon lord with hacks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI was satisfied with the first half and less so with the second half. Nevertheless still a good watch even for someone as critical as I am. Without details and spoilers I will leave it at that. The show would have been better if the even just cut the fan service and slutty loli outfits to half the amount. But hey IT'S ANIME. Just surprised Funimation let something this naughty run.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps.",

            "content": "Just finished last episode. hm... overall its a great seasonal anime. Although it does have certain elements that are reruns of other animes, it does have some distinct differences that make it a cut above. \r\nStory: 9\r\nOverall its a great story. of course with the influx of isekai stories this kinda just falls into that category, but there is definitely something different in the writing of it. The story part is different. Unpredictable, un-stereotypical. So, although the main concept is similar to other isekai animes (think overlord), it's story is different, which not only makes it feel fresh, but also comedic. Also, this is thefirst isekai anime where the MC is present in both forms, one as the player and two as the character. This inner dialogue only further adds to the comedy of it. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nFirst off, I watched this entire season on uncensored (which i believe you should to), and have to say, was not disappointed. It is a new anime, so the art is expected to be good. Animation is crisp, light. The action scenes do not disappoint, the directing angles and cuts are good as well. Its definitely not the best animation ive ever seen, but it meets the par for animes of this day and age. \\n\r\nAs for Character design and color choice, most match their personalities well. None of the colors are out of place, and those also reflect the story's setting and premise. Bright colors match the in-game setting of a MMORPG (or whatever they call it). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are both good, as in they fit my taste. Fast, EDM style if you want to know. In anime sound, didnt really pick up too much about it its great, but not amazing. But definitely not bad either. The soundtrack is good, it doesn't detract too much from the story. VAs are chosen well, they fit the characters that theyre representing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nSeeing as this is The Ecchi Anime of this season there was no way i was not going to enjoy it. But even without that aspect, this anime is very enjoyable. The story takes an old concept and refreshes it in some way. the storyttelling is great, unpredictable but not outlandish. The art is above average and the sound is as well. Characters are mostly well done. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this is the best anime ive ever watched, nor is it one of the best. Nor is it one of the best ecchi anime's ive ever watched. Its just a decent well rounded ecchi anime. Nothing is done wrong, but its not really pushing any sort of artistic boundary. its a great anime, but its missing that x-factor, be it story wise, animation-wise, or character wise to really push it to the 10. to break it down, id say 3 for story + 3 for ecchi + 1 for characters +1 for sound +1 for art = 9 overall. \\n\\n\r\npeace",

            "content": "Please note while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis you have been warned.  \r\nBased off the popular LN of the same name Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu which Is better known by its English title How Not to summon a Demon Lord is a fantasy, magic, comedy anime that also features quite heavy use of the Ecchi genre within its story. The anime gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a player of a popular MMORPG that owns an avatar that boasts enough overwhelming magical ability andcombat strength that he\u2019s been given the title demon lord by others were to be summoned to a world that looks remarkably like his game world. But rather than being summoned in his real-life self the player is instead summoned in the form of his avatar the self-proclaimed demon lord Diablo whose overwhelming magic and high-grade items soon turns the tables on the summoners who had wanted to enslave him who in turn is enslaved instead. Now finding himself in a world that looks exactly like that of the game that the player has been playing Diablo must not only come to grips with the fact that his real self was now his game self but also that he now has two beautiful and cute demi-humans as his slave's thanks to their reflected magic. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of having a main character be summoned or dragged into another world is not anything that\u2019s rare within the anime world given the number of animes that make use of it. However, I felt that the premise that was used in this case which was the mc being summoned to another world inside the body of his own avatar was one that I felt was a unique take on the premise as it made use of the unique relationship that exists between a player\u2019s avatar and their real-life self. The first episode of the series I felt did an excellent job of not just introducing the main characters of the series but also introduce us to the world in which the mc is summoned too and left a pretty good impression on me enough in that I decided to stick with it till the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place within a world that greatly resembles medieval Europe is a world that is populated by all sorts of fantasy races where humans are but one race among many and while each race has their own culture and beliefs all aspire to be able to live a life where they can freely choose how they live. While tensions between the races are high and discrimination of races is rampant each side tries their best to maintain the peace that exists between the races and work together to survive in a world that\u2019s rife with demon lords and dangerous fallen that live beyond the city\u2019s borders. The overall story of the series follows the adventures of Diablo a human player who finds himself being transported from his game world to another world that looks remarkably like that of his former world  thanks to the summoning ritual that was enacted by two demi-humans who had intended to use him as their servant by enslaving him with a bounding spell. However, as a result of Diablo\u2019s innate magic reflection ability this spell is instead reflected and results in the tables being turned on the summoners who become his servants instead.  As a result of not just trying to find a way back to his home and also find a way to release the slave collars that bind their necks Diablo is soon forced to embark on a wacky adventure that will see him not just inspire fear in others by acting like his character but also loyalty and respect as he encounters not just friendly individuals but also a host of villains that include rude and dominating elf lords, arrogant paladins and a demon lord that\u2019s more cute than dangerous. \\n\\n\r\nBut one things for certain there\u2019s never going to be a dull moment for Diablo and his friends as they embark on an adventure that will see them face anything from an elf army to squad of arrogant paladins who won\u2019t know evil even if it hits them in the head. Joining Diablo in this hilarious and wacky adventure is a host of characters that include the intelligent and logical Pantherian Rem, the ditzy but overly cheerful Elf Shera and the polite and caring imperial knight Alicia. As they travel together and bond with each other Diablo realizes that while the world may be different the bonds of friendship and trust that are formed between them is no less real and that by traveling together Diablo may yet be able to overcome his inner nervousness that keeps him from interacting with others in the real world. \\n\\n\r\nDiablo \\n\\n\r\nDiablo voiced by new voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A human from the real world by the name of Takuma Sakamoto that was summoned to this world in his avatar form Diablo at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was calm, level-headed and intelligent easily able to determine what had happened when he was summoned. While possessing an air of menace about him in his normal form that gave off an impression of both arrogance and pride Diablo was someone that was actually understanding and considerate of the feelings of others while at the same time possessing the foresight to determine when its time to press the issue and when not to. While a quiet person by nature and indeed someone that is not used to dealing with crowds and people in general due to his status as a Hikamori Diablo was someone that can be seen to value his friends and comrades highly and was very loyal to them and would do his utmost to protect them from harm a fact that is seen clearly in his attempts to protect them from the various threats that they encounter in their adventures. Indeed, it can be seen that Diablo values them highly enough that he will not forgive those that have caused them harm by his unleashing of the scary diablo form which is not just scary but also sinister as well. Despite his menacing appearance and the somewhat arrogant way in which he speaks to others, Diablo is someone that treats others fairly and with respect and that his manner of speech is due to the fact that he\u2019s intent on maintaining his image by roleplaying as a demon lord.  In line with this is Diablo\u2019s dislike of using violence as he believes that it should only be used as a choice of last resort. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on however and Diablo and co overcome trial after trial Diablo\u2019s personality gradually starts to change.  From the onset, it can be seen that due to Diablo\u2019s Hikamori lifestyle that Diablo is someone that has very limited social skills and as a result had an acute fear of communicating with others and especially those with a degree of power in them as seen in his conversation with Faltra\u2019s lord Galford. At the same time, it can be seen that beneath the surface Diablo is also someone that\u2019s mentally fragile and is deeply afraid of revealing his true vulnerable self to others as Diablo is afraid that by doing so he will not only lose his friends and the bonds that he has forged with them but also be hurt emotionally in the process. From this, it can be seen that Diablo\u2019s demon lord persona while a way for him to show a confident and powerful persona to others also serves to act as a shield that protects his vulnerable inner heart from the strong emotional trauma that caused him to become a Hikamori in the first place. While very glad of the demon lord persona that become an integral part of Diablo\u2019s life this as the series goes on begins to change as a result of discovering the kinds of joy that come from not just forming friendships with like-minded people but also adventuring with them which caused within him a curious desire to maybe one day be able to talk to the others normally a desire that showed just how much the friendships that he has formed has affected his personality. Despite Diablo\u2019s fear of speaking with strangers it can be seen that Diablo is someone that can be both prideful and inspirational which is shown in how he tried to convince Alicia to be less uptight and his stand to defend to the last the fortress gates from an attack by the fallen general Edelgard in an attempt to show his power as the demon lord to her. A prominent trait of Diablo that I felt took great advantage of the fact that his real-world self was actually inhabiting the body of his game avatar was the contrast between his two selves within the series that took ,the form of inner arguments between his Hikamori side and his demon lord persona something that I felt was interesting as it showed Diablo\u2019s attempts to overcome his true self\u2019s concerns in a way that\u2019s easily visible to the viewer. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Diablo I felt was an interesting one that I felt was both well designed and developed with his gradual evolution from someone that was both scared and reluctant to forge bonds with others and show his true feelings to someone that was not only able to but also developed a determination to protect those that are dear to him being especially well done. I felt that his voice actor Masaaki Mizunaka did a great job in his first main role within the industry and I wish him well in his career. \\n\\n\r\nRem Galeu \\n\\n\r\nRem Galeu voiced by new seiyuu Azumi Waki of Toji No Miko fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo\u2019s allies within the series. A female member of the Pantherian demi-human race Rem at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was quiet, intelligent and perceptive and was someone that preferred to make judgments based on facts and knowledge rather than acting on the whim as her friend Shera does. A mage of some ability Rem was someone that can be said to fit the image of an honor student being not just logical but also level-headed and knowledgeable in a wide range of matters. Indeed, it can be seen that Rem was very proud of her abilities as a mage and believed that she will make an excellent adventurer and aspired to prove this to others by joining the guild. While very proud of her abilities Rem was not someone that was arrogant and indeed was someone that was relatively honest and has no problem in praising the ability of others which I felt was a welcome change for a mage type character. While a quiet person by nature Rem was also shown to be someone that was also friendly and kind and will assist her friends and allies readily when needed no matter the odds arrayed against them showing not just her kindness but also her brave and steadfast nature. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Rem\u2019s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that beneath her rational and calm self Rem is someone that has no shortage of emotional scars within her. At the beginning of the series Rem while noted to have great pride with her ability as a mage was also someone that can be said to be quite stubborn in her determination to always do things her own way and trying the shoulder the burden that comes from it instead of asking for help from her friends. However, this rather than being a result of simple pride is rather a result of a deep-seated fear within her that arises from the unique curse that lies within her. As a result of this unique circumstance it can be seen that Rem\u2019s dislike of a need to ask people for help and her adverse views on friendships and bonds was due to her fear that people would treat her differently if they were to find out her true nature and push her away from them something that Rem has already encountered in the past. Due to this Rem in the beginning was shown to be not just stubborn but also fearful of not just bonding with others but also of forging friendships with others ever conscious of the secret that she\u2019s hiding from the others. Unsurprisingly this meant that in the beginning while having no shortage of people who she can trust Rem was someone that had very few people that she can actually call friends with the notable exceptions being that of Shera. As a result of their inner struggles, it's perhaps unsurprising that Rem and Diablo would not just bond easily but also forge strong friendships with each other due to the fact that both while acting tough on the outside were mentally fragile in the inside. While initially wary of Diablo much like Shera Rem was not just surprised at how caring and perceptive that Diablo was but also how despite the fact that her secret was known to him that Diablo not only accepted this but also treated her no differently than before and staying by her side unlike others who would have left her. \\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this Rem\u2019s attitude towards Diablo changed considerably becoming one of the few people that she can place her trust in and like Shera causing her to develop feelings for him. As a result of their shared fears of the cast Rem is perhaps one of the few that can perceive Diablo\u2019s inner turmoil and as a result, when she notices this she can be seen to try hard to understand his concerns and try to cheer him up too often amusing results. Apart from Diablo Shera is perhaps Rem\u2019s closest friend and while the two are often seen arguing with each other they are shown to be relatively close and indeed their relationship is so good in that Rem is able to easily determine when something is bothering her and when its time to step in showing that beneath her stand-offish nature Rem is also someone that can care deeply about her friends and the choices that they make in life. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Rem I felt was an interesting one that was both well designed and developed. The evolution of her character from someone that while proud and confident of her abilities was unexpectedly fragile, lonely and trusts slowly to one that learns to appreciate the advantages that friendships, trust, and honesty brings to her I felt was something that was well done. Seeing the usually quiet and logical Rem try her best to bond with Diablo and the cast I felt was a great indication of just how much Rem has developed in the course of the series. I felt that her seiyuu Azumi Waki did an excellent job at portraying the character of Rem. \\n\\n\r\nShera L Greenwood \\n\\n\r\nShera L Greenwood played by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of 3D Kanojo Girl and Twin Stars Exorcist fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo\u2019s allies within the series. A member of the Elf demi-human race Shera at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was positive, cheerful and fun-loving and was someone that was carefree by her very nature. True to her fun-loving nature Shera was someone that possessed a joking personality and as a result, was seen to be easily able to forge bonds with others due to her friendly nature. However, despite her excitable nature Shera was also shown to be relatively perceptive and cautious easily able to determine when someone is approaching them with ill intent on account of her race-specific abilities. At the same time while a kind person by nature it can be seen that Shera also has a serious side to her character that\u2019s not just competitive but also tenacious and determined a side that I felt complemented her default personality relatively well. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Shera\u2019s personality is expanded upon Shera\u2019s personality gradually changes as a result of the events that she and her friends encounter and overcome in their adventures. While a carefree, friendly and teasing person in the beginning that acted as she had not a care in the world it can be seen that beneath this Shera like Rem has no shortage of mental scars that she tries hard to hide from the others. As a result of her unique backstory it can be seen that Shera despite being born into a life that most adventurers could only dream off was one that viewed it with disdain and instead of wanting to return to that life instead aspires to not just become independent off it but also strong enough to stand on her own without having to rely on them which shows not just her strong will to succeed at her chosen task but also her determination to overcome her past trauma an aspect that I felt matched well with both her personality and her inner struggles. At the beginning of the series of the series, Shera like Rem saw Diablo as their summon and as a result was dismayed by the fact that not only did he managed to reflect the spell was supposed to have bounded him but also caused her and Rem to become his slaves instead. While Shera in the beginning only saw Diablo was someone akin to a temporary master that she can easily seduce with her assets this view of hers began to change as she began to see Diablo\u2019s true nature and the fact that despite being his slave Diablo treated both she and Rem with not just respect but also kindness and loyalty something that Shera was not used to experiencing and as a result her attitude towards him began to change. As their adventures continued and Shera began to appreciate not just the powerful magical and combat abilities that Diablo possessed but also of how kind he was as a person Shera gradually realized that she had begun to see Diablo and Rem as her first dear friends and that continuing to hide her true feelings from them would mean that she does not trust them despite the kindness that they have shown her an aspect that is shown well when Shera gets caught up in her brother\u2019s scheme to bring her back to the kingdom.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character of Shera I felt was a character that was both well designed and developed with her evolution from a positive and cheerful girl that didn\u2019t take things seriously to one that was not just determined to forge her own path in life but also determined to protect her first true friends in her life being especially well done. I felt that her seiyuu Yuu Serizawa did an excellent job at voicing the character of Shera.  \\n\\n\r\nAlicia \\n\\n\r\nAlicia Cristela voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Hara of Log Horizon and the Idolmaster fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Diablo\u2019s many acquaintances within the series. A young woman that\u2019s in her late teens and a rare female member of the vaunted imperial knights Alicia at the beginning of the series was shown to be someone that was polite, confident and kind and was someone that was both considerate to the feelings of others and caring to their needs. In a way, it can be said that Alicia was the ideal image of an imperial knight as she wasn\u2019t just kind but also diligent, level-headed and approached her role with great determination and treated any mistakes that she makes harshly a view that is shared by a great many people within the series including Diablo. \\n\\n\r\nAs can be expected of an imperial knight Alicia was someone that didn\u2019t just have excellent communication skills that Diablo lacked but was also someone that displayed her feelings openly and as a result, she was someone that can be said to keep Diablo on his toes a task that she excelled at. However, despite her seemingly professional nature it can be seen that Alicia is someone that isn\u2019t too honest with her feelings and needs and indeed is someone that can get embarrassed quite easily in denying them until it becomes too obvious to others such as her feeling hungry and not revealing it till the last minute something that I felt was quite funny and added in a sort of a childish side to her character and made her endearing in my eyes. While holding the role of an imperial knight a role that is not just highly respected within the kingdom but also feared it can be seen that Alicia is not someone that cares a great deal about her status as a knight but more of the fact that she can use that role to defend her friends and innocents from harm. While a cheerful and positive young woman it can be surprising to see that despite these qualities Alicia is someone that has few opportunities to make real friends and as a result bonding with Diablo and the girls was something that was new to both of them something that I felt was both interesting and also funny to see the latter due to the awkwardness that Alicia showed when trying to bond with the cast. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and Alicia\u2019s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that Alicia is someone that has more than one side to her personality a side that I felt was quite surprising. As a result of the training that Alicia was put through in her training to become an imperial knight she was taught that all fallen, demi-humans and demons were enemies or at least beings that were not trustworthy and it was a view that had sustained her and powered her through her career as a knight becoming the prime motivation for her public face. However, despite that this view of hers becomes challenged after she encounters and befriends Diablo and co as part of her duties and even more so when she saw that contrary to her teachings Diablo despite being a demon lord was someone that was not just kind and caring to everyone that he meets but also someone that preferred to use diplomacy to settle matters and only use violence as a last resort. This is further reinforced by the shock that she received when the demon lord Klem was released from her prison as compared to Diablo she was much more radically different. \\n\\n\r\nThese twin shocks to Alicia\u2019s psych while causing her great confusion also eventually contributed greatly to awakening within Alicia her true persona that she had so far kept suppressed and hidden within her mind one that was radically different to her public face. Alicia\u2019s true face that was revealed due to the twin shocks was one that can be said to be the complete opposite of that her public role as an imperial knight as here rather than viewing demons and fallen with hatred she instead views them with something akin to admiration. At the same time Alicia\u2019s core traits of kindness, politeness and her caring nature towards her friends is replaced by one that is deceitful, malicious and manipulative and showing a fearful determination to get to her goal by any means necessary even if it meant betraying her friends and allies that she so valued in the past. This radical change of her character I felt was something that was both unexpected and interesting as it essentially made her an enemy to not just Diablo and co but also to the very role that she was supposed to be loyal to. The character of Alicia I felt was a well designed and developed character whose evolution from an ideal imperial knight that was both kind, caring and loyal to her friends to someone that was both deceitful and manipulative and willing to betray her friends in order to achieve her goals that were counter to those of her role I felt was really well thought out. I felt that her seiyuu Yumi Hara really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Alicia. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the designs for the main and supporting characters within the series were well designed and remained faithful to their source material. In particular I felt that the clothing that was worn by the main cast did a great job of showcasing not just the races that their characters belong too but also their professions and personalities as well with notable examples being Diablo\u2019s demonic cloak and armor set that was supposed to convey authority, Shera\u2019s outfit which conveyed freedom and Rem\u2019s more subdued outfit that was supposed to convey logic but at the same time allow her to blend in more. The various settings and locale that the cast visit within the series I felt was also well designed with the setting doing a good job of conveying to the viewer and to Diablo that while this world may be similar to the game world it was not that world by having a contrast of a comfortable medieval and fantasy style town with a harsh and unforgiving world of cruelty and harshness that lie beyond its walls. In terms of combat animation, I felt that the many fights within the series whether its small scale duals between Diablo and human opponents and Diablo\u2019s fight against monsters was pretty well done with the fights being not just well designed but also unpredictable in terms of battle events and outcomes something that I felt kept me on my toes throughout the series and making each fight more interesting than I thought with notable examples being Diablo\u2019s defense of the fortress from the fallen and Edelgard, the dual with Galford and the fight against Shera\u2019s brothers summon. This was helped greatly within the series by the large number of spells and magic effects that were present within the series that had the effect of making each fight much more impressive visually. \\n\\n\r\nMusic wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Decide which was sung by Summoners 2+ a voice unit formed by Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki, Yumi Hara, Rumi Ookubo and Emiri Katou who voiced the characters of Shera, Rem, Alicia, Sylvie and Edelgard and Saiaku na hi demo Anata ga Suki which was by Shera\u2019s seiyuu Yuu Serizawa. Both of these songs I felt were strong ones with the former doing a good job of creating a sense of anticipation for the series as we wait to see what Diablo and his friends get up to while the latter conveyed a sense of farewell and a promise to tune in again next episode. The series OST I felt did a great job of providing strong background music to the many different types of scenes within the series. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or supporting ones. In particular, I felt that Masaaki Mizunaka, Yuu Serizawa, Azumi Waki and Yumi Hara all did an excellent job in portraying their assigned characters which were Diablo, Shera, Rem and Alicia respectively. Additionally, while I didn\u2019t cover them within this review I also felt that Rumi Ookubo, Emiri Katou, Sayaka Senbongi, Atsumi Tanezaki, and Akio Ootsuka also did a great job of portraying the supporting cast of Sylvie, Edelgard, Celestine, Klem and Galford respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo, no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I really enjoyed watching with its main strong points being its interesting premise, well-designed story, well designed and developed characters, interesting fights, strong voice acting and an interesting fusion of comedy, fantasy and ecchi genre\u2019s that actually works. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise of the series which is of a character from the real world being transported to another world is one that\u2019s already well-trodden. However rather than mimicking what other series have already done so by transporting the real person in their real body to the world the series changes this formula and makes use of its own unique take on it by instead transporting the mc into the world as a character that\u2019s he\u2019s most familiar with which is the character that the main character has spent years painstaking creating in another game. This itself I felt was interesting because unlike the outer self that the mc is seen with by the inhabitants of this world the mc\u2019s true self that\u2019s hidden behind the outer shell is one that can be seen to have a totally different personality and indeed is one that is a direct contrast to the outer self. This contrast of the inner demon king that\u2019s indecisive and easily scared with his outer self that's confident and menacing was something that I thought the series used really well as it allowed the main character to not just overcome his own inner weakness of being quiet and unsociable but also mask this development by projecting his confident and menacing self to his friends and to his enemies to both inspire and frighten something that was used effectively when paired with the series story. At the same time, this also lent itself to a number of noteworthy comedy moments that were used to both progress the plot but show this development of Diablo\u2019s character with a good example being Diablo\u2019s mismatch of tones when addressing people. The overall story of the series I felt was surprisingly well thought out as it not just made great use of comedy, fantasy and ecchi moments but also weaved this into a number of story arcs that were not just interesting but populated by some pretty designed villains that were not simply one dimensional and had some surprising traits to them that made them stand out with notable examples being Galford the lord of Faltra, Saddler the most arrogant paladin I ever seen and Klem the demon lord that\u2019s more cute than dangerous.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu was an anime that I found to be really entertaining and one that made great use of its unique premise, story, well designed and developed characters and rare fusion of various genre\u2019s that\u2019s rarely used together. As a final score, I would say that Isekai Maou to Shoukan Shoujo no Dorei Majutsu easily deserves a final score of 10/10.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

A Shut-in Uber gamer with an OP game character gets teleported to the game world and becomes that OP character. \r\nSo what sets this apart from other Isekai?\r\nWell a few things actually. \r\nOur MC is a socially inapt shut in with zero social skills role playing and audacious demon lord. There isn't a moment when this doesn't come to play as even the smallest of social interactions weighs heavy on our MC. Battling monsters and casting mountain leveling spells? Ptt they're nothing.... now negotiating withthe inn keeper for a room.. HELP!!!\\n\\n\r\nHe actually curls up in his bed whenever an interactions goes sideways and needs to be yanked out of it before mold starts growing on him. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a rare instance were the MC in an Isekai is interesting and you see the vulnerable person behind the avatar. You also see an OP character depend on strategy and in-depth knowledge of the games mechanics which is actually cool and gives his character more depth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing is that side characters. Each have their own motivations, back story and drive. The dynamic between them is what moves the story each and every time. All the characters are very expressive and just fun to watch. They are there for their own reason not to just \"we love MC\" like mindless cheerleaders. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this far then you're probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the elephant in the room. \\n\\n\r\nFan service isn't just a feature in this anime it's one of the main cast! You just have to watch the OP theme to have it thrown in your face (jiggle included.) \\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing. The focus is on the fun aspect of it. Yes there are boobs, butts and slave collars and the show is not apologizing for them. The characters are having fun with all of it, The shows creators are clearing having fun with it and using unusual angles to make it as funny as possible, so why complain? Have fun as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFun, Funny and light. This is both Isekai and Ecchi done right. No holier then thou cardboard cut out of an MC OR rapey mc rapist in this one.",

Truth to be said this Isekai anime is a disappointment, what happened to the producers, did they ran out of ideas?",

If you want that type of isekai, go watch Log Horizon or Overlord.\r\nThis is a show for those who know that they have too much free-time and want to waste that on semi-hentai garbage. Even though this show is super dumb, it's still enjoyable, because you're not trying to look for plot-holes, you're just expecting the next dumbpretext to show off some boobs, just like Monster Musume, and you know what? That's perfectly fine.

Its everything you've ever seen in the sense that it's the guy that gets brought over to another world with all of the powers that his character had, but on the other hand you can tell that the studio animating it was trying to animate above their skill level. Because a lot of times when a studio is not as skilled they will focus pretty much from the waist up because its hard to animate leg movement, not this studio. The quality of the anime itself (art wise) does drop a little when their is a lot ofaction overall but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. The MC honestly acts in the same way that I would act, he's surprised at first but then he kind of \"tests\" what he is capable of compared to when he was playing the game in front of his computer. I don't mind fan service, but holy sh*t please tone it down just a tad. It's pretty much with the same character at least right now, but it's starting to get irritating. The music...besides the opening I can't even remember what other music there is...so there's that. In the end the show is enjoyable to watch but it's definitely not making my top 10 anytime soon.",

If it doesn't bother you but you want some substance, don't worry it has substance. If you love fan service, then this is the series for you, since it is used often to comedic effect. \r\nFor 12 episodes, the story is adequate. It sets up the world and a major plot element, adequately paces the story stitching events together to a good conclusion.\r\nArt/Animation: 9\r\nLet's not kid ourselves, with this much fan service they delivered onthe harem's boob physics. Outside of that, the art is consistently great, the fights are well drawn/animated/executed and exciting. Definitely some wow moments that make you want to replay the scene more than once. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is what surprised me the most. Every character easily could have been one dimensional trash, but all the main characters are really fleshed out and you can empathize with each of their situations. Even the support characters are fun/exciting/interesting!\\n\\n\r\nI would love to see more of this series, though I don't think they should expand the harem too much more. It's pretty sizable at the end. If it doesn't continue, then it's a well encapsulated series that is satisfying and won't require a huge time investment. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "The series is a competent dip into the isekai genre. All the general classics of the genre exist in this series, overpowered protagonist, harem, fan service, NEET main character and more, however they're not all included in obnoxious ways.\r\nThe story is somewhat standard, the world being a very basic \"Humans and demihumans struggling to coexist\", though it doesn't go as hard into the theme as it could've done by only making one of the main chararacters human. The level system that's weakly explored doesn't really have any merits and it's not used enough for us to actually understand it and how powerful different characters aresupposed to be through it. Fanservice takes a bit too big of a front in the story for my own tastes and I would've prefered if it had taken up a smaller part of the actual story, a few plot points actually coming down to direct fan service. A few plot points were dropped on the floor after being explored for a little but. That being said, the story is competently enough executed to not warrant a bad score, though I think the last act could've benefited from an extra episode as some of the scenes are taken through kind of fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle has no real problems. Only once did I ever notice the fact that CGI was used to create a single shot. At times there were some nice effects and I never felt confused about what was happening on screen. Character designs were at least somewhat interesting and even a good amount of background characters got more than a minute's thought put into how they were designed.\\n\\n\r\nI never had a \"This is amazing!\" moment with the sound design, though once again, I never had any problems with it either. I sadly found myself skipping the intro and outro after the first time as I honestly weren't interested in them. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters weren't really bad, but some secondary characters had one aspect that could describe their entire personality, which at times was a little tiring. The main character was interestingly carried by \"in-game\" statistics at times, his charisma being entirely carried by the fact that his character back when it was a game had a few points in it and at one point allowing him to do alchemy while specifically not focusing, which was a funny quirk. The two main female leads sadly don't have many characteristics to explain them and they could've been explored a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half of the show decently. The ending of the second act as well as a good part of the third act weren't all as enjoyable, but I still had fun watching it. Overall, I think it's a fine show. If people want a competent Isekai show, this would be my 3rd choice to send them to, overshadowed by \"Overlord\" and \"That time I got Reincarnated as a Slime\".",

Now now, trying to adhere to a specific norm isn't necessarily a bad thing, you would get loads of identical piles of shit, but in the process you'll also allow further exploration and presentation of the genre, which is hard to achieve when it's a rarely touched genre.\r\nOn to the anime itself\r\nFrom the first glance, it might seem like a heavily fanservice-oriented anime that doesn't try to prove that it's different from others. Purely made for the fanserivice. But the reality strays alot further from my expectation.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the typical hikki heroine going into an alternative world plot progression, commonly seen in other isekai animes, like Outbreak Company, Re:Zero, NGNL and some others. But this one focuses heavily on the protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to hikki heriones, the anime will often associate feelings of anxiousness, depression, fear, misanthropy, isolation and alienation. These feelings are often unexplored or only explored on a really light threshold. This anime explores the above feelings in a realistic way, and bases MC's personality and dialogs around it. It doesn't try to explicitly show the feelings, and instead presents certain elements and hints to direct the viewer towards interpreting those feelings. I am really fond of implicit narratives, as they are often not apparent and tend to go with the atmosphere. But explicit narratives are more common in today's world of anime, where the most popular example would be the monogatari series, where there's a single strong narrative directing the plotline.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to the anime, do realize that it is indeed fanservice-oriented, and that there will be fanservice scenes that are forced. Other than that, elements of the plot have a large potential for improvement, as it tries to explore an often unexplored area in anime, which is the feelings that arise from extended self-isolation. Character-development wise, most of the main characters introduced throughout the first few episodes have really distinct personalities, speech patterns, and thought patterns. The MC also has a really distinct facade and inner voice that he puts on throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nWith further exploration of the plot, through slowing down plot progression and further elaboration of the character's true thoughts (because I think that there's a lot more to explore, this anime is going too fast!), I believe that this has the potential to be a very decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you're asking yourself, should I watch it?\\n\r\nIf you don't necessarily mind heavy and forced fanservice scene (this anime balances fanservice and plot quite well tbh), it should provide you the enjoyment of a slightly above average isekai anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of implicit narration, and a hikki MC deeply relates to you, then this will be a really decent anime (provided that you don't find heavy fanservice intrusive).\\n\r\nIf you don't want fanservice and only want implicit narration, I would recommend checking out Sora no Woto.",

Which in the end it does defy those expectations in that it is ecchi by the loosest of terms and that there is a reasonably decent storyline in there, nothing surprising but not the utter trash I was expecting. \r\nDL's story consists of the all too common these days loner who is summoned to another world. Of course, he is invoked as the all-powerful game character that he spent most of his time playing before beingsummoned. The world is, of course, similar to his game so he does not have too much difficulty adjusting to it.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we need to talk about the whole slavery thing. See the main guy was summoned to be one of the main girl's summons? Pet? I honestly can't remember but due to some powerful game item that allows him to reflects all magic the enslavement magic reflects into both of the main girls and they, in turn, become his slaves. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the fact of how nonplussed most of these isekia protagonists seem to feel toward slavery, the show kind of handles this decently. In the way, the Japanese Government handles past war crimes by simply ignoring it happened. Not to say it doesn't come up in the show but it rare for it to be mentioned as the girls always have their autonomy and he never compulses them to do anything.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and while we at it, let's talk about the ecchi portion of this show because, in the end, this amounts to baby's first ecchi. Now I understand if your not into that kind of thing, but in that case, I am not sure what you were expecting from this show. For all intents and purposes, this was supposed to be a main selling point of the show.  But let me tell you the steamiest part of this show is when they cuddle in bed together or him kissing the demon lord.....real steamy I tell ya (he says super sarcastically)\\n\\n\r\nWhat perplexed me most is I was watching the uncensored version too. The only thing I can think of is the studio was trying to market this at children as well which is a whole other can of worms. \\n\\n\r\nDiablo character development is what saves this show for me from falling into the total stinkers category. Its nothing too surprising but throughout the show, he gets to overcome his social anxieties that are somewhat compelling to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOh should mention I watched this dubbed, and it was good nothing so bad to make me switch to the sub. It does have that kind of campiness you get with ecchi dubs, but I instead enjoy that as I'm not too serious about these kinds of shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is by no means utter garbage, but at the end of the day ends up meh with even the attempted fan service falling flat on its face.  Save yourself 4 hours of your life and stay away from this show.  I watched the dub of this, and it was pretty good, at no point did I feel the need to change to the sub.",

It is not outright horrible, but it is surely disappointing.\r\nStory isn't much to write home about (if you saw a lot of other anime, that is), it just just that it barely moves and feels lifeless. It doesfollow the manga fairly faithfully, but skips over some interesting details, and the manga wasn't exactly stellar to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nSo, since it is based on six episodes, I'll keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is interesting, but after promising first episode it slows down and becomes utterly boring.

More emotion, excitement, story turns, or something. It kills the show, pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10:\\n\r\nFirst episode had some nice fireworks in it, but after that everything looks fairy low detailed. They don't go full chibi mode there, it is just backgrounds aren't really impressive or interesting, things look kinda soulless, and characters have bare minimum amount of details on them.

Nothing really stood out there, neither good nor bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10:\\n\r\nGet old quickly. They don't have enough punch for a gag stereotypes, and aren't believable enough for real people. The gimmick behind diablo is interesting for the first two episodes, then gets old.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10:\\n\r\nI seriously tried to complete this one, but I gave up. It is simply too dull for my liking and there's nothing I can do about it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10:\\n\r\nToo dull for me. Manga was slightly better, but not by much, as original story was 5/10 material at best. It might make more sense to check the manga instead of anime. It could maybe be a good idea to watch the first episode and drop it afterwards - because of the fireworks in it.\\n\\n\r\nFor a generic \"thrown into otherworld with overpowered ability\" anime,this anime needs something - more comedy, or more episodes where the main character gets to display his power. Instead .... it has nothing. And as such it becomes boring.",

As craptastic as that may sound as a premise, this is actually much better than you would think it would be going into it.  Yes, once again, a neet/hikikomori is mysteriously dragged into a video game world.  Once again, because this one specific game was more important to him than his real life, he is OP.  Once again, the player attracts a group of adventurers who go about adventuring and such.  It's no different from SAO, Log Horizon, Overlord, etc... in that regard.  \r\nHowever, even though the premise is becomingstale, the execution was well done.  The characters were likable enough, the action was well animated, the comedy usually hit the right note, and there were a couple of surprising and very exciting moments.  Really, this anime is one that clearly wanted to differentiate itself from the rest of the field by using ecchi aspects.  Fortunately, these aspects didn't permeate throughout the entire anime, but just during the crew's rest periods, so it didn't interfere with the main plot or cheapen important events with fan service.  \\n\\n\r\nI think my only real complaint about the anime is the ending was a little too...meh.  Not really a mind blowing ending, but not a terrible ending, either.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think is an enjoyable anime.

I'd pass on it as it doesn't offer anything to make it worth watching and if it ever gets a season 2 it will probably be an atrocity.\r\nSpoilers: Man does this show start out really surprisingly good for the genre (Isekai Echie). The main character is an antisocial mmorpg expert and he gets sent to a game world. That has been done a million times now but the way he covers up his inability to deal with people by putting on a demon lord persona is very funny attimes so that offers a new twist. The reason he gets called to another world is because of a synchronized summoning spell gone wrong by the two female leads: A silent and more reserved loli cat girl (who dresses way more revealingly than fits with her character type) and a bubbly happy go lucky elf character with a very curvy body and no sense of personal space.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters compliment each other well and the friendship they form is very enjoyable and their antics are genuinely funny because the show takes a worn out out genre in a few new directions. Hell even the backstories for the female leads are well done and make you feel genuine emotion for their positions.\\n\\n\r\nHoly hell does this show get hype quickly when an army attacks and one of the female leads is almost assassinated. It is very satisfying to see a \"Demon Lord\" go beast mode and wreck an army before saving his girl. At this point I would have given the show an 8/10 overall but the rest of the show is entirely downhill.\\n\\n\r\nThere were several warning signs that this could happen from the start, such as the main character despite being a regular mmo player clearly has abilities that are way beyond anything a player character should have in a game. Things like the ability to reflect all magic thanks to an enchanted ring that was given only to the first player to beat a difficult boss. No mmorpg would ever give out such a stupidly op ability because it completely breaks the game and makes that character impossible to be damaged by anyone in the game that plays a mage. Stupidly unbalanced. And his dps (damage per second) is so stupidly over the top there is no way a game would allow a character to level up to the point where they could kill 100 boss monsters with a single spell. That's just dumb. It would have been way more satisfying (and better written) if the main character simply had an ability that would reflect the first magic spell cast at him after he cast his reflect ability and it had a cooldown after it was activated so that way mages wouldn't instantly lose against him and he would have a reasonable advantage that he worked hard to obtain. And it would have been way more incredible to show him actually fight against 100 boss monsters and beat them with skill as opposed to just using a single spell so stupidly powerful no game would ever allow players to use.\\n\\n\r\nI could overlook the not overly obnoxious flaws from the first few episodes however the show has to put the main character in crisis to add suspense and they wrote him to be as powerful as God so they can only do this in two ways: 1 -  making him incredibly retarded, and 2 - sloppy writing.\\n\\n\r\n1 - He is clearly aware how powerful he is and yet he repeatedly lets his two female companions that both have people hunting them go around on their own without him and every time they almost get killed or get abducted. His only weakness is that there are two girls and he can't be in two places at the same time so for fucks sake just ask them both to stay together when you go on quests or out around town. Instead he goes on quests with one of them and the other in a town miles away will almost get her head ripped off or he'll hear bounties have been placed on one and let her wander around in the shopping district and be surprised when someone tries to kidnap her. Absolutely retarded.\\n\\n\r\n2 - At one point all of the characters are walking together and one of them gets kidnapped because she literally, with the main character directly in front of her decides to follow a different person and wonder where the main character went and he has no idea where she went because she followed someone else in a different direction despite being easily able to have called out to him and at least let him know she was following this other character. She literally just followed her kidnapper away without a word to anyone or wondering why they were walking in a different direction.\\n\\n\r\nAfter stuff like that starts happening the show becomes a wreck. A low level mage (compared to the main character) casts a spell on one of the girls suffocating her directly in front of the main character that can kill 100 boss level monsters with a single spell and he just starts angrily talking to the guy before getting into a fight with him and letting it take way longer than required to stop his girl from choking. He could have immediately cast a single spell that would have either killed the enemy mage or cause him incredible pain/to pass out if he didn't want to kill him and instead he let some random assclown choke his girl with magic right in front of him for a bit. If you care for these girls and have the power of a god why the hell don't you protect them more?!? Where is the fury and indignation that some shit mage just started choking a girl you care for?!? Why aren't you casting a spell that will turn him into a crater so big it shakes the city or frying him to near death with a lightning bolt like the divine judgement of an enraged god?!?\\n\\n\r\nBy the time it gets to the episode where the only way to save one of the girls is to give her \"the shocker\" (yes the two in the pink one in the stink fingering gesture people used to think was funny in second grade) the show had become such a trainwreck it was borderline unwatchable imo and I tend to have a higher tolerance for garbage than most people.\\n\\n\r\nThe show just really drops the ball after a decent enough setup and it really bothers me because in the first few episodes the characters were so good together and the jokes were funny. I still give it a 6/10 overall because of how good it started out but the end half of the show is closer to a 3/10.",

The awkward small talk, the moral judgments about having 2 slave girls that happens to become yours for pretty much no reason and that for pretty much no reason want to stay this way with the MC.\r\nI am not as awkward as him but I really can relate on how to interact with people when having to show your vulnerable side and I enjoy how he tortures himself trying to be his best self not to show he isn't what he wants peopleto think he is. He's just a normal dude trying to fit in the role he is given. In a way he is each of us trying to fit where we belong, having second thoughts, doubts, being outright scared of the outcome of an action...\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand you have a lot of pretty interesting female characters so at least one will be to your taste. Which is a plus. \\n\\n\r\nYou could think it is somewhat like Overlord but here you have more of an adventure side to the story like in Konosuba for example. Overlord feels more like a sandbox world with no particular thing to do in comparison. But you could say that in this anime and the two other I talked about, the MC is pretty much a neet that got into a weird position and has to deal with it. So if you liked either of those, you probably will enjoy this anime.",

(when reading the synopsis, this show reminded me of Hataraku Maou-sama, but with the roles sort of reversed which was the only factor that got me intrigued in this show)\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is nothing to write home about but is fairly decent and enjoyable but no one cares about that. \\n\\n\r\n///segue///\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to what I know you guys are here for: the Harem and Ecchi elements of this show and guess what?

It's okay I guess. Personal Enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? Nah, if you're not here for the fanservice and is looking for a pretty good Isekai show, you're better off not wasting your time with this and just go watch Overlord if you haven't already.",

            "content": "Isekai, Isekai, Isekai. Used to be one of my favorite genre's but unfortuneately what used to be an easy form of world building for someone who doesn't have the ability, time or want to start from complete and utter scratch like Full Metal Alchemist, Naruto, Steins; Gate, and/or Evangelion. Isekais are now fan service, cheap world building filmworks. You look at films like Konosuba, re;zero, or even Overlord even though im not a fan and see their clear destinctions.\r\nCharacter driven plot vs story building plot? Two types of plots. I can't even fathom a third. One, derived off of backstory, setting and the great characterbuilding of off panels characters. Like Alfonso's mom, someone who mattered and pushed the plot despite almost never encountering her. Or Madara. Of the guy sending the text messages in Steins; Gate. \\n\r\nHowever, this...this is somehow neither. The plot itself isn't there. It's almost like an OVA where character setting and rules are what guide it. A lot of Isekai's are like this...in the beginning. Everytime we end a somewhat plot \"take off point,\" we lewd it.\\n\r\nLike Marvel does with intense scenes to make jokes I think it's called Mathos? Or something like that. But they use sex....unfortuneately that's very hard to do and usually depends on a character having an entire personality, background and off panel characters of his own to contrast with others to nail the \"mathos\" home. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters make anime, anime. Who are our favorite characters? Side characters. No one actually cares about the main character..he's just, ya know, there to make everything else look good. It's what makes Japanese anime GOOD. We're side tracked with animation, waifu's, best gals, weapons, and cool fighting techniques/quirks/jutsu's. We stan different villages, gangs or off panel members we'd love to finally encounter. This anime isn't bad at all; it just depends on \"mathos.\" too much without actually nailing it.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been thinking as of late that it\u2019s about time I figured out how to properly handle ecchi shows. This genre has always been a massive stumbling block for me; I\u2019m not opposed to the presence of raunchy, sexual, and erotic material in media, but the way anime handles that kind of stuff, especially in shows explicitly focused around it, always feels so grossly condescending, insultingly cheap, and awash in moronic contrivance for the sake of shoving skin on screen (not to mention often misogynistic as hell, but that\u2019s a rant for another day). As a straight guy with at least a modicum of self-respect,I don\u2019t see the appeal in shows that pander to *my* demographic this explicitly and shamelessly unless they\u2019re just straight up hentai. Masturbation is one thing, but I expect at least a little better from a show that\u2019s actually trying. Still, I will always maintain that no genre or trope is inherently broken or irredeemable, so you gotta figure there\u2019s at least some ecchi stuff out there that\u2019s worth more than an idle midnight wank. And at first, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord seems like it might actually manage that impossible feat. For the first few episodes, I was, if not swept away, at least invested in the proceedings and having a decent time. Could this be the ecchi anime that finally makes me embrace my degeneracy?\\n\\n\r\nWell, no, as it turns out. In fact, How Not to- ah fuck it, I\u2019ll just call it Demon Lord from now on- is pretty much a textbook example of why this genre gives me so much pause, how its codified tropes and conventions end up undermining its ability to connect with me. As is so often the case with ecchi shows, I feel like I would have enjoyed it so much more without the ecchi elements. So let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t figure out why.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the story: in typical isekai fashion, our protagonist is sucked into the world of his favorite video game, a fantasy mmorpg in which he is by far one of the most powerful players. In his case, he ends up inhabiting the body of his in-game avatar: Diablo, a demon lord with an extensive mastery of the game\u2019s mechanics who enjoys playing the part of the manical, tyrannical overlord. His summoners, an elf girl named Shera and a cat girl named Rem (no, not that one), were attempting to cast an enslavement ritual on him, obtaining a powerful servant to go on adventures with. But thanks to magical fuckery, the spell ends up rebounding, and Shera and Rem both become Diablo\u2019s slaves, complete with heavy collars around their next. None of them, least of all Diablo, are happy with that arrangement, so it\u2019s off to the races as this wacky band of misfits do the typical isekai explore-the-world-and-go-on-adventures shenanigans, all while looking for a way to remove the collars and running into a cast of middlingly interesting waifu bait/side characters. Oh, and there are boob physics. Lots and lots of boob physics.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, that description sounds like just another pedestrian, run-of-the-mill power fantasy that\u2019s become so depressingly common in the isekai genre, positioning the audience surrogate as the most Special, Awesome Person Alive(tm) who kicks all the ass and gets all the girls. And yet, what ends up turning Demon Lord into such a colossal disappointment is that at first, it actually does a halfway-decent job justifying its tropes and telling an actual story with them. Diablo, Shera, and Rem all have fun chemistry with each other, and the goofiness of their interactions makes spending time with them actually fun. Diablo himself has a welcome streak of crippling social anxiety that helps make him feel far more human than many of his self-insert contemporaries (Sure, No Game No Life did it better, but it still works here). Hell, the whole slavery thing alone could so easily tread into really creepy territory, but the show makes a very wise decision early and often in not positioning the central threesome (heh) as a master and his servants. None of the main trio see their relationship in those terms at all; they\u2019re companions first and foremost, developing into closer and closer friends as the story progresses. It even leads to a couple of touching moments, where the subtleties of their interactions really sell how much they\u2019re coming to trust each other and their unusual living situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, my initial impression of Demon Lord was a show that could make smart, justified choices in service of the dumb, silly story it was trying to tell. Beyond the ridiculous boob jiggles and panty shots, there was genuine craft on display, a sense that we weren\u2019t just trying to coast by on the flash of fanservice with nothing of substance underneath. Sure, it wasn\u2019t anything special, but it was managing to hit that sweet spot of good storytelling that made it easier to stomach some of its more aggravating aspects. And I was genuinely enjoying my time with it. Sadly, once the first arc ended and that initial glow wore off, my frustrations with the show just started piling up more and more until they buried all my investment under a mountain of bullshit. The further the story drags on, the weaker and more mindless it becomes. The welcome subtlety of those early episodes is replaced by maudlin, unearned melodrama that\u2019s too childish and grating to land. The plotting gets bogged down in too much stuff going on, expanding outward like a puke puddle without ever deepening to watch that expansion. And while the production values are consistently solid, full of stylish colors and strong animation, I found myself more and more annoyed at the thought that such a good production was being wasted on such a nothing of a story. Demon Lord manages an impressive degree of finesse early on, but it can\u2019t maintain it for a full twelve episodes. Not when there are more g-strings we can be sticking the big-tittied elf girl in.\\n\\n\r\nWhich bring me, at last, to the reason this ecchi show ended up falling so flat for me: the ecchi itself. This was one aspect that just never worked for me, even in the early episodes. And in reflecting upon it, I think it speaks to my wider problem with fanservice in general: it so rarely actually matters. The story may have its occasional flashes of nuance and originality, but the sexy stuff is never more creative than just doing the same shit literally every anime has done with it. There\u2019s nothing here that I haven\u2019t seen mindlessly repeated countless times before. It doesn\u2019t serve the show in any fashion other than to just... exist. It\u2019s a distraction, a joke, a meaningless addition that doesn\u2019t actually add anything. It\u2019s not here because the specific requirements of the story benefit from an abundance of barely-concealed nipples; it\u2019s here because it\u2019s hot, and therefore, sad virgin nerds will maybe buy enough figures to keep the studio running. And speaking as a sad virgin nerd myself, I take offense to that ethos. I am not so easily swayed that molesting a cat girl to orgasm in the first episode will suddenly blind me to all the flaws you\u2019re trying to hide behind that moaning face of release. Sex deserves better from anime. It deserves more creativity, more originality, more thought, more justification, and more purpose. Or barring that, at least just don\u2019t stoop so low as to literally rip off the infamous Oberon Rape scene from Sword Art Online. Seriously, of all the fucking ideas to pilfer from SAO, you go with its single most commonly hated scene by far? How wrong-headed can you get?\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, it was that scene in particular that finally shattered the spell for me. No show that can so mindlessly copy one of the most universally reviled moments in anime history could ever be worth that much. Perhaps one day I\u2019ll find an ecchi anime that genuinely works for me, that uses sex to its benefit and not its detriment, that succeeds because of, not in spite of, its baser instincts. Until then, though, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord should serve as a reminder of how easily this kind of story can go wrong, how easily the supposed draw of sexy girls can overwhelm and poison the actual merits of the world you\u2019ve created. I didn\u2019t hate it, but for what those first couple episodes hinted at could have been, I am interminably frustrated with what we actually got.",
