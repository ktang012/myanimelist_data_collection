            "content": "To be honest Flip Flappers should-be more popular. I felt that it had all the material needed to engage with audiences regardless of their preferences, and most importantly sell great merchandise. The only thing that stopped me from giving the incredible piece of art a solid 10 was the strange and often times confusing story; which I'll get into in a moment so please keep sitting in your chair, or levitating above, you wizards.\r\nSo what is Flip Flappers about? Why should you be watching it? Can you eat it? Only two of the three questions above will be answered.\r\nFlip Flappers\u2019 story is interesting in manyways. We follow the lives two cute girls, there\u2019s intense action, amazing visuals, a yuri undertone lurking. What more could you want\u2014 other than nudity, perv. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story can be hit or miss depending on your preferences. If you\u2019re into simple story-telling and plot developments then Flip flappers most likely won\u2019t be on your watch list. The plot, the real plot, not fan-service is very confusing at times. It is so bad to the point where I found myself questioning \u201cwhat the hell going on?\u201d in certain episodes. You see, Flip Flappers method of storytelling is hard to follow\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThere are often times too many distractions, mostly imagery, that if you miss a single detail then you will be momentarily confused as to what is happening in the story. This is extremely prevalent when there are scenes filled to the brim with dialogue and monologues. Personally, I found myself getting lost in the vibrant imagery or special effects while characters were talking. Now as far as the story telling goes, the \u201cdirection\u201d I have to say that I strongly believe that both the narrative was straight forward as to be expected. Flip Flappers method of storytelling is \u201cthe hero\u2019s journey.\u201d For example, think of movies like Harry potter or Lord of the rings. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the scenario, something bad or out of the ordinary happens. This causes the girls to go on an adventure to solve the problem; they receive supernatural aid, and get just a bit of character development. As their adventure progresses, they run into the antagonist whom they proceed to do battle with. At this point, \u201cdeath & rebirth\u201d kicks in. The girls lose, but suddenly realize that this battle is important, plot armor kicks in, and they both gain some sort of supernatural ability that helps them defeat the antagonist. After the grueling battle rests, a predictable outcome, the heroes succeed and head back home where everything is nice and happy.\\n\\n\r\nNow with \u201cthe journey \u201cthat the girls go on. It is not incredible but it sure is unique. During the span of the entire series Papika and Cocnoa are involved in some type of journey that teaches them both lessons. For example they both need each other. They\u2019re friends! Most of the problems the two have to fix during the series, I perceived them as stepping blocks for the two to continue building their budding relationship.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s never a dull moment in the Flip Flappers\u2019 story I feel like it provided more than enough entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, depending on if you have a good eye or are just really experienced with watching anime. One would assume Gainax worked this title with its unique choices in art. However, they didn\u2019t (as far as my knowledge goes) do much in the animation department. The credits in episode 11 say that they were used for outsourcing. This is common in the anime industry. Personally I believe that their unique art style was used as inspiration for 3hz. \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are beautiful despite lacking detail and high quality at times. Character designs are unique, cute which is most important. On the other hand, the animation wasn\u2019t as impressive. I felt like there could\u2019ve been improvements to the aesthetics and quality to make the show look more modern. HOWEVER! And Honestly, I think everything worked out. I enjoyed the beauty the show had to offer. It has a sort of \u201cdreamscape\u201d fantasy design to it. This choice fits with the theme of the show. Lastly, the colors are rich and the special effects are fluid.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does an excellent job setting the mood for certain situations. I felt that the composer did a wonderful job of creating songs that fit theme of the show. Happy, jaunty, tunes, the bells are of course the most important part. Voice acting was good to say the least. I didn't feel like the actors were anything special. The opening and ending song... Scratch the opening song. The ending song perfectly describes what the show is about! the sound director deserves to be acknowledge for their contributions to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: Flip flappers deserves some notoriety for its great efforts and contributions to the fall 2016 season. I felt that this title was incredibly fun to watch! The characters, art, soundtrack and story. There was so many things that I liked in the show that made it enjoyable. I had to give Flip Flappers a solid 9/10 because of how great I felt watching everything unfold.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is the textbook definition of a hidden gem. A short, artistic original anime by a relatively unknown studio, and also an anime which is quite difficult to explain. This is partially because of its symbolic themes, but also because the execution itself is very unorthodox. It is like the anime equivalent of an LSD trip; something I can only describe as a crossover of FLCL and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita. But somehow, Studio 3Hz actually made it work, resulting in what I would probably have to consider my favorite anime of Fall 2016.\r\nThe story follows two girls who meet each other by coincidence:the extremely energetic and cheerful Papika, and the much more level-headed and all-round normal Cocona. The somewhat futuristic world which Flip Flappers plays out in does not only contain hoverboards and advanced robotics, but also a fair amount of less explainable things. Supposedly there exists a second, overlapping dimension called Pure Illusion which Papika and Cocona end up stumbling upon by literally falling down a hole into it. This other world is largely responsible for what makes Flip Flappers so different, because in Pure Illusion pretty much anything seems possible. It reminds me of Fantasia a bit with its magical, colourful landscapes, mythical beasts and other strange creatures, doors functioning as teleports, and just a ton of magic in general. Sometimes however it can be sci-fi-esque rather than fantasy-esque, with digital Tron-like cyberspace environments, mechas and more.\\n\\n\r\nPapika and Cocona work for the Flip Flap organization, which tasks them with searching for so-called \"amorphous\" fragments within the world of Pure Illusion, which are supposedly capable of granting wishes. These fragments can be found in different kinds of environments within Pure Illusion, which is largely what causes them to end up in such blatantly different surroundings in almost every episode. In their adventures however they end up finding out that Flip Flap is not the only organization on the hunt for amorphous fragments, as they encounter a second group who seemingly wants them for their own ulterior motives. And thus we end up with a lot of fighting in-between the two sides throughout the anime as they keep trying to beat each other to the punch for every fragment.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers utilizes the strange world of Pure Illusion in order to tell unusual stories on a mostly episodic basis out of chronological order, and on top of providing interesting adventures it also has a plethora of symbolism underneath the surface. Pretty much everything in this show has a meaning. However, not the entire anime is on an episodic basis. Towards the end, everything starts to connect, and an overarching storyline you might not have even realized was ever there suddenly starts to become visible. Ultimately, it all culminates into a quite grandiose and conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes Flip Flappers a success to me is that it manages to deliver its deeper messages without it really hampering the fun factor of the anime itself. A common problem I have with more philosophical anime is that they often end up feeling like nothing more than lectures and either turn out to be quite boring (like Mushishi) or just plain cringey (like Yuri Kuma Arashi). But Flip Flappers is actually a ton of sheer light-hearted fun on top of its subtle themes, like a child's imagination come to life with its execution, and even though there is generally way more to each scene than meets the eye, it is still very entertaining to watch. And as a result it actually made me interested enough in the show as a whole to motivate me to pay attention to the details as well, so in a way the fun factor actually made the deeper themes better too. It is the same reason you usually learn more from a class you actually enjoy than one that makes you literally fall asleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are overall quite likable but also very symbolic. Papika's bubbly personality is like a representation of childhood innocence, whereas another girl called Yayaka rather seems to symbolize adulthood, with Cocona stuck somewhere in-between the two extremes, unsure what she really wants to do. It's a nice way of combining character diversity with contrasting deeper themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value is also quite surprising. Studio 3Hz do not have much in their repertoire other than Dimension W and Sora no Method prior to this, but even so they still definitely delivered here. The art style looks incredibly hand-drawn, like something you would normally see in a Studio Ghibli film rather than something you would expect to see airing on TV. But it fits really well with the Fantasia-like setting of Pure Illusion, further enhancing the experience of magic and wonder of it all. And on top of that, Flip Flappers boasts with not just having one of the best opening themes of the entire season, but also quite frankly one of the best ending themes I've ever heard in anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, what you have is an anime which honestly does not feel like it has any clear weaknesses in my eyes. The unorthodox setting and story, the way all the dots suddenly connect towards the end, the diverse and symbolic characters, the gorgeous art and the enjoyable theme songs, it is all really good. Just... not utterly amazing either. I guess the biggest downside would be that at times the story will undoubtedly come across as rather confusing, even if you really try to pay attention. Granted, this is all intentional, but that does not really help much in practicality. However, as mentioned earlier, even if you will not understand literally every message that Flip Flappers is trying to convey, I think you should still be able to enjoy it quite a lot. When it all comes down to it, that is probably its greatest strength.",

            "content": "Critics call this series: \"beautiful, imaginative, action-packed, and mysterious\"\r\nI'll add that it's also \"diverse, unique, immersive, and, most importantly, it's (*cough*cough* mostly *cough*) coherent!\"\r\nFlip Flappers is pretty underrated and will take you on a relatively unpredictable journey with two middle school girls named Papika and Cocona as they travel to another dimension called \"Pure Illusion\". The story begins mysteriously as it follows the warm and simple-minded Papika as she escapes from what looks like a lab and flies off into the night sky on her hoverboard. It then switches to the perspective of the visibly depressed or kuudere Cocona and briefly gives insight into herstruggles to figure who she wants to be and what career path to choose. At this point, no one could have guessed the incredibly diverse future that was in store for these two protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nI strongly believe that Flip Flappers is one of the most original and imaginative anime ever made. It should get more attention because it definitely has all of the necessary ingredients to become one of the treasured gems of the anime genre. I highly recommend that you check this out if you enjoy diversity, unpredictability, action, and beauty. I usually like to contemplate anime, but this series was so unpredictable and silly that I had to turn my brain off for most of it, haha! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe concept of other dimensions gave this anime the ability to explore unlimited possibilities. Mechas, ghosts, sci-fi, action, comedy, horror--- you name it and it was probably in Flip Flappers. The overarching plot showcases the growing friendship of Papika and Cocona as they journey to \"Pure Illusion\" to collect rock-like-things that grant a wish once collected (kind of like finding the dragon balls). They eventually come to face opposition from another group that's also trying to collect them. However, ~PLOT TWIST~ things aren\u2019t really as they seem\u2026 What real-world consequences will their actions in Pure Illusion have? Do the rocks really grant wishes? Who, exactly, is Papika? In fact, who is Dr. Salt?  In fact... who... are you...? Just kidding, but these are some of the major questions that you might wonder throughout this anime. Overall, I did think it was a bit random (mostly in a good way) and sometimes the randomness strayed from the coherence of the plot. However, the pacing was, nonetheless, great and the stories/sub-stories were all interesting as well.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough the art was mostly simple, it was beautifully simple. The art was deliberately made to look simple and is one of the most colorful anime that I\u2019ve seen. It was truly a work of art! The motion was a bit choppy at times, but you could really FEEL the action. Pure illusion (alternate dimension) was absolutely stunning with rich and vibrant colors, and its artwork was enough to make me feel fully immersed in this series. The art wasn\u2019t good because of its detail, but instead because of its creativity. They did a great job on setting the moods of the diverse settings in Flip Flappers. Sometimes it goes from a fun and light-hearted mood to a sci-fi mood, and then to more darker moods. Although the art was really good, I never once thought \u201cOh... My... Fuck... BRILLIANCE! MASTERPIECE!\u201d like I did for Unlimited budgetworks (unlimited bladeworks) or Kizumoneygatari (Kizumonogatari) so I couldn't give it a 10 (Visit Kill la Kill or Katanagatari [10/10 Art]) for how to be flambuoyant, but still fluid in animation)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nEvery character\u2019s voice matched the character, battle sounds were great, and background noises were normal. The background OSTs were primarily cinematic and didn\u2019t have a memorable central theme like in Fairy tail, Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown, SAO, Madoka Magica, or Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles but it was nonetheless great background music. The opening was pretty good, but the ending was perfect for this anime. The ending was lighthearted, had an Alice-in-Wonderland-like feeling to it, and the artwork really matched the music perfectly. The sound was great overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\r\nI personally think the characters were the weakest part of this anime. All of the characters were cliche tropes that weren\u2019t complex at all. The story was diverse enough that it didn\u2019t matter much, but none of the characters were particularly unique in any way. It\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not sure how they could\u2019ve developed more complex characters with its diverse settings in a matter of only 12 episodes. Their simplicity didn\u2019t really take much away from the anime, but you probably won\u2019t be getting any new favorites from it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was pretty unique, so I think I\u2019ll remember it for a long time. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again someday! That doesn\u2019t happen to me often (I\u2019ve only really re-watched like 2 series). There was just something special about this anime that I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nIt was very unique, the story was pretty good, and it was interesting overall, but it could have been better. The story was also extremely diverse but consequently had some very minor inconsistencies. The artwork was creative, but a bit choppy. The sound was great and well-suited to this anime, but not amazing. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? Well, I totally recommend it personally but:\\n\r\nIf you value anime for its uniqueness, then definitely!\\n\r\nIf you like artistic anime, then yeah!\\n\r\nIf you like girl action anime, then yep!\\n\r\nIf you like sci-fi anime, then ehhh you might want to give it a shot...\\n\r\nIf you found the story or concept to be intriguing, then you should probably try it for about three episodes...\\n\r\nIf you dislike simple anime and tropes, then no because this anime is very simple and trope heavy.\\n\r\nIf you dislike \u201cfriendship power\u201d, then nah this anime \u201cFairy Tail\u201ded at times.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision! If it did, let me know by clicking helpful~ If it didn\u2019t, let me know what you disagree with so I can learn from my mistakes!",

What I liked on this show was it's subtle yet too vibrant and how it was incorporated with meanings behind it that you will not notice 23 minutes hadalready passed. Graced with beautiful art design, engaging characters,and some of the most consistently sharp visual storytelling, episodic themes where at times calm and subdued then comes a bombastic outing, even crazier and bigger in its scale it manages to break away from easy comparisons thanks to a tone, aesthetic, and narrative ideas that are so unique and engaging. Flip Flappers\u2019 storytelling and character writing goes completely unsaid. It's strong point was both character story and adventure , but it stands out as a confident, imaginative, and consistently beautiful example of visual storytelling done right.",

            "content": "Papika and Cocona. Remember those two names well. Flip Flappers chronicles the adventure of these two girls as they venture into a world known as the \u201cPure Illusion\u201d. For a girl like Cocona, this is a dramatic change of her life. Think about it though. If you certainly got dragged into a world of unknown, wouldn\u2019t you be curious, scared, or excited? Those are the sort of feelings I was expecting this show at first. It\u2019s expecting the unexpected.\r\nAs an original anime, viewers need not to worry about faithfulness related to adaptation. Also, director Oshiyama Kiyotaka puts his talent to work. For those who areunfamiliar with his resume, he\u2019s been involved with various projects pertaining with sci-fi elements. (ex. Space Dandy, Bounen no Xamdou, etc) As such, you should expect to see plenty of expressive ideas and creativity that he pours into Flip Flappers. The first few episodes seems to also draw influences from fairy tales such as Alice in Wonderland. However, the story itself is much different as the Pure Illusion world brings unnatural ideas to reality. The basic concept is two girls working for a mysterious \u201cFlip Flap\u201d organization in order to collect amorphous fragments. These fragments are implied to have the power to grant wishes. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, watching Flip Flappers began as nothing short but exciting. My original impression was something along the line of a magical girl series of cute girls doing cute things while trying to accomplish a goal together. That quickly evolved as we see how action packed this show can really be. The third episode will leave you in awe as the audience will be presented with a spectacular battle. It adds elements that can draw similarity from other popular works such as Mad Max or Fist of the North Star. For this reason, Flip Flappers breaks the mold of the usual cute girls doing cute things but derives into more of a surrealistic adventure. That adventure takes place mainly in the Pure Illusion world where many creative ideas are used. What makes their adventure special is that while it can feel crazy and wild at times, it retains the strengths of storytelling and at the same time updating it for today\u2019s audiences. The storytelling also gets more complex as we learn more about the main characters (specifically their past) and connections to the Pure Illusion world. The supernatural phenomenon and purpose of the characters will also be realized that easily can draw the viewers\u2019 curiosity frequently.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Flip Flappers can\u2019t shine without its characters. That\u2019s where our main protagonists, Papika and Cocona comes in. Papika and Cocona are sort of polar opposites on side of a coin. Cocona is a pretty serious girl who seems somewhat insecure about her future. She attends a school but is often cautious about people and events around her. It seems that she is often careful about letting others get close to her. This is the opposite for Cocona, a highly energetic girl who seems to be very interested in Cocona. The two develops a unique relationship as they explore the Pure Illusion world in all its glory. What I find most interesting about their relationship goes beyond just a charming character chemistry. Rather, it\u2019s how Papika\u2019s influence seems to change Cocona. She becomes livelier, sheds her initial reservations, and better express her emotions to others. It\u2019s also hinted at many times that Cocona seems to view Papika as much more than just a friend. To me, her character goes under heavy changes as she begins to realize her purpose in the world.  Remember, she was very unsure about her future but finds purpose through her character connection with Papika. On the other hand, there\u2019s Papika, the girl that always wants to get close with Cocona. She naturally tries to become her friend from the very start despite Cocona\u2019s cautious personality. From my point of view, she is like the light of that Cocona is searching for in a dark tunnel. She is able to open Cocona\u2019s eyes to a brighter future. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Papika and Cocona, we are also introduced to other characters in the show. Yayaka (Cocona\u2019s childhood friend) is perhaps the most prominent one among those introduced as she has a past history with Cocona. However, the most intriguing part is how her role in the show also has influences on Cocona. The way this show adapts character drama becomes more and more emotional as time goes on. Now, what I do have some concern with is the later stages of the series as more revelations regarding Cocona is revealed and those that gets involved in her life. The antagonist in this show may or may not be likable for their roles. It\u2019s also easy to say that while I do enjoy the character drama, it can sometimes feel a bit forced and thrown into the face of the audience. However, one thing is for sure. It\u2019s still pretty convincing way to explore human emotions. Jealousy, regret, apathy, compassion, loneliness, love, shame, acceptance are just a few of those. \\n\\n\r\nProduced by studio 3Hz, I have to admit, the show feels like something out of a fairy book when it comes to visual dynamics. It gives a very picturesque feeling with its setting that sharply contrasts between the real world and the Pure Illusion world. In fact, fairy tale allusions enter the show itself such as with the animal motifs and stylistic dresses. As more episodes progresses, there\u2019s even mecha that enters the story! That being said, the show\u2019s risks paid off for its visual quality and is more than just about being symbolic or unique. It\u2019s there to show that Flip Flappers stands out as a show on its own merits. Character designs and transformations may seem like a generic magical girl theme but retain its surrealistic expression. Speaking of expressions, characters convey that exceptionally well to display their emotions. Cocona is a prime example as this as she is the most human character in the show while Papika\u2019s goofy personality makes the series more relaxing and playful to watch. As I mentioned before, the battle segments in this show is fast paced yet precisely crafted. Think of it similar to FLCL or Gurren Lagann as it displays the talented directing of the staff. When in motion, it\u2019s when the action really becomes epic. There\u2019s also some fan service (namely an episode with swimsuits) but that really shouldn\u2019t hold you back from watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music offers a unique dynamic to the show as well. In particular, the ED theme song highlights the talent of Kiyotaka Oshiyama\u2019s directing as the lyrics has a balanced rhythm. The OST also offers a good balance between intense battle segments to the more emotional dialogues. This comes with character voice mannerism that is impressively performed by the voice actresses. I\u2019m mostly impressed at the two main leads \u2013 Cocona and Papika. The two are able to deliver their lines in such a believable way that it\u2019s just hard to ever turn heads away from them. I mean, who can ignore their iconic \u201cFlip Flapping!\u201d line?\\n\\n\r\nAh Flip Flappers, an underrated gem that some people may have overlooked this year. It\u2019s a series that brings fantasy to a surrealistic level in a world of unimaginable possibilities. The characters play their roles in a fashion that has meaningful purpose while always arousing the curiosity of the audience. Storytelling may or may not suit your tastes but I\u2019d still advise in giving this show a chance. It\u2019s too fun to pass up on as it proves creativity at its finest.\\n",

Flip Flappers is this to me.\r\nFlip Flappers is fun, original and refreshing. Believe me, watching the first episode and seeing Papika surfing in the air with her hoverboard is extremely refreshing from a lot of LN derivatives and High School Garbage I've the displeasure of wasting my time on. \r\nThen there is the superb animation, the surprisingly memorable musical scores, and the vibrant colors ties everything together for a splendid 20 minute episode of fun.\r\nThe plot is freshand imaginative, although watching this over the course of several weeks ended up making me hype this show up, I still appreciated the ending and overall plot in this series. It'll make you laugh, make you cry, and make you scream. It's one of the very few shows where I ended up liking most of the characters in it. \\n\\n\r\nAdding to that, the show has a surprising amount of rewatch value, little details don't get noticed unless you pay close attention and the show actually rewards keen viewers.\\n\\n\r\nIf there are any missteps, it's due to the pacing. Early episodes were slow but later episodes had erratic pacing. I would have preferred if the show was a 2-cour series, it would greatly fix most problems I have with the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what can I say? It's a great ride and I'm glad to be on it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the best I've felt since watching FLCL.\\n\r\n Reply",

            "content": "It's painful to see a show with boundless imagination be constrained by the cold, harsh facts like Flip Flappers. It's a beautifully animated show with an endearing, infectious sort of charm, but BD sales are the lifeblood of seasonal anime, and all the charm in the world won't count for anything if you can't make the grade. Flip Flappers struggled to find an audience, and you could feel the creators; mad-dash scramble to wrap everything by the end of the first and certainly only season.\r\nIf given the chance to stretch its legs and take its time, perhaps over two full-length seasons, I think Flip Flapperscould have developed into something really marvelous. The chance for anything like that now, however, is pure illusion.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has a great start. The artwork and animation is gorgeous throughout, full of liveliness and energy, capturing everything from fantastical dreamscapes to heated battles to the subtle, little gestures that are so often forgotten. That and the intrigue of the setting and the characters was enough to draw me in. I kept watching for the varied worlds each episode would offer; it reminded me of Space Dandy in that each setting felt like a chance for different artists to go hog wild and really let loose. Papika and Cocona are likable leads to boot, which always helps.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I also appreciated was the show's slavish devotion to showing, not telling. There's no narration, no characters explaining every step of their thought process (at first), it's all conveyed through the visuals and the way these characters interact. That can be all too rare in anime and should be applauded.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the last third of the show starts to cram in plot point after plot point, as if the crew realized that they were running out of time. We stop exploring these distant worlds and instead have to drudge through the tedious, infinitely-less interesting backstory. Characters show up with no purpose (NyuNyu). The characters we already have are pretty thin, with little depth or nuance to really explore. We have yet another \"small child with reality warping powers of a god running amok\" plot. Then the whole thing ends with so many threads unresolved at best or completely forgotten about at worst; Yayaka, who's friendship with Cocona is the basis for a powerful turning point in Ep 8, is almost entirely redundant by the end and gets no conclusion to her arc. The story doesn't end, it just stops.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame that a rushed end can damage an otherwise good or even great show, but that's why execution is so, so important.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, don't take this 6 to mean its bad. I would still heartily recommend Flip Flappers as a whole; it's breathtaking to look at and, at its best, it's a wildly fun and imaginative ride. You just have to take the show warts and all.",

Helicopter parenting is bad and when you try to protect your kid from everything it turns out *you're* the one hurting them! Only in Flip Flappers case the helicopter mom force feeds LSD to everyone to the point where the show turns into Inception and you're not supposed to know what's reality and what's Pure Illusion. It takes a lot of cues from Evangelion and that may be up your alley but it's not my thing.\r\nThe animation stays consistent in its style but there is a slight drop off in qualityas the show progresses. Music is fine, there are a few stand out track but the OP and ED stand out more than music used within the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go Papika is stagnant, Cocona goes through the standard 'I didn't want to do this/adventure but now because of friends I do!' arc complete with angst in the middle for \"conflict\", and Yayaka learns the true meaning of friendship. Pretty standard stuff all around. Salt isn't a character until the last 4 episodes, Nyunyu just never is a character, the twins (triplets?) don't amount to much but I suppose they had a slight character arc. The best episode in the show in my opinion was centered around a character whose name I can't remember because she was the focus of only that episode and then disappeared for the rest of the show and was only seen in the end as a nod to the fact that they took the time to design a character, remember?\\n\\n\r\nOverall pretty standard stuff, I was really excited for it in the beginning but it tripped over itself in the end and crossed the finish line in mediocrity.",

            "content": "If something makes you happy, excited, or sets off another string of convoluted positive emotions, it\u2019s kinda tough not to like. Hell, even things that makes you scared, anxious, or want to cry, emotions that seem negative in nature, are contributing factors to why you might like something. Think back to whenever someone tried to explain why they loved \u201cClannad: After Story\u201d with \u201cit made me cry,\u201d or think back to whenever someone told you why they loved \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d with \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop looking at the screen!\u201d The same can be applied to why people love those moe slice of life anime, itjust makes them happy. It\u2019s tough to beat emotion with logic, which is why Flip Flappers felt so damn successful. A world where anything could happen, the writers do what they want because they felt like it, not limiting themselves to a set of rules or principles, and goddamn, it was lovely. Every episode explored a new world, with new characters and a different sense of fun each and everytime. Flip Flappers understood perfectly well how to have a good time, and it was an absolute fucking blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of the fun can easily be destroyed in the face of an underwhelming ending. Flip Flappers was shaping up to be a wonderful series, but a sudden shift from episodic fun to an attempt at establishing a serious story changed everything. You could certainly argue that the final arc was what they were going for the whole time, while everything else was filler, but the \u201cfiller\u201d was still significantly better than the actual story. Somehow, even the absolutely gorgeous animation had suffered. In comparison to everything else, the final scenes looked underwhelming. This may seem like a silly criticism, but for a show that boasts visual beauty, it\u2019s disappointing when that beauty fades. Even then, I wouldn\u2019t mind if the story managed to stay on track, but it doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFun Beginnings\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers absolutely decimated my expectations. The cover screamed nothing more than another typical magical girl anime. However, it really is so much more. This series is about exploration, travelling beyond the unknown, and doing crazy things for the sake of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe series surrounds a middle school girl, Cocona, being carried away from her boring, mundane world by a very mysterious girl, Papika. Cocona gets introduced to this \u201cportal\u201d device that will allow her and Papika to travel to whatever world necessary in order to complete their objective. This objective is to obtain crystal shards, which Papika is having trouble gathering on her own, so she enlists Cocona to help her as best as she can.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven\u2019t seen the series, it\u2019s pretty clear that this is a setup for something of an episodic nature. At first, the focus was on Papika, Cocona, and their adventures (or perhaps misadventures) within all of these varying places. Every episode explored a new world, and each world possessed strikingly different themes in a wonderful attempt at originality. It\u2019s hard to confine Flip Flappers to one genre, because it tries so many things over the course of its thirteen episodes. A few examples:\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Papika ventures across a gorgeous orange desert in a battle to the death against a group of bandits. She was trying to protect a weak village of weak creatures, and when she squares off against their leader, she practically goes Super Saiyan, and you see the two zooming across the sky as if you\u2019re watching Dragon Ball Z. This episode is clearly inspired by the super power genre. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Cocona and Papika have to pilot giant mechs and battle with other giant mechs over the backdrop of a gorgeous neon city, destroying most of that city in the process. This episode is clearly inspired by the mecha genre.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Cocona and Papika get trapped in a school, where doll-like figures with giant black holes for eyes follow them around telling them that all they want is to be their \u201cfriend.\u201d This episode is clearly inspired by the horror genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard not to appreciate what the series was trying to do, as every time I clicked \u201cnext episode,\u201d I knew I was in for new. This was an absolutely wonderful change from what I had been used to. I was simply in love in with this sense of adventure.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Flip Flappers once again decimated my expectations, except this time it wasn\u2019t in a positive sense. The last third tries to give us a real story. It tries to wrap up what it had set up, and it wants to leave us on a good note. I could understand this, as having the series stay episodic through and through was probably a scary thought, so the creators might\u2019ve wanted to at least give it an ending. However, this final arc doesn\u2019t manage to be as likable as the rest of the series, and it really destroyed some of the fun.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nNot-so-fun Endings\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers loses its charm when the creators shift the tone entirely. It tries to develop the characters backstories, give everything some kind of relevance, and they finally tell us what the hell is going on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what it was aiming for, but it just doesn\u2019t work out the way I would have hoped.\\n\\n\r\nWhat had happened to Papika and Cocona in their lives is incredibly compelling, and genuinely got me excited. Seeing Papika\u2019s relationship to Cocona\u2019s mother, and how they were stripped away from each other in such a barbaric way gave me goosebumps. We also get an explanation on why they\u2019re searching for these shards, who the people chasing Papika and Cocona are, and why Cocona\u2019s life is the way it is. Everything was explained decently, and at the start of the serious arc, I was convinced that it would work out pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, where things start to get messy is when the series encroaches upon the conclusion. As Papika and Cocona draw closer, in an attempt to \u201csave\u201d each other, things become more about love, faith, and their \u201cbond.\u201d This sort of escapism might have worked before, in the mystical and whimsical portion of the series, but after giving us this serious, edgy, more depressing backdrop, all tension is diluted when it\u2019s solved so inconsistently. The goosebumps faded away, and I was left with an empty feeling. It didn\u2019t help that the animation started to take a serious hit. The final scenes felt underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the series. Not only the animation, but where all the previous fights were these epic unbelievable brawls, the final fight was more about hyping up a super-move of love to one-shot the final boss. Even if this was consistent with what the show was originally going for, the changing of the tone towards the end didn\u2019t help that they decided to transition back into what they were originally going for out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you disregard this, it\u2019s not like the serious arc was being handled too well to begin with. Sure, I liked some parts of it, but it didn\u2019t change that the writing started to get a bit messy, characters were acting inconsistently, and the story felt underwhelming with its attempt to dramatize everything. Seeing Papika and Cocona go from lovely, fun personas to this serious bunch with edgy backstories felt out of place. I started to get used to it, but then it did a complete flip and they went back to what they originally were. It\u2019s hard to be sure what to feel at this point, so all I could do was watch aimlessly.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers starts out wonderfully, giving us a taste of pure fun for the sake of fun. It does whatever the hell it wants in an attempt to excite you, and it really works. Where things start to fail is when they try to create a darker story, characters, and tone. The serious arc is unfortunately very underwhelming. Although it isn\u2019t bad, it never manages to be as fantastic as the series was beforehand. Flip Flappers really could\u2019ve been something, and I\u2019ll never stop being disappointed that it didn\u2019t turn out the way I wanted.",

            "content": "This show is amazing...if you liked Madoka or any generic anime that has an organization that won't tell the main character what they are doing or why they should be doing it until the last 2 episodes of the show.\r\nThe show's atmosphere drips with the depressing normalcy of Cocona's life. She's a realistic shy high school/middle school girl who just wants to live her life in peace. UNFORTUNATELY, a random girl shows up named Papika, who is one of the most unrealistically cheerful and positive plot driving characters ever. If you like that type of character then this is definitely a fun ride, if youwould prefer something more realistic, again Madoka like, then this show falls short. Papika might as well be immortal, or at least an inhuman freak who believes she is immune to death. Papika and Cocona are two of the lucky few who get to go to bizarre and amazingly inventive worlds the likes of which no one has seen since the Witch Labyrinths from MM... \\n\r\nAlthough the worlds are more thought out and unique than MM, they lack a sense of purpose towards the greater plot and are just a showcase for whatever random thing popped into the animator's head that week. The two girls go to these worlds, which may be quite deadly, for no reason beyond curiosity and a prize that neither seems to care about.  They desire the greater goal of getting \"a wish\" but they barely care about the 10 or so pieces they need in order to actually get the wish. Once they learn the organization's overall goal, it becomes even more questionable why they would help out the organization beyond the fact that the story must happen or there will be no show.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are very unique and purposefully cartoonish, allowing radical changes to their designs when going to different worlds. Unfortunately, the designs are easily the most interesting part of the characters. The art style of their shaded eyes reveal their lack of complexity and failures compared to MM. You might believe there's depth beyond their standard girlish antics, but in reality the character's emotions range from super excited to depressingly sad with nothing but boredom in-between.\\n\r\nThe story obviously is just going to string the audience along until the story becomes darker and darker where the leader of the organization reveals his wish that he wants to achieve and the girls must use the power of their love for each other to overcome whatever the \"adults\" have chosen to believe is the superior ideology.  There is an evil organization. They are barely explored and are basically just the villains from the anime Evangelion and Darling in the Franxx.(hooded figures who want to rule/warp the planet into their own ideal world bla bla bla)\\n\r\nIt is above the traditional, generic magical girl series, but only just barely and I pity anyone who has much higher hopes than a 6/10 for the show's run.\\n\r\nTo be fair, this is probably more like a 5/10, but my standards for stories right now are to at least break previous ideas of the genre and go in a direction that might be better than the ones before it.  For that reason I dropped it to a 3/10.  You need more than a unique art style to push the boundaries of what's expected in new anime.",

However, I kept watching and every new journey that unfolds lead to new things that continually picked up my interest. It eventually peaked and came to the realization that this show proved that ithas a lot of potential, albeit not all of them has come to fruition.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that fascinated me is the visuals. They are just hypnotizing as we are presented the world of Pure Illusion and how it contrasts with the real world. The animation is good yet eccentric at times with its bright colors and fast-paced scene transitions, like a constant attempt to grab the viewer\u2019s attention. It\u2019s honestly the main reason I didn\u2019t decide to drop the show early on, it\u2019s just a well-done eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting looks generic but it keeps on unveiling a lot of things, though gimmicky at times, as the main duo travels through the different faces of Pure Illusion. It helped me understand the characters better as it reflects the character\u2019s perspective. Cocona sees it as a nuisance yet Papika sees it as an adventure. Yayaka sees it as a long-term mission and the rest of the cast sees it as a mystery. This conflict aided the strengthening of relationships especially the two main characters who seemingly fight all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progressed in the second half, major revelations are being dropped one by one which caught me off-guard. The whole Pure Illusion started making sense with respect to what the objective of the story is. While I mostly received this as a positive thing, it\u2019s also problematic since the show decided to suddenly go deep into the story when it\u2019s been doing well episodically beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, the show has a lot of potential as it keeps opening these potential plot points by the episode. New aspects of the setting are being explored, the characters are starting to get fleshed out, and the story is starting to take flight with the real objective being uncovered. However, not all of them were addressed by the end of the show. There were a lot of questions and mysteries left to what the show was trying to offer. It\u2019s like we are presented these tasty ingredients prepared to be transformed into a dish, but the product feels unfinished. Nevertheless, the story remains solid enough to not crumble on itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Flip Flappers managed to go beyond my underwhelming first impression. It turned out to be one of the best shows this season had to offer. It\u2019s a show recommended to those who like cute girls dealing with fantasy elements with a bit of personal edge to it. Well-presented, consistent, cutesy, heartwarming, I think I already written enough trying to describe how a surprising delight this show is despite addressing a considerable amount of issues but give it a shot anyway. It looks nothing special on the surface, but you might be in for a possible surprise.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As with any type of storytelling media, the overall value of a show will be inevitably judged by how much the viewer makes out of it. And, if there\u2019s a show that exemplifies this idea of a viewer\u2019s dedication to enjoying something affecting their overall opinion of it, it\u2019s a strange little magical girl show from Fall of 2016.\r\nFlip Flappers is one of the most polarizing series I\u2019ve ever seen in anime. On the one hand, there are those who would defend it as ingenious and philosophically meaningful, while on the other hand there are those who dismiss it as cheap yuribait with a contrivedand unfitting final arc. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to be in the hate camp. But I won\u2019t be trying to defend the show\u2019s philosophical value either. I\u2019m simply here to explain the reasons why I enjoyed a fun little Alice-in-Wonderland-style romp through the mind-bending world of Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are quite simple to understand, be it for better or for worse. Three stand out as our main heroines: Cocona, a melancholic schoolgirl who desires to quietly lead a normal, safe life but often finds herself going on fantastic adventures; Papika, an energetic girl who seems to be the polar opposite of Cocona in almost every way, and Yayaka, a more mature girl who seems to be grounded in reality as is Cocona, but even less so susceptible to the emotions that drive Papika.\\n\\n\r\nSome fans have compared these three girls to the proposed three parts of the human psyche: id, ego and superego. This comparison would paint a picture of Cocona (ego) being pulled towards emotional, spontaneous desires by Papika (id) while simultaneously being pulled toward more realistic, colder motivations by Yayaka (superego). Now, there is no way to confirm whether or not the writers initially intended to structure the interactions of their characters in this way. However, it certainly makes for interesting and believable interactions, because the fact remains that, whether intentionally or not, the characters do reflect the psyche and the internal conflicts felt by almost everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest appeals of this show is the way that it embraces the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d style of storytelling. The first eight episodes of the show focus almost solely on Cocona\u2019s relationship with Papika, demonstrating to the viewers their characteristics and the clashes in their ideals by putting them in various fantasy situations that they\u2019ll need to work together to get out of. Because of how, as the viewers, we able to experience the girls\u2019 interactions firsthand rather than by being told about them via exposition dumps, the climax of the series when Yayaka starts to play a bigger role in the story feels much more meaningful than it would have if the show hadn\u2019t spent its first two-thirds introducing us to our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters, although fun, don\u2019t serve much of a purpose other than to provide occasional exposition or fanservice. However, each of them, no matter how small their role in the story may be, undergoes a complete character arc by the finale. All of their motivations and worldviews are explained through flashbacks, which additionally help us to understand their reasons for doing what they do and, more importantly, why Pure Illusion behaves for them in the way that it does. \\n\\n\r\nVISUALS - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the strongest aspects of this show is the visual style. The art is totally unique, looking very much like a strange combination of SHAFT\u2019s character designs and Trigger\u2019s vibrant, energetic artistry. The characters are drawn beautifully, and the landscapes of Pure Illusion somehow look even better. The trippy watercolors that blend together to form the backgrounds are stunning, and very well convey the atmosphere for any given episode. The dull grays that blend together during the \u201chorror\u201d episode set a completely different tone than the neon lights of the \u201cmecha\u201d episode, which feels altogether unique when compared to the infamous \u201cMad Max\u201d episode.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Flip Flappers is a show about differences in perception of reality, another thing that it does exceedingly well is conveying a character\u2019s emotion by showing what they can see. In one episode, Cocona and Papika are experiencing childhood through the eyes of girl in a dysfunctional family. When she walks in on her parents fighting, they are drawn very loosely, and they pulsate and distort, colors blending and changing to reflect the terror and confusion that this girl feels. \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers also likes to tell its story through the use of symbolism and optical illusions. Early on, a character shows up who will later be revealed to be a villain masquerading as a kindhearted woman. Her first few appearances depict her as the famous illusion that makes it impossible to identify whether the figure in question is a beautiful girl or an old hag. Later on, the show teaches us to associate two characters with each other by giving them the same clover crown at two different times in two different episodes. It even warns us that it will get darker near the end during the first episode, when Cocona and Papika huddle together in the unmistakable shape of a human skull. Even simple things like inconsistencies in reflections tell entire stories in themselves, and a sharp-eyed viewer is rewarded handsomely for their attention to detail. If you pay close attention, you can predict almost the entire show just by watching the OP.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation during action sequences is absolutely brilliant. The fights are characterized by colorful explosions and bright streaks of color as the camera does loops and flips to follow our heroines. My personal favorite sequence is when Cocona and Papika fall through a tunnel into Pure Illusion, and the lines of their characters and the colors of ear skin and clothes begin to change and flash in a total acid trip of gorgeous animation. There is a beautiful scene when someone explodes into clover leaves that drift through the air in a single spectacular shot.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the final episode, the Flip Flappers team ran into budget problems. Because of this, there is an obvious drop in quality during the finale, causing the show to just look \u201cgood\u201d and not \u201cphenomenal.\u201d But hey - Evangelion ran into the same situation, and everyone loves that show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, simply put, one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. The OP is very catchy, and all of the insert songs are memorable and fit the tone of the scene well. However, the real shining point in the soundtrack is the ED, which is not only easily the best ending theme ever, but one of the best pieces of music ever. Listening to the ED just once will give you a good idea of how the series plays out. It starts as a simple, upbeat song accompanied by little bubbles and other sound effects that fully immerse you in its musical world, but it gradually evolves into an epic, more-than-slightly foreboding and mysterious orchestral piece that sounds like something out of Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is a show about the Umwelt. The Umwelt is a theory proposed by a scientist named Uexkull (people who have watched the first few episodes of Flip Flappers may recognize Uexkull as the name of Cocona\u2019s pet rabbit). This theory states that perception of reality is different for every given organism, and that each interpretation of the same experience is just as correct as the next. This show takes the seemingly abstract and advanced concept of Umwelten and makes it much more accessible and fun by presenting us with a story about two magical girls who have the ability to jump into these realities created by other people\u2019s interpretations of their surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what sets Flip Flappers apart from other magical girl anime is the fact that, after jumping into these Umwelten (called \u201cPure Illusion\u201d in the show), what our characters do has a clear effect on the \u201creal\u201d world after they leave. Large amounts of the story are told through symbolism, and the viewer has to be paying full attention in order to get the full experience. For the first eight episodes, very little plot development actually occurs, or, at least, very little that is immediately visible. The final arc harkens back to everything that has happened thus far, and has the potential to catch the viewer by surprise if they got too used to the idea of being drip-fed a story. Flip Flappers draws influences from, parodies, and gives not-so-subtle nods to (some would even say \u201crips off\u201d) Evangelion, Mad Max, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, Alice in Wonderland, and Nausicaa, to name a few. I won\u2019t try to defend these influences due to the fact that they didn\u2019t bother me. The story was still a good one, and that was what mattered.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many theories as to what deeper meanings may be concealed within Flip Flappers\u2019 eccentric plot. One of the more obvious points is the fact that, as the story goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that Cocona and Papika are in love with each other. As Cocona struggles to come to terms with her sexuality, she is eventually forced to confront an over-protective mother who is less than pleased that her daughter is a lesbian. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Pure Illusion has been compared to the Dantean model of Hell by some, as various characters in the show state that Pure Illusion has layers, much like Dante\u2019s model. Symbols of Hell and similar concepts such as the Thinker statue, the Drowning of Ophelia, and a literal vision of eternal damnation populate the show\u2019s early episodes. Now, as I said, I\u2019m not going to try and defend the show\u2019s supposed philosophical value. But I will state that the entire series is very open to interpretation, almost as though it is the viewer\u2019s own Umwelt. I can\u2019t say whether or not this is intentional, but it\u2019s very enjoyable either way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be divided logically into two halves. As previously stated, the first half is about Cocona and Papika\u2019s relationship, and is very episodic. Some of the episodes suffer pacing issues, but nothing too dramatically awkward happens. Following the girls\u2019 ninth trip into Pure Illusion, the plot finally kicks in and the show starts to feel more deconstructive, or at least much darker and more mature. Similar to how the Harry Potter books get progressively darker to reflect Harry\u2019s maturing, Flip Flappers does the same as Cocona finally comes to terms with her sexuality. This is what has awarded the show with the most criticism: the ending. However, it didn\u2019t bother me, because I saw it coming all along.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to say here. I love this show. I would run home from school on Thursdays just to watch the latest episode, then lie down and ponder it for at least a good hour afterwards. I participated in drawing the great big thank you card that /a/ sent to the studio after the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is quite the enjoyable ride, for someone willing to keep an open mind and accept the show for what it is. It\u2019s unique and pretty, if nothing else. Give it a try, and see if it suits your taste. If you aren\u2019t sold by episode 5, it\u2019s probably not going to be worth your time. But if you\u2019re looking for something equal parts tender and intricate, this is a perfect choice.",

            "content": "When keeping up with 2016 anime, I would often watch a title with a nagging sense that something was missing - something I wasn't seeing that was keeping a show with a workable or seemingly exciting premise from being truly engaging. And yet, for the longest time I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on exactly what that something was.\r\nThen, as the year approached its end, I was shown a world almost entirely unlike anything I knew from that year. Suddenly, it all made sense! What was missing was surprisingly simple: a sense of passion - ambition! A willingness to take risks - to try somethingbold, run with it confidently, and, perhaps most importantly, to have fun along the way!\\n\\n\r\nThis key ingredient sums up exactly what Flip Flappers sets out to do, and for the most part, it delivers in style! It\u2019s not a show that\u2019s interested in playing it safe, running with the pack, or following the norm. It does its own thing in its own world. It remains committed to this and never looks back. Not only does it feel novel, but as it runs, it succeeds in providing something many of its contemporaries struggle with: pure, unapologetic fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe show immediately pops with a striking presentation style that is excellent for the experience it attempts to create. Anytime the setting enters the whimsical world of Pure Illusion (which it very frequently does), a vibrant and impressionistic colour palette combines with sketchbook character designs to create worlds which immediately pop out at viewers; smears and flashes of colour - the worlds themselves - comes alive onscreen through highly expressive and fluid animation, all backed by a suitably fantastical score. Whenever this show wants to sell a big set piece, bombastic moment or climactic sequence, it does so with ease, energy and expression filling every frame! These moments are exciting; often breathtaking, and they combine with a general livelihood and an ever-present sense of wonder and novelty to immediately make Flip Flappers a fun watch!\\n\\n\r\nBut such moments aren\u2019t the only things contributing to this anime's flair. The very nature of Pure Illusion - an abstract world which seems loosely representative of characters' inner states of mind - is a perfect fit for this style of entertainment. Flip Flappers can effortlessly realize just about any setting it wants without it ever feeling out of place, nor completely random. This is great for keeping the level of variety and creativity consistently high. With this, and since much of the show runs on a cohesive semi-episodic structure, pretty much any crazy idea the show comes up with can be successfully built up to, and then executed with gusto!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, when the main pair of magical girls suddenly finds itself in an epic high-speed flying surfboard chase to escape from a crazy torture factory, or a DBZ-style fight involving a mind-altering mask culminating in a meteoric final smash, it works like a charm!\\n\\n\r\nAll of this crazy not-quite-randomness is thankfully held together by a controlled yet dynamic sense of tone and pacing. Each episode offers something new - something fresh - and each one makes an effort to go all-out with itself. In addition, it all ties into a core theme of the show: that of identity. Pure illusion itself is an expression of this, and in terms of story, each episode for most of the series tackles aspects of the theme in a different and interesting manner. One particular highlight of this (and of the show\u2019s writing as a whole) came in episode 6. I won\u2019t say any more on the matter, but it remains one of my favourite anime episodes of 2016. Point being, the show has a sense of cohesion that keeps most of it from feeling too unhinged, and allows viewers to build up expectations that it can subsequently defy in any number of ways.\\n\\n\r\nJust a few episodes in, I was already preparing to crown this my favourite anime of fall 2016 by far! And... in the end, I definitely think this is a show worth watching, but unfortunately, it hits a few stumbles.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the strengths of the show\u2019s presentation and structure, the characterization is often lackluster. While the main characters aren\u2019t one-dimensional, per se, they tend to lack in depth or detail that could really make them interesting to invest in. The main duo of Cocona and Papika can certainly be fun to watch as they contrast with and bounce off each other, but this dynamic relies heavily on moment-to-moment chemistry and less on meaningful conflict or development. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t present. Cocona in particular does go through several instances of personal conflict and development - disagreements with Papika\u2019s adventurous ideologies being one example - but little of it, for Cocona or any other character, is presented with the kind of weight, importance or urgency to get a viewer eager to see them grow or overcome any difficulty. Similar things can be said for the rest of the main cast. As for the supporting characters, they\u2019re pretty forgettable, with maybe one or two exceptions (Again, I refer to episode 6). As a whole, the characters don\u2019t actively harm the show, but rarely do much for it either.\\n\\n\r\nOne may also notice many of my aforementioned praises apply to \"most\" of Flip Flappers. Alas, it admittedly falters a bit later on, and in ways that prevents it from ultimately reaching its full potential. Sometime around the halfway point, Flip Flappers had a change of writers, and it shows. I suspect the general direction of the story was either changed or left on the sidelines for too long, because when things finally start unravel, they REALLY unravel. And so does the quality of storytelling. As if from nowhere, the show decides it has a ton of plot to reveal, and is going to pick up the pace as much as it deems necessary to get through it all.\\n\\n\r\nHow much is that, exactly? Enough that all the viewer's attention is suddenly fixated on following this mass of new information and development, instead of actually enjoying the ride. Flip Flappers, which relies so heavily on its apparent simplicity and well-paced structure to remain grounded - to create its special brand of charm - loses itself to a degree when it comes unhinged. In its strives for progression, it sacrifices any chance to be reflective or create a sense of wonder and fascination, and it doesn't leave the audience much time to catch their breath either.\\n\\n\r\nThe result resembles a rollercoaster whose design was unexpectedly and radically altered partway through assembly. What was once a carefully-paced ride quickly becomes a tornado of loops and corkscrews and twists and turns one after another, and another, and another, and another, while the track suddenly becomes bumpier and more hastily-thrown together at the expense of rider comfort!\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost as though they got two-thirds of the way through construction and realized the track was too straightforward, so they decided to build THREE TIMES AS MANY CRAZY TURNS into the last third to compensate! \u201cWhat\u2019s that?! We\u2019ll make our riders dizzy?! No worries! We\u2019ve got them in the cart already!\u201d I admire the ambition, but Flip Flappers may have tried to tackle just a tad TOO much. Attempting to cram all the resulting plot development into 4-5 episodes was always going to be nigh impossible without the pacing suffering to a degree. If it had been granted a longer construction time and was a 2-cour series, then likely none of this would have been a problem, but regardless, what we got was, at times, a bit of a mess.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Flip Flappers doesn\u2019t completely lose its way during this segment. Even at its clumsiest of times, it never completely loses direction, and if one can keep up with its frenetic pace, the story can still be followed to a degree. In addition, its sense of expressiveness and energy remains mostly intact throughout, while the visual quality stays impressively consistent. And fortunately, this jerky ride still eventually reaches a fairly satisfying and conclusive stopping point (ending) so riders can steady themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOne final silver lining to the comparatively weaker third act actually emerges from the previous ones, and that is the show\u2019s knack for effective foreshadowing. For all the twists, turns and unexpected bits of information Flip Flappers eventually blasts through, many of them are actually built up to quite well. While a few things still feel a bit spontaneous, Flip Flappers as a whole rarely seems to haphazardly throw out its plot twists without some level of setup. I won't be giving anything away here, as even with the chaotic structure near the end, discovering these things can be fun to an extent. Amidst all of them, though, there was one revelation in particular that really impressed me with its unusual yet brilliant method of foreshadowing. Without giving too much information, one of the ways it hints at itself is through the very structure of certain episodes themselves, and the effect that structure has on the viewer. If that sounds rather meta, you\u2019d be right, but if it sounds like I\u2019m overthinking things, I can affirm I\u2019m not.\\n\\n\r\nIf only the viewer was a bit more invested in the character(s) involved. Then, perhaps, this revelation would have had more impact - beyond its novel execution - and indeed, the same can be said for the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Flip Flappers concludes itself as an imperfect but valuable marvel. It strides forth unexpectedly, as if from another other world, seemingly out of nowhere, to show what it can achieve! As a thematically varied audiovisual treat, full of creative energy, it possesses a rare, passionate desire to do what many series forgot how to do: to just have fun for once. In today\u2019s period of frequent anime monotony, Flip Flappers stands out as a welcome modern breath of fresh air; one that knows its strengths, and plays to them well. \\n\\n\\n\r\n- FINAL SCORES & SUMMARIES -\\n\\n\r\n* Critical Quality: 6.5/10 (Story - 6 | Art - 9 | Sound - 7 | Character - 5)\\n\r\n\u2013 Despite some late-game plotting and pacing weaknesses, as well as functional but unremarkable characterization, Flip Flappers excels where it counts. Its top-notch, vibrant, energetic presentation and consistent creativity really help it succeed.\\n\\n\r\n* Memorability: 7.5/10 \u2013 In addition to a strong sense of novelty, Flip Flappers knows how to craft creative and memorable moments and properly sell them, and does so frequently; it all gives this series a very unique identity.\\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment: 6.5/10 \u2013 My enjoyment was brought down a fair bit by the final third, which simply wasn\u2019t as engaging as the rest despite all the surprises and plot developments. But the \u201crest\u201d I refer to was definitely a fun ride!\\n\\n\r\n* Overall: 6.5/10 \u2013 Flip Flappers didn\u2019t quite reach the highs I was initially hoping for, but I still consider it a respectable series that achieved what it set out to do. Even with its setbacks, it has enough standout qualities to make it well worth watching, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone interested. One small warning, though: the ending theme won't be leaving your head for a while.\\n",

            "content": "Finding the hidden gem of a year is always the best feeling an anime fan could feel. In my short experience with seasonal anime (following seasonal stuff since around 4 seasons ago as of the creation of this review), completing this series was my reminder of why I follow seasons in the first place. Watching anime weekly provides the opportunity to try out stuff one would have never had given a shot if certain series were completed. I was really having trouble containing my thoughts for this series, which is why this review will serve as the way to express them. An anime who's nameis what I imagined the title for a soulless kids show would be... get this... Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Spoilers ahead. My overall thoughts can be found in the last paragraph for those too lazy to read, though I doubt this will be long anyways.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story of Flip Flappers can't really be detailed in much ways without getting into spoiler territory. MAL's synopsis for once does a good job at saying what this show is about (without spoiling), but it does not do the events that occur justice in every episode. The main character Cocona is an everyday middle school girl that encounters a red-haired, eccentric girl of her age (in a flying surfboard of all things) named Papika. Shortly after their first interaction, they end up in a parallel world where it snows 24/7 and giant white-haired mammoths are the norm. After a life threatening situation, the main girl's thigh birthmark starts glowing, she goes badass Super Saying and saves her (it sounds weird, I know). What happens next is a sort of \"episodic\" adventure between our main characters, with each passing episode embracing its random nature. Explosive sakuga action, fun comedy, the discovery of intriguing worlds, yuri undertones and an insane mix of ideas ensue. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I said this show is \"episodic\", there was a reason that I added it in quotation. This show does have a very linear plot. The reason I said episodic is because for the majority of the series, there's a huge \"where the hell is this going?\" vibe. At the end of each episode the viewer is left off with more questions than answers, wondering if their questions are going to be answered at some point. It sounds bad but trust me, the show shines its brightest when its setting things up. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is between two rival\u00a0 secret organizations who send out middleschoolers (the two main girls working for one of these two) to look for mysterious \"fragments\" said to being capable of granting any wish if all are collected. Pretty straightforward and decent, but I found the main plot to be way more uninteresting than the \"episodic\" adventure. Basically, in the last episodes, the creator(s) making this show realized that they needed to wrap things up and answer things, so they did the best they could do to provide a satisfying ending. The end result wasn't bad by any means, but it is pretty evident that they focused more on making this a fun experience rather than having a thought-provoking plot. This reminds me of my experience with Re:Zero, where I enjoyed the journey a hell of a lot more than the main story. The story of Flip Flappers comes off as simple and lackluster compared to the insane ride we were given during the first 9-10 episodes or so. Since the show has to explain what they have set up, the last couple of episodes changes focus to other side characters that are crucial to the plot, but far more uninteresting than the original duo. My wish is that Studio 3Hz would have an unlimited budget to keep making episodic adventures between Cocona and Papika who are the real stars of Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nPop-culture References:\\n\r\nIt is always very interesting when a show references other famous works in pop-culture. This show didn't just made one or two references to real life works (for example how 3-gatsu no Lion referenced My Neighbor Totoro and made it a running gag, which was pretty cool btw), the show literally has anything and everything that would make the show cooler. It's like the creators of this show sat down one day, wrote down everything they liked from modern entertainment and decided to add it to Flip Flappers. Some include the following: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, how they literally chase a rabbit through a hole like in Alice in Wonderland, Star Wars' Tatooine, Dragon Ball's transformations and fight scenes, Mad Max vehicles and enemies, mayhem like in The Warrior and the Sorceress, a little bit of over-the-top animation from Ginax, Jackie Chan fighting maneuvers from Drunken Master, every Magical Girl anime ever, every Mech anime ever, Power Rangers, and many more that I am too lazy to look for. The show even does references to historical people and groups, like how a character is named after a German Biologist Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll and how the baddies visualy are a carbon copy of the KKK (yep). Most references happen in the parallel worlds of \"Pure Illusion\" and seeing how unique and insane each look, I would have loved to see more, but sadly the anime has to come to an end and I am left wondering what other crazy worlds were left undiscovered.\\n\\n\r\nYuri Undertones/Exploring Sexuality:\\n\r\nFor those who didn't follow discussions for this anime as it aired, there were plenty of talks whether this anime was a commentary on the LGBT experience told through a middleschooler and the self-discovery of being queer. For example, in many instances the show seemed to hint at something far greater than just presenting how good of friends Cocona and Papika are. Camera angles, optical illusions dealing with perception, fanservice, and other methods of cinematography were used to hint of a possible relationship between the two main girls. Hell, there's even an episode where Cocona straight up questions if her love for her friend Papika is just that, a friendship. Being completely honest here, I got pretty excited when stuff like this occurred (not in a perverted way, baka). In my opinion there aren't enough anime out there that explore sexuality, and the ones that do do not explore it in the way Flip Flappers does. An anime that dives into queer discovery being told through the eyes of a teenage girl, plus adding kickass sakuga and fun comedy sounds golden in my opinion. The setup was there and the subtlety was present, so did it deliver? Well, it depends on who you ask. The show takes the route where if you do not want these themes to be a part of your experience with this series then you will be okay (except for episode 7 were the yuri reaches its highest point). The best way I could describe it (being the geek I am) is comparing it to an Easter Egg in a movie or videogame. It's present for those who look for it, and those who don't bother to look deeper will never know. If you are looking for something more than just undertones you will be dissapointed just like I was. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the yuri subtleties that were present, but I cannot help but end with a bad taste of feeling like I was yuri-bated yet again. My crave for them yuris will never be satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of Flip Flappers' best attributes is without a doubt its visuals. This show is full of impressive sakuga action moments that look pretty amazing when they want to be (holy snap epsiode 3 was impressive). Of course it has its still moments, but for the most part it is a visual extravaganza, especially when the characters are in the parallel worlds part of what is known as \"Pure Illusion\" where the possibilities of fantasy are endless. The character designs are good and my only nitpick is that I found the character's eyes to be too far apart from each other making them look a bit weird to me at first, but again this is just a nitpick that I completely forgot about later on. Colors are also used heavily to convey emotion and establish a mood. Fanservice is apperant from time to time, but it's not \"in your face panties and tits\", rather more subtle and tasteful which I can at least appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another thing that is worth mentioning. It is not the best thing I've heard by any means, but it does a great job at setting the correct mood. The opening and ending songs are permanently stuck in my brain until I die because they are catchy as hell (I'm listening to the ED as I'm typing this ffs). The opening especially is perfectly fitting for this series. Just take a second and go check out the OP and tell me it doesn't get you hyped to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nWhat makes Flip Flappers such a great show (apart from all the unique worlds) is the characters, specifically the main duo you see on the cover. They have very different personalities, Cocona being a rather shy, cautious and well-behaved girl that cares for her loved ones and Papika acting as her polar opposite, with the only thing that they have in common is their love for others and one another. This back and forth between two completely different people make for very interesting dynamics and comedic situations. The side characters are okay with some having more development than others, but overall there wasn't a character I disliked (except for that pink-haired scientist that is just obnoxiously loud and serves as an unfunny comedic character).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIn the end, Flip Flappers is by far one of the most underrated and overlooked anime of the year. It is a memorable story about a girl overcoming her difficulties, and this self-growth is portrayed through parallel worlds that defy logic and understanding. It starts out great and gets better and better as the series progresses. Unfortunately, the last three episodes take a simplified route at answering the viewers questions that were built up throughout the series and is not nearly as good as the rest. Is it a yuri? Is it a magical girl show? Is it a clusterfuck of ideas? I'm not entirely sure yet, but what I can say is that Flip Flappers is one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is one of those anime that craves a visual feast for the eyes rather than telling a cohesive narrative and developing interesting characters. This is rather an exception; Flip Flappers is a gorgeous looking anime. Brimming with strikingly colorful aesthetics of a whimsical fantasy world. The uniqueness of designing a fantasy world with different variations of its own world is a feat. Flip Flappers is all about visual presentation and it rightfully executes how that whimsical fantasy world can be. So why does this get a 6 regardless of the fact the anime has vast potential to be an underrated/hidden gem? Well, everythingelse was just overlooked and these overlooked aspect is what set apart of the cracks shown.\\n\\n\r\nCocona is our central protagonist of Flip Flappers; A quiet and reserved ordinary schoolgirl encounters a strange hyperactive girl named Papika, who finds complete interest in Cocona just from her nice fragrance or scent. Papika drags Cocona into an alternate dimension strayed from their normal one, thus began their wild adventures of what is known as Pure Illusion. Not much is rather further developed beyond Papika's blatant fascination with Cocona and Cocona's indecisiveness whether she likes being on an adventure with said clingy hyperactive Papika. Their relationship can be summed up into a yuri-bait connection that felt forced. Yes, it is explained why Papika acts the way she does in later episodes but it does come off obnoxious when we are reminded that she loves Cocona. The other side characters are either forgettable and uninteresting even the ones that are developed. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that Flip Flappers excels the most is the art design; the colorful cast of characters are very distinguishable and each episode have variety of art from cutesy and fun to gloomy and dark. The character designs are very adorable especially the main heroines. The colors pops or stands out to blend the aesthetics of the details in the background; a pleasing eye candy. The animation is also a noteworthy praise with intense heart pumping action. Although, the action sequences were just the icing on the cake. Nonetheless, the art is gorgeous to look at\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of an episodic adventure is really good set up of variety of different imaginative and creative world Pure Illusion has to offer. It can range from a sci-fi Tron-like cyberpunk city to a post apocalyptic Mad Max setting. These aspects are implemented within these world and takes a unique spin of these worlds like adding mechs and magical girl power-ups. However, the following final act is what set the bar low on the expansive world of Pure Illusion felt artificial than what was already established. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the major criticism that hurts the overall experience of Flip Flappers. The final act/climax was clearly extremely rushed and the lack of direction. Characters are randomly added out of nowhere and served no purpose to the plot, excessive amount of exposition dump and seamless explanations of the world, removing the sense of boundless exploration that Pure Illusion was set to establish in the beginning. At this certain point, the interest was lost and the climax was focused on the story than the random adventures. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think Flip Flappers is bad, far from it. The poor writing, weak characterization, and the finale suffers the show's potential of an actual hidden gem. I wanted this to be something special than other mediocre obscure shows yet seeing through the cracks cannot be overlooked. Still, the the uniqueness of Flip Flappers will always be the visual presentation and how it was executed significantly as an eye candy experience. Watching Flip Flappers only for the aesthetics is your main reason why it is worth watching. It is a fun joyride through wild imaginative creativity.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Updated 12/31)\r\nFor anyone who's seen the other works of Studio 3Hz, you'd know that they created Sora no Method, which spiked about a 6.7/10 on MyAnimeList, and continues to be criticized for one of the worst plot holes seen in anime. On top of Sora no Method, Dimension W, a Sci-Fi Seinen that got pretty popular spiked about 7.3/10 on MyAnimeList. Studio 3Hz didn't do Dimension W on their own, the did it in part with the studio Orange, and besides Sora no Method, there seemed to be no original, redeeming work that could make a name for this studio.\r\nFall 2016 rolls around, and withthe releases of several new fan favorites and a few new sequels to popular anime, Flip Flappers was one of the releases. Just like every season, there's seemingly one or two anime that get pushed aside and not really mentioned, and Flip Flappers is one of those anime. Does it deserve it? Absolutely not. \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is something totally different, a breath of fresh air in terms of animation, character, music, story, and setting. Every time I watched an episode of Flip Flappers, I felt happy, relaxed, and desperate to watch the next episode. It starts early with a hook, and it definitely keeps you reeled in.\\n\\n\r\nStudio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this fun, colorful, beautiful, and enjoyable anime with extremely likable characters, both protagonist and antagonist and even background characters who are hardly mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8 \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has a concept I've never seen portrayed in anime. The collection of \"fragments\" throughout the setting of Pure Illusion is both relaxing and will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The setting Studio 3Hz set for Flip Flappers is gorgeous and so flexible, so full of adventure and molds the story into something that's beautiful, enjoyable, and allows viewers to feel like they're a part of the world Flip Flappers portrays.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what keeps the story from the perfect 10 is that in the first 4-5 episodes, the story seems scattered and spotty. The execution of the story is weak, but eventually the hook that starts in the second episode with more story in Pure Illusion makes the story eventually progress like it should. The first few episodes seem to lack follow a plot that progresses later into the anime, it's more to show us, the viewers, the world of Pure Illusion, and the inhabitants and natives of Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story in the beginning would've started off with the story of Cocona's confusion about her life, and about her parents, and how she's started going to Pure Illusion after meeting Papika, then this score would be much higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has gorgeous animation and character and setting design that Studio 3Hz has never indulged in. To quote my friend, it has that \"Trigger\" feel to it. The feeling that reminds you of Kill la Kill or Uchuu Patrol Luluco. The animation is smooth, the setting of Pure Illusion is gorgeously portrayed and makes you want to pause so you don't miss a single thing it shows you. Even when the setting isn't in Pure Illusion, the art is still bright and colorful. \\n\\n\r\nEven when the ambience on the animation and color is turned down to a darker scale, like in some parts of Pure Illusion or at night time, it still pops out and looks gorgeous. The art is extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally my favorite part of the show is the sound and music. I'll be honest to tell you that the opening song and ending song are probably on my top favorite anime songs of all time. The music is just the right amount of hype to get the viewers excited for the episode that follows, and the ending song is peaceful and has the viewers on their toes desperate for the next episode, so they can experience the beautiful atmosphere this anime create.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the battles that happen are realistic, but also add to the added Sci-Fi genre Flip Flappers have, giving it that \"futuristic\" feel. That's what I love most about this anime - it's Sci-Fi, but it's not a Sci-Fi that's ruined with over-the-top cliches, especially in terms of the sound. The ambience and sound in Pure Illusion just hypes up the gorgeous setting more and more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Flip Flappers are unique and all differentiate from one another. We have Cocona, who later in the anime has more of an important role than the beginning, but is portrayed at first as an idolized honors student. Papika is a mixture of our comic relief, but is also Cocona's loyal, cute, and enjoyable partner. Together, these two take adventure into Pure Illusion, where we meet Yayaka, who is partnered with Yuyu and Toto. Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto prove to be interesting characters and great antagonists for our heroes Cocona and Papika.\\n\\n\r\nWith Pure Illusion being used in the first few episodes just to show off how this universe and world work, we are given a variety of unique and amazing characters that do not come back after the episode they're premiered in. Characters like Welwitschia would be amazing to see work alongside Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto, but is seemingly removed right after her appearance. Uexk\u00fcll, Cocona's pet rabbit, is given a good chunk of screen time in the beginning and is seemingly shown to maybe have an impact in the show, but never actually does a lot. And the addition of TT-392, or Buu-chan could've been done so much better. Buu-chan seems to have a lot of potential, but is easily manipulated and converts to whatever female antagonist is thrown at us, and seems to be more of a hinderance than a partner to Cocona and Papika.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\\n\r\nAs I've continually mentioned in my review, the anime's hook starts right when we're introduced to Cocona's and Papika's delve into the wonderful and gorgeous world of Pure Illusion. The anime is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to delve into the same adventures of Cocona and Papika (Studio 3Hz, Flip Flappers game pleaseee?) Every Thursday watching this anime, I was so excited for the newest episodes to come out that I would wait at the 30 minute mark before they came onto Crunchyroll just to watch them right then and there. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is extremely fun and enjoyable, and it's definitely my pick for my absolute favorite for Fall 2016.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.4/10 (rounded down to 9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI could not recommend this anime more. It's so fun and so stunning, Studio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this. \\n\\n\r\nWATCH. THIS. ANIME!",

            "content": "Dimension Jumping Magical Girls with a dash of a \"Coming of Age story\" and a paintbucket full of beautifully bizarre scenery!\r\nLA wants to get straight into it...so let's dive into the technical rabbit hole shall we?.\r\nFlip Flapper's plot format for the first 10 episodes goes into a \"World a Week\" kind of schema but using movie and anime references as it's settings, such examples being Episode 3 having Fist of the North Star and Mad Max Fury Road settings to Episode 5 having the Shining merged with yuri genre settings to even the meta-narrative of \"archetypes and HECK the MECHA genre in one episode. Eventheir transformation sequences harkens to Pretty Cure's transformations to the point it's oozed into their attack names. The plot format surrounds Papika and Cocona trying to find the the \"amorphorus\" for the FliFlap organization under the various omni-genred episodes we get for unknown reasons and another rival organization by the name of Asclepius trying to get it as well for the first 9 episodes. Really these early 9 episodes was to emphasis and develop the relationship between our two main leads of Papika and Cocona through going through their trials and tribulations of their relationship and most importantly Cocona's indecisiveness, they both face when going into the Pure Illusion worlds. Come episode 10, all the hints and the reasoning to getting the amorphorus, Papika in general, Cocona's involvement in all this, Pure Illusion in general all comes into full force, something LA wasn't HARDLY expecting. In all respects, this development isn't exactly new as the hints were their just subtle in it's approach and because of this, the plot twists come episode 10 were amazingly executed, what happens after episode 10, the omni-genred feature of self-reflection and coming of age story for Cocona for Flip Flappers quickly changed into a yuri shounen anime...seriously that's the vibe LA got after this development, but that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nPapika and Cocona are polar opposites for the most part and although it's an easy opposites attract what with Papika the hyper-always genki character who's rather clingy to Cocona, her mysteriousness can kinda be a saving grace to Papika (which was LA's perspective). Cocona on the other hand, is a strict, no nonsense character though she opens up halfway through the anime though she reverts or becomes confused by her relationship to Papika (quite frankly metaphorically visually shown in one episode). There is one other character, Yayaka who's a friend of Cocona but she's ALOT more that you'd realize and becomes a rather focused character by the end of it and her rivalry both in character and relationship to Papika and Cocona respectively really made an interesting character and really impacted the major plotline during the first 8 to 9 episodes, because of that she quite easily was LA's favourite character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other minor characters that do get their own development episodes but through LA's perspective is shown through some of the Pure Illusion worlds, the most easily noticable being Iroha Irodori voiced by Saori Oonishi and if you could interpret it, Hidaka voiced by Jun Fukushima. Once again come episode 10, a floodgate worth of character and plot development focus on many of the secrets of Asclepius and FliFlap comes into focus and essentially reigns in character development from the various characters surrounding these two secret organizations WHILE keeping Papika and Cocona's development simultaneously. LA really can't explain more otherwise it goes GREATLY in spoilers, especially one character development who's enveloped and connect to ALL of this. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, there are two notable seiyuu's LA has to take note of, Ayaka Ohashi as Yayaka and Minami Takahashi as Cocona, they both nailed their characters greatly as well as giving them a wide vocal range though Minami had stuck round with the indecisively shy vocals due to Cocona during the beginning but she like Papika's seiyuu M.A.O got better over time. On speaking of which, M.A.O as Papika was narrowly annoying due to M.A.O's constant hyper genki status throughout their adventures and both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi shouting each others name in a moe cadence gotten M.A.O a bit of slack, but seriously, both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi as seiyuu's definitely gotten better over time. The rest of the vocal cast was pretty decent though some had the inflictions of hyper genkiness that M.A.O had like Jun Fukushima as Hidaka and NyuNyu's voice actor (was uncredited as LA wrote this). LA thought the one notable from the minor cast would easily go to Welwitschia's voice actor Aki Toyosaki in voicing one of the episodic villains and MAN did Aki go hammy in this one!. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, LA quite easily loved both the OP and ED for this anime, but most definitely Flip Flappers OP \"Serendipity\" by ZAQ was LA's favourite OP for Fall 2016. The ED, \"FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP\" by TO-MAS feat.Chima added to the bizarre fairy tale book feel to the anime and at times during cliffhangars did bring in either a moodswinger once this ED arrived but nonetheless both OP and ED were great for Flip Flappers. LA doesn't have much to say about the OST in general, though it was atmospheric to say the most, but the OST and the sakuga used blended soo well that LA hardly noticed the OST half the time (though LA is saying this in a good light).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, as LA stated at the preamble, Flip Flappers is an outright sakuga fest of animation and it's the more fantastical and broad reach of atmospheric detail from the crazy landscapes of the desert to tron-like cities to classic architecture to the more creepy mansion worlds and fast frantic battles makes LA be reminded of an Alice in Wonderland meets Anime kind of appeal to it's animation. The character designs are \"exotic\" and color-coded for easy distinction, not to mention LA just loves the parallels in color brought onto Papika and Cocona, easily coming from how Papika and Cocoa's hair color swaps during their transformation sequences further emphasizing Papika and Cocona's relationship with one another. What can LA say for Studio 3Hz, but if the anime's plot isn't getting to you, the animation most certainly will.\\n\\n\r\nThe final three episodes if anything really did change into a cohesive narrative instead of the episodic BUT at the same time tying loose ends towards those episodic episodes and even call backs to them, this also gave a HUGE amount of character development to Yayaka, however she's a really heavy spoiler character in Flip Flappers overall, what LA will say is that because of these final three episodes, she herself came to her own realization and she became a very focused and 3-dimensional character. This also leads up to Cocona's own realization which comes in the form of the surprise major \"villain\" of the anime which brings themes of \"fate or your own freedom\" which again ties up loose resolutions towards both Cocona's adventuring with Papika throughout all the Pure Illusions to Cocona's relationship to Papika solidifying itself by the penultimate episode. As much as the narrative structure changed, it also helped that the \"episodic episodes\" lead into something much greater and just wasn't used to be \"filler-ish\" episodes which gets revisited at one point along with a few relational indecisiveness from Cocona to have a resolution but it also helped in the character development to most of the major characters as well. If there was but one flaw LA could see in the final arc was that it condensed what was the mystery and subtle background hinting to the bigger picture into a simple yet slightly complicated story with a villain who doesn't know any better (though again not a bad villain on that regards due to the circumstances) with only the major characters impacting the plot. What compensated all this was the weird and intensely fantastical final battle with this villain along with it resolving the majority of the plotlines, THAT was enough to satisfy LA with this kind of ending.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers' episodic omni-genred nature to quickly change into a simple story with a villain just to resolve all the mystery behind Pure Illusion, Papika and Yayaka along with Cocona's indecisiveness. Flip Flappers had a great thing going with it's fantastical Pure Illusion worlds and the romp and character self-reflection, \"coming of age story\" as subtle hinting as good themes coming from these wondrous Pure Illusion worlds, it stumbled slightly however once it went into a cohesive narrative and turning what could have been turned into an anime with a bigger picture into a simple story, but LA can quite honestly give a saving grace for how the ending was resolved along with that final battle, but other flaws such as it's lacking character development from it's minor cast but nonetheless, LA doesn't think Flip Flappers NEEDED to fill ALL basis to be a great anime, what Flip Flappers ended with was good enough not to get LA's scorn for. Yet still praise it's storytelling in the form of Cocona's coming of age story, brilliant animation, soundtrack and satisfyingly resolved ending.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is an original entry in the magical girl genre focused on middle school student Cocona and her interactions with the energetic Papika as both adventure in the alternate world of Pure Illusion taking on enemy creatures and acquiring magical powers from the amorphus gems that are left behind by the creatures when defeated.\r\nThe one thing that sticks out with Flip Flappers is its gorgeous animation when the series is taken over to Pure Illusion. The scenery of Pure Illusion offers up some rather creative and bizarre environments and enemies that Cocona and Papika encounter in their adventures that include a colorful landscape whereour two heroines start to develop rabbit-like characteristics and a gloomy version of their school that traps the two girls in a time loop. There are a variety in the types of threats that Cocona and Papika have to confront within Pure Illusion that allow for some variety in the type of choreography seen in action scenes throughout the series from a typical superhero-powered battle to even a mecha fight. The animation has some shortcomings with character designs looking a bit on the simple side for details in certain regards and some of the animated sequences looking a bit jerky with movement. But these don't detract too heavily from the rather unique presentation offered with Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nMoving past presentation, Flip Flappers' storytelling is mostly straightforward with focusing on Cocona and Papika's adventures. The first half of the series is mostly focused on the two girls collecting the amorphus gems they acquire from defeated enemy creatures, learning more about the world of Pure Illusions, developing their relationship, and crossing paths with a rival organization also seeking out the amorphus gems for mysterious reasons. There are hints dropped in early episodes that Cocona and Papika may have a closer connection than what it would seem on the surface. The second half gradually explores these developments (and what is revealed leads to a dramatic twist for the series compared to its more light-hearted mood) and the motives of the rival organization in question, which eventually build up to a climactic battle that tests the bond that our two heroines established with one another throughout the course of the series. The revelations mostly make sense when looking back on some of the hints dropped, though there are a few unclear elements to the plot that Flip Flappers regrettably does not address in its finale.\\n\\n\r\nMinor issues aside, Flip Flappers was still a solid entry in the magical girl genre having a creative alternate world that Cocona and Papika have their adventures in and offers up an engaging plot focused on exploring the bond and connections that our two heroines have with one another. A solid recommendation if you are a fan of magical girl titles.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is without a doubt eye-pleasing. The first half of the series is intuitive, spontaneous, and entertaining. At first, the story is confusing. It's not clear what you're watching but makes you connect the dots as you watch more. For one thing though, the animation is superb. \r\nThe themes are not clear cut, they're actually quite ambiguous. The show's themes require you to think a little bit and piece it together which can be challenging but interesting. It makes you think and each scene is meticulously made to probe thought. But as you watch more you'll find the themes resonate more as a coming-of-agestory surrounding the main character, Cocona such as gaining independence and exploring your place in the world and identifying who you in relationship to the people around you. \\n\r\nUnless you wanted this theme explicit to you, then this may not be the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, this anime relies on animation a lot to help the audience make inferences about the story and drive the momentum of the story. However, this also means that the characters are not fleshed out enough. I feel like the show had a lot of opportunities to grow their characters more but a lot of them are left without actual substance to the story. For instance, there are a few characters that come up that are seemingly important but if you were to think of their contribution to the anime as a whole, that importance may not be there. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the pacing of the anime is confusing (perhaps re-watching might change my mind about this). The first half of the series is a slow-build and it gets more intense towards the last 4-5 episodes. But as the series goes into the end, the story becomes messy and there's a lot of information thrown at you which can be overwhelming. Surprisingly enough, the animation quality is still consistent. But, there's quite a number of plot holes and ongoing questions that the anime fails to answer or give closure. There is some attempt to answer these questions but it's still very ambiguous episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the the series is highly commendable. It's intuitive, fun, and very eye-pleasing. The use of colors and animation is superb and impressively consistent. An ongoing problem with the show is that there's a plot holes in most of the episodes (probably due to their heavy reliance on using animation to tell the story) and become more frequent in the end of the series. However the ambiguity makes you think and urges you to piece it together. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, there is a tendency of throwing too much information at the audience especially towards the end of the series. The characters are not fleshed out that much but perhaps this was done intentionally to probe that \"coming-of-age\" theme.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, I would urge anyone to watch this anime. It's entertaining, amusing, thought-provoking, and fun-loving. Give Flip Flappers a chance!\\n\\n\r\n(Review subject to change after rewatching)",

            "content": "To be honest Flip Flappers should-be more popular. I felt that it had all the material needed to engage with audiences regardless of their preferences, and most importantly sell great merchandise. The only thing that stopped me from giving the incredible piece of art a solid 10 was the strange and often times confusing story; which I'll get into in a moment so please keep sitting in your chair, or levitating above, you wizards.\r\nSo what is Flip Flappers about? Why should you be watching it? Can you eat it? Only two of the three questions above will be answered.\r\nFlip Flappers\u2019 story is interesting in manyways. We follow the lives two cute girls, there\u2019s intense action, amazing visuals, a yuri undertone lurking. What more could you want\u2014 other than nudity, perv. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story can be hit or miss depending on your preferences. If you\u2019re into simple story-telling and plot developments then Flip flappers most likely won\u2019t be on your watch list. The plot, the real plot, not fan-service is very confusing at times. It is so bad to the point where I found myself questioning \u201cwhat the hell going on?\u201d in certain episodes. You see, Flip Flappers method of storytelling is hard to follow\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThere are often times too many distractions, mostly imagery, that if you miss a single detail then you will be momentarily confused as to what is happening in the story. This is extremely prevalent when there are scenes filled to the brim with dialogue and monologues. Personally, I found myself getting lost in the vibrant imagery or special effects while characters were talking. Now as far as the story telling goes, the \u201cdirection\u201d I have to say that I strongly believe that both the narrative was straight forward as to be expected. Flip Flappers method of storytelling is \u201cthe hero\u2019s journey.\u201d For example, think of movies like Harry potter or Lord of the rings. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who are unfamiliar with the scenario, something bad or out of the ordinary happens. This causes the girls to go on an adventure to solve the problem; they receive supernatural aid, and get just a bit of character development. As their adventure progresses, they run into the antagonist whom they proceed to do battle with. At this point, \u201cdeath & rebirth\u201d kicks in. The girls lose, but suddenly realize that this battle is important, plot armor kicks in, and they both gain some sort of supernatural ability that helps them defeat the antagonist. After the grueling battle rests, a predictable outcome, the heroes succeed and head back home where everything is nice and happy.\\n\\n\r\nNow with \u201cthe journey \u201cthat the girls go on. It is not incredible but it sure is unique. During the span of the entire series Papika and Cocnoa are involved in some type of journey that teaches them both lessons. For example they both need each other. They\u2019re friends! Most of the problems the two have to fix during the series, I perceived them as stepping blocks for the two to continue building their budding relationship.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s never a dull moment in the Flip Flappers\u2019 story I feel like it provided more than enough entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, depending on if you have a good eye or are just really experienced with watching anime. One would assume Gainax worked this title with its unique choices in art. However, they didn\u2019t (as far as my knowledge goes) do much in the animation department. The credits in episode 11 say that they were used for outsourcing. This is common in the anime industry. Personally I believe that their unique art style was used as inspiration for 3hz. \\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds are beautiful despite lacking detail and high quality at times. Character designs are unique, cute which is most important. On the other hand, the animation wasn\u2019t as impressive. I felt like there could\u2019ve been improvements to the aesthetics and quality to make the show look more modern. HOWEVER! And Honestly, I think everything worked out. I enjoyed the beauty the show had to offer. It has a sort of \u201cdreamscape\u201d fantasy design to it. This choice fits with the theme of the show. Lastly, the colors are rich and the special effects are fluid.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does an excellent job setting the mood for certain situations. I felt that the composer did a wonderful job of creating songs that fit theme of the show. Happy, jaunty, tunes, the bells are of course the most important part. Voice acting was good to say the least. I didn't feel like the actors were anything special. The opening and ending song... Scratch the opening song. The ending song perfectly describes what the show is about! the sound director deserves to be acknowledge for their contributions to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: Flip flappers deserves some notoriety for its great efforts and contributions to the fall 2016 season. I felt that this title was incredibly fun to watch! The characters, art, soundtrack and story. There was so many things that I liked in the show that made it enjoyable. I had to give Flip Flappers a solid 9/10 because of how great I felt watching everything unfold.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is the textbook definition of a hidden gem. A short, artistic original anime by a relatively unknown studio, and also an anime which is quite difficult to explain. This is partially because of its symbolic themes, but also because the execution itself is very unorthodox. It is like the anime equivalent of an LSD trip; something I can only describe as a crossover of FLCL and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita. But somehow, Studio 3Hz actually made it work, resulting in what I would probably have to consider my favorite anime of Fall 2016.\r\nThe story follows two girls who meet each other by coincidence:the extremely energetic and cheerful Papika, and the much more level-headed and all-round normal Cocona. The somewhat futuristic world which Flip Flappers plays out in does not only contain hoverboards and advanced robotics, but also a fair amount of less explainable things. Supposedly there exists a second, overlapping dimension called Pure Illusion which Papika and Cocona end up stumbling upon by literally falling down a hole into it. This other world is largely responsible for what makes Flip Flappers so different, because in Pure Illusion pretty much anything seems possible. It reminds me of Fantasia a bit with its magical, colourful landscapes, mythical beasts and other strange creatures, doors functioning as teleports, and just a ton of magic in general. Sometimes however it can be sci-fi-esque rather than fantasy-esque, with digital Tron-like cyberspace environments, mechas and more.\\n\\n\r\nPapika and Cocona work for the Flip Flap organization, which tasks them with searching for so-called \"amorphous\" fragments within the world of Pure Illusion, which are supposedly capable of granting wishes. These fragments can be found in different kinds of environments within Pure Illusion, which is largely what causes them to end up in such blatantly different surroundings in almost every episode. In their adventures however they end up finding out that Flip Flap is not the only organization on the hunt for amorphous fragments, as they encounter a second group who seemingly wants them for their own ulterior motives. And thus we end up with a lot of fighting in-between the two sides throughout the anime as they keep trying to beat each other to the punch for every fragment.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers utilizes the strange world of Pure Illusion in order to tell unusual stories on a mostly episodic basis out of chronological order, and on top of providing interesting adventures it also has a plethora of symbolism underneath the surface. Pretty much everything in this show has a meaning. However, not the entire anime is on an episodic basis. Towards the end, everything starts to connect, and an overarching storyline you might not have even realized was ever there suddenly starts to become visible. Ultimately, it all culminates into a quite grandiose and conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really makes Flip Flappers a success to me is that it manages to deliver its deeper messages without it really hampering the fun factor of the anime itself. A common problem I have with more philosophical anime is that they often end up feeling like nothing more than lectures and either turn out to be quite boring (like Mushishi) or just plain cringey (like Yuri Kuma Arashi). But Flip Flappers is actually a ton of sheer light-hearted fun on top of its subtle themes, like a child's imagination come to life with its execution, and even though there is generally way more to each scene than meets the eye, it is still very entertaining to watch. And as a result it actually made me interested enough in the show as a whole to motivate me to pay attention to the details as well, so in a way the fun factor actually made the deeper themes better too. It is the same reason you usually learn more from a class you actually enjoy than one that makes you literally fall asleep.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are overall quite likable but also very symbolic. Papika's bubbly personality is like a representation of childhood innocence, whereas another girl called Yayaka rather seems to symbolize adulthood, with Cocona stuck somewhere in-between the two extremes, unsure what she really wants to do. It's a nice way of combining character diversity with contrasting deeper themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe production value is also quite surprising. Studio 3Hz do not have much in their repertoire other than Dimension W and Sora no Method prior to this, but even so they still definitely delivered here. The art style looks incredibly hand-drawn, like something you would normally see in a Studio Ghibli film rather than something you would expect to see airing on TV. But it fits really well with the Fantasia-like setting of Pure Illusion, further enhancing the experience of magic and wonder of it all. And on top of that, Flip Flappers boasts with not just having one of the best opening themes of the entire season, but also quite frankly one of the best ending themes I've ever heard in anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, what you have is an anime which honestly does not feel like it has any clear weaknesses in my eyes. The unorthodox setting and story, the way all the dots suddenly connect towards the end, the diverse and symbolic characters, the gorgeous art and the enjoyable theme songs, it is all really good. Just... not utterly amazing either. I guess the biggest downside would be that at times the story will undoubtedly come across as rather confusing, even if you really try to pay attention. Granted, this is all intentional, but that does not really help much in practicality. However, as mentioned earlier, even if you will not understand literally every message that Flip Flappers is trying to convey, I think you should still be able to enjoy it quite a lot. When it all comes down to it, that is probably its greatest strength.",

The story begins mysteriously as it follows the warm and simple-minded Papika as she escapes from what looks like a lab and flies off into the night sky on her hoverboard. It then switches to the perspective of the visibly depressed or kuudere Cocona and briefly gives insight into herstruggles to figure who she wants to be and what career path to choose. At this point, no one could have guessed the incredibly diverse future that was in store for these two protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nI strongly believe that Flip Flappers is one of the most original and imaginative anime ever made. It should get more attention because it definitely has all of the necessary ingredients to become one of the treasured gems of the anime genre. I highly recommend that you check this out if you enjoy diversity, unpredictability, action, and beauty. I usually like to contemplate anime, but this series was so unpredictable and silly that I had to turn my brain off for most of it, haha! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe concept of other dimensions gave this anime the ability to explore unlimited possibilities. Mechas, ghosts, sci-fi, action, comedy, horror--- you name it and it was probably in Flip Flappers. The overarching plot showcases the growing friendship of Papika and Cocona as they journey to \"Pure Illusion\" to collect rock-like-things that grant a wish once collected (kind of like finding the dragon balls). They eventually come to face opposition from another group that's also trying to collect them. However, ~PLOT TWIST~ things aren\u2019t really as they seem\u2026 What real-world consequences will their actions in Pure Illusion have? Do the rocks really grant wishes? Who, exactly, is Papika? In fact, who is Dr. Salt?  In fact... who... are you...? Just kidding, but these are some of the major questions that you might wonder throughout this anime. Overall, I did think it was a bit random (mostly in a good way) and sometimes the randomness strayed from the coherence of the plot. However, the pacing was, nonetheless, great and the stories/sub-stories were all interesting as well.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAlthough the art was mostly simple, it was beautifully simple. The art was deliberately made to look simple and is one of the most colorful anime that I\u2019ve seen. It was truly a work of art! The motion was a bit choppy at times, but you could really FEEL the action. Pure illusion (alternate dimension) was absolutely stunning with rich and vibrant colors, and its artwork was enough to make me feel fully immersed in this series. The art wasn\u2019t good because of its detail, but instead because of its creativity. They did a great job on setting the moods of the diverse settings in Flip Flappers. Sometimes it goes from a fun and light-hearted mood to a sci-fi mood, and then to more darker moods. Although the art was really good, I never once thought \u201cOh... My... Fuck... BRILLIANCE! MASTERPIECE!\u201d like I did for Unlimited budgetworks (unlimited bladeworks) or Kizumoneygatari (Kizumonogatari) so I couldn't give it a 10 (Visit Kill la Kill or Katanagatari [10/10 Art]) for how to be flambuoyant, but still fluid in animation)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nEvery character\u2019s voice matched the character, battle sounds were great, and background noises were normal. The background OSTs were primarily cinematic and didn\u2019t have a memorable central theme like in Fairy tail, Kill la Kill, Guilty Crown, SAO, Madoka Magica, or Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles but it was nonetheless great background music. The opening was pretty good, but the ending was perfect for this anime. The ending was lighthearted, had an Alice-in-Wonderland-like feeling to it, and the artwork really matched the music perfectly. The sound was great overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\r\nI personally think the characters were the weakest part of this anime. All of the characters were cliche tropes that weren\u2019t complex at all. The story was diverse enough that it didn\u2019t matter much, but none of the characters were particularly unique in any way. It\u2019s fine because I\u2019m not sure how they could\u2019ve developed more complex characters with its diverse settings in a matter of only 12 episodes. Their simplicity didn\u2019t really take much away from the anime, but you probably won\u2019t be getting any new favorites from it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was pretty unique, so I think I\u2019ll remember it for a long time. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again someday! That doesn\u2019t happen to me often (I\u2019ve only really re-watched like 2 series). There was just something special about this anime that I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nIt was very unique, the story was pretty good, and it was interesting overall, but it could have been better. The story was also extremely diverse but consequently had some very minor inconsistencies. The artwork was creative, but a bit choppy. The sound was great and well-suited to this anime, but not amazing. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this anime? Well, I totally recommend it personally but:\\n\r\nIf you value anime for its uniqueness, then definitely!\\n\r\nIf you like artistic anime, then yeah!\\n\r\nIf you like girl action anime, then yep!\\n\r\nIf you like sci-fi anime, then ehhh you might want to give it a shot...\\n\r\nIf you found the story or concept to be intriguing, then you should probably try it for about three episodes...\\n\r\nIf you dislike simple anime and tropes, then no because this anime is very simple and trope heavy.\\n\r\nIf you dislike \u201cfriendship power\u201d, then nah this anime \u201cFairy Tail\u201ded at times.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision!

What I liked on this show was it's subtle yet too vibrant and how it was incorporated with meanings behind it that you will not notice 23 minutes hadalready passed. Graced with beautiful art design, engaging characters,and some of the most consistently sharp visual storytelling, episodic themes where at times calm and subdued then comes a bombastic outing, even crazier and bigger in its scale it manages to break away from easy comparisons thanks to a tone, aesthetic, and narrative ideas that are so unique and engaging. Flip Flappers\u2019 storytelling and character writing goes completely unsaid. It's strong point was both character story and adventure , but it stands out as a confident, imaginative, and consistently beautiful example of visual storytelling done right.",

            "content": "Papika and Cocona. Remember those two names well. Flip Flappers chronicles the adventure of these two girls as they venture into a world known as the \u201cPure Illusion\u201d. For a girl like Cocona, this is a dramatic change of her life. Think about it though. If you certainly got dragged into a world of unknown, wouldn\u2019t you be curious, scared, or excited? Those are the sort of feelings I was expecting this show at first. It\u2019s expecting the unexpected.\r\nAs an original anime, viewers need not to worry about faithfulness related to adaptation. Also, director Oshiyama Kiyotaka puts his talent to work. For those who areunfamiliar with his resume, he\u2019s been involved with various projects pertaining with sci-fi elements. (ex. Space Dandy, Bounen no Xamdou, etc) As such, you should expect to see plenty of expressive ideas and creativity that he pours into Flip Flappers. The first few episodes seems to also draw influences from fairy tales such as Alice in Wonderland. However, the story itself is much different as the Pure Illusion world brings unnatural ideas to reality. The basic concept is two girls working for a mysterious \u201cFlip Flap\u201d organization in order to collect amorphous fragments. These fragments are implied to have the power to grant wishes. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, watching Flip Flappers began as nothing short but exciting. My original impression was something along the line of a magical girl series of cute girls doing cute things while trying to accomplish a goal together. That quickly evolved as we see how action packed this show can really be. The third episode will leave you in awe as the audience will be presented with a spectacular battle. It adds elements that can draw similarity from other popular works such as Mad Max or Fist of the North Star. For this reason, Flip Flappers breaks the mold of the usual cute girls doing cute things but derives into more of a surrealistic adventure. That adventure takes place mainly in the Pure Illusion world where many creative ideas are used. What makes their adventure special is that while it can feel crazy and wild at times, it retains the strengths of storytelling and at the same time updating it for today\u2019s audiences. The storytelling also gets more complex as we learn more about the main characters (specifically their past) and connections to the Pure Illusion world. The supernatural phenomenon and purpose of the characters will also be realized that easily can draw the viewers\u2019 curiosity frequently.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Flip Flappers can\u2019t shine without its characters. That\u2019s where our main protagonists, Papika and Cocona comes in. Papika and Cocona are sort of polar opposites on side of a coin. Cocona is a pretty serious girl who seems somewhat insecure about her future. She attends a school but is often cautious about people and events around her. It seems that she is often careful about letting others get close to her. This is the opposite for Cocona, a highly energetic girl who seems to be very interested in Cocona. The two develops a unique relationship as they explore the Pure Illusion world in all its glory. What I find most interesting about their relationship goes beyond just a charming character chemistry. Rather, it\u2019s how Papika\u2019s influence seems to change Cocona. She becomes livelier, sheds her initial reservations, and better express her emotions to others. It\u2019s also hinted at many times that Cocona seems to view Papika as much more than just a friend. To me, her character goes under heavy changes as she begins to realize her purpose in the world.  Remember, she was very unsure about her future but finds purpose through her character connection with Papika. On the other hand, there\u2019s Papika, the girl that always wants to get close with Cocona. She naturally tries to become her friend from the very start despite Cocona\u2019s cautious personality. From my point of view, she is like the light of that Cocona is searching for in a dark tunnel. She is able to open Cocona\u2019s eyes to a brighter future. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Papika and Cocona, we are also introduced to other characters in the show. Yayaka (Cocona\u2019s childhood friend) is perhaps the most prominent one among those introduced as she has a past history with Cocona. However, the most intriguing part is how her role in the show also has influences on Cocona. The way this show adapts character drama becomes more and more emotional as time goes on. Now, what I do have some concern with is the later stages of the series as more revelations regarding Cocona is revealed and those that gets involved in her life. The antagonist in this show may or may not be likable for their roles. It\u2019s also easy to say that while I do enjoy the character drama, it can sometimes feel a bit forced and thrown into the face of the audience. However, one thing is for sure. It\u2019s still pretty convincing way to explore human emotions. Jealousy, regret, apathy, compassion, loneliness, love, shame, acceptance are just a few of those. \\n\\n\r\nProduced by studio 3Hz, I have to admit, the show feels like something out of a fairy book when it comes to visual dynamics. It gives a very picturesque feeling with its setting that sharply contrasts between the real world and the Pure Illusion world. In fact, fairy tale allusions enter the show itself such as with the animal motifs and stylistic dresses. As more episodes progresses, there\u2019s even mecha that enters the story! That being said, the show\u2019s risks paid off for its visual quality and is more than just about being symbolic or unique. It\u2019s there to show that Flip Flappers stands out as a show on its own merits. Character designs and transformations may seem like a generic magical girl theme but retain its surrealistic expression. Speaking of expressions, characters convey that exceptionally well to display their emotions. Cocona is a prime example as this as she is the most human character in the show while Papika\u2019s goofy personality makes the series more relaxing and playful to watch. As I mentioned before, the battle segments in this show is fast paced yet precisely crafted. Think of it similar to FLCL or Gurren Lagann as it displays the talented directing of the staff. When in motion, it\u2019s when the action really becomes epic. There\u2019s also some fan service (namely an episode with swimsuits) but that really shouldn\u2019t hold you back from watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music offers a unique dynamic to the show as well. In particular, the ED theme song highlights the talent of Kiyotaka Oshiyama\u2019s directing as the lyrics has a balanced rhythm. The OST also offers a good balance between intense battle segments to the more emotional dialogues. This comes with character voice mannerism that is impressively performed by the voice actresses. I\u2019m mostly impressed at the two main leads \u2013 Cocona and Papika. The two are able to deliver their lines in such a believable way that it\u2019s just hard to ever turn heads away from them. I mean, who can ignore their iconic \u201cFlip Flapping!\u201d line?\\n\\n\r\nAh Flip Flappers, an underrated gem that some people may have overlooked this year. It\u2019s a series that brings fantasy to a surrealistic level in a world of unimaginable possibilities. The characters play their roles in a fashion that has meaningful purpose while always arousing the curiosity of the audience. Storytelling may or may not suit your tastes but I\u2019d still advise in giving this show a chance. It\u2019s too fun to pass up on as it proves creativity at its finest.\\n",

            "content": "It's painful to see a show with boundless imagination be constrained by the cold, harsh facts like Flip Flappers. It's a beautifully animated show with an endearing, infectious sort of charm, but BD sales are the lifeblood of seasonal anime, and all the charm in the world won't count for anything if you can't make the grade. Flip Flappers struggled to find an audience, and you could feel the creators; mad-dash scramble to wrap everything by the end of the first and certainly only season.\r\nIf given the chance to stretch its legs and take its time, perhaps over two full-length seasons, I think Flip Flapperscould have developed into something really marvelous. The chance for anything like that now, however, is pure illusion.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has a great start. The artwork and animation is gorgeous throughout, full of liveliness and energy, capturing everything from fantastical dreamscapes to heated battles to the subtle, little gestures that are so often forgotten. That and the intrigue of the setting and the characters was enough to draw me in. I kept watching for the varied worlds each episode would offer; it reminded me of Space Dandy in that each setting felt like a chance for different artists to go hog wild and really let loose. Papika and Cocona are likable leads to boot, which always helps.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I also appreciated was the show's slavish devotion to showing, not telling. There's no narration, no characters explaining every step of their thought process (at first), it's all conveyed through the visuals and the way these characters interact. That can be all too rare in anime and should be applauded.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the last third of the show starts to cram in plot point after plot point, as if the crew realized that they were running out of time. We stop exploring these distant worlds and instead have to drudge through the tedious, infinitely-less interesting backstory. Characters show up with no purpose (NyuNyu). The characters we already have are pretty thin, with little depth or nuance to really explore. We have yet another \"small child with reality warping powers of a god running amok\" plot. Then the whole thing ends with so many threads unresolved at best or completely forgotten about at worst; Yayaka, who's friendship with Cocona is the basis for a powerful turning point in Ep 8, is almost entirely redundant by the end and gets no conclusion to her arc. The story doesn't end, it just stops.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a shame that a rushed end can damage an otherwise good or even great show, but that's why execution is so, so important.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, don't take this 6 to mean its bad. I would still heartily recommend Flip Flappers as a whole; it's breathtaking to look at and, at its best, it's a wildly fun and imaginative ride. You just have to take the show warts and all.",

It takes a lot of cues from Evangelion and that may be up your alley but it's not my thing.\r\nThe animation stays consistent in its style but there is a slight drop off in qualityas the show progresses. Music is fine, there are a few stand out track but the OP and ED stand out more than music used within the show. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go Papika is stagnant, Cocona goes through the standard 'I didn't want to do this/adventure but now because of friends I do!' arc complete with angst in the middle for \"conflict\", and Yayaka learns the true meaning of friendship. Pretty standard stuff all around. Salt isn't a character until the last 4 episodes, Nyunyu just never is a character, the twins (triplets?) don't amount to much but I suppose they had a slight character arc. The best episode in the show in my opinion was centered around a character whose name I can't remember because she was the focus of only that episode and then disappeared for the rest of the show and was only seen in the end as a nod to the fact that they took the time to design a character, remember?\\n\\n\r\nOverall pretty standard stuff, I was really excited for it in the beginning but it tripped over itself in the end and crossed the finish line in mediocrity.",

Think back to whenever someone tried to explain why they loved \u201cClannad: After Story\u201d with \u201cit made me cry,\u201d or think back to whenever someone told you why they loved \u201cShingeki no Kyojin\u201d with \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop looking at the screen!\u201d The same can be applied to why people love those moe slice of life anime, itjust makes them happy. It\u2019s tough to beat emotion with logic, which is why Flip Flappers felt so damn successful. A world where anything could happen, the writers do what they want because they felt like it, not limiting themselves to a set of rules or principles, and goddamn, it was lovely. Every episode explored a new world, with new characters and a different sense of fun each and everytime. Flip Flappers understood perfectly well how to have a good time, and it was an absolute fucking blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of the fun can easily be destroyed in the face of an underwhelming ending. Flip Flappers was shaping up to be a wonderful series, but a sudden shift from episodic fun to an attempt at establishing a serious story changed everything. You could certainly argue that the final arc was what they were going for the whole time, while everything else was filler, but the \u201cfiller\u201d was still significantly better than the actual story. Somehow, even the absolutely gorgeous animation had suffered. In comparison to everything else, the final scenes looked underwhelming. This may seem like a silly criticism, but for a show that boasts visual beauty, it\u2019s disappointing when that beauty fades. Even then, I wouldn\u2019t mind if the story managed to stay on track, but it doesn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nFun Beginnings\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers absolutely decimated my expectations. The cover screamed nothing more than another typical magical girl anime. However, it really is so much more. This series is about exploration, travelling beyond the unknown, and doing crazy things for the sake of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe series surrounds a middle school girl, Cocona, being carried away from her boring, mundane world by a very mysterious girl, Papika. Cocona gets introduced to this \u201cportal\u201d device that will allow her and Papika to travel to whatever world necessary in order to complete their objective. This objective is to obtain crystal shards, which Papika is having trouble gathering on her own, so she enlists Cocona to help her as best as she can.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you haven\u2019t seen the series, it\u2019s pretty clear that this is a setup for something of an episodic nature. At first, the focus was on Papika, Cocona, and their adventures (or perhaps misadventures) within all of these varying places. Every episode explored a new world, and each world possessed strikingly different themes in a wonderful attempt at originality. It\u2019s hard to confine Flip Flappers to one genre, because it tries so many things over the course of its thirteen episodes. A few examples:\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Papika ventures across a gorgeous orange desert in a battle to the death against a group of bandits. She was trying to protect a weak village of weak creatures, and when she squares off against their leader, she practically goes Super Saiyan, and you see the two zooming across the sky as if you\u2019re watching Dragon Ball Z. This episode is clearly inspired by the super power genre. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Cocona and Papika have to pilot giant mechs and battle with other giant mechs over the backdrop of a gorgeous neon city, destroying most of that city in the process. This episode is clearly inspired by the mecha genre.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where Cocona and Papika get trapped in a school, where doll-like figures with giant black holes for eyes follow them around telling them that all they want is to be their \u201cfriend.\u201d This episode is clearly inspired by the horror genre.\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard not to appreciate what the series was trying to do, as every time I clicked \u201cnext episode,\u201d I knew I was in for new. This was an absolutely wonderful change from what I had been used to. I was simply in love in with this sense of adventure.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Flip Flappers once again decimated my expectations, except this time it wasn\u2019t in a positive sense. The last third tries to give us a real story. It tries to wrap up what it had set up, and it wants to leave us on a good note. I could understand this, as having the series stay episodic through and through was probably a scary thought, so the creators might\u2019ve wanted to at least give it an ending. However, this final arc doesn\u2019t manage to be as likable as the rest of the series, and it really destroyed some of the fun.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nNot-so-fun Endings\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers loses its charm when the creators shift the tone entirely. It tries to develop the characters backstories, give everything some kind of relevance, and they finally tell us what the hell is going on. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what it was aiming for, but it just doesn\u2019t work out the way I would have hoped.\\n\\n\r\nWhat had happened to Papika and Cocona in their lives is incredibly compelling, and genuinely got me excited. Seeing Papika\u2019s relationship to Cocona\u2019s mother, and how they were stripped away from each other in such a barbaric way gave me goosebumps. We also get an explanation on why they\u2019re searching for these shards, who the people chasing Papika and Cocona are, and why Cocona\u2019s life is the way it is. Everything was explained decently, and at the start of the serious arc, I was convinced that it would work out pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, where things start to get messy is when the series encroaches upon the conclusion. As Papika and Cocona draw closer, in an attempt to \u201csave\u201d each other, things become more about love, faith, and their \u201cbond.\u201d This sort of escapism might have worked before, in the mystical and whimsical portion of the series, but after giving us this serious, edgy, more depressing backdrop, all tension is diluted when it\u2019s solved so inconsistently. The goosebumps faded away, and I was left with an empty feeling. It didn\u2019t help that the animation started to take a serious hit. The final scenes felt underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the series. Not only the animation, but where all the previous fights were these epic unbelievable brawls, the final fight was more about hyping up a super-move of love to one-shot the final boss. Even if this was consistent with what the show was originally going for, the changing of the tone towards the end didn\u2019t help that they decided to transition back into what they were originally going for out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you disregard this, it\u2019s not like the serious arc was being handled too well to begin with. Sure, I liked some parts of it, but it didn\u2019t change that the writing started to get a bit messy, characters were acting inconsistently, and the story felt underwhelming with its attempt to dramatize everything. Seeing Papika and Cocona go from lovely, fun personas to this serious bunch with edgy backstories felt out of place. I started to get used to it, but then it did a complete flip and they went back to what they originally were. It\u2019s hard to be sure what to feel at this point, so all I could do was watch aimlessly.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers starts out wonderfully, giving us a taste of pure fun for the sake of fun. It does whatever the hell it wants in an attempt to excite you, and it really works. Where things start to fail is when they try to create a darker story, characters, and tone. The serious arc is unfortunately very underwhelming. Although it isn\u2019t bad, it never manages to be as fantastic as the series was beforehand. Flip Flappers really could\u2019ve been something, and I\u2019ll never stop being disappointed that it didn\u2019t turn out the way I wanted.",

            "content": "This show is amazing...if you liked Madoka or any generic anime that has an organization that won't tell the main character what they are doing or why they should be doing it until the last 2 episodes of the show.\r\nThe show's atmosphere drips with the depressing normalcy of Cocona's life. She's a realistic shy high school/middle school girl who just wants to live her life in peace. UNFORTUNATELY, a random girl shows up named Papika, who is one of the most unrealistically cheerful and positive plot driving characters ever. If you like that type of character then this is definitely a fun ride, if youwould prefer something more realistic, again Madoka like, then this show falls short. Papika might as well be immortal, or at least an inhuman freak who believes she is immune to death. Papika and Cocona are two of the lucky few who get to go to bizarre and amazingly inventive worlds the likes of which no one has seen since the Witch Labyrinths from MM... \\n\r\nAlthough the worlds are more thought out and unique than MM, they lack a sense of purpose towards the greater plot and are just a showcase for whatever random thing popped into the animator's head that week. The two girls go to these worlds, which may be quite deadly, for no reason beyond curiosity and a prize that neither seems to care about.  They desire the greater goal of getting \"a wish\" but they barely care about the 10 or so pieces they need in order to actually get the wish. Once they learn the organization's overall goal, it becomes even more questionable why they would help out the organization beyond the fact that the story must happen or there will be no show.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are very unique and purposefully cartoonish, allowing radical changes to their designs when going to different worlds. Unfortunately, the designs are easily the most interesting part of the characters. The art style of their shaded eyes reveal their lack of complexity and failures compared to MM. You might believe there's depth beyond their standard girlish antics, but in reality the character's emotions range from super excited to depressingly sad with nothing but boredom in-between.\\n\r\nThe story obviously is just going to string the audience along until the story becomes darker and darker where the leader of the organization reveals his wish that he wants to achieve and the girls must use the power of their love for each other to overcome whatever the \"adults\" have chosen to believe is the superior ideology.  There is an evil organization. They are barely explored and are basically just the villains from the anime Evangelion and Darling in the Franxx.(hooded figures who want to rule/warp the planet into their own ideal world bla bla bla)\\n\r\nIt is above the traditional, generic magical girl series, but only just barely and I pity anyone who has much higher hopes than a 6/10 for the show's run.\\n\r\nTo be fair, this is probably more like a 5/10, but my standards for stories right now are to at least break previous ideas of the genre and go in a direction that might be better than the ones before it.  For that reason I dropped it to a 3/10.  You need more than a unique art style to push the boundaries of what's expected in new anime.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is a show I didn\u2019t initially care about as I just saw it as an average cutesy fantasy show. Magical girls, inter-dimensional journeys, cute aesthetics, these are things that the show possess that have been done before already. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the cast at first as well. Most of the cast lack substance and the two main characters Cocona and Papika\u2019s rollercoaster relationship annoyed me to death. However, I kept watching and every new journey that unfolds lead to new things that continually picked up my interest. It eventually peaked and came to the realization that this show proved that ithas a lot of potential, albeit not all of them has come to fruition.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that fascinated me is the visuals. They are just hypnotizing as we are presented the world of Pure Illusion and how it contrasts with the real world. The animation is good yet eccentric at times with its bright colors and fast-paced scene transitions, like a constant attempt to grab the viewer\u2019s attention. It\u2019s honestly the main reason I didn\u2019t decide to drop the show early on, it\u2019s just a well-done eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting looks generic but it keeps on unveiling a lot of things, though gimmicky at times, as the main duo travels through the different faces of Pure Illusion. It helped me understand the characters better as it reflects the character\u2019s perspective. Cocona sees it as a nuisance yet Papika sees it as an adventure. Yayaka sees it as a long-term mission and the rest of the cast sees it as a mystery. This conflict aided the strengthening of relationships especially the two main characters who seemingly fight all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progressed in the second half, major revelations are being dropped one by one which caught me off-guard. The whole Pure Illusion started making sense with respect to what the objective of the story is. While I mostly received this as a positive thing, it\u2019s also problematic since the show decided to suddenly go deep into the story when it\u2019s been doing well episodically beforehand. \\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned before, the show has a lot of potential as it keeps opening these potential plot points by the episode. New aspects of the setting are being explored, the characters are starting to get fleshed out, and the story is starting to take flight with the real objective being uncovered. However, not all of them were addressed by the end of the show. There were a lot of questions and mysteries left to what the show was trying to offer. It\u2019s like we are presented these tasty ingredients prepared to be transformed into a dish, but the product feels unfinished. Nevertheless, the story remains solid enough to not crumble on itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Flip Flappers managed to go beyond my underwhelming first impression. It turned out to be one of the best shows this season had to offer. It\u2019s a show recommended to those who like cute girls dealing with fantasy elements with a bit of personal edge to it. Well-presented, consistent, cutesy, heartwarming, I think I already written enough trying to describe how a surprising delight this show is despite addressing a considerable amount of issues but give it a shot anyway. It looks nothing special on the surface, but you might be in for a possible surprise.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As with any type of storytelling media, the overall value of a show will be inevitably judged by how much the viewer makes out of it. And, if there\u2019s a show that exemplifies this idea of a viewer\u2019s dedication to enjoying something affecting their overall opinion of it, it\u2019s a strange little magical girl show from Fall of 2016.\r\nFlip Flappers is one of the most polarizing series I\u2019ve ever seen in anime. On the one hand, there are those who would defend it as ingenious and philosophically meaningful, while on the other hand there are those who dismiss it as cheap yuribait with a contrivedand unfitting final arc. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to be in the hate camp. But I won\u2019t be trying to defend the show\u2019s philosophical value either. I\u2019m simply here to explain the reasons why I enjoyed a fun little Alice-in-Wonderland-style romp through the mind-bending world of Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are quite simple to understand, be it for better or for worse. Three stand out as our main heroines: Cocona, a melancholic schoolgirl who desires to quietly lead a normal, safe life but often finds herself going on fantastic adventures; Papika, an energetic girl who seems to be the polar opposite of Cocona in almost every way, and Yayaka, a more mature girl who seems to be grounded in reality as is Cocona, but even less so susceptible to the emotions that drive Papika.\\n\\n\r\nSome fans have compared these three girls to the proposed three parts of the human psyche: id, ego and superego. This comparison would paint a picture of Cocona (ego) being pulled towards emotional, spontaneous desires by Papika (id) while simultaneously being pulled toward more realistic, colder motivations by Yayaka (superego). Now, there is no way to confirm whether or not the writers initially intended to structure the interactions of their characters in this way. However, it certainly makes for interesting and believable interactions, because the fact remains that, whether intentionally or not, the characters do reflect the psyche and the internal conflicts felt by almost everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest appeals of this show is the way that it embraces the \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d style of storytelling. The first eight episodes of the show focus almost solely on Cocona\u2019s relationship with Papika, demonstrating to the viewers their characteristics and the clashes in their ideals by putting them in various fantasy situations that they\u2019ll need to work together to get out of. Because of how, as the viewers, we able to experience the girls\u2019 interactions firsthand rather than by being told about them via exposition dumps, the climax of the series when Yayaka starts to play a bigger role in the story feels much more meaningful than it would have if the show hadn\u2019t spent its first two-thirds introducing us to our characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters, although fun, don\u2019t serve much of a purpose other than to provide occasional exposition or fanservice. However, each of them, no matter how small their role in the story may be, undergoes a complete character arc by the finale. All of their motivations and worldviews are explained through flashbacks, which additionally help us to understand their reasons for doing what they do and, more importantly, why Pure Illusion behaves for them in the way that it does. \\n\\n\r\nVISUALS - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEasily one of the strongest aspects of this show is the visual style. The art is totally unique, looking very much like a strange combination of SHAFT\u2019s character designs and Trigger\u2019s vibrant, energetic artistry. The characters are drawn beautifully, and the landscapes of Pure Illusion somehow look even better. The trippy watercolors that blend together to form the backgrounds are stunning, and very well convey the atmosphere for any given episode. The dull grays that blend together during the \u201chorror\u201d episode set a completely different tone than the neon lights of the \u201cmecha\u201d episode, which feels altogether unique when compared to the infamous \u201cMad Max\u201d episode.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Flip Flappers is a show about differences in perception of reality, another thing that it does exceedingly well is conveying a character\u2019s emotion by showing what they can see. In one episode, Cocona and Papika are experiencing childhood through the eyes of girl in a dysfunctional family. When she walks in on her parents fighting, they are drawn very loosely, and they pulsate and distort, colors blending and changing to reflect the terror and confusion that this girl feels. \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers also likes to tell its story through the use of symbolism and optical illusions. Early on, a character shows up who will later be revealed to be a villain masquerading as a kindhearted woman. Her first few appearances depict her as the famous illusion that makes it impossible to identify whether the figure in question is a beautiful girl or an old hag. Later on, the show teaches us to associate two characters with each other by giving them the same clover crown at two different times in two different episodes. It even warns us that it will get darker near the end during the first episode, when Cocona and Papika huddle together in the unmistakable shape of a human skull. Even simple things like inconsistencies in reflections tell entire stories in themselves, and a sharp-eyed viewer is rewarded handsomely for their attention to detail. If you pay close attention, you can predict almost the entire show just by watching the OP.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation during action sequences is absolutely brilliant. The fights are characterized by colorful explosions and bright streaks of color as the camera does loops and flips to follow our heroines. My personal favorite sequence is when Cocona and Papika fall through a tunnel into Pure Illusion, and the lines of their characters and the colors of ear skin and clothes begin to change and flash in a total acid trip of gorgeous animation. There is a beautiful scene when someone explodes into clover leaves that drift through the air in a single spectacular shot.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the final episode, the Flip Flappers team ran into budget problems. Because of this, there is an obvious drop in quality during the finale, causing the show to just look \u201cgood\u201d and not \u201cphenomenal.\u201d But hey - Evangelion ran into the same situation, and everyone loves that show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is, simply put, one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. The OP is very catchy, and all of the insert songs are memorable and fit the tone of the scene well. However, the real shining point in the soundtrack is the ED, which is not only easily the best ending theme ever, but one of the best pieces of music ever. Listening to the ED just once will give you a good idea of how the series plays out. It starts as a simple, upbeat song accompanied by little bubbles and other sound effects that fully immerse you in its musical world, but it gradually evolves into an epic, more-than-slightly foreboding and mysterious orchestral piece that sounds like something out of Madoka Magica.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is a show about the Umwelt. The Umwelt is a theory proposed by a scientist named Uexkull (people who have watched the first few episodes of Flip Flappers may recognize Uexkull as the name of Cocona\u2019s pet rabbit). This theory states that perception of reality is different for every given organism, and that each interpretation of the same experience is just as correct as the next. This show takes the seemingly abstract and advanced concept of Umwelten and makes it much more accessible and fun by presenting us with a story about two magical girls who have the ability to jump into these realities created by other people\u2019s interpretations of their surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what sets Flip Flappers apart from other magical girl anime is the fact that, after jumping into these Umwelten (called \u201cPure Illusion\u201d in the show), what our characters do has a clear effect on the \u201creal\u201d world after they leave. Large amounts of the story are told through symbolism, and the viewer has to be paying full attention in order to get the full experience. For the first eight episodes, very little plot development actually occurs, or, at least, very little that is immediately visible. The final arc harkens back to everything that has happened thus far, and has the potential to catch the viewer by surprise if they got too used to the idea of being drip-fed a story. Flip Flappers draws influences from, parodies, and gives not-so-subtle nods to (some would even say \u201crips off\u201d) Evangelion, Mad Max, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann, Alice in Wonderland, and Nausicaa, to name a few. I won\u2019t try to defend these influences due to the fact that they didn\u2019t bother me. The story was still a good one, and that was what mattered.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many theories as to what deeper meanings may be concealed within Flip Flappers\u2019 eccentric plot. One of the more obvious points is the fact that, as the story goes on, it becomes more and more apparent that Cocona and Papika are in love with each other. As Cocona struggles to come to terms with her sexuality, she is eventually forced to confront an over-protective mother who is less than pleased that her daughter is a lesbian. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Pure Illusion has been compared to the Dantean model of Hell by some, as various characters in the show state that Pure Illusion has layers, much like Dante\u2019s model. Symbols of Hell and similar concepts such as the Thinker statue, the Drowning of Ophelia, and a literal vision of eternal damnation populate the show\u2019s early episodes. Now, as I said, I\u2019m not going to try and defend the show\u2019s supposed philosophical value. But I will state that the entire series is very open to interpretation, almost as though it is the viewer\u2019s own Umwelt. I can\u2019t say whether or not this is intentional, but it\u2019s very enjoyable either way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be divided logically into two halves. As previously stated, the first half is about Cocona and Papika\u2019s relationship, and is very episodic. Some of the episodes suffer pacing issues, but nothing too dramatically awkward happens. Following the girls\u2019 ninth trip into Pure Illusion, the plot finally kicks in and the show starts to feel more deconstructive, or at least much darker and more mature. Similar to how the Harry Potter books get progressively darker to reflect Harry\u2019s maturing, Flip Flappers does the same as Cocona finally comes to terms with her sexuality. This is what has awarded the show with the most criticism: the ending. However, it didn\u2019t bother me, because I saw it coming all along.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to say here. I love this show. I would run home from school on Thursdays just to watch the latest episode, then lie down and ponder it for at least a good hour afterwards. I participated in drawing the great big thank you card that /a/ sent to the studio after the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is quite the enjoyable ride, for someone willing to keep an open mind and accept the show for what it is. It\u2019s unique and pretty, if nothing else. Give it a try, and see if it suits your taste. If you aren\u2019t sold by episode 5, it\u2019s probably not going to be worth your time. But if you\u2019re looking for something equal parts tender and intricate, this is a perfect choice.",

            "content": "When keeping up with 2016 anime, I would often watch a title with a nagging sense that something was missing - something I wasn't seeing that was keeping a show with a workable or seemingly exciting premise from being truly engaging. And yet, for the longest time I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on exactly what that something was.\r\nThen, as the year approached its end, I was shown a world almost entirely unlike anything I knew from that year. Suddenly, it all made sense! What was missing was surprisingly simple: a sense of passion - ambition! A willingness to take risks - to try somethingbold, run with it confidently, and, perhaps most importantly, to have fun along the way!\\n\\n\r\nThis key ingredient sums up exactly what Flip Flappers sets out to do, and for the most part, it delivers in style! It\u2019s not a show that\u2019s interested in playing it safe, running with the pack, or following the norm. It does its own thing in its own world. It remains committed to this and never looks back. Not only does it feel novel, but as it runs, it succeeds in providing something many of its contemporaries struggle with: pure, unapologetic fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe show immediately pops with a striking presentation style that is excellent for the experience it attempts to create. Anytime the setting enters the whimsical world of Pure Illusion (which it very frequently does), a vibrant and impressionistic colour palette combines with sketchbook character designs to create worlds which immediately pop out at viewers; smears and flashes of colour - the worlds themselves - comes alive onscreen through highly expressive and fluid animation, all backed by a suitably fantastical score. Whenever this show wants to sell a big set piece, bombastic moment or climactic sequence, it does so with ease, energy and expression filling every frame! These moments are exciting; often breathtaking, and they combine with a general livelihood and an ever-present sense of wonder and novelty to immediately make Flip Flappers a fun watch!\\n\\n\r\nBut such moments aren\u2019t the only things contributing to this anime's flair. The very nature of Pure Illusion - an abstract world which seems loosely representative of characters' inner states of mind - is a perfect fit for this style of entertainment. Flip Flappers can effortlessly realize just about any setting it wants without it ever feeling out of place, nor completely random. This is great for keeping the level of variety and creativity consistently high. With this, and since much of the show runs on a cohesive semi-episodic structure, pretty much any crazy idea the show comes up with can be successfully built up to, and then executed with gusto!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, when the main pair of magical girls suddenly finds itself in an epic high-speed flying surfboard chase to escape from a crazy torture factory, or a DBZ-style fight involving a mind-altering mask culminating in a meteoric final smash, it works like a charm!\\n\\n\r\nAll of this crazy not-quite-randomness is thankfully held together by a controlled yet dynamic sense of tone and pacing. Each episode offers something new - something fresh - and each one makes an effort to go all-out with itself. In addition, it all ties into a core theme of the show: that of identity. Pure illusion itself is an expression of this, and in terms of story, each episode for most of the series tackles aspects of the theme in a different and interesting manner. One particular highlight of this (and of the show\u2019s writing as a whole) came in episode 6. I won\u2019t say any more on the matter, but it remains one of my favourite anime episodes of 2016. Point being, the show has a sense of cohesion that keeps most of it from feeling too unhinged, and allows viewers to build up expectations that it can subsequently defy in any number of ways.\\n\\n\r\nJust a few episodes in, I was already preparing to crown this my favourite anime of fall 2016 by far! And... in the end, I definitely think this is a show worth watching, but unfortunately, it hits a few stumbles.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the strengths of the show\u2019s presentation and structure, the characterization is often lackluster. While the main characters aren\u2019t one-dimensional, per se, they tend to lack in depth or detail that could really make them interesting to invest in. The main duo of Cocona and Papika can certainly be fun to watch as they contrast with and bounce off each other, but this dynamic relies heavily on moment-to-moment chemistry and less on meaningful conflict or development. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t present. Cocona in particular does go through several instances of personal conflict and development - disagreements with Papika\u2019s adventurous ideologies being one example - but little of it, for Cocona or any other character, is presented with the kind of weight, importance or urgency to get a viewer eager to see them grow or overcome any difficulty. Similar things can be said for the rest of the main cast. As for the supporting characters, they\u2019re pretty forgettable, with maybe one or two exceptions (Again, I refer to episode 6). As a whole, the characters don\u2019t actively harm the show, but rarely do much for it either.\\n\\n\r\nOne may also notice many of my aforementioned praises apply to \"most\" of Flip Flappers. Alas, it admittedly falters a bit later on, and in ways that prevents it from ultimately reaching its full potential. Sometime around the halfway point, Flip Flappers had a change of writers, and it shows. I suspect the general direction of the story was either changed or left on the sidelines for too long, because when things finally start unravel, they REALLY unravel. And so does the quality of storytelling. As if from nowhere, the show decides it has a ton of plot to reveal, and is going to pick up the pace as much as it deems necessary to get through it all.\\n\\n\r\nHow much is that, exactly? Enough that all the viewer's attention is suddenly fixated on following this mass of new information and development, instead of actually enjoying the ride. Flip Flappers, which relies so heavily on its apparent simplicity and well-paced structure to remain grounded - to create its special brand of charm - loses itself to a degree when it comes unhinged. In its strives for progression, it sacrifices any chance to be reflective or create a sense of wonder and fascination, and it doesn't leave the audience much time to catch their breath either.\\n\\n\r\nThe result resembles a rollercoaster whose design was unexpectedly and radically altered partway through assembly. What was once a carefully-paced ride quickly becomes a tornado of loops and corkscrews and twists and turns one after another, and another, and another, and another, while the track suddenly becomes bumpier and more hastily-thrown together at the expense of rider comfort!\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s almost as though they got two-thirds of the way through construction and realized the track was too straightforward, so they decided to build THREE TIMES AS MANY CRAZY TURNS into the last third to compensate! \u201cWhat\u2019s that?! We\u2019ll make our riders dizzy?! No worries! We\u2019ve got them in the cart already!\u201d I admire the ambition, but Flip Flappers may have tried to tackle just a tad TOO much. Attempting to cram all the resulting plot development into 4-5 episodes was always going to be nigh impossible without the pacing suffering to a degree. If it had been granted a longer construction time and was a 2-cour series, then likely none of this would have been a problem, but regardless, what we got was, at times, a bit of a mess.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Flip Flappers doesn\u2019t completely lose its way during this segment. Even at its clumsiest of times, it never completely loses direction, and if one can keep up with its frenetic pace, the story can still be followed to a degree. In addition, its sense of expressiveness and energy remains mostly intact throughout, while the visual quality stays impressively consistent. And fortunately, this jerky ride still eventually reaches a fairly satisfying and conclusive stopping point (ending) so riders can steady themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOne final silver lining to the comparatively weaker third act actually emerges from the previous ones, and that is the show\u2019s knack for effective foreshadowing. For all the twists, turns and unexpected bits of information Flip Flappers eventually blasts through, many of them are actually built up to quite well. While a few things still feel a bit spontaneous, Flip Flappers as a whole rarely seems to haphazardly throw out its plot twists without some level of setup. I won't be giving anything away here, as even with the chaotic structure near the end, discovering these things can be fun to an extent. Amidst all of them, though, there was one revelation in particular that really impressed me with its unusual yet brilliant method of foreshadowing. Without giving too much information, one of the ways it hints at itself is through the very structure of certain episodes themselves, and the effect that structure has on the viewer. If that sounds rather meta, you\u2019d be right, but if it sounds like I\u2019m overthinking things, I can affirm I\u2019m not.\\n\\n\r\nIf only the viewer was a bit more invested in the character(s) involved. Then, perhaps, this revelation would have had more impact - beyond its novel execution - and indeed, the same can be said for the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Flip Flappers concludes itself as an imperfect but valuable marvel. It strides forth unexpectedly, as if from another other world, seemingly out of nowhere, to show what it can achieve! As a thematically varied audiovisual treat, full of creative energy, it possesses a rare, passionate desire to do what many series forgot how to do: to just have fun for once. In today\u2019s period of frequent anime monotony, Flip Flappers stands out as a welcome modern breath of fresh air; one that knows its strengths, and plays to them well. \\n\\n\\n\r\n- FINAL SCORES & SUMMARIES -\\n\\n\r\n* Critical Quality: 6.5/10 (Story - 6 | Art - 9 | Sound - 7 | Character - 5)\\n\r\n\u2013 Despite some late-game plotting and pacing weaknesses, as well as functional but unremarkable characterization, Flip Flappers excels where it counts. Its top-notch, vibrant, energetic presentation and consistent creativity really help it succeed.\\n\\n\r\n* Memorability: 7.5/10 \u2013 In addition to a strong sense of novelty, Flip Flappers knows how to craft creative and memorable moments and properly sell them, and does so frequently; it all gives this series a very unique identity.\\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment: 6.5/10 \u2013 My enjoyment was brought down a fair bit by the final third, which simply wasn\u2019t as engaging as the rest despite all the surprises and plot developments. But the \u201crest\u201d I refer to was definitely a fun ride!\\n\\n\r\n* Overall: 6.5/10 \u2013 Flip Flappers didn\u2019t quite reach the highs I was initially hoping for, but I still consider it a respectable series that achieved what it set out to do. Even with its setbacks, it has enough standout qualities to make it well worth watching, and I can confidently recommend it to anyone interested. One small warning, though: the ending theme won't be leaving your head for a while.\\n",

            "content": "Finding the hidden gem of a year is always the best feeling an anime fan could feel. In my short experience with seasonal anime (following seasonal stuff since around 4 seasons ago as of the creation of this review), completing this series was my reminder of why I follow seasons in the first place. Watching anime weekly provides the opportunity to try out stuff one would have never had given a shot if certain series were completed. I was really having trouble containing my thoughts for this series, which is why this review will serve as the way to express them. An anime who's nameis what I imagined the title for a soulless kids show would be... get this... Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Spoilers ahead. My overall thoughts can be found in the last paragraph for those too lazy to read, though I doubt this will be long anyways.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nThe story of Flip Flappers can't really be detailed in much ways without getting into spoiler territory. MAL's synopsis for once does a good job at saying what this show is about (without spoiling), but it does not do the events that occur justice in every episode. The main character Cocona is an everyday middle school girl that encounters a red-haired, eccentric girl of her age (in a flying surfboard of all things) named Papika. Shortly after their first interaction, they end up in a parallel world where it snows 24/7 and giant white-haired mammoths are the norm. After a life threatening situation, the main girl's thigh birthmark starts glowing, she goes badass Super Saying and saves her (it sounds weird, I know). What happens next is a sort of \"episodic\" adventure between our main characters, with each passing episode embracing its random nature. Explosive sakuga action, fun comedy, the discovery of intriguing worlds, yuri undertones and an insane mix of ideas ensue. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I said this show is \"episodic\", there was a reason that I added it in quotation. This show does have a very linear plot. The reason I said episodic is because for the majority of the series, there's a huge \"where the hell is this going?\" vibe. At the end of each episode the viewer is left off with more questions than answers, wondering if their questions are going to be answered at some point. It sounds bad but trust me, the show shines its brightest when its setting things up. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is between two rival\u00a0 secret organizations who send out middleschoolers (the two main girls working for one of these two) to look for mysterious \"fragments\" said to being capable of granting any wish if all are collected. Pretty straightforward and decent, but I found the main plot to be way more uninteresting than the \"episodic\" adventure. Basically, in the last episodes, the creator(s) making this show realized that they needed to wrap things up and answer things, so they did the best they could do to provide a satisfying ending. The end result wasn't bad by any means, but it is pretty evident that they focused more on making this a fun experience rather than having a thought-provoking plot. This reminds me of my experience with Re:Zero, where I enjoyed the journey a hell of a lot more than the main story. The story of Flip Flappers comes off as simple and lackluster compared to the insane ride we were given during the first 9-10 episodes or so. Since the show has to explain what they have set up, the last couple of episodes changes focus to other side characters that are crucial to the plot, but far more uninteresting than the original duo. My wish is that Studio 3Hz would have an unlimited budget to keep making episodic adventures between Cocona and Papika who are the real stars of Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nPop-culture References:\\n\r\nIt is always very interesting when a show references other famous works in pop-culture. This show didn't just made one or two references to real life works (for example how 3-gatsu no Lion referenced My Neighbor Totoro and made it a running gag, which was pretty cool btw), the show literally has anything and everything that would make the show cooler. It's like the creators of this show sat down one day, wrote down everything they liked from modern entertainment and decided to add it to Flip Flappers. Some include the following: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, how they literally chase a rabbit through a hole like in Alice in Wonderland, Star Wars' Tatooine, Dragon Ball's transformations and fight scenes, Mad Max vehicles and enemies, mayhem like in The Warrior and the Sorceress, a little bit of over-the-top animation from Ginax, Jackie Chan fighting maneuvers from Drunken Master, every Magical Girl anime ever, every Mech anime ever, Power Rangers, and many more that I am too lazy to look for. The show even does references to historical people and groups, like how a character is named after a German Biologist Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll and how the baddies visualy are a carbon copy of the KKK (yep). Most references happen in the parallel worlds of \"Pure Illusion\" and seeing how unique and insane each look, I would have loved to see more, but sadly the anime has to come to an end and I am left wondering what other crazy worlds were left undiscovered.\\n\\n\r\nYuri Undertones/Exploring Sexuality:\\n\r\nFor those who didn't follow discussions for this anime as it aired, there were plenty of talks whether this anime was a commentary on the LGBT experience told through a middleschooler and the self-discovery of being queer. For example, in many instances the show seemed to hint at something far greater than just presenting how good of friends Cocona and Papika are. Camera angles, optical illusions dealing with perception, fanservice, and other methods of cinematography were used to hint of a possible relationship between the two main girls. Hell, there's even an episode where Cocona straight up questions if her love for her friend Papika is just that, a friendship. Being completely honest here, I got pretty excited when stuff like this occurred (not in a perverted way, baka). In my opinion there aren't enough anime out there that explore sexuality, and the ones that do do not explore it in the way Flip Flappers does. An anime that dives into queer discovery being told through the eyes of a teenage girl, plus adding kickass sakuga and fun comedy sounds golden in my opinion. The setup was there and the subtlety was present, so did it deliver? Well, it depends on who you ask. The show takes the route where if you do not want these themes to be a part of your experience with this series then you will be okay (except for episode 7 were the yuri reaches its highest point). The best way I could describe it (being the geek I am) is comparing it to an Easter Egg in a movie or videogame. It's present for those who look for it, and those who don't bother to look deeper will never know. If you are looking for something more than just undertones you will be dissapointed just like I was. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the yuri subtleties that were present, but I cannot help but end with a bad taste of feeling like I was yuri-bated yet again. My crave for them yuris will never be satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nOne of Flip Flappers' best attributes is without a doubt its visuals. This show is full of impressive sakuga action moments that look pretty amazing when they want to be (holy snap epsiode 3 was impressive). Of course it has its still moments, but for the most part it is a visual extravaganza, especially when the characters are in the parallel worlds part of what is known as \"Pure Illusion\" where the possibilities of fantasy are endless. The character designs are good and my only nitpick is that I found the character's eyes to be too far apart from each other making them look a bit weird to me at first, but again this is just a nitpick that I completely forgot about later on. Colors are also used heavily to convey emotion and establish a mood. Fanservice is apperant from time to time, but it's not \"in your face panties and tits\", rather more subtle and tasteful which I can at least appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another thing that is worth mentioning. It is not the best thing I've heard by any means, but it does a great job at setting the correct mood. The opening and ending songs are permanently stuck in my brain until I die because they are catchy as hell (I'm listening to the ED as I'm typing this ffs). The opening especially is perfectly fitting for this series. Just take a second and go check out the OP and tell me it doesn't get you hyped to watch the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nWhat makes Flip Flappers such a great show (apart from all the unique worlds) is the characters, specifically the main duo you see on the cover. They have very different personalities, Cocona being a rather shy, cautious and well-behaved girl that cares for her loved ones and Papika acting as her polar opposite, with the only thing that they have in common is their love for others and one another. This back and forth between two completely different people make for very interesting dynamics and comedic situations. The side characters are okay with some having more development than others, but overall there wasn't a character I disliked (except for that pink-haired scientist that is just obnoxiously loud and serves as an unfunny comedic character).\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nIn the end, Flip Flappers is by far one of the most underrated and overlooked anime of the year. It is a memorable story about a girl overcoming her difficulties, and this self-growth is portrayed through parallel worlds that defy logic and understanding. It starts out great and gets better and better as the series progresses. Unfortunately, the last three episodes take a simplified route at answering the viewers questions that were built up throughout the series and is not nearly as good as the rest. Is it a yuri? Is it a magical girl show? Is it a clusterfuck of ideas? I'm not entirely sure yet, but what I can say is that Flip Flappers is one hell of a ride.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is one of those anime that craves a visual feast for the eyes rather than telling a cohesive narrative and developing interesting characters. This is rather an exception; Flip Flappers is a gorgeous looking anime. Brimming with strikingly colorful aesthetics of a whimsical fantasy world. The uniqueness of designing a fantasy world with different variations of its own world is a feat. Flip Flappers is all about visual presentation and it rightfully executes how that whimsical fantasy world can be. So why does this get a 6 regardless of the fact the anime has vast potential to be an underrated/hidden gem? Well, everythingelse was just overlooked and these overlooked aspect is what set apart of the cracks shown.\\n\\n\r\nCocona is our central protagonist of Flip Flappers; A quiet and reserved ordinary schoolgirl encounters a strange hyperactive girl named Papika, who finds complete interest in Cocona just from her nice fragrance or scent. Papika drags Cocona into an alternate dimension strayed from their normal one, thus began their wild adventures of what is known as Pure Illusion. Not much is rather further developed beyond Papika's blatant fascination with Cocona and Cocona's indecisiveness whether she likes being on an adventure with said clingy hyperactive Papika. Their relationship can be summed up into a yuri-bait connection that felt forced. Yes, it is explained why Papika acts the way she does in later episodes but it does come off obnoxious when we are reminded that she loves Cocona. The other side characters are either forgettable and uninteresting even the ones that are developed. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that Flip Flappers excels the most is the art design; the colorful cast of characters are very distinguishable and each episode have variety of art from cutesy and fun to gloomy and dark. The character designs are very adorable especially the main heroines. The colors pops or stands out to blend the aesthetics of the details in the background; a pleasing eye candy. The animation is also a noteworthy praise with intense heart pumping action. Although, the action sequences were just the icing on the cake. Nonetheless, the art is gorgeous to look at\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of an episodic adventure is really good set up of variety of different imaginative and creative world Pure Illusion has to offer. It can range from a sci-fi Tron-like cyberpunk city to a post apocalyptic Mad Max setting. These aspects are implemented within these world and takes a unique spin of these worlds like adding mechs and magical girl power-ups. However, the following final act is what set the bar low on the expansive world of Pure Illusion felt artificial than what was already established. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the major criticism that hurts the overall experience of Flip Flappers. The final act/climax was clearly extremely rushed and the lack of direction. Characters are randomly added out of nowhere and served no purpose to the plot, excessive amount of exposition dump and seamless explanations of the world, removing the sense of boundless exploration that Pure Illusion was set to establish in the beginning. At this certain point, the interest was lost and the climax was focused on the story than the random adventures. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think Flip Flappers is bad, far from it. The poor writing, weak characterization, and the finale suffers the show's potential of an actual hidden gem. I wanted this to be something special than other mediocre obscure shows yet seeing through the cracks cannot be overlooked. Still, the the uniqueness of Flip Flappers will always be the visual presentation and how it was executed significantly as an eye candy experience. Watching Flip Flappers only for the aesthetics is your main reason why it is worth watching. It is a fun joyride through wild imaginative creativity.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(Updated 12/31)\r\nFor anyone who's seen the other works of Studio 3Hz, you'd know that they created Sora no Method, which spiked about a 6.7/10 on MyAnimeList, and continues to be criticized for one of the worst plot holes seen in anime. On top of Sora no Method, Dimension W, a Sci-Fi Seinen that got pretty popular spiked about 7.3/10 on MyAnimeList. Studio 3Hz didn't do Dimension W on their own, the did it in part with the studio Orange, and besides Sora no Method, there seemed to be no original, redeeming work that could make a name for this studio.\r\nFall 2016 rolls around, and withthe releases of several new fan favorites and a few new sequels to popular anime, Flip Flappers was one of the releases. Just like every season, there's seemingly one or two anime that get pushed aside and not really mentioned, and Flip Flappers is one of those anime. Does it deserve it? Absolutely not. \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is something totally different, a breath of fresh air in terms of animation, character, music, story, and setting. Every time I watched an episode of Flip Flappers, I felt happy, relaxed, and desperate to watch the next episode. It starts early with a hook, and it definitely keeps you reeled in.\\n\\n\r\nStudio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this fun, colorful, beautiful, and enjoyable anime with extremely likable characters, both protagonist and antagonist and even background characters who are hardly mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8 \\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has a concept I've never seen portrayed in anime. The collection of \"fragments\" throughout the setting of Pure Illusion is both relaxing and will keep you on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The setting Studio 3Hz set for Flip Flappers is gorgeous and so flexible, so full of adventure and molds the story into something that's beautiful, enjoyable, and allows viewers to feel like they're a part of the world Flip Flappers portrays.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what keeps the story from the perfect 10 is that in the first 4-5 episodes, the story seems scattered and spotty. The execution of the story is weak, but eventually the hook that starts in the second episode with more story in Pure Illusion makes the story eventually progress like it should. The first few episodes seem to lack follow a plot that progresses later into the anime, it's more to show us, the viewers, the world of Pure Illusion, and the inhabitants and natives of Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nIf the story in the beginning would've started off with the story of Cocona's confusion about her life, and about her parents, and how she's started going to Pure Illusion after meeting Papika, then this score would be much higher.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers has gorgeous animation and character and setting design that Studio 3Hz has never indulged in. To quote my friend, it has that \"Trigger\" feel to it. The feeling that reminds you of Kill la Kill or Uchuu Patrol Luluco. The animation is smooth, the setting of Pure Illusion is gorgeously portrayed and makes you want to pause so you don't miss a single thing it shows you. Even when the setting isn't in Pure Illusion, the art is still bright and colorful. \\n\\n\r\nEven when the ambience on the animation and color is turned down to a darker scale, like in some parts of Pure Illusion or at night time, it still pops out and looks gorgeous. The art is extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally my favorite part of the show is the sound and music. I'll be honest to tell you that the opening song and ending song are probably on my top favorite anime songs of all time. The music is just the right amount of hype to get the viewers excited for the episode that follows, and the ending song is peaceful and has the viewers on their toes desperate for the next episode, so they can experience the beautiful atmosphere this anime create.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for the battles that happen are realistic, but also add to the added Sci-Fi genre Flip Flappers have, giving it that \"futuristic\" feel. That's what I love most about this anime - it's Sci-Fi, but it's not a Sci-Fi that's ruined with over-the-top cliches, especially in terms of the sound. The ambience and sound in Pure Illusion just hypes up the gorgeous setting more and more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Flip Flappers are unique and all differentiate from one another. We have Cocona, who later in the anime has more of an important role than the beginning, but is portrayed at first as an idolized honors student. Papika is a mixture of our comic relief, but is also Cocona's loyal, cute, and enjoyable partner. Together, these two take adventure into Pure Illusion, where we meet Yayaka, who is partnered with Yuyu and Toto. Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto prove to be interesting characters and great antagonists for our heroes Cocona and Papika.\\n\\n\r\nWith Pure Illusion being used in the first few episodes just to show off how this universe and world work, we are given a variety of unique and amazing characters that do not come back after the episode they're premiered in. Characters like Welwitschia would be amazing to see work alongside Yayaka, Yuyu and Toto, but is seemingly removed right after her appearance. Uexk\u00fcll, Cocona's pet rabbit, is given a good chunk of screen time in the beginning and is seemingly shown to maybe have an impact in the show, but never actually does a lot. And the addition of TT-392, or Buu-chan could've been done so much better. Buu-chan seems to have a lot of potential, but is easily manipulated and converts to whatever female antagonist is thrown at us, and seems to be more of a hinderance than a partner to Cocona and Papika.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\\n\r\nAs I've continually mentioned in my review, the anime's hook starts right when we're introduced to Cocona's and Papika's delve into the wonderful and gorgeous world of Pure Illusion. The anime is extremely enjoyable and makes you want to delve into the same adventures of Cocona and Papika (Studio 3Hz, Flip Flappers game pleaseee?) Every Thursday watching this anime, I was so excited for the newest episodes to come out that I would wait at the 30 minute mark before they came onto Crunchyroll just to watch them right then and there. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is extremely fun and enjoyable, and it's definitely my pick for my absolute favorite for Fall 2016.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.4/10 (rounded down to 9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI could not recommend this anime more. It's so fun and so stunning, Studio 3Hz really blew it out of the water with this. \\n\\n\r\nWATCH. THIS. ANIME!",

            "content": "Dimension Jumping Magical Girls with a dash of a \"Coming of Age story\" and a paintbucket full of beautifully bizarre scenery!\r\nLA wants to get straight into it...so let's dive into the technical rabbit hole shall we?.\r\nFlip Flapper's plot format for the first 10 episodes goes into a \"World a Week\" kind of schema but using movie and anime references as it's settings, such examples being Episode 3 having Fist of the North Star and Mad Max Fury Road settings to Episode 5 having the Shining merged with yuri genre settings to even the meta-narrative of \"archetypes and HECK the MECHA genre in one episode. Eventheir transformation sequences harkens to Pretty Cure's transformations to the point it's oozed into their attack names. The plot format surrounds Papika and Cocona trying to find the the \"amorphorus\" for the FliFlap organization under the various omni-genred episodes we get for unknown reasons and another rival organization by the name of Asclepius trying to get it as well for the first 9 episodes. Really these early 9 episodes was to emphasis and develop the relationship between our two main leads of Papika and Cocona through going through their trials and tribulations of their relationship and most importantly Cocona's indecisiveness, they both face when going into the Pure Illusion worlds. Come episode 10, all the hints and the reasoning to getting the amorphorus, Papika in general, Cocona's involvement in all this, Pure Illusion in general all comes into full force, something LA wasn't HARDLY expecting. In all respects, this development isn't exactly new as the hints were their just subtle in it's approach and because of this, the plot twists come episode 10 were amazingly executed, what happens after episode 10, the omni-genred feature of self-reflection and coming of age story for Cocona for Flip Flappers quickly changed into a yuri shounen anime...seriously that's the vibe LA got after this development, but that a bit later.\\n\\n\r\nPapika and Cocona are polar opposites for the most part and although it's an easy opposites attract what with Papika the hyper-always genki character who's rather clingy to Cocona, her mysteriousness can kinda be a saving grace to Papika (which was LA's perspective). Cocona on the other hand, is a strict, no nonsense character though she opens up halfway through the anime though she reverts or becomes confused by her relationship to Papika (quite frankly metaphorically visually shown in one episode). There is one other character, Yayaka who's a friend of Cocona but she's ALOT more that you'd realize and becomes a rather focused character by the end of it and her rivalry both in character and relationship to Papika and Cocona respectively really made an interesting character and really impacted the major plotline during the first 8 to 9 episodes, because of that she quite easily was LA's favourite character in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other minor characters that do get their own development episodes but through LA's perspective is shown through some of the Pure Illusion worlds, the most easily noticable being Iroha Irodori voiced by Saori Oonishi and if you could interpret it, Hidaka voiced by Jun Fukushima. Once again come episode 10, a floodgate worth of character and plot development focus on many of the secrets of Asclepius and FliFlap comes into focus and essentially reigns in character development from the various characters surrounding these two secret organizations WHILE keeping Papika and Cocona's development simultaneously. LA really can't explain more otherwise it goes GREATLY in spoilers, especially one character development who's enveloped and connect to ALL of this. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, there are two notable seiyuu's LA has to take note of, Ayaka Ohashi as Yayaka and Minami Takahashi as Cocona, they both nailed their characters greatly as well as giving them a wide vocal range though Minami had stuck round with the indecisively shy vocals due to Cocona during the beginning but she like Papika's seiyuu M.A.O got better over time. On speaking of which, M.A.O as Papika was narrowly annoying due to M.A.O's constant hyper genki status throughout their adventures and both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi shouting each others name in a moe cadence gotten M.A.O a bit of slack, but seriously, both M.A.O and Minami Takahashi as seiyuu's definitely gotten better over time. The rest of the vocal cast was pretty decent though some had the inflictions of hyper genkiness that M.A.O had like Jun Fukushima as Hidaka and NyuNyu's voice actor (was uncredited as LA wrote this). LA thought the one notable from the minor cast would easily go to Welwitschia's voice actor Aki Toyosaki in voicing one of the episodic villains and MAN did Aki go hammy in this one!. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, LA quite easily loved both the OP and ED for this anime, but most definitely Flip Flappers OP \"Serendipity\" by ZAQ was LA's favourite OP for Fall 2016. The ED, \"FLIP FLAP FLIP FLAP\" by TO-MAS feat.Chima added to the bizarre fairy tale book feel to the anime and at times during cliffhangars did bring in either a moodswinger once this ED arrived but nonetheless both OP and ED were great for Flip Flappers. LA doesn't have much to say about the OST in general, though it was atmospheric to say the most, but the OST and the sakuga used blended soo well that LA hardly noticed the OST half the time (though LA is saying this in a good light).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, as LA stated at the preamble, Flip Flappers is an outright sakuga fest of animation and it's the more fantastical and broad reach of atmospheric detail from the crazy landscapes of the desert to tron-like cities to classic architecture to the more creepy mansion worlds and fast frantic battles makes LA be reminded of an Alice in Wonderland meets Anime kind of appeal to it's animation. The character designs are \"exotic\" and color-coded for easy distinction, not to mention LA just loves the parallels in color brought onto Papika and Cocona, easily coming from how Papika and Cocoa's hair color swaps during their transformation sequences further emphasizing Papika and Cocona's relationship with one another. What can LA say for Studio 3Hz, but if the anime's plot isn't getting to you, the animation most certainly will.\\n\\n\r\nThe final three episodes if anything really did change into a cohesive narrative instead of the episodic BUT at the same time tying loose ends towards those episodic episodes and even call backs to them, this also gave a HUGE amount of character development to Yayaka, however she's a really heavy spoiler character in Flip Flappers overall, what LA will say is that because of these final three episodes, she herself came to her own realization and she became a very focused and 3-dimensional character. This also leads up to Cocona's own realization which comes in the form of the surprise major \"villain\" of the anime which brings themes of \"fate or your own freedom\" which again ties up loose resolutions towards both Cocona's adventuring with Papika throughout all the Pure Illusions to Cocona's relationship to Papika solidifying itself by the penultimate episode. As much as the narrative structure changed, it also helped that the \"episodic episodes\" lead into something much greater and just wasn't used to be \"filler-ish\" episodes which gets revisited at one point along with a few relational indecisiveness from Cocona to have a resolution but it also helped in the character development to most of the major characters as well. If there was but one flaw LA could see in the final arc was that it condensed what was the mystery and subtle background hinting to the bigger picture into a simple yet slightly complicated story with a villain who doesn't know any better (though again not a bad villain on that regards due to the circumstances) with only the major characters impacting the plot. What compensated all this was the weird and intensely fantastical final battle with this villain along with it resolving the majority of the plotlines, THAT was enough to satisfy LA with this kind of ending.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers' episodic omni-genred nature to quickly change into a simple story with a villain just to resolve all the mystery behind Pure Illusion, Papika and Yayaka along with Cocona's indecisiveness. Flip Flappers had a great thing going with it's fantastical Pure Illusion worlds and the romp and character self-reflection, \"coming of age story\" as subtle hinting as good themes coming from these wondrous Pure Illusion worlds, it stumbled slightly however once it went into a cohesive narrative and turning what could have been turned into an anime with a bigger picture into a simple story, but LA can quite honestly give a saving grace for how the ending was resolved along with that final battle, but other flaws such as it's lacking character development from it's minor cast but nonetheless, LA doesn't think Flip Flappers NEEDED to fill ALL basis to be a great anime, what Flip Flappers ended with was good enough not to get LA's scorn for. Yet still praise it's storytelling in the form of Cocona's coming of age story, brilliant animation, soundtrack and satisfyingly resolved ending.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is an original entry in the magical girl genre focused on middle school student Cocona and her interactions with the energetic Papika as both adventure in the alternate world of Pure Illusion taking on enemy creatures and acquiring magical powers from the amorphus gems that are left behind by the creatures when defeated.\r\nThe one thing that sticks out with Flip Flappers is its gorgeous animation when the series is taken over to Pure Illusion. The scenery of Pure Illusion offers up some rather creative and bizarre environments and enemies that Cocona and Papika encounter in their adventures that include a colorful landscape whereour two heroines start to develop rabbit-like characteristics and a gloomy version of their school that traps the two girls in a time loop. There are a variety in the types of threats that Cocona and Papika have to confront within Pure Illusion that allow for some variety in the type of choreography seen in action scenes throughout the series from a typical superhero-powered battle to even a mecha fight. The animation has some shortcomings with character designs looking a bit on the simple side for details in certain regards and some of the animated sequences looking a bit jerky with movement. But these don't detract too heavily from the rather unique presentation offered with Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nMoving past presentation, Flip Flappers' storytelling is mostly straightforward with focusing on Cocona and Papika's adventures. The first half of the series is mostly focused on the two girls collecting the amorphus gems they acquire from defeated enemy creatures, learning more about the world of Pure Illusions, developing their relationship, and crossing paths with a rival organization also seeking out the amorphus gems for mysterious reasons. There are hints dropped in early episodes that Cocona and Papika may have a closer connection than what it would seem on the surface. The second half gradually explores these developments (and what is revealed leads to a dramatic twist for the series compared to its more light-hearted mood) and the motives of the rival organization in question, which eventually build up to a climactic battle that tests the bond that our two heroines established with one another throughout the course of the series. The revelations mostly make sense when looking back on some of the hints dropped, though there are a few unclear elements to the plot that Flip Flappers regrettably does not address in its finale.\\n\\n\r\nMinor issues aside, Flip Flappers was still a solid entry in the magical girl genre having a creative alternate world that Cocona and Papika have their adventures in and offers up an engaging plot focused on exploring the bond and connections that our two heroines have with one another. A solid recommendation if you are a fan of magical girl titles.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is without a doubt eye-pleasing. The first half of the series is intuitive, spontaneous, and entertaining. At first, the story is confusing. It's not clear what you're watching but makes you connect the dots as you watch more. For one thing though, the animation is superb. \r\nThe themes are not clear cut, they're actually quite ambiguous. The show's themes require you to think a little bit and piece it together which can be challenging but interesting. It makes you think and each scene is meticulously made to probe thought. But as you watch more you'll find the themes resonate more as a coming-of-agestory surrounding the main character, Cocona such as gaining independence and exploring your place in the world and identifying who you in relationship to the people around you. \\n\r\nUnless you wanted this theme explicit to you, then this may not be the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, this anime relies on animation a lot to help the audience make inferences about the story and drive the momentum of the story. However, this also means that the characters are not fleshed out enough. I feel like the show had a lot of opportunities to grow their characters more but a lot of them are left without actual substance to the story. For instance, there are a few characters that come up that are seemingly important but if you were to think of their contribution to the anime as a whole, that importance may not be there. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the pacing of the anime is confusing (perhaps re-watching might change my mind about this). The first half of the series is a slow-build and it gets more intense towards the last 4-5 episodes. But as the series goes into the end, the story becomes messy and there's a lot of information thrown at you which can be overwhelming. Surprisingly enough, the animation quality is still consistent. But, there's quite a number of plot holes and ongoing questions that the anime fails to answer or give closure. There is some attempt to answer these questions but it's still very ambiguous episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the the series is highly commendable. It's intuitive, fun, and very eye-pleasing. The use of colors and animation is superb and impressively consistent. An ongoing problem with the show is that there's a plot holes in most of the episodes (probably due to their heavy reliance on using animation to tell the story) and become more frequent in the end of the series. However the ambiguity makes you think and urges you to piece it together. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, there is a tendency of throwing too much information at the audience especially towards the end of the series. The characters are not fleshed out that much but perhaps this was done intentionally to probe that \"coming-of-age\" theme.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, I would urge anyone to watch this anime. It's entertaining, amusing, thought-provoking, and fun-loving. Give Flip Flappers a chance!\\n\\n\r\n(Review subject to change after rewatching)",

I knew almost nothing about Flip Flappers going in, and to my pleasant surprise, the show made me want to learn everything about it within a couple of episodes. It presented something that felt so fresh and original while also displaying an unspoken variation on that of which it was derived. Building off of magical girls in magical worlds, Flip Flappers reimagined what came before it with a heaping amount of playful ambiguity and managed to stay utterly engaging despite how thoroughly confounding the show probably would\u2019ve looked to beon paper.\\n\\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the season exemplified this, as we watch the main character Cocona get dragged into a world of \u201cPure Illusion\u201d by Papika, a girl who\u2019s seemingly very innocent, passionate, and hard to communicate with. We\u2019re given about as much information about this strange new place (and the strange people entangled with this situation) as Cocona is, which is to say barely anything at all. \u201cPure Illusion\u201d is what the name implies, and exists in a space separate but connected(?) to reality. These two, who originality meet by Pure chance, have the ability enter these worlds and search for \u201camorphous fragments\u201d. Nothing is explained about what these things do or why they need to be collected, we just know that Papika has a desire to collect them.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is full of unclear motivations, be it with the immensely ominous organization of assumed villainy or the tiny group of underdogs that are seemingly the \u201cgood guys\u201d. It\u2019s all a matter of only answering the most rudimentary question of \u201cwhat it is they want\u201d. For most of the season it\u2019s not revealed why exactly they want these fragments or how they\u2019re going to go about utilizing them. With such bare-bone motivations, it might be hard to imagine just how this show could be so compelling without a firm grasp on the stakes at play.\\n\\n\r\nWell as it turns out, clear-cut stakes aren\u2019t always necessary in capturing a viewer\u2019s full attention. By putting a heavy focus on the characters, Flip Flappers directs its narrative spotlight away from the plot and instead concentrates on the two main characters and their growth. As Cocona\u2019s and Papika\u2019s relationship goes back and forth between love, resentment, confusion, and other neurotic emotions, we\u2019re able to witness Cocona open herself up and also shut herself in as she tries to make sense of what exactly is happening. Their personalities complete each other, as Cocona has quite the anxious spirit, but also just enough indecisiveness that she\u2019s able to be dragged along by Papika\u2019s innocent fearlessness. Together they take part in the joys of unbridled adventure, and no adventure would be complete without a few hurdles.\\n\\n\r\nAs if these random worlds of pure imagination weren\u2019t already dangerous enough, Cocona and Papika turn out to have some competition. Cocona\u2019s childhood friend Yayaka turns out to be some sort of trained hunter of amorphous fragments, and alongside her are two monotone sidekicks that seem to be robots because of their complete lack of compassion, but it\u2019s never actually delved into. All we know is that they work for that ominous evil group. Of course, only the audience gets a glimpse of this and not Cocona, but the villainous force behind these three is a massive cult with an unknown goal and an unmeasured amount of power at their fingertips. It\u2019s only to be assumed that they are in fact \u201cevil\u201d, but it\u2019s a pretty safe bet considering their outfits look like the KKK. An interesting choice, but race has ultimately nothing to do with the show. Instead what I think was meant by this aesthetic choice was to convey a sense of overwhelming and misguided desire for purity. Anyway, the mysterious ambition of the group remains unwavering, but Yayaka herself is not quite as committed. As the story progresses, she begins to show her feelings for Cocona and how those emotions are a detriment to their cause whenever the girls end up fighting over amorphous fragments. And that\u2019s about when we get into the final quarter of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the show set itself up to be until this point was something I thought was extraordinary. I felt like I knew so much about these characters in a raw, impassioned sense, rather than in a manner of just learning the cold, hard details. Flip Flappers didn\u2019t tell me a damn thing, and it really felt like the show expected viewers to understand the basic formula of the action genre because it wouldn\u2019t explain almost any of it. It would play with these illusionary settings to illicit certain response from its characters as well as convey things about them through the environment. Episode 6: \u201cPure Play\u201d for example, plays with color and memory, contrasting warm, homely recollections with cold, morose reminders of loneliness and pain, all by having individual characters and settings colored with either shades of orange or blue.\\n\\n\r\nIt was thoroughly engaging and thought provoking, as Flip Flappers treaded the not often taken path of showing its story rather than telling it. Not that either approach is necessarily better than the other, but Flip Flappers started with the former and I was hoping it would stay that way. Instead, it suddenly devolves into a very contrived exercise of needless exposition. Certain characters sit in a very mundane setting as one of them explains to the other their view of what exactly is going on, and why the fate of the world depends on it. Then the show flashes back to the cause of Pure Illusion and makes sense of how these characters got to be entangled in it, in a very straightforward fashion. The story becomes something else entirely, and while I don\u2019t think the final twist is at all a bad one, it lacks the narrative presentation that made the show unique in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers (I\u2019ll save that topic for another time), motivations are made clear by the end, yet the show still has some non-philosophical or particularly interesting questions left unanswered. Certain characters are introduced for what appear to be absolutely no reason. Specifically, a loli character with a ridiculous outfit that serves no practical purpose whatsoever. There\u2019s also an art student that\u2019s around for about two episodes then just disappears, plus we never really learn anything about the amorphous twins or what they do after it\u2019s all over. It\u2019s strange that the show is leaves these random things ambiguous, when just a moment ago it seemed to want to explain everything to its audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, while I think strong at its core (again, saving that discussion for later), is a bit random and what surrounds it is poorly thrown together. It starts to lose focus on Cocona and Papika, which was the most powerful thing the show had going for it. The center of attention stretches too far as it allows characters with almost no screen time up until this point to suddenly have important roles to play, which just ends up feeling like a feeble attempt to tie everything and everyone together. The show has three distinct characters\u2019 worthy of attention, and it probably should\u2019ve just kept that focus rather than throw in more needless elements that don\u2019t all entirely come into fruition.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a true shame considering most of the show was a Pure delight. The animation is superb, the action is incredibly satisfying, and the settings of Pure Illusion range from wondrous and awe-inspiring to very contained and deliberate in conveying a sense of characters and relationships. Not only that, some of the worlds seem to be forms of charming parodies, like the desert wasteland reminiscent of the planet Tatooine from Star Wars.\\n\\n\r\nNow before I end this review, I\u2019d like to give spotlight to my favorite character: Papika. She is a very interesting type of character, one that I can only recall in all my history of watching anime one other time. While she isn\u2019t explicitly defined to be this kind of person, it seems to me that she indeed has some form of mental impairment. Her compulsiveness, strange social behavior, single-minded persistence, and limited speech patterns; I\u2019ve only researched a little about it for this review, but I\u2019m pretty certain it has to be autism. And that\u2019s a really interesting and hard to understand perspective, not only to introduce in a story, but to create as a main protagonist. The way she shares the stage with Cocona demonstrates that regardless of mental impairments, they\u2019re both equals. Then their reliance on each other show they\u2019re both incomplete. And I guess I just find Papika to be the more fascinating side of the relationship because her disabilities and incredibly innocent outlook on life offer a perspective not as common as the insecurities that ail Cocona and define her personality.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Flip Flappers is unabashedly unique and adventurous. While I was personally disappointed in how thing play out in the end, it couldn\u2019t possibly ruin the intrigue and elation I\u2019d felt leading up to that point. Its settings are amazingly vibrant, creative, and push characters in smart directions while sometimes telling even more about them than the dialogue itself. The characters will certainly stick with me, and although I\u2019m glad their story was contained within a single season, I also can\u2019t help but long for more. Without a doubt, watching Flip Flappers was a\u2026Pure joy *snickers as everyone reading this rolls their eyes*.",

            "content": "This could've easily been a 10 if it flowed a bit smoother later on in the show. \r\nArt, Sound and Character don't need to even be talked about, every single character was so unique and likable, the ost was fantastic, I didn't like the op all too much, but I never skipped the ed. The Art is inexplicable. Violet Evergarden, heard of it? Fantastic animation, in my eyes it's the best I've ever seen. FlipFlap? The art style is nothing like Violet Evergarden, but in itself there is so much it entails. If you hadn't read the synopsis yet, some girls travel to a differentworld with so much variety to the point where you can almost make an entire anime dedicated to each and every adventure they go on. This alone combined with my score for art should tell you that the animators didn't let anyone down. I can't describe it in words, everything told a story. There were so many places they visited, all of which were packed with slight, well thought out details. Every frame interconnected fluently, and with all this came a wad of diversity. Near the end (no spoilers don't worry), Some of the characters' eyes start to slightly change color, and you can easily tell why. The art in this show is soo good, all I can do is look up to them and wish I could explain how their art is so much better than many, many other shows.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I know I said those didn't need to be mentioned but I rambled on about them all anyway. Now onto the two lowest scored parts, both of which I rated nines, Story and Enjoyment. I will combine these into one little paragraph as the reason I didn't give enjoyment a 10 is because the story didn't quite reach a 10. At the beginning, I loved it. I told all my friends about it. Don't get me wrong, I did the same at the end, but things got a little wobbly in the last few episodes (just like before, there's no spoilers, no worries), but, like all shows, the climax started to kick in, and it started to get wobbly. Many things happened and plot holes were cleared up, some of which made a lot of sense, but others seemed random. Things began to happen simply because it made the most sense, and it did, everything was fluent, but when I started to fanboy about it, I realized there were some things that made absolutely no sense. And when some characters were going through changes it often times felt rushed and/or pushed to advance the show. To be exact, I felt slightly confused and annoyed by this a total of 2-3 times. \\n\\n\r\nOther than these small little holes that arise when concluding an episode, or the show as a whole, the premise of the entire anime is (9) Great. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was eager to watch the next episode. The show kept my eyes glued to the screen, and this is without a doubt a fantastic show. Everything flowed together like bread and butter and gave so much room for creativity in such a masterpiece. There is so much imagination in the art, in the music, in the characters, in us, the viewers, and in every other part of the show. I hope everyone reading this gets to experience this journey of a show, it truly is something breathtaking.",

            "content": "This series was watched in Japanese dub with English subs on Crunchyroll. Thus, the \u201cSound\u201d category refers to the Japanese voice actors and actresses. \r\nFlip Flappers has to be one of my favourite anime series.\r\nStory\r\nThe story was good, 7/10. Each episode showed the journey Cocona and Papika going through the world of Pure Illusion in order to grab all the crystal shards. The story could have been approached a tiny bit better but I enjoyed the fact that it was not too clich\u00e9. The story appealed to me a lot, especially towards the end. \r\nArt\r\nThe art in my opinion was amazing. The art showing thetransformation when Papika and Cocona shout out \u201cFlip Flapping\u201d has a shoujo vibe to it which I am still am trying to get used to. This is where I felt where it could have been cut down and had a bit more of a realistic vibe to it but yet again, this part is basically the clich\u00e9 part where they transform and eventually beat the evil; nothing else. Thus, I suppose it does not need to be realistic and it is just my tastes that I need to change.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors/actresses were amazing.  It felt that the voices matched their characters. I did not notice the background music being awful. It blended in well with the certain scenes. The OP and EDs were not perfect but they were not all too bad. At first, I did not really like the OP but now I can stand it at least. The ED at the start does not really have a kicking explosive start but the chorus is where I decided to make the ED one of my favourite EDs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI felt that all the characters combined were well balanced. However, I felt that some characters did not react to situations in a realistic way. This anime, however, was not portrayed in a realistic way, but fiction. There were some antagonists were just there to be there, however, other antagonists did have motives. I also felt the supporting cast was perfect. They were not too bland. I generally hated the antagonists because of their evil nature. However, the antagonists needed to exist in order for this anime to be what it is or else their flip flapping adventures will become all for naught. (no antagonists mean they did not need to go on flip flapping adventures and just enjoy school life, making it become a slice of life anime instead.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI overall think this anime is very enjoyable. I might even re-watch it. I feel that others can also enjoy this anime as much as me. This is probably an anime to watch for people who just cannot decide what to watch. I recommend this to absolutely anyone. Cocona and Papika shall stay in my heart forever. These two characters are what makes the show enjoyable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "RE-POSTING this review since it got deleted (b/c Flip Flappers finished airing or whatever), but I\u00b4m just gonna leave eveything as it is, inculding my update after completion c:\r\nI'm gonna be straight with you, there's about a 50/50 chance that you will either absolutely LOVE this anime, or it simply just isn't for you and you'll find it \u201cmeh\u201d at best. I, for my part, happen to be one of those people who've been waiting YEARS for something like this. Fair enough, this has its very own reasons. So let me tell you about Flip Flappers:\r\nIn its core I'd say this anime is about PERCEPTIONand furthermore, PERSPECTIVE. We follow the main characters, Cocona and Papika (I honestly love almost every character in it, the twins for example are fucking priceless), and they go on adventures together in a world they call \u201cPure Illusion\u201d. Said Pure Illusion is meant to serve as \u201cvisualization of the mind\u201d ...although it's not always so clear, whose mind it may be (this time).\\n\\n\r\nThis is the basic idea behind it. I'm not going into detail here for fear of giving anything away, so let me do this review differently by starting with some \u201cnegative\u201d aspects:\\n\\n\r\n- ART: I get that a lot of people are probably thrown off by its look. This is exactly what happened to Madoka Magica. But while Madoka Magica did this to fool the audience in order to shock 'em later on, Flip Flappers looks like this because it needs to. If it weren't all girly, colorful and over-the-top, it wouldn't quite get its messages and its actual meaning across. Or at least not in the way it should be done. Which is why I think this style suits the anime perfectly, not least because it IS in fact a fantasy/sci-fi show, though, if you look closely, a coming of age story: very largely about self-discovery through overcoming fear, doubt and other obstacles. But before we're getting into spoiler territory I'm just gonna stop here~\\n\\n\r\n- \u201cFANSERVICE\u201d: There's seemingly random bits of fanservice here and there. Or really just some weird scenes in general :'D For example episode 8, which suddenly increases in ridiculousness and made even me cringe a little - not because of the fanservice per se, rather because it's paired with such a cutesy look. But here's the thing! The reason why Flip Flappers gets away with it is because it's all within the context of 1. the respective world they're in and 2. the anime's true intentions. Meaning that, if you cringe, then that's because it WANTS you to. The show's aware of how you perceive it and might or might not do something to oppose that (for example when Hidaka takes off his glasses in ep 12!!! GOLD), and that's genius if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nBut talking about true intentions, I'm actually done with everything remotely negative, so here's EVERYTHING I TOTALLY LIKED about Flip Flappers:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished the first couple of episodes, I had literally no idea what I had just watched. I thought it was something like Adventure Time, only with cute girls giving off some innocent yuri vibes, or rather, another yuribait and nothing more- but hoo boy, did I underestimate this show...!\\n\\n\r\nReally, it seemed so random at first, nonetheless so incredibly FUN. The show throws so many ideas at you, one after the other, similar to FLCL some would say. And for that alone it would've gotten 8/10 already. But then...you suddenly get it. That one thing the story itself may be truly about :-o And never ever in my life would I have dreamed of an ANIME whose story would actually, genuinely cover this exact issue, all the while doing such a great job at it. In fact, it's done so smoothly, I didn't realize it myself the first 4-5 episodes in, despite me relating quite well to it all.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a highly symbolic show with more than just one or two layers. It manages to criticize and \u201cplay\u201d with genres and TV tropes, and it does this in such a charming way!!! It twists the tropes around, averts, subverts or underlines them. You've got your references to Alice in Wonderland, Sailor Moon, DBZ, Evangelion, the KKK... Hell, even Mad Max! Yes, the plot is certainly not flawless and it leaves some things unexplained.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, nothing this anime does is unintentional. *Except maybe Nyunyu's entire existence lol. However, if you're able to read between the lines/look past the screen, there's gonna be one or another aha-effect for sure.\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE:\\n\r\nOkay so after having seen all 13 episodes, I think I'll have to lower the score to a 9, but hear me out! It's not like the ending was bad, I liked it. It's just that the last three episodes or so seemed terribly underwhelming compared to the sheer awesomeness that is ep 1-10.\\n\r\nThere were some pacing problems, the animation worsened (b/c budget I guess) and it left some things unsaid which I feel should have been adressed very urgently. But you know what? I don't give a damn. Good show, adorable af \u2665\\n\r\nThe ending could've turned into complete shit and I'd still love, love, love this anime 'cause I already got everything I wanted from it prior episode 10 tbh :') Ep 10-13 may as well could've never happened. But overall it's extremely rewatchable. I feel like I've missed a LOT of hints that may make me see the big picture even better once I rewatch it, so I will.",

Papika takes her into a tunnel that leads them to a strange world which she says is called 'Pure Illusion'. Here Papika tells her they must find treasures known as 'fragments'\u2026 they aren't the only people looking for them. It later emerges that Papika is a part of an organisation known as Flip Flap.\r\nAt first I thought the plot was boring, but boy was I wrong! Watching the first episodemade me say \"wow...\" and wonder what will happen next. Sure the story was normal, or more like a fairy tale one.

Cocona and Papika are the protagonists and they seemed pretty much the opposite of each other to me, Cocona is a calm and serious girl who's insecure about her future and Papika is a cheerful and energetic girl who's interested in Cocona. The two develop a strong friendship through their adventures in Pure Ilusion. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also Yayaka, Cocona's other friend, who's a determined and strong-willed girl. She's my favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nI wish we get to know more about the other characters, I have nothing to say about them..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall : 10/10\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly fun, the characters, the art, the soundtrack and the story.

            "content": "Flip Flappers is to say the least, a confusing yet highly enjoyable anime. The story is about 2 girls named Papika and Cocona travelling to other worlds to get these amorphous. Every world they travel to is unique and has its own gimmick. On the surface this story seems simple but it can be hard to keep up with. \r\nThe story is pretty good if you can follow whats happening however, to the normal viewer its hard to keep with the twists and turns. One minute you think you have it all worked out than suddenly, something else is revealed that makes you rethink theentire thing. At least it ended pretty good compared to other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is some of the best I have seen (To be fair though, I haven't watched many anime renowned for having great Animation). It looks great throughout and shines during the fight scenes. From the epic op to the final fight the animation is superb.\\n\\n\r\nThe op \"Serendipity\" is amazing, with the stunning visuals and the beautiful track. This is one of the few animes I watched the op everytime. The ed is ok at best though. It has some nice little clips but I found myself skipping it often due to wanting to move onto the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up Flip Flappers, it is an anime with a confusing but intresting story, stunning visuals and a relatively good soundtrack.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is an anime fairy tale.  It brims with wonder from start to finish, much of its action taking place across various fantastical dreamscapes.  The series features magical girls complete with transformations, but Flip Flappers neither follows in the footsteps of the magical girl genre, forgoing the emphasis on daily life and casual romance for full immersion into the magical, nor does it seek to be a deconstruction by setting its story in contrast to the norm of the genre, instead budding out into its own new branch.\r\nThe series begins episodic, each episode its own story with anything left unanswered at theend of the episode remaining unanswered, or cleared up in the unshown time between the episodes.  As the series continues the episodes gradually gain more and more continuity, up to the final third of the series where the episodes are undeniably tied together.  It is in this final third of the show that the story's moral question is brought into focus, as the main conflict of the series comes to light and is eventually resolved.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the most wonder-filled, fantastical, and colorful anime I've seen to date, Flip Flappers gets an absolute recommendation from me.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is equal parts confusing and enchanting, but those are perhaps the only constants in a story that isn't sure what it wants to be. \r\nThis underlying dissonance raises questions about narrative decisions as one undergoes the tumultuous journey: Why even introduce Nyunyu? Why was one episode randomly a drawn out mecha battle? Why dedicate so much time to building up and later revealing the backstory and ties of the shadowy, antagonistic organisation Asclepius if it is simply going to be cast aside as Mimi fills the role? What are the goals of these opposing organisations, anyway?\r\nPerhaps none of that should matter, because thefocus of Flip Flappers seems to lie in characters. This is an aspect the show does fairly well, with side characters like Yayaka, Iroha, Mimi, and Salt having remarkable stories. The biggest plot developments - conflicts and climaxes - involve character relationships that aren't necessarily tied to the bizarre, inexplicable premise. This, mercifully, allows some tangible semblance of progression.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to form, Flip Flappers' highlights are inconsistent with the rest of the show. The slightly terrifying episode spent in a dark, looping version of the school is masterfully done. The tragic experiencing of Iroha's story, and witnessing the bittersweet result of changing her past, is the type of content I wish Flip Flappers had explored more frequently. Mimi, Papika, and Salt's past is also a strong highlight, but suffers from the fact that it comes as a result of a jarring change of focus late in the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Flip Flappers is its most effective facet. The fantastic worlds Cocona and Papika explore are beautifully crafted, and the entire show has an endearing hand-drawn sort of aesthetic to it. Combined with some comforting music, Flip Flappers very occasionally commands a unique and magical aesthetic that sadly gets lost among the suffocating amount of intrusive questions raised.\\n\\n\r\nWhile its inconsistencies in everything from tone to pace do allow for its strongest points, Flip Flappers would have been better off picking one direction to fulfil. However, as much as it can feel like fumbling around in the dark, I would still say it is an experience worth taking to anyone who can see the light at the end and forget about the rest.",

Don't get me wrong, the first half is a fun FLCL trippy road trip through time and space but the second half is deeper and more heartwarming, more pulse pounding and overall just the better part of this anime.\r\nI nearly dropped this anime before the episode where they go to that desert world, I'm a fan of Henshin Hero shows so that one caughtmy attention to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to touch on is that this anime is one of the best representations of parenthood I've ever seen, not gonna spoil it but this show certainly is a fine example of just how far parents will go to try and protect their children even if it's not for the child's own good in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was very happy for a magical girl show in this day and age which is what I was dreading, not knocking Madoka but it's good to see some Shoujo heroine's can still earn their happy endings.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, and the op and art are some of the catchiest and smoothest things I've seen in a long time.

Without further ado, let's get into my review on why this anime is that awesome.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe story ain't anything special. It's just an adventure story between two girls. However, it is told in  an interesting way. There are episodes with their individual story but the story are still well told. Nevertheless it still kept me entertained.\r\nArt and Animation (9/10)\r\nThe visuals on this anime is just awesome. Each scene in this anime are well done. The art and animation are both unique. It doesn't follow the typical moe art stylenowadays. The animation sometimes reminds me of studio Trigger and it suits this anime pretty well. Don't believe me? Watch the PV. Granted that there are people who will not enjoy this art and animation style,  but personally I love it! The opening visuals did well in switching from the dark side to the bright side. The Ed theme is unique in using picture book style ending we normally see from Disney.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OP theme is catchy and the ED theme is cute to listen. The soundtracks are nothing special but each of the soundtracks is used in the correct scene. Never did a scene feels off because of its BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines. Although the character quirks are cliched, however it still can't change the fact that the characters are well developed and interesting or enjoyable to look at, particularly our 2/3 main characters.  The relationship between Papika and Cocona are well developed and cute. None of the characters are annoying or unlikable, at least in my opinion. However, beside the main characters, the side characters just came off as bland and underdeveloped, nevertheless they are still likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime to its fullest because of the art, animation, OP and ED theme music and visuals, and also the characters. So I will definitely recommend this anime if you want an anime with a cute girl and girl relationship and also unique artstyle.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is a story which struggles with its own identity. Simply put, it was most enjoyable when it didnt take itself seriously. \r\nThe main premise is that 2 girls, Cocona and Papiko are to make multiple trips to an coexisting, yet elusive world called 'Pure Illusion'.  The first 8 or so episodes really did a great job at unraveling this interesting world, and had me coming back to learn more.  Every episode there was a new idea of Pure Illusion- the haunted time loop house, the neo-city, and the monster filled iceland, were the most memorable for me. Ideas were getting tossedaround and it was a ton of fun. The interactions between the duo are cute and lighthearted.\\n\r\nThe art is also worth mentioning, the way this show handles artistic story telling, with a color palette ranging from vibrant to dull, is incredible. Action sequences are consistently fluid, with the use of flashy sakuga.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening, Serendipity by ZAQ, embodies the whole mood of the show pretty straight on, with upbeat electronic music, beautiful fight scenes and with the beginning lines \"into the sky\"embodying the sense of adventure I truly felt when watching the first 9 or so episodes. But after that point, the opening just serves to remind us that the show has truly strayed away from what made it great in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe story at some point, takes itself way too seriously. There is a hilarious lack of build up for the tension that arrives. The drama crashes in like a toddler who was testing the limits of a bike. It is rushed: the reveals, the explanations, the revelations, the resolutions. It never feels right. At some point, I was thinking \"what if they used their animation budget to make more episodes instead\". Everything good about the show I've said before, besides the art, just gets thrown out the window at some point. It leaves the viewer unsatisfied. Nothing feels complete, or established. The show becomes over ambitious- attempting a plot to wow the audience but leaves its former identity in the gutter and its viewers scratching their heads.\\n\\n\r\nFlipflappers is the guy in elementary school who is working on a perfectly fine art piece, peeks at someone else's, and ultimately ruins his own in an attempt to copy the piece he peeked at (aka me). Complicated plots are cool but there's no reason to fix anything that's not broken. I can't bring myself to give this show that low of a mark, because I truly enjoy a big portion of the show. But it is because I enjoyed it so much at first, it is more the disappointing that it turned out the way it did.\\n\\n",

The drawing is outstanding, everything is super-bright, colorful and shiny. Every frame is like a picture in itself, and every detail has a clear purpose in a visual sence. Playing of different of colors with each other has its own effect. Beautiful.\r\nBright charecters with charisma, sound, backgroundmusic, fairy magical story about traveling between worlds, everything besides art plays along with the art so that all falls into the whole anime in a seamless fashion. As long as it's whole and seamless it looks magical. Anything extra would be just redundant. Everything is done excellently and nothing is redundant hence 10/10.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers was an anime that got me excited about watching something on a weekly basis for the first time in the longest time. It seemed to be a show that had a lot to offer while putting up a deceivingly generic look. It had a mysterious way of presenting itself that subtly distinguished it from something we've seen too many times already. Sadly, the same can't be said about how things turn out after about half way through.\r\nThe show had a lot of quirks that would have you question if they are being subtle or just written poorly but it showed a lot ofsigns that they were self-aware of where it stands that were reassuring. I hate to use the word \"mature\" but Flip Flappers really seemed to have something more serious  with the themes that they were building up. A lot of the conflicts felt like they were leading somewhere important and \"mature\" to the point where ambiguity felt intentional. Even the aftercredit scenes that mysteriously never really got mentioned in the next episode felt like a narrative device that was going to be explained as an important part of the plot later on. A bit of a stretch, I know, but the show had me anticipate a lot of great things. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while still within a reasonably generic archetype, felt like something that belonged within the given universe. They were shown in a way that had me accept that they could very well be living people. Believable personality is something that is missed quite often in anime and I think Flip Flappers is proof that decent writing can make generic characters interesting and maybe even seemingly complex. There's something sincere about their overall behavior and makes a few cheesy scenes easily bearable. Though honestly, I'm just glad their personalities aren't dedicated to being simply cute. Though, I would still argue they are cute.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode was a different experience especially with its surprising range of art direction. Overall quality seemed almost too good to be a regular TV show. They're filled with meaningless but cool references done tastefully and a lot of clever composition and dynamic lighting. You may not agree with me when i say Cocona and Papika are interesting characters, but I don't think many can deny that Flip Flappers had some impressive visuals. The change in mood for each episode is handled very well and makes it hard to guess what will happen next. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of impending struggle which made it exciting to see not just the new settings but also how the characters will react within it. They all seemed to work well for a show that sells itself as an episodic adventure. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, things seem to go a bit shaky mid way and falls apart by the end. A lot of ideas and potential development seem to have dropped completely and everything just became extremely straight forward with a lot of underwhelming expositions that lack the same witty self-awareness it had before. Things that seemed important are either never discussed again or turned completely irrelevant. Characters start to literally explain the analogy  behind certain imagery within the show as if it had lost its faith in the viewer's intelligence. Even the visuals are obviously worse than previous episodes for what were supposed to be some of the key moments of the show. As harsh it may sound, it turns into a show that really could have been any other show. Basically, it became something I originally avoided to watch Flip Flappers instead. A straight forward plot and a straight forward dialogue aren't necessarily bad, but it's definitely not what I kept watching Flip Flappers for. \\n\\n\r\nThe drop in quality took me by surprise and disappointment. To summarize my experience with Flip Flappers, it went from being more like the ED song to being more like the OP song. There just seems to be a lot of thought put into the aesthetics to the ED while the OP is arguably generic and unfitting with the tone of the show. Ironically, the outro/preview music that comes after the ED is very catchy as well.  \\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like Flip Flappers and I genuinely did up to about episode 7-8. The rest is up for debate. Maybe I was just over hyping and over analyzing things. Despite what I have said, I would still recommend watching Flip Flappers as the first half of the show is worth witnessing regardless of how you may feel about the other half.",

The story line has so many great plot twist and will keep you watching until the end. The art is outstanding because the artist show many different forms of art in just one anime . The sound is really good in sub and works well in the anime. The character development is so complex and intertwined but not to much to get most people confused. I really enjoyed this anime and I give it an overall 10. This is one you haveto watch.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers. Yep, Flip Flappers. An anime about\u2026 something. With a name like that, Flip Flappers could be about a number of things. Most people would think it\u2019s some sort of children\u2019s show. But anime are children\u2019s cartoons anyways, hurr durr. But, is that really so?\r\nWell, this original anime by Studio 3Hz, which did Dimension W, that ran from October to right before the New Year of 2016 is a mash up of many genres. While MyAnimeList lists Flip Flappers as comedy, adventure, and sci-fi only; it is not actually so. I don\u2019t even know why it\u2019s being touted as a sci-fi anime. It\u2019s notsci-fi.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, this little 13 episode monomyth has basically got it all. Drama, yuri, comedy, horror, and you name it. Many people have resorted to describing Flip Flappers to be: \u201c\u2018Inception\u2019 met \u2018FLCL\u2019 and they both had gratuitous threesome sex with \u2018Kodomo no Jikan\u2019 in a liquor-fueled one night stand to produce this coming of age story about two middle school mahou shoujo probable closet lesbians\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I was paraphrasing up there but I bet I caught your attention with that. If not, then, go read the MAL synopsis again.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read the synopsis and thought that Flip Flappers sounds like any other mahou shoujo anime then you, sir, are horribly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s first talk about the story.\\n\\n\r\nBeing compared to Gainax\u2019s actual magnum opus, that is FLCL and not that trash Neon Genesis Evangelion, one would expect a lot from Flip Flappers \u2013 especially in the department of \u2018God, I have no idea what\u2019s going on but I sure am loving this!\u2019\\n\r\nWhile FLCL and Flip Flappers do share a lot things in many departments, the story is actually the place where they are the least similar.\\n\\n\r\nFLCL had a distinct style of relaying its story that heavily relied on comedic exposition through visuals and saucy dialogue. Flip Flappers adopted style and slightly changed it into an episodic format friendly one. With each episode, the style metamorphosed just enough to let each individual episode come off as its own unique portion that subtly builds on the world of Flip Flappers through creative use of varying scenarios in the anime\u2019s rather flip-floppy plot device (maybe location in this context?) called Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, this way of story telling is very confusing for viewers who aren\u2019t used to noticing every teeny tiny detail in a scene. Bring subtitles into the picture and the viewer tends to miss out on even more details. That means to fully enjoy Flip Flappers, at least second watch should be essential for most. I know I will be rewatching it as I think I missed out on a major plot point. And, if I didn\u2019t miss anything then Flip Flappers has a giant plot hole. Either way, not going go discuss that part due to fairness.\\n\r\nThis also shows the kind of issues prevalent with stories like the ones Flip Flappers and FLCL have.\\n\\n\r\nAt times the pace might be really slow and then accelerate matters into full gear in five seconds tops. For an anime like this, that isn\u2019t really a problem unless if the areas of snail-hood go into filler-like territory. This is, sadly, something Flip Flappers tends to do a lot. While Flip Flappers is director Kiyotaka Oshiyama\u2019s first full-fledged work, he still has had a lot of practice with anime greats like Dennou Coil, the Fullmetal Alchemist movies, and the second season of Space Dandy. He did a good job with Flip Flappers but, honestly, he could have done a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nOther than these points, Flip Flappers has an engaging story with a somewhat satisfying conclusion that\u2019ll require you to fire up some neurons to actually understand the story. It\u2019s nothing mind-blowing but you still get that warm feeling like the one you get right after an intriguing puzzle.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the greatest thing about Flip Flappers\u2019 story is that everything is in the anime itself. You won\u2019t need to go online or harass your neighbor\u2019s weeaboo pet dog for answers. In the case of FLCL, pretty much most of the story was almost entirely up to one\u2019s imagination. That thing was cool chaos in animated form but it didn\u2019t help itself by butchering it\u2019s coherence.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor a coming of age story, the main character has to be great. Coconoa is not. She is just okay and that wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if she wasn\u2019t the worst character in the entire anime\u2019s cast. Even the two twin villains, whose most recognizable trait is that they repeat the one another\u2019s line, she routinely goes up against are more interesting that her. Maybe if Coconoa was just a bit less emo for her age then she would have been loads better. It\u2019s true that she is empty and the anime is about her finding her identity but she wasn\u2019t handled well in that regards. The biggest moment of these to not is when she blows fuses a couple of time for tiny reasons which is something her character isn\u2019t supposed to do at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, Papika was handled much better better. While she was still a tad one-dimensional at first, she quickly rose up to shine as having the most and best character development by the time the last episode hit the credits. Going into detail about Papika would require me to spoil the story but I will say that she should be paid closer attention than Coconoa. The same goes for the rest of the characters. While being heavy cardboard cutouts, they each had their own funky charm. Hell, the Goddamned pet rabbit of Coconoa had more personality than her.\\n\\n\r\nNearing the end~\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs and the fun use of many saturated colors provide the animation with kind of spunk and whimsical intensity a show like Flip Flappers need. The animators knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have the time to fully realize their goal so many corners had to be cut.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, I watched the anime in 1.5x playback speed and noticed a number of places where the color was missing and things like a character having an item in one hand and not having it in the next were very common. You shouldn\u2019t be noticing things like these in visually heavy anime at increased playback speed. I\u2019d be damned if I don\u2019t say that at times the animation had many frames missing and it felt like I was watching at reduced speed\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was fun. I may snag the OST sometime soon. I didn\u2019t like the OP. The ED was just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is same as most stuff. The crazy scientist was the summit and all of the times Papika goes on her usual \u2018coconoacoconoacoCOnoaCOcoNOAAAAAAA\u2019 spiels was downright fucking annoying.\\n\\n\r\nTo end, I\u2019m going to say that Flip Flappers is a 7.5/10 in my book.\\n\r\nIgnore the rating and still watch it. It\u2019s a fun ride I\u2019d recommend to anyone. Except for lolicons.\\n",

            "content": "Overall - 7:\r\nThis show is a well animated, enjoyable mess of a show. The plot is all over the place and nothing makes sense, but if you look past that you might enjoy the show.\r\nStory - 3:\r\nI'm not going to try to dress this up, the plot is bad. In addition to either being far too complicated to reasonably explained or much too magical to try to put rules to the show focuses too much of its effort on delivering plot twists. I love plot twists, but in order for them to be meaningful the story has to make a reasonable amount of sense andfollow through on what those plot twists mean to the story. This show fails in both those aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot functions well when it's not trying too hard to deal with the bigger picture and just focuses on the fight at hand, and it does this well in the beginning. Unfortunately this didn't last.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7:\\n\r\nThe worlds the characters go to, the fights they have, and the character designs themselves are all top. The day to day stuff not nearly as much, but it's still functionable.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\r\nThe OST really has some good tracks in it, and the ending theme of the show is one of my favorite anime songs of all time now.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8:\\n\r\nThe characters are great, and the more screen time they get the more you understand about them and feel for them as well. This means that some of the side characters just aren't as appealing, and characters who don't get much screen time in the beginning can seem bland until they get their development.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also suffer from some of the bad elements of the plot, making their relationships to each other get confusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8:\\n\r\nThis show was very fun, and I really enjoyed it (when it wasn't too caught up with the plot). There were times where I was hyped up for the fight, amazed by the worlds, and choked up by some of the sadder moments. I was annoyed by the frequency with which the characters called out to each other (seriously, not only did this happen like every episode but they just keep calling out again and again).",

            "content": "I would recommend Flip Flappers to many people. I don't usually watch this type of anime, and I've mostly watched slice of life in the past, but I was immediately hooked on this one. It's a light-hearted, quirky, and often bizarre show. I was reminded of Alice in Wonderland in some ways.\r\nThe story is a thumbs up. The fast pacing and different themes (mechas, magical girls, sci-fi, fantasy, fantastical) prevented it from ever being boring.  However, it could be a bit confusing at times. That's understandable since it mostly takes place in other dimensions, so it has a surreal type of atmosphere. Even ifit seems odd, there was a purpose behind most of these themes. You might notice a common recurrence of 1) repetition/looping time and 2) a thine line between reality and the fantasy world called Pure Illusion, making it hard to tell what's real. I'll leave you to interpret the meaning yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of the story deserve a seperate paragraph. Many negative reviews are criticizing it's lack of a profound message, but that's because they're looking at it on a literal level. It's a Bildungsroman. Cocona, the protagonist, learns an important lesson and matures. This is a difficultstory to write without it being cliche and generic. But through clever and interesting symbolism, they make a unique coming-of-age story.\\n\\n\r\nI have no serious complaints about the soundtrack.  The OP and ED were really catchy, but the soundtrack throughout the show was nothing remarkable or memorable.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were one reason to dislike Flip Flappers, it would be the characters. I'll admit that Hidaka, or \"Mr. wacky science man\" as I call him, was a hilarious comic relief character. The protagonist was also a great dynamic character, as she should be in a coming-of-age story. The rest, however, were flat and cliche. You have Papika, the unrealistically hyper and optimistic girl, Yayaka, the misleadingly cold girl who isn't honest about her feelings, Dr. Salt, the badass guy with a trench coat, and then there''s Nyunyu. I don't even know what Nyunyu is supposed to be. She's a useless comic relief character who doesn't really do anything but act cute. If you don't mind slightly cliche characters, don't be discouraged from watching Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the voice acting. All of their voices are in-character and they have good acting. I especially enjoyed the voice acting of Hidaka, the wacky science man I described earlier. He perfectly portrays the eccentric, hotheaded, loud, mad scientist and genuinely made me laugh almost every time he spoke.\\n\\n\r\nA few parts seemed like subtle fan service but it's debatable whether you could call it that. Some clean-minded people wouldn't even notice it, and I had no trouble ignoring it.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the art. Thumbs up in that regard. It's colorful and unique, with Ghibli-eqsue backgrounds. It's impossible to be bored by an anime with such visually appealing art and visual effects. An observant viewer will notice many visual callbacks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Flip Flappers. It's not for everyone, but it's so refreshing and entertaining that I had to forgive it for its flaws.",

            "content": "I am having more fun watching Flip Flappers than I have had watching a season of anime for a long time. No question you should watch this show if you are even the slightest bit interested. I will attempt to convince you to watch it even if you aren't, but if all you wanted was an opinion on whether or not to watch the show than YES, WATCH IT. If you want to know why, read on!\r\nArt: The most apparent thing about Flip Flappers from the get is that it is immediately visually striking. The art is sharp and colorful, with elements reminiscent of bothsomething beautiful and charming like a Miyazaki movie and something sharp and flashy like Kill la Kill or any other Trigger show really. It is worth watching for the visual alone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My other favorite aspect of the show. The cast isn't huge, but on the whole they are both very well developed for a show of this length and surprisingly full of pathos. They get put in situations that give you the feels. The two main characters, Papika (basically a super manic magical Little Orphan Annie) and Cocona (who pretends that she doesn't want to go on awesome adventures but also not so secretly LIVES FOR IT), are strong and sympathetic. The secondary characters are just as well-rounded, particularly Cocona's grumpy friend Yayaka. A particularly great episode explored the relationship of one of the less prominent side characters and an elderly friend who is beginning to show the signs of her advancing age. I cried a whole bunch. I had coincidentally also drank a whole bunch prior, but as mentioned above it hit me right in the feels. To say much about the characters themselves would be a spoiler, but I suspect you will like them all if you get to know them. Suffice it to say, some of the best character work in recent anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory: In brief: two young girls, Cocona and Papika, find out that together that they can travel to Pure Illusion, which is essentially a series of fantastic and varied alternate universes. Craziness ensues.\\n\r\nWhile the story has been consistently uplifting and entertaining in equal measure, it could be said that it is also a bit confused. One of the particular selling point of this show for me is that each episode feels distinctly different in tone. While this does make for a very enjoyable watch, it does bounce around crazily between fun and sad and scary and cool a bit too quickly at times. The pacing is kind of frantic as well, but the nature of the show kind of supports this breakneck pace through the story. All in all I would say great but overambitious for 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening song is great, really puts you in the mood to watch something flashy and fun which is what the show offers. The ending credits are quieter but SUPER cute, and shows us the girls navigating a more familiar and straightforward fairy tale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe best part of Flip Flappers is that watching it feel like as much of an adventure as Cocona and Papika are having living it. It immerses you in its remarkably vibrant world and is consequently 100% worth your time, whoever you are.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers feels like a show influenced by Madoka Magica, and you would definitely enjoy it if you loved Madoka. It's a magical girl show that goes in unexpected directions, with a platonic romance at its center.\r\nThe thing that makes Flip Flappers enjoyable no matter your preference in anime is its aesthetic. It's a beautiful-looking, smoothly-animated show with lots of exciting action scenes. The characters visit various fantastical parallel worlds, and the art direction really shines through here. Every episode is a visual feast, even indulging in spoofs of genres like horror or mecha. The main cast's voice acting is great, not so much inthe sense that it transmits incredible emotion, but rather in that it really feels like they embody their characters. The quality of sound design in general complements this.\\n\\n\r\nSo Flip Flappers is a wonderfully-produced show from a relatively unknown studio, which is already a win and should have won them a bigger audience. Aside from the unseemly amount of shameless fanservice in a show about middle-school girls, my only real problem with Flip Flappers is its story. It's not that it doesn't make sense--it does, but you have to be willing to yield to the show's dream-logic a bit. What really bothers me is that the story doesn't proceed in an organic way at all. Characters simply go along with unusual situations without asking questions; important revelations fall flat because characters aren't given the time to react to them. The story doesn't really begin to take shape until the second half of the series, and by then I think there wasn't enough time to get through the whole thing. From then on, the plot becomes really predictable and secondary to the fantastic visuals.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Flip Flappers has inherently likable characters populating an amazing world, and it should at least entertain just about anyone who likes anime. The show also has a sense of humor about itself; the preview for the final episode tricks viewers into believing that they ran out of animation budget and it's going to be an audio-only, Evangelion-style affair. It's a very fun show, definitely more fun than Madoka in its first episodes. It just becomes a little underwhelming towards the end.",

            "content": "When I watched this series, I did so with skepticism.  had been introduced to the world of anime by friends who frequented phrases like, \"You'll like it, but it's very sexual and weird.\" and \"Sometimes, I'm embarrassed to tell other people I like to watch this stuff!\" Of course, this absolutely shocked me. I had grown up believing anime was a lot about large scale, epic fights, and messages of friendship and perserverance. I had been introduced to what some call \"Sh\u014dnen.\" The shows intended to fill the hungry hearts of young kids with empowerment! \"Yeah! anime's the coolest! I love Naruto!\" As Igrew up, I began to think it was cringey, that I was weird for holding on to these Sh\u014dnen shows. I hadn't explored much else of anime, I was worried and intimidated by my friends comments. There were some shows I held on to however. I fondly remember watching some of \"K-On\" and the \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\" was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Just as unfortunately as the fact that these nostalgic anime aren't on this site, I unfortunately did not want to venture much further past them. Flip Flappers seemed like a simple, and charming show to me. I was entranced by the animation and the creativity of the setting (known as Pure Illusion) and I was willing to give the site a shot! So I signed up for a free trial and entered into the world of Cocona and Papika. The strong, nostalgic feelings reminded me of my own life, and the shows themes of family and being yourself are strong. At least that's part of what I got from it. That's what some people want to hear, isn't it? How do I talk about the show without spoiling it? I want the people to have the same fresh experience as me, but I don't know how to sell it! I spent the review proving how much I don't know, but I don't know how to tell you what I do. Let's start like this. Flip Flappers made me love anime. It began cute and charming, and it changed into something I could not stop watching. It's my favorite anime of this season, and possibly my favorite ever. I sit here, writing this review, and I still feel there's so much more I want to say. But I want to get these feelings out of my head and ride on the melancholic, yet incredibly, powerfully, satisfied it's ending made me feel. I hope one day I may get to talk about the show more, but for now I just have to push it and shove it onto you like a weirdo who doesn't know what he's typing. I am a safe person. I tend to love the consensus masterpieces, but FF gave me a lot more than that. It made me interested in anime again. If there's anything I do agree with the consensus on though, it's that episode 3 was my favorite. I think there's something more personal and hard to explain about why I like the show so much. It's not that it's a magical girl show (I never understood or even watched many of them), yet something about Papika and Cocona are a lot more personal and meaningful for me. I've finished the show, and now that I have a Crunchyroll I don't really know where to go from here. It would be great to know if anyone had more ideas for shows I should watch from this season it'd be awesome! I'm just really new to this. I'm gonna watch every show I can. Shows like this inspire me to make my art better and to strive for positive relationships. I want to make the most of this site and I am desperate to find another show that makes me feel these feelings.",

            "content": "[This review contains minor spoilers.]\r\nI slightly regret watching this.\r\nI definitely wouldn't recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled.\r\nI won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nThe first part of the series is superb, assuming you enjoy fast-paced fantastical adventures.\r\nDuring ~most~ of the series [ignoring the final few episodes], the characters go on fantastical adventures that are made even more interesting through the series's great art style. Viewers learn close to the minimal amount possible in order to still be able to follow along, and this is great because by the time you're starting to understand one aspect of the series, clues about other aspects appear,keeping the experience exciting and fresh. The character types are played well and consistently, with each being unique enough to have its place in the series. There aren't any monologues - everything is figured out by the viewers and by Cocona along the way. We're never stopped and forcibly pointed at an explanation point - the degree with which things make sense depends on how much effort you put in while watching the series, also meaning that you can chose what to care about and focus on, and simply ignore other aspects of the series, all while still enjoying it overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good in almost all instances.\\n\r\nI liked the drawing style, which stayed consistent through most of the series. Character and camera movement during battles was also well done. In the final few episodes, quality fell a little, but was still good, since the baseline for this series was pretty high.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is great.\\n\r\nThe ending song and ending visuals are great. I got worried at first that the scenes depicted hinted at future events, but thankfully they didn't seem to imply what I thought they were implying.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nThe series shifts for the worse near the end.\\n\r\nThe feelings of wonder and superb stated-vs-implied balance that were so well-executed in the first part of the series are lost in the final few episodes. This shift is very abrupt and the problem persists through the end of the series, ending on a bad note. We suddenly get a marathon of previously-seen environments - previously, all environments were new and interesting, only appearing once. We see foes come back and be tossed aside again without any depth being added. Any sense of relative power levels are gotten rid of and replaced with the in-poor-taste model of combat exchanges merely for effect. The viewer, for the first time, is forced to focus on plot aspects that get mundane quickly [and won't be mentioned because spoilers]. The fantastical scenes in the end are suddenly tacky and predictable instead of imaginative and wonderful. There was a hint of something deep at the very end, when they return to the real world, but other than that, the series just trips over itself and ends - even that final gimmick was done too hastily to have any profound effect.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. I was surprised and saddened to see this series start off so great and then just fall over at the end. There are multiple ways this series could have ended, and I don't understand why ~that~ way was chosen. In addition to overall story planning falling, visual planning fell too. It was frustrating to experience because this series was close to being one of my favorites. Instead, I'm just left with a mixed, uncomfortable opinion about this series now that it's over.",

            "content": "Flip Flappers is intended to be a take on the traditional \"magical girl\" genre. That said, those familiar with such themes will most definitely be thrown through a loop, at least for the first 8 episodes or so.  \r\nCocona is a middle schooler with a seemingly unexplained past, who is met by the eccentric girl, Papika. Papika brings Cocona through to Pure Illusion, a world with seemingly limitless potential, in order to find fragments said to grant wishes. This leads to the two girls going on a grand adventure with many interesting experiences  \r\nThis Anime could have very well been a solid 9for me, however, the later episodes let me down thoroughly, making me hover between a 7 and 8. I'll go over what pushed me to go with 8 later, but let's start with the issues.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were unaware, around episode 7, the lead scriptwriter of the show left. Whether they were removed or left of their own accord, I can't say, but what I can say is that this change definitely feels like it comes off in episodes 8 - 13. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to tell how much of the story was planned out to end the way it did, as there have been reports some episodes being completely different from how they were originally planned. Regardless, in my opinion, the last 4 episodes of this show end up being incredibly disappointing. It's a huge shift from seemingly subtle storytelling and character building to shoving as much dialogue and exposition into every final episode as possible, almost as if they realised they wouldn't have enough time to fit their overly convoluted plot into a 13 episode season.     \\n\\n\r\nAnd it really didn't need to be so complicated. They just as easily could have closed off the series with an equally subdued ending as the rest of the story and it would have been absolutely fine. I'm guessing budget is a big issue, and it definitely shows in the final episodes. However, they still manage to make relatively interesting settings as a backdrop to the underwhelming exposition. \\n\\n\r\nSo after all that, why would I consider giving this show an 8? It's somewhat hard to explain. Throughout those first 8 or so episodes, I really felt connected with the characters and the adventure. Travelling through so many interesting settings and slowly understanding the story of each episode was really a fantastic journey. Including the fact that episodes 5 and 6 were up there with my favourite episodes of any anime I've watched. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish I could recommend just watching the first 8 episodes of this anime, but the entire lack of closure you get viewing up that point would ruin the experience. However, this is one anime I would be very happy to re-watch, now that I have that closure and I don't even have to worry about the later episodes. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, if you're willing to go through half of a really good anime and fine through wading through half of a not so great anime, I would highly recommend for you to watch Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Throughout my time of watching various anime, I\u2019ve occasionally come across series that, while they may not have been popular (or no longer talked about), I found them to be legitimately good despite the lack of a real following. People commonly refer to these types of series as a \u201chidden gem\u201d. This is a term that I find reflects Flip Flappers perfectly.\r\nThe story primarily follows Cocona, a girl who is unsure about her future and who\u2019s reluctant to make choices for fear that she\u2019ll come to regret them later on. One day, on her way to school, she has a chance encounter and meets Papika,a very tomboyish and action-oriented girl who takes her hand and leads her on an adventure into a fantasy world known as Pure Illusion, where the two girls are tasked with finding magical stones known as \u201camorphous\u201d that are said to grant wishes. Their adventure takes them through multiple dreamlike worlds on their hunt for the amorphous\u2019, where they face fellow hunters, dastardly villains, colossal monsters, and overcome their own pasts and personal adversities.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally think that the story in Flip Flappers is wonderful, I find the execution to be...quite confusing. There were times when I\u2019d be watching an episode and would have absolutely no idea as to what was going on. It\u2019s not that the story is badly written, per se, it\u2019s just that many important details about the plot, it\u2019s characters, and the world of Pure Illusion are explained in small details that can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention. There were multiple times while watching this series that I\u2019d have to pause or even rewatch a scene to understand what was going on. Also, while it should be obvious at this point, this anime doesn\u2019t spoon feed you the story, there will be times when you\u2019ll actually have to think about how certain story elements work, or connect the dots from the dialogues, since some things are not expressly explained, but can be deduced from the bits of information that they do give you. While it can be confusing, I certainly don\u2019t mind this form of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nI also find it worth mentioning that this series does indeed contain some fanservice and yuri undertones. However, since both are fairly low-key and not really prominent, I didn\u2019t find either to be particularly offensive in any way. It\u2019s just something that I wanted to point out for people (like myself) who are put off by absurd amounts of fanservice. Luckily, for Flip Flappers, it\u2019s nothing over-the-top.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe key characters have a reasonable amount of depth that gives each of them their own unique personality. What I found most enjoyable about the characters is how their friendships were portrayed and developed. At first, Cocona\u2019s friendship with Papika (her partner in crim-I mean adventuring) and Yayaka (her classmate) seem to take a lighthearted and predetermined route. However, throughout the series, they each have to fight and overcome their own personal challenges and feelings to retain and save their friendships with one another, which is an aspect that I personally appreciated seeing.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is perhaps one aspect of Flip Flappers that I enjoyed most. It\u2019s beautiful, vibrant, and has an almost dreamlike quality to it that I found myself enjoying more times than once. Some of the background art is simply wonderful and almost reminds me of a couple of Studio Ghibli\u2019s works, as well. In fact, there\u2019s a few background scenes which would make wonderful desktop or smartphone wallpapers.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the OP and ED songs fit the series well. I especially enjoyed the latter, finding myself humming the song on more than one occasion. Frankly, I didn\u2019t really notice the OST all that much, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It had the right tracks fitting for the scenes in question and...that\u2019s about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is truly unique and worth mentioning. At times the animation resembles works from studio Trigger or even Gainax (especially during the early combat scenes), giving the animation a very unique quality that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve encountered in another anime. I do think that it\u2019s also important to note that, while the animation was fantastic for the first part of the series, I did notice that the overall quality seemed to diminish in the latter episodes, which could be attributed to the change in studios midway through the series. While it still looked great, I noticed that in the more action oriented scenes, the animation had certainly been turned down a notch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I came into this series with next to nothing in the way of expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the end. With the myriad of seasonal anime that fall into either blatant mediocrity or in the realm of \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d, I can confidently say that this falls into neither of those categories. Despite the few small problems that I had with this series, I still give Flip Flappers a 9/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good fantasy anime that doesn\u2019t hold your hand or spoonfeed you the story.\\n",

The story progresses at such a rapid pace that it would often require me to rewind the last few second in order for my brain to keep up. Not to say this is entirely bad since the quick pacing of the show does allow for it to never become stale for a single episode and that every second of screen time is used effectively. Additionally, its ability to quickly change style and pull influences from other genres is a great tool that it successfullyuses multiple times. One of the best aspects of flip flappers aside from the obvious distinct art is the fact that every major character is well fleshed out and grows in some form throughout the progression of the show. The adorable costume design, characters, and world make flip flappers an enjoyable show to watch in the moment but doesn't quite have enough of its own identity to stand out beyond that.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI rarely, if ever, flop over.\r\nThat\u2019s thanks to my favorite chair at home. Its leather has frayed. The base squeaks oddly. I place a soft blanket on the seat because it hurts my bottom otherwise. For anyone else, this chair looks and feels like junk. But it has always kept me from flopping unnecessarily.\r\nFlip Flappers contains a lot of flipping and a lot of flapping. And, while it doesn\u2019t have its own chair to sit on, it likewise doesn\u2019t flop.\r\nSTORY\r\nFlip Flappers is a story about Cocona\u2019s maturity from childhood and into adulthood.\r\nA bold statement. Maybesome out there are saying to themselves right now, \u201cDude, what are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime begins, it treats the audience to something fun but not yet worthwhile. Papika and Cocona have a cute relationship. The worlds they visit are fascinating in their weirdness. And the death-defying stunts, the magical-girl transformations, and the silly-centered comedy provide many a scene that keep one\u2019s attention.\\n\\n\r\nYet, simultaneously, the makings of a subtler, more involved tale exist.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, the anime infrequently depicts famous trick drawings. Two faces stare at one another to outline an hourglass, and a young lady\u2019s pose makes her seem much, much older.\\n\\n\r\nIt also drops names that are too specific to be coincidental. Cocona\u2019s rabbit\u2019s name is Uexk\u00fcll, a reference to Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll who championed biosemiotics (the study of biological signs and symbols among species). Similarly, the evil organization chants Asclepius, a reference to the Greek god of medicine who was killed by Zeus for meddling with human immortality.\\n\\n\r\nEven the worlds themselves, while often rooted in goofiness and genre, tell more than they let on. A strange plain of existence with only white walls and floors stretches towards infinity, and a desert considers BDSM and invigorating potatoes the norm.\\n\\n\r\nSubconsciously (a relevant word for Flip Flappers if there ever was one), the anime feeds the audience these nuggets of intrigue. It slyly plants its threads, ingraining in the viewers the realization that the show is deep. Impressively so. A set of worlds and themes and ideas that cry out their avant-garde status.\\n\\n\r\nTake episode six. Cocona and Papika enter a gate within Pure Illusion. Within this new realm, the two simultaneously exist as a young girl named Iro, living out her dichotomous lives as a child. On one side, the destructive family home harboring hate and cold. On the other side, a kind old lady welcomes and warms the soul. \u201cIro is Iro,\u201d yet, when their neighbor succumbs to dementia and forgets their (shared) name, she wants to switch places with herself. While an impossibility, they at least remind their neighbor of their name \u2013 and accidentally alter reality as a consequence.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, and in just this episode, Flip Flappers targets the duality of life, the self, and how memories shape one\u2019s future. Pretty darn avant-garde.\\n\\n\r\nCrazily enough, the anime takes this approach all the time. It doesn\u2019t only dive into these dense themes offhandedly or sparingly. Indeed, it does so constantly, threading together larger themes on identity, thought, and perception.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode seven, Cocona, having lost Papika, encounters different versions of her friend. A younger sister, a delinquent boy, a destruction-hungry senior classmate. After meeting with them and hanging out with them, she still concludes that these people aren\u2019t really Papika, tying back to its theme on identity. The end even involves its theme on perception when it\u2019s Papika who finds Cocona since, to her, she was the one who was lost.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode eight, Cocona and Papika befriend a tiny scientist and defeat a massive alien. That scientist built that entire world, defying the odds stacked against his stature. In turn, Cocona and Papika (and Yayaka) do the same, obliterating their foe beyond recognition. Here, perceived capabilities are challenged as is one\u2019s thoughts on the task at hand.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode ten, specific plot details manifest as obscured truths. Papika unknowingly had amnesia. Yayaka pretended to be Cocona\u2019s friend. Cocona\u2019s \u201cgrandmother\u201d lied to her. These thought-inspired revelations tear down Cocona\u2019s perception of reality to the point that she loses her own identity.\\n\\n\r\nThe show contains an uncanny number of instances related to these motifs on identity, thought, and perception. Too many to both list here and dismiss as mere straw grasping. However, the examples from above should illustrate that Flip Flappers explores its many themes in both interesting and varied ways even late into its run.\\n\\n\r\nLike Pure Illusion, though, it goes deeper.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at these threads, they interweave, but it\u2019s not fully clear what bigger picture their knitting creates. Thankfully, Yayaka\u2019s words in episode five start to reveal the grander interpretation behind Flip Flappers. She says, \u201cOnce you enter a Pure Illusion world, you\u2019re influenced by its nature.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe most important word there? Influence. For Cocona, when she enters these otherworldly places filled with sweet snow and spider monsters, the environments influence her and the actions she takes. Often, she can\u2019t stop herself from living out Iro\u2019s life or squaring off against Papika as a mind-altering mask brainwashes her.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s more than being influenced; that sounds more like control.\\n\\n\r\nIt happens almost every time Cocona enters Pure Illusion. The snowy forest controls her movement, carrying her along the backs of giant worms. The haunted mansion controls her time, sending her through the same loop again and again. The plain of nothingness controls her position, locking her away as Papika and Yayaka clash. Even the whole point of collecting the amorphous \u2013 controlling Pure Illusion \u2013 relies on the concept.\\n\\n\r\nIdentity, thought, perception, control. Flip Flappers has enough thematic density here to hand out to every anime around it and then some. Yet, somehow, someway, it still doesn\u2019t stop.\\n\\n\r\nIn the final arc of the anime, Cocona\u2019s mother Mimi (officially) arrives. She takes control of the situation and of her daughter, reinforcing its themes once again. More importantly, her arrival forces Cocona into the last major conflict of the story: breaking away from her mother.\\n\\n\r\nCocona must leave her parents\u2019 nest so to speak. Only the nest is a boat in fantasyland and her parents are a tabletop condiment and an aural receptor. Nevertheless, Cocona must finally mature.\\n\\n\r\nAstoundingly, Flip Flappers has always followed this same story: Cocona growing up. Only it\u2019s been framed in that avant-garde manner the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nRemember those worlds in Pure Illusion? They also featured Cocona experiencing acts of a pubescent or sexual nature. Teething as a bunny. Getting all \u201chot and bothered\u201d around the ghostly girls. Laying on a bed, in nothing else besides a black gown, next to the succubus form of Papika.\\n\\n\r\nRemember those events in the regular world? She repeats many of her early actions when she has the same dream, puts on her clothes in the mirror, and heads off to school. That is, a routine which doesn\u2019t define her. She fails to find purpose in her future, tagging along with Papika on their adventures just because it\u2019s fun.\\n\\n\r\nRemember those themes throughout the whole journey? Knowing one\u2019s own identity is a part of maturing. Thinking more critically is a part of maturing. Understanding different perspectives is a part of maturing. Controlling one\u2019s own fate is a part of maturing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat at first seemed like just an anime involving a cute relationship, weird places, and action on occasion comes together as this smart, rich tale of a girl finally growing up. In other words, Flip Flappers becomes that bold statement: a story about Cocona\u2019s maturity from childhood and into adulthood.\\n\\n\r\nEven after all this dissection, two important points remain: the integrity of the narrative itself and the coherency of the connections made.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the first point, and being as fair as possible, the anime struggles on a basic writing level. It introduces an evil-organization subplot that the show not only fails to flesh out properly but also ends up meaning very little once Mimi appears as the main antagonist. The dialogue can also get quite bland as Cocona yells \u201cPapika!\u201d and Papika yells \u201cCocona!\u201d at least a thousand times (give or take) each episode. And the flashbacks present in the final arc mistime both their pacing and their position.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second point, it\u2019s worth wondering: Are these themes simply plopped next to each other to give the illusion that they form something more worthwhile? Well, yes and no. Yes, because the show does not go out of its way to bridge these separate ideas together. No, because the sheer number of examples is too large to ignore outright.\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what, it\u2019s clear that Flip Flappers tried to do something more, something different. If nothing else, that\u2019s at least worth a commendation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers maintains almost as much visual strength as it does thematic depth.\\n\\n\r\nOn an artistic level, the anime does about as much as it can. It makes use of a lot of vibrant, varied colors to paint both Pure Illusion and the regular world with intrigue and finesse. A rainbow-esque bunny-morphing machine world. Orange sands that drape over dunes. Purples and pinks and blues light up a strobed techno city.\\n\\n\r\nThe semi-soft style helps too, providing a calmness in its lush forests and underground laboratory. Attention to cinematography and shot composition make cuts like an upside-down reflection of Cocona off a puddle of water with a clocktower in the background the norm.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, Flip Flappers takes advantage of its lighting. Be it Buu-chan\u2019s lightbulb creating the silhouette of a skull around Papika and Cocona in episode one or how in episode two light fills the whole classroom save for the shadowy bar that covers Yayaka, the anime knows how to make the most out if its lighting.\\n\\n\r\nIts character designs are likewise impressive due mostly to their complementary nature. Cocona and Papika are opposites (short and long hair, bright orange and depressed purple). Their magical-girl outfits are awesome, too, with their swapped color preferences, frilly black-white-pink dresses, and hard heels.\\n\\n\r\nYayaka deserves a mention, too. She pins her bangs back, the dark-pink streaks that part her blonde hair serving as a reminder of her grey morality. Her black soldier suit with accompanying hookshots give that cool edge. But it\u2019s her later eyepatch, cape, and belt (now with only one hookshot) that turns her into the nomad who abandoned her \u201chome\u201d to protect the only thing she holds dear and highlights her character development with but a single glance.\\n\\n\r\nLike its storytelling, though, the subtler artistic choices give the show its strength. Looking at Papika and Cocona\u2019s magical-girl designs once more, they rely heavily on a butterfly motif. Butterflies on their hair, chest, and hips are visible, and the yellow wings that grant them flight make them butterfly-esque, too. And how are butterflies created? Through metamorphosis. A fitting biological act given Cocona\u2019s own metaphorical growth from a baby caterpillar to a full-fledged butterfly.\\n\\n\r\nOther details are affected as well. When Papika saves Cocona from falling into the black hole in episode seven, their spaceship is none other than the concrete tube they regularly stay in. Yayaka and Cocona first met at a hospital waiting area, so how coincidental that their main place to hang out with one another is a nurse\u2019s office. During the Iro-memory dive, Buu-chan makes an \u201cappearance\u201d as a yellow, four-wheeled cart that Papika drags along with her. And that big painting in the hallway of the school? It actually depicts Mimi floating in a pond after her (evil side\u2019s) defeat \u2013 which is exactly what happens event-wise. As if fate was saying that Cocona will inevitably win and will thus eventually mature.\\n\\n\r\nHow about one more example? During episode five, the anime recreates a famous scene from The Shining when Buu-chan wheels around a corner and sees the evil twins down the corridor. Another clever inclusion, considering the premise of this famous horror film (warped reality through insanity).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers is undoubtedly Cocona\u2019s story, but her two best friends make all the difference.\\n\\n\r\nCocona starts off in regular anime fashion. After taking some mock exams at her cram school and later speaking with her advisors, she\u2019s unsure of what path she wishes to follow. A fair spot for any middle-school-almost-high-school teenager to be in.\\n\\n\r\nIn strolls Papika. Or rather, she glides in, whisking Cocona away to Pure Illusion where she experiences a world she has never known. At first, she\u2019s apprehensive. It\u2019s too weird and too dangerous, so she wants no part in something that she feels will inevitably bring harm. Yet she has fun. A concept she\u2019s not necessarily used to as she follows the same routines at home and continues to lack confidence in her own future.\\n\\n\r\nBoth worlds challenge Cocona. Her dreams control her mind. Her indecisiveness controls her identity. Pure Illusion controls her perception. From very early on (albeit avant-garde), the anime centers Cocona on those important themes. She also starts to try new outlets and learn more about herself in the process. Yet, as she hesitates to reenter the realm, and her actions influence the real world, Cocona ponders whether she even should be here. Yayaka\u2019s constant warnings don\u2019t help matters either.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Cocona has Papika.\\n\\n\r\nPapika is technically the deuteragonist of Flip Flappers, but her role is less main protagonist and more ultimate supporter. And she\u2019s darn good at supporting, too. Papika is cheerful. Simple-minded yet sincere. She brims with energy and happiness, letting nothing demotivate her drive to enjoy life and all its wonders. Indeed, that\u2019s arguably her greatest strength: always moving forward and refusing to stop and wait. She finds it difficult to say complicated words, and she has a hankering for food (green bunnies too). But she always has Cocona on her mind.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s something regularly seen. In Pure Illusion, Papika\u2019s often the one who pushes Cocona along, grabs her by the hand, or otherwise encourages her to go beyond. She wants to be there for Cocona no matter what, for she sees her as nothing less than her most cherished companion.\\n\\n\r\nTheir foil setup is a classic one \u2013 timid, mature character paired with the outgoing, silly one \u2013 but it works. Papika makes up for Cocona\u2019s inability to have confidence in herself, and Cocona keeps Papika reeled in as best she can. While the two don\u2019t always get along, their friendship blossoms as they Flip Flap into their magical-girl alter-egos and overcome the different dangers of Pure Illusion together.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Papika can\u2019t do everything for Cocona. On the deserted island, Cocona finds herself way too far in over her head. And the different worlds see her controlled by bunny teeth and helmets and ghastly girls.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that Papika starts to regain her memories, and, in doing so, she starts to confuse Cocona for somebody called Mimi. Cocona gets upset at Papika for not being able to tell the difference, but they don\u2019t outright have a falling out. At least not until Papika fully unveils her backstory. At which point Cocona says those dreaded three words: \u201cI hate you.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll the while, the last important character \u2013 arguably the strongest in the anime \u2013 has made several appearances up to this point. Her name? Yayaka.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers characterizes Yayaka as a semi-delinquent who likes playing hooky and hanging out in the nurse\u2019s office more than she does thinking honestly about her next place of education. However, she\u2019s not completely without care. She\u2019s close with Cocona, grabbing her in worry and going so far as to note how soft her friend tends to be.\\n\\n\r\nYayaka isn\u2019t the same, and she says about as much on more than one occasion. \u201cMy mindset is totally unlike yours.\u201d When she reveals that she\u2019s working for the other side, the evil organization, she backs up her claim well enough.\\n\\n\r\nShe steals the amorphous gems when she can. She does not get along with Papika whatsoever. She continues to follow orders from her higher-ups. Nevertheless, Yayaka doesn\u2019t drop her friendship with Cocona. She warns her when she can. She also gives her advice and even helps sparingly. Despite all the bad she\u2019s associated with, Yayaka still demonstrates good. Moral mixing that easily adds dimensionality to her character.\\n\\n\r\nHer motives remain mostly a mystery in the first half of the anime, but, come the second half, the audience learns more about her and her situation. Her organization disapproves of her constant doting on and laxness with Cocona, stripping her of certain privileges and threatening her with removal altogether. And, through certain flashbacks, the show shows Yayaka befriending Cocona from a young age \u2013 to get close to her for the organization and thus earning her a \u201chome.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe climax of her conflict occurs in episode nine where she wages war. War against Papika, the girl who has \u201cstolen\u201d her own best friend, and herself, the girl who must choose what matters most. After everything, she shields Cocona with her body, demonstrating as clearly as possible the choice she has made.\\n\\n\r\nYes, Yayaka lied to Cocona. She admits that. But that doesn\u2019t mean Yayaka and her had nothing between them. Indeed, Yayaka knows deep down that the time she has spent with Cocona has affected her. Changed her mindset to one that\u2019s perhaps not quite unlike hers.\\n\\n\r\nThus, she does what she can to prove it. She helps Papika rescue Cocona as the enemy invades Salt\u2019s laboratory. Later, she makes up with Papika, rekindling her motivation in the process. And together they chase after Mimi to save Cocona within Pure Illusion because that\u2019s what friends do.\\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate proof of her full development writing-wise comes when she finally, successfully, officially Flip Flaps for the very first time. She cries out what\u2019s nestled wholly in her heart: that Cocona is the most important thing in her life. It\u2019s a strong moment not only because of the cool action sequence that follows her transformation but also because it definitively marks a satisfying conclusion to her entire character arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so it is that Papika and Yayaka save Cocona. One could argue that it\u2019s a \u201cthe power of friendship\u201d type deal. However, given the focus on Cocona\u2019s maturity within Flip Flappers, it\u2019s most likely more than that.\\n\\n\r\nBecoming an independent person is important for personal growth. But that doesn\u2019t mean one can do it all by himself or herself. Just as Pure Illusion requires partners to enter together, so it is that Cocona needed her best friends to finally escape from the control that trapped her, to finally allow her to mature into the person she could always be.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other, forgotten side characters \u2013 Salt, the twins Yuyu and Toto, Professor Hidaka \u2013 they unfortunately remain rather extraneous throughout most of the season. They\u2019re either given too little to mean much to the larger story or they receive almost nothing at all. Salt\u2019s growth comes through small snippets of flashback. The twins eventually look up to Yayaka. Hidaka is little else besides a mad (and hysterical) scientist.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, these characters get the attention proportionate to their importance. After all, the anime is really about Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. Meaning, it\u2019s fair that the majority of the extra side characters simply don\u2019t matter in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nTo that end, Flip Flappers builds its trio in strong fashion. They aren\u2019t as impressive as its narrative, and they\u2019re not exactly incredible on both an individual and group basis. But the show provides them with enough traits, moments, and changes to mark their characters as notable successes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nIt almost doesn\u2019t need to be said: the ending track of Flip Flappers wins in the music department. In fact, one could argue that it\u2019s the best trait of the entire show. Indeed, even the anime plays it one last time following the final scene rather than letting said scene lead the audience out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it so strong? Mostly the composition itself. The rising and falling tones. The whispering \u201cFlip\u201d and \u201cFlap,\u201d one for each ear. The fairytale instrumental work. Not to mention how the whimsical nature of the piece fits Pure Illusion quite well, and how the fun, almost playful approach invites its listeners to both bob their heads and sing along to its catchiness. While not as deep as the story of Flip Flappers itself, the ED is arguably the show\u2019s most memorable facet.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track and the rest of the original soundtrack don\u2019t reach anywhere near the same level as the ED, but they as well have their strengths.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP contrasts with the ED, incorporating a lot of techno beats and effects to create an empowering song. Its second half is particularly awesome. Rousing vocals, background cheers, and slight forays into lighter chimes pump the audience up for what\u2019s about to go down.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the OST, it contains a wide array of different musical options. Cocona and Papika transform into their magical-girl selves through a dainty tune replete with fairy sounds and twinkling changes. A slow piano piece rings out as worry takes over Cocona\u2019s heart in the cold and the trees. An acoustic-guitar version accompanies her bittersweet realization that Iro didn\u2019t keep her promise. A happy tune with woodwind instruments and light bongos plays as Papika cheers up Cocona when she feels \u201cempty.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting doesn\u2019t stand out as much as the music does, but the more niche performances certainly do. Michiyo Murase as Uexk\u00fcll the bunny rabbit waggles her tongue to hilarity. Kazuyuki Okitsu as Buu-chan sputters his name with determination. And the creepy \u201cqrE3TInqs\u201d girls of the haunted school make the audience want to close out the video right then and there from fright.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI am a fan of esoteric, artsy stories \u2013 and the same holds true for this tale too.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the show, I found myself having fun. Papika shouting about unfairness or running around without a care in the world made me laugh. I liked the action, too, especially when they started to transform into magical girls more often. But the real fun with these kinds of shows comes afterwards. All the digging and research and interpretations.\\n\\n\r\nThe further I investigated the anime, the more impressed I became as I found more throughputs, layering, and importance. I wasn\u2019t expecting it to connect an idea of control throughout itself. The overall purpose of the story \u2013 to showcase Cocona\u2019s maturity \u2013 is also something that surprised me as it all came together. Even the worlds of Pure Illusion. Their symbolism, settings, and similarities were far more involved than I initially thought.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, I\u2019m in agreement with a sizeable portion of the community: execution worsens during the last quarter of its run. The rushed pacing, to cram everything before it ends, doesn\u2019t make the transition go smoothly. The flashbacks are lame in their construction, too. And, while petty, Iro\u2019s neighbor\u2019s vocal performance got on my nerves.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, Mimi\u2019s involvement adds more layers to the already thick thematic sandwich the show offers to its audience in restaurant style. (But I still don\u2019t like the old lady\u2019s voice.)\\n\\n\r\nI do wish the show didn\u2019t get repetitive with its worlds. Two of their visits were just their own school and town (the scary episode and the multiple-Papika-personality episode), and the final arc simply reuses the other worlds that were already in rotation. Still, I can\u2019t be too hard on it. Given everything else it set out to do and accomplished, I\u2019m willing to give the show some leeway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd my favorite part of the entire anime? Toto, with a blank expression on his face, spinning wildly in the visuals of the OP. It made me chuckle and say \u201cWhee!\u201d every time without fail.\\n\\n\r\nFlip Flappers doesn\u2019t do everything right, but its drive for something bigger and better and beyond leaves a lasting impression. Robust thematic depth. Careful artistic choices. A stellar ending track. In the end, who needs a chair when one can fly so high?\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, small pacing problems and unimportant subplots aside, this avant-garde narrative about the growth and maturity of a young girl, supported by thematic density through identity, thought, perception, and control, provide a tale that, like Pure Illusion, is more than meets the eye\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, color, lighting, and artistry abound, but it\u2019s once again the subtle details that scream the loudest\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Yayaka goes through a satisfying character arc, Papika brings the support, and the two work with Cocona to help her mature, but the lack of attention given to almost all the side cast cannot be dismissed\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, great ED, good OST, okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, esoteric experiences are often the most interesting\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

I enjoyed the carefree feel that Papika created on all the adventures she brought Cocona along for, and this was supported by the art style which is a very soft and smooth art style.\r\nI never found an episode to be overly boring, some episodes had a good bit of length that was dry but most were filled with interesting moments with very little downtime in between. The show failed to seemlessly string together a coherent backstory by the time the show ended which I did not like, but it did not completely ruin my enjoyment of theshow.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the dynamic between carefree Papika and the up-tight Cocona while they have to go through the many different worlds in Pure-Illusion and find the crystal hidden in each world. The ending was alright, but as I said earlier could have been great if they had presented the information better, some information about the background was never given out at all!",

            "content": "I decided to watch Flip Flappers because of the beautiful artwork and because I was bored. There wasn't many series I wanted to watch during fall, and because the amount of animes in Summer that failed to live up to the hype, I didn't have any shows I missed to catch up on. However after seeing a little bit of Flip Flappers artwork I decided it might be worth a shot.\r\nWhen I started watching Flip Flappers I was impressed by the visuals but nothing else really caught my attention right away. However when a few episodes later I started to enjoy the missions they wenton more and more, Cocona and Papika became more lovable with every episode and by the end of the anime I wanted nothing more than for them to be happy. The artwork was some of the most beautiful art I have ever seen. The amount of detail that went into every scene was amazing and I often found myself re-watching scenes just so I could truly enjoy the artwork. This one's a minor not the biggest reason to watch the anime, but for some reason I found that the ED was catchy, cute and all around fun song to end the episode with... Definitely take a listen to the ED instead of just skipping to the next episode if you decide to watch Flip Flappers.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real problems I had with Flip Flappers was the poor ending and little character development the characters received. The ending felt rushed and after finishing it I found myself with more questions with answers. This is to be expected for a 12 episode anime as closing out an anime's entire plot that fast can sometimes be quite difficult. Also being a 12 part series, it's pretty hard to give every character the development they need. However with that being said, after ending the series we know almost nothing about the Twins, Toto and Yuyu. We met the characters around the first few starting episodes, yet we learned almost nothing about them. By the end of the anime I couldn't recall anything about either of the characters. Also this is more a personal thing but I wish they talked more about what happened to Iroha Irodori, her whole life was changed from Papika and Cocona, yet they never gave her the proper closer to her story... \\n\\n\r\nI really think Flip Flappers went under appreciated and definitely believe it's a hidden treasure of 2016. I really hope more people pick it up because this series definitely deserves more praise for it's beautiful artwork and exciting characters/story...",

            "content": "Flip Flappers: One of the few anime I have watched where every episode, I say, \"wow.....\" and wondered what was going to happen next. \r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nThe story follows two girls, Cocona and Papika, and their journeys through Pure Illusion. It is a magical girl anime where they transform into the \"Flip Flappers,\" but it is not the magical girl element that is the focus, but the common themes associated with the genre, with friendship as the main theme. The girl's friendship is tested time and time again, and every time they go to Pure Illlusion, we learn more about their and their bond.\r\nUnfortunately, themain storyline suffers from being quite subtle. For an anime with heavy imagery, it favors having the audience put everything together over keeping a straight storyline. The main plot isn't introduced until the second half, and many of the characters are put in the background in favor of the main three characters, Cocona, Papika, and Yayaka. I felt that characters such as the twins and the \"evil organization\" had little time to develop and play any sort of significant role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10 \\n\r\nI loved the characters, but I wished we got to know more about the other characters in the Flip Flapper organization. Let me break the main ones down for you though:\\n\r\nCocona: The main character. She's rational, afraid of making decisions, and indecisive. She has a kind heart and wants to do the right thing. \\n\r\nPapika: Childish, loves adventuring, and has no sense danger. Her spunkiness is her charm and biggest flaw. \\n\r\nYayaka: Strong-willed, determined, and knows exactly what she wants. She'll do anything to feel like she belongs. \\n\\n\r\nI loved how the characters were all foils of each other, with Papika being incredibly childish, and Yayaka being the most adultlike, and Cocona somewhere in the middle. However, they all struggle with their feelings and conflicted between right and wrong, and we watch the characters grow through the story, which was very charming. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, all the other characters has little to no development, but generic character arctypes. There's the crazy scientist, the artist, and that one generic guy in a Ku Klux Klan hat who does nothing but pretend to play an important role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the Pure Illusion characters. Since the girls travel to a different world every episode, these characters received almost no love at all after their episode. (If you've watched the show, I wanted to learn more about \"Pops,\" the scientist of Pure Illusion. He was so cool!)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the soundtrack to this anime. It was fun, bubbly, and fit the show. The opening is incredibly catchy, and I never skipped it. The ending gave me goosebumps after the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show deserves an award. I loved the colors, from Cocona and Papika having contrasting hair colors to the fun, craziness of Pure Illusion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nJust because I felt the other characters weren't developed doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this ride. While I believe the story suffers, this show is incredibly fun to watch. There's an episode where they even go Power Rangers style and make a big robot to save the day.\\n\r\nEach individual episode has its own world, and I enjoyed the interactions the girls had with the citizens of Pure Illusion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is worth a watch if like shows like Madoka Magica, or are interested in Magic Girl in general. It has a nice spin on the genre, and I highly recommend it for its strengths.",

            "content": "First off, im going to start by saying that for the first time i watched this anime, i got pretty much surprised. i decided to watch this just out of curiosity and didn't even expect anything from it. but the first episode actually surprised the hell out of me. and i will give my reasons as of why, and what surprised me.\r\nThe story to be honest, it looks kinda targeted for kids to me but it feels not at the same time. there is a gap between those two and that's where the story is. i said it's not targeted for kids or at leastteens at the same time cause of the combination with the animation. i feel like the animation made it so that person above, let's say 15 or 19 can enjoy this show too. And what makes the story looks different is because of the serious element in the story itself. usually, story that only targeted for kinds, well you know, it's just a normal story. more like fairy tale story. with out any serious problem or complicated problems but Flip flappers is actually have some of them. especially regarding the main character. even i got a bit surprised when they revealed everything about the main character backstory. so, i think overall, the story is really well made. although, i think the conclusion isn't really that impressive. it's just a normal ending imo. i only got impressed with the plot revelation. from that point, i think the show got really serious and pretty deep. \\n\\n\r\nbut i must say, the story has one mistakes. they didn't put any details about the supernatural elements. maybe more like world building ? i kinda feel like, with not doing that, there are some people who want to know about it so badly, but to me, regardless, i think it's great to not putting more details about it. so that it can gives a mystery elements from the story. and it will remain as a mystery even the story ends. i like that kind of story so i love it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe character. i think the character are amusing and interesting. when it comes to character. i don't really know much what to talks about it tbh. one thing that i must say, it's so catchy to the story and animation. overall, it think it has a very good characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound! just loved to the opening and ending song a lot. i didn't pay a lot more attention with the soundtrack tho cause i was pretty serious with the story xD but the opening and ending song are really the best imo. catchy with the show too. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character design. This one, is one of the thing which surprised me a lot from flip flappers. i didn't expect, a single tiny bit, that the animation would looked like what usually studio trigger or gainax made. this is one of the thing which got me excited with this show too. the animation looked awsome. this is rare tbh to me. this kind of show, having the kind of animation which is on the same level like one punch man. it isn't the character design but the animation. as for the character design, it's more like rough imo, but in a good way. which when they made it into an action scene, they just nailed it a lot. \\n\\n\r\nSo, from overall view, this anime is a rare one from 2016. the story was really interesting and always get me thinking \"what the fuck is going on?\" and made me want to watch more and want to know what's next. moreover, the animation always made me excited. they start the show with a good song and end it with a pretty nice song too. really like the set up. great show overall. 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nthis show felt like a disney show to me xD \\n\r\ngeneric ? full of cliche ? cgdct ? yuri ? at first you will think like that but when they gave you the backstory or revealed everything, that view will changed i think. only it just looks like magical girls but they don't even state that it's a magical girl so...yeah...i think they are using it to look more entertaining and i think they nailed it. at least to me tho. i don't know about everyone. \\n\\n\r\nif you are searching for new stuff, i will recommend this show.\\n\\n\r\nHope my review can be helpful to you.\\n\r\nThanks. Have a nice day :D",
