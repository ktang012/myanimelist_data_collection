            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Hidden Gem Review*\r\nTL;DR: If a young Hajime no Ippo made an illegitimate baby with the sexy cougar, Cowboy Bebop, in an 80's themed love hotel with Samurai Champloo music blasting in the background, then Megalo Box would be the gorgeous mixed bastard child that will emerge from the Redline ambulance nine months later. Such a hidden gem but packs so much hype. \"JOEEEEE!\"\r\n[Story: 6/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"They don't make tombstones for stray dogs\" - JD\r\nYes Yes Yes. This is that shounen sports anime this season badly needed to remind what real anime is all about. You don'tneed bad CG. You don't need blended CG. You don't need Ufotable level CG. What you need is a good mindblasting underdog story, eyegasmic hand-drawn visuals and eargasmic catchy rap music to ignite that flame that you put out long time ago to suffer through random sports anime thrown at you. Boxing anime can always be hyped. There is just something about two people beating the crap out of each other that brings out our animalistic nature to get that testosterone cascading within us and our blood viciously pumping through our veins. Megalo Box just takes it one step further. If you didn't watch it yet, then damn you are one lucky twat, because you get to binge this greatness and I'll tell you why.  \\n\\n\r\n\"I don't mind dying as long as I know that the faith I had in myself was real\" - Joe\\n\\n\r\nThis is an underdog story paying an homage to the 50 years of greatness to the boxing anime, Ashita no Joe, brought in the Japanese Anime Industry. It's a similar story however with one twist, mechanical box or gear attached to every boxer that enhances the speed and power of the user. Boxing is already bloody as it is, now imagine boxing with robotic limbs. \\n\r\nIt's a crazy concept but luckily this is not the focal point of the story and we don't focus on the gear too much but rather the boxer themselves. This anime follows the archetypal hero's journey but since they execute it well, it becomes a great strength rather than an overused flaw. The whole idea is that there is a Megalo Box World Tourney and our hero must fight from the slums where he threw boxing matches to earn money to face the number one boxer, Yuuri, in the new Megalo Box Arena. Will he be able to do it? Find out on the next episode of DBZ. Jokes aside, from training montages to flashbacks of boxers' background to understanding their purpose in life, you really get drawn to this linear rollercoaster plot that's constantly giving you knee-jerks to throw you off of it. However, if you hang on tight, albeit a few slip-ups here and there, you get to taste the rewarding experience.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell me your name?\" - Yuuri\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about Megalo Box are the characters. There aren't many but the few characters that are shown are really well fleshed out. They don't have as much complexity as other boxing anime have but given the limited number of episodes they have to work with, we get to understand their emotional baggage they carry with them. We have \"Joe,\" a junkyard dog coming from the slums that are cast aside in the society, Nanbu, his shady coach, Sacchio, a tech-genius kid  seeking revenge against the rich and lastly Yuuri, a Russian husky of a boxer, champion of the Megalo Box arena, itching to find the greatest opponent in his life to give a good beatdown. All of these masochistic characters have so much  charisma that they easily outshine the lackluster one-dimensional side characters thrown in this anime. Moreover, with a great deep-voiced seiyuu cast, this show feels so gritty and lifelike. Every time, Joe or Yuuri, speaks, they just steal the scene. Kudos to the seiyuus for not holding this anime back. \\n\\n\r\n\"If his punches were sharp, they wouldn't sound like a cow cutting through cheese\" - Coach Nanbu\\n\\n\r\nAside from the linear rollercoaster story and the gritty characters, the highlight of this anime are the animation and music. Seriously from episode one, the hand drawn animation puts so much life into this anime. Each panel feels picturesque. Each panel feels like it can be a wallpaper. The characters are so well drawn while maintaing the respect for Ashita no Joe and the use of lines & variation of pen-strokes just makes this anime stand out from other boxing anime that came out before them. It really goes to show how maintaining a good homogenous colour palette throughout the animation really pays off. The fight sequences are well drawn and choregraphed as well. Aside from the breathtaking visuals, the music is really freaking good. The OP song provides the hype and the ED song mellows us out but the background score and sound bits in the transitions are just addictive to listen to. This anime will have one of the best standalone OST to listen to. Couple that with gritty rap music thrown in at appropriate times in the anime, it catapults the plot and hype even further. If you don't get to watch the anime, atleast listen to the OST.\\n\\n\r\n\"Everyone's only looking out for number one, \\n\r\nso why stop now? You're still not done. \\n\r\nNo metal on your back so they call you gearless, \\n\r\nright now the way you act sure ain't fearless\" - Sacchio\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Megalo Box is a great sports shounen anime to watch if you are into boxing. Their purpose was to celebrate the 50 years of Ashita no Joe and they went ahead did just that and more. They brought back boxing anime to its roots and they showed us hand-drawn animation will never be beaten by commercialized CG animation industry. If you put forth passion and work hard to achieve a goal, then it will all be worthwhile in the end. This anime isn't perfect and everyone always enjoys sports anime of the sport they are into, but even if you aren't into boxing, it's enjoyable to watch as they don't delve that much in detail about how to box. So if you can get past the crazy plot of boxers using mechanical gears & one dimensional side characters, give this show a watch. After all, this anime isn't about the destination, it's about the journey and being the spectators we are in that megalo box arena, let's just sit back and enjoy. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",

            "content": "Art, in its purest form, is a catharsis of imperceptible cognitive entities onto a \u201ccanvas\u201d for the purposes of provoking reactions from others.  Sometimes that reaction involves laughter, other times it is sorrow, and on rare occasions, profound enlightenment, in either case, it is the responsibility of the artist(s) to determine the desired reaction, and how best to achieve it through their intended medium.  As one would expect, it permits a copious amount of creativity to take place, yielding unexpected outcomes that one would rarely see in the real world.  Antithetical to this branch of human intrigue, is the world of binaryresults and conventional outcomes, otherwise known as: sports.  That is not to say that all sporting events are replicas of past events, but in the grand scheme, one team will lose, and one team will win \u2014 end of story.  As is the case with a boxing match, one boxer will lose, and the other, by default, will win (I understand there can be split decisions, but for the sake of argument, bare with me).  In case I am mistaken, one cannot win at art, as it has no predetermined result.  \\n\\n\r\nErgo, making the mixture of the two (art and sport) quite the peculiar one.\\n\\n\r\nOne demands openness and originality, while the other requires an outcome.  Not to say that it cannot be done, as the predecessor of this series, \u201cAshita no Joe\u201d proved otherwise.  Yet, fans of the original series will be quick to point out, that while it was a \u201cboxing anime,\u201d it was so much more.  In a numerous amount of ways, the original \u201cJoe\u201d is akin to Ping Pong The Animation \u2014 a character driven narrative \u2014 as opposed to your typical sports anime.  Breaking free from the restrictions of defined outcomes and crafting something truly imaginative.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, how does this new iteration of \u201cJoe\" stack up on the hierarchy of sports anime?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to discuss the story first, mainly because I feel there is one glaring detail that demands acknowledgement before pressing forward.  I am referring to the \u201cGear\u201d (i.e. mechanical limbs) the boxers use to inflict blood-stained carnage on their respective opponents.  The concept, in theory, sounds interesting, but when one considers the ramifications, especially with the proliferation of CTE in athletes, it\u2019s a horrifying notion.  Imagine if \u201cIron\u201d Mike Tyson were equipped with this \"Gear\" in his prime, he would straight up murder people with one punch (cue the One Punch Man theme music).  In all seriousness, weaponizing the instrument of pain with highly sophisticated machinery, without providing protective barriers for the combatants is just ludicrous and a colossal oversight on the writer\u2019s part. I understand the rationale behind the decision, as it pertains to my original statement regarding originality, or lack thereof, in sports.  But, this innovative nuance is just a cosmetic flourish that adds little to nothing towards the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nBecause there are numerous routes the anime staff could have taken this idea, that would have elevated this anime into something worth remembering.  Perhaps, for example, they could have used the technology to profit from unnecessary conflicts and war, propagating political tensions and the fears of an overreaching quasi-government (this was sort of hinted at, but never really explored with any specific detail).  Boxing would have still been the main focus, but underneath, you would have an interesting perspective about the dangers of proliferating technology.  Instead, what we are left with, is a brother and sister competing for control over their father\u2019s legacy.  Then, much to the chagrin of the viewer, Yuuri decides to expel his integrated \u201cgear\u201d for the final match, making the entire concept an irrelevant element in a story that \u2014 desperately \u2014 needed vitality to successfully engage the viewer.  As the saying goes: haste makes waste.  The \u201cgear\u201d was the waste; therefore, invariably, the production must have been made in haste. \\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the story is your ordinary sports anime framework, by which I mean: a tournament.  Somewhat unavoidable, given the format of the show, but do we really need to see Joe get knocked down for a ten count, only to rise to his feet at the count of nine, in every single fight?  Watch boxing clips on YouTube and you will see for yourself that this sort of thing rarely happens.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nJoe, as they refer to him in the series, is reminiscent of a stray dog: he\u2019s tough, gritty, aggressive, and has nothing to lose.  Another characteristic of stray dogs is fear, an emotion that is briefly touched upon in Joe\u2019s first fight (his first fight in the tournament, that is), but is never revisited later in the series.  I would have liked to see this affliction be a recurring issue for Joe, a malignant hindrance that would have required significant mental effort to overcome his anxieties, potentially derailing his short-term goal of reaching Megalonia.  Unfortunately, the series allows Joe to conquer this obstacle relatively early, diminishing much of the intrigue in his plight towards the top.  In this sense, the story quickly dissolves from being an in depth character drama, and into a simple revenge story.  The reflection of emulating the original \u201cJoe\u201d proved too arduous for \u201cMegalo-Joe\u201d to achieve, disappointing fans of the original series who were looking for a show that retained its predecessor\u2019s desirable traits.\\n\\n\r\nGansaku Nanbu, Joe\u2019s manager, is your prototypical boxing coach: tough exterior, but has a sense of honor and virtue.  His actions are fairly predictable, and while they attempt to portray him as an indifferent character, we all know he will stand in Joe\u2019s corner, no matter the circumstances; thus, nullifying the astonishment of his evident, false heel turn(s).\\n\\n\r\nNanbu\u2019s previous protege, Tatsumi Aragaki, is the \u201cgenuine article\u201d of the entire series.  A man who was robbed of his legs and half of his face during a war, Aragaki struggles to find a reason to press forward in his \u201cmeaningless\u201d existence.  Much like the duality of his disfigured face, Aragaki leads a conflicted life, wanting to exact revenge on his coach through Joe, but also desiring a peaceful resolution that will alleviate some of his psychological woes.  The depiction of this character was spot on, creating a connection with the viewer in a palpable way.  The emotions that flew from Aragaki highlighted the fragile nature of all humans, reminding the viewer that one\u2019s own mind, can be the greatest opponent of all.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t engage in talking about the other character\u2019s of the show, as the vast majority were dearth of any real personality; however, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge Glen Burroughs coming out in a monster truck.  I mean, what was that?  We already know he\u2019s a boisterous American, but they really tried to hammer that point home.  Perhaps they watched some old clips of Stone Cold Steve Austin driving on his ATV to the ring, but just missed the point that the WWE was a contrived entertainment event, and not a real sporting competition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe boxing matches were, for the most part, uninspiring, and as the tournament progressed to its later stages, it became onerous for the viewer to tune in to the next episode.  Real life boxing is tedious enough (just look at the declining viewership numbers), but watching it in an anime format is all the more dreary when you consider the absurdity of the \u201cgear\u201d itself.  There were a few plot twists thrown in here and there, but nothing that made the viewer second-guess the outcome of the series as a whole.  Perhaps watching Ping Pong the Animation and Ashita no Joe has spoiled my standards for what to expect from future sports anime, yet, in the end, being judged by your peers is the only unbiased way of determining your place on the hierarchy of the sports anime genre.  And while this may seem blasphemous to some of you, I believe the first two seasons of Haikyuu!! capture character emotions with more veracity than Megalo Box.  One of the few times a Shounen anime did something better than a Seinen anime.  Not the legacy Megalo Box was attempting to solidify with its sights set on attaining the previous glory of its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.67/10",

            "content": "Edit: After two/three months of not watching anime, I finally got around to finish this masterpiece, and I still stay behind my 9 for this anime. I only changed one small bit in my review: I notched up the story from a 8 to a 9 for its great ending (well, at least in my opinion).\r\nI am a sucker for Moe/Slice of Life/Romance/Comedy type of anime, but once in awhile I like to tip my toes outside of that safe area. It introduced me to some great anime like Made In Abyss and not so great anime (*cough cough* Citrus *cough cough*). I tipped mytoes outside of my safe area again with Megalo Box and Megalo Box is a great one\u2026 actually not just great, an amazing one! Well, put on your boxing gloves and start your engines, this is my review of Megalo Box.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10  \\n\r\nIt's the typical underdog story, but executed well. Junk Dog is a really good boxer who does rigged fights for a living. When Yuri steps in the ring and kicks his ass Junk Dog wants to rematch Yuri. Yuri says he can fight him again in Megalonia, a boxing tournament. So Junk Dog joins Megalonia to fight his way up to Yuri for a rematch. The plot is pretty predictable, but who doesn't love a good underdog story?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10  \\n\r\nI adore the animation. It's incredibly atmospheric. The dark colors, the fallout like environnement and the low-but-actually-not-low quality. Some may complain about the blurry resolution, but it actually adds more to the atmosphere! This anime makes me feel nostalgic for something I never had nostalgia for. And the action scenes look incredible with some of the best fights this year already. Of all the anime I have watched this season and last season, this anime has the most impressive animation out of all of them. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10  \\n\r\nChrist on skateboard to Walmart, the soundtrack is amazing. The ED is reason why I started to watch this anime. The music in the actions scenes are great, the ED is incredible and that fucking tune in episode 2 is also incredible. The only song I don't like is the OP, which sadly knocks the score down a point. But for the rest it is amazing!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10  \\n\r\nA easy gap that a lot of MC's fall into is that they are boring. ''ooh look how so awkward and relatable they are''. Junk Dog on the other hand is probably one of the best MC's I have seen since Konosuba. You only have to look at his smirk. His smirk has more personality than the entirety of the MC's from most anime. A side character that I also really like is Nanbu Gansaku. He is a pretty knowledgeable coach who looks like he everyday gets home at 4AM. You also have the kids and for kids they are pretty likeable and not much annoying fucks. Overall a pretty enjoyable cast. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10  \\n\r\nThere is not much to say about it: I had a ton of fun watching this.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\r\nThis anime is amazing. Oh yeah, this anime is a 50th anniversary project of Ashita no Joe, but you don't need any information of Ashita no Joe to enjoy Megalo Box. That's all what I wanted to say. Get your ass off this site and begin watching this series!\\n",

            "content": "Megalo Box is an anime adaptation of the Nintendo Switch game 'Arms'. Not really, but it could as well be since both are about tool-assisted nu-boxing. \r\nFirst thing I have to mention is that I don't like this series very much unlike the 7 billion other people who are watching it. My favorite anime genre has been Sports since 2012, but this series is much closer to the Game genre. It mainly reminds me of 'Robotics:Notes', you know the 'Steins:Gate' alternative robots battle anime no one likes, and represents various things that I do not appreciate.  \r\nI have several problems with this series. Theseare: \\n\\n\r\n1) The way the boxing is presented. It's almost as if there is nothing else in the universe outside the actual Megalo Box. From its settings, it is like Mad Max with robot boxing. Cold and deserted world where there is only one thing in existence that everyone loves. This would be kinda cool if that one thing was some badass thing like shark-riding, or arm wrestling, or UNO with tea parties. I find it incredibly hard to believe that at least 96% of the population doesn't find tool-assisted boxing to be dorky as hell. \\n\\n\r\n2) The fights. What is this level of dullness even? Let me block until I die or alternatively one-hit K.O you. Ever seen the movie 'Real Steel' starred by Hugh Jackman? If you are watching Megalo Box, you are basically watching Real Steel. Later on, these fights start to remind less and less boxing and look like Beyblade instead except now people wear them instead of shooting them. \\n\\n\r\n3) The atmosphere. There is none. It's just about our main character acting tough like he matters. The main focus is on rigging the fights, and gambling. Mainly reminding me of Daredevil's past story from the movie Daredevil (2003). Apparently the real story only begins after this phase. Great. Basically filler-content in one-cour show. No matter how I look at the show, the first 2 episodes seem to serve little to no purpose whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\n4) The characters. Since this show is so heavily about Megalo Box, it even forgot to give past story or even a current story for the main character. It's almost as if our main character was discovered from nothing. How am I supposed to care about anything that is happening when the things I know about our maing character are a) he loves motorbikes b) he is terrible at driving them. \"Wooo! Go for it. I am totally rooting for you mr. bikes!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things that I liked too, but these are few. The OST has some nice tracks in it. That motorcycle scene in episode 3 was definitely a badass one. \"A man walks into a bar.\" Made me lol. I'd also like to praise the retro art but I simply can't. Japan is constantly getting blu-ray releases for 70's and 80's classic anime. Those who have seen any of them know that there is nothing sharper than old anime. So what did Megalo Box team decide to do? Add filthers that make the video seem partially pixelated, out of focus and colors look washed out. This is the furthest from retro.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Ashita no Joe, I didn't like Joe's character much outside pig surffing (heh, obscure reference), he was a real brick, but at least he was a character who had an actual life and who went thru enormous amounts of development, becoming a decent human being during the run. There is no chance of this happening in Megalo Box without having at least 3-cours. If this is how we're tributing Ashita no Joe, then I would much rather take 4th season of Hajime no Ippo instead of some marketing bait which relies on western appeal.\\n\\n\r\n*Please note that this is just my honest opinion. Many love the show and that's cool too.*\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s an infamous quote in the wrestling community that was said by the legendary Ric Flair. \u201cTo be the man, you gotta beat the man!\u201d While Megalo Box is not wrestling, there\u2019s definitely an iconic meaning that can be applied here. As I was watching Megalo Box, it reminded me the excitement of fighting. A few years ago when Hajime no Ippo returned on television, it became a glorious showstopper that lived up to all expectations. For Megalo Box, this was like a feeling of deja vu.\r\nThe premise of the series involves Junk Dog, an underground Megalo Boxer. He participates in a popular sport intheir world known as Megalo Boxing. What is Megalo Boxing? It\u2019s basically a sport that involves boxers fighting with metal gears. Think of it as boxing but with more lethal and brutal consequences. Junk Dog takes on the moniker name \u201cJoe\u201d so he can participate in the Megalonia tournament. Throughout the series, we see his life journey as both a Megalo Boxer and person. \\n\\n\r\nOn my first viewing, Megalo Box made an intimidating and fascinating impression on me. I haven\u2019t seen the original Ashita no Joe series before so coming into this anime fresh felt intimidating at first. On the other hand, I\u2019m also fascinated by the larger than life ideas of the show. The first two episodes immediately had me glued to my seat as we witness Junk Dog showing his fighting skills as a Megalo Boxer. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that the show portrays him as an underdog. The experience that Joe gains is invaluable and also allows him to realize his potential. I\u2019m also a sucker for the \u201cDavid vs Goliath\u201d trope as the idea can be applied in any sport. For Megalo Box, the stakes are raised higher because of how dangerous it is. Every fight feels as if Joe is putting his life on the life against opponents. And believe me, the characters he comes across with are no pushovers. Take Yuuri as an example. He is a Megalo Boxing champion and is considered one of the top fighters in the world. In a classic \u2018David vs Goalith\u2019 style fight, he humiliates Junk Dog in his match. The fight inspires Junk Joe to climb up the ranks and make a name for himself. It planted the seeds for Junk Dog to not only improve but also show why he deserves to be a Megalo Boxer. Junk Dog later takes on the ring name \u201cGearless Joe\u201d because of his own choice to fight without gears in the ring.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to be honest here and wonder what makes a good boxing story. Is it about the development of character in and out of the ring? Does it also involve a fighter going beyond than just a fictional character? Or maybe it\u2019s a story that always keeps up coming back for more. Perhaps it\u2019s how much the story draws lines between fiction and reality. Personally, I think Megalo Box has a bit of every one of those aspects. Junk Dog goes against his manager Nanbu to throw a fight and takes control of his own destiny. This is a contrast to Yuuri who often follows the command of Yukiko, the head of the Shirato Group who oversees the Megalonia tournament. There\u2019s a good contrasting comparison between these two characters as it feels like they are living in two different worlds.  It also impressed me on how much Junk Dog is willing to go to prove himself. This is shown later in the series when he fights Aragaki, with both physical and emotional stakes. It escalated to the point where both fighters eventually took on an all-brawl approach to see who the last man standing. In perhaps one of the most important fights of Junk Joe\u2019s life, he proves himself as a warrior. \\n\\n\r\nFor a sports show, there\u2019s no doubt psychology is also involved in the ring. The gimmicks, trash talk, and press conferences hypes up match-ups between opponents. A big selling factor also involves the emotional quality of the show. I can\u2019t help but root for Junk Dog early on in the series. He\u2019s the underdog and for him to beat certain opponents is relatable. It sends across the message that anyone can do anything they set their mind into. While this seems like a cheesy gimmick for the show, it\u2019s very real and the buildup for some of Joe\u2019s matches is executed flawlessly. On the other hand, Megalo Box does suffer a bit on the drama side if we look beyond the ring. Some of the subplot involving Yukiko clashing with the board of directors makes a less memorable impact to connect the series together. The family feud between Yukiko and Mikio also feels like it doesn\u2019t belong in a show like this. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I like a good drama from time to time but the way their plot is carried out just doesn't sell well. On the other hand, the rivalries between the fighters is what got me really invested into the story. Junk Dog/Yuuri, Junk Dog/Mikio, and Mikio/Yuuri are all rivalries that stays committed to selling this show. What I\u2019m also more invested in is how far Joe goes out to prove himself. He is very committed to his goal even if it means putting his own life on the line and taking jaw dropping risks. The guy knows what he wants to accomplish in life and to me, that\u2019s an attitude you need to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by TMS Entertainment, it\u2019s may take a while for viewers to get used to the animation style. The characters looks like they are hand drawn and creates a sensation of the 1990s. The characters are rough looking especially for our main protagonist, Junk Dog. There\u2019s no doubt the anime was aiming make the characters look as badass as possible. The addition of the gears these fighters wear adds more aesthetics to raise the stakes. However, the biggest selling point of the anime\u2019s technical quality is the actual fighting. It really isn\u2019t hard to spot how intense the action is once the fight gets into a momentum. Every punch feels impactful and camera angles captures the realism of the pain. It\u2019s never camera shy to show blood on screen and how fighters react to their win or losses. Every fight can get viewers\u2019 heart throbbing. The emotional impact can also be felt with the protrayal of human expressions. In terms of boxing, it also delivers its quality action such as uppercuts, corkscrew punches, jabbing, overhands, etc. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting how well the show\u2019s dystopia setting is portrayed without overemphasizing element of science fiction. Sure, the series place in a futuristic environment but also shows the reality of cruelness such as poverty. If the creators were aiming for making this anime feel real, they sure got their job done.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too familiar with Katsuhiko Manabe but the music talent he brings into this anime is undeniably stylish. The fighting music amplifies the hip-pop style of the OST to bring in a lot of attitude into the series. The soundtrack is mesmerizing that always keeps its momentum from the minute the first beat hits. In the meantime, I\u2019m also impressed by the voices of the character cast especially our protagonist Junk Dog. His personality matches with his voice that almost sounds like a fierce dog when fighting in the ring. The masculinity of all the fighters is believable because of the talented voice cast. Both the OP and ED theme songs also reflects a bit of the 1990s mood that may feel nostalgic. \\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box definitely turned out to be a dark horse that I\u2019m glad I gave a chance this year. What started out as a fight turned into an emotional story that follows the heart of an underdog. I\u2019m in awe of how much I became invested into Joe\u2019s character before even realizing his potential. While this anime may not be suitable for everyone, it\u2019s still an anime that can keep just about anyone at their seat. Here is a series that made a name for itself in just 13 phenomenal episodes.",

            "content": "I have never been interested in the sport of boxing. I didn't have anything against it, but, back then, the chance of me watching an actual match or something related to the sport itself would be as big as the understanding of the Internet of a 90-year-old grandpa. However, everything changed after I had watched Hajime no Ippo, as not only I truly enjoyed it to the fullest, but it also sparked an odd interest in the previously avoided sport. Naturally, when I noticed that in the Spring of 2018, there's going to be an anime centred around the said sport called Megalo Box, Igot hyped, set my expectations pretty high and well, they were met to a fair degree.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a narrative point of view, this show is a pretty average, bog standard story about an underdog boxer. You've got your protagonist, accurately named Joe (Junk Dog), climbing the leaderboards in order to beat the champion, with the help of his coach and support from his friends and fans alike. However, this is where the similarities to other classic underdog stories end. In the subtlely built dystopian world, they inhabit, there are power-enhancing mechanical arms called Gears. They serve both as a plot element everything revolves around and as a metaphor for the theme of \"fake boxing\". They are the technology that revolutionalised the modern concept of said sports discipline. If you wanted to be a boxer yourself, you had to buy an expensive Gear, because otherwise, when it comes to power and durability, you wouldn't stand a chance in the ring. It's an effective system from both economical and \"spectator's\" point of view. Who wouldn't like to see a brawl between 2 men with robot-like machinery on their shoulders? No one, therefore a system like that can have a place in the society and be a near perfect business, yet, with such an advancement came the loss of down-to-earth, genuine boxing, of which matches are decided by skill and effort put into improving it rather than one's equipment. The man using nothing but a pure talent that will shatter the concept of \"fake boxing\" is Joe himself. After being defeated by Yuuri, he decides to end his life filled with throwing matches in an underground ring and without any sort of Gear, he commences his journey to Megalonia, to encounter what a real (Megalo)boxing is, and as he pushes forward, he continues to prove that he's the genuine article; the real deal. Well, this is all Megalo Box is sadly about; it's a near perfect example of themes over attention to seemingly trivial yet crucial details. Even though I love such an uncomplicated yet ingenious concept when it comes down to matches and pacing, they are quite a rocky road. As the latter one is more or less solid throughout the story, the core of a boxing show, the matches themselves, more often than not, lack genuine weight, which may not reduce the viewer's enjoyment per se, yet they don't leave much of an impact after the dust settles. Such a situation would never take place if...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weakest aspects of Megalo Box didn't happen to be its characters. Don't get me wrong, they have amazing personalities and designs, but I've never felt invested in even one of them. Joe is the prime example of that. Throughout the show's duration, we learn little to none about his past, his origins or how he met his future coach. Why is he such a skilled fighter? Is he a natural born boxer or maybe he acquired such a level of talent because of the harsh environment? We don't know that, in fact, we know nothing. Yes, there's one flashback when we see the exact moment Joe and Nanbu first spoke to each other, but what about it? Well, besides discovering that he has siblings, we get nothing from it. And this lack of attention placed on creating the backstory made Joe, even though he has both the look and characteristics of a total badass of the 90s, which I wholeheartedly treasure and respect, into a character I can root for, but at the same time, am apathetic towards. Nanbu and Sachio, on the other hand, served their roles quite well and grew with show's progression. Both of these personages received something that our main protagonist could only dream of: proper character arcs. In case of Nanbu, most of the process of developing and humanising his persona happened both at and before the match between his previous pupil and Joe. We could see him in his now non-existing gym, work as a coach of Aragaki, a wonderfully introduced supporting character, and how big of a burden he carries, as he let his boxer down. And by the end of the journey, he morphed from a selfish scorpion that used others to save himself into a selfless man who cared about his comrades. Sachio is kind of a mixed bag for me. In the beginning, he was a pretty pesky brat, but as we saw his troubled past, we started to understand him and the reason why he thought of Joe the way he did. Other supporting characters are solid for the most part, well, besides Yuuri, who's only character trait for 11 episodes was serving Shirato family and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nProduction value-wise, this anime is an absolute masterwork. Both visually and aurally, this show oozes with such a heck ton of style and testosterone that I was left speechless many times. These retro-stylized aesthetics fit the brutal and harsh plot, shape the dystopian cities and slum surroundings and create an atmospheric tone to near perfection. One might say that the downsampling its footage was a grievous mistake, but to that, I must say no, even though I would like to see those gorgeous backgrounds in high detail.  Such a treatment gave the show it's unique unpolished and dirty feel and an unmatched personality, no other modern anime could offer. Every single track you can hear in the show is indescribably brilliant and blood pumping. I swear to God, my blood pressure skyrocketed into heaven's whenever one of these, especially Megalo Box theme and  Bangaichi theme, made an appearance. Free goosebumps!\\n\\n\r\nSo, to say that I merely enjoyed this series would be a blasphemy, goddamnit, I fricking adore it. There's nothing more satisfying and entertaining than a craft with visible effort put in, that is so enjoyable to watch, that you are, quite literally, waiting with an ominous anticipation every single week to see the next episode and there wasn't a single point where I felt bored or thought that the action I was witnessing on my screen was prolonged. Who's at fault? I guess that the audiovisual's played the most significant role in making me feel the way I felt, and hey, that's not surprising when we take into consideration how amazing they are.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile it certainly has its flaws, which can sometimes be a humongous eyesore, Megalo Box is one of the most exciting, fresh and manliest work of the Spring season, and heck, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of the sport, you will get pumped and hyped for every single bit of action out there. Full of raw, dirty and unrefined style, this retro like experience is, truly, the real deal.",

            "content": "I thought I'd throw in my two bits of info. Megalo Box is set in kind of this steampunk futuristic type setting where boxing apparently is still big...of all things. We've got our run of the mill down-and-out character who just wants to have a good fight. You might be thinking \"Boxing? Eh, not really my thing.\" To be honest, boxing isn't really my thing either. BUT, the character writing in this story is very well done. The animation is well done. Voice acting, at least right now, is believable. You might stray away from it because of how the art looks but don't letthat drive you away, that hand drawn stuff is done on purpose. It feels odd to say this but it makes it look grittier. Instead of that really polished clean stuff when they combine the 2-d with 3-d and everyone has these perfect faces, nah, this is the good stuff. The fights are some of the best animated sequences I've seen in a long time. They don't do that thing where someone throws a punch and it shows a still frame while the camera shakes to simulate the force of the punch, nope, its all animated and it looks great. The dialogue itself is not scholarly by any stretch of the imagination, but the decisions these guys make seem...real. They get sad, angry, happy, by regular stuff. I think when you just have an anime about some guys or girls that are just regular people it makes it a little better. I think for what they are trying to do can be fit into 12 episodes, but this is an anime that I wished was longer, and I haven't thought that in a long time.",

            "content": "In spite of all the hype that Megalo Box created from it\u2019s first few episodes, it became one of the biggest disappoints of the season. At first, it presents a familiar inspirational sports story with a vague setting to get you interested in the well-directed boxing matches. But by the end, the writing is still incredibly shallow. Megalo Box is just a carbon copy of the generic underdog boxing story, but slightly worse than the classics it desperately tries to imitate.\r\nAside from the addition of Gear, exoskeletons to enhance the boxers fighting, Megalo Box tells the very standard tale of a misfortunate boxer Junk Dog.He\u2019s wasting his talent away throwing matches for cash, a diamond in the rough who thinks he has no chance at making it big. He had long since given up his dream to become the champion of the boxing world Megalonia because he lacks the documentation to enter the tournament. When he happens to cross paths with Yuri, the current Megalo Box champion, they enter a heated rivalry that makes him feel enough passion for boxing. Of course, in their first fight, he\u2019s crushed. But now he has to climb his way to the top of Megalonia and prove himself worthy of a rematch. Throughout his journey through the ranks, he faces many foes and learns to trust in himself and others\u2026 you can guess how the rest goes even if you haven\u2019t seen it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an underdog story of the most generic mold, and it plays out exactly as you expect. Never was I surprised by any development, whether a twist in character or an outcome of the many boxing matches. Any nuances the show has are only superficial and do nothing to elevate the conventional plot structure. It seems like the inclusion of the exoskeletons all the boxers wear and other sci-fi elements were not to strengthen the story, it\u2019s more just for the sake of making things look cool. The only nuance the Gear adds is the fact that it represents a system that the protagonist defies by removing. Sure this makes him seem like a badass for fighting against mechanically power fighters and challenging the world\u2019s standards for the sport, but we already knew what the outcome of his fights would be anyways. Not to mention the gear doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s sci-fi without the science.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that predictability is not an inherently bad thing and sometimes beneficial in a story that sets out to emulate the classics. Being a reboot of the classic Ashita no Joe (which I haven\u2019t seen) it is expected to share some similarities to the older boxing stories. However, Megalo Box does not add to the formula previously established, it simply uses it to present a series with passable production values but writing that does nothing to surprise. It takes more than just imitating the best to become great, but it could help to be at least on the same level of quality of what you\u2019re trying to imitate. That\u2019s what Megalo Box is, desperate to be seen as one of the classics that it forgets to create an experience that can stand on its own merits. \\n\\n\r\nA muddy, washed out color palette covers the whole series, suited to the dystopian setting. If it was their intention to make the show look like a classic anime similar to Cowboy Bebop, they failed, deliberately downgrading the resolution only made the show seem fuzzier and less refined. A grimy washed out color palette covers the whole series, with a low resolution making lines fuzzier. There\u2019s no respite, even the supposedly advanced sci-fi city is unremarkable. Megalo Box doesn\u2019t get really violent until later in it\u2019s run, but even then its lacking the bite a gritty boxing series should have. The lines should be sharper, eye-catching, but instead, the art is soft and gray; its tiresome style would fit a show with less tension like a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nI spent more time trying to engage with Megalo Box rather than being engaged because the action it so heavily emphasized is nothing special. Even the fighting typically only consists of the basic punches and blocks despite the sci-fi tacked on elements. The animation isn\u2019t fluid enough for them to have the impact of the real thing, and they\u2019re not exaggerated enough to stand up against current shounen. For many of the fights Joe is typically beaten up and on the brink of defeat fight, struggling through most of the fight, only to turn it around at the last second with a single punch. This formula for the fights is repeated over and over until they lose any spark of excitement seen in the first episodes. Megalo Box quickly becomes predictable and frankly, boring, which is a death sentence for a show literally about sci-fi exoskeleton boxing. \\n\\n\r\nI get that a lot of the stakes in boxing stories comes from what\u2019s happening with the characters involved. But the people Joe fights are typically one-dimensional ciphers that are seen once and rarely again. Even the main character himself, Junk Dog (eventually Joe), has very little to him. He\u2019s your typical underdog who\u2019s lost confidence in himself because the world denied it to him, but gradually gains it back in combat. At many points, the series does a good job of cluing you into how he\u2019s reacting to the fights with close-ups and the exhilarating music. Whenever he\u2019s out of a fight it\u2019s typically very clear what\u2019s going on in his head because the situation he\u2019s in is already one you can recognize.\\n\\n\r\nI wish the side characters could have made up for what Joe lacked, but they\u2019re equally shallow with predictable arcs. Joe\u2019s manager Nanbu frustratingly jumps back and forth in progression, which to the show\u2019s credit, is suited to his emotionally damaged character. He\u2019s molded by the fixed boxing system to divide himself from the fighters he trains; struggling put faith in Joe\u2019s journey to Megalonia because he has seen how much power those in control have. Then there\u2019s Sachio, the token little kid with big dreams who follows Joe around ever since he saved him and his group of friends from the slums. His friends can be combined into one character because they offer an equal amount of development: none at all. Simply being there to cheer Joe on during matches is the extent of their impact on the show. They\u2019re not terrible as characters, they fit in the setting, have motivations and arcs, but they\u2019re so archetypal I couldn\u2019t muster up a reason to care for either of them. With exception of Yuri, the main rival who gets no motivation to fight other than 'he likes to fight.' Watching him fight didn't offer any excitement because I never knew anything about him. Even his manager Yukiko had nothing to her other than inserting evilness into the plot; she's selling Gear to the military? There was so much potential for commentary, but the show drops her side plot entirely by the second half; much like the rest of its compelling themes, Megalo Box simply uses them as window dressing to appear intelligent without bothering to actually develop them.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the arena boxing, the rest of the time is spent in the wasteland setting. There isn\u2019t much else occurring in Megalo Box\u2019s world other than the boxing, which is why everyone gets so excited over Joe entering Megalonia despite being from the slums. Frankly, the amount of people who love the sport feels a little hamfisted, the setting is never explained enough for it to be believable. There\u2019s no MadMax style apocalypse that has left everyone bloodthirsty scavengers, it\u2019s just the sandy slums and the big city which controls the sport. I wish the series had at least explored more of the implications about Joe not being a citizen and therefore not being allowed to join the tournament; it\u2019s an interesting theme considering the current state of immigration in Japan is not good. Sadly, expecting Megalo Box to add modern nuance was too much and that theme is resolved entirely by him simply receiving a citizenship after fighting a few times. There\u2019s a bit of fanfare on the plot development, but like most conflicts in the show it is easily resolved and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nAttempting to watch Megalo Box the way it wants you to, as a classic, is such a struggle. You can\u2019t love it without constantly making concessions, the visuals are deliberately of mediocre quality, the story is deliberately very cliched, the characters are deliberately barebones. Even if it just wanted to be an enjoyable homage to the classics, drawing such close inspiration from them will only lead to the audience unconsciously comparing it and being inevitably disappointed at how this new series just does not do enough to be better.",

I really series especially the manga for its great boxing matches, amazing rivalry, and wonderful and realistic character development. The series also had great darker portrayal of boxing as sport where not all matches will not end pretty as boxers can potentially get injured to a point where they get they lives destroyed. Thanks to these elements that the show offers as well being a great realistic coming of age + underdog story Ashita no Joe is currently my favourite sports anime/manga series period evenbeating  the likes of Haikyuu and Chihayafuru even thought I adored them but personally they don\u2019t compete the absolute greatness that is Ashita no Joe in my opinion. So when I heard the Ashita no Joe 50th project I was beyond hype because I thought my wish had came true where anime fans from this generation can finally experience the dark beauty that is Ashita no Joe in a modernize fashion. However instead of getting a Ashita no Joe remake we got Megalo Box a anime that was mean to celebrate Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary.\\n\r\nAs a fan of Ashita no Joe franchise I was really excited for it as it thought it will be great tribute to Ashita no Joe as well being its own thing and I first I liked it a lot. However as a I watch more episodes the show slowly started to fall apart to a point where all of my excitement of the show was replaced by boredom and disappointment.\\n\r\nSo what the hell went wrong with this show? \\n\r\nYou\u2019re going to find out now. Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Megalo Box and with that further ado let\u2019s started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows Junk Dog who is great at boxing who fights in underground illegal rings in fights that have a fixed result where his coach Gansaku Nanbu directs him on when to lose a fight. One evening he almost crashes his motorcycle into Yukiko Shirato, who is the head of the wealthy Shirato Group which oversees the Megalonia tournament; Junk Dog picks a fight with her bodyguard Y\u016bri who is also the top ranked Megalo Boxer. Yukiko stops the fight but Y\u016bri seeks out Junk Dog and meets him in the underground ring where he easily beats the less-experienced fighter and tells him to fight him again in Megalonia, which Junk Dog would need a place at the top of the official Megalo Box rankings to qualify for, as well as a proper citizenship ID to enter the rankings in the first place. After Nanbu persuades the mob boss Fujimaki to forge Junk Dog an ID under the name Joe, the two are given 3 months to achieve their goal of working their way to the top of the Megalonia tournament rankings in order for Joe to have his re-match against Yuri.\\n\r\nAm just going to say right now the story is only good if you never seen a underdog story in your life because this is by far the most typical underdog character driven story I have ever seen.\\n\r\nThe first big mistake that this show it\u2019s that is one of those climbing to the top to fight against the person who kicked your ass type of plot where the only reason why set character is even fighting is just to have re-match against the person who beat.\\n\r\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been so much of a problem if Joe actually grow as a character but doesn\u2019t because by episode 11 he\u2019s still that same bland fighter from episode 11. Yes I will admit he does change slightly in the final two episodes but it was far too late because he\u2019s character change just felt like a afterthought thanks to the show wasting it\u2019s time on dragged out subplots which while they were interesting it overstayed it\u2019s welcome. \\n\r\nAnother issue that I have with Megalo Box were the subplots. Don\u2019t me wrong they were pretty good but the problem is almost every single subplot in the show seem to overshadow Joe\u2019s progression meaning that side characters in this show were more fleshed out than Joe himself where he barely gets a spotlight outside of fighting. \\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t induce the other things such as pacing, and writing which were lacklustre at best \\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the show is predictable as hell where every single fight minus the plot convenience ones like the first Yuri fight start and end in the same way. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how a typical Megalo Box fight is structure.\\n\r\n1. Joe set up for fight \\n\r\n2. Joe practices \\n\r\n3. Joe goes to fight \\n\r\n4. Joe gets his ass handed to him for 99% of the fight \\n\r\n5. Joe wins with 1 punch.\\n\r\nSee the problem here. I usually don\u2019t mind shows that have a predictable nature but I feel like Megalo Box took it a next level where once you see the first two boxing matches not counting the Yuri fight you can very easily notice a nasty pattern for each fight and because of that the fights sadly have become boring and tedious to watch. I know this is a character driven show where the sport itself is not main focus but could you make the fight more tension? By the end of the third fight I got sick and tired of watching Joe\u2019s matches because he will only win by asspulling with that lucky punch of he\u2019s \\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this show is that it feels like a soul less cash grab to a beloved series. What I mean by this is that it has all the elements of Ashita no Joe but it\u2019s too afraid to become its own thing.\\n\r\nYes the setting is different and some of the plot elements but other than that you only just tone down version to arguably the best sports manga/anime ever made.\\n\r\nOverall the story is pretty bad and uninspiring.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters in Megalo Box I thought they were all underwhelming at best with two expectations.\\n\\n\r\nGearless Joe is such a terrible protagonist.  We the audience barely know anything about Joe from his past to how he became the person that he is in Episode 1. His motivation is paper fin as he only wants to the enter the Megalo Box tournament for a rematch against Yuri again in a boxing match. Not for pride or carrier reasons mind you just for a silly re-match a guy who beat you in the ring. The worst thing about him is he\u2019s bland personality and lack of actual character development because as from episode 11 he is still the bland boring character that we seen from episode 1 where he still only wants\u2019 to have a rematch against Yuri. Maybe I was spoiled because I seen Ashita no Joe and Hajime no Ippo first but in all seriousness Joe is a terrible protagonist who barely has any depth at all.\\n\r\nOn the other hand Nanbu is a pretty good character in his own right. Compare to the blandless Joe Nanbu is actually a charming and relatable character that is a great voice of reason for Joe. Also he has a well told back-story that actually explains in detail why he became the person that he is from episode 1 as a grumpy person. Easily the best character in the show in terms of character development \\n\r\nSachio is by far my favourite character because not only he is a another great voice of reason for Joe he\u2019s a very fun and likable character who get\u2019s well developed as the series goes on. Not to mention he\u2019s more interesting subplot then Joe\u2019s paper fin rise to the top to beat set guy \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters inducing the shitty rival Rishiki clone Yuri are all one note and forgetful.\\n\r\nOverall apart from Sachio and Nanbu the characters in Megalo Box were very disappointing at best.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Megalo Box is good and has that gritty feel that I liked.\\n\r\nThe art style reminds me off Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop with its more westernise and gritty look from the background scenery, some of the characters to even the use of gritty colour pallets. \\n\r\nAs for the animation itself this is where the show falls apart again.\\n\r\nAm not talking the animation where they not fighting in ring because that\u2019s pretty good overall. Am talking about the boxing matches themselves which were all subpar and boring. It was already bad enough that Joe easily wins his fights thanks to his asspulling lucky punch but almost every single fight in the show is lifeless and lacks any real tension. Am not asking that Megalo Box show relay on style over substance but if the show can\u2019t story and character elements right you just end up being one hell of a boring and lifeless show. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThankfully the soundtrack is easily the best part about the series.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great and well directed. It\u2019s really fits with the gritty of the series and it really makes the show\u2019s atmosphere more appealing to the eyes.\\n\r\nThe opening theme is decent itself but it\u2019s not that memorable.\\n\r\nThe ending theme on the other hand is amazing that has a great 80s vibe to it\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus did a pretty good job with the roles that they were given in this anime\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is great and memorable but honestly having a great soundtrack along will not suddenly make an anime good because saying Megalo Box is great because of the soundtrack a is like saying that Gundam Seed + Destiny  is great because of the soundtrack. While the soundtrack for those shows are great it doesn\u2019t have enough substance to back up its soundtrack\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nDisappointment is honestly the best way to describe Megalo Box as a whole. It was a anime that I wanted to love but constantly keep on disappointing me the more I watch it with its subpar plot, lacklustre fight choreography thanks to asspulls and mediocre overall characters. The only good things about this show are the music and the art-style.\\n\r\nAt best this show is below average and at worse it\u2019s a train-wreck that I dislike a lot.\\n\r\nUnless you\u2019re very new to sports anime I recommend you to avoid this show and checking out Hajime no Ippo or better Ashita no Joe instead of this disappointing mess of a show.\\n\r\nThe show may be just a celebration of Joe legacy but it doesn\u2019t excuse the subpar quality of this series. \\n\r\nFinal Score 4/10\\n",

            "content": "[Spoilers]\r\nSo what I'm about to say is controversial and make people angry, but Megalo Box is a boring mediocre anime and is such. \r\nArc 1: Story;5\r\nIt's simple and not really to revolutionary. It's about our MC trying to prove he's a good boxer and wants to participate in Megalo tournament to step in someones ring. And to add insult to injury the execution isn't really great. The decisions in anime are admittedly retarded and how can anyone call this a future great is beyond me. Compared to HnI or AnJ it really pales a lot in what it's supposed to do.  Really not muchto discuss.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Art and Sound; 6 \\n\r\nThe animation is really weird and sometimes outright ugly. Whoever directed this thought like an Instagram thot and told to put a ton of filters on the shows. The art would be better as it really can show, but the filters are ruining it. Honestly for being an anniversary project, It really looks ugly and flat. Heck the fight scenes highlight this problem as the way they fight is slow and stiff. The sound doesn't also have much as you can barely notice it unless they blare rap and an ost at a time.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: Characters; 4\\n\r\nHow can you write the dumbest characters in an anniversary? Joe is an alright character and Nanbu is pretty on point with both having dumb moments. Now the other characters are the epitome of fucking cancer and forgettable characters.  Yuri is literally just a dog of a rich girl and you really can't even have a connection with him at all. Fujimaki is the traditional gangster and Yukiko is the generic rich girl. Now Sachio is fucking dumb. Literally the definition of wow that's just lazy. He literally knows how gears work with no explanation and is now a second for Joe. Guys this has to be the laziest writing for a show that is rated highly and people are defending the kid too. Stop and address this show has problems with the characters instead.\\n\\n\r\nArc 4: Enjoyment and overall; 4.5 \\n\r\nThis is a mediocre show that has been overblown and I just can't stand how people are enjoying this show. It's boring but overblown. For a AnJ anniversary, this is probably the worst anime for that. Once this show is done I will do a full on review of this show and what it does wrong and why it's mediocre in detail rather than a preview. I doubt this will get better, but if it can fix the issues I found with the show then maybe I my opinion will change. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendations is AnJ and HnI as they both are way better in every aspect of what this show can't do.",

            "content": "...I gave it a few days to think about. I cannot give Megalo Box any score higher than a 4. I really wanted to enjoy Megalo Box. While I initially did, the excitement I had for the series steadily died out with each passing week. The characters got less interesting, the fights got less intense,  and it just became so predictable and lackluster. \r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters. We have Joe, the main character and focus. For some reason, he\u2019s basically made of adamantium so he can take hundreds of blows, get his ass knocked to the ground, but will always magically get rightback up as if it never happened. Meanwhile, his opponents almost always get one hit by Joe\u2019s well placed punch to go down instantly. Joe wants nothing but to fight and win. Every fight, he\u2019s essentially just a punching bag until he gets that one good punch. Joe makes all of these fights so damn predictable and boring to see. It was like watching these boxers punch a brick wall until they got too tired. They weren\u2019t intense. They weren\u2019t interesting. Joe wasn\u2019t interesting. \\n\r\nNanbu was the typical boxing coach. Harsh on the outside, cares a little on the inside, used to be a really good coach but is now washed up. He was probably the only thing worth remembering from the anime. He had some great development as the anime progressed. \\n\r\nSachio brought nothing to the anime. His role was to scream Joe\u2019s name constantly whenever Joe got knocked down. That\u2019s basically all. There was a subplot with him and his parents at one point, but it really served no purpose whatsoever in terms of story or character development.\\n\r\nAll the other boxers were kind of interesting to see. The ones from different countries actually spoke their original language which was really cool. However, none of them really differed in the ring. I know boxing can be very straightforward, but the anime really should\u2019ve taken the liberty to focus on all the types of fighting styles of each boxer. That would\u2019ve made them stand out more and perhaps even remember their damn names outside the central \u201cantagonist\u201d Yuri.\\n\r\nThe story offered nothing of interest to me. The premise was promising at first, a normal boxer taking on these boxers with mechanical \u201cgears\u201d to deliver powerful blows, but as I talked about earlier, the fights all followed a similar pattern. Joe get demolished during the fight, gets knocked down, Sachio screams, Joe gets back up, hits the opponent in the face to win. Rinse and repeat. There was one fight earlier in the anime that went against this formula and I truly wish the anime made the other fights stand out more like that one. There were a few plot twists outside the boxing ring, but nothing major enough to last more than an episode before moving on to the next fight.\\n\r\nBy now, everyone knows about the art style of Megalo Box. It\u2019s a nice callback. At times however, you really wish it weren\u2019t. The video quality really suffered at times in order to capture that feel of a 90\u2019s anime. This will be the one thing people will recall about the anime a year down the line. It\u2019ll be the thing people praise it for. It\u2019s simply just a nice touch in my mind.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was the best thing about the anime. That alone was better than anything in the anime and deserves its own score. Sadly, the soundtrack alone can\u2019t make the fights exciting or make the characters shine. \\n\r\nOverall, Megalo Box was disappointing. To me, it felt like wasted potential the farther I got into the series. Even the final battle in Episode 13 was disappointing. Megalo Box is an anime about dropping the ball. It sets up for some amazing fights and potential greatness just to drop the ball. And it does so over and over. It\u2019ll pick up the ball, make the viewers excited about what it could possibly do with said ball, just to drop it onto the floor as it always has. After awhile, you just expect Megalo Box to drop the ball each time and it just becomes dull and forgettable.\\n\r\nBut at least there was good music playing.",

            "content": "This is an outstanding anime. It feels nostalgic without feeling old, it feels gritty without feeling rusty, it feels grounded without feeling basic. Everything it sets out to do it does perfectly - and at that point it never forgets what it wants to be.\r\nStory is a 9/10 so far because it gave itself enough time to give us setpieces, and made them easy to understand. We have clear motivations for all characters and we dont just have \"good guy, bad guy\". We have a clear goal for the whole series and the struggle is very apparent as well. It is told without hesitation, whichdoes in small occasions feel too hasty - but its still at a reasonable pace and fits to a specific time-dependent portion of the story too.\\n\r\nTheres nothing unnecessary in this story and everything thats there is there for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt is a 10/10. Its stylized, well themed, beautiful to look at, and not even once does it feel janky. Animations aren't just beautiful though: Every kind of motion has weight and meaning behind it. This is what anime can be when looked beyond conventions.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a 10/10 as well. Everything sounds heavy, the fights have a really strong sound design. The music goes for a clearly specific feel, and while it might not be everyones taste, it serves a very specific purpose for the quite underground feel of our MC.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the 10/10 characters, which are, honestly, probably the highlight of the entire series. By themselves they might seem \"bare bones\" but they are clear personalities that are in stark contrast to each other. They have conflict, individual interests and interact in a very unpredictable way that makes them go beyond \"good and bad guys\" - we don't follow the MC because he is the good guy. We follow the MC because he sets out to be the guy.\\n\\n\r\nI can only recommend this anime to everyone. Even though this is a boxing anime, don't expect something like Hajime no Ippo. In HnI, the fights have long build up, the fights are slow and each punch is shown to have real heavy hits. In Megalo Box, its not about the individual fights - albeit being gorgeous and incredibly choreographed. It's about the path to the top, and everything in this anime aids this single purpose. If you want incredibly deep boxing matchups with unique techniques that have to be \"figured out\" this might not be for you, but if you want a fighters spirit anime about a struggling stray dog, this is the perfect choice.",

            "content": "Megalo Box has very little to do with the art of fighting itself. There is no emphasis on technique. There is no weight training. There is no satisfying payout following the arduous process of a fighter desperately trying (and often, failing) to improve their skill. There is the bizzare inclusion of gear technology that grants fighters additional strength at cost of speed - a useless consequence with speed being paramount in combat. So how can an anime that revolves around fighting, but offers none of the impertinent detail of fighting, and is decidedly worse than its predecessors Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe intheir depictions of fighting, be celebrated as one of the best releases of the year?\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box succeeds in three areas that usually manage to garner an overwhelmingly favorable response from the audience regardless of the surrounding flaws -\\n\\n\r\n1) Appealing visual aesthetic. This is an attractive looking anime with well defined, distinct looking character designs and a realistic impoverished setting juxtaposed against the futuristic wealth of Megalonia\\n\\n\r\n2) Epic soundtrack. A contender for best of the year, striking an impressive balance of relaxing and blood throttling beats\\n\\n\r\n3) No nonsense lead character who has to fight his way to the top, seemingly against all the odds\\n\\n\r\nA combination of the first two makes the anime feel atmospheric, immersing the viewer into the setting and creating a base level of entertainment from visuals and music alone. The impressive presentation makes it all the more disappointing that the fight animation is rigid and monotonous, more so resembling a match of rock em' sock em' robots than an actual high octane competition. This may even be an insult to rock em' sock em' where at the very least arms move rapidly. Slow motion is overused during fights as opposed to displaying the rapid fire jab strings and punch combinations that makes boxing so exhilarating to watch. The aforementioned lack of technique means scarce evasion tactics are used, eliminating arguably the most exciting aspect of fighting where an ill-timed whiff is met with a devastating punish. The fights in Megalo Box are rather forgettable, and at times even a chore to watch. You\u2019d think this would be a death knell for an anime that is centered around hand to hand combat, but this is apparently less important than a pretty aesthetic, a downloadable soundtrack and a lead character that doesn't have bitchmade tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the selling point of an underdog fighting his way the top against the odds, in truth Joe is disadvantaged as a \"gearless\" fighter when gears are generally proven to be useless anyway. If anything, he's being given a significant advantage in speed, an apparently natural proficiency in boxing, and somehow being able to match the power of geared opponents despite not having a gear himself and not being particularly muscular. This Joe is a far cry from the other, infinitely more engaging Yabuki Joe who had to overcome a gauntlet of mental and physical maladies to reach the height of the boxing world, and had a famously well orchestrated character arc where we observed an aimless troubled boy develop into an honest, goal-driven man with a burning passion for professional boxing. Even if Makunouchi Ippo is even to this day a pansy (at least outside of the ring), he leads an inspirational story of a bullied nerd who through sheer dedication and perseverance works his way to the top of Japan\u2019s boxing ladder. Both of these characters received at least one hundred episodes of development, whereas Joe receives only thirteen. We don\u2019t learn anything about his past. We don\u2019t learn makes him tick as a person. We don\u2019t learn his greatest fears. His character is as deep as a puddle in the Sahara desert, and it is especially in comparison to his predecessors that he pales in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not even sure how many viewers are aware of Yabuki Joe's story. I\u2019d wager less than 20% of the (Western) audience for Megalo Box have seen Ashita no Joe, let alone have finished it, which would explain all of the acclaim this anime is receiving even despite it's glaring flaws and stale as cardboard lead character who could only dream of being a successor to Yabuki Joe. I find it hard to imagine a viewer of Ashita no Joe watching this and walking away impressed, but there is at least one niche interest available to such fans in the many cross references and homages. From Sachio wearing Yabuki Joe's signature flat cap, to familiar character designs and reimagined scenes being taken directly from the original series, where Megalo Box fails to be a tribute in terms of writing and dramatic tension, it at least succeeds in paying open respect to the original series.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the above criticisms are meant to suggest that a viewer is wrong for liking Megalo Box when it does have an abundance of surface level appeal. Maybe you value tone more so than writing in media, in which case no one should be able to convince you to think otherwise. However, exceeding in one area doesn't excuse utter failure in others that are critical to the very essence of a story itself. Megalo Box is a DIRECT tribute to what I would consider to be the greatest hand to hand combat narrative in anime history. For it to have subpar fight animation and forgettable characters is a major disappointment no matter how you slice it. The only way it tries to distinguish itself from the original series is by introducing a plot device that proves itself to be totally useless, because power doesn't mean jack shit unless you can hit a moving target. Megalo Box is a decent anime for what it is - a nostalgic, short celebration of Ashita no Joe's 50th anniversary, and is not a worthy successor to the combat sport anime that came before it as is being hailed by critics universally.",

            "content": "A project commemorating the 50th anniversary of the legendary boxing manga, Ashita no Joe\u2014Megalo Box is remarkably cinematic very much cut in the mould of retro anime from vintage Madhouse and Gainax. What exactly makes this diamond in the rough shine the way it has? What has allowed it to shine in an era where it had every reason to be overlooked? It\u2019s a simple answer and its nostalgia. This is like Hajime no Ippo with Sci-Fi elements being directed by Watanabe Shinichirou and Nujabes on the beat. For a spinoff series, it's surprisingly free of the burdens of being part of a legendary franchise.Its 13 episodes long but makes every second count, it has a good pacing that builds up momentum all the way to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where underground boxing has boxers wearing gear to enhance their fighting skills, Megalo Box follows a nameless wanderer in \u201cJunk Dog,\u201d (who later becomes known as \u201cJoe,\u201d) as he is used as a tool to throw matches for cash. Determined that he has what it takes to take down the champion at this year's Megalonia, he throws his past to the side and decides to fight fearlessly to the top of the rankings. He crosses paths with people who help him on his journey as well as people who attempt to sabotage his rise. Along with some surprisingly emotional episodes involving characters from the past, this show takes your heartstrings and tugs on them pretty hard on multiple occasions. While the overall series is slightly predictable in terms of where the story progresses, the point is that it keeps you emotionally invested. Whether it\u2019s simply an episode of characters reflecting on the past or literally fighting in the ring, everyone gets his shot at a development and are fleshed out. It\u2019s almost as if the core story of fighting to the top takes a backseat and places itself on autopilot at times, as the story takes you on separate journeys into the past or future. Just when you know you have everything figured out, Megalo Box either gives you a helluva of a fight or has you begging for certain characters fates.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Joe was lost and didn\u2019t know his place in the world. He was a drifter, going along with the flow. A man from the slums who has no identity either than the moniker, \"Junk Dog\". After a confrontation with his destined rival, Yuuri, who happens to be the current Megalo Boxing champion, a burning desire was lit inside Joe to prove to everyone including himself that he can make it to the top and become champion by beating Yuuri. Both are polar opposites. Joe is brash, na\u00efve and wears his heart on his sleeve. Yuuri is cool, calm and collected. Joe is from poverty while Yuuri is wealthy. Joe starts taking control of his own destiny rather than leaving it in the hands of his manager Nanbu who had Joe throw fights in the underground circuit to earn a living. Yuuri still takes demands from his manager Yukiko who is running the Megalonia. Both characters are charismatic and ooze confidence. Nanbu eventually gives up his con past and becomes Joe\u2019s trainer and helps him get the requirements to enter ranks. Along their way they find Sachio who turns out to be a tech genius who knows about the gears, he uses his skills to help work his way into Joe\u2019s corner. Both Nanbu and Sachio have ulterior motives for joining Joe\u2019s journey and their reasons for it is very interesting. There is just a lot of chemistry and charm with the characters and there are layers to their relationships.\\n\\n\r\nTMS Entertainment name doesn\u2019t pop up much when elite anime studios are being discussed. But they\u2019re seriously making their case as far as I\u2019m concerned, not just because of quality but stylistic diversity. TMS Entertainment has never done anything quite like Megalo Box. There hasn't been much anime that try to capture an old-school mystique, and many specifically a Gainax mystique. Some even partially succeed. But Megalo Box gets a bigger piece of that pie than almost any show that I can think of. There\u2019s no credibility gap here because every aspect of this production reeks of authenticity. Ashita no Joe wasn\u2019t a Gainax series, and Megalo Box does feel faithful to it, but I just see that imprint all over it. The way it embraces the imperfections of the traditional hand-drawn art is visually nostalgic and beautiful. I\u2019m in awe of the fighting sequences that I felt I had front seats to this spectacle, the animation is superb and what highlights it, even more, is the incorporation of various camera angles, shaky cam effects, the fluidity, the choreography along with well-timed panning and transitions during the action that adds realism to the physicality and pain on display. From the backgrounds, architectures to the colour palette used make it capture the retro feel and aesthetic of a 90\u2019s classic. The visuals as a whole have a graininess that harkens back to how shows looked before the advent of HD resolutions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an anime soundtrack makes it on Spotify, you know it\u2019s a killer. Megalo Box\u2019s music is like a shoeshine combination that will knock you out and leave you in a state of pure euphoria. To put it quite simply, it\u2019s one of the greatest soundtracks to hit the airwaves in the last decade. It\u2019s Hip-Hop inspired and gives the show a lot of swagger and range. It\u2019s able to elevate the action to the next level, giving you a rush of adrenaline when fights reach its climax. Each track effortlessly compliments the various moods in and outside of the ring. The Opening gets you pumped and the Ending helps you wind down from the hype. The Voice acting is exceptional and is deserving of praise. They are able to make the voice for their character fit with their look, age, masculinity (for the fighters) and personality and make it believable\u2014especially with Joe. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of everything in Megalo Box for everyone to enjoy. It has charisma, comedy, drama, high stakes, action and other elements that point to a love of the past decade\u2014from the writing and script willing to venture into a dark and gloomy subject matter, as well as a soundtrack that is absolutely amazing with its Hip-Hop style. It all points to a love for a style of animation that the industry has since moved away from. It shows exactly what was so great about anime from the \u201cGolden Era\u201d and makes the case that even if it\u2019s gone, the likes of Megalo Box will make sure it stays far and away from being forgotten. Joe\u2019s rise from a no-name underground boxer to a world-class contender for a world championship title is a tale of the underdog, it\u2019s inspiring, you cannot help but root for his success. Despite having a few hiccups along the way, it goes the distance and after 13 rounds this Cinderella story leaves its mark.\\n",

            "content": "Warning this review contain spoilers for Megalo Box\r\nTribute is a way to celebrate old works, by taking ideas of the thing is was inspire by, try to modernize its theme, and setting. That what Megalo Box is it\u2019s a tribute to manga that was made in 1968 known as Ashita no Joe. For those who have never heard of it, Ashita no Joe was a shounen sports manga that ran in Shounen Magazine Weekly. It spanned for 20 volumes and had 171 chapters, it got an anime adaption in 1970 that ran for 79 episodes, it later got a second season during 1980 and itran for 47 episodes. For the time Ashita no Joe came it out nothing was like it, it was a heave drama show that covers all themes boxing had. It did a lot of things that establish what anime and manga known for, without a lot of your favorites wouldn\u2019t be the same. With that established, going back to the word tribute, Now if a tribute only copies things from it was inspire by does that mean new viewers who never watch Ashita no Joe won\u2019t enjoy this, no it\u2019s possible to enjoy Megalo box with seeing Joe, true you won\u2019t get the references, but you still able to get some level of enjoyment out of it. However, hear the thing about a tribute should do, a tribute needs to separate it self from the thing it\u2019s reference, sure it okay to reference things you are inspire from, but you need to separate yourself from it the inspiration. That what you are looking into with this review and determine if Megalo Box did enough to consider separate series or is still in Ashita no Joe shell? \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show revolves Junk Dog wanted to see how strong he truly he is, he never been sure, due to the fact he been fighting fix boxing matches, in order to get money, as they are involved with this mafia boss they own a lot of money too. It isn\u2019t until he meets Yuri and Yuri gets curious how strong is Junk Dog, they fight, and Yuri is impressed that he was able to make him use both his hands against him. After Junk Dog lost the match again Yuri, he vows to challenge Yuri once again and show him how strong he can become. He changes his name to Joe to as a reference to Joe Yabuki the main character of Ashita no Joe.  With this you think that their a rivalry going between Joe and Yuri, but that were you wrong, as you loo into the content of their characters, Junk Dog the only one who cares about facing Yuri. Yuri during majority of the shows doesn\u2019t care if he never faces him again, true the strong Joe become the more interest Yuri is, but it isn\u2019t until the days before they have their final match Yuri is interested in facing him. With that we have to give Joe opponents for him to face to reach the right to face Yuri again. With that this show mainly becomes boxing matches of the week, as we keep moving on to the next guy, which hurt the show as this show doesn\u2019t have proper build up to it matches and does spend enough time developing its characters. If was 26 instead of 13 we could have more time between matches, more growth for Joe and Yuri, and the matches could be more intense. That the problem her with it\u2019s matches, sure they are great to look it, but you release majority of the fights fell dull, because they have to hurry up and finish the fight, that way we have time to do JD vs Yuri. Even when we get to the match,  the fight is lackluster, majority of it is finally fight it just Joe taking hits and trying to survive, it isn\u2019t until the last round, he start to fight back and beat Yuri with a Cross Counter, which that a giving as in Ashita no Joe, Joe signature move is the cross counter, so that was bound to be use in Megalo Box somepoint in the series. However even it cool too see as I do love that move, it\u2019s comes off a lame, as if the fight had more episodes to it, the impact of cross counter, cloud have been epic, it could have been awesome, but its\u2019 not. What we are left it an empty final fight, which a shame I wanted the fight to be epic, as Joe Vs Rikishi was, but we didn\u2019t get that. Instead we got a lame fight. Now if you are think even if the fights were rushed and they were at least well animated, and you right they are. The show has a never nice looking retro style that different then what we are used to coming out. We get shows that look not much different from each other, so for a show like Megalo Box to come out in the time it did, felt refreshing, and that what made the popular when it was out. \\n\\n\r\nNow beside the story and animation, what I want to look into before discussion my thoughts on the ending are its characters, and its character with the expect of Nanbo are one note. They stick to what they are establish of begin. Joe is stereotypical badass main character, who try to challenge the use of gears, by going in matches without one, giving him the nick name gearless Joe. Which is a cool name, I got to admit, but I wish he would grow more beside how far he gets rankings. Their nothing much to his character, he doesn\u2019t develop enough, if the show 26 we could have done more to develop him. But with it being 13 episodes we get not much time to develop, as we got to make sure Joe can face Yuri by episode 13. Speaking of Yuri like Joe his character stays the same, he the top guy that no can defeat, he has to the best gear, he has the best promotion, he powerful, he got it all. It isn\u2019t until episode 12 we see something about that change, he decides to let go all things he been giving to him, his gear, his team, he going to face Joe as a one-man team, to show a form of respect to him. I like this, but I wish we got something more. The other characters such as Yukiko, Sachio, Fujimaki and the guys Joe fact, are one note as well, they don\u2019t have anything special to them. Now you nothing I exclude Nanbu right, well the thing about Nanbu he actually gets development. He starts own as your typical teacher, but we get more to his character, we see a guy to go far for to make sure Joe is successful and try to settle the score he has with Fujimaki. Which I like this, and to see how it all end him with losing an eye, was a nice brutal scene, that I was surprise to see get pull of so well. Not jut that, but when Joe was facing his former student, we get a side of Nanbu we didn\u2019t see before. We get a man with a lot of regrets, and he wish the man he trains end better than what he ended up as. I like this it gives him something more than the character he was based off being Danpei. Nanbu is able to separate from the character he was inspired by. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the shows was a disappointment, true it was nice to see Joe win, but I would like Joe and Yuri died in the end. It would have offer a nice tragic conclusion to see these two men fight to the death. But in the end what we got with Joe retiring and Yuri being crippled, which that is rough that man career is over. But it would have been epic to see both of them die with that cross counter, and end of being a draw. With that said there isn\u2019t too much to left say about Megalo Box, it\u2019s a show that stick to the thing that was inspire about by. Which is not good, as a person who know on here as the biggest Ashita no Joe on here, I wanted Megalo Box to separate itself, and I could judge as its own thing, and look back on and say that was the best tribute every made. But we didn\u2019t get that we got a series that stick what it started as and remind the same. Which is a shame, it could have been more, but because of the it being 13 episodes, what we got was anime that always be in Ashita no shell. With that being said I give Megalo Box a 6.5 out of 10. \\n",

            "content": "So...Megalo Box. I have a lot of reservations for it because I really liked the first few episodes but in the end its just disappointing.\r\nI still feel like the entire setting was created just for Megalo Box and the universe outside of it just does not exist and then what Megalovania ends up being has nothing to do with that and...they created everything for something that ended up not mattering.I dont really know what they were going for or what any supposed thematic elements could even be. Class metaphor? Not really. Natural talent vs hard work? Not sure. The pureness of a sport taken awayfrom the roots by companies? The Shirato people are not even a factor to the overall plot of anything. Those things are there but barely, so inconsequential that they feel like accidents and not thesis statements This entire show -the entire idea of the name of the show - exists for Joe and Yuri and they have no passion between them. A good rivalry needs some animus, some driving factor, some similarities, any emotion at all. I don't get that from either of them. I'm still unsure what their actual goals are. Why are they striving so hard for this? What even set Joe off about Yuri in the first place? Do they just want a Goku/Vegeta good-ass fight? Do they want to stare death in the face for the thrill of it? I don't think even the show knows. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending doesn't really settle as anything satisfying for me. I'm not even sure the characters got what they wanted based on what I thought. I feel like the conclusion they reached for the final fight was the right one, but it didn't come about naturally. They skipped too many steps. Megalo Boxing and the Gears never mattered. The idea of boxing but more dangerous didn't matter because Joe could just take any hit.\\n\\n\r\nI still don't know what they were going for with this series. In a season with so many disappointments, this one still manages to stand out as it wasn't like this immediately out the gate, but instead just quickly ran out of energy.",

            "content": "TLDR: \r\nMegalo Box is an incredible watch which sets the stage for you to want to kill for the next episode. It is the epitome of an original action-packed thriller boxing anime and will not disappoint in any major way. If you have the time of your life to lose, Megalo box should be the thief that takes your damned free time.\r\nScores~ Story [8] Art [7] Sound [9] Character [9] Enjoyment [10] Overall [8.6]\r\nStory [8]:\r\nMegalo introduces a new approach to the boxing genre as it incorporates an entirely new mechanic into the physical sport. This mechanic allows the series to pan out quite interestingly asthey find means to overcome entirely different obstacles to win. \\n\r\nAlthough the story doesn't typically allow a typical \"introduction\" to the landscape, we are able to imply various situations with relative ease. This combined with its immersive \"junk rat\" feel Megalo culminates as a completely different and refreshing take on the boxing environment as it drags you into its violent and volatile world.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]\\n\r\nAs this is a remake, it can be understood that the art will look rather dated and this is true here. The art style itself is of a lower resolution than the typical 2018 animes we've seen, but it works out completely in its favour here as it presents an entirely new concept. Due to the setting of the anime, the use of the older art only adds to the scrapyard feel and compliments the plot and setting produced by the studio. Combine with its consistency throughout fight scenes and solid application to characters, we are left with art as its weakest point but in no way, a hindrance. \\n\\n\r\nSound [9]\\n\r\nThe sound is incredible. \\n\r\nIt's perfect timing in the fight scenes. The immersive tracks throughout the series. The appropriately themed OP and ending tracks. It brings the whole work together as a high-quality body of work. Even though the MC can sound like a bore, the studio approaches to every line with proper intentions in mind and add on top of the already immersive tone on the series. TMS Entertainment has done an incredibly good job here making the whole thing work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]\\n\r\nMegalo Box's characters are enticing and interesting. The studio has allowed each character to carve out their own role within the series, no matter how minor it might be. Served with their own interesting and deep personalities, Megalo Box is a prime example of character and character development done right, as it proceeds to allow the characters free reign upon the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\r\nOh my. \\n\r\nAn action-packed, thrilling fighting anime that includes an incredibly interesting MC that strays from the \"I'm weak help me\" archetype basically describes what I'm seeing. I love it, to every part. The immersion that the studio has allowed Megalo to project. The consideration of every single character displayed within the series. The studio has respected this remake, reimagined it and added a little extra. This is one of the most enjoyable and memorable watches I have ever lied my eyes on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall [8.6]\\n\r\nMegalo Box is the prime example of a boxing anime done right and doesn't seem to falter in any major aspect. The studio has respected the identity and world within the series and amplified its effect as they noticeably put every ounce of their being into this anime. \\n\r\nIf you haven't touched this anime, I recommend you do so and come with rather high expectations because after its all said and done,\\n\\n\r\nIt has and will deliver. \\n\\n\r\nSo go to where you watch anime and watch it now. It has and will be an experience to remember.\\n",

            "content": "Megalo Box started off as a really cool anime. The most noticeable thing to anyone at first glance is the art, which if I remember correctly was just the art being down-scaled and then up-scaled to give it the aesthetic it has. Don't quote me on that. Either way, the artstyle was interesting and the idea of a 50th anniversary project for Ashita no Joe sounded interesting. So why did it end up like it did? There'll be spoilers, btw.\r\nThe first few episodes were great, personally. The soundtrack alongside the art made the first few episodes seem badass and hype, and I was really rootingfor Joe to win his goal of...not losing matches I guess? I mean, the main \"story\" doesn't start until a few episodes in, but even by then you're already given several good setups at least.\\n\\n\r\n-The protagonist, Joe, who is an underdog type character without too much unique to his personality. He's cool and all at least, enough to get you rooting for him if nothing else. Plus he rides a motorcycle 3 or 4 times.\\n\r\n- An antagonist, Yuri, who doesn't actually seem like a generic douchebag but an actual person who respects the sport and the fighters, and is rather likable as far as antagonists go, even by the end.\\n\r\n-An idea of what exactly Megalo-boxing is and on what scale of appeal the sport is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's enough of a setup within the first few episodes to give a sports anime a nice start, a promising start. I sure thought so, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was pretty good up until the main story started, whatever episode that was. I don't think I'm in the minority opinion for that statement seeing as how the MAL score around that time started slowly going down from a mid-8.4 to what it is now. The problem that starts around this time is the problem that the show inevitably ends with: predictability.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a sports anime, you're kind of expected from the get-go to assume the protagonist will win a lot of the time and be all badass and stuff. But Megalo Box doesn't even try to be subtle about it. Every match is the same thing over and over again. You're given an \"antagonist\" for that match who gets some semi-interesting backstory and maybe some relevancy to other characters, and then they get in the ring with Joe and they both have at each other. Joe gets the absolute crap beat out of him for several minutes, while Sachiko (an annoying and 100% useless kid who does a really cringey rap in one of the last few episodes) and Nanbu (a generic coach) yell at him to do this and that and not give up. Then, through the power of absolutely nothing, Joe is able to K.O. the opponent in one hit, ending the match with a win for him. I never mentioned this, but Joe is \"gearless\" during all of these fights meaning that basically he doesn't have these boxing-aid-machines on his arms. Logically, he should lose all his battles against his opponents who DO all have gear, since they literally have machines on their arms whereas Joe has his arms bare, however, he never loses. This means that Joe is literally the most overpowered character in this show, because not once does he get KO'd even though by all means he should, especially when you see how badly his ass gets beat in the ring. Each match starts and ends the same way, with a lot of flashbacks and other things going on being thrown into the fray WHILE the matches are going on, which often times messes with the momentum of the fights. Most of that stuff could've been mentioned before the fights at least, then I'd at least go into each fight with a good understanding of the opponent, regardless of how generic their backstory is.\\n\r\nThat doesn't happen, of course. The fights are pretty cool though, and well choreographed imo.\\n\\n\r\nAsides from the matches being done in such a bad way (asides from the actual fighting, for the most part), the main story is also really lame. A woman, who also could be considered an antagonist of sorts, is basically the founder of megalo-boxing as we see it and hosts the competition for which everything takes place. I think what her goal was was to show-off how interesting megalo-boxing was and how viable it is as a military weapon. At least, that's what I could remember from the ending. Frankly, whenever the fights weren't happening I found myself bored a lot of the time, which is another point to bring up. Sure the music's good and the art is unique, but the characters either have no depth or are straight-up bad. Why should I care about the story anyways? I already know Joe is going to win all the matches just because he can, why not just skip to the fights? I mean, they show the meat of who the opponents Joe face are mid-fighting, so it's not like I have to spend the other 15 minutes getting to know who they are and whatever the hell else is going on. The only character I can say was genuinely interesting was Yuri, although he reminds me too much of the one character from Ping Pong to say he's original. On the other hand, there's some story going on with Nanbu and some loanshark type guy who's just an asshole but is also kind of cool. Nanbu has to have Joe win the Megalo Box tournament at first so that the mean man can make money, then he has to lose it so the mean man can make money. It's probably the most interesting thing going on story-wise but that isn't saying a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nSo all-in-all, you've got a run-of-the-mill nothing story, several obnoxious/shallow/boring characters, and fights that are as predictable as they come. Frankly, I can't say there's much reason to watch this show asides from the artstyle and soundtrack. If you strip those two things away this show has nothing else going for it really. That's not to say you SHOULDN'T watch it, that's your choice obviously and there's some pretty cool stuff that happens in the show every so often, but there's nothing to gain from watching it. No messages besides generic underdog stuff and blah blah blah watch Rocky instead if you want something more interesting that's also boxing related (can't comment on Ippo or Ashita no Joe, so). Frankly this show is just disappointing and has nothing worthwhile in any of the major departments. Can't really recommend it for anyone who wants a sports anime with substance as I can with, say, Ping Pong. Give that a watch instead, there's a good chance it'll be more of an experience than this show would be.\\n",

Reel Steel meets Hajime No Ippo!\r\nMegalo isn't mega-awesome in any facet of the game, but it does provide enough entertainment for me to consider it a good show.  Our protagonist is similar to any deadbeat, wannabe protagonist in the history of anime except for the fact that he has cool scars and rides a motorcycle to get his mind off of spicy tentacle porn.  \r\n\"Joe\" is tired of being a boxer who has real potential, yet continues to throw it all away by partaking in fixed fights within the undergroundboxing circuit.  But hey, it's the only thing he can do for actual money, right?\\n\\n\r\nWrong! Megalonia comes along and that changes everything.  It's a special tournament for ultra rich boxers who have access to enhanced gear, which technically would help a boxer kill a person instantaneously upon impact, but not Joe! He's immune to punches, injuries and surgeries.  And thus our story begins, Joe goes on a journey with: a shady boxing manager, an orphan kid who has sickle cell anemia, and a champion who is into beastiality with huskies (two truths and one lie).  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts off fresh and intriguing but quickly loses steam and turns into your predictable, everyday fighting anime.  By the end of it all, I'm asking myself why the hell did Megalonia sanction a quadriplegic war vet with massive PTSD to fight in a boxing ring where men beat each other with gigantic robot arms? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's good but it's definitely not great.  The moral of the story is...  don't trust scorpions! FUCK FROGS!! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a bilingual review about my experience with Megalobox, I haven't seen Ashita no Joe which is what this series is giving tribute to, but that's not the real point of my review, this is probably the best candidate to anime of the year that I ever seen so far and you are gonna see why.\r\nLa rese\u00f1a est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, ve un poco m\u00e1s abajo para leerla.\r\nEnglish:\r\nMegalobox is one of those animes that are not seen very often in the modern anime, we can not always see a protagonist with an underdog style who has to beat people in street fights to survive throughpoverty, the style of the series is something that I love and really don't understand why many people complain about the quality of the animation, this gives a pretty cool retro style, and not only there are people complaining about this, but several  people see the wrong side of the premise and they think that Gears are something unnecessary and I will tell you why all these points are wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI was also confused at the beginning, what is the point of using a mechanism that increases your strength? Why don't they do normal boxing? This is something that in the first 3 episodes of the series clarify quite noticeably, when Joe is watching television in the first scene, the series itself questions the existence of Gear technology, which they respond that it is a good for the society and that is a way to maintain a balance, also, later they say that Megalobox does not discriminate and anyone can enter the tournament regardless of their age or physical condition.\\n\r\nAnd it's here when the series shows us that none of these facts are like that, when Joe tells Yuuri (in the first episode) \"show me your real Megalobox\" it's because boxing is not just marketing, it's about feeling adrenaline and try to outdo yourself and feel the glory of winning, and these are values \u200b\u200bthat in the society of the series have been lost, the existence of the gears is not only to make the fights interesting, it is a reflection that boxing it's not always about doing something you like, it's a business, a way to over-exploit people's pockets by encouraging them to enter a tournament in which if you're not a millionaire who can buy a powerful Gear, you can never win.\\n\r\nAnd this is not something that simply happens in the series, a fairly easy example of this are video games and micro transactions, you can not enjoy something you like without investing some money to gain an advantage within it (of course, in this case there are exceptions), the same happens with the world of music, not only you must invest in instruments, you must invest in advertising and a manager to make yourself known and even so, you may still fail, be betrayed and all your money will end up wasted.\\n\r\nJoe is aware of all this and wants to show the world that sports is something that we are all capable of enjoying and that social inequality should not be something that keeps us from doing what we like the most.\\n\r\nMany people do not realize the message of the series, because generally one is focused on the protagonist and the dialogues instead of looking at the surroundings, and the series doesn't directly say you all of this, you have to figure it out through all the clues in the scenarios, and little details that tells you the meaning of this anime. This is not a problem of the direction, because it's a fantastic way to show the premise without wasting time with dialogues as a way to explain the plot of the series but I have to say, being a 12 episode series about boxing is a really bad combination which proves why Hashime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe are better than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters, starting with Joe, the protagonist, as I mentioned before, he's the type of person who trusts his ideals and has an instinct of justice for helping others, even though his thoughts go hand in hand with the philosophy of the series, he has no credible reason why he feels passion for boxing, at first we see that he only fights to survive and gain his paycheck, later we see what motivates him to enter the Megalobox tournament, but we never know why he likes boxing in the first place and we don't know about his past either, so the spectator usually does not identify much with the character beyond his goals. Throughout the series he really improves his way of fighting and has a great development of his way of thinking and personality but usually he makes the same mistakes sometimes despite the fact that Nanbu and Sachio remind him of those mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNanbu Gansaku on the other hand has a consistent character development, at first we see him as a bastard who only wants to make money without caring about others, however during the series we see how his connection with Joe becomes stronger when they both try to reach to the top, and also the series shows us his reasons why he initially has this behavior with Joe through his past, so certainly, this is the best character in the whole series despite of him being a plot device in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSachio is a boy who is introduced in the third episode, his role is similar to  Nanbu's which is to support Joe and help him train, he also has a great passion for the Megalobox and his motivations, although they are not too deep, they are understandable enough to ignore his very empty introduction. Beyond this, it is a simple character that serves to show a couple of references to Ashita no Joe and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is the main antagonist of the series, I would say that he is in the same situation as Joe, we don't know his past nor his real motives for being the champion of Megalobox, however his personality reflects several themes that the series touches. In addition to those already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Yuuri experiments the emptiness of always winning and understanding more what boxing truly means, this is indeed a good development of his personality, mainly because of meeting Joe in the first episode. I don't have much more to add about him.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go into my favorite territory of the series which is the soundtrack, saying that it's great it's not enough, the hip hop songs combining it with the scenes showing the city and the well detailed streets is such a great combination to help the viewer immerse itself into the urban atmosphere. And the hard rock of the opening is something wonderful showing how MANLY the series is, the ending and its lyrics reflect very well the emotions of the characters besides that it has a pretty catchy rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation along with the direction is very beautiful and the retro style that this has combined with the handmade animation makes it very attractive and enjoyable to look at, often the show has small quality downgrades but fortunately this doesn't happen in the fight scenes so that's tolerable, the shots of the scenarios are very detailed and quite realistic, there is not much more to say, just great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm very sorry if there's grammar errors, english is not my native language I would highly appreciate suggestions and criticism to help me improve, thank you so much for reading ;)\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol:\\n\r\nMegalobox es de esos animes que ya no se ven muy a menudo en el anime moderno, no siempre podemos ver a un protagonista con un estilo de lobo solitario que tiene que darse de golpizas en peleas callejeras para sobrevivir en la pobreza, su estilo es algo que me encanta y realmente no entiendo por qu\u00e9 mucha gente se queja de la calidad de animaci\u00f3n, siendo \u00e9sta algo que le da ese toque retro y genial a la serie, y no solo hay gente quej\u00e1ndose de \u00e9sto, sino que varios ven la premisa de utilizar gears como algo innecesario y les dir\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 todos estos puntos son err\u00f3neos.\\n\\n\r\nPara empezar, la trama es algo que a mi tambi\u00e9n me tuvo confuso al principio, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el punto de utilizar un mecanismo que incrementa tu fuerza? \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no hacen boxeo normal? Esto es algo que los primeros 3 episodios de la serie aclaran de forma bastante notoria, cuando Joe est\u00e1 viendo la televisi\u00f3n en la primera escena, la serie misma se cuestiona la existencia de la tecnolog\u00eda Gear, a la cu\u00e1l responden que es un bien para la sociedad y que es una manera de mantener un equilibrio, tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s adelante dicen que Megalobox no discrimina y cualquiera puede entrar en el torneo sin importar su edad o condici\u00f3n f\u00edsica.\\n\r\nY es ac\u00e1 cuando la serie nos muestra que ninguno de \u00e9stos hechos son as\u00ed, cuando Joe le dice a Yuri (en el primer episodio) \"mu\u00e9strame tu verdadero Megalobox\" es debido a que el boxeo no es simplemente marketing, se trata de sentir adrenalina, intentar superarte a ti mismo y sentir la gloria de ganar, y estos son valores que en la sociedad de la serie se han perdido, la existencia de los gears no solo es para hacer las peleas interesantes, es un reflejo de que el deporte no siempre se trata de hacer algo que te guste, es un negocio, una forma para sobre explotar el bolsillo de la gente incit\u00e1ndolos a entrar en un torneo en el que si no eres un millonario que pueda comprarse un Gear potente, nunca podr\u00e1s ganar.\\n\r\nY esto no es algo que simplemente ocurre en la serie, un ejemplo bastante f\u00e1cil de esto son los videojuegos y las micro transacciones, no puedes disfrutar de algo que te guste sin invertir algo de dinero para ganar una ventaja dentro de \u00e9ste (obviamente existen excepciones para este caso); lo mismo pasa con el mundo de la m\u00fasica, no s\u00f3lo se debe invertir en instrumentos, debes invertir en publicidad y manager para hacerte conocer e incluso as\u00ed, es posible que seas traicionado y fracases rotundamente. \\n\r\nJoe es consciente de todo esto y quiere demostrarle al mundo que el deporte es algo que todos somos capaces de disfrutar y que la desigualdad social no debe ser algo que nos retenga de hacer lo que m\u00e1s nos guste.\\n\r\nMucha gente no se da cuenta del mensaje de la serie, debido a que generalmente uno est\u00e1 enfocado en el protagonista y los di\u00e1logos en vez de mirar a los alrededores y la serie no te dice todo esto directamente, debes averiguarlo a trav\u00e9s de todas las pistas en los escenarios, y peque\u00f1os detalles que te dicen el significado de este anime. Esto no es un problema de la direcci\u00f3n, ya que veo como una forma fant\u00e1stica de mostrar la premisa sin perder el tiempo con di\u00e1logos como una forma de exposici\u00f3n para explicar la trama de la serie, pero tengo que decir que ser una serie de 12 episodios sobre el boxeo es una combinaci\u00f3n realmente mala y es por eso que Hajime no Ippo y Ashita no Joe son mejores que esto.\\n\\n\r\nAhora hablemos de los personajes, empezando por Joe, el protagonista, como he mencionado antes, es un tipo de persona que cree mucho en sus ideales y posee un instinto de justicia por ayudar a los dem\u00e1s, sin embargo a pesar de que sus pensamientos vayan de la mano con la filosof\u00eda de la serie, no posee un motivo cre\u00edble por el cual \u00e9ste siente pasi\u00f3n por el boxeo, al principio lo vemos que s\u00f3lo pelea para ganarse el pan y sobrevivir en la pobreza, y luego vemos lo que lo motiva a querer entrar al Megalobox, pero nunca sabemos por qu\u00e9 le gusta el boxeo en primer lugar y tampoco conocemos su pasado, por lo que el espectador por lo general no suele identificarse mucho con el personaje m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus objetivos, posee un buen desarrollo siendo alguien que solo le gusta pelear, mejorando su estilo de pelea y aprendiendo de sus oponentes, aunque suele cometer los mismos errores repetidas veces a pesar de que Nanbu y Sachio se lo recuerden.\\n\\n\r\nNanbu Gansaku por otro lado s\u00ed tiene un desarrollo consistente de personaje, al principio lo vemos como un bastardo que solo quiere hacer dinero sin importarle los dem\u00e1s, sin embargo durante la serie vemos como su conexi\u00f3n con Joe cada vez se hace mas fuerte cuando ambos intentan llegar a la cima, y tambi\u00e9n la serie nos muestra sus motivos por el cual \u00e9ste al principio tiene \u00e9ste comportamiento inicial a trav\u00e9s de su pasado, por lo que ciertamente, este es el mejor personaje de toda la serie que no es un simple plot device, si bien es alguien que contribuye a que la trama avance para que Joe consiga entrar al Megalobox, es un personaje bastante completo.\\n\\n\r\nSachio es un ni\u00f1o que es introducido en el tercer episodio, su funci\u00f3n es similar a la de Nanbu la cual es brindarle apoyo a Joe y ayudarlo a entrenar, tambi\u00e9n posee una gran pasi\u00f3n por el Megalobox y sus motivaciones aunque no son profundizadas demasiado, son lo suficientemente entendibles como para que pase por alto su muy vac\u00eda introducci\u00f3n. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esto, es un simple personaje que sirve para mostrar un par de referencias a Ashita no Joe y nada m\u00e1s.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri, el cu\u00e1l es el antagonista principal de la serie, dir\u00eda que est\u00e1 en la misma situaci\u00f3n que Joe, no conocemos su pasado ni tampoco sus motivos reales por el que \u00e9ste sea el campe\u00f3n de Megalobox, sin embargo su personalidad refleja varios temas que toca la serie adem\u00e1s de los ya mencionados al principio de la rese\u00f1a, como el vac\u00edo de ganar siempre y entender m\u00e1s lo que es realmente el boxeo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de un simple deporte que genera ganancias, \u00e9sto es considerado m\u00e1s un desarrollo de personaje ya que es Joe quien lo hace cuestionarse todo esto. No tengo mucho m\u00e1s que a\u00f1adir de \u00e9l.\\n\\n\r\nAhora entremos el mi territorio favorito de la serie el cual es el soundtrack, decir que es genial es quedarse corto, la combinaci\u00f3n de hip hop con las escenas mostrando la ciudad y su pobreza van como anillo al dedo. Y el hard rock del opening es algo maravilloso mostrando lo MANLY que es la serie, el ending y su letra refleja muy bien las emociones de los personajes adem\u00e1s de que posee un ritmo bastante pegadizo.\\n\\n\r\nLa animaci\u00f3n junto con la direcci\u00f3n es muy hermosa y el estilo retro que \u00e9sta posee sumado a la animaci\u00f3n hecha a mano la hace muy atractiva y disfrutable a la vista, suele tener peque\u00f1os bajones de calidad pero por suerte \u00e9sto no sucede en las peleas por lo que es tolerable, los planos de los escenarios por estar hecho a mano son muy detallados y bastante realistas, no hay mucho m\u00e1s que decir, simplemente genial. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 7/10\\n\r\nArte: 9/10\\n\r\nSonido: 9/10\\n\r\nPersonajes: 6/10\\n\r\nDisfrute: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNota final: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCualquier sugerencia o critica mientras sea bien fundamentada es bienvenida, muchas gracias por haber le\u00eddo mi segunda rese\u00f1a ;)",

            "content": "*Minimum Spoiler Hidden Gem Review*\r\nTL;DR: If a young Hajime no Ippo made an illegitimate baby with the sexy cougar, Cowboy Bebop, in an 80's themed love hotel with Samurai Champloo music blasting in the background, then Megalo Box would be the gorgeous mixed bastard child that will emerge from the Redline ambulance nine months later. Such a hidden gem but packs so much hype. \"JOEEEEE!\"\r\n[Story: 6/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]\r\n\"They don't make tombstones for stray dogs\" - JD\r\nYes Yes Yes. This is that shounen sports anime this season badly needed to remind what real anime is all about. You don'tneed bad CG. You don't need blended CG. You don't need Ufotable level CG. What you need is a good mindblasting underdog story, eyegasmic hand-drawn visuals and eargasmic catchy rap music to ignite that flame that you put out long time ago to suffer through random sports anime thrown at you. Boxing anime can always be hyped. There is just something about two people beating the crap out of each other that brings out our animalistic nature to get that testosterone cascading within us and our blood viciously pumping through our veins. Megalo Box just takes it one step further. If you didn't watch it yet, then damn you are one lucky twat, because you get to binge this greatness and I'll tell you why.  \\n\\n\r\n\"I don't mind dying as long as I know that the faith I had in myself was real\" - Joe\\n\\n\r\nThis is an underdog story paying an homage to the 50 years of greatness to the boxing anime, Ashita no Joe, brought in the Japanese Anime Industry. It's a similar story however with one twist, mechanical box or gear attached to every boxer that enhances the speed and power of the user. Boxing is already bloody as it is, now imagine boxing with robotic limbs. \\n\r\nIt's a crazy concept but luckily this is not the focal point of the story and we don't focus on the gear too much but rather the boxer themselves. This anime follows the archetypal hero's journey but since they execute it well, it becomes a great strength rather than an overused flaw. The whole idea is that there is a Megalo Box World Tourney and our hero must fight from the slums where he threw boxing matches to earn money to face the number one boxer, Yuuri, in the new Megalo Box Arena. Will he be able to do it? Find out on the next episode of DBZ. Jokes aside, from training montages to flashbacks of boxers' background to understanding their purpose in life, you really get drawn to this linear rollercoaster plot that's constantly giving you knee-jerks to throw you off of it. However, if you hang on tight, albeit a few slip-ups here and there, you get to taste the rewarding experience.  \\n\\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell me your name?\" - Yuuri\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about Megalo Box are the characters. There aren't many but the few characters that are shown are really well fleshed out. They don't have as much complexity as other boxing anime have but given the limited number of episodes they have to work with, we get to understand their emotional baggage they carry with them. We have \"Joe,\" a junkyard dog coming from the slums that are cast aside in the society, Nanbu, his shady coach, Sacchio, a tech-genius kid  seeking revenge against the rich and lastly Yuuri, a Russian husky of a boxer, champion of the Megalo Box arena, itching to find the greatest opponent in his life to give a good beatdown. All of these masochistic characters have so much  charisma that they easily outshine the lackluster one-dimensional side characters thrown in this anime. Moreover, with a great deep-voiced seiyuu cast, this show feels so gritty and lifelike. Every time, Joe or Yuuri, speaks, they just steal the scene. Kudos to the seiyuus for not holding this anime back. \\n\\n\r\n\"If his punches were sharp, they wouldn't sound like a cow cutting through cheese\" - Coach Nanbu\\n\\n\r\nAside from the linear rollercoaster story and the gritty characters, the highlight of this anime are the animation and music. Seriously from episode one, the hand drawn animation puts so much life into this anime. Each panel feels picturesque. Each panel feels like it can be a wallpaper. The characters are so well drawn while maintaing the respect for Ashita no Joe and the use of lines & variation of pen-strokes just makes this anime stand out from other boxing anime that came out before them. It really goes to show how maintaining a good homogenous colour palette throughout the animation really pays off. The fight sequences are well drawn and choregraphed as well. Aside from the breathtaking visuals, the music is really freaking good. The OP song provides the hype and the ED song mellows us out but the background score and sound bits in the transitions are just addictive to listen to. This anime will have one of the best standalone OST to listen to. Couple that with gritty rap music thrown in at appropriate times in the anime, it catapults the plot and hype even further. If you don't get to watch the anime, atleast listen to the OST.\\n\\n\r\n\"Everyone's only looking out for number one, \\n\r\nso why stop now? You're still not done. \\n\r\nNo metal on your back so they call you gearless, \\n\r\nright now the way you act sure ain't fearless\" - Sacchio\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Megalo Box is a great sports shounen anime to watch if you are into boxing. Their purpose was to celebrate the 50 years of Ashita no Joe and they went ahead did just that and more. They brought back boxing anime to its roots and they showed us hand-drawn animation will never be beaten by commercialized CG animation industry. If you put forth passion and work hard to achieve a goal, then it will all be worthwhile in the end. This anime isn't perfect and everyone always enjoys sports anime of the sport they are into, but even if you aren't into boxing, it's enjoyable to watch as they don't delve that much in detail about how to box. So if you can get past the crazy plot of boxers using mechanical gears & one dimensional side characters, give this show a watch. After all, this anime isn't about the destination, it's about the journey and being the spectators we are in that megalo box arena, let's just sit back and enjoy. Anyways, check it out & let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite quote from the anime! Ciao.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",

            "content": "Art, in its purest form, is a catharsis of imperceptible cognitive entities onto a \u201ccanvas\u201d for the purposes of provoking reactions from others.  Sometimes that reaction involves laughter, other times it is sorrow, and on rare occasions, profound enlightenment, in either case, it is the responsibility of the artist(s) to determine the desired reaction, and how best to achieve it through their intended medium.  As one would expect, it permits a copious amount of creativity to take place, yielding unexpected outcomes that one would rarely see in the real world.  Antithetical to this branch of human intrigue, is the world of binaryresults and conventional outcomes, otherwise known as: sports.  That is not to say that all sporting events are replicas of past events, but in the grand scheme, one team will lose, and one team will win \u2014 end of story.  As is the case with a boxing match, one boxer will lose, and the other, by default, will win (I understand there can be split decisions, but for the sake of argument, bare with me).  In case I am mistaken, one cannot win at art, as it has no predetermined result.  \\n\\n\r\nErgo, making the mixture of the two (art and sport) quite the peculiar one.\\n\\n\r\nOne demands openness and originality, while the other requires an outcome.  Not to say that it cannot be done, as the predecessor of this series, \u201cAshita no Joe\u201d proved otherwise.  Yet, fans of the original series will be quick to point out, that while it was a \u201cboxing anime,\u201d it was so much more.  In a numerous amount of ways, the original \u201cJoe\u201d is akin to Ping Pong The Animation \u2014 a character driven narrative \u2014 as opposed to your typical sports anime.  Breaking free from the restrictions of defined outcomes and crafting something truly imaginative.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, how does this new iteration of \u201cJoe\" stack up on the hierarchy of sports anime?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to discuss the story first, mainly because I feel there is one glaring detail that demands acknowledgement before pressing forward.  I am referring to the \u201cGear\u201d (i.e. mechanical limbs) the boxers use to inflict blood-stained carnage on their respective opponents.  The concept, in theory, sounds interesting, but when one considers the ramifications, especially with the proliferation of CTE in athletes, it\u2019s a horrifying notion.  Imagine if \u201cIron\u201d Mike Tyson were equipped with this \"Gear\" in his prime, he would straight up murder people with one punch (cue the One Punch Man theme music).  In all seriousness, weaponizing the instrument of pain with highly sophisticated machinery, without providing protective barriers for the combatants is just ludicrous and a colossal oversight on the writer\u2019s part. I understand the rationale behind the decision, as it pertains to my original statement regarding originality, or lack thereof, in sports.  But, this innovative nuance is just a cosmetic flourish that adds little to nothing towards the overall plot.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nBecause there are numerous routes the anime staff could have taken this idea, that would have elevated this anime into something worth remembering.  Perhaps, for example, they could have used the technology to profit from unnecessary conflicts and war, propagating political tensions and the fears of an overreaching quasi-government (this was sort of hinted at, but never really explored with any specific detail).  Boxing would have still been the main focus, but underneath, you would have an interesting perspective about the dangers of proliferating technology.  Instead, what we are left with, is a brother and sister competing for control over their father\u2019s legacy.  Then, much to the chagrin of the viewer, Yuuri decides to expel his integrated \u201cgear\u201d for the final match, making the entire concept an irrelevant element in a story that \u2014 desperately \u2014 needed vitality to successfully engage the viewer.  As the saying goes: haste makes waste.  The \u201cgear\u201d was the waste; therefore, invariably, the production must have been made in haste. \\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the story is your ordinary sports anime framework, by which I mean: a tournament.  Somewhat unavoidable, given the format of the show, but do we really need to see Joe get knocked down for a ten count, only to rise to his feet at the count of nine, in every single fight?  Watch boxing clips on YouTube and you will see for yourself that this sort of thing rarely happens.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nJoe, as they refer to him in the series, is reminiscent of a stray dog: he\u2019s tough, gritty, aggressive, and has nothing to lose.  Another characteristic of stray dogs is fear, an emotion that is briefly touched upon in Joe\u2019s first fight (his first fight in the tournament, that is), but is never revisited later in the series.  I would have liked to see this affliction be a recurring issue for Joe, a malignant hindrance that would have required significant mental effort to overcome his anxieties, potentially derailing his short-term goal of reaching Megalonia.  Unfortunately, the series allows Joe to conquer this obstacle relatively early, diminishing much of the intrigue in his plight towards the top.  In this sense, the story quickly dissolves from being an in depth character drama, and into a simple revenge story.  The reflection of emulating the original \u201cJoe\u201d proved too arduous for \u201cMegalo-Joe\u201d to achieve, disappointing fans of the original series who were looking for a show that retained its predecessor\u2019s desirable traits.\\n\\n\r\nGansaku Nanbu, Joe\u2019s manager, is your prototypical boxing coach: tough exterior, but has a sense of honor and virtue.  His actions are fairly predictable, and while they attempt to portray him as an indifferent character, we all know he will stand in Joe\u2019s corner, no matter the circumstances; thus, nullifying the astonishment of his evident, false heel turn(s).\\n\\n\r\nNanbu\u2019s previous protege, Tatsumi Aragaki, is the \u201cgenuine article\u201d of the entire series.  A man who was robbed of his legs and half of his face during a war, Aragaki struggles to find a reason to press forward in his \u201cmeaningless\u201d existence.  Much like the duality of his disfigured face, Aragaki leads a conflicted life, wanting to exact revenge on his coach through Joe, but also desiring a peaceful resolution that will alleviate some of his psychological woes.  The depiction of this character was spot on, creating a connection with the viewer in a palpable way.  The emotions that flew from Aragaki highlighted the fragile nature of all humans, reminding the viewer that one\u2019s own mind, can be the greatest opponent of all.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t engage in talking about the other character\u2019s of the show, as the vast majority were dearth of any real personality; however, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge Glen Burroughs coming out in a monster truck.  I mean, what was that?  We already know he\u2019s a boisterous American, but they really tried to hammer that point home.  Perhaps they watched some old clips of Stone Cold Steve Austin driving on his ATV to the ring, but just missed the point that the WWE was a contrived entertainment event, and not a real sporting competition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe boxing matches were, for the most part, uninspiring, and as the tournament progressed to its later stages, it became onerous for the viewer to tune in to the next episode.  Real life boxing is tedious enough (just look at the declining viewership numbers), but watching it in an anime format is all the more dreary when you consider the absurdity of the \u201cgear\u201d itself.  There were a few plot twists thrown in here and there, but nothing that made the viewer second-guess the outcome of the series as a whole.  Perhaps watching Ping Pong the Animation and Ashita no Joe has spoiled my standards for what to expect from future sports anime, yet, in the end, being judged by your peers is the only unbiased way of determining your place on the hierarchy of the sports anime genre.  And while this may seem blasphemous to some of you, I believe the first two seasons of Haikyuu!! capture character emotions with more veracity than Megalo Box.  One of the few times a Shounen anime did something better than a Seinen anime.  Not the legacy Megalo Box was attempting to solidify with its sights set on attaining the previous glory of its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.67/10",

            "content": "Edit: After two/three months of not watching anime, I finally got around to finish this masterpiece, and I still stay behind my 9 for this anime. I only changed one small bit in my review: I notched up the story from a 8 to a 9 for its great ending (well, at least in my opinion).\r\nI am a sucker for Moe/Slice of Life/Romance/Comedy type of anime, but once in awhile I like to tip my toes outside of that safe area. It introduced me to some great anime like Made In Abyss and not so great anime (*cough cough* Citrus *cough cough*). I tipped mytoes outside of my safe area again with Megalo Box and Megalo Box is a great one\u2026 actually not just great, an amazing one! Well, put on your boxing gloves and start your engines, this is my review of Megalo Box.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10  \\n\r\nIt's the typical underdog story, but executed well. Junk Dog is a really good boxer who does rigged fights for a living. When Yuri steps in the ring and kicks his ass Junk Dog wants to rematch Yuri. Yuri says he can fight him again in Megalonia, a boxing tournament. So Junk Dog joins Megalonia to fight his way up to Yuri for a rematch. The plot is pretty predictable, but who doesn't love a good underdog story?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10  \\n\r\nI adore the animation. It's incredibly atmospheric. The dark colors, the fallout like environnement and the low-but-actually-not-low quality. Some may complain about the blurry resolution, but it actually adds more to the atmosphere! This anime makes me feel nostalgic for something I never had nostalgia for. And the action scenes look incredible with some of the best fights this year already. Of all the anime I have watched this season and last season, this anime has the most impressive animation out of all of them. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10  \\n\r\nChrist on skateboard to Walmart, the soundtrack is amazing. The ED is reason why I started to watch this anime. The music in the actions scenes are great, the ED is incredible and that fucking tune in episode 2 is also incredible. The only song I don't like is the OP, which sadly knocks the score down a point. But for the rest it is amazing!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10  \\n\r\nA easy gap that a lot of MC's fall into is that they are boring. ''ooh look how so awkward and relatable they are''. Junk Dog on the other hand is probably one of the best MC's I have seen since Konosuba. You only have to look at his smirk. His smirk has more personality than the entirety of the MC's from most anime. A side character that I also really like is Nanbu Gansaku. He is a pretty knowledgeable coach who looks like he everyday gets home at 4AM. You also have the kids and for kids they are pretty likeable and not much annoying fucks. Overall a pretty enjoyable cast. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10  \\n\r\nThere is not much to say about it: I had a ton of fun watching this.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  \\n\r\nThis anime is amazing. Oh yeah, this anime is a 50th anniversary project of Ashita no Joe, but you don't need any information of Ashita no Joe to enjoy Megalo Box. That's all what I wanted to say. Get your ass off this site and begin watching this series!\\n",

            "content": "Megalo Box is an anime adaptation of the Nintendo Switch game 'Arms'. Not really, but it could as well be since both are about tool-assisted nu-boxing. \r\nFirst thing I have to mention is that I don't like this series very much unlike the 7 billion other people who are watching it. My favorite anime genre has been Sports since 2012, but this series is much closer to the Game genre. It mainly reminds me of 'Robotics:Notes', you know the 'Steins:Gate' alternative robots battle anime no one likes, and represents various things that I do not appreciate.  \r\nI have several problems with this series. Theseare: \\n\\n\r\n1) The way the boxing is presented. It's almost as if there is nothing else in the universe outside the actual Megalo Box. From its settings, it is like Mad Max with robot boxing. Cold and deserted world where there is only one thing in existence that everyone loves. This would be kinda cool if that one thing was some badass thing like shark-riding, or arm wrestling, or UNO with tea parties. I find it incredibly hard to believe that at least 96% of the population doesn't find tool-assisted boxing to be dorky as hell. \\n\\n\r\n2) The fights. What is this level of dullness even? Let me block until I die or alternatively one-hit K.O you. Ever seen the movie 'Real Steel' starred by Hugh Jackman? If you are watching Megalo Box, you are basically watching Real Steel. Later on, these fights start to remind less and less boxing and look like Beyblade instead except now people wear them instead of shooting them. \\n\\n\r\n3) The atmosphere. There is none. It's just about our main character acting tough like he matters. The main focus is on rigging the fights, and gambling. Mainly reminding me of Daredevil's past story from the movie Daredevil (2003). Apparently the real story only begins after this phase. Great. Basically filler-content in one-cour show. No matter how I look at the show, the first 2 episodes seem to serve little to no purpose whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\n4) The characters. Since this show is so heavily about Megalo Box, it even forgot to give past story or even a current story for the main character. It's almost as if our main character was discovered from nothing. How am I supposed to care about anything that is happening when the things I know about our maing character are a) he loves motorbikes b) he is terrible at driving them. \"Wooo! Go for it. I am totally rooting for you mr. bikes!\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things that I liked too, but these are few. The OST has some nice tracks in it. That motorcycle scene in episode 3 was definitely a badass one. \"A man walks into a bar.\" Made me lol. I'd also like to praise the retro art but I simply can't. Japan is constantly getting blu-ray releases for 70's and 80's classic anime. Those who have seen any of them know that there is nothing sharper than old anime. So what did Megalo Box team decide to do? Add filthers that make the video seem partially pixelated, out of focus and colors look washed out. This is the furthest from retro.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Ashita no Joe, I didn't like Joe's character much outside pig surffing (heh, obscure reference), he was a real brick, but at least he was a character who had an actual life and who went thru enormous amounts of development, becoming a decent human being during the run. There is no chance of this happening in Megalo Box without having at least 3-cours. If this is how we're tributing Ashita no Joe, then I would much rather take 4th season of Hajime no Ippo instead of some marketing bait which relies on western appeal.\\n\\n\r\n*Please note that this is just my honest opinion. Many love the show and that's cool too.*\\n",

            "content": "There\u2019s an infamous quote in the wrestling community that was said by the legendary Ric Flair. \u201cTo be the man, you gotta beat the man!\u201d While Megalo Box is not wrestling, there\u2019s definitely an iconic meaning that can be applied here. As I was watching Megalo Box, it reminded me the excitement of fighting. A few years ago when Hajime no Ippo returned on television, it became a glorious showstopper that lived up to all expectations. For Megalo Box, this was like a feeling of deja vu.\r\nThe premise of the series involves Junk Dog, an underground Megalo Boxer. He participates in a popular sport intheir world known as Megalo Boxing. What is Megalo Boxing? It\u2019s basically a sport that involves boxers fighting with metal gears. Think of it as boxing but with more lethal and brutal consequences. Junk Dog takes on the moniker name \u201cJoe\u201d so he can participate in the Megalonia tournament. Throughout the series, we see his life journey as both a Megalo Boxer and person. \\n\\n\r\nOn my first viewing, Megalo Box made an intimidating and fascinating impression on me. I haven\u2019t seen the original Ashita no Joe series before so coming into this anime fresh felt intimidating at first. On the other hand, I\u2019m also fascinated by the larger than life ideas of the show. The first two episodes immediately had me glued to my seat as we witness Junk Dog showing his fighting skills as a Megalo Boxer. It didn\u2019t take long to realize that the show portrays him as an underdog. The experience that Joe gains is invaluable and also allows him to realize his potential. I\u2019m also a sucker for the \u201cDavid vs Goliath\u201d trope as the idea can be applied in any sport. For Megalo Box, the stakes are raised higher because of how dangerous it is. Every fight feels as if Joe is putting his life on the life against opponents. And believe me, the characters he comes across with are no pushovers. Take Yuuri as an example. He is a Megalo Boxing champion and is considered one of the top fighters in the world. In a classic \u2018David vs Goalith\u2019 style fight, he humiliates Junk Dog in his match. The fight inspires Junk Joe to climb up the ranks and make a name for himself. It planted the seeds for Junk Dog to not only improve but also show why he deserves to be a Megalo Boxer. Junk Dog later takes on the ring name \u201cGearless Joe\u201d because of his own choice to fight without gears in the ring.\\n\\n\r\nNow I have to be honest here and wonder what makes a good boxing story. Is it about the development of character in and out of the ring? Does it also involve a fighter going beyond than just a fictional character? Or maybe it\u2019s a story that always keeps up coming back for more. Perhaps it\u2019s how much the story draws lines between fiction and reality. Personally, I think Megalo Box has a bit of every one of those aspects. Junk Dog goes against his manager Nanbu to throw a fight and takes control of his own destiny. This is a contrast to Yuuri who often follows the command of Yukiko, the head of the Shirato Group who oversees the Megalonia tournament. There\u2019s a good contrasting comparison between these two characters as it feels like they are living in two different worlds.  It also impressed me on how much Junk Dog is willing to go to prove himself. This is shown later in the series when he fights Aragaki, with both physical and emotional stakes. It escalated to the point where both fighters eventually took on an all-brawl approach to see who the last man standing. In perhaps one of the most important fights of Junk Joe\u2019s life, he proves himself as a warrior. \\n\\n\r\nFor a sports show, there\u2019s no doubt psychology is also involved in the ring. The gimmicks, trash talk, and press conferences hypes up match-ups between opponents. A big selling factor also involves the emotional quality of the show. I can\u2019t help but root for Junk Dog early on in the series. He\u2019s the underdog and for him to beat certain opponents is relatable. It sends across the message that anyone can do anything they set their mind into. While this seems like a cheesy gimmick for the show, it\u2019s very real and the buildup for some of Joe\u2019s matches is executed flawlessly. On the other hand, Megalo Box does suffer a bit on the drama side if we look beyond the ring. Some of the subplot involving Yukiko clashing with the board of directors makes a less memorable impact to connect the series together. The family feud between Yukiko and Mikio also feels like it doesn\u2019t belong in a show like this. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I like a good drama from time to time but the way their plot is carried out just doesn't sell well. On the other hand, the rivalries between the fighters is what got me really invested into the story. Junk Dog/Yuuri, Junk Dog/Mikio, and Mikio/Yuuri are all rivalries that stays committed to selling this show. What I\u2019m also more invested in is how far Joe goes out to prove himself. He is very committed to his goal even if it means putting his own life on the line and taking jaw dropping risks. The guy knows what he wants to accomplish in life and to me, that\u2019s an attitude you need to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nProduced by TMS Entertainment, it\u2019s may take a while for viewers to get used to the animation style. The characters looks like they are hand drawn and creates a sensation of the 1990s. The characters are rough looking especially for our main protagonist, Junk Dog. There\u2019s no doubt the anime was aiming make the characters look as badass as possible. The addition of the gears these fighters wear adds more aesthetics to raise the stakes. However, the biggest selling point of the anime\u2019s technical quality is the actual fighting. It really isn\u2019t hard to spot how intense the action is once the fight gets into a momentum. Every punch feels impactful and camera angles captures the realism of the pain. It\u2019s never camera shy to show blood on screen and how fighters react to their win or losses. Every fight can get viewers\u2019 heart throbbing. The emotional impact can also be felt with the protrayal of human expressions. In terms of boxing, it also delivers its quality action such as uppercuts, corkscrew punches, jabbing, overhands, etc. Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting how well the show\u2019s dystopia setting is portrayed without overemphasizing element of science fiction. Sure, the series place in a futuristic environment but also shows the reality of cruelness such as poverty. If the creators were aiming for making this anime feel real, they sure got their job done.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not too familiar with Katsuhiko Manabe but the music talent he brings into this anime is undeniably stylish. The fighting music amplifies the hip-pop style of the OST to bring in a lot of attitude into the series. The soundtrack is mesmerizing that always keeps its momentum from the minute the first beat hits. In the meantime, I\u2019m also impressed by the voices of the character cast especially our protagonist Junk Dog. His personality matches with his voice that almost sounds like a fierce dog when fighting in the ring. The masculinity of all the fighters is believable because of the talented voice cast. Both the OP and ED theme songs also reflects a bit of the 1990s mood that may feel nostalgic. \\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box definitely turned out to be a dark horse that I\u2019m glad I gave a chance this year. What started out as a fight turned into an emotional story that follows the heart of an underdog. I\u2019m in awe of how much I became invested into Joe\u2019s character before even realizing his potential. While this anime may not be suitable for everyone, it\u2019s still an anime that can keep just about anyone at their seat. Here is a series that made a name for itself in just 13 phenomenal episodes.",

            "content": "I have never been interested in the sport of boxing. I didn't have anything against it, but, back then, the chance of me watching an actual match or something related to the sport itself would be as big as the understanding of the Internet of a 90-year-old grandpa. However, everything changed after I had watched Hajime no Ippo, as not only I truly enjoyed it to the fullest, but it also sparked an odd interest in the previously avoided sport. Naturally, when I noticed that in the Spring of 2018, there's going to be an anime centred around the said sport called Megalo Box, Igot hyped, set my expectations pretty high and well, they were met to a fair degree.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a narrative point of view, this show is a pretty average, bog standard story about an underdog boxer. You've got your protagonist, accurately named Joe (Junk Dog), climbing the leaderboards in order to beat the champion, with the help of his coach and support from his friends and fans alike. However, this is where the similarities to other classic underdog stories end. In the subtlely built dystopian world, they inhabit, there are power-enhancing mechanical arms called Gears. They serve both as a plot element everything revolves around and as a metaphor for the theme of \"fake boxing\". They are the technology that revolutionalised the modern concept of said sports discipline. If you wanted to be a boxer yourself, you had to buy an expensive Gear, because otherwise, when it comes to power and durability, you wouldn't stand a chance in the ring. It's an effective system from both economical and \"spectator's\" point of view. Who wouldn't like to see a brawl between 2 men with robot-like machinery on their shoulders? No one, therefore a system like that can have a place in the society and be a near perfect business, yet, with such an advancement came the loss of down-to-earth, genuine boxing, of which matches are decided by skill and effort put into improving it rather than one's equipment. The man using nothing but a pure talent that will shatter the concept of \"fake boxing\" is Joe himself. After being defeated by Yuuri, he decides to end his life filled with throwing matches in an underground ring and without any sort of Gear, he commences his journey to Megalonia, to encounter what a real (Megalo)boxing is, and as he pushes forward, he continues to prove that he's the genuine article; the real deal. Well, this is all Megalo Box is sadly about; it's a near perfect example of themes over attention to seemingly trivial yet crucial details. Even though I love such an uncomplicated yet ingenious concept when it comes down to matches and pacing, they are quite a rocky road. As the latter one is more or less solid throughout the story, the core of a boxing show, the matches themselves, more often than not, lack genuine weight, which may not reduce the viewer's enjoyment per se, yet they don't leave much of an impact after the dust settles. Such a situation would never take place if...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the weakest aspects of Megalo Box didn't happen to be its characters. Don't get me wrong, they have amazing personalities and designs, but I've never felt invested in even one of them. Joe is the prime example of that. Throughout the show's duration, we learn little to none about his past, his origins or how he met his future coach. Why is he such a skilled fighter? Is he a natural born boxer or maybe he acquired such a level of talent because of the harsh environment? We don't know that, in fact, we know nothing. Yes, there's one flashback when we see the exact moment Joe and Nanbu first spoke to each other, but what about it? Well, besides discovering that he has siblings, we get nothing from it. And this lack of attention placed on creating the backstory made Joe, even though he has both the look and characteristics of a total badass of the 90s, which I wholeheartedly treasure and respect, into a character I can root for, but at the same time, am apathetic towards. Nanbu and Sachio, on the other hand, served their roles quite well and grew with show's progression. Both of these personages received something that our main protagonist could only dream of: proper character arcs. In case of Nanbu, most of the process of developing and humanising his persona happened both at and before the match between his previous pupil and Joe. We could see him in his now non-existing gym, work as a coach of Aragaki, a wonderfully introduced supporting character, and how big of a burden he carries, as he let his boxer down. And by the end of the journey, he morphed from a selfish scorpion that used others to save himself into a selfless man who cared about his comrades. Sachio is kind of a mixed bag for me. In the beginning, he was a pretty pesky brat, but as we saw his troubled past, we started to understand him and the reason why he thought of Joe the way he did. Other supporting characters are solid for the most part, well, besides Yuuri, who's only character trait for 11 episodes was serving Shirato family and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nProduction value-wise, this anime is an absolute masterwork. Both visually and aurally, this show oozes with such a heck ton of style and testosterone that I was left speechless many times. These retro-stylized aesthetics fit the brutal and harsh plot, shape the dystopian cities and slum surroundings and create an atmospheric tone to near perfection. One might say that the downsampling its footage was a grievous mistake, but to that, I must say no, even though I would like to see those gorgeous backgrounds in high detail.  Such a treatment gave the show it's unique unpolished and dirty feel and an unmatched personality, no other modern anime could offer. Every single track you can hear in the show is indescribably brilliant and blood pumping. I swear to God, my blood pressure skyrocketed into heaven's whenever one of these, especially Megalo Box theme and  Bangaichi theme, made an appearance. Free goosebumps!\\n\\n\r\nSo, to say that I merely enjoyed this series would be a blasphemy, goddamnit, I fricking adore it. There's nothing more satisfying and entertaining than a craft with visible effort put in, that is so enjoyable to watch, that you are, quite literally, waiting with an ominous anticipation every single week to see the next episode and there wasn't a single point where I felt bored or thought that the action I was witnessing on my screen was prolonged. Who's at fault? I guess that the audiovisual's played the most significant role in making me feel the way I felt, and hey, that's not surprising when we take into consideration how amazing they are.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile it certainly has its flaws, which can sometimes be a humongous eyesore, Megalo Box is one of the most exciting, fresh and manliest work of the Spring season, and heck, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of the sport, you will get pumped and hyped for every single bit of action out there. Full of raw, dirty and unrefined style, this retro like experience is, truly, the real deal.",

            "content": "I thought I'd throw in my two bits of info. Megalo Box is set in kind of this steampunk futuristic type setting where boxing apparently is still big...of all things. We've got our run of the mill down-and-out character who just wants to have a good fight. You might be thinking \"Boxing? Eh, not really my thing.\" To be honest, boxing isn't really my thing either. BUT, the character writing in this story is very well done. The animation is well done. Voice acting, at least right now, is believable. You might stray away from it because of how the art looks but don't letthat drive you away, that hand drawn stuff is done on purpose. It feels odd to say this but it makes it look grittier. Instead of that really polished clean stuff when they combine the 2-d with 3-d and everyone has these perfect faces, nah, this is the good stuff. The fights are some of the best animated sequences I've seen in a long time. They don't do that thing where someone throws a punch and it shows a still frame while the camera shakes to simulate the force of the punch, nope, its all animated and it looks great. The dialogue itself is not scholarly by any stretch of the imagination, but the decisions these guys make seem...real. They get sad, angry, happy, by regular stuff. I think when you just have an anime about some guys or girls that are just regular people it makes it a little better. I think for what they are trying to do can be fit into 12 episodes, but this is an anime that I wished was longer, and I haven't thought that in a long time.",

            "content": "In spite of all the hype that Megalo Box created from it\u2019s first few episodes, it became one of the biggest disappoints of the season. At first, it presents a familiar inspirational sports story with a vague setting to get you interested in the well-directed boxing matches. But by the end, the writing is still incredibly shallow. Megalo Box is just a carbon copy of the generic underdog boxing story, but slightly worse than the classics it desperately tries to imitate.\r\nAside from the addition of Gear, exoskeletons to enhance the boxers fighting, Megalo Box tells the very standard tale of a misfortunate boxer Junk Dog.He\u2019s wasting his talent away throwing matches for cash, a diamond in the rough who thinks he has no chance at making it big. He had long since given up his dream to become the champion of the boxing world Megalonia because he lacks the documentation to enter the tournament. When he happens to cross paths with Yuri, the current Megalo Box champion, they enter a heated rivalry that makes him feel enough passion for boxing. Of course, in their first fight, he\u2019s crushed. But now he has to climb his way to the top of Megalonia and prove himself worthy of a rematch. Throughout his journey through the ranks, he faces many foes and learns to trust in himself and others\u2026 you can guess how the rest goes even if you haven\u2019t seen it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an underdog story of the most generic mold, and it plays out exactly as you expect. Never was I surprised by any development, whether a twist in character or an outcome of the many boxing matches. Any nuances the show has are only superficial and do nothing to elevate the conventional plot structure. It seems like the inclusion of the exoskeletons all the boxers wear and other sci-fi elements were not to strengthen the story, it\u2019s more just for the sake of making things look cool. The only nuance the Gear adds is the fact that it represents a system that the protagonist defies by removing. Sure this makes him seem like a badass for fighting against mechanically power fighters and challenging the world\u2019s standards for the sport, but we already knew what the outcome of his fights would be anyways. Not to mention the gear doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s sci-fi without the science.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an argument to be made that predictability is not an inherently bad thing and sometimes beneficial in a story that sets out to emulate the classics. Being a reboot of the classic Ashita no Joe (which I haven\u2019t seen) it is expected to share some similarities to the older boxing stories. However, Megalo Box does not add to the formula previously established, it simply uses it to present a series with passable production values but writing that does nothing to surprise. It takes more than just imitating the best to become great, but it could help to be at least on the same level of quality of what you\u2019re trying to imitate. That\u2019s what Megalo Box is, desperate to be seen as one of the classics that it forgets to create an experience that can stand on its own merits. \\n\\n\r\nA muddy, washed out color palette covers the whole series, suited to the dystopian setting. If it was their intention to make the show look like a classic anime similar to Cowboy Bebop, they failed, deliberately downgrading the resolution only made the show seem fuzzier and less refined. A grimy washed out color palette covers the whole series, with a low resolution making lines fuzzier. There\u2019s no respite, even the supposedly advanced sci-fi city is unremarkable. Megalo Box doesn\u2019t get really violent until later in it\u2019s run, but even then its lacking the bite a gritty boxing series should have. The lines should be sharper, eye-catching, but instead, the art is soft and gray; its tiresome style would fit a show with less tension like a slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nI spent more time trying to engage with Megalo Box rather than being engaged because the action it so heavily emphasized is nothing special. Even the fighting typically only consists of the basic punches and blocks despite the sci-fi tacked on elements. The animation isn\u2019t fluid enough for them to have the impact of the real thing, and they\u2019re not exaggerated enough to stand up against current shounen. For many of the fights Joe is typically beaten up and on the brink of defeat fight, struggling through most of the fight, only to turn it around at the last second with a single punch. This formula for the fights is repeated over and over until they lose any spark of excitement seen in the first episodes. Megalo Box quickly becomes predictable and frankly, boring, which is a death sentence for a show literally about sci-fi exoskeleton boxing. \\n\\n\r\nI get that a lot of the stakes in boxing stories comes from what\u2019s happening with the characters involved. But the people Joe fights are typically one-dimensional ciphers that are seen once and rarely again. Even the main character himself, Junk Dog (eventually Joe), has very little to him. He\u2019s your typical underdog who\u2019s lost confidence in himself because the world denied it to him, but gradually gains it back in combat. At many points, the series does a good job of cluing you into how he\u2019s reacting to the fights with close-ups and the exhilarating music. Whenever he\u2019s out of a fight it\u2019s typically very clear what\u2019s going on in his head because the situation he\u2019s in is already one you can recognize.\\n\\n\r\nI wish the side characters could have made up for what Joe lacked, but they\u2019re equally shallow with predictable arcs. Joe\u2019s manager Nanbu frustratingly jumps back and forth in progression, which to the show\u2019s credit, is suited to his emotionally damaged character. He\u2019s molded by the fixed boxing system to divide himself from the fighters he trains; struggling put faith in Joe\u2019s journey to Megalonia because he has seen how much power those in control have. Then there\u2019s Sachio, the token little kid with big dreams who follows Joe around ever since he saved him and his group of friends from the slums. His friends can be combined into one character because they offer an equal amount of development: none at all. Simply being there to cheer Joe on during matches is the extent of their impact on the show. They\u2019re not terrible as characters, they fit in the setting, have motivations and arcs, but they\u2019re so archetypal I couldn\u2019t muster up a reason to care for either of them. With exception of Yuri, the main rival who gets no motivation to fight other than 'he likes to fight.' Watching him fight didn't offer any excitement because I never knew anything about him. Even his manager Yukiko had nothing to her other than inserting evilness into the plot; she's selling Gear to the military? There was so much potential for commentary, but the show drops her side plot entirely by the second half; much like the rest of its compelling themes, Megalo Box simply uses them as window dressing to appear intelligent without bothering to actually develop them.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the arena boxing, the rest of the time is spent in the wasteland setting. There isn\u2019t much else occurring in Megalo Box\u2019s world other than the boxing, which is why everyone gets so excited over Joe entering Megalonia despite being from the slums. Frankly, the amount of people who love the sport feels a little hamfisted, the setting is never explained enough for it to be believable. There\u2019s no MadMax style apocalypse that has left everyone bloodthirsty scavengers, it\u2019s just the sandy slums and the big city which controls the sport. I wish the series had at least explored more of the implications about Joe not being a citizen and therefore not being allowed to join the tournament; it\u2019s an interesting theme considering the current state of immigration in Japan is not good. Sadly, expecting Megalo Box to add modern nuance was too much and that theme is resolved entirely by him simply receiving a citizenship after fighting a few times. There\u2019s a bit of fanfare on the plot development, but like most conflicts in the show it is easily resolved and predictable. \\n\\n\r\nAttempting to watch Megalo Box the way it wants you to, as a classic, is such a struggle. You can\u2019t love it without constantly making concessions, the visuals are deliberately of mediocre quality, the story is deliberately very cliched, the characters are deliberately barebones. Even if it just wanted to be an enjoyable homage to the classics, drawing such close inspiration from them will only lead to the audience unconsciously comparing it and being inevitably disappointed at how this new series just does not do enough to be better.",

            "content": "If there was one anime that I would love to get a remake it would be Ashita no Joe.  I really series especially the manga for its great boxing matches, amazing rivalry, and wonderful and realistic character development. The series also had great darker portrayal of boxing as sport where not all matches will not end pretty as boxers can potentially get injured to a point where they get they lives destroyed. Thanks to these elements that the show offers as well being a great realistic coming of age + underdog story Ashita no Joe is currently my favourite sports anime/manga series period evenbeating  the likes of Haikyuu and Chihayafuru even thought I adored them but personally they don\u2019t compete the absolute greatness that is Ashita no Joe in my opinion. So when I heard the Ashita no Joe 50th project I was beyond hype because I thought my wish had came true where anime fans from this generation can finally experience the dark beauty that is Ashita no Joe in a modernize fashion. However instead of getting a Ashita no Joe remake we got Megalo Box a anime that was mean to celebrate Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary.\\n\r\nAs a fan of Ashita no Joe franchise I was really excited for it as it thought it will be great tribute to Ashita no Joe as well being its own thing and I first I liked it a lot. However as a I watch more episodes the show slowly started to fall apart to a point where all of my excitement of the show was replaced by boredom and disappointment.\\n\r\nSo what the hell went wrong with this show? \\n\r\nYou\u2019re going to find out now. Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Megalo Box and with that further ado let\u2019s started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows Junk Dog who is great at boxing who fights in underground illegal rings in fights that have a fixed result where his coach Gansaku Nanbu directs him on when to lose a fight. One evening he almost crashes his motorcycle into Yukiko Shirato, who is the head of the wealthy Shirato Group which oversees the Megalonia tournament; Junk Dog picks a fight with her bodyguard Y\u016bri who is also the top ranked Megalo Boxer. Yukiko stops the fight but Y\u016bri seeks out Junk Dog and meets him in the underground ring where he easily beats the less-experienced fighter and tells him to fight him again in Megalonia, which Junk Dog would need a place at the top of the official Megalo Box rankings to qualify for, as well as a proper citizenship ID to enter the rankings in the first place. After Nanbu persuades the mob boss Fujimaki to forge Junk Dog an ID under the name Joe, the two are given 3 months to achieve their goal of working their way to the top of the Megalonia tournament rankings in order for Joe to have his re-match against Yuri.\\n\r\nAm just going to say right now the story is only good if you never seen a underdog story in your life because this is by far the most typical underdog character driven story I have ever seen.\\n\r\nThe first big mistake that this show it\u2019s that is one of those climbing to the top to fight against the person who kicked your ass type of plot where the only reason why set character is even fighting is just to have re-match against the person who beat.\\n\r\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been so much of a problem if Joe actually grow as a character but doesn\u2019t because by episode 11 he\u2019s still that same bland fighter from episode 11. Yes I will admit he does change slightly in the final two episodes but it was far too late because he\u2019s character change just felt like a afterthought thanks to the show wasting it\u2019s time on dragged out subplots which while they were interesting it overstayed it\u2019s welcome. \\n\r\nAnother issue that I have with Megalo Box were the subplots. Don\u2019t me wrong they were pretty good but the problem is almost every single subplot in the show seem to overshadow Joe\u2019s progression meaning that side characters in this show were more fleshed out than Joe himself where he barely gets a spotlight outside of fighting. \\n\r\nThis doesn\u2019t induce the other things such as pacing, and writing which were lacklustre at best \\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the show is predictable as hell where every single fight minus the plot convenience ones like the first Yuri fight start and end in the same way. \\n\\n\r\nThis is how a typical Megalo Box fight is structure.\\n\r\n1. Joe set up for fight \\n\r\n2. Joe practices \\n\r\n3. Joe goes to fight \\n\r\n4. Joe gets his ass handed to him for 99% of the fight \\n\r\n5. Joe wins with 1 punch.\\n\r\nSee the problem here. I usually don\u2019t mind shows that have a predictable nature but I feel like Megalo Box took it a next level where once you see the first two boxing matches not counting the Yuri fight you can very easily notice a nasty pattern for each fight and because of that the fights sadly have become boring and tedious to watch. I know this is a character driven show where the sport itself is not main focus but could you make the fight more tension? By the end of the third fight I got sick and tired of watching Joe\u2019s matches because he will only win by asspulling with that lucky punch of he\u2019s \\n\r\nThe biggest issue with this show is that it feels like a soul less cash grab to a beloved series. What I mean by this is that it has all the elements of Ashita no Joe but it\u2019s too afraid to become its own thing.\\n\r\nYes the setting is different and some of the plot elements but other than that you only just tone down version to arguably the best sports manga/anime ever made.\\n\r\nOverall the story is pretty bad and uninspiring.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters in Megalo Box I thought they were all underwhelming at best with two expectations.\\n\\n\r\nGearless Joe is such a terrible protagonist.  We the audience barely know anything about Joe from his past to how he became the person that he is in Episode 1. His motivation is paper fin as he only wants to the enter the Megalo Box tournament for a rematch against Yuri again in a boxing match. Not for pride or carrier reasons mind you just for a silly re-match a guy who beat you in the ring. The worst thing about him is he\u2019s bland personality and lack of actual character development because as from episode 11 he is still the bland boring character that we seen from episode 1 where he still only wants\u2019 to have a rematch against Yuri. Maybe I was spoiled because I seen Ashita no Joe and Hajime no Ippo first but in all seriousness Joe is a terrible protagonist who barely has any depth at all.\\n\r\nOn the other hand Nanbu is a pretty good character in his own right. Compare to the blandless Joe Nanbu is actually a charming and relatable character that is a great voice of reason for Joe. Also he has a well told back-story that actually explains in detail why he became the person that he is from episode 1 as a grumpy person. Easily the best character in the show in terms of character development \\n\r\nSachio is by far my favourite character because not only he is a another great voice of reason for Joe he\u2019s a very fun and likable character who get\u2019s well developed as the series goes on. Not to mention he\u2019s more interesting subplot then Joe\u2019s paper fin rise to the top to beat set guy \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters inducing the shitty rival Rishiki clone Yuri are all one note and forgetful.\\n\r\nOverall apart from Sachio and Nanbu the characters in Megalo Box were very disappointing at best.\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Megalo Box is good and has that gritty feel that I liked.\\n\r\nThe art style reminds me off Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop with its more westernise and gritty look from the background scenery, some of the characters to even the use of gritty colour pallets. \\n\r\nAs for the animation itself this is where the show falls apart again.\\n\r\nAm not talking the animation where they not fighting in ring because that\u2019s pretty good overall. Am talking about the boxing matches themselves which were all subpar and boring. It was already bad enough that Joe easily wins his fights thanks to his asspulling lucky punch but almost every single fight in the show is lifeless and lacks any real tension. Am not asking that Megalo Box show relay on style over substance but if the show can\u2019t story and character elements right you just end up being one hell of a boring and lifeless show. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThankfully the soundtrack is easily the best part about the series.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great and well directed. It\u2019s really fits with the gritty of the series and it really makes the show\u2019s atmosphere more appealing to the eyes.\\n\r\nThe opening theme is decent itself but it\u2019s not that memorable.\\n\r\nThe ending theme on the other hand is amazing that has a great 80s vibe to it\\n\r\nThe Seiyuus did a pretty good job with the roles that they were given in this anime\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack is great and memorable but honestly having a great soundtrack along will not suddenly make an anime good because saying Megalo Box is great because of the soundtrack a is like saying that Gundam Seed + Destiny  is great because of the soundtrack. While the soundtrack for those shows are great it doesn\u2019t have enough substance to back up its soundtrack\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nDisappointment is honestly the best way to describe Megalo Box as a whole. It was a anime that I wanted to love but constantly keep on disappointing me the more I watch it with its subpar plot, lacklustre fight choreography thanks to asspulls and mediocre overall characters. The only good things about this show are the music and the art-style.\\n\r\nAt best this show is below average and at worse it\u2019s a train-wreck that I dislike a lot.\\n\r\nUnless you\u2019re very new to sports anime I recommend you to avoid this show and checking out Hajime no Ippo or better Ashita no Joe instead of this disappointing mess of a show.\\n\r\nThe show may be just a celebration of Joe legacy but it doesn\u2019t excuse the subpar quality of this series. \\n\r\nFinal Score 4/10\\n",

            "content": "[Spoilers]\r\nSo what I'm about to say is controversial and make people angry, but Megalo Box is a boring mediocre anime and is such. \r\nArc 1: Story;5\r\nIt's simple and not really to revolutionary. It's about our MC trying to prove he's a good boxer and wants to participate in Megalo tournament to step in someones ring. And to add insult to injury the execution isn't really great. The decisions in anime are admittedly retarded and how can anyone call this a future great is beyond me. Compared to HnI or AnJ it really pales a lot in what it's supposed to do.  Really not muchto discuss.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Art and Sound; 6 \\n\r\nThe animation is really weird and sometimes outright ugly. Whoever directed this thought like an Instagram thot and told to put a ton of filters on the shows. The art would be better as it really can show, but the filters are ruining it. Honestly for being an anniversary project, It really looks ugly and flat. Heck the fight scenes highlight this problem as the way they fight is slow and stiff. The sound doesn't also have much as you can barely notice it unless they blare rap and an ost at a time.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: Characters; 4\\n\r\nHow can you write the dumbest characters in an anniversary? Joe is an alright character and Nanbu is pretty on point with both having dumb moments. Now the other characters are the epitome of fucking cancer and forgettable characters.  Yuri is literally just a dog of a rich girl and you really can't even have a connection with him at all. Fujimaki is the traditional gangster and Yukiko is the generic rich girl. Now Sachio is fucking dumb. Literally the definition of wow that's just lazy. He literally knows how gears work with no explanation and is now a second for Joe. Guys this has to be the laziest writing for a show that is rated highly and people are defending the kid too. Stop and address this show has problems with the characters instead.\\n\\n\r\nArc 4: Enjoyment and overall; 4.5 \\n\r\nThis is a mediocre show that has been overblown and I just can't stand how people are enjoying this show. It's boring but overblown. For a AnJ anniversary, this is probably the worst anime for that. Once this show is done I will do a full on review of this show and what it does wrong and why it's mediocre in detail rather than a preview. I doubt this will get better, but if it can fix the issues I found with the show then maybe I my opinion will change. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendations is AnJ and HnI as they both are way better in every aspect of what this show can't do.",

            "content": "...I gave it a few days to think about. I cannot give Megalo Box any score higher than a 4. I really wanted to enjoy Megalo Box. While I initially did, the excitement I had for the series steadily died out with each passing week. The characters got less interesting, the fights got less intense,  and it just became so predictable and lackluster. \r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters. We have Joe, the main character and focus. For some reason, he\u2019s basically made of adamantium so he can take hundreds of blows, get his ass knocked to the ground, but will always magically get rightback up as if it never happened. Meanwhile, his opponents almost always get one hit by Joe\u2019s well placed punch to go down instantly. Joe wants nothing but to fight and win. Every fight, he\u2019s essentially just a punching bag until he gets that one good punch. Joe makes all of these fights so damn predictable and boring to see. It was like watching these boxers punch a brick wall until they got too tired. They weren\u2019t intense. They weren\u2019t interesting. Joe wasn\u2019t interesting. \\n\r\nNanbu was the typical boxing coach. Harsh on the outside, cares a little on the inside, used to be a really good coach but is now washed up. He was probably the only thing worth remembering from the anime. He had some great development as the anime progressed. \\n\r\nSachio brought nothing to the anime. His role was to scream Joe\u2019s name constantly whenever Joe got knocked down. That\u2019s basically all. There was a subplot with him and his parents at one point, but it really served no purpose whatsoever in terms of story or character development.\\n\r\nAll the other boxers were kind of interesting to see. The ones from different countries actually spoke their original language which was really cool. However, none of them really differed in the ring. I know boxing can be very straightforward, but the anime really should\u2019ve taken the liberty to focus on all the types of fighting styles of each boxer. That would\u2019ve made them stand out more and perhaps even remember their damn names outside the central \u201cantagonist\u201d Yuri.\\n\r\nThe story offered nothing of interest to me. The premise was promising at first, a normal boxer taking on these boxers with mechanical \u201cgears\u201d to deliver powerful blows, but as I talked about earlier, the fights all followed a similar pattern. Joe get demolished during the fight, gets knocked down, Sachio screams, Joe gets back up, hits the opponent in the face to win. Rinse and repeat. There was one fight earlier in the anime that went against this formula and I truly wish the anime made the other fights stand out more like that one. There were a few plot twists outside the boxing ring, but nothing major enough to last more than an episode before moving on to the next fight.\\n\r\nBy now, everyone knows about the art style of Megalo Box. It\u2019s a nice callback. At times however, you really wish it weren\u2019t. The video quality really suffered at times in order to capture that feel of a 90\u2019s anime. This will be the one thing people will recall about the anime a year down the line. It\u2019ll be the thing people praise it for. It\u2019s simply just a nice touch in my mind.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was the best thing about the anime. That alone was better than anything in the anime and deserves its own score. Sadly, the soundtrack alone can\u2019t make the fights exciting or make the characters shine. \\n\r\nOverall, Megalo Box was disappointing. To me, it felt like wasted potential the farther I got into the series. Even the final battle in Episode 13 was disappointing. Megalo Box is an anime about dropping the ball. It sets up for some amazing fights and potential greatness just to drop the ball. And it does so over and over. It\u2019ll pick up the ball, make the viewers excited about what it could possibly do with said ball, just to drop it onto the floor as it always has. After awhile, you just expect Megalo Box to drop the ball each time and it just becomes dull and forgettable.\\n\r\nBut at least there was good music playing.",

            "content": "This is an outstanding anime. It feels nostalgic without feeling old, it feels gritty without feeling rusty, it feels grounded without feeling basic. Everything it sets out to do it does perfectly - and at that point it never forgets what it wants to be.\r\nStory is a 9/10 so far because it gave itself enough time to give us setpieces, and made them easy to understand. We have clear motivations for all characters and we dont just have \"good guy, bad guy\". We have a clear goal for the whole series and the struggle is very apparent as well. It is told without hesitation, whichdoes in small occasions feel too hasty - but its still at a reasonable pace and fits to a specific time-dependent portion of the story too.\\n\r\nTheres nothing unnecessary in this story and everything thats there is there for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt is a 10/10. Its stylized, well themed, beautiful to look at, and not even once does it feel janky. Animations aren't just beautiful though: Every kind of motion has weight and meaning behind it. This is what anime can be when looked beyond conventions.\\n\\n\r\nSound is a 10/10 as well. Everything sounds heavy, the fights have a really strong sound design. The music goes for a clearly specific feel, and while it might not be everyones taste, it serves a very specific purpose for the quite underground feel of our MC.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the 10/10 characters, which are, honestly, probably the highlight of the entire series. By themselves they might seem \"bare bones\" but they are clear personalities that are in stark contrast to each other. They have conflict, individual interests and interact in a very unpredictable way that makes them go beyond \"good and bad guys\" - we don't follow the MC because he is the good guy. We follow the MC because he sets out to be the guy.\\n\\n\r\nI can only recommend this anime to everyone. Even though this is a boxing anime, don't expect something like Hajime no Ippo. In HnI, the fights have long build up, the fights are slow and each punch is shown to have real heavy hits. In Megalo Box, its not about the individual fights - albeit being gorgeous and incredibly choreographed. It's about the path to the top, and everything in this anime aids this single purpose. If you want incredibly deep boxing matchups with unique techniques that have to be \"figured out\" this might not be for you, but if you want a fighters spirit anime about a struggling stray dog, this is the perfect choice.",

            "content": "Megalo Box has very little to do with the art of fighting itself. There is no emphasis on technique. There is no weight training. There is no satisfying payout following the arduous process of a fighter desperately trying (and often, failing) to improve their skill. There is the bizzare inclusion of gear technology that grants fighters additional strength at cost of speed - a useless consequence with speed being paramount in combat. So how can an anime that revolves around fighting, but offers none of the impertinent detail of fighting, and is decidedly worse than its predecessors Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe intheir depictions of fighting, be celebrated as one of the best releases of the year?\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box succeeds in three areas that usually manage to garner an overwhelmingly favorable response from the audience regardless of the surrounding flaws -\\n\\n\r\n1) Appealing visual aesthetic. This is an attractive looking anime with well defined, distinct looking character designs and a realistic impoverished setting juxtaposed against the futuristic wealth of Megalonia\\n\\n\r\n2) Epic soundtrack. A contender for best of the year, striking an impressive balance of relaxing and blood throttling beats\\n\\n\r\n3) No nonsense lead character who has to fight his way to the top, seemingly against all the odds\\n\\n\r\nA combination of the first two makes the anime feel atmospheric, immersing the viewer into the setting and creating a base level of entertainment from visuals and music alone. The impressive presentation makes it all the more disappointing that the fight animation is rigid and monotonous, more so resembling a match of rock em' sock em' robots than an actual high octane competition. This may even be an insult to rock em' sock em' where at the very least arms move rapidly. Slow motion is overused during fights as opposed to displaying the rapid fire jab strings and punch combinations that makes boxing so exhilarating to watch. The aforementioned lack of technique means scarce evasion tactics are used, eliminating arguably the most exciting aspect of fighting where an ill-timed whiff is met with a devastating punish. The fights in Megalo Box are rather forgettable, and at times even a chore to watch. You\u2019d think this would be a death knell for an anime that is centered around hand to hand combat, but this is apparently less important than a pretty aesthetic, a downloadable soundtrack and a lead character that doesn't have bitchmade tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the selling point of an underdog fighting his way the top against the odds, in truth Joe is disadvantaged as a \"gearless\" fighter when gears are generally proven to be useless anyway. If anything, he's being given a significant advantage in speed, an apparently natural proficiency in boxing, and somehow being able to match the power of geared opponents despite not having a gear himself and not being particularly muscular. This Joe is a far cry from the other, infinitely more engaging Yabuki Joe who had to overcome a gauntlet of mental and physical maladies to reach the height of the boxing world, and had a famously well orchestrated character arc where we observed an aimless troubled boy develop into an honest, goal-driven man with a burning passion for professional boxing. Even if Makunouchi Ippo is even to this day a pansy (at least outside of the ring), he leads an inspirational story of a bullied nerd who through sheer dedication and perseverance works his way to the top of Japan\u2019s boxing ladder. Both of these characters received at least one hundred episodes of development, whereas Joe receives only thirteen. We don\u2019t learn anything about his past. We don\u2019t learn makes him tick as a person. We don\u2019t learn his greatest fears. His character is as deep as a puddle in the Sahara desert, and it is especially in comparison to his predecessors that he pales in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not even sure how many viewers are aware of Yabuki Joe's story. I\u2019d wager less than 20% of the (Western) audience for Megalo Box have seen Ashita no Joe, let alone have finished it, which would explain all of the acclaim this anime is receiving even despite it's glaring flaws and stale as cardboard lead character who could only dream of being a successor to Yabuki Joe. I find it hard to imagine a viewer of Ashita no Joe watching this and walking away impressed, but there is at least one niche interest available to such fans in the many cross references and homages. From Sachio wearing Yabuki Joe's signature flat cap, to familiar character designs and reimagined scenes being taken directly from the original series, where Megalo Box fails to be a tribute in terms of writing and dramatic tension, it at least succeeds in paying open respect to the original series.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the above criticisms are meant to suggest that a viewer is wrong for liking Megalo Box when it does have an abundance of surface level appeal. Maybe you value tone more so than writing in media, in which case no one should be able to convince you to think otherwise. However, exceeding in one area doesn't excuse utter failure in others that are critical to the very essence of a story itself. Megalo Box is a DIRECT tribute to what I would consider to be the greatest hand to hand combat narrative in anime history. For it to have subpar fight animation and forgettable characters is a major disappointment no matter how you slice it. The only way it tries to distinguish itself from the original series is by introducing a plot device that proves itself to be totally useless, because power doesn't mean jack shit unless you can hit a moving target. Megalo Box is a decent anime for what it is - a nostalgic, short celebration of Ashita no Joe's 50th anniversary, and is not a worthy successor to the combat sport anime that came before it as is being hailed by critics universally.",

            "content": "A project commemorating the 50th anniversary of the legendary boxing manga, Ashita no Joe\u2014Megalo Box is remarkably cinematic very much cut in the mould of retro anime from vintage Madhouse and Gainax. What exactly makes this diamond in the rough shine the way it has? What has allowed it to shine in an era where it had every reason to be overlooked? It\u2019s a simple answer and its nostalgia. This is like Hajime no Ippo with Sci-Fi elements being directed by Watanabe Shinichirou and Nujabes on the beat. For a spinoff series, it's surprisingly free of the burdens of being part of a legendary franchise.Its 13 episodes long but makes every second count, it has a good pacing that builds up momentum all the way to the finale.\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where underground boxing has boxers wearing gear to enhance their fighting skills, Megalo Box follows a nameless wanderer in \u201cJunk Dog,\u201d (who later becomes known as \u201cJoe,\u201d) as he is used as a tool to throw matches for cash. Determined that he has what it takes to take down the champion at this year's Megalonia, he throws his past to the side and decides to fight fearlessly to the top of the rankings. He crosses paths with people who help him on his journey as well as people who attempt to sabotage his rise. Along with some surprisingly emotional episodes involving characters from the past, this show takes your heartstrings and tugs on them pretty hard on multiple occasions. While the overall series is slightly predictable in terms of where the story progresses, the point is that it keeps you emotionally invested. Whether it\u2019s simply an episode of characters reflecting on the past or literally fighting in the ring, everyone gets his shot at a development and are fleshed out. It\u2019s almost as if the core story of fighting to the top takes a backseat and places itself on autopilot at times, as the story takes you on separate journeys into the past or future. Just when you know you have everything figured out, Megalo Box either gives you a helluva of a fight or has you begging for certain characters fates.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Joe was lost and didn\u2019t know his place in the world. He was a drifter, going along with the flow. A man from the slums who has no identity either than the moniker, \"Junk Dog\". After a confrontation with his destined rival, Yuuri, who happens to be the current Megalo Boxing champion, a burning desire was lit inside Joe to prove to everyone including himself that he can make it to the top and become champion by beating Yuuri. Both are polar opposites. Joe is brash, na\u00efve and wears his heart on his sleeve. Yuuri is cool, calm and collected. Joe is from poverty while Yuuri is wealthy. Joe starts taking control of his own destiny rather than leaving it in the hands of his manager Nanbu who had Joe throw fights in the underground circuit to earn a living. Yuuri still takes demands from his manager Yukiko who is running the Megalonia. Both characters are charismatic and ooze confidence. Nanbu eventually gives up his con past and becomes Joe\u2019s trainer and helps him get the requirements to enter ranks. Along their way they find Sachio who turns out to be a tech genius who knows about the gears, he uses his skills to help work his way into Joe\u2019s corner. Both Nanbu and Sachio have ulterior motives for joining Joe\u2019s journey and their reasons for it is very interesting. There is just a lot of chemistry and charm with the characters and there are layers to their relationships.\\n\\n\r\nTMS Entertainment name doesn\u2019t pop up much when elite anime studios are being discussed. But they\u2019re seriously making their case as far as I\u2019m concerned, not just because of quality but stylistic diversity. TMS Entertainment has never done anything quite like Megalo Box. There hasn't been much anime that try to capture an old-school mystique, and many specifically a Gainax mystique. Some even partially succeed. But Megalo Box gets a bigger piece of that pie than almost any show that I can think of. There\u2019s no credibility gap here because every aspect of this production reeks of authenticity. Ashita no Joe wasn\u2019t a Gainax series, and Megalo Box does feel faithful to it, but I just see that imprint all over it. The way it embraces the imperfections of the traditional hand-drawn art is visually nostalgic and beautiful. I\u2019m in awe of the fighting sequences that I felt I had front seats to this spectacle, the animation is superb and what highlights it, even more, is the incorporation of various camera angles, shaky cam effects, the fluidity, the choreography along with well-timed panning and transitions during the action that adds realism to the physicality and pain on display. From the backgrounds, architectures to the colour palette used make it capture the retro feel and aesthetic of a 90\u2019s classic. The visuals as a whole have a graininess that harkens back to how shows looked before the advent of HD resolutions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen an anime soundtrack makes it on Spotify, you know it\u2019s a killer. Megalo Box\u2019s music is like a shoeshine combination that will knock you out and leave you in a state of pure euphoria. To put it quite simply, it\u2019s one of the greatest soundtracks to hit the airwaves in the last decade. It\u2019s Hip-Hop inspired and gives the show a lot of swagger and range. It\u2019s able to elevate the action to the next level, giving you a rush of adrenaline when fights reach its climax. Each track effortlessly compliments the various moods in and outside of the ring. The Opening gets you pumped and the Ending helps you wind down from the hype. The Voice acting is exceptional and is deserving of praise. They are able to make the voice for their character fit with their look, age, masculinity (for the fighters) and personality and make it believable\u2014especially with Joe. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit of everything in Megalo Box for everyone to enjoy. It has charisma, comedy, drama, high stakes, action and other elements that point to a love of the past decade\u2014from the writing and script willing to venture into a dark and gloomy subject matter, as well as a soundtrack that is absolutely amazing with its Hip-Hop style. It all points to a love for a style of animation that the industry has since moved away from. It shows exactly what was so great about anime from the \u201cGolden Era\u201d and makes the case that even if it\u2019s gone, the likes of Megalo Box will make sure it stays far and away from being forgotten. Joe\u2019s rise from a no-name underground boxer to a world-class contender for a world championship title is a tale of the underdog, it\u2019s inspiring, you cannot help but root for his success. Despite having a few hiccups along the way, it goes the distance and after 13 rounds this Cinderella story leaves its mark.\\n",

            "content": "Warning this review contain spoilers for Megalo Box\r\nTribute is a way to celebrate old works, by taking ideas of the thing is was inspire by, try to modernize its theme, and setting. That what Megalo Box is it\u2019s a tribute to manga that was made in 1968 known as Ashita no Joe. For those who have never heard of it, Ashita no Joe was a shounen sports manga that ran in Shounen Magazine Weekly. It spanned for 20 volumes and had 171 chapters, it got an anime adaption in 1970 that ran for 79 episodes, it later got a second season during 1980 and itran for 47 episodes. For the time Ashita no Joe came it out nothing was like it, it was a heave drama show that covers all themes boxing had. It did a lot of things that establish what anime and manga known for, without a lot of your favorites wouldn\u2019t be the same. With that established, going back to the word tribute, Now if a tribute only copies things from it was inspire by does that mean new viewers who never watch Ashita no Joe won\u2019t enjoy this, no it\u2019s possible to enjoy Megalo box with seeing Joe, true you won\u2019t get the references, but you still able to get some level of enjoyment out of it. However, hear the thing about a tribute should do, a tribute needs to separate it self from the thing it\u2019s reference, sure it okay to reference things you are inspire from, but you need to separate yourself from it the inspiration. That what you are looking into with this review and determine if Megalo Box did enough to consider separate series or is still in Ashita no Joe shell? \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the show revolves Junk Dog wanted to see how strong he truly he is, he never been sure, due to the fact he been fighting fix boxing matches, in order to get money, as they are involved with this mafia boss they own a lot of money too. It isn\u2019t until he meets Yuri and Yuri gets curious how strong is Junk Dog, they fight, and Yuri is impressed that he was able to make him use both his hands against him. After Junk Dog lost the match again Yuri, he vows to challenge Yuri once again and show him how strong he can become. He changes his name to Joe to as a reference to Joe Yabuki the main character of Ashita no Joe.  With this you think that their a rivalry going between Joe and Yuri, but that were you wrong, as you loo into the content of their characters, Junk Dog the only one who cares about facing Yuri. Yuri during majority of the shows doesn\u2019t care if he never faces him again, true the strong Joe become the more interest Yuri is, but it isn\u2019t until the days before they have their final match Yuri is interested in facing him. With that we have to give Joe opponents for him to face to reach the right to face Yuri again. With that this show mainly becomes boxing matches of the week, as we keep moving on to the next guy, which hurt the show as this show doesn\u2019t have proper build up to it matches and does spend enough time developing its characters. If was 26 instead of 13 we could have more time between matches, more growth for Joe and Yuri, and the matches could be more intense. That the problem her with it\u2019s matches, sure they are great to look it, but you release majority of the fights fell dull, because they have to hurry up and finish the fight, that way we have time to do JD vs Yuri. Even when we get to the match,  the fight is lackluster, majority of it is finally fight it just Joe taking hits and trying to survive, it isn\u2019t until the last round, he start to fight back and beat Yuri with a Cross Counter, which that a giving as in Ashita no Joe, Joe signature move is the cross counter, so that was bound to be use in Megalo Box somepoint in the series. However even it cool too see as I do love that move, it\u2019s comes off a lame, as if the fight had more episodes to it, the impact of cross counter, cloud have been epic, it could have been awesome, but its\u2019 not. What we are left it an empty final fight, which a shame I wanted the fight to be epic, as Joe Vs Rikishi was, but we didn\u2019t get that. Instead we got a lame fight. Now if you are think even if the fights were rushed and they were at least well animated, and you right they are. The show has a never nice looking retro style that different then what we are used to coming out. We get shows that look not much different from each other, so for a show like Megalo Box to come out in the time it did, felt refreshing, and that what made the popular when it was out. \\n\\n\r\nNow beside the story and animation, what I want to look into before discussion my thoughts on the ending are its characters, and its character with the expect of Nanbo are one note. They stick to what they are establish of begin. Joe is stereotypical badass main character, who try to challenge the use of gears, by going in matches without one, giving him the nick name gearless Joe. Which is a cool name, I got to admit, but I wish he would grow more beside how far he gets rankings. Their nothing much to his character, he doesn\u2019t develop enough, if the show 26 we could have done more to develop him. But with it being 13 episodes we get not much time to develop, as we got to make sure Joe can face Yuri by episode 13. Speaking of Yuri like Joe his character stays the same, he the top guy that no can defeat, he has to the best gear, he has the best promotion, he powerful, he got it all. It isn\u2019t until episode 12 we see something about that change, he decides to let go all things he been giving to him, his gear, his team, he going to face Joe as a one-man team, to show a form of respect to him. I like this, but I wish we got something more. The other characters such as Yukiko, Sachio, Fujimaki and the guys Joe fact, are one note as well, they don\u2019t have anything special to them. Now you nothing I exclude Nanbu right, well the thing about Nanbu he actually gets development. He starts own as your typical teacher, but we get more to his character, we see a guy to go far for to make sure Joe is successful and try to settle the score he has with Fujimaki. Which I like this, and to see how it all end him with losing an eye, was a nice brutal scene, that I was surprise to see get pull of so well. Not jut that, but when Joe was facing his former student, we get a side of Nanbu we didn\u2019t see before. We get a man with a lot of regrets, and he wish the man he trains end better than what he ended up as. I like this it gives him something more than the character he was based off being Danpei. Nanbu is able to separate from the character he was inspired by. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the shows was a disappointment, true it was nice to see Joe win, but I would like Joe and Yuri died in the end. It would have offer a nice tragic conclusion to see these two men fight to the death. But in the end what we got with Joe retiring and Yuri being crippled, which that is rough that man career is over. But it would have been epic to see both of them die with that cross counter, and end of being a draw. With that said there isn\u2019t too much to left say about Megalo Box, it\u2019s a show that stick to the thing that was inspire about by. Which is not good, as a person who know on here as the biggest Ashita no Joe on here, I wanted Megalo Box to separate itself, and I could judge as its own thing, and look back on and say that was the best tribute every made. But we didn\u2019t get that we got a series that stick what it started as and remind the same. Which is a shame, it could have been more, but because of the it being 13 episodes, what we got was anime that always be in Ashita no shell. With that being said I give Megalo Box a 6.5 out of 10. \\n",

            "content": "So...Megalo Box. I have a lot of reservations for it because I really liked the first few episodes but in the end its just disappointing.\r\nI still feel like the entire setting was created just for Megalo Box and the universe outside of it just does not exist and then what Megalovania ends up being has nothing to do with that and...they created everything for something that ended up not mattering.I dont really know what they were going for or what any supposed thematic elements could even be. Class metaphor? Not really. Natural talent vs hard work? Not sure. The pureness of a sport taken awayfrom the roots by companies? The Shirato people are not even a factor to the overall plot of anything. Those things are there but barely, so inconsequential that they feel like accidents and not thesis statements This entire show -the entire idea of the name of the show - exists for Joe and Yuri and they have no passion between them. A good rivalry needs some animus, some driving factor, some similarities, any emotion at all. I don't get that from either of them. I'm still unsure what their actual goals are. Why are they striving so hard for this? What even set Joe off about Yuri in the first place? Do they just want a Goku/Vegeta good-ass fight? Do they want to stare death in the face for the thrill of it? I don't think even the show knows. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending doesn't really settle as anything satisfying for me. I'm not even sure the characters got what they wanted based on what I thought. I feel like the conclusion they reached for the final fight was the right one, but it didn't come about naturally. They skipped too many steps. Megalo Boxing and the Gears never mattered. The idea of boxing but more dangerous didn't matter because Joe could just take any hit.\\n\\n\r\nI still don't know what they were going for with this series. In a season with so many disappointments, this one still manages to stand out as it wasn't like this immediately out the gate, but instead just quickly ran out of energy.",

            "content": "TLDR: \r\nMegalo Box is an incredible watch which sets the stage for you to want to kill for the next episode. It is the epitome of an original action-packed thriller boxing anime and will not disappoint in any major way. If you have the time of your life to lose, Megalo box should be the thief that takes your damned free time.\r\nScores~ Story [8] Art [7] Sound [9] Character [9] Enjoyment [10] Overall [8.6]\r\nStory [8]:\r\nMegalo introduces a new approach to the boxing genre as it incorporates an entirely new mechanic into the physical sport. This mechanic allows the series to pan out quite interestingly asthey find means to overcome entirely different obstacles to win. \\n\r\nAlthough the story doesn't typically allow a typical \"introduction\" to the landscape, we are able to imply various situations with relative ease. This combined with its immersive \"junk rat\" feel Megalo culminates as a completely different and refreshing take on the boxing environment as it drags you into its violent and volatile world.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]\\n\r\nAs this is a remake, it can be understood that the art will look rather dated and this is true here. The art style itself is of a lower resolution than the typical 2018 animes we've seen, but it works out completely in its favour here as it presents an entirely new concept. Due to the setting of the anime, the use of the older art only adds to the scrapyard feel and compliments the plot and setting produced by the studio. Combine with its consistency throughout fight scenes and solid application to characters, we are left with art as its weakest point but in no way, a hindrance. \\n\\n\r\nSound [9]\\n\r\nThe sound is incredible. \\n\r\nIt's perfect timing in the fight scenes. The immersive tracks throughout the series. The appropriately themed OP and ending tracks. It brings the whole work together as a high-quality body of work. Even though the MC can sound like a bore, the studio approaches to every line with proper intentions in mind and add on top of the already immersive tone on the series. TMS Entertainment has done an incredibly good job here making the whole thing work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9]\\n\r\nMegalo Box's characters are enticing and interesting. The studio has allowed each character to carve out their own role within the series, no matter how minor it might be. Served with their own interesting and deep personalities, Megalo Box is a prime example of character and character development done right, as it proceeds to allow the characters free reign upon the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\r\nOh my. \\n\r\nAn action-packed, thrilling fighting anime that includes an incredibly interesting MC that strays from the \"I'm weak help me\" archetype basically describes what I'm seeing. I love it, to every part. The immersion that the studio has allowed Megalo to project. The consideration of every single character displayed within the series. The studio has respected this remake, reimagined it and added a little extra. This is one of the most enjoyable and memorable watches I have ever lied my eyes on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall [8.6]\\n\r\nMegalo Box is the prime example of a boxing anime done right and doesn't seem to falter in any major aspect. The studio has respected the identity and world within the series and amplified its effect as they noticeably put every ounce of their being into this anime. \\n\r\nIf you haven't touched this anime, I recommend you do so and come with rather high expectations because after its all said and done,\\n\\n\r\nIt has and will deliver. \\n\\n\r\nSo go to where you watch anime and watch it now. It has and will be an experience to remember.\\n",

            "content": "Megalo Box started off as a really cool anime. The most noticeable thing to anyone at first glance is the art, which if I remember correctly was just the art being down-scaled and then up-scaled to give it the aesthetic it has. Don't quote me on that. Either way, the artstyle was interesting and the idea of a 50th anniversary project for Ashita no Joe sounded interesting. So why did it end up like it did? There'll be spoilers, btw.\r\nThe first few episodes were great, personally. The soundtrack alongside the art made the first few episodes seem badass and hype, and I was really rootingfor Joe to win his goal of...not losing matches I guess? I mean, the main \"story\" doesn't start until a few episodes in, but even by then you're already given several good setups at least.\\n\\n\r\n-The protagonist, Joe, who is an underdog type character without too much unique to his personality. He's cool and all at least, enough to get you rooting for him if nothing else. Plus he rides a motorcycle 3 or 4 times.\\n\r\n- An antagonist, Yuri, who doesn't actually seem like a generic douchebag but an actual person who respects the sport and the fighters, and is rather likable as far as antagonists go, even by the end.\\n\r\n-An idea of what exactly Megalo-boxing is and on what scale of appeal the sport is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's enough of a setup within the first few episodes to give a sports anime a nice start, a promising start. I sure thought so, at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe show was pretty good up until the main story started, whatever episode that was. I don't think I'm in the minority opinion for that statement seeing as how the MAL score around that time started slowly going down from a mid-8.4 to what it is now. The problem that starts around this time is the problem that the show inevitably ends with: predictability.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a sports anime, you're kind of expected from the get-go to assume the protagonist will win a lot of the time and be all badass and stuff. But Megalo Box doesn't even try to be subtle about it. Every match is the same thing over and over again. You're given an \"antagonist\" for that match who gets some semi-interesting backstory and maybe some relevancy to other characters, and then they get in the ring with Joe and they both have at each other. Joe gets the absolute crap beat out of him for several minutes, while Sachiko (an annoying and 100% useless kid who does a really cringey rap in one of the last few episodes) and Nanbu (a generic coach) yell at him to do this and that and not give up. Then, through the power of absolutely nothing, Joe is able to K.O. the opponent in one hit, ending the match with a win for him. I never mentioned this, but Joe is \"gearless\" during all of these fights meaning that basically he doesn't have these boxing-aid-machines on his arms. Logically, he should lose all his battles against his opponents who DO all have gear, since they literally have machines on their arms whereas Joe has his arms bare, however, he never loses. This means that Joe is literally the most overpowered character in this show, because not once does he get KO'd even though by all means he should, especially when you see how badly his ass gets beat in the ring. Each match starts and ends the same way, with a lot of flashbacks and other things going on being thrown into the fray WHILE the matches are going on, which often times messes with the momentum of the fights. Most of that stuff could've been mentioned before the fights at least, then I'd at least go into each fight with a good understanding of the opponent, regardless of how generic their backstory is.\\n\r\nThat doesn't happen, of course. The fights are pretty cool though, and well choreographed imo.\\n\\n\r\nAsides from the matches being done in such a bad way (asides from the actual fighting, for the most part), the main story is also really lame. A woman, who also could be considered an antagonist of sorts, is basically the founder of megalo-boxing as we see it and hosts the competition for which everything takes place. I think what her goal was was to show-off how interesting megalo-boxing was and how viable it is as a military weapon. At least, that's what I could remember from the ending. Frankly, whenever the fights weren't happening I found myself bored a lot of the time, which is another point to bring up. Sure the music's good and the art is unique, but the characters either have no depth or are straight-up bad. Why should I care about the story anyways? I already know Joe is going to win all the matches just because he can, why not just skip to the fights? I mean, they show the meat of who the opponents Joe face are mid-fighting, so it's not like I have to spend the other 15 minutes getting to know who they are and whatever the hell else is going on. The only character I can say was genuinely interesting was Yuri, although he reminds me too much of the one character from Ping Pong to say he's original. On the other hand, there's some story going on with Nanbu and some loanshark type guy who's just an asshole but is also kind of cool. Nanbu has to have Joe win the Megalo Box tournament at first so that the mean man can make money, then he has to lose it so the mean man can make money. It's probably the most interesting thing going on story-wise but that isn't saying a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nSo all-in-all, you've got a run-of-the-mill nothing story, several obnoxious/shallow/boring characters, and fights that are as predictable as they come. Frankly, I can't say there's much reason to watch this show asides from the artstyle and soundtrack. If you strip those two things away this show has nothing else going for it really. That's not to say you SHOULDN'T watch it, that's your choice obviously and there's some pretty cool stuff that happens in the show every so often, but there's nothing to gain from watching it. No messages besides generic underdog stuff and blah blah blah watch Rocky instead if you want something more interesting that's also boxing related (can't comment on Ippo or Ashita no Joe, so). Frankly this show is just disappointing and has nothing worthwhile in any of the major departments. Can't really recommend it for anyone who wants a sports anime with substance as I can with, say, Ping Pong. Give that a watch instead, there's a good chance it'll be more of an experience than this show would be.\\n",

Reel Steel meets Hajime No Ippo!\r\nMegalo isn't mega-awesome in any facet of the game, but it does provide enough entertainment for me to consider it a good show.  Our protagonist is similar to any deadbeat, wannabe protagonist in the history of anime except for the fact that he has cool scars and rides a motorcycle to get his mind off of spicy tentacle porn.  \r\n\"Joe\" is tired of being a boxer who has real potential, yet continues to throw it all away by partaking in fixed fights within the undergroundboxing circuit.  But hey, it's the only thing he can do for actual money, right?\\n\\n\r\nWrong! Megalonia comes along and that changes everything.  It's a special tournament for ultra rich boxers who have access to enhanced gear, which technically would help a boxer kill a person instantaneously upon impact, but not Joe! He's immune to punches, injuries and surgeries.  And thus our story begins, Joe goes on a journey with: a shady boxing manager, an orphan kid who has sickle cell anemia, and a champion who is into beastiality with huskies (two truths and one lie).  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts off fresh and intriguing but quickly loses steam and turns into your predictable, everyday fighting anime.  By the end of it all, I'm asking myself why the hell did Megalonia sanction a quadriplegic war vet with massive PTSD to fight in a boxing ring where men beat each other with gigantic robot arms? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's good but it's definitely not great.  The moral of the story is...  don't trust scorpions! FUCK FROGS!! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a bilingual review about my experience with Megalobox, I haven't seen Ashita no Joe which is what this series is giving tribute to, but that's not the real point of my review, this is probably the best candidate to anime of the year that I ever seen so far and you are gonna see why.\r\nLa rese\u00f1a est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol, ve un poco m\u00e1s abajo para leerla.\r\nEnglish:\r\nMegalobox is one of those animes that are not seen very often in the modern anime, we can not always see a protagonist with an underdog style who has to beat people in street fights to survive throughpoverty, the style of the series is something that I love and really don't understand why many people complain about the quality of the animation, this gives a pretty cool retro style, and not only there are people complaining about this, but several  people see the wrong side of the premise and they think that Gears are something unnecessary and I will tell you why all these points are wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI was also confused at the beginning, what is the point of using a mechanism that increases your strength? Why don't they do normal boxing? This is something that in the first 3 episodes of the series clarify quite noticeably, when Joe is watching television in the first scene, the series itself questions the existence of Gear technology, which they respond that it is a good for the society and that is a way to maintain a balance, also, later they say that Megalobox does not discriminate and anyone can enter the tournament regardless of their age or physical condition.\\n\r\nAnd it's here when the series shows us that none of these facts are like that, when Joe tells Yuuri (in the first episode) \"show me your real Megalobox\" it's because boxing is not just marketing, it's about feeling adrenaline and try to outdo yourself and feel the glory of winning, and these are values \u200b\u200bthat in the society of the series have been lost, the existence of the gears is not only to make the fights interesting, it is a reflection that boxing it's not always about doing something you like, it's a business, a way to over-exploit people's pockets by encouraging them to enter a tournament in which if you're not a millionaire who can buy a powerful Gear, you can never win.\\n\r\nAnd this is not something that simply happens in the series, a fairly easy example of this are video games and micro transactions, you can not enjoy something you like without investing some money to gain an advantage within it (of course, in this case there are exceptions), the same happens with the world of music, not only you must invest in instruments, you must invest in advertising and a manager to make yourself known and even so, you may still fail, be betrayed and all your money will end up wasted.\\n\r\nJoe is aware of all this and wants to show the world that sports is something that we are all capable of enjoying and that social inequality should not be something that keeps us from doing what we like the most.\\n\r\nMany people do not realize the message of the series, because generally one is focused on the protagonist and the dialogues instead of looking at the surroundings, and the series doesn't directly say you all of this, you have to figure it out through all the clues in the scenarios, and little details that tells you the meaning of this anime. This is not a problem of the direction, because it's a fantastic way to show the premise without wasting time with dialogues as a way to explain the plot of the series but I have to say, being a 12 episode series about boxing is a really bad combination which proves why Hashime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe are better than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters, starting with Joe, the protagonist, as I mentioned before, he's the type of person who trusts his ideals and has an instinct of justice for helping others, even though his thoughts go hand in hand with the philosophy of the series, he has no credible reason why he feels passion for boxing, at first we see that he only fights to survive and gain his paycheck, later we see what motivates him to enter the Megalobox tournament, but we never know why he likes boxing in the first place and we don't know about his past either, so the spectator usually does not identify much with the character beyond his goals. Throughout the series he really improves his way of fighting and has a great development of his way of thinking and personality but usually he makes the same mistakes sometimes despite the fact that Nanbu and Sachio remind him of those mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nNanbu Gansaku on the other hand has a consistent character development, at first we see him as a bastard who only wants to make money without caring about others, however during the series we see how his connection with Joe becomes stronger when they both try to reach to the top, and also the series shows us his reasons why he initially has this behavior with Joe through his past, so certainly, this is the best character in the whole series despite of him being a plot device in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nSachio is a boy who is introduced in the third episode, his role is similar to  Nanbu's which is to support Joe and help him train, he also has a great passion for the Megalobox and his motivations, although they are not too deep, they are understandable enough to ignore his very empty introduction. Beyond this, it is a simple character that serves to show a couple of references to Ashita no Joe and nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri is the main antagonist of the series, I would say that he is in the same situation as Joe, we don't know his past nor his real motives for being the champion of Megalobox, however his personality reflects several themes that the series touches. In addition to those already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Yuuri experiments the emptiness of always winning and understanding more what boxing truly means, this is indeed a good development of his personality, mainly because of meeting Joe in the first episode. I don't have much more to add about him.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go into my favorite territory of the series which is the soundtrack, saying that it's great it's not enough, the hip hop songs combining it with the scenes showing the city and the well detailed streets is such a great combination to help the viewer immerse itself into the urban atmosphere. And the hard rock of the opening is something wonderful showing how MANLY the series is, the ending and its lyrics reflect very well the emotions of the characters besides that it has a pretty catchy rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation along with the direction is very beautiful and the retro style that this has combined with the handmade animation makes it very attractive and enjoyable to look at, often the show has small quality downgrades but fortunately this doesn't happen in the fight scenes so that's tolerable, the shots of the scenarios are very detailed and quite realistic, there is not much more to say, just great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm very sorry if there's grammar errors, english is not my native language I would highly appreciate suggestions and criticism to help me improve, thank you so much for reading ;)\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol:\\n\r\nMegalobox es de esos animes que ya no se ven muy a menudo en el anime moderno, no siempre podemos ver a un protagonista con un estilo de lobo solitario que tiene que darse de golpizas en peleas callejeras para sobrevivir en la pobreza, su estilo es algo que me encanta y realmente no entiendo por qu\u00e9 mucha gente se queja de la calidad de animaci\u00f3n, siendo \u00e9sta algo que le da ese toque retro y genial a la serie, y no solo hay gente quej\u00e1ndose de \u00e9sto, sino que varios ven la premisa de utilizar gears como algo innecesario y les dir\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 todos estos puntos son err\u00f3neos.\\n\\n\r\nPara empezar, la trama es algo que a mi tambi\u00e9n me tuvo confuso al principio, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el punto de utilizar un mecanismo que incrementa tu fuerza? \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no hacen boxeo normal? Esto es algo que los primeros 3 episodios de la serie aclaran de forma bastante notoria, cuando Joe est\u00e1 viendo la televisi\u00f3n en la primera escena, la serie misma se cuestiona la existencia de la tecnolog\u00eda Gear, a la cu\u00e1l responden que es un bien para la sociedad y que es una manera de mantener un equilibrio, tambi\u00e9n m\u00e1s adelante dicen que Megalobox no discrimina y cualquiera puede entrar en el torneo sin importar su edad o condici\u00f3n f\u00edsica.\\n\r\nY es ac\u00e1 cuando la serie nos muestra que ninguno de \u00e9stos hechos son as\u00ed, cuando Joe le dice a Yuri (en el primer episodio) \"mu\u00e9strame tu verdadero Megalobox\" es debido a que el boxeo no es simplemente marketing, se trata de sentir adrenalina, intentar superarte a ti mismo y sentir la gloria de ganar, y estos son valores que en la sociedad de la serie se han perdido, la existencia de los gears no solo es para hacer las peleas interesantes, es un reflejo de que el deporte no siempre se trata de hacer algo que te guste, es un negocio, una forma para sobre explotar el bolsillo de la gente incit\u00e1ndolos a entrar en un torneo en el que si no eres un millonario que pueda comprarse un Gear potente, nunca podr\u00e1s ganar.\\n\r\nY esto no es algo que simplemente ocurre en la serie, un ejemplo bastante f\u00e1cil de esto son los videojuegos y las micro transacciones, no puedes disfrutar de algo que te guste sin invertir algo de dinero para ganar una ventaja dentro de \u00e9ste (obviamente existen excepciones para este caso); lo mismo pasa con el mundo de la m\u00fasica, no s\u00f3lo se debe invertir en instrumentos, debes invertir en publicidad y manager para hacerte conocer e incluso as\u00ed, es posible que seas traicionado y fracases rotundamente. \\n\r\nJoe es consciente de todo esto y quiere demostrarle al mundo que el deporte es algo que todos somos capaces de disfrutar y que la desigualdad social no debe ser algo que nos retenga de hacer lo que m\u00e1s nos guste.\\n\r\nMucha gente no se da cuenta del mensaje de la serie, debido a que generalmente uno est\u00e1 enfocado en el protagonista y los di\u00e1logos en vez de mirar a los alrededores y la serie no te dice todo esto directamente, debes averiguarlo a trav\u00e9s de todas las pistas en los escenarios, y peque\u00f1os detalles que te dicen el significado de este anime. Esto no es un problema de la direcci\u00f3n, ya que veo como una forma fant\u00e1stica de mostrar la premisa sin perder el tiempo con di\u00e1logos como una forma de exposici\u00f3n para explicar la trama de la serie, pero tengo que decir que ser una serie de 12 episodios sobre el boxeo es una combinaci\u00f3n realmente mala y es por eso que Hajime no Ippo y Ashita no Joe son mejores que esto.\\n\\n\r\nAhora hablemos de los personajes, empezando por Joe, el protagonista, como he mencionado antes, es un tipo de persona que cree mucho en sus ideales y posee un instinto de justicia por ayudar a los dem\u00e1s, sin embargo a pesar de que sus pensamientos vayan de la mano con la filosof\u00eda de la serie, no posee un motivo cre\u00edble por el cual \u00e9ste siente pasi\u00f3n por el boxeo, al principio lo vemos que s\u00f3lo pelea para ganarse el pan y sobrevivir en la pobreza, y luego vemos lo que lo motiva a querer entrar al Megalobox, pero nunca sabemos por qu\u00e9 le gusta el boxeo en primer lugar y tampoco conocemos su pasado, por lo que el espectador por lo general no suele identificarse mucho con el personaje m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus objetivos, posee un buen desarrollo siendo alguien que solo le gusta pelear, mejorando su estilo de pelea y aprendiendo de sus oponentes, aunque suele cometer los mismos errores repetidas veces a pesar de que Nanbu y Sachio se lo recuerden.\\n\\n\r\nNanbu Gansaku por otro lado s\u00ed tiene un desarrollo consistente de personaje, al principio lo vemos como un bastardo que solo quiere hacer dinero sin importarle los dem\u00e1s, sin embargo durante la serie vemos como su conexi\u00f3n con Joe cada vez se hace mas fuerte cuando ambos intentan llegar a la cima, y tambi\u00e9n la serie nos muestra sus motivos por el cual \u00e9ste al principio tiene \u00e9ste comportamiento inicial a trav\u00e9s de su pasado, por lo que ciertamente, este es el mejor personaje de toda la serie que no es un simple plot device, si bien es alguien que contribuye a que la trama avance para que Joe consiga entrar al Megalobox, es un personaje bastante completo.\\n\\n\r\nSachio es un ni\u00f1o que es introducido en el tercer episodio, su funci\u00f3n es similar a la de Nanbu la cual es brindarle apoyo a Joe y ayudarlo a entrenar, tambi\u00e9n posee una gran pasi\u00f3n por el Megalobox y sus motivaciones aunque no son profundizadas demasiado, son lo suficientemente entendibles como para que pase por alto su muy vac\u00eda introducci\u00f3n. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de esto, es un simple personaje que sirve para mostrar un par de referencias a Ashita no Joe y nada m\u00e1s.\\n\\n\r\nYuuri, el cu\u00e1l es el antagonista principal de la serie, dir\u00eda que est\u00e1 en la misma situaci\u00f3n que Joe, no conocemos su pasado ni tampoco sus motivos reales por el que \u00e9ste sea el campe\u00f3n de Megalobox, sin embargo su personalidad refleja varios temas que toca la serie adem\u00e1s de los ya mencionados al principio de la rese\u00f1a, como el vac\u00edo de ganar siempre y entender m\u00e1s lo que es realmente el boxeo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de un simple deporte que genera ganancias, \u00e9sto es considerado m\u00e1s un desarrollo de personaje ya que es Joe quien lo hace cuestionarse todo esto. No tengo mucho m\u00e1s que a\u00f1adir de \u00e9l.\\n\\n\r\nAhora entremos el mi territorio favorito de la serie el cual es el soundtrack, decir que es genial es quedarse corto, la combinaci\u00f3n de hip hop con las escenas mostrando la ciudad y su pobreza van como anillo al dedo. Y el hard rock del opening es algo maravilloso mostrando lo MANLY que es la serie, el ending y su letra refleja muy bien las emociones de los personajes adem\u00e1s de que posee un ritmo bastante pegadizo.\\n\\n\r\nLa animaci\u00f3n junto con la direcci\u00f3n es muy hermosa y el estilo retro que \u00e9sta posee sumado a la animaci\u00f3n hecha a mano la hace muy atractiva y disfrutable a la vista, suele tener peque\u00f1os bajones de calidad pero por suerte \u00e9sto no sucede en las peleas por lo que es tolerable, los planos de los escenarios por estar hecho a mano son muy detallados y bastante realistas, no hay mucho m\u00e1s que decir, simplemente genial. \\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 7/10\\n\r\nArte: 9/10\\n\r\nSonido: 9/10\\n\r\nPersonajes: 6/10\\n\r\nDisfrute: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNota final: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCualquier sugerencia o critica mientras sea bien fundamentada es bienvenida, muchas gracias por haber le\u00eddo mi segunda rese\u00f1a ;)",

It is in honor of the 50th anniversary of Ashita no Joe. Megalo box starts off in the slums of what looks like a steampunk futuristic city, where \"Junk Dog\" or our no name hero lives. Throwing fights for a living, he has long desired to enter the pro boxing tournament that is \"Megalonia\". One day while he is lost in thought on his motorcyle he has a chance encounter with the Champion Yuri. Later He fightsYuri but is shown the true difference in their powers, thus he must climb the ladder to the top of Megalonia where Yuri waits. I cannot emphasize enough how good the character building of this short series has been so far. The soundtrack is beautiful and fits the whole hood theme of the show. Not only an underdog story, but a true underdog anime that blew my expectations away. \\n\r\nCertainly my favorite anime this season. Go check out Megalo Box!\\n",

            "content": "**spoilers**\r\nMegalo Box is a somewhat formulaic anime that does a great job of pumping you up at certain points in the 13-episode streak, and had some very intense fight scenes that didn't rely on shiny lights and superpowers. Having said that, I feel that the show peaked halfway through and didn't really \"knock me out\" with the ending. The final moments of the show felt a bit rushed, as if I were watching some sort of abridged version, and honestly didn't really feel as satisfying as it should have for some reason. There was something about they way they handled Yuri and the final fightthat left a bad taste in my mouth, although I appreciated that they threw a curveball with the \"meat versus meat\" finale.\\n\\n\r\nLike mentioned earlier, it's a relatively formulaic anime that closely follows the stereotypical boxing movie arc (think \"Rocky Balboa\"), even complete with an stone-cold Russian guy as the final boss. I'm not necessarily hating on shows that follow a formula, but they have to offer something unique and different to really impress. Megalo Box had some really good moments, but they weren't central to the story and hence never spawned into interesting subplots. The show stuck to the formula pretty closely.\\n\\n\r\nSo because of that, I guess I would say that there were very few risks taken with this anime as a whole. The writers do a good job of throwing a lot of \"oh crap\" moments that threaten Joe's ascent to the championship outside of the ring, but there's always a Deus Ex Machina moment to get the sequence of fights back on track. And when all else fails, the writers can always fall back to Joe's complete inability to get knocked out... like ever.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Joe, unless I'm forgetting something we don't ever find out who Joe really is or why he even cares about boxing all that much. He just happens to have an extreme amount of natural talent for it, an extreme desire to become the champion, and the aforementioned invulnerability to knockouts.\\n\\n\r\nIt just didn't feel very realistic that this guy can get beaten down by jacked cyborgs every episode and be strong and lucky enough to knock them out with a single counterpunch. And no, a scene of him riding a motorcycle in a desert is not enough to explain the apparent invincibility. There's a difference between having tough characters and lackluster writing. Why can Joe take 20 hits while his extremely tough and well-trained opponents can only take 3 or so? What was the point of even including the mechanical enhancements to the fighters if they seem just as strong without them? Was it just me or did it feel ridiculous that the announcer said that Yuri was \"stronger than ever\" a week after undergoing a body-mutilating surgery to take off his ultra high-tech, godlike strength enhancing equipment? I don't expect anime to be all that realistic, but the disbelief factor became too extreme to ignore at some points.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to say it, but none of the other characters really stuck out to me. The veteran coach, the hopeful slum kid, the stone-cold russian opponent, the sadistic crime lord, and the corporate lady were all archetypes of characters that have appeared in countless other movies and shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were gritty, and there seemed to be a little hip hop in there which I had mixed feelings about. I really enjoyed some of the post apocalyptic landscapes, and the animation in the boxing ring, but as a whole the visuals and sound didn't particularly stand out to me. Some people are crazy about the soundtrack, I personally would have preferred if they went a totally different route. To each their own.\\n\\n\r\nI rated enjoyment as the highest category here, because I think the show was quite addicting to me while I binged it. I think we all knew the outcome from the start, but I was really eager to see what the next knockout would look like, and how many times Joe would have to get beaten to the ground to climb up the ranks. There was definitely an addiction pushing me to complete the series once I started, but the actual content of the show just wasn't enough to create a fully satisfying and memorable experience in my books. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 -- Good show that is definitely worth watching if you want to see some fights in the ring. You will root for Joe just like you'd root for your favorite sports team in a high-stakes game, but Megalo Box is not something that I'll think about years down the road.",

            "content": "Are you thinking of watching Megalo Box after seeing the high ratings and all the hype? Think again. This is not going to exceed or even reach any expectation. Unless you're an older anime viewer who's watched Cowboy Bebop and can be easily mind-tricked into believing this is an estimable production almost solely because of the not-so-subtle nod Megalo Box gives towards Cowboy Bebop. \r\nSo, I am an older anime viewer and I watched and loved Cowboy Bebop as a child. Also since I kickbox, Megalo box centering around boxing interested me as well--I thought I would be able to relate more and even getideas for new combinations. When I saw the ratings and how highly everyone was praising it, I thought for sure this would be a decent watch. I'm about 5 episodes in (almost halfway) and nothing remotely interesting has happened and there is a high change I will not finish this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box is about an underdog that is seriously underprivileged in life... doesn't even have a name or citizenship apparently, but has the skills to fight boxers that use machinery to add to their strength while he opts to fight bare. So basically, it's like everyone you're fighting uses steroids, but you decide to not use steroids but somehow manage to be more resilient and stronger than others because of your.....technique. Ok. Fine. Maybe I would accept that if the fight scenes were better choreographed to at least give some credence for the necessary suspension of disbelief needed to buy into this plot point. Maybe even cool training scenes. But no, none of that. Nothing at all really. Just.....his perseverance and I guess also the weird kid who someone aids his boxing and makes him a stronger opponent, but not quite sure how. There's also his coach who also lives in the slums with him and continuously discourages him from doing better, but is simultaneously an amazing coach to give him the direction and teachings to help him be so good that he can best opponents without machinery. \\n\\n\r\nThere's just really nothing at all interesting about this show except for the superficial connection to Cowboy Bebop. I honestly believe this is the sole reason why people are hyping this show so much, because they want to believe it is similar to Bebop, when it is by far nothing like the revered cult classic. On Crunchyroll, the comments on the videos are always trying to draw far-fetched similarities between Cowboy Bebop & Megalo Box. But they are not entirely wrong--I noticed some analogous aspects as well such as the main character's design and personality. He really reminded me of Spike with the hair and cool attitude. Not only is the main character's design reminiscent of Spike, his trainer is eerily similar to Jet. And they even had a stupid blue butterfly fluttering around in the show similar to the images that would flash through Spike's mind in Bebop. Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I watched as a kid so it's near and dear to my heart. But that's what makes me even more annoyed about that show because it seems like a marketing ploy to get that exact kind of viewer to tune in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is highly disappointing and I don't even know if I will take the time to finish it. I would not recommend as it's incredibly boring and utterly lacking in uniqueness.",

            "content": "Finishing Megalo Box was a strange experience for me. I felt adequately satisfied, but looking back on the series as a whole, that feels like a weird thing to say for something that, on paper, is kind of a disappointment.\r\nI started watching the series with a lot of anticipation; I\u2019d never read Ashita no Joe, a manga that\u2019s highly well-regarded within the hardcore manga community, but the idea of a new series with a gritty, early 2000\u2019s anime aesthetic was highly appealing, especially in our current anime environment where good series still get released, but shows with this particular kind of look are hard tocome by. The first episode had me as excited as seemingly anyone else in the anime community; its impeccable art direction and stellar music, bolstering a well-worn but perfectly acceptable underdog premise, had the makings of a slam dunk landing that had a lot to offer regardless of your experience with the medium. Newer anime fans could enjoy a well-made, lavishly directed show simply on its own merits, while veteran fans could appreciate it as a callback to a cherished bygone era where many encountered the hobby for the first time.\\n\\n\r\nI continued to enjoy the series week to week for the most part, but even around the halfway point I became aware of the fact that there were some serious downsides that were becoming increasingly more obvious as the series went on. They\u2019re the kinds of problems that would never be clear just from the first few episodes, because you can\u2019t expect a show to unload everything all at once. But even as the show concluded, none of them were ever really addressed properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character might be the best place to start. If you\u2019ve been around the block long enough, complaints about the protagonist dragging a series down are nothing new. While this isn\u2019t exclusively a problem with anime, it might be more noticeable here than anywhere else. When compared to the landscape as a whole, it almost feels wrong to complain about Joe. He doesn\u2019t possess the frustrating blandness of many harem-comedy everyleads, nor is he unintentionally unlikable or obnoxious. He doesn\u2019t even really fit into the category of emotionally frail and indecisive main characters that tend to be so divisive, like Evangelion\u2019s Shinji Ikari. If anything, his simple goal and roguish charisma make it so that it\u2019s not difficult to get behind him and he\u2019s never someone who annoys the audience. So then, what\u2019s there to complain about?\\n\\n\r\nTo put it very simply, he\u2019s not really bad, but he feels like he could be and should be so much more. The series establishes his goal of boxing, yes, but it doesn\u2019t ever really explore WHY it is so important to him, how he came to value it, or really anything about his trajectory or personal story in the larger world beyond him being poor and working in seedy underground boxing matches for a living before meeting Nanbu. Even protagonists who are far more grating on a moment-to-moment basis than Joe, like Naruto Uzumaki, usually get this from the first few chapters. It\u2019s one of the most basic and important aspects of properly establishing a character so the audience can be emotionally invested in them, and something most scriptwriting professors drill into you constantly.\\n\\n\r\nThis in and of itself might seem like a strange thing to complain about, but consider that both Nanbu and Sachio both have more detail put into their backstories and have a more compelling reason to be doing what they\u2019re doing in the story, and you can start to see why some people felt unsatisfied with Joe\u2019s character. It wouldn\u2019t have been necessary in a vacuum, but here, it definitely makes him feel a bit incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nJoe\u2019s ultimate rival, Yuri, is slightly more developed in this sense, but still suffers from the same problem. He claims that Shirato took him in when he was nothing and gave him a future, and that's why he's devoted to Yukiko, but this is never really explored in a satisfying way. About the only thing we see of any substance is their first meeting back when Yukiko's grandfather was still alive. It's actually a decent scene that establishes both their characters nicely, but that's about all we really get and it feels terribly insufficient.\\n\\n\r\nThis refusal or inability to properly explore things in-depth is the central weakness of Megalo Box and why it often feels underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nConsider, for a moment, the setting of Megalo Box itself.  Its futuristic cyberpunk setting, with its massive class divide where the poor are not considered real citizens and live in shanty towns while the rich live in futuristic opulence, and boxing has drastically changed with the introduction of advanced prosthetics that make the matches far more deadly. It's interesting and rife with potential. It also ends up feeling like a change for the sake of the reboot having a new gimmick more than anything else, because this is also not something that well-explored either. Like anything else, we get to see a little. The episode with the people latching onto Joe as a symbol, and the rap that came with it, was great. But outside of that, I don\u2019t remember much else. The cybernetic boxing aspect feels even more irrelevant when Joe himself goes Gearless for the vast majority of the show; I understand that there was something of a thematic point to it, along with adding to his underdog status, but the point is, the show isn\u2019t all that great at using the new stuff that differentiates it from Ashita no Joe despite its best efforts. This is another aspect that I noticed which makes the show a bit frustrating: when the show actually delves a bit into the aspects that would make it better and more well-rounded, the material is usually decent or even good, it just doesn\u2019t deliver too much of it to make enough of a difference in the big picture. Personally, the episode with Aragaki remains one of my favorites for its surprisingly realistic depiction of trauma and PTSD that soldiers suffer from.\\n\\n\r\nIf Megalo Box was the kind of show where strong, tightly-directed action scenes were the focus as opposed to an emotional journey or worldbuilding, then all the downsides I\u2019ve described until now wouldn\u2019t be so important. Given that this is a sports anime, you might be forgiven for expecting that to be the case here, but you would unfortunately be mistaken. It\u2019s rather bizarre to say, but the boxing matches in Megalo Box are probably the weakest part of the whole series. It\u2019s not even that the emotional core of a lot of them are bad, but that the direction in all of them is rather flat and uninspired the vast majority of the time. Everything from the sound effects, camera angles, narrative of the match itself, etc feels completely worksmanlike, almost as if the staff didn\u2019t really care much about them either. They consistently fail to be exciting in and of themselves, and mostly serve as a resolution to whatever conflict is going on at the time. This is honestly one of the most disappointing parts of the production overall and one of the other big reasons why this show ends up falling short of what it could be.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that being said, I still don\u2019t feel particularly unsatisfied or depressed with Megalo Box. I was delayed a bit in watching the last few episodes, but when I did I didn\u2019t feel any regret for having picked up the series and given it a go. There are definitely much worse anime out there that you could waste your time on. It\u2019s just that this could have been better, that\u2019s all.\\n",

            "content": "Why you should watch Megalo Box?\r\nStory is Great (9). Unlike today, anime before the age of digital advances put a lot of time in developing a single episode of 20-24 minute show for the audiences and this in turn makes the all the people behind the anime work hard to provide at least the best story that they could ever provide to justify the amount of time and money that is invested in a project. That is why if you are looking for wonderful anime in terms of story and content I would suggest you go back to watching the classics like cowboy bebop, samuraix, detective conan to mention a few. \\n\\n\r\nNow how does this relate to Megalo Box? A lot! To begin with, this is a love letter to one of the most popular stories ever made: Ashita no Joe (Tomorrow's Joe) for its 50th Anniversary. It's a story of a true rise of an underdog from the slums to the peak of the highest pedestal. It does not keep you waiting and throws you to the depths of it's ssemi-dystopian world of underground megalo boxing. It is boxing with the addition of supporting boxing mechanical gears that enhances the boxer's skill, strengths and abilities.\\n\\n\r\nUpon knowing this, you would be immediately pulled by the idea of it and the possibilities that it would bring. But I bet the you would not be able to guess the direction that the story would pull you through once you start watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story kept me guessing on what would happen next or would they be some high end upgrades that the protagonist would be going through. Yes there were tons of upgrades but not in the part that you may interpret it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the stories that I can say I was totally satisfied from how it piqued my interest, how it sustained my interest and how it satisfied me with its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Outstanding (10). Megalo Box's biggest advantages is it's art style or to be more precised, how it imitated an art style. remember how I mentioned Cowboy Bepop? It was because If you have at least watch one of its episode or seen its art, you can directly see where it adapts the art style.\\n\\n\r\nThere are no, flawless lines here or vibrant colors. It stayed away from the flawlessness of anime of today and went to the classic 90's anime look with how it handled color and texture. Even on 1080p you can see the intentional grainy or imperfect lines that creates that character models and I love it!\\n\\n\r\nSound is Very Good (8). Sound is also very good. I would like to commend the ambient music and mood setting chimes and tunes it plays along with the story. It is a major factor of sustaining the moment when I watch Megalo Box. \\n\\n\r\n\"Bite\" by LEO Imai the opening theme of the story is a great tool to setup the hype of the battle that the anime shows all through out the story and it greatly shows the personality of this anime: ruthless. Even if I am not a fan of the type of rock they play in this opening theme, I can truly appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kakatte Koi yo (\u304b\u304b\u3063\u3066\u3053\u3044\u3088)\" by NakamuraEmi its ending theme is just fun for me. It brings me to a bar setting vibe not only with the music but also with the accompanying animation using neon lights. a perfect way to wrap up an episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Outstanding (10). This is where Megalo Box shines as the story is heavily reliant on the characters. All of the characters, knows their roles in the story and they are not pretentious or confused about it.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the underdog protagonist of the story Junkyard Dog to his partner in crime Nanbu up to the end boss of the story Yuri and his manager Yukiko, all of their characters critically weaves the story altogether. \\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are there not only to move the plot forward but to make the mains of the story bloom and shine more as the story progresses in to it's final act. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would greatly recommend Megalo Box to people who are sick of the mainstream approach to anime and wants to go its roots, or for people just love on brilliant story telling. It does not matter if you like boxing or sports genre in general, this anime is definitely for you. So watch it! Better yet... Binge watch its 13 episodes\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I would give Megalo Box 9 gear pieces out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "A tournament or a competition involving a relatively large number of competitors for me is a perfect and good way to build many characters at the same time while having those fights or competitions as a way to tell backstories and motives behind each character. Meet Megalo Box, an anime built around metal exoskeleton boxing tournament that gracefully being an underdog for the season and ended victoriously as one of my version of the best anime of this season.\r\nWhat I think Megalo Box is very good at is how they handled their character. And for me, the gear is playing a huge role in thecharacter building. To tell the depth of the story without spoiling any of the story is proven to be hard, so this is a spoiler alert.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is an unnamed man who called himself as Junk Dog, a stray dog of sorts. He was fighting with a rusty gear in underground fights before finally decided to climb his way towards the Megalonia, Megalo Box highest tournament in the world, because of the champ's challenge towards him. After watching it till the very end, now I have this view of the gears those fighters wear are restraints for each of them. Starting with our main character, Joe, who fights without gear as a symbol of his freedom of choosing his own path. He actually wore them back in one fight when he knew that he actually still being controlled by Fujimaki and left them off after he chose to choose his own path. Then we have Aragaki whose gear is actually his support after losing his feet and it restrained him to fight further against Joe. Mikio who developed his own gear just to surpass his own sister. And of course, the champ himself, who took off his integrated gear as he wanted to fight Joe equally and as a symbol that he is free from the grasp of Shirato to fight on his own behalf. In the very beginning, Joe and Yuri wore their gear as a symbol that they were fighting not for themselves and left them off in the last fight as a symbol that they were free and fighting for their own causes.\\n\\n\r\nAside from story, the art style of this anime is really out of the box. It took their time to actually downsizing the resolution to have this feeling of old anime and I think they deserve a huge kudos for making it that way. But still, I really want to see this anime being \"remastered\" as I want to see how the real resolution look like. The animation is fluid enough to make me believe that it actually perfect before they even did downsizing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the music is so much good. The electronics with hip hop beat and occasional raps are very perfect for this anime's setting itself : a dystopian future with a very huge gap between the rich and the poor. The songs themselves are very enjoyable and intense, a perfect fit for a cardio workout music and of course for a boxing match. To be honest, how the music flows reminded me of Samurai Champloo and that anime have one of the best anime soundtracks of all time. So, huge kudos for mabanua to make this soundtrack brimming with intense pressure and intense coolness. The soundtrack itself is now available in Spotify so you all should listen to them.\\n\\n\r\nDid I have mention that the ending song if this anime is equally perfect? The ending song is very catchy and listening this out in the public would not make you being labelled as a weeb but a cool guy who listen to a very good set of playlist. Trust me. And of course, the ending song is available in Spotify too if you are curious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is the very definition of an underdog anime. It came out of nowhere and suddenly it is brimming with glory and victory over other anime those have more hype than this one. Just like how this anime told us a story of an underdog who rises to the top. Hands down, if you are into fighting and stuff, this anime is the best anime of the season.",

            "content": "-Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. (Review in English and Spanish)\r\nMegalobox is the sports anime of 2018 surely, this presents us with a world located a couple of decades in the future, in which boxing probably suffers even more support than it receives in our world. In this reality boxing has been transformed into something called Megalo Box, thanks to the technology that Shirato has created, the box has evolved due to the incorporation of a kind of exoskeleton known as \"Gear\" which provides its user with greater resistance , strength and performance. Of course, this technology was notonly created for the sport, but it seeks to use this as a kind of springboard to reach the governments and the military.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode shows our protagonist that in principle he received the pseudonym of \"Junk Dog\" as a kind of boxer from the underworld and the bets of illegal fights, along with his coach Nanbu who was in charge of getting and fixing the fights. All this changes when Junk Dog, who later received the name of Joe (Obvious homage to Joe Yabuki of Ashita no Joe) meets Yuuri our rival of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLater and after Joe decided to leave that betting life behind, he and Nambu (especially Nambu) are forced to enter the official Megalo Box, before of course they would have to receive their credentials as legal citizens, forget to mention that the series It also shows us a very large type of dystopia among the poor and rich, being that our protagonist and his coach were not even considered citizens.\\n\\n\r\nThe art or animation of the series personally captivated me from the first minutes of the first episode, it gives you an feeling of a 90's, with the combination of a current one at opportune moments, perhaps the worst slump is felt in chapter 3, since that the first two chapters were very well elaborated in their style, but it felt that low for its third episode, but personally I really enjoy this style of animation, although I must admit that it also had certain flaws in some moments of the fights. I lack more intensity in the blows or movements? although good, in general I enjoy it very much.\\n\\n\r\nHis OST is not perfect, but it's good, I'm not a person who likes the rap genre honestly, but the music in this series is too catchy and movidita, it's really an enjoy watching box scenes with this OST, maybe I should give it an opportunity to rap ...\\n\\n\r\nAs for his OP and ED, I have to say that it cost me the first 4 episodes to take full pleasure in its opening, I feel that it adapts very well to the series, and the representation of Joe as a stray dog \u200b\u200bthat finally meets with a white dog, clear representation of Yuuri is very good ..... and his Ending that more to say, it is super catchy, I think that each chapter I repeated it 3 times.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that the series needed to personal taste, were more chapters, this shows a bit in the development of certain characters, but more than anything in the development of the plot, at times it was felt that Joe \"was advancing very fast\" or was \"invincible\" except for the first encounter with Yuuri, you can notice how in a chapter it goes from being an unknown and in the next turning into a kind of idol, especially for the poorest. Do not misunderstand me the way was well considering that there were only 13 chapters, but with a little more episodes and would have been better and I think the series deserved it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso criticized a little the use of the \"Gears\" the series sold us at the beginning that the Gears empowered their users in many ways and this in boxing was clearly lethal, but then show us how Joe is able to deal with almost all the fights without using a Gear, while their opponents do And what about the supposed superiority or improvement when having a Gear? I can understand it against normal opponents, but with professional fighters that took away a bit of the anime's spectacularity, it seemed like Joe was on another level even without a Gear, I sincerely hoped that at the moment of entering Megalodonia we would see the Joe of the cover of the anime with his Gear ... I understand that that is not original in the quadrilletero, the same Joe mentions something like that, but in the end it's like they sold fight products a bit overrated and not to mention that with these exoskeletons that power in the blows should feel a little more.\\n\\n\r\nThe two paragraphs above are the only thing that I end up missing in the series, but even so I do not end up ruining the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for his characters, I loved Nanbu at the end, a character that showed us a hard facet and a carefree exterior, a little deceitful and that at first did not give you security, but deep down he was perhaps the person who most I was worried about Joe, charismatic, with a great friendship and in the end he made the biggest sacrifice of all, in which I consider him the best chapter of the series far.\\n\\n\r\nSachio does a great job as the piece that ends up joining the team \"No Place\" the most emotional piece in the group and the glue (with a remarkable rap in the last chapters by the way)\\n\\n\r\nYuuri a good opponent, with an unexpected turn or decision at the end, his appearance in the first chapter gave me epicity accompanied by his great theme, Fujimaki is the character that actually has the role of antagonist of the series, putting the protagonists in much risk of life even, a mafioso that fulfills very well as a character, although him lacked that him received his deserved, but neither does it happen in the real world\\n\\n\r\nYukiko a woman who that hides in a cold appearance and greatness, but as we were shown in several chapters that is far from true and finally Joe is the best protagonist of his season to personal taste, his personality can not be called more how cool, his perseverance and his ability not to give up, I emphasize his voice actor, it fits like a glove ... this character together with Yuuri invite you to climb into a ring and fight like men.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Megalo Box is undoubtedly one of the best sports animes of recent years even with its failures and one of the best animes of this year without a doubt, it turned out to be a worthy tribute to the mythical series Ashita no Joe, a fan of the boxing or the sport can not be missed this anime, is it necessary perhaps more animes like that? would give the existence of two other series that I followed at the same time, so that this would have had 25 chapters, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Rating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------Espa\u00f1ol/Spanish--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMegalobox es el anime de deporte del a\u00f1o 2018 seguramente, este nos presenta un mundo ubicado un par de d\u00e9cadas en el futuro, en el cual el boxeo probablemente sufre aun de mas apoyo del que recibe en nuestro mundo. En esta realidad el boxeo se ha transformado en algo llamado Megalo Box, gracias a la tecnolog\u00eda que ha creado Shirato el box se ha evolucionado debido a la incorporaci\u00f3n de una especie de exoesqueleto conocido como \"Gear\" el cual provee a su usuario de mayor resistencia, fuerza y rendimiento. Por supuesto, esta tecnolog\u00eda no solo fue creada para el deporte, si no que busca usar esto como una especie de trampol\u00edn para llegar hasta los gobiernos y lo militar.\\n\\n\r\nEl primer episodio nos muestra a nuestro protagonista que en principio recib\u00eda el seud\u00f3nimo de \"Junk Dog\" como una especie de boxeador de los bajos mundos y de las apuestas de peleas ilegales, junto a su entrenador Nanbu el cual era el encargado de conseguir y arreglar las peleas. Todo esto cambia cuando Junk Dog, que posteriormente recibir\u00eda el nombre de Joe (Obvio homenaje a Joe Yabuki de Ashita no Joe) se encuentra con Yuuri nuestro rival de la serie.\\n\\n\r\nPosteriormente y luego de que Joe decidiera dejar esa vida de apuestas atr\u00e1s, el y Nambu (por sobre todo Nambu) se ven obligados a entrar al Megalo Box oficial, antes por supuesto tendr\u00edan que recibir sus credenciales de ciudadanos legales, olvide mencionar que la serie tambi\u00e9n nos muestra un tipo de distopia muy grande entre los pobres y ricos, siendo que nuestro protagonista y su entrenador, no eran ni considerados ciudadanos.\\n\\n\r\nEl arte o animaci\u00f3n de la serie personalmente me encanto desde los primeros minutos del primer episodio, te da una sensaci\u00f3n de anime un poco noventero, con la combinaci\u00f3n de uno actual en momentos oportunos, quiz\u00e1s el peor baj\u00f3n se siente en el capitulo 3, ya que los dos primeros cap\u00edtulos fueron muy bien elaborados en su estilo, pero se sinti\u00f3 ese baj\u00f3n para su tercer episodio, pero personalmente disfruto mucho de este estilo de animaci\u00f3n, aunque he de admitir que tambi\u00e9n tuvo ciertas fallas en algunos momentos de las peleas \u00bfQuiz\u00e1s le falto mas intensidad en los golpes o movimientos? aunque bueno, en general lo disfrute mucho.\\n\\n\r\nSu OST no es perfecta, pero es buena, no soy una persona que le guste el genero del rap sinceramente, pero la m\u00fasica de esta serie es demasiado pegadiza y movidita, realmente es un disfrute ver escenas de box con esta OST, quiz\u00e1s deber\u00eda darle una oportunidad al rap....\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto a su OP y ED, he de decir que me costo los primeros 4 caps tomarle el gusto completo a su opening, siento que se adapta muy bien a la serie, y la representaci\u00f3n de Joe como un perro callejero que al final se topa con un perro blanco, clara representaci\u00f3n de Yuuri es muy buena.....y su Ending que mas que decir, es super pegadizo, creo que cada capitulo lo repetia 3 veces.\\n\\n\r\nUna de las cosas que le hicieron falta a la serie a gusto personal, fueron mas capitulos, esto se nota un poco en el desarrollo de ciertos personajes, pero mas que todo en el desarrollo de la trama, por momentos se sintio que Joe \"avanzaba muy rapido\" o que era \"invencible\" excepto por el primer encuentro con Yuuri, se puede notar como en un capitulo pasa de ser un desconocido y en el siguiente volverse en una especie de idolo, sobre todo para los mas pobres. No me malentiendan la manera estubo bien teniendo en cuenta que solo eran 13 capitulos, pero con un poco mas de episodios y hubiera quedado mejor y creo que la serie lo merecia.\\n\\n\r\nTambien critico un poco el uso de los \"Gears\" la serie nos vendio al principio que los Gears potenciaban de muchas maneras a sus usuarios y esto en el boxeo claramente era letal, pero luego nos muestran como Joe es capaz de enfrentarse en casi toda la serie sin usar un Gear, mientras que sus oponentes si \u00bfY la supuesta superioridad o mejora al tener un Gear? puedo entenderlo contra adversarios normales, pero con boxeadores profesionales eso me quito un poco de la espectacularidad del anime, parecia como que Joe se encontraba en otro nivel incluso sin un Gear, sinceramente esperaba que en el momento de entrar en Megalodonia vieramos al Joe de la portada del anime con su Gear...entiendo que eso no es ser original en el cuadriletero, el mismo Joe menciona algo asi, pero al final es como que vendieron productos de pelea un poco sobrevalorados y ni hablar que con estos exoesqueletos esa potencia en los golpes deberia sentirse un poco mas.\\n\\n\r\nLo dos parrafos de arriba son lo unico que me termino faltando en la serie, pero aun asi no me termino arruinando el espectaculo.\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto a sus personajes me encanto por sobre todos Nanbu al final, un personaje que nos mostraba una faceta dura y un exterior despreocupado, un poco embustero y que al principio no te daba seguridad, pero en el fondo era quiz\u00e1s la persona que mas se preocupaba por Joe, carism\u00e1tico, con una gran amistad y al final hizo el mayor sacrificio de todos, en el que lo considero el mejor capitulo de la serie lejos.\\n\\n\r\nSachio hace un gran trabajo como la pieza que termina de unir al equipo \"Ning\u00fan Lugar\" la pieza mas emocional y el pegamento (con un rap destacable en los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos por cierto)\\n\\n\r\nYuuri un buen rival, con un giro o decision inesperada al final, su aparici\u00f3n en el primer capitulo me dio epicidad acompa\u00f1ado con su gran tema, Fujimaki es el personaje que en realidad tiene el papel de antagonista de la serie, poniendo a los protagonistas en mucho riesgo de vida incluso, un mafioso que cumple muy bien como personaje, aunque me falto que recibiera su merecido, pero as\u00ed no es el mundo real tampoco.\\n\\n\r\nYukiko una mujer que se esconde en un cascaron frio y de grandeza, pero como se nos mostro en varios cap\u00edtulos eso esta lejos de ser verdad y por ultimo Joe es el mejor protagonista de su temporada a gusto personal, su personalidad que no puede llamarse mas que cool, su perseverancia y su capacidad por no rendirse, destaco a su actor de voz, le queda como anillo al dedo...este personaje junto con Yuuri te invitan a subir a un cuadril\u00e1tero y pelear como hombres.\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusion Megalo Box es sin duda uno de los mejores animes de deporte de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os aun con sus fallas y uno de los mejores animes de este presente a\u00f1o sin duda, resulto ser un digno homenaje a la m\u00edtica serie Ashita no Joe, un fan del box o el deporte no puede perd\u00e9rselo, \u00bfhacen falta quiz\u00e1s mas animes as\u00ed? dar\u00eda la existencia de otras dos series que segu\u00ed junta a esta, para que tuviera 25 cap\u00edtulos eso seguro.\\n\\n\r\nCalificacion: 8/10",

By approaching an art style similar to anime such as Cowboy Bebop which gives it a very western feel I can say that Megalo Box is a breath of fresh air. The voice acting in my opinion is very enjoyable and the characters have a pretty decent build-up. The soundtrack is great and really adds to the experience. What I would say makes this anime truly fun to watch is basically the large amount of action-packed scenes which keep the viewer interested aboutfuture episodes. Megalo Box is definitely an anime you should watch if you enjoy action and good plots.",

            "content": "When you hear the term \u2018boxing anime\u2019 there are two series that come to mind: Hajime no Ippo and Ashita no Joe. Ippo becoming a boxer out of wanting to become stronger and Joe Yabuki becoming a boxer by a chance meeting with a boxing coach that saw potential in him. I haven\u2019t seen any of these series... but, what I have seen is Rocky; a story about Rocky Balboa, debt collector and part-time southpaw boxer, is given a chance to fight the heavyweight champion: Apollo Creed based off of his name alone. A pretty simple premise for a film that is just so effectivewith the charismatic Rocky, the romance with Adrian, the adrenaline pumping training scenes and the drama everywhere else. All culminating into one final fight of emotion and hype! A structure that Megalobox follows while taking in the sights along the way.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing you\u2019ll immediately notice is the visual style of the show, which is very much reminiscent of series from the 90s, but just recreated using 2018 technology and nails it.The aesthetic oozes character with its detailed and recognizable character designs and its worn, lived in backgrounds that gives each environment its own sense of place in this world; with direction that shows us what each environment is like and how the characters interact in it. Each fight illustrates each fighter\u2019s unique way of fighting with their gear and well choreographed to make up for any less than stellar animation cuts from the rest of the great ones. \\n\\n\r\nIf the aesthetic of show got your attention then the music will get you invested. Each piece of music encapsulates the characters, settings and emotion throughout its entire runtime. Like how the slums area uses more hip hop and rap or how Yukiko\u2019s theme is mostly orchestral instruments given her higher status and how Yuri\u2019s theme uses a lot techno beats with his integrated gear and deadly efficiency in the ring. A great OST on its own merits that is strengthened by the series its attached to. The sounds for each fight sound crisp with the squeaks of the fancy footwork and the satisfying \u2018pop\u2019 with each punch with more powerful punches sounding like it could KO you in real life. Sound is even consistent outside of fighting with the training equipment and mechanical movements of the Gear.\\n\\n\r\nStory structure is pretty straightforward to follow. Each arc starts with the introduction of the new fighter, we learn more about the fighter, MC trains for fight, fight happens, repeat a couple more times. There able to repeat this structure because the writers are able to create interesting out of the ring conflicts that eventually build up to the actual fight. Aragaki is a particular highlight for me. Something I felt was a bit of a wasted opportunity was with the Gear. Gear seems to just be used to turn boxing into a bloody extreme sport, but I wanted to see real world applications of people using Gear in everyday life. It does get brought up towards the very end of series but did very little to satisfy this thought. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cJoe.\u201d - Joe 2018\\n\\n\r\nOur main character finally has a name, hooray! Yeah\u2026 there\u2026 isn\u2019t really to much to the characters. Not to say they were poorly written. When a new character is introduced you definitely get an idea what they are like from the couple lines of dialogue and their design; there isn\u2019t too much more to them outside of that first impression. Of course the main opponents are more fleshed out so we understand their purpose for participating in Megalonia; to the point where they have more going on with them than the main cast. However, what kept the characters interesting for me was how a majority of the cast are characterized as animals. Joe being a stray dog, Nanbu a scorpion, Fujimaki a snake, Yuri as a trained dog and how he refers to Yukiko as \u2018owner\u2019. Some fighters who aren\u2019t given enough screen have an animal as part of their ring name which pretty much defines the type of person they are. Kind of ironic how Yukiko doesn\u2019t approve of Joe for being a stray yet all the megalobox fighters are animals themselves.\\n\\n\r\nMegalobox doesn\u2019t try to do anything new or innovative with the story it\u2019s trying to tell, but instead serves as a reminder for why we love these types of stories. An underdog rising through the ranks in order to fight on the ultimate stage to show their worth. With recognizable characters that you get at an instant, detailed, sketchy art to give its rough look and music to get your blood pumping. A tried and true way to create something that is the genuine article.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is more like my overall opinion and reasons why I disliked the show than an actual in dept review. There are minor spoilers and could have mistakes here and there, as English isn't my first language.\r\nMegalo Box wasn't that good. It was just ok. The main enjoyment I got from the show were the animation and the music. Other than that, it's pretty boring. \r\nI don't even care that the ending was predictable. What bothers me is that the story felt rushed as hell. This should have been a 24 episodes anime. There's a reason why most sports anime have at least 24 episodes:characters need to be developped for watchers to want to root for them. In Megalo Box, we never learned anything from the main character, aside for the fact that he's a natural at boxing and that he has a lot of drive to win. But there does this drive come from? How the hell did he get into the slums in the first place? Why did he want to quit underground matches? Same with his main rival, the russian dude. Heck, we know more about the kid than the protagonist. There's no reason for me to want to root for Joe when I don't know who he his and where his motivation comes from. It feels like rooting for a total stranger.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the coatch, who's personality was all over the place. We can tell he's a ''bad guy with a good heart'' kind a of character, which is fine, but it was poorly handled. It felt like his personality changed from good to bad just for plot purpose. Especially towards the end, when he became blind, he suddenly became all nice and somehow knew how to teach from sound alone. I'm not saying it's impossible, but when you loose a sense as vital as view, you need more than a few days to adapt, just saying.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, as a sport anime fan, I have to say the fight scenes were not that engaging. Most were just too short to make it feel exciting, especially when I knew Joe was gonna win no matter how many times got knocked down.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I might listen to the soundtrack once in a while, especially the catchy ending, but I won't rewatch this show anytime soon, which sucks cause the artstyle is nice. Overall, Megalo Box had lots of potential, but it was poorly used. Too bad.",

Joe, the protagonist is someone with real talent for Megaloboxing, but is stuck fighting in the underground boxing arenas because he was born outside of the city, thus he can't battle in teal Megaloboxing matches. The story is about how he overcomes that fact.\r\nArt: 10\r\nI would rate it higher if I could, it's old school, and that is what makes it so great. I am an artist, thus I see how it makes the show feel different and better.\r\nThe art style makes it all the more prominentof what kind of world it is and makes it kind of more realistic, in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI am also musical and educated in music, so I feel I am classified to talk I about this. The music and overall sound of not just the matches, but encounters as well. The intense parts are really intense and the joyful parts are joyful. It's just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe characters are great, but they could be better, the ones I really liked are: Joe, Nanbu, and Aragaki. Everyone other than them really could be better. Sachio is also one of the better ones. Overall the characters aren't bad at all, they could just be a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really feel characters are important in a show, and Megalo box lacked in that area. Nothing much to say here, you could probably get what I mean with the previous parts of the review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Megalo box, and it is a great show. It's definitely one to watch and not skip out on!\\n",

            "content": "------------------------------------ Review English/Espa\u00f1ol--------------------------------\r\nA desolate world, an inhospitable world, full of thieves, of inequality separated from all civility for its citizens, away from all help, from the constant fear of not being able to do anything to improve and that there is no other way to live, where they have nothing more and deep down than hope, hope that one day everything will change.\r\nIn this place lost from the sight of God our protagonists are, naturally, swindlers, where (and it is not surprising in this world) the Megalobox is the most watched and loved sport, a small part of the place that eye of the hurricanein this a bleak world where progress and development dress up, this contrast between these two worlds makes it well seen by a large majority, you could say if I am allowed to doubt, the way they distract that Pan and Circus that each person needs,naturally the underworld to have no option is full of bets, scams, mafias but more important a place where poor people without \"nothing\" can fight ironically to get to get something they know they can never, life is hard and they They know, but that does not make them give up, they just follow the game that was set, that show fixed.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our dog, where already mentioned, is \"Nobody\", \"Nothing\", together with our coach, where from the first glance you could say that he had a better past, you can see that this is very different from our \"Dog\"; , fell to the misfortune of that world by bad decisions if I may say so, but from here things start to get complicated, in the Eye of the Hurricane of our beloved World announces a tournament, only requirement? To be Someone, something that, of course, is not our Protagonist, to aspire to that is to go against his very being, his \"Soul\", but fate had kept things for him, a meeting, if I may call him; forced,between our \"Dog\" and the main antagonist where our protagonist is already very well defined, he is, quite the contrary, the proclaimed King of Kings, the best of his time, where and to sum it up he had everything was \"Someone\", this great differentiation is the initial spark where everything begins, the preamble of what happened, having its unlike but not yet its \"Rival\", this is given shortly after but not by the work of our \"Dog\", if not the same antagonist, \u00bf How does that character who has everything, get into where there is nothing? , crucial question with a simple answer; He was missing something.\\n\\n\r\nThere are people who need very little motivation to achieve to be great things, that is the case of our protagonist, who promising to face his rival again (although the other does not consider it yet) decides to leave that place, that is, decides to be \"Someone\", there are naturally people against him, his trainer victim of a glorious past and believing in a bad future discourages him,but this already tired and seeing little by little to shine the only thing he had: La Esperanza, look like a wolf looks at the moon, and see a future, where with reasons of destiny, our coach, product of those bad decisions previously spoken, He reaches an agreement that will turn him into that being that breaks every obstacle, not without something from the product of his despair accumulated over the years.\\n\\n\r\nA name needed: Joe, it seemed that it was no longer \"Dog\" or \"Nobody\", if not someone with a future, that hope becomes stronger and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nDoing a bit returned to the World, there are some devices called: Gear, some enhancers, emphasizing not only the inequality of the place, but even the wrestlers themselves, it could be argued that these do not make the winner, but if they give a considerable advantage.\\n\\n\r\nWith that already said, it is not surprising that our protagonist does not have one, it is only for people who are \"Someone\", after an attempt of joe, where he meets our other protagonist: a small one quite common in these Anime styles of the 70s-80s, made of course as inspiration for the protagonist, you could say being with more Hope of the three, returning to the subject, Joe realizes that after that failed attempt to achieve these enhancers is not for him, can not and should not,It comes from nowhere and has to come up from nowhere, they decide (at first by advertising mode) that it will not be like the others, the Gear is something that it does not need, like it has nothing to lose (its life for him is nothing ), it is only a dog wanting to cling with everything it can to its prey.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here we see as a little ladder a step that will take you to your heart you want, a fast pace, typical of an anime of few episodes, but not extremely to appreciate both the development of him and the other protagonists, a story, if allows me to say it, predictable but honest gets same, it does not aspire to more than what it can and although it is improvable it is several things, that honesty and heart is very important, especially in an industry that for a while is said to be in decline.\\n\\n\r\nAs we progress, we learn a little about the past of the two protagonists outside the main one, since naturally, not being anyone, has nothing to show, just a constant struggle for the future.\\n\\n\r\nReturning a moment to the world, it is normal that every time that Joe is higher, his popularity increases as if it were an explosion, not using the Gear gives an impression, as a hope to the people that it seems (although it is not like that ), who lost it a long time ago.\\n\\n\r\nAt last and after overcoming obstacles, seeing old friends, faced problems of both the organizer of the tournament and the aforementioned mafia, all derived from that past where it was \"Nobody\", manages to reach its goal: The King de Reyes, confronts him again, but there is a notable difference both external (he no longer uses his Gear), as internal, no longer struggles with \"Nobody\" is with an AUTHENTIC being, full of hope for the future.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that contrast between them, if I can tell predictable but honest in what you want to be, we reveal the reason, the question of our antagonist, where despite having everything, did not carry something that our protagonist had all the time Deep down, Hope, different from it, but still no less important; the opportunity to have a Rival an Adversary, worthy of a noble being like him.\\n\\n\r\nDespite having visibly not so high budget and having a lot of recycled scenes, aesthetic images, cuts of scene ... was compensating for the good use of the camera, plans and others that denotes a great love of work, with a design that makes remember an anime of the 70-80 without losing that modern touch, making it easily entertained both for old and new school.\\n\\n\r\nWith a musical section of Hiphop combined in my opinion with Metal features very common at that time, although I do not deny it, I can be wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, an anime quite honest in what it does, characters not deep but if with their own personality and more than anything in the case of people commonly called with the genre \"Under dogs\" that is, people from the bottom of the estate get (not effortlessly) reach the summits, this story is an inspirational something very common in these animes, I recommend it to all those who seek to get away from the typical of modern anime and finally congratulate Megalo Box for being an excellent tribute to Ashita not Joe.\\n\\n\r\nSee you, Vaquero\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------- Espa\u00f1ol ------------------------------------------\\n\r\nUn Mundo desolado, un Mundo inh\u00f3spito, lleno de ladrones, de desigualdad apartado de toda civilidad para sus ciudadanos, alejadas de toda mano de ayuda, del temor constante de no poder que hacer nada para mejorar y que no hay otra manera que vivir, donde no tienen nada m\u00e1s y muy en el fondo que la esperanza, esperanza de que un d\u00eda todo cambiara.\\n\\n\r\nEn este lugar perdido de la vista de Dios nuestros protagonistas , son, naturalmente unos estafadores , donde (y no es de extra\u00f1ar en este mundo)  el Megalobox sea el deporte mas visto y amado  , una peque\u00f1a parte del lugar ese ojo del hurac\u00e1n en este mundo desolador donde el progreso y el desarrollo visten de gala , este contraste entre esos dos mundos hace que sea bien visto  por una gran mayor\u00eda, se podr\u00eda decir si se me permite dudar, la  forma en que  ellos se distraen ese  Pan y Circo que cada persona necesita , naturalmente el bajo mundo a no tener opci\u00f3n est\u00e1 llena apuestas, de estafas, mafias pero mas importante un lugar donde esa pobre gente sin \u201cNada\u201d puede luchar ir\u00f3nicamente para llegar a conseguir algo que saben que jam\u00e1s podr\u00e1n , la vida es dura y ellos lo saben, pero eso no los hace desistir simplemente siguen el juego que fue puesto , ese espect\u00e1culo arreglado.\\n\\n\r\nTenemos a nuestro perro , donde ya antes mencionado, es \u201cNadie\u201d , \u201cNada\u201d , junto con nuestro entrenador , donde desde el primer vistazo se podr\u00eda decir que tenia un mejor pasado , se nota que este muy  a diferencia de nuestro \u201cPerro\u201d , cayo a la desgracia de ese mundo por malas decisiones si se me permite decirlo , pero desde aqu\u00ed las cosas se empiezan a complicar , en el Ojo del Hurac\u00e1n de nuestro querido Mundo se anuncia un torneo, \u00bf\u00fanico requisito? Ser Alguien, algo que, por supuesto no es nuestro Protagonista, aspirar a eso es ir en contra de su mismo ser, su \u201cAlma\u201d, pero el destino tenia guardado cosas para \u00e9l , un encuentro ,si se me permite llamarlo; forzado ,entre nuestro \u201cPerro\u201d y el antagonista principal donde ya muy bien definido  nuestro protagonista \u00e9l es, naturalmente todo lo contrario, el proclamado Rey de Reyes, el mejor de su tiempo, donde y para resumirlo lo ten\u00eda todo era \u201cAlguien\u201d  ,  esta gran diferenciaci\u00f3n es la chispa inicial donde comienza todo , el pre\u00e1mbulo de lo acontecido ,teniendo a su desemejante pero aun no su \u201cRival\u201d , esta se da poco despu\u00e9s pero no por obra de nuestro \u201cPerro\u201d , si no de el mismo antagonista , \u00bfC\u00f3mo ese personaje que lo tiene todo , se mete en donde no hay nada? , pregunta crucial con una respuesta sencilla; le faltaba algo.\\n\\n\r\nHay gente que necesita de muy poca motivaci\u00f3n para lograr a ser grandes cosas, ese el caso de nuestro protagonista , que prometi\u00e9ndose enfrentar de nuevo a su rival (aunque el otro no lo considere aun) decide salir de ese lugar , es decir, decide ser \u201cAlguien\u201d ,hay naturalmente personas en contra, su entrenador victima de un pasado glorioso y creyendo en un mal futuro lo desanima , pero este ya cansado y viendo poco a poco a relucir lo \u00fanico que ten\u00eda: La Esperanza , mira como un lobo mira la luna , y ve un  futuro , donde con  razones del destino , nuestro entrenador, producto de esas malas decisiones habladas anteriormente, llega a un acuerdo lo convertir\u00e1 en ese ser que rompe todo obst\u00e1culo , no sin algo de por medio producto de su Desesperanza acumulada a largo de los a\u00f1os.\\n\\n\r\nUn nombre necesitaba: Joe, parec\u00eda que ya no era \u201cPerro\u201d o \u201cNadie\u201d, si no alguien con un futuro, esa esperanza se hace m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s fuerte.\\n\r\nHaciendo un poco devuelta al Mundo, hay unos aparatos llamados: Gear, unos potenciadores, haciendo m\u00e1s hincapi\u00e9 no solo en la desigualdad del lugar, si no hasta en los propios luchadores, se podr\u00eda argumentar que estos no hacen al ganador, pero si le dan una ventaja considerable.\\n\r\nCon eso ya dicho, no es de extra\u00f1ar que nuestro protagonista no tenga uno, es solo para personas que son \u201cAlguien\u201d ,despu\u00e9s de un intento de joe , donde conoce a nuestro otro protagonista: un peque\u00f1o bastante com\u00fan en estos estilos de Anime de los a\u00f1os 70-80 ,hecho por supuesto como inspiraci\u00f3n para el protagonista, se podr\u00eda decir el ser con mas Esperanza de los tres , volviendo al tema, Joe se da cuenta que despu\u00e9s de ese intento fallido que lograr esos potenciadores no es para \u00e9l , no puede ni debe , llego de la nada y tiene que subir de la nada , deciden (al principio por modo de publicidad) que no ser\u00e1 como los dem\u00e1s , el Gear es algo que no necesita , igual no tiene nada que perder ( su vida para \u00e9l no es nada) , solo es un Perro queriendo aferrarse con todo lo que puede a su presa.\\n\\n\r\nDesde aqu\u00ed vemos como escala poco uno escalones que lo llevaran hacia su coraz\u00f3n desea, un ritmo r\u00e1pido , propio de un anime de  pocos episodios  , pero no extremadamente para poder apreciar tanto el desarrollo  de \u00e9l como de los otros protagonistas , una historia , si se me permite decirlo, predecible  pero honesta consigue misma , no aspira a mas de lo que puede y aunque es mejorable es varios cosas, esa honestidad y coraz\u00f3n es muy importante, en especial en una industria que hace rato se dice que anda en decadencia.\\n\\n\r\nAl progresar, nos enteramos un poco del pasado de los dos protagonistas ajenos al principal, ya que naturalmente a no ser nadie, no tiene nada que mostrar, solo una lucha constante para el futuro.\\n\\n\r\nRegresando un momento al mundo, es normal que cada vez que Joe esta mas alto, su popularidad aumenta como si de una explosi\u00f3n se tratase, al no usar el Gear da una impresi\u00f3n, como una esperanza a ese pueblo que parece (aunque no es as\u00ed), que la perdi\u00f3 hace mucho tiempo.\\n\\n\r\nAl fin y despu\u00e9s de superar obst\u00e1culos, viendo a viejos amigos, enfrentado problemas tanto de la compa\u00f1\u00eda organizadora del torneo y de la mafia anteriormente citada, todas ellas derivadas de ese pasado donde no era \u201cNadie\u201d, consigue llegar a su objetivo: El Rey de Reyes, lo enfrenta otra vez, pero hay una diferencia notable tanto externa (ya no usa su Gear), como interna, ya no lucha con \u201cNadie\u201d esta con un AUTENTICO ser, lleno de esperanza del futuro.\\n\\n\r\nDespu\u00e9s de esa contraposici\u00f3n entre ellos, si me permite decirle predecible pero honesta en lo que quiere ser, se nos revela el motivo, la pregunta de nuestro Antagonista, donde a pesar de tenerlo todo, no llevaba consigo algo que nuestro protagonista ten\u00eda todo el tiempo muy en fondo, La esperanza, diferente de est\u00e9, pero aun as\u00ed no menos importante; la oportunidad de tener un Rival un Adversario, digno de un ser noble como \u00e9l.\\n\\n\r\nA pesar de contar con visiblemente no tan alto presupuesto y contar mucho con escenas recicladas, im\u00e1genes est\u00e9ticas, cortes de escena\u2026 fue compensando por el buen uso de la c\u00e1mara, planos y dem\u00e1s que denota un gran amor al trabajo, con un dise\u00f1o que hace recordar un anime de los 70-80 sin perder ese toque moderno, haci\u00e9ndolo f\u00e1cilmente entretenido tanto para vieja como nueva escuela.\\n\\n\r\nCon un apartado musical del Hip- hop combinado a mi parecer con rasgos Metal muy com\u00fan en aquella \u00e9poca, aunque y no lo niego, puedo equivocarme.\\n\\n\r\nEn fin, un anime bastante honesto en lo que hace , personajes no profundos pero si con personalidad propia y m\u00e1s que nada trat\u00e1ndose de personas llamadas com\u00fanmente con el g\u00e9nero \u201cPerros callejeros\u201d es decir, personas que desde lo m\u00e1s bajo del estamento consiguen (no sin esfuerzo) llegar a la cimas, trat\u00e1ndose esta historia de una inspiracional algo muy com\u00fan en estos animes, la recomiendo a todos aquellos que busquen alejarse de lo t\u00edpico del anime moderno y para terminar felicito a Megalo Box por ser un Excelente homenaje a Ashita no Joe.\\n\\n\r\nNos vemos, Vaquero\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok so some friend of mine on discord was like going \"Holy shit, Megalo Box is the best\" and like shoving that into everyone's faces. I was like alright, I'll watch it, and I'll make sure to give it a bad review because you are annoying. Turns out, I can't give it a bad review because it doesn't deserve one. Here's why.\r\nWhat is it good at: \r\nFirstly, it lacks a god complex. You know how when you watch SAO and you know oh Kirito is gonna bash the shit out of every monster while entertaining his harem? Well this is like completely opposite. Literally everyfight doesn't guarantee that your main character will win. He actually loses in some rounds due to some sinister sabotage. And even if he does win, it's usually at the very end when he's like half dead. It brings surprise and uncertainty to the table. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, consistency. It recognizes it's a boxing anime, and it acts like one. It doesn't decide to drop out for that one episode to talk about fanservice or shopping. Every episode talks about either training or boxing or both. So you can bet that you are watching a boxing anime rather than slice of life romance. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, audio. Can't stress it enough. But you know it's well produced when the moment you step in the arena and it sounds like an arena. The sound is just as big as what you see on screen. Music goes for the appropriate hip hop, rough on the edges, hood style music, rapping  about survival. Not a big fan of hip hop, but I am surprised how suitable it was. Voice actors were nothing too special but not offending.\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, character. This. This is the literal bros club. Not a lot of characters, only a hand full you need to know. But every character is molded into a fighting machine that trust each other. The sort of you got my back characteristics that the main characters have is what gave the character a lot of freshness and development. Antagonists are fine, sly, tactical but nothing really getting on my nerves, apparently most of them have a heart and just want a good fight.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the bigger picture. The aim of the story is super clear. No guessing is needed. The very first episode literally just shows you this barren slum community and on the other side is a modern city and stuff. The literal contrast between underground boxing and megalonia. The anime and its goal is just very simple to understand, no university degree required.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat is mixed?\\n\\n\r\nWell, art. You need some time to get used to especially if you came from watching moe blobs. This anime is literally a throwback to the 90s. Rough on the edges, detail and line sharpening to the max. I literally have to check if I'm watching in 240p because that's how much of a shock i had. But to its credit, it fits the industrial, steampunk theme but you really need some time to get used to it. Not for everyone but I'm sure someone will love it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat did it stumble on?\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, there were some scenes that I didn't quite understood it's necessity or relevance to the anime, like when the kid stays in the rich woman's house, not sure why. But to its credit, it's only brief. So it's a problem but it's not something that i can heavily discredit for.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, character depth. Something's missing. It has a lot of character interaction. I love that. But is has not much depth. Aside the money issues, fame or revenge is not really a convincing motivation to buy into a character. There's no backstory, we don't know anything about anybody except that pops owes money to some dude. It's a huge blow to an otherwise great character development. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo like at the end of the day, if you ask me. Is this a good anime. The answer is yes. It's a well developed, adrenaline pumped, arena sounding anime that will bound to keep you to your seats. But if you ask me, is this better than Ashita no joe. No. It's just not as deep as what Ashita no joe can deliver. To me, if Ashita no joe is clannad, this is charlotte. Is it better than cowboy bepop, ehhhhhhh, not quite, but it's close enough that you'll enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nBut here's where i differ. I think that if you are impressed with this anime like I am, Ashita no joe will absolutely blow you away. If you watch cowboy bepop, watch this. If you watch Ashita no joe, ehhh, don't expect it to be better.",

            "content": "Just a warning, if you watch this show expecting Ippo, please turn back right now. Even though these two shows are both mainly about boxing, their focus of plot is totally different in how they handle their characters and story. \r\nWhen I first watched this I was also expecting Ippo type of fights as I heard a lot of hype about this show, even though the show had ok-ish fights it was never anything out of the ordinary that got my blood pumping nor did it give a rush of adrenaline. Fights are more slow paced and they use it to tell a story ratherthan giving you a dosage of action. Each fight gives a new perspective and characteristics to a character and it worked well in making you root for both sides almost every fight. Also, the ending was done really well and gave closure.\\n\\n\r\nI think the best part about this anime is the music, its chil, hip-hop soundtrack is worth a listen and also fit the themes of the show really well. The animation was also nice, as it seemed to have been inspired from many of the 90's anime with a bit of modern touch. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is about storytelling through fights and it is worth a watch as it has its unique charm to it.",

            "content": "\u201cShow me what real Megalo boxing looks like!\u201d - Yuri\r\nMegalo Box is easily one of the most hyped and best anime of 2018. The  storytelling, fights, the unique art style, the intensity, everything was breathtaking!\r\nHave you watched Ashita no Joe & Ippo and are still craving more boxing anime? Or maybe you\u2019ve never seen them and want a shorter, alternative with the same level of hype and storytelling? If so, i\u2019ll present to you Megalo Box!  \r\nMegalo Box is a homage to the great boxing series- Ashita no Joe, set in a futuristic, cyber punk type setting following a boxer called J.D. \u201cJunkDog\u201d. It\u2019s got a 80s themed, hip hop, gritty, atmosphere to it and gives of Samurai Champloo/Cowboy Bepop feels.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7/10\\n\r\nPretty typical, boxing underdog story. It\u2019s a story about a boy named Junk Dog fighting his way through the Megalo tournament to fight the champion. Sounds pretty simple right? The main difference here is the inclusion of gears that fighters wore, as it enhanced their physiycal capabilities. However not our protagonist. He enters without using gears and dons the name \u201cGearless Joe\u201d. What I didn\u2019t like was the gangster sub plot (where Joe and Nanbu entered the tournament to pay him back) because it\u2019s too cliche and has been done so many times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nI would say this was the weakest point to me. There\u2019s a diverse cast of characters, however there\u2019s only a few characters with decent characterisation whilst the rest are rather flat. I think the best written characters were Aragaki and Nanbu. I feel we could have explored more on Joe, Yuri, Yukiko and her brother\u2019s past (SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Joe: we don\u2019t know Joe\u2019s childhood, why he became a boxer, whether he has any relatives (was he an orphan in the system?), why he came to the city Nanbu saw him in (or did he grew up there?)\\n\\n\r\nYuri: All we know is that he had a trainer in his boxing club when he first met Yukiko. Again, we know virtually nothing little about his upbringing/life. Why does Yuri view Yukiko so highly, as to call orders from her and call her his owner? There has to be a deeper meaning than Yuri working for her. \\n\\n\r\nFights: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThere were some decently choreographed fights. You could tell were most of the punches landed and it had some really standout moments. However, for the most part the fights were lacklustre. That\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve seen better fights in Ippo. A lot of Joe\u2019s fights were him getting pounded and then he making a comeback and wining in the end. It became a bit predictable.\\n\r\nThe training was rather basic. It didn\u2019t really teach me any boxing moves, compared to other boxing series. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nI love the dull (is that the right word? ), low quality animation. It made the world feel more gritty and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nI love the hip hip hop soundtracks, it really encompasses the 80s-themed setting they were going for. I loved the OP and ending song. The raps were amazing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI loved Megalo box. It was my most hyped and anticipated anime this season. I was pumped every week waiting for the next episode to be released. \\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box would have been better if it was 24 episodes as it would have covered some of the flaws I had with it e.g. Joe\u2019s characterisation. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019ll give Megalo Box a 8/10",

            "content": "Warning! Minor Spoilers Ahead! \r\nAnimation has been noticeably changing over the years. As technology grows and improves, so does animation styles as most anime these days are slick and clean whereas you look back in the 90s where many anime were cell shaded with heavy outlines and rough textures. It is kind of amazing how animation has evolved and how easier it is to animate now compared to animating anime years ago. But today I am reviewing an anime that pays homage to the 90s style of animation using modern technology to animate to bring this art style to the modern era. \r\nSo sit backand relax as I present to you the anime review for Megalobox. \"Lets get ready to Rumbllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a dystopian city where the world is mesmerised by the sport of Boxing where boxing is amplified by the use of augmented gear to make the sport more physical and dangerous. The story follows Junk Dog or Joe (depending on how you want to call him), a nameless, underground boxer that throws boxing matches for money. However, after meeting with the boxing champion Yuuri and being challenged to a match where they duke it out in a boxing ring, JD vows to challenge him again in his ring at the major boxing event Megalonia where whoever wins that becomes world champion. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very much a proper underdog story where JD has to start from the very bottom and work his way all the way to the top. But there is more than just boxing his way to the top as he and his teammates, Sachio and Nanbu, have to also deal with gangs and corporations as they have ways to derail JD from becoming the number one boxer. What's interesting here is that the  story is not just another rookie learning skills as he goes along (although it is still there), this is about a boxer who has already got skill but is held back by outside interference. It is a different kind of underdog story that makes it refreshing to see. It perfectly matches this gritty anime where the world is cruel and unforgiving and you have to fight not only to win, but to survive.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime also gives us the question of whether augmentation actually makes things better or worse. In this case of boxing, does it improve the boxer or make him worse? JD answers this question as he goes through most of the anime without using a gear to augment his boxing skills. Questioning whether the gears make the boxer or the boxer makes the gears look like they improved the boxer itself. It kind of makes you question whether the gears actually add anything to the anime and if there removal would affect the anime in anyway? Well it does in some instances in the story as it plays a key role but in other situations, it doesn't. The emphasis is on the boxing itself rather than the augmentations that amplify it. This makes the gears nothing more than a novelty at times, emphasising that JD is the real deal when he walks into the ring without a gear on. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about Junk Dog/Joe. Junk Dog is a no nonsense, gritty boxer who has no name. This is why he addresses himself as Junk Dog, he is no one. This is why he doesn't have a backstory, he is no-one important. Very much makes sense since this being an underdog story, he starts from the very bottom without knowing anything about him. That means that anything we learn of him in the present gives us and idea of his character throughout all of his life. It leaves us open to guessing who he is. All he wants to do is to get into the ring and have a good boxing match but that mindset also what gets him into trouble at times with his team, the people around him and also himself. This is because he is short tempered and stubborn because once he makes up his mind, good luck trying to stop him which, in turn, gets him into trouble. \\n\\n\r\nHis teammates, Sachio and Nanbu don't share this no-one personality as they have there own reasons for wanting to join JD and help get him to Megalonia. Now matching the setting, they aren't exactly happy backstories and have some dark reasonings behind them which led them to where they are now. Nanbu is in debt to a gang which influences his actions quite a bit. He is a guy you would think is sleazy and selfish (and you would be right) but the fact is that he actually cares for those who are close to them and want what is best for them. Sachio uses JD as a crutch to get back at someone for the fate of his family and as such, is more defined than the rest of the characters. Loud, rude but knows what is best. He is kind of like the glue that holds the team together and with JD and Nanbu disagreeing with each other half the time, they really do need Sachio. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own role in the story and have their own reasons as to why they do the things they do. This lead to to a conclusion that there isn't really any clear cut villains as each character has their own justifiable reasons for their actions. The closest to a villain we get is Fujimaki, the gang leader that Nanbu is in debt to. But also helps him get what he wants for the right price and agreements. But still, he is shady so he is the main body block for our main characters. Even Yuri, the main rival, isn't really a villain as he has respect for JD as he is the \"genuine article\" and respects his style of boxing. He fully believes JD will give him the best challenge and fighting and beating will make him believe that he is a \"genuine champion.\"  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat I think is the main selling point of this show is its animation. As I hinted back at the start, the animation harpers back to the 90s animation style with heavy black outlines as the anime goes for a more cell shaded, hand drawn art style. And you know what, it works. Instead of a clean, polished art style, we get a more gritty art style that matches the tone of the show. But with modern technology, it actually animates better than it would in the 90s which was to be expected. So it is more than an homage to older anime art styles like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop. It brings that art style to the modern day and gives it a modern face lift while still keeping that animation style. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also like is the lack of 3D animation in this show. Now there are a couple of scenes where 3D animation is used but it isn't in any fight scenes. Instead, the anime uses great use of cinematography and slow motion effects to capture the fights scenes brilliantly. And I'm telling you, these fight scenes are brilliant. Despite it being obvious who is going to win, the execution of these fight scenes are done brilliantly and is where the animation really shines. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Samurai Champloo's OST, then you are going to love this. The soundtrack just has so much character to it and works well with this show being a gritty, dystopian anime. Rap tracks just work well with these kinds of shows because they give this kind of atmosphere where it isn't all sunshine and rainbows and it is more like \"Put up or shut up!\" But if you don't like Samurai Champloo's OST then you ain't getting much enjoyment here since it is almost entirely rap. As someone who likes Samurai Champloo's OST, I got a kick out of this soundtrack as it was so fun to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is another good tone setter as it features a stray dog (referring to JD) going around and doing what it wants and picking fights with other dogs. It gives us an idea of what JD is like in this show and his attitude. The song, \"Bite\" by Leo Imai complements this opening well with a sense of anger and rage in its vocals to add to the fact that this is one vicious stray dog. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending is nothing to write home about as it is nothing more than a glorified credit sequence with neon lights as a frame to scroll down with the credits. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nMegalobox is a highly enjoyable boxing anime that has so much style and character to it. With its well told underdog story, brilliant use of animation and enjoyable OST sees me finishing Megalobox very satisfied. It is more than a homage to 90s animation style. It takes that animation style and modernises it to give a new spin on it. My complaints with this show are only minor ones and I enjoyed the positives much more than a I hated the negatives. It's gritty, It's exhilarating, it's what I look for in an anime. \"Entertainment.\" It is simply a fantastic and I highly recommend to everyone to check out this one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMy personal Enjoyment: 9.5 \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9.3/10  Recommendation: Go f*****g watch it",

            "content": "There is a place, a place where those who have few more things than their fists use them to make a living. That place is an Underground Boxing (or rather, Megalo Boxing) Arena. \r\nAnd it's in this place where we find our main character, enter Junk Dog, a.k.a Joe (he doesn't have a 'real' name, but I won't go further into that because, uh, spoilers), Joe is partnered with his coach of sorts, Gansaku Nanbu, to throw their matches and so get some money from local Yakuza. Joe is increasingly tired of this situation and one day the Megalo Boxing Champion, Yuri. This encounter willlead Joe to find his new purpose: to get into the Megalo Boxing championship, Megalovania, and fight Yuri. It won't be easy though...\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was created as an homage to the overwhelmingly succesful manga (in Japan) Ashita no Joe (which started publishing 50 years before this show started airing) and as such, we can see characters in this show serving as tributes to characters in the original Ashita no Joe: MB Joe resembles (quite clearly) AnJ Joe, Yuri resembles Rikiishi, Nanbu resembles Danpei Tange, Yukiko Shirato resembles Yoko Shiraki and so on. \\n\r\nAs for the actual characters, they all come from different backgrounds and this is something you can see in their behavior: Nanbu is an alcoholic because he is pretty poor (and alcoholism is something that has typically haunted the lower classes), Yukiko speaks in a very refined way because she comes from a wealthy family, Sachio speaks quite brashly because he is a kid from with a difficult past, etc. That said, someone may find these characters bland in some way, and I don't blame them. But eventually I did find myself attached to them, so I guess they work for some people, but not for others.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art. If you watch this show for like 5 minutes you will notice something weird on the art. That is, characters (and sometimes backgrounds) are hand-drawn, this is again, done as a tribute to the old Ashita no Joe anime series from the 70s-80s. This traditional artwork looks fine, but it is nothing compared to old cel-animated shows, but it gives the series some originality over others from its same season. \\n\r\nDigital backgrounds look super nice, especially scoreboards and everything that has to do with technology, it really looks like it's the real deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is phenomenal, techno beats (I'm not a music conoisseur, so if forgive me if it isn't really techno) surround many of the best moments in the show and so the viewer feels hyped and impressed by the atmosphere. Truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a damn good show, a real surprise this season. Whether you like boxing (or sports in general) anime or not, or if you have watched the original Joe's misadventures or you haven't I would really recommend this show to you. Truly a strong contender for anime of the year.",

            "content": "Now that Megalo Box's English dub recently finished on Toonami I am finally able to watch the series. For those who don't know, Megalo Box is a homage to the classic manga and anime Ashita no Joe which just turned 50 last year. As a fan of Joe, I was of course excited to see what Box was and what it had to offer. Before starting, I would like to clarify that I'm not a super anime elitist that loves classics like Ashita no Joe to death, and believe that its the best thing to come from anime. Yes, I love Joe but it definitivelyhas flaws, and season 2 isn't even in my top 20 anime. I will be comparing Box to Joe when I need to, but I would like to try and judge Box as its own thing.\\n\r\nSPOILERS FOR: Megalo Box & Ashita no Joe\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nMegalo Box sets place in a current day where a new type of boxing is invented titled Megalo Boxing, where boxers fight each other with a special gear attached to their bodies. It's an interesting concept but the series rarely does anything with it. Most of the gears aren't that special or unique and don't seem to affect the story in anything significant way. The only interesting gear that stands out above the rest would be Mikio Shirato's. Halfway through, Mikio challenges Joe to a match, but forces him to quit out of blackmail. Later it is revealed that Mikio was just scared of Joe since his gear would be less effective against him. Mikio's gear has the ability to sense and predict what someone else's gear will do which is cool and all, but doesn't really effect the match with Joe. This leads into another one of Box's flaws: The fights. I don't think I can remember any fight where I felt scared, relieved, or even excited. The fights are just really weak in general, they aren't BAD per say, they're just there. Joe's first fight in Megalonia was interesting since it showed him getting use to other boxers outside of the underground dog fights that he was used to. However, nearly every other fight is pretty bland and forgettable. Yeah, they have their moments and got me enjoying them since it's boxing and I'm a sucker for two guys beating the shit out of each other, but overall they feel weak. Ashita no Joe's fights were the main staple of the series, but even so it had plenty of enjoyable fights that made me question whether or not Joe would survive or not. The overall plot of Box is just Joe making his way through Megalonia and becoming the champion which isn't anything new, and similarly with the fights, it's pretty bland. Box's main flaw would most likely be its episode count since 13 episodes is just way too short for a series like this. I could imagine this being at least 26 episodes and imagine it being significantly better since they would be able to fix some of its big flaws. Box needed more time to help convey some of its ideas. We could have seen more and longer fights that were just told better, and could potentially see more of the effects of the gears used. Box's story is it's weakest aspect, but thankfully it will only get better from here.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMegalo Box looks really good and has a unique art style that I love. It feels dirty, muddy, and unclean. It gives the series a sort of rough feeling, it's just really cool and feels completely different from every other anime made today. It's character designs are good, and I love seeing how the team was inspired from Joe's characters. In terms of animation, Box is fairly good. The animation during fights isn't anything great but its fine, nothing to complain about. I don't want to start complaining about how every other boxing anime looks worse than Ippo since Madhouse is just insane. \\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OST is good, and both the OP and ED are solid as well. Viz's English dub is enjoyable, not great, but like most dubs, I overall enjoyed it. My only gripe would be when Sachio started rapping which made my jaw dropped out of how bad and stupid it sounded. But besides that, Box has a solid soundtrack with good voice actors.\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they were all mostly fine. Joe is a good protagonist and was enjoyable throughout its run. Nanbu was enjoyable as well, but besides him and Joe, no one else stood out that much. None of the characters were bad, they were all just effected by the series having 13 episodes. Joe's rival, Yuuri, feels pretty bland and we almost get no screen time of him until the last couple episodes. He gets some good moments here and there, but again, we don't have enough time to enjoy him and get to know what he's really like. Most of the boxers that Joe fights aren't that great either besides maybe Aragaki who even then is just fine. I stated this earlier and I really don't like to do this, but I think Box is in a scenario where it is okay to compare it to another series that does an aspect leagues better than it does. Of course I'm talking about Ashita no Joe, which is what Box is paying a homage to. Ashita no Joe's strongest aspect was its characters. Joe was a great and deep character that struggled throughout his boxing career. We even saw him go through depression for a good while of the series and felt relieved once he got out of it. His rival, Rikiishi was another great and memorable character who struggled and risked his life in order to fight Joe in the ring. We see both Joe and Rikiishi going through incredibly brutal and hard times, meanwhile things like this are almost never seen in Megalo Box. There are literally entire episodes spent where Rikiishi and Joe are starving themselves in order to fight inside the ring. Those episodes felt painful to watch at moments and felt unreal. Characters in Box don't have any of these moments and it's really concerning considering moments like those were what so many people loved about the original Joe. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nA good amount of enjoyment I got out of Box was seeing the references and differences that were made from Ashita no Joe. I loved seeing how much Nanbu looked like Danpei, how drastic this Joe looked but managed to keep some similarities in there, and even noticing how similar Yuuri looked like Rikiishi. Besides that, Box is entertaining overall but it doesn't have any amazing moments that will make you scream. I was able to complete Box with no problem and don't have much to complain or praise about that I haven't already. \\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nMegalo Box is overall a good short series that is just good on its own. As a homage however, I would say its meh since it is inspired by Ashita no Joe. Box doesn't really get what made the original Joe so good and its sad that those ideas weren't implemented into Box. In the end, I would still recommend Megalo Box, but I wouldn't say that you need to watch it as soon as you can. I still can't tell if you should watch this first, get enjoyment out of it, and then see Ashita no Joe and get a lot more enjoyment from it. Anyway, Box is good, but not great, it could have been better if it had more episodes. \\n",

It achieves resonance in the world it builds in the background: a country implied to be consumed in an ongoing war, that has left in it's wake a culture of violence, as well as broken people -- literally, in several instances, full of missing limbs -- and a broken culture -- a messy history, a marginalized society, a generation of people without a past. \r\nJoe is not only in the center, he encapsulates this world, as someone who has only one thing going for him: the fight.He doesn't fight for glory nor riches, neither to prove his worth: he fight because this is all that is left. He doesn't seem particularly oppressed by this world (although being a victim of it, but so are all the other characters), there isn't even a great villain. Even though there is drama surrounding the fights, the climax is very simple: even as we reach to a better future, there is only the present. And Joe grabs at it like a desperate dog, thrashing and barking to prove that he's alive. 'Megalo Box' feels like a primal howl of life's affirmation, which gets to be unexpectedly emotional for a story that builds up to a perfect final punch.",

Will it get me into the genre completely? probably not, but it has really opened my eyes to what this genre can be and i highly recommend this to anyone on the fence about sports anime\r\nArt 10/10\r\nOne of the first things you need to look at when talking about Megalo Box is its art style, it just screams the 90's seemingly taking influence from shows like Cowboy Bebop and for that I need to give it a 10 on this.\r\nCharacters 8/10\r\nSome of the characters in this can be seen as pretty box standard,hell i mean Joe himself isn't the most colourful of characters, sure you can really feel the passion for what he does but i personally feel like the only two characters making this an 8 on characters are Nanbu and Yuri. The development you see from these to characters are so powerful: Nanbu coming from a man seen as a scorpion that uses people because its in his nature and Yuri just some douche no one likes but turning into characters that have developed into something much more than that to the point where i sometimes rooted for Yuri as well as Joe for the final fight making the ending so much more satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nThe Hip-hop feel really did fit this anime super well but the music itself even though fitting wasn't really anything special by itself personally so ill give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nThe story is very generic, your underdog character Joe (Junk dog) starting from nowhere and rising up through the rankings to fight the champion. Can't really fault the story but again like the sound, nothing too special here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nContrary to how i said the story itself is quite generic it truly is a great anime that i think you should all at least give it a try. It has honestly gave me goosebumps with every fight (like i get at a real boxing match) a feeling that i don't recall ever getting when watching anime. The Joe himself isn't a character i feel has developed as well from the story as others his stubbornness really forces you to root for him and the risks and sacrifices made to get him where he is it really makes you hope that it all just works out ok in the end and you cant fault that at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a 9/10 for me personally: The characters, the feelings i got during the fight scenes. I don't think ill ever forget this anime and i urge you all to give it a try because you wont regret it and im really happy this was my introduction to the sports anime genre.",

            "content": "The beauty of anime is unrivaled power to the author. Any premise, any character; any plot, any idea; any moment, and any image. It has limitless potential as a medium. In blatant disregard to such majesty stands Megalo Box. It's existence towers in disrespect to both art and storytelling. Every moment exists as a spit in the face to the audience for attempting to glean even the smallest sliver of value from the material. There is no justification for this facade of entertainment; it's a story where the characters don't matter. Completely driven by plot, any attempt of buildup is eradicated by time skips andfabricated intended outcomes. Cause and effect don't exist in this world, nothing you will find here makes rational sense.\\n\\n\r\nIf the above wasn't clear enough already, here's the specific: A previously untrained, uneducated, street urchin becomes the champion of the deadly sport of cybernetically enhanced boxing, without the \\n\r\nuse of cybernetics. How does he do this? We don't know. The story for some reason skips most of those parts. What we do and don't learn are many things. \\n\\n\r\n1.) Post the pilot episode where the premise is explained, the sport magically discontinues to be bloody and deadly mess. \\n\r\n2.) Apparently none of the hundreds of other fighters who have actually trained for years are \"The Real Deal\", whatever that means.\\n\r\n3.) Who is the kid in the hat, and why are you here? Remember how your friends literally needed you for survival and you immediately ditched them to live with strangers?\\n\r\n4.) How can you have fully functional bionic legs and feet for amputees, but not hands?\\n\r\n5.) Apparently your fully functional bionic legs and feet suck ass, despite being the 17th best fighter? But only now are causing you problems because you're fighting the MC...?\\n\r\n6.) How was the AI gear magically changed to not need other gear to detect for its sensors?\\n\r\n7.) How does removing an eyeball atone for losing millions and millions of dollars, in the face of people who have killed others for far far less?\\n\r\n8.) What kind of bad guy reveals his evil intentions to the good guy with a double-cross in the exact moment where the good guy holds all the power in the situation?\\n\r\n9.) How can a man who lost his sight yesterday have both tremor sense and perfect hearing sense? \\n\r\n10.) Is it a wolf or a dog?\\n\r\n11.) Why does it randomly bark at things?\\n\r\n12.) What was the actual dream of Yukiko? Joining the Military Industrial Complex?\\n\r\n13.) Why did Yuuri abandon Yukiko?\\n\r\n14.) Why did Yuuri join Yukiko to fight for her dream in the first place?\\n\r\n15.) As the champion fighter, isn't majorly handicapping yourself for the final \"Real Deal\" fight the most disrespectful thing you can do?\\n\r\n16.) Oh I guess the scientist/entrepreneur/top-fighter is an expert in very dangerous, never performed before surgey, and can do it all in his basement, by himself. \\n\r\n17.) How does the MC win every fight with a single punch to the face? His frame is smaller than every other character, and uses no cybernetics.\\n\r\n18.) And finally, why would you build a new massive megadome project and not put a roof on it?\\n\\n\r\nDoes this list of atrocities cover everything? Absolutely not. But for the sake of brevity, let's move on with our lives.\\n\r\nArt and Music were below standard.",

To Joe, finding the perfect opponent is what gives him purpose to keep fighting, but itis not that easy, as he goes through obstacles on daily bases.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is a classic, a fighter who wants a real challenge, but with a twist as there are new ideas introduced to the sport, also there are a lot of background stories, and many supporting materials that builds up to why everything is the way it is in the current time. \\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n Simply amazing! As it portrays the beautiful 90's art style in a clean way that fits our high definition standards of nowadays. Think about an improved Cowboy Bebop art style\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSoundtracks are unique and enjoyable\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n cool, calm, smooth, strong and brave...The type of character that you could see yourself in\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nTo me, this by far was the most interesting anime to be released since the release of \"Made in Abyss\". The reason to compare both to each other is the fact that no other shows \"recently\" were able to keep me waiting for the release of the new episodes like these 2 did. The point is some shows are so \"unique\" and special that they will keep you waiting for more, and Megalo Box was definitely worth the time and became an all time favorite to me.\\n\r\n10/10",

This all changes when they announce 'megalon', this giant international machineboxing tournament to become the WORLD CHAMPION and what also sparks this is when he runs into the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nmore information about the story:\\n\\n\r\nfrom the start of episode 1 i got too much chills,when they said Ashita no Joe 50th anniversary project i started to like it because if you know what Ashita no Joe is, its a manga by the writer Asao Takamori and it was illustrated by Tetsuya Chiba and it was on 1968. that's the reason why they made Megalo Box.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 'THIS MAY CONTAIN LITTLE BIT OF SPOILERS' \\n\\n\r\nThe art was amazing the moment i saw the slow motion in the fight 'in the end of ep1' I've got the real chills there, and the fight in the first of the episode, even though he didn't fight hes punch was so good that even i thought that was some hajime no ippo reference lol. and the art somehow it makes you think its like old anime but with good quality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nsound:\\n\\n\r\nThe ost 'original sound track' in the fights and the start of the anime was a MASTERPIECE,it makes me remember the old anime I've watched such as cowboy bebop or ashita no joe.\\n",

            "content": "So I really only have one con for this anime, but to me it's a big one.  With that being said let's start with the pros.\r\n1.  The music and art is fantastic.  I'm a huge fan of Cowboy Beebop and Samurai Champloo and both do a great job of using very unique jazz+rock combination that presents a very chill yet intense atmosphere.  While I understand those principles conflict with each other I think that's what makes the music so unique and awesome.  I have the album from this anime downloaded and I love listening to it.  \r\nI'm also ahuge fan of the art.  The main story-line doesn't go into a lot of detail about the setting, but it doesn't have to because the artwork does such a good job of literally painting a picture.  It's very obvious that in this world you are either upper class or lower class, there is no in-between and this is all taken from the artwork.  Furthermore, the contrast that is presented with each scene sets the mood perfectly your eyes are in constant motion.\\n\\n\r\n2. Character\\n\\n\r\nGranted the whole \"started from the bottom and now we are here\" concept is pretty mainstream they do a great job in this series presenting the characters as actually struggling mentally and emotionally.  It is much more than just \"I was an outcast and wanted to be recognized as a member of all society\" or \"I had no talent and I worked hard and got better\".  This is a character who doesn't care who he's associated with and he's someone who already has a large amount of natural talent.  He pretty much represents the middle-finger and that's what I love about his character so much.\\n\\n\r\n3.  Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI mean after what I posted I obviously enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n4. My one con\\n\r\nTHE SHOW IS CALLED MEGALOBOX AND THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES ALMOST NO MEGALOBOXING.  I mean come on, how is this not infuriating.  The whole concept of megaloboxing is there is new strategies, more power, more moves that must be considered when fighting.  The main character in megalobox resorts to no megaloboxing.  Like I understand the direction they were going with, but the story could've presented a similar message while still having a decent amount of megaloboxing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't try to play the rational card when rating anime but someone knocking someone out with no gear versus a literal machine increasing your force output by 10 times? Come on now.",

            "content": "Megalo Box is a 50th-year-anniversary rehash of the very popular (and a personal favorite of mine )Ashita No Joe. The anime's art was gorgeous, lending a bit of authenticity to a long-gone era of hand-drawn animation which is scarcely seen in recent animes. The soundtrack written in collaboration with a Hip-hop artist was pretty good but can't be compared to that of Devilman Crybaby and Samurai Champloo. The characters were mehish at best, the fights were lackluster and didn't do justice to the original source material at all. Because in Ashita, Joe was a really strong boxer with a killer punch, in this too Joedoes indeed have a killer punch but he wins fights mostly on his luck or his final punch, most of the time he is left sprawling on the mat. Everybody's motivations were also not fleshed properly like\" Oh you are the real deal? I will fight you\". The nominations to the top 4 were arbitrary too. The execution as in the direction and the CGI use was minimal and used to its full extent. They all leave us in the dark about who won the final battle but I will take it. All in all, it had all the potential to be a great anime because of having such a source material but it turned out to be average at best. It is still a decent watch. Don't watch this if you wanna satisfy your boxing appetite, because boxing scenes are pretty scarce and unsatisfying for a boxing anime. You would be better off watching the OG Ashita no Joe or Hajime No Ippo.",

            "content": "I\u2019ll admit it \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen the original Ashita no Joe, or any boxing-related anime for that matter. Hell, I\u2019ve barely watched any of it on TV, or any form of media. But the sport has always fascinated me, for the strategic depth that goes on for both sides of the fight, and the sometimes-sheer brutality of it. So when I saw a trailer for Megalo Box, not only was there this gritty, brutal boxing series, but it was combined with the pseudo mech-like aesthetic in the form of the Gears, which initially captured my attention \r\nI know this has always been a pointof contention with Megalo Box\u2019s critics, but I absolutely adore the 480p, 90s aesthetic Megalo Box presents from the get-go. Outside of it\u2019s wonderful characters, I think the aesthetic and world design of this show are my absolute favourites \u2013 the whole world feels worn, broken at times, even the bustling yet somewhat seedy major city the show takes place in, giving it a very Blade Runner vibe that I can\u2019t get enough of. This show is absolutely teeming with beautiful shots of the world, my personal favourite being the stormy highway Joe has his first encounter with Yuri on. At times, the show can be very brown and boring to look at, but I say this in a way that it feels natural and right, rather than just laziness or bad art direction.  The sound direction is also fantastic \u2013 there aren\u2019t a ton of songs that are memorable, but they go a long way to set the tone and feeling of the world, which I feel is more important then just pure hype music \u2013 which isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t any in the fights, but just about every character theme is a gem.\\n\\n\r\n Megalo Box is one of those shows where the fights are less about the technical quality of them \u2013 the animation is never bad, but it never, sans some very cool occasional moments, reaches amazing levels. Instead, the bouts Joe fights in are usually waged on a more idealistic level \u2013 the wants and desires of the fighters stacking up against one another, fighting to claw their ways forward in this unforgiving tournament. There wasn\u2019t a single fight I didn\u2019t enjoy in Megalo Box \u2013 some were a lot weaker, usually against low-level, basically mob characters, but fights against greats like Aragaki and Mikio are exciting affairs since they almost always seem like having just as much of a chance of winning as Joe, and in some cases like Aragaki, you almost want them to triumph over him.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes down to it, unlike many other sport-based shows I watch, I actually enjoyed the development between the fights even more then the fights themselves. Every fight is built up spectacle, since you really get to know most of the fighters prior to their brawls, which feeds into why I care just as much about them as Joe himself. Each fight build-up raises the stakes and tightens the noose around Joe and Nanbu\u2019s neck amazingly, but there\u2019s more to it then this; we see more of why Joe needs to do to this, get more glimpses of just how broken and desperate Nanbu is as he grapples with the amazingly creepy Fujisaki, and encounters Aragaki again. Rather than having back-to-back fights, just about all of them have time to breath and let us know what\u2019s one the line, and without them, this would be a much weaker show. \\n\\n\r\nJust about every major character feels unique and distinct from one another, design and idea-wise, and even at just a glance you can get an idea of what they\u2019re like; Joe\u2019s frustration with his day-to-day grind, Nanbu\u2019s desperation to pay of his debts at any cost, and perhaps most distinctly at all, the unease and worry that rises in the show every time Fujimaki appears (or hell, the fear when his name is even mentioned). By the time this show was done, I\u2019d fallen in love with a good proportion of the cast, perhaps most of all Nanbu \u2013 his development might be among the best of any character this year, and is easily the best in the show, but I couldn\u2019t forget about the others; Aragaki and Mikio\u2019s character arcs made me care about them a lot, and even Joe, who can be a little boring and frustrating sometimes, got me cheering for him in some of his most exciting fights. I didn\u2019t care for everyone \u2013 Sachio and Yukiko never really endeared themselves in my eyes, but that\u2019s not to say they\u2019re bad characters, just not ones I care about. But at the end of the day, in Megalo Box, every character feels like they matter, and I very rarely had a moment where I felt \u2018oh man, here comes THAT guy!\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be briefly going into spoilers for this part of my review, part of which will detail a crucial portion of the final bout, so skip ahead to the next paragraph if you want to stay unspoiled. I\u2019m frustrated, since Megalo Box got so close to being cemented as one of my favourites, but a few elements really held it back from that. My biggest complaint was the pretty early decision for Joe to go without his Gear as his gimmick to climb the ladder in Megalonia \u2013 as a plot decision, it made sense to me, but I was really excited to see him tamper and push his Gear to the very limit to overcome some of the amazingly crazy Gears he comes up against. Secondary, and this is somewhat related, is the elements of the final brawl between Joe and Yuri \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing fight, among the best in the show, but the fact that Joe fights without his Gear leads to Yuri powering himself down (in more ways than one, which I won\u2019t spoil) to remove his Gear takes away from a lot of the build-up to the fight, and makes the conclusion feel a lot more half-assed. It has some amazing characterisation tied to the decision, but I think it takes a lot from the fight.\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box is simply an amazing ride \u2013 it\u2019s got an aesthetic like little else in this era where about half the shows look about the same, and it looks superb, and characters that really feel like they belong in this broken, decaying world. It\u2019s not without its problems \u2013 I feel like it made some promises about the fights that weren\u2019t really delivered, but it\u2019s not enough to ruin it \u2013 I really grew attached to the world and everyone in it, and just about every fight has a hype factor that just grows as the show progresses. Megalo Box utterly captivated me as a show like nothing else that season, and it\u2019ll be one that I\u2019ll be going back to in the future, without a doubt.\\n",

I like the resolve of Joe and how Nanbu, Gansaku was his coach and was determined to make Joe fight to the top, the series is short but sweet and is exciting, the show introduces unique characters from Sachio who is a supporting character who travels with Nanbu,Gansaku and Joe he is a kid who has a interesting pass and has a reason to support the boxer Joe, Joe is a underdog and he fights to prove himself worthy to get to the top.\\n\\n\r\n Gear less Joe FTW",

            "content": "A successful homage to anime of year's past.\r\nStory: 6\r\nAs you might be able to tell from the synopsis, this is basically your typical plucky underdog story. Nothing spectacular but no major missteps along the way. It does introduce a semi-interesting gimmick early on, but I don't have a ton to say about the story. It was ok. \r\nArt: 9\r\nIf you think this looks a bit different than most current anime, you'd be right. The art is very obviously inspired by 80s and 90s anime. There is a certain grit to it that really sets the mood for the show. This is a rough world tolive in, especially so from the main character's perspective. The only tiny complaint I had was the actually Megalo boxing matches were not quite as visually stunning as I would've hoped.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe strength of the show. While the OP/ED weren't anything too spectacular, the music in between was consistently phenomenal and not only set the mood, but enhanced scenes. The main theme is something I never tire of. I can't say I was blown away by a single performance, but the voice acting was at least competent, if not good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe only reason this isn't a 9 or 10 is the complete lack of backstory of the main character, at least in this anime. I have not seen \"Ashita no Joe\", the 50 year old how they are paying homage to, so maybe they're assuming you have. You know the MC does not have citizenship or a name (he's the one who names himself \"Joe\"), and because of that throws Megalo matches for money, but that's it. In contrast, the rest of the cast are given, for the most part, very interesting backstories. In particular, Joe's rival, Yuuri, and his trainer's former disciple, Aragaki, are superb. So much so that the latter is really main character material. I don't want to spoil anything, but he has had some serious demons to deal with since returning from war, and they don't really sugarcoat it. And even his aforementioned rival, Yuuri, slowly grows on you as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI was a bit late to the party, and watched all 13 episodes in a single day. I think that's a good indicator of my enjoyment. It's a series dripping with style and has a unique vibe. I won't say it's a modern day Cowboy Bebop, but it's probably the closest thing we've seen to that since Samurai Champloo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIt's not too long and as long as you're not expecting anything too grand story-wise, I doubt you'll be disappointed. So yeah, watch it.",

            "content": "Megalo Box - The Genuine Article\r\nWhat is the real deal? Over the years as an anime fan, Modern anime has given me lots to cherish. I've seen some good ones, bad ones, great ones, instant classics. Looking back, anime this decade can even be argued to be anime's golden age considering how diverse and consistent the products are and in this digital era, anime production is at an all time high in terms of efficiency and animation can be enhanced through means such as CGI, 3D technology and particle effects and the market is diverse enough to sell anything from lust to gore. But howgood is it really, when it is stripped off everything. In it's rawest form, does it still manage to deliver a level of quality set by classics and pioneers? Such is not the mockery but also the challenge taken up by Megalo Box, An anime original that was made to pay tribute to boxing classic - 'Ashita no Joe' on it's 50th Anniversary, And I dare say, it succeeds at doing just that.\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box has been one of the standout's of Spring 2018, which was crowded with anticipated anime and popular hits, But Megalo Box immediately managed to stand out and get the attention of the viewers, quickly becoming the #1 anime original of the season. An underdog in every way, this anime was not even released in HD (intentionally), there was no fanservice or any other desperate gimmicks for the show to gain viewership. You could argue that the vintage art style and sound were gimmicky enough to set it apart from other modern anime but just like \"Gearless\" Joe himself who started off as a bluff and became the real deal, anything that this anime started off as gimmick genuinely became an integral part of what the show is. It is not just a tribute to the older anime, but it's wants the viewer to know, making a strong statement - \"I am the real deal\".\\n\\n\r\nI was sold within the first five minutes of watching Megalo Box. Upon starting this, in it's opening scene it immediately introduces us to three of it's biggest attributes - A badass underdog MC, The vintage SD art style and what is probably my most favorite thing about this show - The music. Me being a huge fan of Hip Hop, I could really appreciate how good these instrumentals were and it compliments the style of the anime and the superb editing and framework of this show. There were a few times where they actually rapped in Japanese as well, which I thought was fresh as fuck. The setting, music and art style reminded me of anime like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun. Apart from being a 50th anniversary tribute to Ashita no Joe, I think it can also be considered a tribute to Cowboy Bebop and Trigun as they celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2018.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is a normal but gritty tale about the rise of an underdog boxer who is looking for a tough opponent to get serious with. What makes it so interesting are the characters and the way in which it is executed. They don't bore us with unnecessary backstory and flashbacks wasting precious screen time on it to drag the show. It's short and to the point, focusing more about what drives the characters and the interesting parallels between them. The second half of the anime features some good plot twists as well. The dialogues were solid, there were so many amazing quotables that you can find throughout the show. Even the fights, I guess some would have complaints in this area considering the fights were always pretty short, often anticlimatic and surely no the best choreography that you will see. Some might even say that the main character wore plot armors at times which I think can be argued but for the most part I was glad that they didn't go the usual route of extremely long, dramatic and dragged out fights. Instead we got fights that were short, meaningful and intense in the moment stuff that play well into the heart of the story. I look at it as something like Ping Pong the Animation, where the sport takes a backseat to the parallels and what it actually means to the characters. They were real, relatable, inspiring and well written, especially the character Aragaki, the soldier. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say his character really hits home. The amount of realness and emotion that they bring to the screen with him is simply one of the high points of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box is a combination of so many great things that play into why not a moment in this anime was boring to me. I think it certainly deserves all the success that comes along it's way. It was a very enjoyable short anime and I'm not sure when we will something in this format again, something that is of such high quality in it's rawest form, I definitely hope it inspires other anime to do so. I usually like to give my thoughts about an anime as soon as I finish it, but with this, I decided to just sit with thoughts for a couple of days and deeply appreciate what I had witnessed, cause I know what I had witnessed was the real deal.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

Consuming a product that feels so close to home, yet so far from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was really nice. The megalo gear, all had their own unique design, they were not all just the same gear. Also, they looked badass.\\n\r\nThe characters all had a unique art style and presentation as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound just worked for the show. From the rap to the silence, to the cheering, it all managed to just work. I love the \"hood\" rap from Japan, and if it is used right, it is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were chezy, and unique.

            "content": "Story & Sound: 8 & 10, respectively\r\n\"Ah, he who has and he who has not\r\nA man rising up to try and take another's spot\r\nAh, the pretender and the crown, \r\nFake or real? Which one is going down?\r\nAh, two animals going wild out there,\r\nFreedom and soul, the only things they share\r\nAh, this is where they wanna be \r\nA pair of predators, about to be set free.\"\r\nFirst off, I want to review Megalo Box's story along with its sound, because to me, Megalo Box's soundtrack is so intertwined with its identity and aesthetic that I cannot consider the two as separate entities.\r\nMegalo Box pulls off everything itwants to do with flair and confidence. It is more than just an homage to the monumental Ashita no Joe; from the very first episode Megalo Box had already taken off as its own stylish and unique story, with a gritty cyberpunk-ish hip-hop aesthetic. Here's where this anime's soundtrack comes in: hip-hop and pop with a little rap and electronic flair. Try to recall a time when hip-hop was not just a musical genre but a social movement, a battle cry of a generation of young adults living in impoverished suburban areas. Now try to imagine the kind of imagery you would see in an 80's hip-hop/rap music video, from the \"ghettos\", to \"life in the hood\", to poverty, to violence, and most importantly, to defiance. Why did I bring all this up? Because this is exactly the kind of imagery Megalo Box's soundtrack evokes for me; I felt like I was watching a 4 hour long underground hip-hop music video, complete with some youth rapping about \"making it in the game,\" about hustling and earning respect, and someday becoming someone bigger. Needless to say, I absolutely loved every moment of it. Thematically, I can't think of anything that goes with Megalo Box's classic underdog \"came from the mud\" story and slum setting better than hip-hop, with its defiant undertones and history with impoverished communities. In other words, Megalo Box's soundtrack makes its story that much more funky, expressive, and empowering. Truly a match made in heaven.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we have the show's thematic associations out of the way, let's move on to the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any good sports series, half of the story takes place outside of the sport itself. Just like Hajime no Ippo, Megalo Box pulls off the character drama outside the boxing ring beautifully. The story is very realistic in that the shady pasts of our main cast follows them throughout the entire show, and their struggles are not just confined to the fistfights inside the ring, but also the outside. The audience is constantly reminded that Junk Dog and co. are not heroes, but rather, a bunch of frauds who managed to crawl their way up from the bottom. Almost each and every episode of Megalo Box is rife with suspense and cliffhangers, as getting inside the ring is just as difficult as winning a fight in it. Why an 8 out of 10 then, if the story is so good, you ask? Well, keep reading.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box's characters are immediately likeable and sympathetic. Right off the bat, Junk Dog is a classic underdog protagonist that is the staple of so many great shounen stories. But what seperates Junk Dog from Naruto or that screaming twat from Black Clover is that he acts like a mature adult. He doesn't scream \"I WILL BECOME HOKAGE !!1!1!\" nor does he act like a buffoon to gain attention and acknowledgement. Instead, he comes off as a relatable human being who's struggling to find a purpose in life, to find something that thrills him and spurs him to keep on living. This struggle is exemplified by the first few minutes of episode one, where he, either consciously or unconsciously, drove his bike through an open wasteland and straight off a cliff, possibly to find some excitement, some emotional stimulus in what is an otherwise pointless and unsatisfying life a fraud who throws matches in an underground ring for a living. One thing I can't give the show enough credit for is that it understands what \"show, not tell\" is. Much of Junk Dog's character is revealed through his actions and habits, and the same can also be said for Megalo Box's solid cast of side characters, including the troubled boxing coach Nanbu, the urchin Sachio, and the prideful Yuri. Almost every single one of them will grow and develop throughout the course of the story, but since there's only 13 episodes to spare, something had to give, and that something was the boxing matches themselves, which leads me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nThe boxing matches are definitely lackluster.\\n\r\nI've been spoiled by Hajime no Ippo, with its ultra intense balls-to-the-wall mind game boxing matches, each stretched over the span of a few episodes. Megalo Box, however, due to its short episode count, has to resolve most matches within one episode max. The shortest matches can be as short as half an episode. There is a lot of tension and potential for development lost here, as most fights are usually over way too fast. This makes for some very underwhelming and anti-climactic fights, where a single punch from Junk Dog will just suddenly end everything. These are by no means Fairy Tail/ Naruto level \"power of friendship/never give up\" asspulls, but damn if they don't come pretty close sometimes. It's a real shame, because if these fights were anywhere near the level of Hajime no Ippo's insane fights, The story would get at least a 9/10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMegalo Box utilizes a traditional animation style, with pure sakuga and an old-school coloring style the likes you'd see in an anime recorded on VHS tape. It's an extremely refreshing nostalgia trip, a nice change of pace from the bog-standard modern animation style of most shows nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA very unique and fun experience. Loved the rap and hip-hop. The short episode count drags the quality of the fights down though. A lot more fun could have been had with the fights, but then again, at the end of the day, even if the payoff aka the fights is lackluster, the buildup to them aka the character drama is great enough to warrant an 8/10 in enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8/10. On the surface, Megalo Boxing is a classic underdog story that uses boxing as its catalyst for the protagonist Joe. From episode 1, you can probably predict how the show will end.\r\nHowever, Megalo Boxing is truly a show that's about the journey and not the destination. The characters' journeys, and the twists and turns that make their way through the show, all enrich the show to a great degree. I don't see this show as a boxing anime. I think Megalo Boxing is a show that uses boxing to enhance its characters, their struggles and their beliefs.\r\nThe show suffers from pacing problems atsome parts, but nothing too detrimental. Whatever needs emphasis is given its due focus, and nothing important is really overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. I think a lot of people find the artwork bad because it's rough and gritty, but this was a stylistic choice to match the rough atmosphere of the show. Joe is an underdog who rises up from the dirt to claw his way to victory, and the show isn't meant to be a clean, painless journey. The artwork gives off the impression that the Megalo Box world is one that cannot be easily traversed, and it really adds to Joe's struggles as he tries to make his name.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, the boxing falls flat at times but it does a well enough job. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The OST will get you PUMPED. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. You can't expect a lot of development from the characters in 13 episodes, but the show does a great job given its time limit. Side characters are given enticing, believable backstories and motivations that make every match engaging and meaningful. More over, the main cast of Joe, Nanbu and Sacchi each have their own personal problems that they work with and overcome throughout the course of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was a character I didn't really like in the show, it would be the President. She seems rather one-dimensional and I don't really see any development come from her during the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I binged this show over the course of 2 days. It was fun from start to finish and had an emotional quality I didn't really expect while watching it. I'm definitely going to be rewatching this show in the near future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. A truly great show that I'll be recommending to others. Joe is a character you want to win. He is a character that struggles to find himself, but through Megalo Boxing he and others are able to find what truly matters to them.\\n\\n\r\nSome might be disappointed that this isn't the next Hajime no Ippo, but I think both shows strive to do different things. Hajime no Ippo is a great boxing anime that adds depth to its matches by expanding on the characters and their motivations. Megalo Box is an underdog story where its protagonists and other characters strive to find themselves: this process occurs through boxing. Both are great, but I don't like that people are putting down Megalo Boxing because it's not the next Hajime no Ippo. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, stellar show!",

Yet it's only sort of about this thematically. It all falls apart, to be honest. With little sense of catharsis, or pointed non-catharsis.\r\nThe work ultimately proves to have spent all of its interesting ideas about half way through. Much of the characters' development finishes by thispoint, and much of the exploration of the past or any greater context for any of the conflict falls away too. The character designs are slick, the soundtrack is good (if small), and the animation firmly in the \"okay\" category.\\n\\n\r\nNot even that much else to say, really. Check out the first couple episodes, feel free to tap out if/when it loses your interest. People won't be talking about this one five years from now.",

            "content": "You don't need to die once just to throw everything down the drain despite your previous convictions.  If you still have others by your side, the opportunity is still in front of you or coming another day, or you're on the floor breathing and losing consciousness, until you decide to walk away from the ring, you are NOT DEAD YET.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nMegalo Box is a basic underdog tale following a nobody who carries on as a piece of dirt only to survive in the underground.  But the execution portraying a man who decides to choose a different path despite all the winds blowing againsthim all for the reason of just trying to be something that he has no idea he could be capable of is inspiring.  Following in the footsteps of other previous works such as Ashita no Joe and Hajime no Ippo (both highly recommend), Megalo Box approaches a similar journey but has less of a complex pathway for the series only lasts 1 tournament.  But the complexity of the sport itself is still existent for Joe, the main character, not only discovers his true potential and the pain that is gone through to reach the top.  He also encounters his opponent's different ideals for fighting, what keeps them going after a harsh past, the people in their world who they claim to fight for, and the luxury they give up once they realize that victory itself is not the treasure a true athelete fights for.  The conflict of also fighting against the corrupt industry that tries to control Joe and his coach and child sidekick also displays that continues to grow throughout the series and how much development they go through to chase after dream of climbing to the top even if they they started lower than the bottom.\\n\r\nMy only complaint for the story would be that the final episode was rushed despite a satisfying ending fight and that some episodes that weren't focused on a match were dragged because it was following a formulaic pattern.  The episodes outside the ring were effective ways to build and flesh out the characters (which also occurs in the ring as well) but some scenes felt a bit pointless just for the purpose of keeping the match in one episode and the time inbetween exclusively in the following episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe cast was good but I would not go all the way to strong.  Nanbu, the coach, was my favorite character about how he begins the series being content with just throwing fights for money to money has not power over my player and we will fight our way to the top, or die trying.  From a con-man to almost like a father, Nanbu had the most dynamic conviction as is a viable candidate for best male supporting character of 2018.  Sachio also has a growing sense of development from being someone who hated the concept of Megalo boxing and not having faith in Joe into someone who, like Nanbu, won't figure out the answer until they become the champions or fail.  All of Joe's opponents also had splendid more motivations for fighting whether it was following the dream of someone you looked up to, fighting against post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or believing that victory never was the dream because the underdog is gaining more just from being a first-timer.  They are all very well fleshed out and while not memorable, they make their mark on the series and the Team Nowhere would not be who they are if it wasn't for any of them.\\n\r\nIf you noticed that I haven't praised the main character, Joe, then you may be disappointed to hear that he was the weakest aspect in the whole show.  I can respect the heart he has, his drive for being somebody else, and his determination to keep getting up and leaving behind the past of needing gear.  What makes him the least dynamic character was that he is the only character that seems to have remained the same from beginning to end.  His main conflict was taking down one fighter so he can meet the next but I didn't feel any growth from him personally and because he is the titular character of the series, it felt as if he put in the least amount of work when carrying the series unlike all of those around him.  He still has his honor when learning about his troubles and how Nanbu gets in his way every now and then but I felt as if this show lost some potential just for having a lead character who was not generic but too basic.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art may turn off those who are used to the colorful and vibrant animation that is now modern anime.  But its retro art compliments the gritty vibe of living in a society where one fights for his life.  One loss and its all over.  The pixelated aspects give a more nostalgic feel even when introducing a futuristic society where technology has advanced even farther for human capability yet there still exists slums and dangerous neighborhoods where people partake in illegal activity just to live another day.  But lets talk about the fights.  The animation is sold for the most part but the fights are where the animation truly shines, correct?  I'd say yes and no.  The fights were well-animated but do lack the epicness and extra push that were given to series such as Hajime no Ippo.  But does that make the fight more realistic?  Yes, in fact.  The dull (to an extent) action of continuous punches or straight blocking the face makes the fight realistic in a sense that every second matters in a match and boxers have to be quick on their feet and fists to lock even just one hit to put themselves ahead of their opponent.  I was more expecting dynamic fights in the beginning but the uneventful spiting of multiple punches and little time for strategizing makes the atmosphere gritty the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not going to praise the opening for I think it's lackluster even without the visuals.  But the sound of every punch hit, every swing, every footstep, every grunt of pain keeps the audience absorbed into the show.  The sounds are also well put together which makes every action feel well-choreographed and planned out.\\n\r\nOh and did I ever mention Sachio's rap skills.  That kid sure spits fire and the resolve excites the audience to an appealing and lit degree.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR\\n\r\nPros +\\n\r\n- All opponents and Nanbu were dynamic and had engrossing pasts that built believable motivations\\n\r\n- Fights were dully animated (for the better) and brought upon the grittyness of a real boxing match even with aiding attachments\\n\r\n- Retro art gives a nostalgic feel even when taking place in the future\\n\\n\r\nCons -\\n\r\n- Joe was a little too two-dimensional for the lead character\\n\r\n- The pacing is too patterned prioritizing one episode to fight and one episode exactly to build character\\n\r\n- The final episode was rushed\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said and done, the series did have more potential, but you'd be wrong to say there was nothing the audience could gain from the experience of watching Megalo Box and is still more than worth your while watching.  I give Megalo Box a 7/10.",

A well drawn, coordinated, aesthetically pleasing, boxing anime from the creators of Ashita no Joe. \r\nStory: Although this has its interesting elements to it, i find many things not making any sense. First of all, normal boxing itself already injures a person pretty badly. I would only imagine the \"gear\" to decapitate one's head. Secondly, presuming the fact that gear enhances the power a little bit, I would assume here that Joe would have been brutally battered without gear. 7/10\r\nArt: The CG is barely noticeable but very effective with the camera angles and scenery. The facial expressions and the land mass altogether areso well drawn, I can't help but fawn over it. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Who doesn't like some hip hop, rap beats once in a while? Its so well coordinated with the fights and practices its as if its in sync. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It might just be me, but i find that the protagonist seems really cliched among all the other anime out there. His coach seems like a typical drunkard/gambler, so nothing interesting there either. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Despite not all things making sense, the stunning art combined with some epic music, mashed with boxing is really enjoyable for me. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a wrap!",

This delivers that classic feel of Ashita No Joe, but with a level of excitement and pacing more common in new 12/24 episode seasonal shounen. People that dislike this anime either hate fun or  dislike underdog stories. Of course the plot and conclusion were obviousto fans of the genre. Megalo Box is a homage to Ashita and other *heavyweights*. Other than the poorly handled rapping introduced towards the end, the execution was flawless.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style looks nearly authentic to 80/90s anime without hitting the uncanny valley.\\n\\n\r\nThe song selection is solid, and the music throughout fits the mood. Once again minus the rapping (my only real gripe).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a great send-off to the boxing anime before it and a great indicator of whether or not you should go back and watch some of those old boxing classics. If you enjoyed this then check out Ashita No Joe and Hajime No Ippo. If you've already seen both then try getting Fisted by the North Star.",

Its a \"very good\" anime, the characters are pretty static, most motivations are vanilla but interesting enough to keep you watching.\r\nMy enjoyment and intrigue kept me through the end but the end was disappointing to me because it had this huge build to one moment, you've been waiting for it since the firstepisode and, like i said earlier, it just doesn't pop.  It doesn't have that \"we made it\" moment in my opinion.

But I'm glad that I didn't wait because this one was actually pretty good!\r\nSo, the story is basically about Joe and, later, his last opponent being able to live in the moment and experience that one event that they, up until a certain point, didn't know that they were waiting for. The way the story weaved in those themes is basically flawless and I love that. Each episode is closely connected because it's simplyJoe's journey to Megalonia. This also includes some additional information about the characters he comes across. Each fight is nice to watch but, somehow, lacking in intensity so it decreases the enjoyment a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked the characters as well for the most part. Joe, Nanbu, and Sachio are very likable characters. Joe wants to get into Megalonia, Nanbu wants to see him get there, and Sachio is the kid they meet who supports them in more ways than one. Along the way, they meet other characters who have their fair share of development. The less important ones...not so much. I think even Yukiko got some development thanks to the backstory and her relationship with Yuuri. Speaking of him, he also changed a lot. He's mysterious but we learn little bits and pieces about him through backstory and his interactions with other characters. Basically, most of the characters are interesting and/or likable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really nice looking. The characters all look cool but the environment and background is what really stands out. Everything just feels so urban (despite the location) and that's not a feeling you get with most anime. The animation is great as well. I don't remember a single awkward movement.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like the sound. I wasn't a big fan of the opening song but it fits Joe so I don't mind it. I prefer the ending song though. The soundtrack is just amazing. I love when they incorporate rap into the anime. Any other dramatic or exciting music was well timed.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime.

Coupled with a goodcharacter construction for a series of 13 episodes, the final package boils down to a work of art not to be missed, whether you are fond of boxing or not.\\n",

The anime also has a very likeable charecters with some reasonable and relatable goals. This show was also able to build very high tension in important sense and my heart still is racing after finishing it. It was very good, it did everything pretty much right in my opionion. The one small complantis that the charecters could have more detail into their backstories, but the mystery of almost every charecter also makes it more exiting.

            "content": "Megalo Box can only be described as an underrated show of its time. Swept away by titles both inside and outside its season, the show drifted away without any recognition or talk. But with all around great direction from its narrative to music and to art, I find that it at least deserves some spotlight for its efforts. It\u2019s got everything you can ask for in a contemporary show with hip-hop, a gray color gradient pallet, and a dystopian society. It\u2019s a great show to watch for not only its appeal but its engaging use of animationand environment. \\n\r\n\tThe show tends to focus on the world around it far more than you can notice and the way it accomplishes that is its immaculate animation choice. With hardline sketches making up the bulk of its background and foreground it's hard to not appreciate the amount of worn look the scenes have especially when it comes to the wide shots. Being able to not only show but have the world breath its rough look is quite impressive, and it becomes a match made in heaven. Along with this, there is another equally impressive pallet of washouts to accommodate the world. Some might find a lack of color to be offsetting, but I believe it fits the show nicely with its dystopian setting and environment. It also mixes well with the type animation used as it\u2019s not a style that would benefit well with a more expressive color gradient. The show does suffer at some points with its constant quality outside important scenes in far background movement, but this comes with the technical hurdle that is caused by the choice of animation and it this problem that is rarely seen throughout the show. The show isn\u2019t afraid to get serious with its animation in fights and it switches paces fast with-it becoming streamlined and smooth in some frames while retaining the same art style in others, showing how adaptable it can be. Having a solid a grasp on animation is always a nice beginning especially when it comes to showcasing the narrative. \\n\r\n\tThe story prides itself on the underdog trope that is used very often in similar works. While it has been saturated of late, I still find myself attracted to its message and excitement. Rooting for someone as they attempt the impossible is always an uplifting emotion and reminds us that there is nothing truly impossible. The core of Megalo Box is no different with knowing exactly what the audience wants and how to accomplish it. Joe is the epitome of this purity and reflects on deeply with the other side characters as he travels on his heroes\u2019 journey. Every major character he comes across has some major flaw in them that is ultimately impacted by their interaction with Joe. Maybe they see him as what they used to be or maybe they see him for what they could be, but every character is dramatically developed over their prospective arcs. It\u2019s the characterization of the cast that is what gets me so involved in the fights. It\u2019s not just Joe that I\u2019m intrigued about but his opponent as well. It drives those emotional conflicts to a new level and gets me fired up every time a new person comes around. The only weakness in this plan is Joe himself. While the progression of his character isn\u2019t weak per se it\u2019s not greatly accelerated like the other characters he meets. The main character should be the focus of change in the story and while developing the side characters is also important it shouldn\u2019t be the only thing developing. The scenes are also not complete in climax without a pretty killer soundtrack that accompanies them.  \\n\r\n\tThe great animation and narrative synergize well with its impactful soundtrack. Composing of mostly character and emotion driven pieces the songs really reflect what\u2019s going on screen. I really like the theme pieces of the score because of how tided they are to the involvement of the characters. The side characters explained previously wouldn\u2019t have been as flushed out if it wasn\u2019t for these pieces. There\u2019s a lot of nuances with these songs like the theme for Yukiko Shirato and the expectations that she needs to meet and where she is at in the story with being the creator of the Megalo boxing tournament. The spaced melody allows for her high air around here and portraying her above the rest. The theme for Yuri is just as interesting with its very simple barebones harmony to try and rely on the superior and slickness about him. All the themes of the score having accompanying variations for the different moments the perspective characters are in. I also enjoyed other engaging songs like the slums and Drive. The composer mabanua was very thoughtful with how he was wanting to add to the characters and it paid off handsomely. \\n\r\n\tMegalo box is the spiritual successor to Rocky. With an impeccable combination of its animation, sound, and narrative it felt like the action was right in front of you and you could follow it all the way. The show is right up there with some of the best of 2018 with its underrated popularity, it really deserves more praise. Currently available for streaming at Crunchyroll and a licensed dub done by Viz media. I highly recommend checking out the show for being one of the gems of 2018. \\n",

            "content": "Will contain spoilers.\r\nAs is often the case nowadays, even a lot of sub par anime still get a good art direction. So along with that, let's cover this positive site first, shall we? The anime is drawn in an unusual, gritty, yet appealing style. The music and atmosphere are pretty good. Buut.. That is all.\r\nMegalo box. What is it? If box is for boxing, what is the 'megalo' part? Well, in this post war universe, that looks like a third world country, with the elite living in luxury (as is often the case), it is PLOT. Basically, it is a boxing tournament that is usedboth for gaining money via gambling, a world wide flashy show, brand, and a stage to try new technology in. Thechnology? In boxing? Yes, you heard it right, the participants use what is essentially an enhancing exoskeleton called 'gear' to take boxing from the brutal slug fest it is to.. ... Nowhere? That's right, i almost forgot, so i'll remind you, both this tournament and the 'gears' are purely cosmetic items in this universe, to be used as little more than plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, 'Joe', or more fittingly, Johnny macrubberface is described as a wild dog, unable to find any meaning to his life other than the thrill of standing against all odds and impossible opponents. After being done with his life as a sellout boxer in the underworld, he and his coach Mr. gamblyeye (who's at first opposed as his life is on the line, not that our 'hero' cares) quit and gun for the megalo tournament with a fake name as someone from the streets can't enter. Being flat out broke, they can't afford a gear, and so, our protagonist enters bare-handed, earning him the nickname 'gearless Joe' what becomes his brand.. Thank god those gears are just cosmetic items~\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is by far my biggest beef with the show - the anime's whole selling point is the unusual setting, but in the end, it turns out as purely cosmetic, there's no extra threat from someone nearly twice your mass throwing a punch at you in a EXOSKELETON SUIT that adds even more weight and speed into the punches, (almost) no one dies, breaks bones or gets disfigured (not that i'd want that, but then what's the point of the gears to begin with, other than to give plot (as it later does, due to shady stuff going behind the scenes with the top gear developers)?)... It all falls flat. In the end they even drop the 'gears' for a 'fair fight' between the rivals, and nothing changes in the animation from when gears where involved...\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, the story is pretty much the classic underdog seen everywhere. The gears add no extra weight or meaning to the fights in most cases. The story is pretty shallow, illogical and inconsistent. In the end, not a bad show, and probably worth a watch... But nothing new, special nor amazing.",

            "content": "Megalo Box has a pretty simple premise going for it. Boxing with \"Gear\" that heightens the action by strengthening the boxers wearing it.\r\nThe sound design is the best thing going for this anime, the punches are crisp, the footwork is slick and streaky, and the soundtrack does a great job of setting the mood.\r\nThe Story and characters are the weakest point though. They aren't terrible but fair enough to keep me interested. The story is all about Junk Dog AKA \"Gearless\" Joe rising to the top of this insane Megalo Box federation thing. He's the most consistent character. His Coach/Partner, Nanbu, is pretty inconsistent whichI found a little frustrating. You think he's a scumbag at first and then he changes his ways and is a good guy for a bit, but then he's a scumbag again until he isn't. Sachio is pretty inconsistent too in what he does and wants, but he's a kid so that fit him thematically at least. The rest of the characters are kind of inconsequential to this review as they aren't the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style hearkens back to shows like Cowboy Bebop, or Wolf's Rain. It's got that older look, which really worked for the setting and feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a fun boxing anime, which is what I came to watch. If you've got an open slot in your anime schedule give this one a shot.",

            "content": "I enjoyed it very much, actually, but if I were to be objective I think I found the anime to just be fair quality overall. I thought to myself whether I would recommend it to anybody I know who likes anime, and the truth is I don't really know. I would have a pretty wishy-washy answer. \r\nIt's somewhat worth seeing when it comes to the greater middle parts of the series, where it builds the conflicts (or I guess, arcs) pretty well, but at the starting two episodes I thought the anime suffered from some pretty stupid flaws, mainly based on its premise. Without spoiling,the aspect of \"Gears\" in the show that make up Megalo Boxing is not really comprehensive, and it struck me personally as kind of pointless by the time it got to the last stretch of the series. But I don't know if it came across that way to most others.\\n\\n\r\nReally my basis for recommendation of the anime just comes from whether the person is like me and is more discerning with art and visuals (coming from a background in fine art and disciplined drawing). The series is unusually solid in the art department, the characters are constructed super well, and they feel sculpted enough to not come off as cheap. This feels pretty close to the animation quality in the fucking 90s? I was pleasantly surprised. I know it's going to sound like I'm tunneling here, but with these visuals I feel pretty entertained in and of itself. The only thing that wasn't my personal taste was probably the art direction and color design- I don't want to dismiss it as \"drab\", but without better terms for it, it was sort of...that, but with more credit given where credit is due. :)\\n\\n\r\nThe aesthetics were backed by fairly simple and okay characters and story, I think that's the overall impression I am left with in the end, without getting too nitty gritty with the details- because then I would just go on all day looking for things to discuss more critically. Try it out, if you want something easy and decent. I'll be able to remember parts from this one for sure.",

            "content": "Grab your popcorn, get comfy, and prepare for an EPIC SHOW.\r\nHonestly, I was very skeptical from the beginning, mainly due to the a very unapologetic vintage looking art style that looks like cowboy bebop and trigun. I have to say this now: DON'T GET TURNED OFF BY THE ART AND ANIMATION. I have to admit, the art didn't really get any better...it is a brand new studio so it was evident that they didn't have a lot o f budget to work with. The animation was NOT consistent at all. However, I have to give credit to the studio for making the important scenes lookgood. There was a couple of shots where I was genuinely impressed (the steam rising off of JOE got me SO HYPED), but I have to admit that the art and animation was not the best. The boxing matches could have been animated so much better, but in the end I didn't watch Megalo box because of the boxing matches, so...\\n\\n\r\nOff that note, the story of this series is not the strongest either. Its not particularly original nor is it extremely complex (it is really straight forward and painfully simple) but the writing for the show as a whole WAS AMAZING. There was a lot of goosebump scenes in this series. There was also just the right amount of symbolism. The dialogues were well done, and although Megalo Boxwas short, I feel like I got a very wholesome story with well developed. I though the pacing was perfect. I was never bored, nor thought the writers were rushing the story at anypoint. Most importantly, this 13 episode show had a GOOD, FULFILLING ENDING. Thank GOD. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this show for me is the characters and their relationships. Boy, I love Joe. I freakin' love him. Again he is a pretty simple character, but to me Joe is super likable. He's honest, straightforward, and definitely caring. He is loyal to his own desires. \\n\r\nI also love Yuri.He is not your typical \"HAHA i'm the strongest, fight me when you're good enough\" kind of guy (even though he seems like that at first, but keep watching and you'll dismiss that judgement) \\n\r\nWhat Joe and Yuri had at the end was SO BEAUTIFUL. This type of chivalry and camaraderie brought tears to my eyes. really. I knew that because I didn't give two shits about who won the final. I was just crying tears of joy during the entire scene because the two got to fight each other, fair and square. T_T\\n\r\nI was also glad that there was more to Nanbu than just a fraud. That man got so much character development. Also the best mentor award definitely goes to Nanbu.\\n\r\nSachio! That kid has Naruto-level speech skills. Without his mouth, it would have been OVER for Joe and Nanbu a long time ago. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Sachio, can we just STOP and APPRECIATE HIS RAPS???!!!! Like honestly all the tracks in this dang show is so good! It's got a similar feel to the tracks from Devilman Crybaby. Like I love my Yuki Kaijura and Hiroyuki Sawano, but this was equally awesome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the only reason why this didn't  get a 10 is because of the things it COULD have done to be even better. In addition to art and animation, I felt like some of the other characters could have been a little more flushed out, for example Shirato, and maybe more background and Yuki pre-Shirato. But that's just me being nitpicky. Enjoyment wise, it was like a 10000000++++. As someone who also boxes, this was amazing. I said I didn't come for the matches, but that wasn't in the sense that I didn't LIKE the boxing. Sure it wasn't very flashy, but it felt pretty real: the *shhh* sound boxers make from punching, the very 'real' moves and combos, and the whole 'spirit' of the sport was captured perfectly. That was why I wasn't upset because the fight scenes weren't animated well enough, because in the end if it was 'super flashy' then perhaps I wouldn't have loved Megalo Box the way I love it now. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am so surprised a show like this was created in the year of 2018. Its a rare f****** gem, so go see it!!!!\\n",

It may not be perfect, but its merits allowed it to connect with me enough that I can look past many of them. \r\nMost of its characters are really simple, along with the story. Its incredibly predictable for the most part as well. Along with this, the artmay look fantastic, but the animation isn't stellar, and some of the fights could look a lot better. But, the thing is, this anime isn't really ABOUT boxing. It has boxing in it, and that is the main driver of the plot, but most of the pleasure from this anime is derived from the character interaction and spectacular execution to a bog standard story path. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me feel so many emotions such as sadness and raw unadulterated hype, which may or may not actually be an emotion, but I don't really care.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has it's problems, and I can see why someone would watch it and not care about it in the slightest. However, this anime worked for me, a person with no interest in boxing, and I have to give it credit for that. I don't even LIKE rap, but those rap scenes were amazing. If you don't like the show, at least listen to the soundtrack, it'll be worth your time.",

            "content": "**This will contain spoilers**\r\nA couple Questions arose after I watched the first ep. of Megalobox. What if someone boxed with no arms and only robo arms. Then, what if someone boxed with no robo arms. It also struck me how dumb and dangerous a no round limit, exoskeleton equipped boxing match would be. But whatever lets get into it. \r\nThe story is pretty interesting. A highly skilled junkyard, nobody, fighter, who throws matches for the money; meets the world champ. The champ reignites the love for boxing in the MC's heart. However, the MC, Joe, has to fight his way to the top of theladder to get a shot at the champ. So omg y'all, it is another sports underdog story. It's simple but effective. \\n\\n\r\nThe design team must have had fun with this show. From the old school hand drawn backgrounds, to the colorful cast with even more colorful boxing gear. Each fighters gear fits their personality perfectly. However, there is some bad CG mixed in and the boxing matches do not have a lot of quality animation to them. Even the last fight. The fight that the show has built up to and dick teased you with, was not good. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really good in this show. The op and ep music is great. There are multiple expository raps throughout the show. Sort of like Devilman: Crybaby.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the ones in every sports anime. The grouchy coach, the plucky underdog, annoying kid sidekick. While this show does have a rather cliche character list, it puts more than enough of a spin on them to make them its own thing. The show is very good at introducing characters and making them interesting. However, the lackluster fights kind of makes it a waste of such good characters. Hope you do not get attached to any non-MC fighter cause they will be around for at most two eps.. \\n\\n\r\nThat problem is where my overall enjoyment of the show takes a hit. Most fights themselves last one episode. Sometimes the show will build up the fight during the previous ep., but then all that will seem like a waste when Joe or the Champ beats them so quickly. I understand that they were limited to 13 eps. but if that were the case then I would have cut out any fighter build up eps. and made the last fight at least 2 eps. long and made it a quality fight. The final fight just seems as paper thin as the rest. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend it simply cause there are not that many decent boxing anime out there. This is an easily bingable show but is almost forgettable once its completed.",

But at the end of the day, it is little more than that: a tribute. \r\nThe biggest fault with this series is that it was only given 13 episodes to tell its story. Fights suffer for it and so does character development. No aspects ever reach the heights of compellingness and grit achieved by Ashita No Joe decades ago despite all of the nods some more subtle than others. \r\nBut what if you don't care about Ashita No Joe? Well, on its own Megalobox is still an enjoyable watch even if you might notice problemswith the pacing and the handling of the 'gear' gimmick (which I wasn't on board with until the tail end of the series). The art and animations are very exciting to watch and the main characters are all endearing in their own way, even little Saicho. \\n\\n\r\nMegalobox achieves what it set out to do, remind people that there is still an audience for these types of stories. 'Manime' is the term I've heard thrown around. If it does nothing more than getting people to watch or read (my preference) the original series or others like it dealing with mature themes then I'm all for it. \\n\\n\r\nWhether a newbie or Ashita No Joe diehard give this series a chance. The characters are very similar (sans Joe) but the story plays out in its own way so there's no harm in watching this first. Just keep your expectations in check.",

The art style is distinct, and you'll either loveit or hate it. Actually, I didn't like it at first, but it kept growing on me as I watched. By the end, I liked it. The soundtrack is really good! The emotional tracks are beautiful, and the hype tracks are epic. The titular theme \"MEGALOBOX\" pops up frequently and is my favorite.

My favorite was Ganbare Genki When i heard that they are doing something special about Ashita no Joe's 50 years anniversary i was really interested about the project. \r\nMegalo Box is something like a re-creation of the 50 year old anime but the story is told in a different modernised way. (The same way as Devilman Crybaby)\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story looks like normal shounen anime where to main characters \"win\" in the end. The main character (Joe) is fighting all kinds of opponents and manages to defeat themvery easy. There is even that rival part syndrome where he is doing everything he can to complete the promise he made with one of the characters (Naruto/Sasuke)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot differences between the old (Ashita no Joe) and Megalo Box but there is one big difference that didn't make me like the anime at all. \\n\r\nWhile Ashita no Joe was more of a psychological (Seinen) anime Megalo Box failed to make it look like a seinen anime and just showed us how guys fight with robot arms...\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound (10/10)\\n\r\nThe art style was magnificent and there is nothing more i would want from it. It had all kind of details including shadows and so on. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is probably one of the best this season and i really enjoyed Joe's fighting theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (8/10) About the characters we can talk a lot about them. Every character has unique personality and goes to a different character development while in Ashita no Joe there wasn't this big character development and was mostly focused on the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n I really enjoyed the art the sound and the characters but i didn't enjoyed it that much. It's just that i wasn't expecting the anime to have so good ending. I was prepared for something worse and was a  little disappointed when it didn't happen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI really like the anime and if you are new to sport/boxing anime this is probably the best anime for you. It has very good art/sound and i would highly recommend it for beginners.",

            "content": "A few months back, I was in the car with a friend. Because we\u2019re massive nerds with barely anything actually important to talk about, I brought up MAL on my phone and looked through the shows airing this spring. While most of the conversation was on big shows like Hero Aca and Steins; Gate Zero, one of the other shows that caught my attention was MEGALOBOX, with its striking black, white and red key art - I\u2019m personally not much of a fan of sports anime, let alone boxing, so I decided I\u2019d watch the first episode of the show and see how things wentfrom there. I ended up watching the first episode a few days after its release, where I immediately regretted waiting a little on it. Not only did MEGALOBOX grace me with one of the finest first episodes of anime I\u2019ve ever seen, but the show continued with the same quality throughout the entirety of its 13 episode run.\\n\r\nMEGALOBOX starts off in a traditional underdog style \u2013 a nameless nobody meets a prideful someone and everything spirals from there, but the way in which it does so is refined through 50 years of intensive practise. The show is a tribute to 50 years since the first appearance of legendary boxing manga Ashita no Joe, produced by the same studio that have clearly come a long way. However, I think that simply comparing MEGALOBOX to its spiritual predecessor is a detriment to it, for the new blood succeeds in ways that simply would have been impossible with technology from years ago. The show aims to emulate an older feel from anime produced back then; purposefully reducing the quality of footage from the show to give the show a near-grainy look that works wonders to the anime\u2019s overall aesthetic. While some may pass off this emulation as a gimmick used to make the show stand out, it contributes far too much to simply be labelled as one and ends up becoming an integral part of the overall composition of the show. One thing that does add greatly to this aesthetic is the incredible music by hip-hop artist mabanua, which mixes pounding, electrical beats with low, emotional piano scores to achieve a higher plane of hype in some of the story\u2019s more crucial moments. The production certainly isn\u2019t afraid to flaunt this soundtrack either, having entire minutes of screentime dedicated to just having some of the show\u2019s vocal tracks playing alongside some of the character\u2019s interactions with each other and the show\u2019s stellar western setting- which in turn, leads me nicely onto talking about the characters themselves.\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s protagonist is \u201cJunk Dog\u201d, a brawler who throws matches for money in the slums along with his boss, Nanbu Gansaku. Around them, in the distance, is the first appearance of Megalonia, an augmented boxing tournament run by Yukiko Shirato, who aims to present her champion boxer as a means to put Shirato Industries at the forefront of the world\u2019s technology. One fateful day, Junk Dog encounters Yukiko \u2013 and her champion, the undefeated Yuri, where the two standoff, eventually leading to an encounter in the ring soon after. Through a mix of the show\u2019s music and art, the characters pop to life and feel developed before you\u2019ve even heard them talk \u2013 see Yuri\u2019s theme from the soundtrack to demonstrate this. However, while this fantastic mix may be great and all, this is boxing; and one area where the show 100% succeeds is in its fights.\\n\r\nIn MEGALOBOX, the fighters compete with augmented strength, using mechanical implements known as \u201cGear\u201d to accelerate their combat effectiveness. While it doesn\u2019t lead to \u201cpowers\u201d of any sorts for the combatants to use, it does spur on the action dramatically, as the Gear only adds to the elements the characters themselves bring to the table, with this combination of mind and might being the main driving force behind a fight\u2019s narrative. The narrative of these fights is clear and spectacular, with each punch having enough physical and emotional impact behind it to keep your jaw to the floor throughout the entire spectacle \u2013 see the video on fight scenes by Super Eyepatch Wolf for more on than in a better way than I could ever explain it without ripping him off. Still, while super powered boxing fights would be amazing to watch on their own, the main appeal is how our protagonist deals with each opponent, as he fights without the use of Gear, earning him the alias of \u201cGearless Joe\u201d. Ultimately, the fights boil down to raw strength of body and mind at its purest, and at its finest it becomes a crescendo of two untamed powers colliding with each other.\\n\r\nUnfortunately... Some of the show\u2019s best moments do come later after some of the pivotal plot beats, so I shouldn\u2019t really talk about them- this anime is for certain best watched un-spoiled, so you\u2019ll have to trust me that the show never misses a beat with its story and characters. So overall, is this show worth watching, even if you\u2019ve never seen a sports anime, or even if you don\u2019t know the history behind it? Hell yes. MEGALOBOX demonstrates that old is new again, and it\u2019s alive and kicking \u2013 it won\u2019t go beneath your expectations once.\\n\r\nTo put it as simply as it can be, MEGALOBOX is a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I should probably wait until the season is completely out to review it properly and I do intend to do that once it's over, but I just can't contain myself.\r\nBy the anime GOD, am I FLOORED by this anime. I should first note that my interest towards boxing is zero \u2014 despite my father's best efforts to educate me in the subject. I have put off watching this anime particularly out disinterest of the target subject, however, the moment I found myself some down time and decided to indulge in this absolute masterpiece (that I won't truly admit it's a masterpiece until, as I said,the season is done), I utterly failed to put it down.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the visuals to the incredible, memorable soundtrack, to the sound effects and stellar, incomparable storytelling technique, I was both floored by the technical achievements ridiculously obvious even to a layman like me, and entranced by it's tense, mature environment, (almost) wordless world-building and originality. And did I mention the soundtrack? Oh, and the visuals?\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around this nameless nobody trapped in a circle of illegal boxing with an addition of augmented exoskeletons called Gears. The scenario is realistic up to the anime twist of the augmented enhancement. One would think it's your run-of-the-mill boxing anime at the point, with a robotic twist, a tournament anime instead of a tournament arc within an anime, and one wouldn't be wrong. What sells it is how amazingly the idea is executed. Though it sounds fairly farfetched, the concept is grounded by the unique way the story is told. Aside from a few off-matches scenes, there's no suspension of disbelief, in fact, both the characters and scenario fell like they could very easily exist within the real world, yet it's realistic approach doesn't render it boring in any way. I could not blink while watching for fear of missing a nuanced, hidden detail (which I'm certain I did).\\n\\n\r\nI'm 6 episodes in, and I feel very uncomfortable revealing any more that I said already. I can just say this anime provides a unique viewing experience that will be appreciated not just by fans of the subject but by, dare I say, anyone. I should warn it's a mature sort of anime, not in the sense that there's sex or violence to beware (so far I've only seen a mild amount of violence that only carries weight due to the stakes of the narrative), but that it will be better appreciated by an adult audience. Not that it wouldn't flabbergast a teen or preteen, in fact, it might be the Cowboy Bebop of their generation (that anime that sticks with you despite the themes addressed not encompassing your current reality, until one day you come back to it, in your young adulthood and you get it... You understand it now). I'm just saying, early 20s and 30s who have been watching anime since childhood and now, flooded with the sheer amount of new releases will appreciate this break in tone and trope prevalent in the medium. I glowingly recommend it.",

The main cast hardly has any depth to it, their characters are established very quickly and stay static throughout the anime. Absolutely nothing is done to provide the viewer any kind of picture of the world they're in other than giving it a vague cyberpunk vibe. It looks and sounds good and it's fairly engaging to watch, but it's the kind of anime that's best enjoyed if you just shut your brain off and enjoy it at face value.

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal \r\nArt: 6/10 Sharpness was definitely NOT there but it was cool. Didn't really do the split-society any justice. Some panoramic or two-page spread shots would have been nice to have for some world-building aspects. \r\nAnimation: 7/10 Quite fluid. Action scenes and body movement were on point. Nothing to complain about but nothing to praise about either. \r\nCharacters: 6/10 Never really realized. Great setups with a lot of potential but didn't really take off or hit their mark. Character designs were well done. The rugged characters felt rugged. The gangsters felt like gangsters. The wealthy and cold felt asthey should. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10 Very straightforward and simple. Nothing too deep aside from the rivalry between Yuri and Joe. But that too wasn't anything more than a standard hot-blooded rivalry between men. It could be summed up as, \"Man I really want to fight you. This is what a real fight looks like. Only you can provide me with an authentic fight.\"\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 6/10 The overall progression of the story wasn't too bad. The reasoning for having Joe fight because Nanbu got caught cheating the mob seemed a tiny bit forced but whatever. The development of Yuri and his story wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked. Yuri kind of ends up just being there to be that one guy who loves fighting so much that he needs an authentic fight that only Joe can provide. Other than that Yuri seems a sort of one-dimensional. The midget kid wasn't really fleshed out to be meaningful at all. The kid was kind of just \"there.\" The kid made pretty much no impact to the story or main character's development at all. Nanbu was also a victim of the same thing. Nanbu was sort of just there to be the coach figure and provide exposition. The only notable thing that I liked about Nanbu's development was the whole part about him defying the notion of \"people can't change\" when Nanbu cut out his own eye to prove the mob boss wrong. Joe unfortunately seemed really stale when it came down to it. His reasoning for fighting or continuing on was just never fully cemented in my opinion. He did say that he wanted to fight Yuri, but that reasoning just ends up being the same as Yuri's. Both guys just wanted to fight. There's nothing wrong with that per se but this fact ends up hurting the show and development up until the last point. It evens goes so far as to make every fight and major event up until the last fight rushed. This show was a victim of how short it was. This show could have had much more of an impact and could have been much much better if the main characters were fleshed out a bit more to add meat to their reasoning for wanting to fight each other at the championships. The side characters, especially the kid and Nanbu, should have been fleshed out much more to build on the family and companionship idea that the show was trying to build on but failed to do because of how short the show actually was. The very initial setup for Joe during the intro sequence actually did a good job of setting him up as a character looking for meaning. Sure he did find meaning in boxing and fighting Yuri, but I sort of wanted this to be developed a bit more. The ending and conclusion was interesting. Joe won but the show decided to not show the victory but rather some sort of time skip happy ending. This was okay.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10 Good and had a lot of hype moments. Very unique rap sequences which was a plus. Sound design was alright. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10 This show was too short for what it was trying to build on. The relationships between Joe and his friends and rivals were never really fleshed out. The motivations for each of the characters were subject to the same lackluster development. The cripple dude with no legs received more development that Yuri did which is stupid. This show was heavily stylized. It's very unique and seems to borrow a lot of its style from shows like Samurai Champloo. Overall this show was a victim of how short it was. Everything seemed rushed, noticeable from even the earliest episodes.",

            "content": "Honestly, this is overrated. It's by no means a bad show but it is seriously blown out of the water, basically by youtubers and others who are fans of ashita no joe, which I hadn't heard of until now, and happen to like old art-styles, which I do.\r\nIt's a pretty typical underdog story, except not really. Typically in animes the mc of an underdog story goes through a bunch of arcs, however short, in which they develop their skill and often their character, however these are typically found in shounens which this isn't. The way that this story tries to convey this is simply throughranking, which isn't really focused on all that much since the biggest changes in ranking have been of screen. It starts off with the mc and his coach throwing matches in an underground arena for chumps change to a fight in the best ring against the best their is. \\n\r\nThe way the story develops is very forced and rather emotionless. Pretty much all that happens is the mc gets challenged by the champ himself and asked to go to a stage he simply shouldnt be able to get to since he isnt a citizen. But all he does is misbehave and risk the life of his coach because he got a bit cranky that he wasnt given permission by him, despite stating himself that he cant get their.\\n\r\nObviously they find a way but it's done using the \"I have the guts to not back down\" cliche the coach throws to ask his debt collector to help him, even though they just lost him money and caused him trouble, and he helps, of course.\\n\r\nIf you've seen it once this scene will be visible from a mile away and the rest of the show continues in the same vain.\\n\\n\r\nA new character is added to the main cast as a search for a good gear happens, only to not use any gear at all and not use the character for anything but to occasionally settle arguments and cheer on the mc, they are absolutely useless and fill no role, they only draw attention to the lack of teamwork between the mc and the coach which isn't enjoyable to watch because their isn't any tension between them, it's simply the fact that neither listens to each other and the anime plays it off as if they were made for each other. They don't come up with new ideas and the entire time it feels like the mc undermines the coach, and for whatever reason the coach respects him for it?? It doesn't make sense but it happens.\\n\\n\r\nAs a but more focus on the fights, most of the time the choreography is awful and the punches thrown are emotionless, when series of punches are thrown without any foot work or attempt to get away or even re-position for a punch, with the mc being knocked down continuously whilst knocked his opponent down for the count with a single punch. There simply isn't any weight behind them as their isn't ever much of a connection between him and his opponent. He doesnt use gear so they dont fight on equal grounds, and most of the time the opponent is defined by his gear or general fighting style, making them feel very bland at the end of things. The only fight which I can say didnt fall into this completely is with the veteran soldier and that's mostly because he had an emotional backstory which ties in with the coach, and even this fight wasnt interesting because of the mc as he didnt even win it or do anything remotely interesting. The fight ending by default didnt make me care about our mc despite being the most emotional end we get.\\n\r\nSome of the build up we get is wasted as well, a lot of things end with a problem occuring and everything continuing as planned anyway or through some cliches shit where the mc basically throws another tantrum and gets what he wants. These problems are undermined repeatedly throughout the story and the one time something happens, which oddly enough happened to have good choreography during the fight, part of the problem was just dismissed, simply because 'he showed so much guts in his actions that I just had to let him go.' \\n\r\nAnother issue with the series, as I mentioned before is the lack of development. My main problem is that it seems to make a half-assed attempted at developing the main characters skill, which always plays out like, this needs to be improved by doing this, then instantly doing that single thing which may or may not even be used during the fight, and if it is, it wont be that entertaining to see. It's almost as if it just uses some twisted plot armor for the sake of not writing better.\\n\r\nAnd speaking of writing the concept of a massive tournament featuring something that isn't even used by the main character and gets ditched at the end is simply lackluster. For 13 episodes setting up a system where off screen fights have to be used, and all in one go for convenience, was simply not a good idea. It wouldve been better if it had been much smaller but the choice of this made each fight seem less significant especially considering the rate at which they progressed. The use of gear was one-dimensional, really not bringing anything to the table outside of a normal fight, especially considering a scrawny guy is able to one shot someone with some serious high tech gear and withstand any punches he receives. It really fails to convey how strong the main character is, especially considering his size, and is also inconsistent with the power of the gear. The only thing they irritatingly force you to think is that the mc is the 'genuine article' which they dont ever want you to forget and is used as an excuse to let him do what he wants through half the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt is okay, reminiscent of retro styles but it looks too clean in a lot of places, so unless you're used to watching anime that are incredibly cleanly animated, which most aren't, the art really doesnt stand out and I feel people are practically making a fuss out of nothing. Character designs arent anything special. I especially dont like the mc since the way he acts and his actions really dont reflect his looks. He looks more like a NEET than an actual fighter, which im guessing they tried to fix by giving him a number of scars, but they dont even stand out.\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good, most of the time it doesnt stand out all that much and I only ever noticed when a character was rapping, which was cool, or the main theme tune played.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not bad. Just rather mediocre. A few good bits here and there, a number of missed opportunities and a lot of noise from practically everyone watching it atm (whilst it airs). With plenty of people considering it anime of the year already even though it's in the same season as Steins Gate 0, hell, Golden Kamuy was much better than this even though they skipped a lot of the interesting bits and had bad cgi.\\n\\n\r\nMediocrity describes it best",
