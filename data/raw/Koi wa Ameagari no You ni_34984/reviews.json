            "content": "Anyone who has not already given After the Rain a go will more than likely have some serious reservations about watching an anime apparently centered upon some middle-aged dude getting with a high school girl. A glance at the premise and a quick 'no thank you', most people's experience with this anime will be a few seconds at best. \r\nTrue, even when one puts aside the moral implications of such a romance, these sorts of encounters are often left to erotic fiction (the sort people would do their best to enjoy in complete and utter secrecy) and rarely depicted or even acknowledged in any seriouscontext. The man is a manipulator, a pervert, and the girl merely a confused soul. There is no happy ending to be sought, for the situation itself is a crisis without salvation. \\n\\n\r\nIf I told you After the Rain is one of the more innocent and heart-warming anime I've seen, would you believe me?    \\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain is something unique in the entertainment industry. It takes a profoundly controversial topic and focuses not on its moral content, but depicts instead a story of ordinary, decent people merely put into a difficult situation.  A young girl develops an innocent crush on someone older than she who she admires and looks up to, and the man, recognizing the obvious issues with such a difference in age, does his best to dissuade her and lead her back to an ordinary teenage life. There is no sexual tension, no outright physical romance; the two often describe their relationship as something more akin to friendship, even if it may not necessarily be platonic. Perhaps things will stay that way, or perhaps the girl will reach adulthood and find her feelings to stay true. I didn't find the outcome so important. After the Rain exists to capture a moment in time, a slice-of-life anime truer to its genre than nearly all surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of the anime depicts the daily lives of the two protagonists (Tachibana and Kondou) and their co-workers at 'Garden', a family restaurant modeled after the real-world Japanese restaurant 'Gusto'. While most events at Garden are linked in some way to Tachibana's and Kondou's relationship, so too do we see the relationships between the other workers, and get a glimpse at what it is like to work at a Japanese family restaurant. Though these co-workers are hardly developed beyond their one-dimensional comedy relief or jerkass-dude-who-should-be-kicked-and-then-punched-in-the-nutsack roles, their presence serves as a simple reminder that Tachibana and Kondou are just two ordinary souls in a big, bustling city. \\n\\n\r\nAnime has taught us that confessions are meant to be the peak, the conclusion of a romance\u2014that telling someone you like them may as well be asking for their hand in marriage\u2014but for After the Rain, \u201cI like you\u201d is merely the start of their story. Those expecting a long, protracted build-up to the confession may find themselves disappointed, but if you are a bit more like me and prefer to see characters behaving naturally as humans actually do, the pacing in this case is far more appropriate. How could it end with a quick \"yes\" or \"no\", anyway, when the question is such a difficult one to answer?\\n\\n\r\nThough the first few episodes create the impression that the story's primary focus is upon this complicated relationship, Tachibana and Kondou are carefully characterised and developed in other, more multi-dimensional ways. Tachibana is confronted throughout the anime with the consequences of her withdrawal from the track and field club and the strained, awkward relationship with her closest friend, worsening with each day she has left the club. Kondou isn't just some happy-go-lucky 40-something-year-old, but a complicated individual who struggles with reconciling his dreams with reality and of his clinging to the past. Though it is rarely mentioned\u2014likely as he does not want to mention it himself\u2014it is strongly implied that Kondou is still hurt by his separation from his ex-wife and the difficulties of raising his son in this environment. These are issues shared by many real, living and breathing people of their age groups, and the result is that you can identify with the two and give more than a damn about their problems.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth noting how accurate the anime's depiction of its setting, Yokohama, truly is. Famous landmarks of the city such as the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel and Akarenga Warehouses (though, by God, did I ever hate visiting that place with its floods of tourists) are shown regularly throughout the anime, as well as the actual train lines (the Tokyu Meguro) and individual stations (Takadanobaba) of the Tokyo region. The cheap, boisterous nature of the pub Kondou and his old friend visit, along with the drink bars and parfaits on the family restaurant's menu brought a smile to me and made me feel right at home. Though I doubt people who have not lived in the Tokyo area would notice or care much about these details, they do well in making the story feel more real than imaginary.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain has a few minor issues\u2014major, depending on your preferences. The ending is abrupt and does not resolve anything, resembling more the ending of any ordinary episode of the show rather than for the story in its entirety. Kondou's and Tachibana's personal struggles remain ongoing, their relationship still undecided, as though we only got about a third of the way through the story before the book was suddenly slammed shut. The reason why Tachibane loves Kondou is never really made clear\u2014although I suppose you could argue that you don\u2019t need a reason to love someone\u2014and her behaviour regarding him, while cute, can occasionally be a bit creepy and uncomfortable to watch, what with her squealing and squirming in bed like some five-year-old who just got new dollies from mommy. One of her co-workers, the one I so described as a jerkass, detracts from the cute, innocent nature of the anime and briefly turns it instead into some borderline netorare thing. Everything surrounding that situation was frustrating\u2014though I reckon that being frustrated only once by an anime isn't such a bad thing, maybe.   \\n\\n\r\nI can't convince everyone to look beyond the anime's premise, especially with how heated these sorts of topics have become in today\u2019s political climate. But for anime fans willing to go a teeny bit outside of their comfort zone, or even for those who are just fans of slice-of-life anime, After the Rain is a thoroughly enjoyable and heart-warming little adventure.  There's nothing so special about it to deserve high praise, but odds are, it will brighten up a rainy day.",

            "content": "Human feelings are complicated. It\u2019s hard to fully understand anyone except yourself. That might not even be a case if you find yourself attracted to someone. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the type of person that you can\u2019t get off of your mind. I\u2019m talking about the type of person that makes your heart pound the moment you see him or her. When I began watching Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After the Rain), it felt like  taking a test that challenges human feelings. It accomplished that with such impact that by the time I finished watching this series, I was in awe. \r\nBasedon the manga of the same name, this series came like a storm of rain, like a roller-coaster of emotions. As someone who have read the manga, my expectations were high. The first few episodes establishes the general premise as we meet high school student Akira Tachibana. As a former track runner, she isn\u2019t someone easy to get close to especially for her male classmates. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a cold person as we see a different side of her. This side is shown through her interactions with Masami Kondou, a restaurant manager at the place she works at. The series chronicles her life and relationship dynamics with him and what viewers will discover along the way. \\n\\n\r\nNow, getting straight into this show at first may set off some red flags. The idea of a high school student being interested in someone over 40 years old can rub someone in the wrong way. It feels as if the show commits the sin of an unhealthy relationship or daydream fantasy. However, that is not how you should experience the series\u2019 intentions. The idea of the show isn\u2019t just a story about two lovebirds. It\u2019s more about how a series tests human feelings. There\u2019s realism as a lot of the circumstances we witness in this show can happen in real life. The main point is to establish how complicated human feelings can be when tested under heavy waters. Right off the bat, we can see that Akira has feelings towards Kondou. The first episode shows that any dialogue directly related to her manager causes her to react. For instance, some of the dialogues about Kondou\u2019s marital status immediately causes Akira to behave in ways that show her emotions. While this is first seen as cheesy delivery, I see it more as a realistic reaction of how characters should behave. Akira is still young and she doesn\u2019t fully understand what love is. Yet, she feels connected to Kondou because of how kind he is. Similarly, Kondou responds to some of Akira\u2019s feelings such as going on a date and telling how he feels. The way these two connect is incredibly appealing to watch as it\u2019s easy to want to root for them. The charm between their chemistry shines best when they understand more about each other. While it\u2019s easily possible that it won\u2019t be one of those \u2018they live happily ever after' tales, the series still capitalizes on bringing out human feelings at its fullest. \\n\\n\r\nAs a good portion of the show puts emphasis on characterization, expect a lot of background stories and character focus. It doesn\u2019t just fall in the case of Akira but other characters too such as Haruka Kyan. Through effective storytelling, we learn more about Haruka and her connection with Akira. I think an important part to note about the characters is that a good majority of them are worth investing time into. Examples such as Chihiro and Yuuta gives us a better insight of Kondou\u2019s personal life outside of his workplace. Even a character such as Kase can be interesting to watch despite my personal dislike of his interactions with Akira. In essence, the main characters easily carry this series while others play valuable roles to influence their choices. The series remains faithful to their personalities too based on the manga.\\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni takes the approach of bringing mostly drama so if you\u2019re a viewer interested in such genre, then this will be a wonderful treat for you. The title translates to \u201cAfter the Rain\u201d and literally, there\u2019s plenty that falls. In literature and storytelling, this symbolizes for depression as it\u2019s what see from Akira\u2019s perspective in the beginning of the show. Still, there\u2019s light comedy with some hilarious moments too for those who think this may be just a drama fest. \\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of the series is undeniably the character chemistry between Akira and Kondou. It\u2019s hard to ever forget about these two even when episodes doesn\u2019t fully concentrate on them. That brings in the question if you think they do or don\u2019t get together. As a 1 cour adaptation (12 episodes), the show can feel more like a titanic ship tease with how the series delivers its storytelling. It\u2019s obvious the show won\u2019t have a concrete conclusion as the anime couldn\u2019t cover every chapter. However, from a fictional storytelling viewpoint, this series is what I view as drama done right. The emotional moments looks impactful and holds special meaning for the characters. I can\u2019t remember how many times I replayed certain scenes to get a better look at how the characters behave and why they do so in such ways. Plus, I think this show really delivers the promise of its premise without ever being distracting. The only time I do find a character distracting is perhaps Takashi as he\u2019s there for more as comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nAs a studio that produced mostly fantasy themed series, Wit Studio was definitely not a choice that I was expecting. However, I\u2019m highly pleased to say that they aced this with flying colors in terms of production quality. The scenery in this show looks incredibly well-polished and show their effort through the realistic setting with rich details. These scenes also delivers a melancholic tone that you\u2019d fully expect out of this show such as the smiling and crying. The key animation and choreography makes this show sometimes look like a moving painting. Every emotional segment looks impactful through its tone and captures the importance of human feelings. Scenes such as Akira running under the rain or the bittersweet moments when she feels heavy emotions is bought out through the talents of this show\u2019s creative team. The theme songs contain great usage of sequences to show creativity while the visual style of the character designs bring the cast to life. A beautiful girl like Akira deserved such treatment.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t too convinced into the character behaviors in this show until I heard the voices of the cast. Sayumi Watabe may not have an impressive resume but she is able to step into the shoes of Akira perfectly. The way her character speaks brings truth to her personality while showcasing a more delicate side when she\u2019s with the manager. I also felt how real the character cast were whenever they interacted under different circumstances. As a show with heavy drama, Aimer\u2019s performance is nothing short than a spectacle. \u201cRef:rain\u201d felt like one of the most memorable ED theme songs of this year so far with how melancholic it\u2019s performed. The choreography and mood of the sequences captures the series\u2019 themes at its fullest. Besides that, I think the overall usage of the OST in this series also brings in memorable moments. Between quiet moments of melancholy to more dramatic segments, it\u2019s easily acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this show did just about everything it was set up to do and that\u2019s to deliver a drama story with realistic human feelings. What started off as two seemingly lovebirds connecting from a workplace turned into complicated storyteller. I\u2019m more than pleased that this got an anime adaptation in the first place. It felt more like a series suited to air on live action TV as a drama. However, Koi wa Ameagari no You ni lives up to its promise and made a show that\u2019s as real as it can be.\\n",

            "content": "It all started with a broken ankle and faithful encounter over coffee.\r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nSimple, sweet, makes my heart flutter. Like pumpkin custard pudding or black and white cats with white socks or chocolate banana crepes.\r\nThis blissful story follows our main protagonist, Akira Tachibana, through her life as a 17 year old high school student. Though she used to be the top athlete in track and field at her school unfortunately after an injury she no longer runs. This has changed her high school life as she overcomes broken relationships and creates new ones.\r\nDuring a faithful encounter on a rainy day, Kondou meets Tachibana and it giveslife to the girl with the broken ankle. With nothing else to do in her high school life she gets a job working with her boss, Kondou, who she secretly has a huge crush on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the Garden Cafe she finds a new meaning to happiness and looks forward to working with everyone there. Or, that is what she thought. Apparently having a crush on your boss, and working along side the boy who has a crush on you is harder than it looks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is very pleasing to look at. Often reminding me of old anime styles, giving a soft nostalgic feeling. It may have nothing special to it but if you look closely you can see how elegant the designs in her eyes are. Especially during heart fluttering moments, the anime wastes no time in showing us her emotions through the art, as if it had a daydream effect. Beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nIn 2018, I vote the intro and outro songs as best opening and ending. I fell in love with the way they played out, gives me nostalgic feelings to past anime. Apart from the theme songs the background music gives a subtle flare of summer vacation when I was in high school. I can really hear everything happening around the busy city Tachibana lives in as if I were there.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is nothing special about the amazing sounds most anime produce nowadays. I still love it and give my applause to how far it has come.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nAkira Tachibana, aside from her normal life she is a serious and awkward teen who might seem too uptight but is just shy. Aside from being shy, when she smiles I bet she could light up a room. Especially the way the anime lights up my screen during heartwarming moments. The anime portrays subtle clues that she is lonely and she isolates herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe loves rainy days the most out of anything, on the other hand Kondou does not like rainy days.\\n\\n\r\nKonou Masami is her manager who has a bald spot on the back of his head. He is just as socially awkward as Tachibana. Often having to frantically apologize for everything, he definitely shows the father in him. He should since he does have a son and is divorced. One could picture how lonely he must be living alone and working much harder than he should. \\n\r\nOne thing is for certain, there are many more things to him that meet the eye than being an \"old man\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode I jumped right into the ongoing manga series. Although a lot is portrayed differently in the anime than the manga it is still played out nicely. They add quite a bit to the managers personality into the anime and I can definitely agree with their decision. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, I don't enjoy watching adaptations from manga I have read. I find it easy to watch Koi wa Ameagari no You ni without being bored, it makes me smile unexpectedly.\\n\r\nTo think that all of this happened because of a broken ankle.",

            "content": "[Indirectly spoils the ending, and possibly other elements of the show.  This is the sort of thing that's hard to avoid in reviews, and which I don't think should necessarily be avoided.  Consider yourself forewarned.]\r\nToday, I want to write about love.  It's no coincidence that this show is about love and writing, and the love of writing, among other things, because I don't often write in the first place.  From time to time, I find that there are some shows which evoke certain feelings, or thoughts, that I have to write about them.  This is one of those shows.\r\nThere aremany kinds of love.  The advertising for this show, and its OP/ED, focus largely on the romantic kind.  It's almost a shame, because the show focuses mostly on the love of hobbies or work.  Akira and Masami are the kind of people who have lost sight of their passions for one reason or another.  Akira gave up on running due to an injury.  Masami gave up on writing because of a lack of success and the hardship it brought on his family.\\n\\n\r\nIt's frequently difficult to pursue these passions.  It's also not easy giving up on a thing you feel so strongly about, or dealing with the regret of having done so.  That said, wouldn't you be happier doing the former, given that it's a thing you enjoy anyway?  It's a hard question for a lot of people, and like most real-world problems, there isn't one right answer for everyone.  There's a catch to this dilemma, though.  A person who doesn't really want to give up and walk away from his dream simply shouldn't.  He might still do it, though, for one reason or another.  In this case, wouldn't someone who encouraged him to follow his dreams be making his life demonstrably better?  In that case, isn't it better to be with that person?\\n\\n\r\nThis is the essence of human relationships, in the end.  \"Romantic love\" is something that mostly exists only in fiction, and this show isn't interested in perpetuating the fantasy.  However, love itself is real enough, and this show sets out to explore it.  In this case, it starts out in what's basically the most straightforward way.  Akira is physically attracted to Masami.  I consider this much to be clear, though many things in the show are presented nonverbally, and thus up to interpretation.  It's less clear how Masami feels about Akira, especially at first.  I got a similar impression from him that I got from Kyon.  Namely, that he's prone to self-deception.  That's why it's so refreshing that Akira is so honest about how she feels about most things.  This is why it tears at my heart to see her lie to herself, and to others, about the most important one.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, this was a very emotional show for me.  I cried at the finale, which is already rare enough, but it was a different kind of cry.  These were tears of joy; the joy of experiencing something truly beautiful.  I don't consider this to be an accident.  Where many shows would generally be content to tell you what their characters are feeling, or use some kind of established visual shorthand, this show tries to make those emotions visually apparent, and to impart certain feelings onto the viewer.  Nonverbal communication is inherently risky, and I've always admired shows that rely on it and succeed.  This show likes its metaphors, visual and otherwise.  I've long known that Wit Studio has some talented animators, and has a passion for making visually beautiful shows.  It's wonderful to see them take that energy and talent, and use it for a clear purpose.  I'd also like to credit the background artists, because their work is stellar, but I know almost nothing about this element of anime production.  It's also no coincidence that the music is very good; I've often considered this to be the most emotional part of the experience of watching anime.  Even what I thought might be a flaw, that the music is somewhat repetitive, may in fact be a motif, which again serves a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show.  It really speaks to me.  It fits my ideals for what an anime should be, and its theme and some of its trappings appeal to me personally.  Its ending exceeded whatever hopes I might have had for it.  It's not very interesting to talk about its personal appeal to me, since the reader's life experience and situation will certainly be different than mine, but it's there.  That said, I feel confident that this show's more objective merits are strong enough that I could recommend it to anyone.  I hope you love it as much as I do, because in the end, we're better off being happy.  (Sorry, Chihiro!  No poison today.)",

            "content": "After the Rain, an anime full of imagery, symbolism, a mildly controversial plot, and hot track anime girls... I mean, two characters at the crossroads of their lives.\r\nAfter the Rain could have stood to be more ambitious. It plays it so safe and measured that for long stretches of time I was asking myself why I was watching this, or why anyone was watching it.\r\nThe premise can be a little dicey and most of the fan dialogue around this show will mostly be concerning \"the implications of dating someone old enough to be your parent\", The protagonist/MC: Akira Tachibana, is in a bit of aslump. Her Achilles injury has caused her to quit track-and-field and she fills the void by working a part-time job where she continually grows infatuated with her boss(Mr. Kondo).\\n\\n\r\nNow let me be clear. I am analyzing this show on its artistic merits, the controversy surrounding its premise does not really bother me. In fact - I liked it. What I had problems with was the execution. A younger woman attracted to an older man is probably more common than people would like to admit. With that being said, I wish the subject matter was handled... better. After the Rain is cautious and measured; the characters don't get too physically intimate, they never even inched upon the possibility of having a relationship. The mangaka knew exactly what she is going for, and so does the audience. This is never going to end in a declaration of love, but rather it will be a story about both characters working through their emotional baggage.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the rain displayed small windows of great narrative potential. There are great moments of this shows and things that I could enjoy. There is symbolism through imagery and explicit dialogue(i.e. Rashomon, the bookmark). This series also contains parallelism, insofar as Kondo and Tachibana are going through very similar ordeals in their life. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem arises insofar as this shows feels like a bait-and-switch. The episodes seem like it will be an emotionally explorative piece with the focal point being a relationship with this oblivious middle-aged man and Akira; y'know what? I was onboard with that.  However, those elements of the show were constantly undercut by the more slice-of-life elements that feel meandering in nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads grow closer together with Akira pretty aggressively pursuing Kondo. This consist of walking his kid home, nursing him back to health, and chance coincidences. The thing about this, is the setup relied on chance encounters and circumstances. The way the relationship progresses in the story, while seeming natural gives off this unnatural caution that disrupts the tone of this show, and is an example of the mangaka keeping the cards too close to her chest. It never felt like there were any stakes in their friendship/relationship with each other. In fact, it never really felt like this was anything besides a one-sided relationship. Akira has feelings for Kondo and he kind of entertains her. There never was any substantive connection, which was the huge nail in the coffin for me because you are clearly supposed to be rooting for these two.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not helped by the fact that Tachibana may be one of the worst MC's I have seen in awhile. She is not even one note, but rather a complete, wholesale lack of a personality. She usually just stares, maybe says one or two words(exaggeration), and walks in the rain when she is sad.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is oftentimes the center of attention, and the show goes out of the way to make it clear that she is attractive, the star/former star of the track team, and is too good for all those other girls. This series feels more like a shoujo then a seinen insofar as it is framed in the female psyche and female emotions. In some sense, I don't want to talk about it because that level of wish fulfillment is in every show these days. However, I have not seen many people broach the topic, so why not start here?\\n\\n\r\nIt is not necessarily a huge problem, but there were so many unbelievable scenarios regarding their taboo relationship. After the Rain has a hard time selling the audience on basic suppositions that you have to accept in order for this series to work, it also has a poor time portraying male characters in a completely believable way. An example of the latter point being a scene in episode 1, Kondo apologizes to a bratty customer and an older co-worker of Tachibana snarkily remarks \"he is such a pushover, he has no spine\", mind you Kondo is a manager. A manager in the service industry...\\n\\n\r\nI felt early on that there was something \"off \" about the way Kondo is characterized. Kondo needs to be a pushover for the foundation of his \"I have to entertain this girl\" mentality to be believable. It just did not add up to me. Kondo is a full grown adult, he has been in college, he manages a successful restaurant, he has had a marriage that ended in divorce, he has a son, he has a full set of responsibilities. A full plate if you will. None of that aligns with a friendship with a younger co-worker of the opposite sex. This show speaks to that notion that \"age is just a number\", but scenes with Kondo walking in on her sniffing his shirt, them going to restaurants together, and continually meeting up just seems so out of line with everything we know about him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best moments of this was in episode 3 when Kondo flat out told her \"you should reconsider all this\", it is how these types of situations would unravel, and to keep it brief; I don't see a man of Kondo's temperament, personality, and sensibilities not just telling Tachibana to leave him alone.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was entertaining and I usually can find something every season that is watchable. That is this show for me, and the mediocrity of this is only accentuated by the fact that so many shows come out every season that I can recount that was worth more time and attention than this. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Love is like After the Rain. In the midst of stormy conditions you can either comfortably wait inside until the weather dies down or choose to face it head-on, pressing forward through the torrent and seeing where it takes you. Similarly, passion is like after the rain; once drowned out it can leave you confounded and lost with grey clouds hanging overhead. What once before had consumed one\u2019s lifestyle is suddenly pulled away, no longer part of who they are and now must come to terms with this. In After the Rain we are shown two characters, each on the surface seem completely different toone another but upon closer inspection share a comparable suffering \u2013 they are both burdened with the feelings of a lost passion.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nHigh-school sophomore Akira Tachibana is obliged to give up track-and-field after suffering a torn Achilles tendon. Up until this point, running had been part of her life since her earliest memories, almost becoming an instinctual part of her. Now having been ripped away from her passion she finds herself detached from her past world; stumbling along mere sidewalks by her lonesome self, enveloped in a constant downpour that doesn\u2019t appear to let up anytime soon. Akira as shown on numerous occasions is very emotionally-driven, her feelings never bottled up and always fuelling her actions. Now facing the reality of her situation alone, she is at the lowest she has ever been. But one day, whilst sitting inside a family restaurant staring out at the rain, the manager approaches her with a cup of coffee on the house, performs a cute magic trick before saying to her:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s boring when you\u2019re just waiting for the rain to stop. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll stop raining soon.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis alongside his act of kindness captures her heart and results in Akira developing a childlike crush on the man, subconsciously filling the void her injury left with an almost unhealthy love for Masami Kondo, the manager over twice her own age. Going so far as working under him at that very restaurant, becoming more and more committed in confessing her feelings to the man. Considering the subject matter, this series walks on very thin ice with focusing on an implied romance between a young girl and a middle-aged man, even testing the waters at times with her confession leading to a date between the two. But where many other series would have faltered, After the Rain handles this relationship with a level of grace and tactfulness rarely found in anime. It evolves from a simple age-gap romance generally considered taboo to deliver on a tale that focuses on the couple as individuals, each having lost something integral to themselves in the past and are both still learning to cope with.\\n\\n\r\nMasami Kondo may seem a typical kind man on first impression but his life up to this point has been far from what he once hoped for. He is constantly burdened by what could have been \u2013 an avid writer in his youth whose material unfortunately never gained popularity and coupled with a failed marriage, leaves him with an attitude of complacency. His adoration for writing heavily implied as the driving force behind his divorce and losing custody of their child, a tragic turn of events that left his family broken and eventually caused him to abandon his writing. Now whenever his past career work is challenged, he simply blames it on age and sees any serious attempt to change such is inconsequential. He is content in reminiscing about the love he once had bitter-sweetly, afraid of potentially tainting the memories he still cherishes.\\n\\n\r\nBoth our main characters have felt the pain their passions led them to, Akira physically with a severe injury and Kondo emotionally with his family fractured in the process. Both are pushed away from what they lost and have grown fearful of the hole left in their place, afraid of ever returning to them. Kondo is fine reading the words of others and scribbling down notes when working, but at his desk with pen in hand he can only stare at the sheet in front of him, his thoughts never put to paper. Alongside being reminded of his past failings in the form of his highly-successful college friend, he is unable to take that step towards rekindling his passion. Akira is still willing to talk with her friends on the track team, but now doing so is coupled with a feeling of disconnect and angst, stranded alone and forced to watch their practice from the sidelines. Every time she tries to run she\u2019s left injured in the process by her lost love, akin to an abusive relationship she just cannot seem to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nOn that day when Kondo offered her coffee they were only strangers, unaware of what has happened in the other person\u2019s life. What Kondo did know however was the look in her eyes; the longing gaze of someone who\u2019s lost and mourning something important to them. He knows it because it\u2019s the kind of look he shows whenever alone. Staring into the rain at night with cigarette in hand, reflecting on what he once had, his position in life and how he ended up there. Despite the difference in age Kondo is able to empathize with Akira, birthing a stronger connection between the pair from the parallels of their situations. A crush from the teenage girl does initially result from this and while there are moments throughout the show that hint towards romantic feelings being returned by Kondo, the overall approach is cautious and thoughtful. Her fondness for Kondo is illustrated as simply infatuation born out of immaturity and never becomes a path to shape her future. Not only are her feelings never taken advantage of by the older man, but what began as a school-girl affection morphs into a deep mutual respect and understanding between two damaged people.\\n\\n\r\nLove is like After the Rain, but not in a romantic sense. Instead it aspires to depict the rekindling of a lost love that has plagued both Akira and Kondo\u2019s lives. Here lies a story of two people with their own problems that are able to help each other work through them. Allusions are a core aspect of the series used to convey the issues each main character faces, both visually and metaphorically. When referring to the short story \u201cRashomon\u201d, Kondo suggests he is too far gone to try writing once again, claiming he is not the protagonist and does not possess the energy or determination required for it. In response Akira tells him that his regrets aren\u2019t something to wallow in, instead use them as motivation to return to that love that constantly spurred him on. For Akira, her fears of running again are finally addressed when having a conversation around a swallow that had trouble leaving the nest. Asked if the bird could have been happy staying behind in the nest, Kondo asserts that while there might be happiness found, it would forever look up and long for the skies. These moments end up being the push both needed to take the next step forward in their lives. Both have realised they each have a lot to work on as individuals and neither are ready to give up on the dreams they hold dearly in their hearts yet. And so, they each go their separate ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs the end credits roll, a melancholic theme plays set to a race track flooded with rain, only to transform into a bright one as the sun breaks through the clouds whilst the tune meets its climax. It\u2019s a gorgeous representation for how the series closes with both Akira and Kondo coming out of the storm stronger than before, ready to face their passions once more. No matter how long darkness and feelings of uncertainty loom over, there will surely be a light that follows. Amidst the rain seeds of romance were planted, but now that the rain is over do they have the chance to flourish. Whether their relationship still holds romantic love or not remains to be seen. But from a year praised as one of the best for anime, I know there\u2019s at least one show from that year I still hold great fondness for.\\n",

The main female character is 17, which means she's of legal age of consent in most western countries. I'm sure you'll all behorrified to hear that 17 year old's do sometime fantasize about older adults...clutch those pearls!\\n\r\nNow that the arbitrary excuse for not watch it has been dealt with I'd like to make to case for this anime. I've found it to be one of the most engaging series this season. It's at time funny, dramatic, heartwarming and treats its subject matter very seriously.\\n\r\nIf you have your doubts please watch up to, and including, episode 7. I promise you that you will not be disappointed. there is something very poignant about the contrast between an adult who's dreams have been crush by the passage of time but who, nonetheless, remains kindhearted, running headlong into the intense passions of a young adult experiencing her first love in the face of a life changing event.",

            "content": "One look into the premise of this show is enough to turn people off; A high school girl finds herself crushing on a man in his mid-forties who ends up being her boss at the restaurant where she works after class. Japan has no shortage in that kind of unpleasant male-wish-fulfilment fantasy in the anime industry\u2014the older-man-younger-woman \u201cforbidden love\u201d type of tale. The execution of Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After the Rain), from Jun Mayuzuki's manga of the same name, makes it less of a #MeToo story than one about two broken hearts at very different, but equally important, stages of their livesand where they intersect. What starts as an unlikely romance becomes a more aspiring story about one\u2019s unfulfilled dreams leading another to re-evaluate the broken connections of their own life.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain is made unique by the unlikely relationship between the two leading characters. A beginner when it comes to love, Akira Tachibana is emotion-driven, fuelled by her feelings and almost fiercely expresses them instead of bottling things up. Her long-time love for running having been sidelined due to a recent injury, her fiery passion is suddenly redirected towards her crush and part-time job manager, Masami Kondou. The embodiment of youth, she is the spitting image of a High school girl in love. Eager to please yet saddened by life, Masami, keeps a friendly facade without ever displaying an inch of bitterness. His own dreams having been buried many years ago, he\u2019s labelled himself content with life as is. With Akira and Masami having lost a part of themselves at one point in time, they indirectly become what the other needs whether it be the liveliness of youth or the quiet maturity of life experience. As for Masami, he is clearly aware of how inappropriate a relationship with Akira would be, but her attention does help him remember\u2014and revive\u2014his own youthful dreams of becoming a writer. For Masami, too, Akira is less a realistic romantic choice than a totem representing what\u2019s been lost\u2014and what might be found again.\\n\\n\r\nAkira was a track-and-field ace at her school, she tore her Achilles tendon which put a halt to her goals. Now her after-school hours are spent taking orders at a casual dining restaurant called, \u201cGarden.\u201d Masami, a mid-forty-year-old with a self-deprecating laugh and a goofy, positive attitude about everything. They are the complete opposite, the excitable man with a silent midlife crisis, and a reserved young lady who has a fire burning inside her youthful dreams. What ignited this relationship were two events, first being a rainstorm and a cup of coffee while the latter was a confession. Both of these moments happened early within the story, this way, it has more dedicated time in testing the feelings and emotions of these characters. There is something about Masami that has captured Akira's attention and affection, and she believes that whatever it is, it's worth knowing and nurturing. Can we call this a woman\u2019s intuition? Instincts, not logical deductions. Akira is drawn to the fact that he has a need, and she does not yet understand that need is not a romantic one. More so a spiritual one. It's because once was a time that Masami had dreams of being something else, doing other things, and in the time since he has settled for so much less. Just as she has. \\n\\n\r\nThe story being lived out mainly from Akira\u2019s standpoint, with some back and forth with insights into Masami\u2019s life and past. There is a sheer weight of insight that the story provides about its characters.  There\u2019s so much about this series that\u2019s so truthful, so beautiful and so on-point\u2014it impacts you in the way only stories that enlighten our actual lives can impact you. Our protagonists are multi-dimensional characters that go through a lot of development, a lot of relatable high and low\u2019s. Then they begin to let each other into their respective hearts, and Akira thinking about Masami goes from crushing on him to knowing someone whose dreams have also dwindled. When this change goes into play, it affects her on multiple fronts. It not only changes her relationship with Masami, but it also alters her relationship with her close friend Haruka. They were two peas in a pod, drawn together with their love and passion for running, but they drifted apart after Akira's injury. Masami also deals with a real-world issue like Akira when it comes to raising his son in a shared-parenting situation with his ex-wife, the pain of the divorce still lingers with him and both help each other when they confront these problems.\\n\\n\r\nWhen two people show up on stage together and the result is a special \u201cspark,\u201d you know you\u2019re seeing character chemistry. Chemistry is the \u201cit\u201d factor in all great fiction and that is exactly what Akira and Masami share, this is the main point that makes this anime amazing. They both light up the room\u2014amp up each other\u2019s energy, instantly making each other happy, and make it easy for one another be their best self along with their vulnerable self. Both respond to one another according to any number of social and subliminal signals that end up creating paradigms that belong uniquely to them. It\u2019s a subtle dance, in which they take cues from one another, testing out their moves, discovering to what degree they can unleash the full power of their personalities in an ever-shifting dynamic of opposition and harmony. There is also a supporting cast that helps give Akira and Masami an impact in their decisions when needed, while they aren\u2019t fleshed out, they do play pivotal roles and give the story a much-needed change of mood and pace without it feeling out of place. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s common in love tales in anime is that romance is an ingredient and not a subject, normally used in a way to pull laughter and tears from the viewers. Things aren\u2019t interesting by default because the characters in it are in love; the same goes for the characters themselves. But every now and then get a series that is about the way love is awkward, difficult and self-contradictory and not just a showcase for those things. It is hard to depict characters in love, there is a great risk of looking less impressive and blinded by love, instead of being empowered and uplifted by it. After the Rain\u2019s method of showing how its characters are made better by what they feel Is best portrayed in this particular element that stands out from the rest. Twice Akira visualizes about having an embrace-and-kiss moment with Masami\u2014the first happened earlier on after a date and once more at the very end of the show after she has run out after to give him some documents. But both times, we get the reality of things and not what Akira fantasizes, each going their separate way by themselves, while no longer alone, knowing they have each other as an aspirational strength in their lives. \\n\\n\r\nWit Studio perfectly adapted this series, their works made After the Rain into a more memorable, enjoyable and mesmerizing experience. While remaining somewhat loyal to the manga, Wit\u2019s own take on character design brings extra elements when it comes to general appearance and personality. Referencing a modern take on a 90\u2019s anime art style while keeping an intriguing illustrative format pushes the art to the same level of importance as the narrative, having them compete for the spotlight. The animation has great fluidity, the colour scheme has all shades of human emotion and feelings, all the fine details in the background and various locations bring the setting in a bustling city to life. The director in Ayumu Watanabe gives it the little touches that colour in the spaces between the emotional frames, and that gives Akira and Masami\u2019s story it\u2019s astonishing depth and realism. He was able to illuminate the \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach effectively where a single moment provokes numerous emotions and can tell a story on its own. Each episode works in this format where the first part builds towards something while the latter part concludes with an influential and impactful crescendo that feels like a little film in itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is gorgeous and outstanding. Ryo Yoshimata\u2019s thick atmospheric background music\u2014which is definitely one of the best for 2018\u2014paired with Ayumu\u2019s direction and Wit\u2019s glorious artwork makes After the Rain the complete package. The voice actors are a perfect pitch and are irreplaceable. The OP \"Nostalgic Rainfall\u201d by CHiCO with HoneyWorks plays on the innocent crush that Akira has for Masami, it has a happy, playful and upbeat tone that sets the romantic mood. The ED \"Ref:rain\" by Aimer is a more very meaningful and emotional ballad. It perfectly portrays a more accurate picture of the series, that is something greater and deeper than just an unlikely romance. The lyrics touch on yearning desires, farewells, mourning the loss of good things in your life while being left with the bad\u2014along with imagery of a dark and rainy track field, then the song hits the climax when it finishes its slow transformation into a bright and sunny one. It\u2019s one of the best ED song choices and visual pieces I have seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is this quote from the series that I loved, it really highlights the message of After the Rain, \u201cThe swallow knows that / Any place where you won\u2019t get wet from the rain / Will also have no sunlight.\u201d It\u2019s a very powerful and beautiful moment, one that definitely represents self-reflection and healing\u2014For both Akira and Masami, knowing that someone will love and accept them unconditionally, without judgment, for who they are is surely going to give them the courage and determination to follow their heart once more. They discover each other in a lonely world and giving that gift to the other. Once broken, two hearts beat as one.\\n",

            "content": "After the Rain takes the idea of slice of life and romance to a very different, analogous level. You have two people adrift in the world disconnected from their passion, if not obsession, in life. The story is as much about the intense, irrational emotions of youth as well as the surrender of dreams. It is two unlikely people connecting in the face of similar despair with young love as the rocket fuel catalyst. Two people who find they need each other in unexpected ways.\r\nThe shaping of the characters is one of my favorite subtleties of this series. Akira is single minded, intense and downright forceful, which lends to the humor of the show. She is robbed of her greatest joy and focus of that intensity, which, to me, shows the level of devastation she is going through dealing with the loss and her keen focus on Kondo. Kondo is the end result of a failed passion; plodding through life as a cog in a role that doesn't suit him while keeping his passion at arms length. The episode where Kondo helps Akira with her Rashomon homework is almost a perfect summary of this entire series, including Kondo's joyful response to being able to see the characters from multiple perspectives. It's also a bit of recognition that this series follows, or at least borrows, those Japanese literary roots. In particular, the ambiguous nature of Rashomon ending.  \\n\\n\r\nWith no offense intended to some younger viewers (or those who haven't had your face dragged through the gravel of life . . . yet), I think us more \"experienced\" people can appreciate this quite a bit more. Just like Kondo, we can remember those heated passions, for better or worse, of our youth, as well as the excitement of reigniting a long dormant passion.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the story is nothing less than I expected; satisfying, sad, poignant.  The story likely resonates with different people in different ways depending where one is in life, which makes the story all the more vibrant.     \\n\\n",

            "content": "When I look back on this show after everything has concluded, I find my thoughts to be at odds. On one hand, I really loved the way Akira and Kondou\u2019s relationship was handled and developed over the season. On the other, I felt as if the show lost momentum when it focused on their interactions with the supporting cast. \r\nFor those of you expecting a straight age gap romance plot, I\u2019m here to tell you now you\u2019re going to be disappointed. The romance ends up being the lens through which to tell a story about two people confronting their inner struggles and how those inevitablyshape their identity. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a leg injury that leaves Akira unable to run for months on the track team, she finds solace in working at a family restaurant whose manager has caught her interest. She sees Kondou as a responsible, compassionate, humble, and mature man. She would be hard-pressed to find someone with those same qualities in her high school environment. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the age differential, she moves forward in her attempts to start a romantic relationship with him. In the beginning, this is the main focal point. Akira makes many moves to slowly become closer with Kondou and this, in turn, puts him in an awkward spot as not only someone much older than her but as her manager as well. Kondou sees himself as just a deadbeat father working a modest living in the service industry. It\u2019s tough for him to turn down Akira\u2019s affections when she\u2019s such a charming girl. You really root for her because of how genuine she is with her feelings. Of course, it helps that she\u2019s a real head turner too.\\n\\n\r\nAs Kondou tries to contextualize Akira\u2019s love to her so that she might stop looking at him in a romantic sense, he unwittingly starts to rediscover his youth. He views Akira as this naive beautiful young woman with so much potential. She is a mirror reflecting his past as a young man charging straight into love without a second thought. Reminded also of the literature he once threw himself into which he no longer pursues. Exploring this youth and the feelings that come with it, the plot\u2019s focus begins to shift and ultimately we get to the true heart of the show. Upon realizing that Akira is potentially exhausting her youth on him he maneuvers to distance and reposition himself as a supporting figure in her life. More a good friend than a lover. It\u2019s painful knowing those feelings won\u2019t be reciprocated but Akira learns to accept the reality as things progress.\\n\\n\r\nAfterward, Akira starts to really think about her love for running again and Kondou does the same revisiting his writing passions through an old friend. Now, this is where the show sort of dipped in momentum for me. Haruka is a girl introduced as Akira\u2019s best friend and teammate on the track team before all this. Several times throughout the show she is presented as this opposing force trying to get Akira back on the track team because of a promise they made when they were younger. There is hinting that she also has somewhat romantic feelings for Akira but that\u2019s less important. I think she was meant to be another pillar of support in line with the way our main characters were changing but she comes off as this passive jealous person who wants her friend back for selfish reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character acting in opposition to the way things were developing is Kase. He\u2019s the restaurant chef and playboy who tries to discourage and mock Akira\u2019s feelings for the manager for one whole episode. His purpose in the show I don\u2019t fully understand because he\u2019s barely shown or mentioned after. I\u2019m actually thankful his interactions were somewhat limited.\\n\\n\r\nThese pauses in the plot, mostly caused by Haruka, were what hurt my overall enjoyment of it. Had Haruka taken more of an active role like Akira in expressing her sentiments and not just stared at her from afar for way too long, maybe she\u2019d be more of a fleshed out and likable character.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s get back on track. As the series came to a close, I felt Kondou and Akira\u2019s relationship was in a great spot and that it was clear skies from there on. I was a bit saddened because if I wanted to know more about the direction it was going in I would have to read the manga. So despite the show\u2019s weaknesses in its supporting character interactions and somewhat disjointed transitions, it was a beautifully animated narrative about two people\u2019s journey to discover themselves and the role that love plays in the process.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds like a story worthwhile to you then please give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "Well, for being a romance story between a 45 year old man (Kondo) and a 17 year old girl (Akira), it didn't come off as creepy as I had thought it'd be. I suppose I don't have much moral qualms with it though since 17 is legal in a lot of places... barely. Anyways, I absolutely adored the art style. It's just so pretty, and well executed. I adore all the facial expressions the some of the characters make. I did think some of the pacing is kind of rushed. I did read the first volume of the manga series before this, and it's alot more slow burn than this. Though given this anime only has 12 episodes, maybe this issue is to be expected. I love how the anime slowly unravels details about the characters. We don't learn that Kondo is a writer until way later in the series, though we can see glimpses of that earlier with his novel collection, and poetic way of speaking. I do like how Kondo and Akira help each other grow. Akira is nervous about her drifting friendship with her friend from track since she quit the team. Kondo has a novelist friend from college that he kind of drifted from. Using his experience with his friend, he consoles her about her friendship, and it's just so nice. One thing about Kondo's character is his insecurities with his age. He wants to write and feel young again, but doesn't feel confident about it. Akira does see his good points and encourages him to write again, which is also heartwarming. The scene where he hugs Akira for the first time made me cry. Like the buildup was perfect. There is also some symbolism with things like birds, umbrellas, keychains, etc. Which I dig. I like subtle things like that. What's interesting is that there is romantic buildup between Kondo and Akira in the first half of the series, then the second half deals with the personal problems of each character. Though as I mentioned earlier, the two help each other through these problems so it's not like their relationship development is totally abandoned. On one hand, I was craving more romance, but on the other, I sort of like this too because it's very sweet. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I was able to verbalize why I liked this anime so much very well, but I was really invested in it, and loved every minute of it.",

I'll admit, I was a little apprehensive about reading that it followed a 45 year old man and a 17 year old girl, but this show does an amazing job of not making it weird.\r\nThe animation is also AMAZING. Tachibana's eyes are gorgeous. The rain scenes aren't just randomly added in, they usually happen when something emotional is going on, and watching the rain is so comforting. \r\nOverall, I think it's a nice slice of life anime and even though I wasa little disappointed by the ending because it did not live up to my expectations based off of every other romance I've seen, it was still amazing.",

            "content": "Koi wa Ameagari no You ni: A forced \"Play Safe\"\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni threatened to touch controversial and even delicate topics, but ended up staying in a simple flirtation.\r\nAs I said in my first impressions, this series was presented with a very interesting setting to take us out of the typical high school and introduce us to the world of a family restaurant; In addition, from the beginning, it strongly opted to show us that \"crush\" that Tachibana had for her boss, to the point that even the girl forced the man to notice it.\r\nHowever, already at that moment I noticed that thefact that this series was based on an ongoing manga could lead us to the fateful \"open end\"; and sadly that was just what happened.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst was not that, but the final episode showed a very big change of pace with respect to the rest of the series; which made it feel too hurried. It was as if you had to relax any tension to be able to close the anime in a neutral point.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that the Manager was already on track to resume his passion for writing and it is also true that Tachibana was getting closer and closer to returning to her beloved athletics and returning to her friendship with Haruka; nevertheless, if we see the rhythm that all the other episodes had, it is impossible not to feel that in the last one it put his foot on the gas pedal.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, all that \"sprint\" ended in a completely anticlimactic outcome that honestly tasted like nothing. This is the great disadvantage of adapting a work that has not finished. Or a large license is taken and an end is shown that can then be refuted by the original material; or an open ending is sought where there is no compromise in the plot to stay true to that material.\\n\\n\r\nIn Koi wa Ameagari no You ni, it takes the second road and that led us to this final \"without salt\" that left little and nothing. Indeed, it is unfortunate that a series where the commitment of the creative team was noted for providing a great product, culminates in this way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there was material to show us a more daring ending, either by continuing to develop the controversial relationship between Akira and Kondo, or by exploring a possible yuri romance between Akira and Haruka. Throughout the season it flirted with both options; although evidently, the emphasis was on the \"crush\" of the protagonist by the manager. Haruka's thing was always more like an unrequited love. However, in the end all this was \"stand by\" because the director opted for a \"play safe\" to avoid running the risk of going against the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the technical section, the design of characters was very attractive and unusual, the soundtrack simply fulfilled (highlighting the ending well above everything else), the animation was one of the best of the season; and the direction did a great job even though a better closing could be done.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to be fair, they had their hands tied. In fact, despite the open end, a sequence imagined by the Manager was included that served as a fan service for all those people who expected greater progress in the romance. Not all directors do that in such scenarios, so the gesture is appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a nice series to watch with an interesting plot that in the end could not progress more due to the restrictions of the original material. It only remains to read the manga to know how this story continues and see what the true outcome of that attractive romance between Tachibana and her Manager will be.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10.",

            "content": "My point of view: I didn't read the manga. (Also, if this happens to be relevant to you, I went into this anime not supporting relationships with age gaps like this one)\r\nStory: Although this anime is considered a romance, I honestly like how the main relationship was already set up to fail. The main character was a confused young teen who \"fell\" in love with a goofy guy in his 40's. Rather than progressing their \"romantic\" relationship, they explored the factors behind it. Why does she believe that she's in love with a middle-aged man she knows nothing about? What happened to make her feelthis way? What do both parties get out of the relationship? Because of this, the characters were really the shining part of this anime. In regards to the story, I felt as though the climax, the conflict, and the conclusion were awfully weak. I've seen slice of life with a more distinct plot than this. In conclusion, the plot was about a relationship destined to fail, and it worked; however, the other elements of the plot were a bit weak.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was glorious. I loved how the art kind of had the aesthetic of the natural beauty after a rain. Sometimes it was dim and gray, but during the more important scenes, it was shiny and bright, almost like the sun was reflecting the image off of a puddle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was how I usually like it, un-recognizably good. The background music was subtle, beautiful, and didn't distract you from the show. However, I feel as though the ending song, Aimer's \"Ref:rain\", was my favorite part of the show. In fact, I feel as though the song gave a better interpretation of the show than the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were really the shining part that, I believe, saved the show. At first, the 2 main characters were just a teenager, Akira, and her crush/boss, Kondou. Throughout the animation, the characterization progresses creating characters who are not only more complex but realistic and relatable. I do, on the other hand, feel as though a lot of the side characters suffered with a lack of development. The lives of these side characters were brought up, but they were missing a special touch: the why behind the behavior. It wasn't even that the characters were flat characters, there was room for development and progression; the anime just passed on the opportunity. Considering how the characters did take a part in the plot, I felt as though they should've had a little more development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although I was entertained enough to stick with the show, I still felt like my enjoyment was a tid bit above average. It had potential, but I felt as though it missed out on a lot that could've made it better. I was waiting for a break out moment that never really came. A part of me wonders if the manga did a better job of branching out on the plot and other characters.",

            "content": "I was a teenage girl very recently. And based on my own experience, this is the most honest portrayal I've ever seen of what it's like to be a teenage girl in love. It portrays quite openly all the weirdness, misplaced lust, and slight insanity of a young heart's growing pains.\r\n(Maybe it's also a good portrayal of what it's like for all people in general. Or maybe it's not a very good reflection of the majority of people's experience at all. But I just wanted to start off this review by pointing out that I could definitely relate.)\r\nStory: 9\r\nDespite the fact that the main storylinedeals with Akira falling in love with her middle-aged boss, the underlying theme of the story is actually not about that at all. Instead, it's about following or giving up on dreams; how our over-commitment or under-commitment to those dreams affects the way we treat our family and friends; and whether or not youth is truly wasted on the young. The storytelling focuses on the little details, which lent a superb reality and delicacy to an extremely awkward and difficult premise. But I have to commend the treatment of something so awkward and difficult in a way that did not condone it but gently put forth the question of what the characters could possibly get out of it or learn from it.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to combine these and simply say that the beautiful animation is a treat and the extremely well-designed and purposeful sound is sublime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nI've probably pressed the point enough that I was once Akira and that her character showed a raw and honest portrayal of that supremely awkward and sometimes awful stage of learning love (and misplacing it dreadfully). Most of the side characters are pretty standard tropes and functioned pretty well within their role in the story. But Akira's friend Haruka is very well-rounded and relatable and their friendship actually ends up being the most important relationship in the story. Then we have Kondou. His struggle between trying to ward off Akira's advances and a crisis inside him of wishing to regain his lost youth through her is a dangerous but powerful character arc and I thought really well done. Again, the point here is not a love story at all. It's about very real and complex human emotions that cannot be defined in a word. Perhaps they can be called a kind of \"love\" -- but only as subtly and fleetingly as the moment just after the letting up of the rain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nBeing such an awkward and difficult premise, again, this wasn't the most entertaining or fun watch. But I feel like I really gained something other than enjoyment from it and there's nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAt one point a character says that pure literature should not \"help\" people but instead be a \"poison\" -- Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is, in my opinion, a very powerful and beautiful poison.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so have patience.  Warning:  spoilers ahead.  I think this anime is very polarizing.  Some will love its visuals, which are very good, and its shift away from a controversial subject that makes them uncomfortable.  Others will see it as a disjointed, poorly plotted story that loses its way after episode 7.  The story advertises itself as a romance between a 17 year old girl and a 45 year old man.  It's clear both from the OP and ED that this is the main audience draw.  \r\nThe story starts with a depressed Akira,apparently a budding track star who has suffered an achilles injury.  She meets Kondo in a restaurant to which she runs to get out of the rain.  Rain is a metaphor here, but the anime hits you over the head with it.  In contrast to Koi Kaze, where wind was used to mark essential turning points, here it is used bluntly as an attempt to convey emotions.  It gets tiring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a classic bait-and-switch.  The tension and best story writing do indeed involve the crush Akira has for the much older manager, a divorcee with a child and a dead-end job, suffering a mid-life crisis.  Being Kondo's age myself, I really empathized with his plight.  A little insight into Japanese society makes clear that the author had no choice but to steer clear from this subject.  Compensated dating is a current social problem in Japan, and the issue of divorce, ironically, is more controversial than incest (at least to the Japanese censors).  The manga, which I have read, and the anime are really two different stories.  The manga is dark, using themes from Japanese culture dealing with Yuki Onna, a ghost -like succubus.  Guess who that is?  It delves more into Kondo's suffering. It's dark and unsatisfying ending has aroused indignation in Japan.  It comes as a gut punch.  I give the author license to draw dark stories, but they must be well-plotted, and the anime, while less dark, does  not meet this criteria.\\n\\n\r\nThe tension between Kondo and Akira ramps up to episode 7, ending with a scene reminiscent of Koi Kaze, for those familiar with that dark masterpiece.  It then goes into an entirely different direction, thus dropping all the tension that drew the viewer to the anime in the first place.  Thus, it fails to resolve the central conflict that held my attention:  how can a much older man in Kondo's state withstand the avid attention of a very beautiful young woman?  In real life, of course, such attention would create a serious internal conflict for the man, even if he had no intention of returning the affection.  Here, it really is not touched upon, except in episode 7, which was brilliantly filmed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, the series loses steam as it tries to re-focus to the safer topic of life lessons.  However, good drama is not safe, and it feels like a cop out after all the tension that had been built over the previous episodes.  There is not even a satisfactory explanation for why this relationship was necessary to achieve the changes in the characters' life directions.  A college friend, introduced late in the series, seems to be the primary influence on Kondo.  A friend and Kondo's son seems to have been the tipping point for Akira.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to drop this after episode 10, but I saw it through.  WIT Studio, which produced the series, did an admirable job making the drawn-out manga into a 12 episode anime, and the production values are high.  But it is a half-a-story, and thus earns a 5.",

            "content": "I thought that I would write a review for this anime since the current top review is only based on the first four episodes. The aforementioned review paints an unfair and unrealistic picture of the anime. Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (Koi henceforth) is an anime that gets incrementally better as it continues. \nKoi is a story far more concerned with personal growth and adulthood than the seemingly taboo premise it represents. The umbrella topic of 'adulthood' is explored through character interactions and various symbolic devices. This review will explore the themes and messages of the anime within the categorical confines of: story, art,sound and character.\\n\\n\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\nThe story itself is not overly complex or revolutionary. The narrative explores the increasingly intertwined lives of the male lead (Mr Kondou) and the female lead (Tachibana). Although inherently simple in nature, the story flows well and fits the genre. It has a suitable balance of comedy and drama too. Having said that, some of the earlier episodes do have some borderline unnecessary comedic moments.\\n\\n\nAs alluded to earlier, the story does become more fluid and enjoyable as the anime continues. This fluidity is reflected by the increasingly well-placed symbolism in later episodes. Rain is a recurring motif. Whilst it may represent many things, it adds an appropriate layer of intensity to the storyline and the overall mood without being overbearing.\\n\\n\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\nThe art is polished and easy to look at. Tachibana looks like she would fit well in a shoujo or josei manga/anime at times. This sort of hybrid style does help to make the characters distinctive and memorable.\\n\\n\nWithout spoiling anything, some of the more dramatic/emotional scenes also use different colour palettes and contrasts. Although not a novel technique, it is executed well and adds to the quality of the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\nThe OP and ED songs are both nice to listen to. They are memorable and also reflect the duality of happiness and sadness that persists throughout the anime. Some of the soundtracks are ordinary at best but at least one of the sad soundtracks stands out. It fits the bittersweet and sad moments perfectly and adds to the overall emotion of these scenes.\\n\\n\nThe Japanese VAs are acceptable. I would say that Mr Kondou's VA stands out most. The inflection of his voice helps to show the various sides of his character; from being amusingly clumsy to being nihilistically pensive.\\n\\n\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\nAlthough the characters do start off as archetypes, they do grow as the series progresses. This is actually something that pleasantly surprised me while watching.\\n\\n\nA slight caveat however; none of the side characters really stand out. Hence why I have neglected to mention them or discuss them in any depth.\\n\\n\nTachibana- \\n\\n\nShe is a quintessentially na\u00efve 17 year old girl. Although she does distance herself from her school peers, her affection and feelings toward Mr Kondou are very innocent and idealistic. She refuses to think or reflect upon the practical considerations of a potential relationship.\\n\\n\nTachibana is an interesting character because her youthful vigour makes it easy for her to reject social expectations or norms. For instance, she is not bothered by the pervasive taboo of a teenager dating a middle-aged man. Overall, her character provides an interesting contrast to conventional adult cynicism on the topic.\\n\\n\nKondou-\\n\\n\nAt the start, Kondou is just a socially awkward and clumsy middle-aged man and a single father. He exists mainly as the unaware and innocent romantic interest of Tachibana.\\n\\n\nI am wary of spoilers but Kondou grows throughout each episode. Aspects of his past are hinted at throughout the story and his reactions to Tachibana's affection are authentic and believable.\\n\\n\nMuch of the symbolism throughout the story accentuates the relationship between the two characters. At times, the viewer also begins to understand Kondou better through Tachibana's eyes. As part of this process, we also understand Tachibana better and see her grow.\\n\\n\nConcluding thoughts:\\n\\n\nAll in all, I can wholeheartedly recommend Koi. I say this as a harsh critic that generally avoids anything with a hint of romance. Just as one should not judge a book by its cover, I would not judge this anime based on the first few episodes or the premise.\\n",

Well, i am really wrong. \r\nRomance is a side genre from this anime, life is the main genre. It tells us how dream canbe a symbol of hope to us, who live without and with obstacles. \\n\\n\r\nwhat makes it even better is all aspect of the anime support the story greatly. The art, sound, and character are well built that makes the anime very eye catching and makes us want to watch it in one sit.\\n\\n\r\nBut the reason why I only give it a 8 and not 9 or 10 is, i'm not really into such 'set', but it kind of blown me away after i finished it.

            "content": "Anyone who has not already given After the Rain a go will more than likely have some serious reservations about watching an anime apparently centered upon some middle-aged dude getting with a high school girl. A glance at the premise and a quick 'no thank you', most people's experience with this anime will be a few seconds at best. \r\nTrue, even when one puts aside the moral implications of such a romance, these sorts of encounters are often left to erotic fiction (the sort people would do their best to enjoy in complete and utter secrecy) and rarely depicted or even acknowledged in any seriouscontext. The man is a manipulator, a pervert, and the girl merely a confused soul. There is no happy ending to be sought, for the situation itself is a crisis without salvation. \\n\\n\r\nIf I told you After the Rain is one of the more innocent and heart-warming anime I've seen, would you believe me?    \\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain is something unique in the entertainment industry. It takes a profoundly controversial topic and focuses not on its moral content, but depicts instead a story of ordinary, decent people merely put into a difficult situation.  A young girl develops an innocent crush on someone older than she who she admires and looks up to, and the man, recognizing the obvious issues with such a difference in age, does his best to dissuade her and lead her back to an ordinary teenage life. There is no sexual tension, no outright physical romance; the two often describe their relationship as something more akin to friendship, even if it may not necessarily be platonic. Perhaps things will stay that way, or perhaps the girl will reach adulthood and find her feelings to stay true. I didn't find the outcome so important. After the Rain exists to capture a moment in time, a slice-of-life anime truer to its genre than nearly all surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\nA significant portion of the anime depicts the daily lives of the two protagonists (Tachibana and Kondou) and their co-workers at 'Garden', a family restaurant modeled after the real-world Japanese restaurant 'Gusto'. While most events at Garden are linked in some way to Tachibana's and Kondou's relationship, so too do we see the relationships between the other workers, and get a glimpse at what it is like to work at a Japanese family restaurant. Though these co-workers are hardly developed beyond their one-dimensional comedy relief or jerkass-dude-who-should-be-kicked-and-then-punched-in-the-nutsack roles, their presence serves as a simple reminder that Tachibana and Kondou are just two ordinary souls in a big, bustling city. \\n\\n\r\nAnime has taught us that confessions are meant to be the peak, the conclusion of a romance\u2014that telling someone you like them may as well be asking for their hand in marriage\u2014but for After the Rain, \u201cI like you\u201d is merely the start of their story. Those expecting a long, protracted build-up to the confession may find themselves disappointed, but if you are a bit more like me and prefer to see characters behaving naturally as humans actually do, the pacing in this case is far more appropriate. How could it end with a quick \"yes\" or \"no\", anyway, when the question is such a difficult one to answer?\\n\\n\r\nThough the first few episodes create the impression that the story's primary focus is upon this complicated relationship, Tachibana and Kondou are carefully characterised and developed in other, more multi-dimensional ways. Tachibana is confronted throughout the anime with the consequences of her withdrawal from the track and field club and the strained, awkward relationship with her closest friend, worsening with each day she has left the club. Kondou isn't just some happy-go-lucky 40-something-year-old, but a complicated individual who struggles with reconciling his dreams with reality and of his clinging to the past. Though it is rarely mentioned\u2014likely as he does not want to mention it himself\u2014it is strongly implied that Kondou is still hurt by his separation from his ex-wife and the difficulties of raising his son in this environment. These are issues shared by many real, living and breathing people of their age groups, and the result is that you can identify with the two and give more than a damn about their problems.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth noting how accurate the anime's depiction of its setting, Yokohama, truly is. Famous landmarks of the city such as the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel and Akarenga Warehouses (though, by God, did I ever hate visiting that place with its floods of tourists) are shown regularly throughout the anime, as well as the actual train lines (the Tokyu Meguro) and individual stations (Takadanobaba) of the Tokyo region. The cheap, boisterous nature of the pub Kondou and his old friend visit, along with the drink bars and parfaits on the family restaurant's menu brought a smile to me and made me feel right at home. Though I doubt people who have not lived in the Tokyo area would notice or care much about these details, they do well in making the story feel more real than imaginary.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain has a few minor issues\u2014major, depending on your preferences. The ending is abrupt and does not resolve anything, resembling more the ending of any ordinary episode of the show rather than for the story in its entirety. Kondou's and Tachibana's personal struggles remain ongoing, their relationship still undecided, as though we only got about a third of the way through the story before the book was suddenly slammed shut. The reason why Tachibane loves Kondou is never really made clear\u2014although I suppose you could argue that you don\u2019t need a reason to love someone\u2014and her behaviour regarding him, while cute, can occasionally be a bit creepy and uncomfortable to watch, what with her squealing and squirming in bed like some five-year-old who just got new dollies from mommy. One of her co-workers, the one I so described as a jerkass, detracts from the cute, innocent nature of the anime and briefly turns it instead into some borderline netorare thing. Everything surrounding that situation was frustrating\u2014though I reckon that being frustrated only once by an anime isn't such a bad thing, maybe.   \\n\\n\r\nI can't convince everyone to look beyond the anime's premise, especially with how heated these sorts of topics have become in today\u2019s political climate. But for anime fans willing to go a teeny bit outside of their comfort zone, or even for those who are just fans of slice-of-life anime, After the Rain is a thoroughly enjoyable and heart-warming little adventure.  There's nothing so special about it to deserve high praise, but odds are, it will brighten up a rainy day.",

            "content": "Human feelings are complicated. It\u2019s hard to fully understand anyone except yourself. That might not even be a case if you find yourself attracted to someone. Yes, I\u2019m talking about the type of person that you can\u2019t get off of your mind. I\u2019m talking about the type of person that makes your heart pound the moment you see him or her. When I began watching Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After the Rain), it felt like  taking a test that challenges human feelings. It accomplished that with such impact that by the time I finished watching this series, I was in awe. \r\nBasedon the manga of the same name, this series came like a storm of rain, like a roller-coaster of emotions. As someone who have read the manga, my expectations were high. The first few episodes establishes the general premise as we meet high school student Akira Tachibana. As a former track runner, she isn\u2019t someone easy to get close to especially for her male classmates. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a cold person as we see a different side of her. This side is shown through her interactions with Masami Kondou, a restaurant manager at the place she works at. The series chronicles her life and relationship dynamics with him and what viewers will discover along the way. \\n\\n\r\nNow, getting straight into this show at first may set off some red flags. The idea of a high school student being interested in someone over 40 years old can rub someone in the wrong way. It feels as if the show commits the sin of an unhealthy relationship or daydream fantasy. However, that is not how you should experience the series\u2019 intentions. The idea of the show isn\u2019t just a story about two lovebirds. It\u2019s more about how a series tests human feelings. There\u2019s realism as a lot of the circumstances we witness in this show can happen in real life. The main point is to establish how complicated human feelings can be when tested under heavy waters. Right off the bat, we can see that Akira has feelings towards Kondou. The first episode shows that any dialogue directly related to her manager causes her to react. For instance, some of the dialogues about Kondou\u2019s marital status immediately causes Akira to behave in ways that show her emotions. While this is first seen as cheesy delivery, I see it more as a realistic reaction of how characters should behave. Akira is still young and she doesn\u2019t fully understand what love is. Yet, she feels connected to Kondou because of how kind he is. Similarly, Kondou responds to some of Akira\u2019s feelings such as going on a date and telling how he feels. The way these two connect is incredibly appealing to watch as it\u2019s easy to want to root for them. The charm between their chemistry shines best when they understand more about each other. While it\u2019s easily possible that it won\u2019t be one of those \u2018they live happily ever after' tales, the series still capitalizes on bringing out human feelings at its fullest. \\n\\n\r\nAs a good portion of the show puts emphasis on characterization, expect a lot of background stories and character focus. It doesn\u2019t just fall in the case of Akira but other characters too such as Haruka Kyan. Through effective storytelling, we learn more about Haruka and her connection with Akira. I think an important part to note about the characters is that a good majority of them are worth investing time into. Examples such as Chihiro and Yuuta gives us a better insight of Kondou\u2019s personal life outside of his workplace. Even a character such as Kase can be interesting to watch despite my personal dislike of his interactions with Akira. In essence, the main characters easily carry this series while others play valuable roles to influence their choices. The series remains faithful to their personalities too based on the manga.\\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni takes the approach of bringing mostly drama so if you\u2019re a viewer interested in such genre, then this will be a wonderful treat for you. The title translates to \u201cAfter the Rain\u201d and literally, there\u2019s plenty that falls. In literature and storytelling, this symbolizes for depression as it\u2019s what see from Akira\u2019s perspective in the beginning of the show. Still, there\u2019s light comedy with some hilarious moments too for those who think this may be just a drama fest. \\n\\n\r\nThe main selling point of the series is undeniably the character chemistry between Akira and Kondou. It\u2019s hard to ever forget about these two even when episodes doesn\u2019t fully concentrate on them. That brings in the question if you think they do or don\u2019t get together. As a 1 cour adaptation (12 episodes), the show can feel more like a titanic ship tease with how the series delivers its storytelling. It\u2019s obvious the show won\u2019t have a concrete conclusion as the anime couldn\u2019t cover every chapter. However, from a fictional storytelling viewpoint, this series is what I view as drama done right. The emotional moments looks impactful and holds special meaning for the characters. I can\u2019t remember how many times I replayed certain scenes to get a better look at how the characters behave and why they do so in such ways. Plus, I think this show really delivers the promise of its premise without ever being distracting. The only time I do find a character distracting is perhaps Takashi as he\u2019s there for more as comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nAs a studio that produced mostly fantasy themed series, Wit Studio was definitely not a choice that I was expecting. However, I\u2019m highly pleased to say that they aced this with flying colors in terms of production quality. The scenery in this show looks incredibly well-polished and show their effort through the realistic setting with rich details. These scenes also delivers a melancholic tone that you\u2019d fully expect out of this show such as the smiling and crying. The key animation and choreography makes this show sometimes look like a moving painting. Every emotional segment looks impactful through its tone and captures the importance of human feelings. Scenes such as Akira running under the rain or the bittersweet moments when she feels heavy emotions is bought out through the talents of this show\u2019s creative team. The theme songs contain great usage of sequences to show creativity while the visual style of the character designs bring the cast to life. A beautiful girl like Akira deserved such treatment.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t too convinced into the character behaviors in this show until I heard the voices of the cast. Sayumi Watabe may not have an impressive resume but she is able to step into the shoes of Akira perfectly. The way her character speaks brings truth to her personality while showcasing a more delicate side when she\u2019s with the manager. I also felt how real the character cast were whenever they interacted under different circumstances. As a show with heavy drama, Aimer\u2019s performance is nothing short than a spectacle. \u201cRef:rain\u201d felt like one of the most memorable ED theme songs of this year so far with how melancholic it\u2019s performed. The choreography and mood of the sequences captures the series\u2019 themes at its fullest. Besides that, I think the overall usage of the OST in this series also brings in memorable moments. Between quiet moments of melancholy to more dramatic segments, it\u2019s easily acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think this show did just about everything it was set up to do and that\u2019s to deliver a drama story with realistic human feelings. What started off as two seemingly lovebirds connecting from a workplace turned into complicated storyteller. I\u2019m more than pleased that this got an anime adaptation in the first place. It felt more like a series suited to air on live action TV as a drama. However, Koi wa Ameagari no You ni lives up to its promise and made a show that\u2019s as real as it can be.\\n",

            "content": "It all started with a broken ankle and faithful encounter over coffee.\r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nSimple, sweet, makes my heart flutter. Like pumpkin custard pudding or black and white cats with white socks or chocolate banana crepes.\r\nThis blissful story follows our main protagonist, Akira Tachibana, through her life as a 17 year old high school student. Though she used to be the top athlete in track and field at her school unfortunately after an injury she no longer runs. This has changed her high school life as she overcomes broken relationships and creates new ones.\r\nDuring a faithful encounter on a rainy day, Kondou meets Tachibana and it giveslife to the girl with the broken ankle. With nothing else to do in her high school life she gets a job working with her boss, Kondou, who she secretly has a huge crush on.\\n\\n\r\nAt the Garden Cafe she finds a new meaning to happiness and looks forward to working with everyone there. Or, that is what she thought. Apparently having a crush on your boss, and working along side the boy who has a crush on you is harder than it looks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe art is very pleasing to look at. Often reminding me of old anime styles, giving a soft nostalgic feeling. It may have nothing special to it but if you look closely you can see how elegant the designs in her eyes are. Especially during heart fluttering moments, the anime wastes no time in showing us her emotions through the art, as if it had a daydream effect. Beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nIn 2018, I vote the intro and outro songs as best opening and ending. I fell in love with the way they played out, gives me nostalgic feelings to past anime. Apart from the theme songs the background music gives a subtle flare of summer vacation when I was in high school. I can really hear everything happening around the busy city Tachibana lives in as if I were there.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is nothing special about the amazing sounds most anime produce nowadays. I still love it and give my applause to how far it has come.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nAkira Tachibana, aside from her normal life she is a serious and awkward teen who might seem too uptight but is just shy. Aside from being shy, when she smiles I bet she could light up a room. Especially the way the anime lights up my screen during heartwarming moments. The anime portrays subtle clues that she is lonely and she isolates herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe loves rainy days the most out of anything, on the other hand Kondou does not like rainy days.\\n\\n\r\nKonou Masami is her manager who has a bald spot on the back of his head. He is just as socially awkward as Tachibana. Often having to frantically apologize for everything, he definitely shows the father in him. He should since he does have a son and is divorced. One could picture how lonely he must be living alone and working much harder than he should. \\n\r\nOne thing is for certain, there are many more things to him that meet the eye than being an \"old man\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode I jumped right into the ongoing manga series. Although a lot is portrayed differently in the anime than the manga it is still played out nicely. They add quite a bit to the managers personality into the anime and I can definitely agree with their decision. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, I don't enjoy watching adaptations from manga I have read. I find it easy to watch Koi wa Ameagari no You ni without being bored, it makes me smile unexpectedly.\\n\r\nTo think that all of this happened because of a broken ankle.",

            "content": "[Indirectly spoils the ending, and possibly other elements of the show.  This is the sort of thing that's hard to avoid in reviews, and which I don't think should necessarily be avoided.  Consider yourself forewarned.]\r\nToday, I want to write about love.  It's no coincidence that this show is about love and writing, and the love of writing, among other things, because I don't often write in the first place.  From time to time, I find that there are some shows which evoke certain feelings, or thoughts, that I have to write about them.  This is one of those shows.\r\nThere aremany kinds of love.  The advertising for this show, and its OP/ED, focus largely on the romantic kind.  It's almost a shame, because the show focuses mostly on the love of hobbies or work.  Akira and Masami are the kind of people who have lost sight of their passions for one reason or another.  Akira gave up on running due to an injury.  Masami gave up on writing because of a lack of success and the hardship it brought on his family.\\n\\n\r\nIt's frequently difficult to pursue these passions.  It's also not easy giving up on a thing you feel so strongly about, or dealing with the regret of having done so.  That said, wouldn't you be happier doing the former, given that it's a thing you enjoy anyway?  It's a hard question for a lot of people, and like most real-world problems, there isn't one right answer for everyone.  There's a catch to this dilemma, though.  A person who doesn't really want to give up and walk away from his dream simply shouldn't.  He might still do it, though, for one reason or another.  In this case, wouldn't someone who encouraged him to follow his dreams be making his life demonstrably better?  In that case, isn't it better to be with that person?\\n\\n\r\nThis is the essence of human relationships, in the end.  \"Romantic love\" is something that mostly exists only in fiction, and this show isn't interested in perpetuating the fantasy.  However, love itself is real enough, and this show sets out to explore it.  In this case, it starts out in what's basically the most straightforward way.  Akira is physically attracted to Masami.  I consider this much to be clear, though many things in the show are presented nonverbally, and thus up to interpretation.  It's less clear how Masami feels about Akira, especially at first.  I got a similar impression from him that I got from Kyon.  Namely, that he's prone to self-deception.  That's why it's so refreshing that Akira is so honest about how she feels about most things.  This is why it tears at my heart to see her lie to herself, and to others, about the most important one.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, this was a very emotional show for me.  I cried at the finale, which is already rare enough, but it was a different kind of cry.  These were tears of joy; the joy of experiencing something truly beautiful.  I don't consider this to be an accident.  Where many shows would generally be content to tell you what their characters are feeling, or use some kind of established visual shorthand, this show tries to make those emotions visually apparent, and to impart certain feelings onto the viewer.  Nonverbal communication is inherently risky, and I've always admired shows that rely on it and succeed.  This show likes its metaphors, visual and otherwise.  I've long known that Wit Studio has some talented animators, and has a passion for making visually beautiful shows.  It's wonderful to see them take that energy and talent, and use it for a clear purpose.  I'd also like to credit the background artists, because their work is stellar, but I know almost nothing about this element of anime production.  It's also no coincidence that the music is very good; I've often considered this to be the most emotional part of the experience of watching anime.  Even what I thought might be a flaw, that the music is somewhat repetitive, may in fact be a motif, which again serves a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI love this show.  It really speaks to me.  It fits my ideals for what an anime should be, and its theme and some of its trappings appeal to me personally.  Its ending exceeded whatever hopes I might have had for it.  It's not very interesting to talk about its personal appeal to me, since the reader's life experience and situation will certainly be different than mine, but it's there.  That said, I feel confident that this show's more objective merits are strong enough that I could recommend it to anyone.  I hope you love it as much as I do, because in the end, we're better off being happy.  (Sorry, Chihiro!  No poison today.)",

            "content": "After the Rain, an anime full of imagery, symbolism, a mildly controversial plot, and hot track anime girls... I mean, two characters at the crossroads of their lives.\r\nAfter the Rain could have stood to be more ambitious. It plays it so safe and measured that for long stretches of time I was asking myself why I was watching this, or why anyone was watching it.\r\nThe premise can be a little dicey and most of the fan dialogue around this show will mostly be concerning \"the implications of dating someone old enough to be your parent\", The protagonist/MC: Akira Tachibana, is in a bit of aslump. Her Achilles injury has caused her to quit track-and-field and she fills the void by working a part-time job where she continually grows infatuated with her boss(Mr. Kondo).\\n\\n\r\nNow let me be clear. I am analyzing this show on its artistic merits, the controversy surrounding its premise does not really bother me. In fact - I liked it. What I had problems with was the execution. A younger woman attracted to an older man is probably more common than people would like to admit. With that being said, I wish the subject matter was handled... better. After the Rain is cautious and measured; the characters don't get too physically intimate, they never even inched upon the possibility of having a relationship. The mangaka knew exactly what she is going for, and so does the audience. This is never going to end in a declaration of love, but rather it will be a story about both characters working through their emotional baggage.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the rain displayed small windows of great narrative potential. There are great moments of this shows and things that I could enjoy. There is symbolism through imagery and explicit dialogue(i.e. Rashomon, the bookmark). This series also contains parallelism, insofar as Kondo and Tachibana are going through very similar ordeals in their life. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem arises insofar as this shows feels like a bait-and-switch. The episodes seem like it will be an emotionally explorative piece with the focal point being a relationship with this oblivious middle-aged man and Akira; y'know what? I was onboard with that.  However, those elements of the show were constantly undercut by the more slice-of-life elements that feel meandering in nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe two leads grow closer together with Akira pretty aggressively pursuing Kondo. This consist of walking his kid home, nursing him back to health, and chance coincidences. The thing about this, is the setup relied on chance encounters and circumstances. The way the relationship progresses in the story, while seeming natural gives off this unnatural caution that disrupts the tone of this show, and is an example of the mangaka keeping the cards too close to her chest. It never felt like there were any stakes in their friendship/relationship with each other. In fact, it never really felt like this was anything besides a one-sided relationship. Akira has feelings for Kondo and he kind of entertains her. There never was any substantive connection, which was the huge nail in the coffin for me because you are clearly supposed to be rooting for these two.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not helped by the fact that Tachibana may be one of the worst MC's I have seen in awhile. She is not even one note, but rather a complete, wholesale lack of a personality. She usually just stares, maybe says one or two words(exaggeration), and walks in the rain when she is sad.\\n\\n\r\nAkira is oftentimes the center of attention, and the show goes out of the way to make it clear that she is attractive, the star/former star of the track team, and is too good for all those other girls. This series feels more like a shoujo then a seinen insofar as it is framed in the female psyche and female emotions. In some sense, I don't want to talk about it because that level of wish fulfillment is in every show these days. However, I have not seen many people broach the topic, so why not start here?\\n\\n\r\nIt is not necessarily a huge problem, but there were so many unbelievable scenarios regarding their taboo relationship. After the Rain has a hard time selling the audience on basic suppositions that you have to accept in order for this series to work, it also has a poor time portraying male characters in a completely believable way. An example of the latter point being a scene in episode 1, Kondo apologizes to a bratty customer and an older co-worker of Tachibana snarkily remarks \"he is such a pushover, he has no spine\", mind you Kondo is a manager. A manager in the service industry...\\n\\n\r\nI felt early on that there was something \"off \" about the way Kondo is characterized. Kondo needs to be a pushover for the foundation of his \"I have to entertain this girl\" mentality to be believable. It just did not add up to me. Kondo is a full grown adult, he has been in college, he manages a successful restaurant, he has had a marriage that ended in divorce, he has a son, he has a full set of responsibilities. A full plate if you will. None of that aligns with a friendship with a younger co-worker of the opposite sex. This show speaks to that notion that \"age is just a number\", but scenes with Kondo walking in on her sniffing his shirt, them going to restaurants together, and continually meeting up just seems so out of line with everything we know about him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best moments of this was in episode 3 when Kondo flat out told her \"you should reconsider all this\", it is how these types of situations would unravel, and to keep it brief; I don't see a man of Kondo's temperament, personality, and sensibilities not just telling Tachibana to leave him alone.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was entertaining and I usually can find something every season that is watchable. That is this show for me, and the mediocrity of this is only accentuated by the fact that so many shows come out every season that I can recount that was worth more time and attention than this. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Love is like After the Rain. In the midst of stormy conditions you can either comfortably wait inside until the weather dies down or choose to face it head-on, pressing forward through the torrent and seeing where it takes you. Similarly, passion is like after the rain; once drowned out it can leave you confounded and lost with grey clouds hanging overhead. What once before had consumed one\u2019s lifestyle is suddenly pulled away, no longer part of who they are and now must come to terms with this. In After the Rain we are shown two characters, each on the surface seem completely different toone another but upon closer inspection share a comparable suffering \u2013 they are both burdened with the feelings of a lost passion.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nHigh-school sophomore Akira Tachibana is obliged to give up track-and-field after suffering a torn Achilles tendon. Up until this point, running had been part of her life since her earliest memories, almost becoming an instinctual part of her. Now having been ripped away from her passion she finds herself detached from her past world; stumbling along mere sidewalks by her lonesome self, enveloped in a constant downpour that doesn\u2019t appear to let up anytime soon. Akira as shown on numerous occasions is very emotionally-driven, her feelings never bottled up and always fuelling her actions. Now facing the reality of her situation alone, she is at the lowest she has ever been. But one day, whilst sitting inside a family restaurant staring out at the rain, the manager approaches her with a cup of coffee on the house, performs a cute magic trick before saying to her:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s boring when you\u2019re just waiting for the rain to stop. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll stop raining soon.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis alongside his act of kindness captures her heart and results in Akira developing a childlike crush on the man, subconsciously filling the void her injury left with an almost unhealthy love for Masami Kondo, the manager over twice her own age. Going so far as working under him at that very restaurant, becoming more and more committed in confessing her feelings to the man. Considering the subject matter, this series walks on very thin ice with focusing on an implied romance between a young girl and a middle-aged man, even testing the waters at times with her confession leading to a date between the two. But where many other series would have faltered, After the Rain handles this relationship with a level of grace and tactfulness rarely found in anime. It evolves from a simple age-gap romance generally considered taboo to deliver on a tale that focuses on the couple as individuals, each having lost something integral to themselves in the past and are both still learning to cope with.\\n\\n\r\nMasami Kondo may seem a typical kind man on first impression but his life up to this point has been far from what he once hoped for. He is constantly burdened by what could have been \u2013 an avid writer in his youth whose material unfortunately never gained popularity and coupled with a failed marriage, leaves him with an attitude of complacency. His adoration for writing heavily implied as the driving force behind his divorce and losing custody of their child, a tragic turn of events that left his family broken and eventually caused him to abandon his writing. Now whenever his past career work is challenged, he simply blames it on age and sees any serious attempt to change such is inconsequential. He is content in reminiscing about the love he once had bitter-sweetly, afraid of potentially tainting the memories he still cherishes.\\n\\n\r\nBoth our main characters have felt the pain their passions led them to, Akira physically with a severe injury and Kondo emotionally with his family fractured in the process. Both are pushed away from what they lost and have grown fearful of the hole left in their place, afraid of ever returning to them. Kondo is fine reading the words of others and scribbling down notes when working, but at his desk with pen in hand he can only stare at the sheet in front of him, his thoughts never put to paper. Alongside being reminded of his past failings in the form of his highly-successful college friend, he is unable to take that step towards rekindling his passion. Akira is still willing to talk with her friends on the track team, but now doing so is coupled with a feeling of disconnect and angst, stranded alone and forced to watch their practice from the sidelines. Every time she tries to run she\u2019s left injured in the process by her lost love, akin to an abusive relationship she just cannot seem to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nOn that day when Kondo offered her coffee they were only strangers, unaware of what has happened in the other person\u2019s life. What Kondo did know however was the look in her eyes; the longing gaze of someone who\u2019s lost and mourning something important to them. He knows it because it\u2019s the kind of look he shows whenever alone. Staring into the rain at night with cigarette in hand, reflecting on what he once had, his position in life and how he ended up there. Despite the difference in age Kondo is able to empathize with Akira, birthing a stronger connection between the pair from the parallels of their situations. A crush from the teenage girl does initially result from this and while there are moments throughout the show that hint towards romantic feelings being returned by Kondo, the overall approach is cautious and thoughtful. Her fondness for Kondo is illustrated as simply infatuation born out of immaturity and never becomes a path to shape her future. Not only are her feelings never taken advantage of by the older man, but what began as a school-girl affection morphs into a deep mutual respect and understanding between two damaged people.\\n\\n\r\nLove is like After the Rain, but not in a romantic sense. Instead it aspires to depict the rekindling of a lost love that has plagued both Akira and Kondo\u2019s lives. Here lies a story of two people with their own problems that are able to help each other work through them. Allusions are a core aspect of the series used to convey the issues each main character faces, both visually and metaphorically. When referring to the short story \u201cRashomon\u201d, Kondo suggests he is too far gone to try writing once again, claiming he is not the protagonist and does not possess the energy or determination required for it. In response Akira tells him that his regrets aren\u2019t something to wallow in, instead use them as motivation to return to that love that constantly spurred him on. For Akira, her fears of running again are finally addressed when having a conversation around a swallow that had trouble leaving the nest. Asked if the bird could have been happy staying behind in the nest, Kondo asserts that while there might be happiness found, it would forever look up and long for the skies. These moments end up being the push both needed to take the next step forward in their lives. Both have realised they each have a lot to work on as individuals and neither are ready to give up on the dreams they hold dearly in their hearts yet. And so, they each go their separate ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs the end credits roll, a melancholic theme plays set to a race track flooded with rain, only to transform into a bright one as the sun breaks through the clouds whilst the tune meets its climax. It\u2019s a gorgeous representation for how the series closes with both Akira and Kondo coming out of the storm stronger than before, ready to face their passions once more. No matter how long darkness and feelings of uncertainty loom over, there will surely be a light that follows. Amidst the rain seeds of romance were planted, but now that the rain is over do they have the chance to flourish. Whether their relationship still holds romantic love or not remains to be seen. But from a year praised as one of the best for anime, I know there\u2019s at least one show from that year I still hold great fondness for.\\n",

The main female character is 17, which means she's of legal age of consent in most western countries. I'm sure you'll all behorrified to hear that 17 year old's do sometime fantasize about older adults...clutch those pearls!\\n\r\nNow that the arbitrary excuse for not watch it has been dealt with I'd like to make to case for this anime. I've found it to be one of the most engaging series this season. It's at time funny, dramatic, heartwarming and treats its subject matter very seriously.\\n\r\nIf you have your doubts please watch up to, and including, episode 7. I promise you that you will not be disappointed. there is something very poignant about the contrast between an adult who's dreams have been crush by the passage of time but who, nonetheless, remains kindhearted, running headlong into the intense passions of a young adult experiencing her first love in the face of a life changing event.",

            "content": "One look into the premise of this show is enough to turn people off; A high school girl finds herself crushing on a man in his mid-forties who ends up being her boss at the restaurant where she works after class. Japan has no shortage in that kind of unpleasant male-wish-fulfilment fantasy in the anime industry\u2014the older-man-younger-woman \u201cforbidden love\u201d type of tale. The execution of Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After the Rain), from Jun Mayuzuki's manga of the same name, makes it less of a #MeToo story than one about two broken hearts at very different, but equally important, stages of their livesand where they intersect. What starts as an unlikely romance becomes a more aspiring story about one\u2019s unfulfilled dreams leading another to re-evaluate the broken connections of their own life.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain is made unique by the unlikely relationship between the two leading characters. A beginner when it comes to love, Akira Tachibana is emotion-driven, fuelled by her feelings and almost fiercely expresses them instead of bottling things up. Her long-time love for running having been sidelined due to a recent injury, her fiery passion is suddenly redirected towards her crush and part-time job manager, Masami Kondou. The embodiment of youth, she is the spitting image of a High school girl in love. Eager to please yet saddened by life, Masami, keeps a friendly facade without ever displaying an inch of bitterness. His own dreams having been buried many years ago, he\u2019s labelled himself content with life as is. With Akira and Masami having lost a part of themselves at one point in time, they indirectly become what the other needs whether it be the liveliness of youth or the quiet maturity of life experience. As for Masami, he is clearly aware of how inappropriate a relationship with Akira would be, but her attention does help him remember\u2014and revive\u2014his own youthful dreams of becoming a writer. For Masami, too, Akira is less a realistic romantic choice than a totem representing what\u2019s been lost\u2014and what might be found again.\\n\\n\r\nAkira was a track-and-field ace at her school, she tore her Achilles tendon which put a halt to her goals. Now her after-school hours are spent taking orders at a casual dining restaurant called, \u201cGarden.\u201d Masami, a mid-forty-year-old with a self-deprecating laugh and a goofy, positive attitude about everything. They are the complete opposite, the excitable man with a silent midlife crisis, and a reserved young lady who has a fire burning inside her youthful dreams. What ignited this relationship were two events, first being a rainstorm and a cup of coffee while the latter was a confession. Both of these moments happened early within the story, this way, it has more dedicated time in testing the feelings and emotions of these characters. There is something about Masami that has captured Akira's attention and affection, and she believes that whatever it is, it's worth knowing and nurturing. Can we call this a woman\u2019s intuition? Instincts, not logical deductions. Akira is drawn to the fact that he has a need, and she does not yet understand that need is not a romantic one. More so a spiritual one. It's because once was a time that Masami had dreams of being something else, doing other things, and in the time since he has settled for so much less. Just as she has. \\n\\n\r\nThe story being lived out mainly from Akira\u2019s standpoint, with some back and forth with insights into Masami\u2019s life and past. There is a sheer weight of insight that the story provides about its characters.  There\u2019s so much about this series that\u2019s so truthful, so beautiful and so on-point\u2014it impacts you in the way only stories that enlighten our actual lives can impact you. Our protagonists are multi-dimensional characters that go through a lot of development, a lot of relatable high and low\u2019s. Then they begin to let each other into their respective hearts, and Akira thinking about Masami goes from crushing on him to knowing someone whose dreams have also dwindled. When this change goes into play, it affects her on multiple fronts. It not only changes her relationship with Masami, but it also alters her relationship with her close friend Haruka. They were two peas in a pod, drawn together with their love and passion for running, but they drifted apart after Akira's injury. Masami also deals with a real-world issue like Akira when it comes to raising his son in a shared-parenting situation with his ex-wife, the pain of the divorce still lingers with him and both help each other when they confront these problems.\\n\\n\r\nWhen two people show up on stage together and the result is a special \u201cspark,\u201d you know you\u2019re seeing character chemistry. Chemistry is the \u201cit\u201d factor in all great fiction and that is exactly what Akira and Masami share, this is the main point that makes this anime amazing. They both light up the room\u2014amp up each other\u2019s energy, instantly making each other happy, and make it easy for one another be their best self along with their vulnerable self. Both respond to one another according to any number of social and subliminal signals that end up creating paradigms that belong uniquely to them. It\u2019s a subtle dance, in which they take cues from one another, testing out their moves, discovering to what degree they can unleash the full power of their personalities in an ever-shifting dynamic of opposition and harmony. There is also a supporting cast that helps give Akira and Masami an impact in their decisions when needed, while they aren\u2019t fleshed out, they do play pivotal roles and give the story a much-needed change of mood and pace without it feeling out of place. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s common in love tales in anime is that romance is an ingredient and not a subject, normally used in a way to pull laughter and tears from the viewers. Things aren\u2019t interesting by default because the characters in it are in love; the same goes for the characters themselves. But every now and then get a series that is about the way love is awkward, difficult and self-contradictory and not just a showcase for those things. It is hard to depict characters in love, there is a great risk of looking less impressive and blinded by love, instead of being empowered and uplifted by it. After the Rain\u2019s method of showing how its characters are made better by what they feel Is best portrayed in this particular element that stands out from the rest. Twice Akira visualizes about having an embrace-and-kiss moment with Masami\u2014the first happened earlier on after a date and once more at the very end of the show after she has run out after to give him some documents. But both times, we get the reality of things and not what Akira fantasizes, each going their separate way by themselves, while no longer alone, knowing they have each other as an aspirational strength in their lives. \\n\\n\r\nWit Studio perfectly adapted this series, their works made After the Rain into a more memorable, enjoyable and mesmerizing experience. While remaining somewhat loyal to the manga, Wit\u2019s own take on character design brings extra elements when it comes to general appearance and personality. Referencing a modern take on a 90\u2019s anime art style while keeping an intriguing illustrative format pushes the art to the same level of importance as the narrative, having them compete for the spotlight. The animation has great fluidity, the colour scheme has all shades of human emotion and feelings, all the fine details in the background and various locations bring the setting in a bustling city to life. The director in Ayumu Watanabe gives it the little touches that colour in the spaces between the emotional frames, and that gives Akira and Masami\u2019s story it\u2019s astonishing depth and realism. He was able to illuminate the \u201cShow, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach effectively where a single moment provokes numerous emotions and can tell a story on its own. Each episode works in this format where the first part builds towards something while the latter part concludes with an influential and impactful crescendo that feels like a little film in itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is gorgeous and outstanding. Ryo Yoshimata\u2019s thick atmospheric background music\u2014which is definitely one of the best for 2018\u2014paired with Ayumu\u2019s direction and Wit\u2019s glorious artwork makes After the Rain the complete package. The voice actors are a perfect pitch and are irreplaceable. The OP \"Nostalgic Rainfall\u201d by CHiCO with HoneyWorks plays on the innocent crush that Akira has for Masami, it has a happy, playful and upbeat tone that sets the romantic mood. The ED \"Ref:rain\" by Aimer is a more very meaningful and emotional ballad. It perfectly portrays a more accurate picture of the series, that is something greater and deeper than just an unlikely romance. The lyrics touch on yearning desires, farewells, mourning the loss of good things in your life while being left with the bad\u2014along with imagery of a dark and rainy track field, then the song hits the climax when it finishes its slow transformation into a bright and sunny one. It\u2019s one of the best ED song choices and visual pieces I have seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThere is this quote from the series that I loved, it really highlights the message of After the Rain, \u201cThe swallow knows that / Any place where you won\u2019t get wet from the rain / Will also have no sunlight.\u201d It\u2019s a very powerful and beautiful moment, one that definitely represents self-reflection and healing\u2014For both Akira and Masami, knowing that someone will love and accept them unconditionally, without judgment, for who they are is surely going to give them the courage and determination to follow their heart once more. They discover each other in a lonely world and giving that gift to the other. Once broken, two hearts beat as one.\\n",

            "content": "After the Rain takes the idea of slice of life and romance to a very different, analogous level. You have two people adrift in the world disconnected from their passion, if not obsession, in life. The story is as much about the intense, irrational emotions of youth as well as the surrender of dreams. It is two unlikely people connecting in the face of similar despair with young love as the rocket fuel catalyst. Two people who find they need each other in unexpected ways.\r\nThe shaping of the characters is one of my favorite subtleties of this series. Akira is single minded, intense and downright forceful, which lends to the humor of the show. She is robbed of her greatest joy and focus of that intensity, which, to me, shows the level of devastation she is going through dealing with the loss and her keen focus on Kondo. Kondo is the end result of a failed passion; plodding through life as a cog in a role that doesn't suit him while keeping his passion at arms length. The episode where Kondo helps Akira with her Rashomon homework is almost a perfect summary of this entire series, including Kondo's joyful response to being able to see the characters from multiple perspectives. It's also a bit of recognition that this series follows, or at least borrows, those Japanese literary roots. In particular, the ambiguous nature of Rashomon ending.  \\n\\n\r\nWith no offense intended to some younger viewers (or those who haven't had your face dragged through the gravel of life . . . yet), I think us more \"experienced\" people can appreciate this quite a bit more. Just like Kondo, we can remember those heated passions, for better or worse, of our youth, as well as the excitement of reigniting a long dormant passion.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the story is nothing less than I expected; satisfying, sad, poignant.  The story likely resonates with different people in different ways depending where one is in life, which makes the story all the more vibrant.     \\n\\n",

            "content": "When I look back on this show after everything has concluded, I find my thoughts to be at odds. On one hand, I really loved the way Akira and Kondou\u2019s relationship was handled and developed over the season. On the other, I felt as if the show lost momentum when it focused on their interactions with the supporting cast. \r\nFor those of you expecting a straight age gap romance plot, I\u2019m here to tell you now you\u2019re going to be disappointed. The romance ends up being the lens through which to tell a story about two people confronting their inner struggles and how those inevitablyshape their identity. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a leg injury that leaves Akira unable to run for months on the track team, she finds solace in working at a family restaurant whose manager has caught her interest. She sees Kondou as a responsible, compassionate, humble, and mature man. She would be hard-pressed to find someone with those same qualities in her high school environment. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the age differential, she moves forward in her attempts to start a romantic relationship with him. In the beginning, this is the main focal point. Akira makes many moves to slowly become closer with Kondou and this, in turn, puts him in an awkward spot as not only someone much older than her but as her manager as well. Kondou sees himself as just a deadbeat father working a modest living in the service industry. It\u2019s tough for him to turn down Akira\u2019s affections when she\u2019s such a charming girl. You really root for her because of how genuine she is with her feelings. Of course, it helps that she\u2019s a real head turner too.\\n\\n\r\nAs Kondou tries to contextualize Akira\u2019s love to her so that she might stop looking at him in a romantic sense, he unwittingly starts to rediscover his youth. He views Akira as this naive beautiful young woman with so much potential. She is a mirror reflecting his past as a young man charging straight into love without a second thought. Reminded also of the literature he once threw himself into which he no longer pursues. Exploring this youth and the feelings that come with it, the plot\u2019s focus begins to shift and ultimately we get to the true heart of the show. Upon realizing that Akira is potentially exhausting her youth on him he maneuvers to distance and reposition himself as a supporting figure in her life. More a good friend than a lover. It\u2019s painful knowing those feelings won\u2019t be reciprocated but Akira learns to accept the reality as things progress.\\n\\n\r\nAfterward, Akira starts to really think about her love for running again and Kondou does the same revisiting his writing passions through an old friend. Now, this is where the show sort of dipped in momentum for me. Haruka is a girl introduced as Akira\u2019s best friend and teammate on the track team before all this. Several times throughout the show she is presented as this opposing force trying to get Akira back on the track team because of a promise they made when they were younger. There is hinting that she also has somewhat romantic feelings for Akira but that\u2019s less important. I think she was meant to be another pillar of support in line with the way our main characters were changing but she comes off as this passive jealous person who wants her friend back for selfish reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character acting in opposition to the way things were developing is Kase. He\u2019s the restaurant chef and playboy who tries to discourage and mock Akira\u2019s feelings for the manager for one whole episode. His purpose in the show I don\u2019t fully understand because he\u2019s barely shown or mentioned after. I\u2019m actually thankful his interactions were somewhat limited.\\n\\n\r\nThese pauses in the plot, mostly caused by Haruka, were what hurt my overall enjoyment of it. Had Haruka taken more of an active role like Akira in expressing her sentiments and not just stared at her from afar for way too long, maybe she\u2019d be more of a fleshed out and likable character.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s get back on track. As the series came to a close, I felt Kondou and Akira\u2019s relationship was in a great spot and that it was clear skies from there on. I was a bit saddened because if I wanted to know more about the direction it was going in I would have to read the manga. So despite the show\u2019s weaknesses in its supporting character interactions and somewhat disjointed transitions, it was a beautifully animated narrative about two people\u2019s journey to discover themselves and the role that love plays in the process.\\n\\n\r\nIf that sounds like a story worthwhile to you then please give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "Well, for being a romance story between a 45 year old man (Kondo) and a 17 year old girl (Akira), it didn't come off as creepy as I had thought it'd be. I suppose I don't have much moral qualms with it though since 17 is legal in a lot of places... barely. Anyways, I absolutely adored the art style. It's just so pretty, and well executed. I adore all the facial expressions the some of the characters make. I did think some of the pacing is kind of rushed. I did read the first volume of the manga series before this, and it's alot more slow burn than this. Though given this anime only has 12 episodes, maybe this issue is to be expected. I love how the anime slowly unravels details about the characters. We don't learn that Kondo is a writer until way later in the series, though we can see glimpses of that earlier with his novel collection, and poetic way of speaking. I do like how Kondo and Akira help each other grow. Akira is nervous about her drifting friendship with her friend from track since she quit the team. Kondo has a novelist friend from college that he kind of drifted from. Using his experience with his friend, he consoles her about her friendship, and it's just so nice. One thing about Kondo's character is his insecurities with his age. He wants to write and feel young again, but doesn't feel confident about it. Akira does see his good points and encourages him to write again, which is also heartwarming. The scene where he hugs Akira for the first time made me cry. Like the buildup was perfect. There is also some symbolism with things like birds, umbrellas, keychains, etc. Which I dig. I like subtle things like that. What's interesting is that there is romantic buildup between Kondo and Akira in the first half of the series, then the second half deals with the personal problems of each character. Though as I mentioned earlier, the two help each other through these problems so it's not like their relationship development is totally abandoned. On one hand, I was craving more romance, but on the other, I sort of like this too because it's very sweet. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think I was able to verbalize why I liked this anime so much very well, but I was really invested in it, and loved every minute of it.",

I'll admit, I was a little apprehensive about reading that it followed a 45 year old man and a 17 year old girl, but this show does an amazing job of not making it weird.\r\nThe animation is also AMAZING. Tachibana's eyes are gorgeous. The rain scenes aren't just randomly added in, they usually happen when something emotional is going on, and watching the rain is so comforting. \r\nOverall, I think it's a nice slice of life anime and even though I wasa little disappointed by the ending because it did not live up to my expectations based off of every other romance I've seen, it was still amazing.",

            "content": "Koi wa Ameagari no You ni: A forced \"Play Safe\"\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni threatened to touch controversial and even delicate topics, but ended up staying in a simple flirtation.\r\nAs I said in my first impressions, this series was presented with a very interesting setting to take us out of the typical high school and introduce us to the world of a family restaurant; In addition, from the beginning, it strongly opted to show us that \"crush\" that Tachibana had for her boss, to the point that even the girl forced the man to notice it.\r\nHowever, already at that moment I noticed that thefact that this series was based on an ongoing manga could lead us to the fateful \"open end\"; and sadly that was just what happened.\\n\\n\r\nBut the worst was not that, but the final episode showed a very big change of pace with respect to the rest of the series; which made it feel too hurried. It was as if you had to relax any tension to be able to close the anime in a neutral point.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that the Manager was already on track to resume his passion for writing and it is also true that Tachibana was getting closer and closer to returning to her beloved athletics and returning to her friendship with Haruka; nevertheless, if we see the rhythm that all the other episodes had, it is impossible not to feel that in the last one it put his foot on the gas pedal.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, all that \"sprint\" ended in a completely anticlimactic outcome that honestly tasted like nothing. This is the great disadvantage of adapting a work that has not finished. Or a large license is taken and an end is shown that can then be refuted by the original material; or an open ending is sought where there is no compromise in the plot to stay true to that material.\\n\\n\r\nIn Koi wa Ameagari no You ni, it takes the second road and that led us to this final \"without salt\" that left little and nothing. Indeed, it is unfortunate that a series where the commitment of the creative team was noted for providing a great product, culminates in this way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there was material to show us a more daring ending, either by continuing to develop the controversial relationship between Akira and Kondo, or by exploring a possible yuri romance between Akira and Haruka. Throughout the season it flirted with both options; although evidently, the emphasis was on the \"crush\" of the protagonist by the manager. Haruka's thing was always more like an unrequited love. However, in the end all this was \"stand by\" because the director opted for a \"play safe\" to avoid running the risk of going against the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the technical section, the design of characters was very attractive and unusual, the soundtrack simply fulfilled (highlighting the ending well above everything else), the animation was one of the best of the season; and the direction did a great job even though a better closing could be done.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to be fair, they had their hands tied. In fact, despite the open end, a sequence imagined by the Manager was included that served as a fan service for all those people who expected greater progress in the romance. Not all directors do that in such scenarios, so the gesture is appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a nice series to watch with an interesting plot that in the end could not progress more due to the restrictions of the original material. It only remains to read the manga to know how this story continues and see what the true outcome of that attractive romance between Tachibana and her Manager will be.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10.",

            "content": "My point of view: I didn't read the manga. (Also, if this happens to be relevant to you, I went into this anime not supporting relationships with age gaps like this one)\r\nStory: Although this anime is considered a romance, I honestly like how the main relationship was already set up to fail. The main character was a confused young teen who \"fell\" in love with a goofy guy in his 40's. Rather than progressing their \"romantic\" relationship, they explored the factors behind it. Why does she believe that she's in love with a middle-aged man she knows nothing about? What happened to make her feelthis way? What do both parties get out of the relationship? Because of this, the characters were really the shining part of this anime. In regards to the story, I felt as though the climax, the conflict, and the conclusion were awfully weak. I've seen slice of life with a more distinct plot than this. In conclusion, the plot was about a relationship destined to fail, and it worked; however, the other elements of the plot were a bit weak.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was glorious. I loved how the art kind of had the aesthetic of the natural beauty after a rain. Sometimes it was dim and gray, but during the more important scenes, it was shiny and bright, almost like the sun was reflecting the image off of a puddle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was how I usually like it, un-recognizably good. The background music was subtle, beautiful, and didn't distract you from the show. However, I feel as though the ending song, Aimer's \"Ref:rain\", was my favorite part of the show. In fact, I feel as though the song gave a better interpretation of the show than the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were really the shining part that, I believe, saved the show. At first, the 2 main characters were just a teenager, Akira, and her crush/boss, Kondou. Throughout the animation, the characterization progresses creating characters who are not only more complex but realistic and relatable. I do, on the other hand, feel as though a lot of the side characters suffered with a lack of development. The lives of these side characters were brought up, but they were missing a special touch: the why behind the behavior. It wasn't even that the characters were flat characters, there was room for development and progression; the anime just passed on the opportunity. Considering how the characters did take a part in the plot, I felt as though they should've had a little more development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Although I was entertained enough to stick with the show, I still felt like my enjoyment was a tid bit above average. It had potential, but I felt as though it missed out on a lot that could've made it better. I was waiting for a break out moment that never really came. A part of me wonders if the manga did a better job of branching out on the plot and other characters.",

            "content": "I was a teenage girl very recently. And based on my own experience, this is the most honest portrayal I've ever seen of what it's like to be a teenage girl in love. It portrays quite openly all the weirdness, misplaced lust, and slight insanity of a young heart's growing pains.\r\n(Maybe it's also a good portrayal of what it's like for all people in general. Or maybe it's not a very good reflection of the majority of people's experience at all. But I just wanted to start off this review by pointing out that I could definitely relate.)\r\nStory: 9\r\nDespite the fact that the main storylinedeals with Akira falling in love with her middle-aged boss, the underlying theme of the story is actually not about that at all. Instead, it's about following or giving up on dreams; how our over-commitment or under-commitment to those dreams affects the way we treat our family and friends; and whether or not youth is truly wasted on the young. The storytelling focuses on the little details, which lent a superb reality and delicacy to an extremely awkward and difficult premise. But I have to commend the treatment of something so awkward and difficult in a way that did not condone it but gently put forth the question of what the characters could possibly get out of it or learn from it.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to combine these and simply say that the beautiful animation is a treat and the extremely well-designed and purposeful sound is sublime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nI've probably pressed the point enough that I was once Akira and that her character showed a raw and honest portrayal of that supremely awkward and sometimes awful stage of learning love (and misplacing it dreadfully). Most of the side characters are pretty standard tropes and functioned pretty well within their role in the story. But Akira's friend Haruka is very well-rounded and relatable and their friendship actually ends up being the most important relationship in the story. Then we have Kondou. His struggle between trying to ward off Akira's advances and a crisis inside him of wishing to regain his lost youth through her is a dangerous but powerful character arc and I thought really well done. Again, the point here is not a love story at all. It's about very real and complex human emotions that cannot be defined in a word. Perhaps they can be called a kind of \"love\" -- but only as subtly and fleetingly as the moment just after the letting up of the rain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nBeing such an awkward and difficult premise, again, this wasn't the most entertaining or fun watch. But I feel like I really gained something other than enjoyment from it and there's nothing wrong with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nAt one point a character says that pure literature should not \"help\" people but instead be a \"poison\" -- Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is, in my opinion, a very powerful and beautiful poison.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, so have patience.  Warning:  spoilers ahead.  I think this anime is very polarizing.  Some will love its visuals, which are very good, and its shift away from a controversial subject that makes them uncomfortable.  Others will see it as a disjointed, poorly plotted story that loses its way after episode 7.  The story advertises itself as a romance between a 17 year old girl and a 45 year old man.  It's clear both from the OP and ED that this is the main audience draw.  \r\nThe story starts with a depressed Akira,apparently a budding track star who has suffered an achilles injury.  She meets Kondo in a restaurant to which she runs to get out of the rain.  Rain is a metaphor here, but the anime hits you over the head with it.  In contrast to Koi Kaze, where wind was used to mark essential turning points, here it is used bluntly as an attempt to convey emotions.  It gets tiring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a classic bait-and-switch.  The tension and best story writing do indeed involve the crush Akira has for the much older manager, a divorcee with a child and a dead-end job, suffering a mid-life crisis.  Being Kondo's age myself, I really empathized with his plight.  A little insight into Japanese society makes clear that the author had no choice but to steer clear from this subject.  Compensated dating is a current social problem in Japan, and the issue of divorce, ironically, is more controversial than incest (at least to the Japanese censors).  The manga, which I have read, and the anime are really two different stories.  The manga is dark, using themes from Japanese culture dealing with Yuki Onna, a ghost -like succubus.  Guess who that is?  It delves more into Kondo's suffering. It's dark and unsatisfying ending has aroused indignation in Japan.  It comes as a gut punch.  I give the author license to draw dark stories, but they must be well-plotted, and the anime, while less dark, does  not meet this criteria.\\n\\n\r\nThe tension between Kondo and Akira ramps up to episode 7, ending with a scene reminiscent of Koi Kaze, for those familiar with that dark masterpiece.  It then goes into an entirely different direction, thus dropping all the tension that drew the viewer to the anime in the first place.  Thus, it fails to resolve the central conflict that held my attention:  how can a much older man in Kondo's state withstand the avid attention of a very beautiful young woman?  In real life, of course, such attention would create a serious internal conflict for the man, even if he had no intention of returning the affection.  Here, it really is not touched upon, except in episode 7, which was brilliantly filmed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 7, the series loses steam as it tries to re-focus to the safer topic of life lessons.  However, good drama is not safe, and it feels like a cop out after all the tension that had been built over the previous episodes.  There is not even a satisfactory explanation for why this relationship was necessary to achieve the changes in the characters' life directions.  A college friend, introduced late in the series, seems to be the primary influence on Kondo.  A friend and Kondo's son seems to have been the tipping point for Akira.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to drop this after episode 10, but I saw it through.  WIT Studio, which produced the series, did an admirable job making the drawn-out manga into a 12 episode anime, and the production values are high.  But it is a half-a-story, and thus earns a 5.",

            "content": "I thought that I would write a review for this anime since the current top review is only based on the first four episodes. The aforementioned review paints an unfair and unrealistic picture of the anime. Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (Koi henceforth) is an anime that gets incrementally better as it continues. \nKoi is a story far more concerned with personal growth and adulthood than the seemingly taboo premise it represents. The umbrella topic of 'adulthood' is explored through character interactions and various symbolic devices. This review will explore the themes and messages of the anime within the categorical confines of: story, art,sound and character.\\n\\n\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\nThe story itself is not overly complex or revolutionary. The narrative explores the increasingly intertwined lives of the male lead (Mr Kondou) and the female lead (Tachibana). Although inherently simple in nature, the story flows well and fits the genre. It has a suitable balance of comedy and drama too. Having said that, some of the earlier episodes do have some borderline unnecessary comedic moments.\\n\\n\nAs alluded to earlier, the story does become more fluid and enjoyable as the anime continues. This fluidity is reflected by the increasingly well-placed symbolism in later episodes. Rain is a recurring motif. Whilst it may represent many things, it adds an appropriate layer of intensity to the storyline and the overall mood without being overbearing.\\n\\n\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\nThe art is polished and easy to look at. Tachibana looks like she would fit well in a shoujo or josei manga/anime at times. This sort of hybrid style does help to make the characters distinctive and memorable.\\n\\n\nWithout spoiling anything, some of the more dramatic/emotional scenes also use different colour palettes and contrasts. Although not a novel technique, it is executed well and adds to the quality of the anime as a whole.\\n\\n\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\nThe OP and ED songs are both nice to listen to. They are memorable and also reflect the duality of happiness and sadness that persists throughout the anime. Some of the soundtracks are ordinary at best but at least one of the sad soundtracks stands out. It fits the bittersweet and sad moments perfectly and adds to the overall emotion of these scenes.\\n\\n\nThe Japanese VAs are acceptable. I would say that Mr Kondou's VA stands out most. The inflection of his voice helps to show the various sides of his character; from being amusingly clumsy to being nihilistically pensive.\\n\\n\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\nAlthough the characters do start off as archetypes, they do grow as the series progresses. This is actually something that pleasantly surprised me while watching.\\n\\n\nA slight caveat however; none of the side characters really stand out. Hence why I have neglected to mention them or discuss them in any depth.\\n\\n\nTachibana- \\n\\n\nShe is a quintessentially na\u00efve 17 year old girl. Although she does distance herself from her school peers, her affection and feelings toward Mr Kondou are very innocent and idealistic. She refuses to think or reflect upon the practical considerations of a potential relationship.\\n\\n\nTachibana is an interesting character because her youthful vigour makes it easy for her to reject social expectations or norms. For instance, she is not bothered by the pervasive taboo of a teenager dating a middle-aged man. Overall, her character provides an interesting contrast to conventional adult cynicism on the topic.\\n\\n\nKondou-\\n\\n\nAt the start, Kondou is just a socially awkward and clumsy middle-aged man and a single father. He exists mainly as the unaware and innocent romantic interest of Tachibana.\\n\\n\nI am wary of spoilers but Kondou grows throughout each episode. Aspects of his past are hinted at throughout the story and his reactions to Tachibana's affection are authentic and believable.\\n\\n\nMuch of the symbolism throughout the story accentuates the relationship between the two characters. At times, the viewer also begins to understand Kondou better through Tachibana's eyes. As part of this process, we also understand Tachibana better and see her grow.\\n\\n\nConcluding thoughts:\\n\\n\nAll in all, I can wholeheartedly recommend Koi. I say this as a harsh critic that generally avoids anything with a hint of romance. Just as one should not judge a book by its cover, I would not judge this anime based on the first few episodes or the premise.\\n",

The show, show us a hard 'slice of life', how dreams affect us as living being who live coexist and don't see on what age we are.\r\nWhat is great about the show is, what i expect the show to be a romance with 'unusual' set and will be have an assured ending. Well, i am really wrong. \r\nRomance is a side genre from this anime, life is the main genre. It tells us how dream canbe a symbol of hope to us, who live without and with obstacles. \\n\\n\r\nwhat makes it even better is all aspect of the anime support the story greatly. The art, sound, and character are well built that makes the anime very eye catching and makes us want to watch it in one sit.\\n\\n\r\nBut the reason why I only give it a 8 and not 9 or 10 is, i'm not really into such 'set', but it kind of blown me away after i finished it.

            "content": "What is \"I love you\"? We know what those words mean, we've seen them, we've heard them and we've read them. And we've spoken them. But do we really understand the value they hold, the weight they pull and the strength they possess? \r\nI started watching this anime with reservations, partly due to the synopsis, but partly due to experience with teen drama anime. And since I finished watching it, a particular question has been circling in my mind - When will it stop raining?\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni is, as the title suggests, a love story. But it's not your typical boy-likes-girl orgirl-likes-boy. No, it's girl-likes-old-man. This might seem off-putting to some but to me it was a deciding factor in this anime's success. But in order for me to express my thoughts further, we'll need to delve a little bit deeper into the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nThe story is about Tachibana - a high school girl who, having suffered from a trauma, has given up on her dream to run and is now casually floating through her youth. That is, until she seeks shelter from the rain in a family restaurant. The manager, a kind and gentle man, offers her a small gesture of hospitality. Which accidentally sparks the flame of love within this pure girl's heart. She then starts working part-time at said restaurant, in order to bridge the gap between her and the manager - Mr. Kondo. The hurdles, however, are many and far in between - an age difference of over 28 years, jealous co-workers and shaky friendships. However, with this being said, it's not only the love side of the story that's facing problem - the various characters also have personal issues to deal with. Tachibana with her longing for her dream of running competitively, yet giving up due to a injury. Mr. Kondo, with his youthful desire to write, yet giving up on it as it drove him apart from the ones he loved. The story takes us on a tearful ride through the many obstacles that await us in life. And, for those of us, lucky enough to encounter that one spark of love, this will be a shot straight through the heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nWhile not being the main selling point if this anime, the art was decent. At time, it felt bland but it served to only paint the main characters in a brighter light. The simplistic facial expression of Mr. Kondo contrasts perfectly the beautiful and smooth characteristics of Tachibana. A drop of beautiful on an otherwise boring and plain canvass.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nUtterly breathtaking. I can't describe how emotionally touched I felt while listening to the ED. And, if I can be selfish for just a moment, I would like to say that, regardless of what anyone says, Aimer's song fits this anime perfectly. There is nothing but pure emotion emanating from every note. No, I'm not crying... I'm NOT, YOU'RE CRYING. SHUT UP!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s) - 8\\n\r\nIf there is an area this anime is weak at, it's this one. While our two main protagonists get lots of screen time and development (rightfully so), the same cannot be said about the rest of the cast, with most of them having brief, if not episodic appearances that, although influence the story going forward, do nothing to further establish themselves and their background. I really liked the exchanges between Kondo and Chihiru and I wished I could have seen more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. The emotional ride it took me is one I never expected to experience going into this. Unlike Violet Evergarden, this anime took a sweet and gentle approach to love. Without needless misunderstandings, without any shock factor, it managed to accomplish so much. If I had to name a scene that will stay with me, it has to be Mr.Kondo embracing Tachibana on that stormy night. It was beautiful. There is nothing wrong with wanting love, there is nothing wrong with wanting a companion, someone who understands you. And, even though he realized himself that his feelings might have been too frivolous to be called love, he still embraced her. That night, he was her umbrella, protecting her from the cold, unforgiving rain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy parting words to those who read so far - give this a shot. Love is something that has no bounds, has no limitations. It is difficult to understand, yet simple to express. It is impossible to describe, yet possible to show. And whether we choose to accept it or deny it, love will be with us, within us - now and forever.",

            "content": "I\u2019m feeling extremely listless approaching this review, because this show, After the Rain, could\u2019ve been one of my favorite anime of all time should it had been executed for my liking\u2026but it wasn\u2019t. \r\n>It\u2019s an age gap romance, which I love; I really get into taboo romances. \r\n>It\u2019s a seinen manga adaptation, which I love; I tend to like shows with more mature, at least somewhat complex themes.\r\n>And lastly, it\u2019s a show that\u2019s all about the theatrics; I find more cinematographic shows to be far more engaging visually, if only for how pretty it is to look at.\r\nUnfortunately, everything was executed in either an anticlimacticor UNFOCUSED manner. This lack of focus will be the focal point to this review:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of After the Rain is very simple. Girl meets Boy, except this time the Boy is a middle aged man and the Girl is a high schooler. Despite the age gap and negative social response that might come from their relationship, Akira, the Girl, couldn\u2019t care less. She goes for the Boy, Kondo, with all her might. It\u2019s very cute and heartwarming to see her hopelessly in love, and her beautiful and expressive character art really carries her solo scenes and monologues, making her relatable for the younger audiences and endearing for the older. Kondo responds to this kindly and appropriately; he empathetically indulges in her advances but makes it clear that they are only friends. Their character chemistry is, again, quite cute and heartwarming to watch. That all being said, it never actually goes anywhere tangibly. This show is painfully quick to haphazardly trail off into side characters\u2019 drama, and to even make the main cast forget their own agendas. For every step Akira and Kondo\u2019s relationship goes forwards, side characters drag them backwards two steps, and it gets\u2026annoying. It becomes genuinely annoying, and that frustration really lingered on throughout the series all the way to the finale. \\n\\n\r\nThe message of After the Rain is also very simple. Follow your dreams, yes, but don\u2019t be afraid to move on with life and maybe find some new dreams once you learn more about yourself; there\u2019s a difference between pursuing a different path and straight up quitting. Akira had previously been the star of the track team and Kondo had previously been the happy-go-lucky family man, but both of those lives had recently ended due to a leg injury and a divorce respectively. While they both deeply care for their \u201cpast lives\u201d, they are also happy with their new lives of working together at a family restaurant and peacefully pursuing newfound passions: Kondo has rediscovered his college passion for writing, and Akira has discovered her passion for, well, Kondo. Naturally, the drama is born from their inner conflicts and relevant side characters forcing them to choose a side within themselves. Unlike the tangible story that goes absolutely nowhere, the messages are quite well sent, and the reason this show still gets a positive review in my book. I honestly think the two MCs taught me a little bit about myself over the course of the show, and that\u2019s something I hold dear. \\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of After the Rain is, you guessed it, also very simple. The direction is shot around the character\u2019s emotions, and scenes are composed in an almost POV perspective where you\u2019re viewing the world the way the character in focus does. Have you ever read a manga that gave POV chapters to certain characters every once in a while? After the Rain is directed like one of those chapters except for literally every scene. The upsides to this are the same as the downsides: when a scene is shot from Akira or Kondo\u2019s perspective it feels hyper-immersive and the gorgeous visuals and high production value work together to let you know exactly what they\u2019re thinking and to truly understand their mindsets, but it\u2019s absolutely wasted when a scene is shot from Random Side Character X\u2019s perspective because we know absolutely nothing about them and the effects do little more than confuse the audience. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can almost certainly tell, I loved this show in concept and was consistently frustrated by it\u2019s execution. The plot was almost totally static, which was even more apparent when they\u2019re delivering the thematic depth so well because you can\u2019t help but think, \u201cOkay, well if you understand this so well then why don\u2019t you do SOMETHING with your situation?!\u201d. I don\u2019t know; maybe I\u2019m impatient; maybe I\u2019m too nitpicky; maybe I missed the forest for the trees on this one. Either way, I enjoyed After the Rain for the main cast, and I think you will too, but if you\u2019re as impatient, nitpicky, and possibly dense as I am, then I\u2019m afraid this show will do little more than perturb you when viewing, even if you do find provocative themes and messages in your own reflection and hindsight like I did.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading. \\n\\n\r\nNote: The mods took this down because someone thought I posted early. I didn't. I watched it on KissAnime (because Amazon was always late) the morning it aired just like everyone else, but shit happens I guess. I just wanted to thank the thirty-something people who upvoted this originally. I doubt any of them will ever see this, but I wanted to thank them somewhere.",

            "content": "At a glance, Love is Like After the Rain seems like a romantic drama focused on a high school student named Akira who develops a crush on her boss, a middle-aged restaurant manager named Kondo, after he cheers her up from feeling depressed after having to leave her school's track team due to injury. The series devotes a good deal of focus on the chemistry between Akira and Kondo as the former's interest in Kondo develops and the relationship between them develops into something closer. To the anime's credit in this case, the series is rather sensible in approaching the relationship developments as they staygrounded and don't get too questionable or overly dramatic in their developments.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as episodes progress, the series does gradually provide more fleshing out on Kondo's character and viewers will come to learn that he has a similar situation as Akira he faced in his youth over having an interest he finds himself feeling forced out of due to a personal issue. Rather than an age-gap relationship, After the Rain's main focus is actually on exploring Akira and Kondo dealing with personal interests they struggle with trying to get back into due to their personal dilemmas. While Kondo's experience with the situation has led him to reflect on it, the situation is a new one for Akira to cope with in her youth and as episodes progress, the series shows that the crush she has on her manager may not be one due to romantic implications. The series takes the time to explore the issues effecting both characters and how both are handling them throughout the course of After the Rain, with the relationship between the two due to both actually feeling kindred spirits with their situations. In the end, both characters come to terms with their situations in their own different ways and they become better people as a result.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, the series is a beautiful one to see with gorgeous scenic shots and fluid movement from characters. Characters and scenery are given a lifelike feel with a good amount of visual detail and realistic features applied to the designs of characters. The soundtrack consists of a mix of light and dramatic insert tracks that fit the mundane feel of After the Rain and blend in nicely with the anime's various scenes. In particular with the music, \"Ref: Rain\" made for a fitting ED song for the series with its melancholic mood and lyrics being a perfect fit for After the Rain's drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, After the Rain is easily among my personal favorite titles for 2018 thus far. Being seemingly focused on an age-gap relationship that it sensibly handles, the series instead focuses on the struggles that Akira and Kondo experience with their personal interests and the show explores how both handle these and the relationship they develop with one another. This is a definite recommendation if you are looking for something different for a romance anime.",

            "content": "Love is pure bliss, a relationship between a man and a woman, and unrequited love till noticed...until something like an age gap comes and puts people in question.\r\nThat's Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After The Rain) for you, a romance series that tells the story of Akira Tachibana, a high school (former) track and field team player armed with an injury, that settles her for a part-time job (as getaway means) at a cafe, and meeting the 45-year old restaurant manager Masami Kondou, with love feelings in the air.\r\nComing from the manga series of the same name, the topic of age gap in romanceseries is rarely ever touched upon, though ever mentioned in anime adaptations once in a while, especially when it comes to romance, an easy but inexplicably misunderstood term and adverse results that come from it. From the small settings right from the start, the relationship between Akira and Kondou were slim as people opposed to Akira's feelings in the storm of rain towards the unsuspecting Kondou, but as time passes on, it felt more of the same feeling of a love journey that explains through and through about how and why our MCs are that way.\\n\\n\r\nGoing on with the characters, it really played its ball park well here, and is what this show deserved in order for the story to remain relevant.\\n\r\nAkira Tachibana may seem like the stereotypical high school girl with dreams and ambitions, but the feeling of love is something that she cannot get her feet across, even and after the encounter with Kondou, realizing that this love of hers have to be taken one small leap at a time.\\n\\n\r\nAkira's friend, Haruka Kyan, really was the friend that stood with her during her track and field days, and even with Akira's injury causing her to fall out from the team, she still kept in contact with Akira and even after endlessly knowing that her best friend has a crush on someone that's a generation (or 10+ years older), like Akira, she couldn't understand what it meant to be in love, but what she does know is to keep Akira in check most of the time, and it did what her characterization did from the outset.\\n\\n\r\nI'd appreciate Masami Kondou, knowing his love for literature back in his school days with the aforementioned famed novelist Chihiro Kujou, which so happens that both characters are schoolmates in high school, and had dreams of becoming novelists to write stories unto the world. And thankfully, he acts like how a 45-year old man should be, and let's be honest here, his character development is one that I truly can relate to, being an adult and finding the balance in life through work, family and interests.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other caf\u00e9 staff are filled as filler for the show's MCs, but their jobs are something to note of as they carry and toss around with the MCs relations towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation really doesn't sweat a beat, looks gorgeous and beautiful, and I'm honestly lost for words. Wit Studio, after coming out of Mahoutsukai no Yome, has done so much for this romance series (through they mostly did action fantasy stories) and it really doesn't let out any bit of cheapness here, everything is tied into perfection and the reflection of the illustrations sums up how much I enjoyed the art scenery surrounding the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also top-notch, when you see music artists like HoneyWorks and Aimer, they truly pack a punch when it comes to the OST's OP and ED respectively. The light sense of enjoyment lifted by the rain in the OP and the afterthoughts of Ref:rain (more like Refrain), passing clouds of rain in the ED, what an awesome and worthy soundtrack. The same BGM plays through important moments, and it does tie into the storyline very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (After The Rain) comes recommended if you don't mind the romance that's slightly differed than the norm, armed with beautiful sightseeing and a worthy OST, coupled with the great storytelling and all. Wit Studio definitely gets props for handling this so well. Even after the romance age-gap issue does affect you, I'd also advise you to try this anime out, it's really something else.",

            "content": "The one thing that made me watch this particular show in the first place was the animation studio. I have a real soft spot for WIT Studio, but then the beautiful calm slice of life story peppered with romance drew me in. This is not some unrealistic love/romance story where two characters fall in love hook line and sinker. There is no kissing,  no even hand-holding or anything really. The show is, in fact, more about the development of a relationship, which is closer to a friendship between two lonely people.  It is filled with embarrassment, awkward moments and pauses and misunderstandings andis all the more endearing because relateable. Both main characters are basically in the middle of a crisis. Akira used to love to run. Running was everything to her and her biggest joy but since her injury, she cannot run anymore and started working instead at a Caf\u00e9. Her boss and love interest Kondo is divorced and has low self-esteem. Most of his employees do not take him serious but for some reason, Akira is drawn to him. During the story, we discover more and more about him and Kondo is definitely a lot more interesting than originally shown. This anime is a slow-burner and I love it for it. If you liked \"Garden of Words\" and have a thing for \"Slice of Life\" stories with a dash of romance then you should definitely try this show. The art isn't quite as flashy as in other WIT Studio productions but still gorgeous and I love the music.",

            "content": "TL;DR: Do you want a semi- romantic story that involves age gaps but doesn't involve any sex or any kind of abuse? Then this show just might be for you. This show is cute, charming and really showcases the beauty of friendship and understanding. I highly recommend it to anyone honestly.\r\nNow first off let me be clear by saying that just because I personally gave this anime a ten, that doesn't mean I think it's perfect or that every single person has to like it. Part of it is obviously personal but I mean that's to be expected I believe.\r\nMoving on, let me start bysaying that it deeply saddens me that some look at this show at a first glace assume it's just some weird fetish filled mess that has pedophilia involved. When it couldn't be further from the truth. \\n\r\nIt's sad that there's real, legitimate cases of gross or sexually harmful anime that go unchecked simply because they're so taboo that they sorta go unnoticed by the average viewer, but I saw some ignorant people blatantly going after this show. \\n\r\nI don't like using the word ignorant, but in this case there we're a decent amount of people who just saw this and judged it without even bothering to do research it seems.\\n\\n\r\nI'm someone who like's age gaps in stories, when done properly I think they can be very interesting stories and show how anyone can care for someone regardless of age (I'm speaking of adults however, not involving kids. That's a whole different story) so of course when I saw this I was excited.\\n\r\nHOWEVER. Since sadly age gaps in stories tend to be harmful, abusive or portrayed as a fetish. I did my research on this before going in.\\n\r\nThankfully, this is adapted form a manga, so it was fairly easy to research and find out that the story is actually very positive and sweet.\\n\r\nAfter finding that out, I definitely wasn't disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nBe prepared however that this is not an action or even drama packed story. And that's what I liked about it.\\n\r\nNormally with stuff involving age gaps, there always has to be some added drama or some kind of negative overtone. And sure there were obviously times where in the show the age gap had to be addressed by the characters, but it was never really done in some overly negative way.\\n\\n\r\nIn simple terms, this show is about a seventeen year old girl recovering from an injury, during that time she met an older man who captivated her and the show is basically about her adventures in loving him and working alongside him at the same cafe she met him in. There's some drama along the way, along with new discoveries and the difficulties she has with her best friend at school.\\n\r\nBut without giving spoilers I'd say this show is more about friendship and just generally loving someone more than romantic love.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly feel like this is a show everyone should see at least once in their life. It really showed me the importance of the small events in our lives, and how love and feelings of love can come up at anytime, and even if they don't go anywhere, those feelings affect us and help us through parts of our lives.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is just such a feel good show for me. And hey it might not be for everyone, and that's fine. But if you have any interest at all I highly recommend at least trying it out.\\n\r\nAnd honestly, I wish I could have wrote this without addressing the negativity surrounding the basic idea of the show, but hey it's kinda hard to when a lot of people associate age gaps instantly with pedophilia or a fetish, which just isn't always the case. And I would LOVE to see more shows like this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I totally realize that this show received a lot of praise as well, which is awesome. I just wanted to address the negative aspect for the sake of a reader who might be one of those people who's worrying the show is what some people thought.",

            "content": "At first, when this anime was announced, I was like \"meh, that's gonna be a stupid story\", and I don't even know why I thought like that. Then, when the first episode came out, I didn't even bother to finish watching it, because the art style of the characters didn't really catch my eye.\r\nBUT\r\nOh man, do I regret everything I've mentioned above, HELL YES, I DO. Just finished watching all the released episodes in one-breath, I'd say.\r\nFirst of all, I'd like to point out the story of this series. This anime isn't your typical school-romance shoujo fluff stuff (idk why i wrote such a longdescr. lol). It's really weird to watch, tbh, but it's satisfying A F, because the way that whole story flows is just amazing, well, at least for me. You get a little bit of drama, a bit of comedy, a bit of fluff, a bit of romance, a bit of everything that will make your watching process soothing, relaxed and enjoyable! \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, I'd also like to outline the characters.\\n\r\nThe main character: Not my THE most favorite female character ever, but I surely do like her. I especially love how brave she is, I didn't expect her to be so stubborn as well lol that really adds some spice, I'd say, to her personality. Also, somehow reminds me of Chiyuki, from Death Parade. Idk if it's because of looks or kinda similar past, but, oh well, I loved Chiyuki and I like Akira as well!\\n\r\nNow, moving on to my THEEEEE most favorite character of the show, Kondou! Oh boy, I'm in love with this man with the very first seconds of his appearance in the episode (no wonder, why Akira fell for him lmao). He's so funny and nice and kind and adorable I cant with him. Such a supportive and nice boss, wish every adult was like him lol He really stands out for me the most in this series. \\n\r\n//KINDA SPOILER BELOW, SORRY// \\n\\n\r\nThe way he accepted everything and how nice he still approaches Akira, really touched dem heartstrings of mine.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in addition, Ryousuke gfys pls \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I really recommend you to watch this series, if you want to have a chill, relaxed and fluffy evening with a cup of hot chocolate :< I'll be totally waiting for the next episodes to be aired. \\n",

            "content": "(Spoiler is in the second paragraph)\r\nIn my opinion, I think that Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is an anime that should be more popular in the romance genre. As a person who regularly watches romance genre, they always mention the popular ones such as Your Lie in April, Golden Time, etc. However,I feel as if this one goes under the radar since I feel as if its score is misleading. \r\nThe reason why I feel the score is misleading is because people were sad about what happened to the two main characters. They didn't get together. \"Why? Why didn't they get together? Dang it!\"I was like this at first when I had watched the anime. However, if you look past the fact that the two MC's didn't get together, you will start to see that there is a deep development for all of the characters in the anime. The characters, the plot, setting, everything is so developed to the point where you can start to understand why certain scenes take place. This is something that shocked me.\\n\\n\r\nFeelings play a very important role in this anime and it can perhaps deal with issues. This anime portrays a very radical idea; the fact that a high school girl is completely head over heels with a man that is a lot older than him. This can make people go away from the anime, but it is original. To my knowledge, the only title that I can relate this to Kotonoha no Niwa and that is only 1 episode. This anime is a whole coaster full of emotions and each episode takes you down a cool ride. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8)\\n\r\nI thought that the story was very original as I said but I felt as if there wasn't enough execution. The lack of execution may just be because there is so much potential that I didn't want it to end, but I felt as if there was a missing aspect that was yet to be filled. Perhaps what happened after the ending? Either way, the story was pretty good but was lacking in execution; hence the 8\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8)\\n\r\nI feel as if the art and sound go hand in hand. There is nothing wrong with the art or sound; not that I noticed anyways. It isn't something that is like \"WOW THAT'S AMAZING\" but rather its like \"Ok\ud83d\udc4c, this sounds pretty cool and the art style is unique + pretty.\" \\n\\n\r\nCharacter and Enjoyment (9)\\n\r\nThis is probably why most people rated it so low. Once again, the ending really drove people away from the anime giving it its harsh score. Please try and look past it and see the development of the characters... it is truly something amazing that in my opinion, it rivals that of popular high-score anime's. I personally enjoyed the coaster of emotions and I found it really unique. I happened to binge this all in 4 days since I really enjoyed the unique concepts and ideas. I am sure the manga is just as great as the anime (as a person who doesn't read manga)\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Conclusion (9)\\n\r\nTo anyone that is reading this, please give this anime a try. I feel as if there needs to be more people watching these unique concepts so that more of them can be created. Instead of the overused high school romance anime, this is an anime that gave a really unique twist to the romance genre. This anime is a watch for anyone that is even considering to watch it.  \\n",

            "content": "(Resubmitted due to errors from previous entry)\r\nInstead of your typical romance series, this story takes up on a little twist where a 17 year old high school girl falls head over heels for her 45 year old manager of her part-time job. I must say...this series is such a brilliant reprieve from your usual generic love stories, and it doesn't try forcing stuff, either. I will try to be a bit brief with the details while explaining the best I can.\r\nSTORY: An unfortunate accident for our main heroine turns out as a new opportunity in the most unlikely of situations. The story really shines dueto the way of how unique and complex it really is. Granted, this kind of twist to the series may not seem enticing for many people, but it's nonetheless a good one. The fact that our Akira has to overcome past broken relationships and make new ones is quite the journey in itself in addition to the growing relationship between her and the manager. As for the manager himself, Mr. Kondou, it's nice that the experiences he has had with Akira do remind him of his own youthful past, as he contemplates whether or not this odd situation would work out or not. The support characters are also well drawn out, imo, to where they're not always just simple bystanders; granted, some may try to help or hinder the two main characters' growing and developing relationship through the series. The real conflict here is simply this: WILL this relationship work out or not? Either way, this series will have you rooting for the two to be together. Another note: the usage of symbolism and metaphors in the series is also quite amazing, if one gives attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nART: I must say that the animation style of this series is quite pretty while not trying to be super-duper fancy; it also can remind one of the classic anime style, giving that great nostalgic feeling that true anime fans can appreciate and be grateful for. In particular, the style depicts the character's eyes and facial expressions VERY well, especially that of Akira.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The soundtracks are the kind that can soothe the soul with their heartwarming or lighthearted tones; it's also reminiscent of the soundtracks of past series of the similar or same genre. It's arguably among the best anime music so far this season, barring that from the likes of Violet Evergarden. Funny enough, it really doesn't try to do anything particularly special, but that's fine for me, at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The backstories they gave the two main characters do very well in explaining and displaying how they got to where they are, especially Akira's. While Akira is usually now very shy, her smile is something to behold, and something that viewers can rave about. It is so heartwarming and amusing to see the likes of her falling madly in love with Mr. Kondou.\\n\r\nFor Masami Kondou himself, he's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, despite being socially awkward and honest most of the time. He also has a son from a past wife, and has had to work things out as a single parent all this time. It's really nice when certain experiences involving Akira remind him of his own youthful past...it can really get us viewers hoping and praying that this unlikely relationship will work out in the end. He's not a simple old man, either...his personality is quite colorful and definitely a salvation from the usual generic young male persona.\\n\r\nAs for the support characters, while they don't exactly stand out, they seem to be handled fairly well. Additionally, a handful of them are involved in the two main characters' relationship, whether to help or hinder them. It creates quite the emotional roller coaster, and makes the series more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Honestly, I did not know what to think when I was convinced to dive into this series. But right now, I love this series a lot for the uniqueness of the love story. I mean, cmon...a 17 year old girl with a 45 year old geezer? You don't see that kind of stuff every day!\\n\r\nGranted, while the manga plays out quite differently, I dare say that the anime probably did it a bit better...and that's not me being biased, either. For example, they showed more details into Kondou's personality, making him a more likable character, for the most part. Never at one point while I watch the series that I ever felt a slight bit bored...and it's funny cause I'm usually the guy who really likes all the action and edginess in anime series as well.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Two Words:\\n\r\nWATCH IT\\n\r\nWhile it may not be everyone's piece of pie, it's a dessert you won't regret. The uniqueness of the story as well as the colorfulness of the animation and the soundtracks should be good enough to keep you interested. Even if you're not a fan of romance series, you'll most likely still end up loving this series in particular.\\n\r\nI now rest my case and wish you may enjoy the show!",

In fact, the romance was a trigger to lead into something else. What is that something? well, let's just say it you can relate it with real life. I won't mention it in here so you'll have to watch it to find out.\r\nOne of the good things in this story is that there are lots of interesting and funny moments, but even so you'll find meaningful words thorough the entire episode, which gave me a good watching experience.\r\nAnother aspect that might be a good thing israther than focusing only on the main story, there are some side stories that actually became a strong background for the whole story. This might be a simple thing but in my opinion is something that anime these days lacks. However, this is actually a double edged sword since it might looked like they just add some side stories and don't really focus on the original plot, making people think that it's just a mediocre story.\\n\r\nAnother flaw in this anime would be the character developments. Excluding the characters who are related to the side stories that I mention, other character have little to none developments even though being really near to the main characters. If I may point a big flaw, it would be the one in episode 4 and episode 8 (I won't mention any spoilers here).\\n\r\nOverall, the anime itself does have its own strength, however the execution of the story might have been a flaw. Nevertheless, I still believe that the hidden meaning of the story is what made me give a 9 for it.",

At the same time we are shown that she is a lonely girl especially after the ankle injury, she misses the athletic club and since then she does not socialize much with her old friends, she is also shown to be something mature in comparison to her schoolmates and she prefers to be alone.\\n\r\nManager Kondou i loved him from the first minutes of the first chapter, is cheerful, fun, intelligent and good boss, although somewhat clumsy (I would like to have a boss like him) unfortunately many of his employees do not have the respect he deserves and even speak evil of him behind his back, which I can not understand since the guy is super great to my taste and I think that Tachibana saw that jaja.\\n\\n\r\nKondou is a responsible guy who has been divorced, often Tachibana reminds him of his youth and does not know how to express the feelings that he has made him feel or how to take his confession, he knows that it is not possible and because of that he usually tries to distance Tachibana, he has a son, so he can often look more like a father to her.\\n\r\nFor the rest of the characters I do not feel that there is anything to highlight so much, no doubt the friend of Tachibana (Haruka) played a very important role to better understand Tachibana, she came to feel forgotten and that the friendship she had with Tachibana is gone breaking from when I leave the athletics club, which she does not want and always try to maintain those bonds of friendship, Kondou also has a friend who likewise distanced themselves and the contrast between the two protagonists is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a good series, perhaps in the last chapters lost a bit the level that had personally reached in its first 6/7 chapters, but it is still recommended and one of the best of this season and highly recommended if you like these types of animes 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------Espa\u00f1ol/Spanish--------------------------------------------\\n\r\n\u201cAhora en este momento...

Al mismo tiempo se nos muestra que es una chica solitaria sobre todo luego de la lesi\u00f3n en el tobillo, ella extra\u00f1a el club de atletismo y desde entonces ya no socializa mucho con sus viejas amigas, se nos muestra tambi\u00e9n que es algo madura en comparaci\u00f3n a sus compa\u00f1eros de escuela y prefiere estar sola.\\n\r\nEl gerente Kondou me encanto desde los primeros minutos del primer cap\u00edtulo, es alegre, divertido, inteligente y buen jefe, aunque algo torpe (quisiera tener un jefe como el) lastimosamente muchos de sus empleados no le tienen el respeto que se merece y hasta hablan mal de el a sus espaldas, cosa que no puedo comprender ya que el tipo es super genial a mi gusto y creo que Tachibana vio eso jaja.\\n\r\nKondou es un tipo responsable el cual se ha divorciado, a menudo Tachibana le recuerda su juventud y no sabe como expresarle los sentimientos que le ha hecho sentir o como tomar su confesi\u00f3n, el sabe que no es posible y debido a eso suele intentar alejar a Tachibana, el posee un hijo, as\u00ed que a menudo puede verse mas como un padre para ella.\\n\r\nPara el resto de personajes no siento que exista algo que destacar tanto, sin duda la amiga de Tachibana (Haruka) jugo un papel muy importante para entender mejor a Tachibana, ella llego a sentirse olvidada y que la amistad que tenia con Tachibana se ha ido rompiendo desde que dejo el club de atletismo, cosa que ella no quiere e intenta mantener siempre esos lazos de amistad, Kondou tambi\u00e9n posee un amigo que de igual manera se distanciaron y es interesante el contraste que poseen en esto los dos protagonistas.\\n\\n\r\nEn general: Es una buena serie, quiz\u00e1s en los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos perdi\u00f3 un poco el nivel que personalmente hab\u00eda alcanzado en sus primeros 6/7 cap\u00edtulos, pero aun as\u00ed es recomendable y una de las mejores de esta temporada y altamente recomendada si te gustan estos tipos de animes 8/10.",

            "content": "Love is something that is so abstract, that anyone would interpret it differently to one another. Anyone can love anybody and in my opinion there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. A certain anime caught my eye last season with a story of a blooming love of an innocent teenager for her manager at her workplace who doubles her age, hinting to anybody who watch this anime that there is no boundary for love and sometimes love could lead us to self discoveries and resolutions. This is an adaptation of manga created by Jun Mayuzuki, this is Koi wa Ameagari no You Ni or After the Rain.\r\nTheone that is really outstanding in this anime is of course its story and characters. While the story is centered on romance that blooming between a teenage girl and her manager, the story itself is never too focused on that, letting the back stories, side stories, and character developments grow the romance between the two so the story felt more natural as every resolution of a problem and character development will affect the relation between the two. I love this kind of story, the kind that slowly builds for the final, not rushing to the end and spend more time to have the characters developed themselves.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that the opening and ending song of this anime really good. The ending song itself have stayed in my playlist for months. That song, Ref:rain by Aimer, is so much perfect to be played in this rainy season while having the rain fell on your body and wetted your clothes. While the ending felt much more melancholy, the opening felt much like a bright sun after the rain, bringing some happiness to start the anime. Having those two elements in the anime is really good and made me stay for much longer.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style while not so upstanding, they have rated as acceptable for a romance anime. Romance or drama did not need an intense animation like action genre do but they need to do the perfect timing to show off their capabilities in animation and the studio did pull this off perfectly every time the girl went bubbly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I could dub this anime into one of the anime of the season alongside Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho. The major flaw of this anime maybe not anyone could enjoy this anime. While I was enjoying this anime so much, I would not reccomend this anime to anyone who bothered with this kind of love. The one that involved a young woman with a man doubles her age. You need to have a mind set that anyone could love anybody before you could start to watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Why should you watch Koi wa Ameagari no You ni?\r\nStory is Outstanding (10). This anime is one of the biggest surprises for me in the winter season. I usually avoid romance stories as they are most of the time predictable and difficult for me to relate to as most of the stories are set on a high school setting with a ton of high school characters. But here comes a seinen romance that caught my heart as soon as I watched the first episode. The setting was great and the use of rain in the story feels right at home. The love that builds upwith the 45-year-old Kondo and the high school student Tachibana is simply beautiful and innocent. Someone who had a lot of experience and someone who is dead sure of her feelings hits a sweet spot in my heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt is Great (9). I would say that the art would be dependent on the viewer's taste. Well it's not experimental, but I feel that some people would not like the art and would prefer a mainstream look of modern anime. However, I love how the characters were modeled to look as slender as possible. Moreover, they put a lot of  attention on the rain scenes since this is mainly in the title of the story. It is not Kotonoha no niwa (Garden of words) quality but it is enough to trigger those emotions from the viewer which is enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound is Outstanding (10). From the opening them up until the ending theme and everything in between, the music of Love after the rain is light, fun, bubbly and somewhat nostalgic of from when it rains during summer time. \"Nostalgic Rainfall (\u30ce\u30b9\u30bf\u30eb\u30b8\u30c3\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb)\" by CHiCO with HoneyWorks is one of those songs that I have on a loop majority of the winter season, and I listen to \"Ref:rain\" by Aimer from time to time as it triggers the nostalgic sadness in my heart whenever I hear its tune. Moreover, the themes and effects during the Kondo-Tachibana and the solo scenes themes of Kondo, Tachibana and Haruka really sets the mood and helps to make you feel on their characters more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are Outstanding (10). The main character's motivation as well as their personality are well written and designed that you will feel they could have been based from real people which is great. You can easily relate to the like on the struggling writer inside Manager Kondo, the conflicting feelings of going back to running in Tachibana and the loneliness of her friend Haruka. The same goes for the supporting characters that supports the main characters while bringing out their own wonderful quirks in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs of the writing of this review, the manga had already ended and this a great thing since the anime staff would have a complete material to adapt once the continue with a second and third season to wrap their stories up. \\n\\n\r\nI am really looking forward to this story, and you will also be looking forward to it once you have watch this rain formed love story.\\n\\n\r\n9 milk cuplets out of 10.",

            "content": "Love can be as strange as it can be...........and it's true, and this anime has delivered it with flying colors. so\"\r\nVery Good 8, Story:\r\nIt was well executed, the plot did deliver as to what the title says. Ok, so the story about a girl falling for an older guy was something, in fact it was unique, cu'z in most cases it was them older men who would go after the younger ones, just as Pres Trump does with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal ( You guys do know about this issue, do you?), but here, it was more like a young girl who goes afteran older man, who can qualify as her daddy, but what's very good about it was that the older man has the integrity to decline and he does it in a nice and indirect way that it doesn't make us audience hate him......of course you may have already read the spoiler from the manga that was posted by Hibikase in this anime's form site as to how it ended. The plot also give us audience a life lesson about pursuing one's dream that it was never too late as long as you're alive, and that's how the cookie crumbles , when it crumbles this good.\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art: \\n\\n\r\nWell it still does have that eye-candy school uniform thing in it, and seeing Akira in sexy shorts it all the service you're gonna see, no shower , onsen, swimsuit nor panty service to see around here. \\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Sound:\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes an anime like this soooo good was the opening cu'z it did match perfectly with the anime's plot and so as the ending theme, Voices of the characters did match very good as well, Akira having a voice that fits her personality, Kondo whose voice was this cautious gentleman who it kind and considerate, and so as everyone else whose voices match perfectly as to their personalities, like Nishida who has a naive and shy voice and let's not forget the obachan 2nd in command of the restaurant Kubo whose the big woman around and should be promoted if Kondo did resign.  \\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Character:\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this was all about Akira and Kondo, but there were some instances that the two could be gay ( jaz my opinion) cu'z we see some uncommon closeness that one exist between Akira and her friend Haruka, Kondo and his  former college classmate Chihiro. But hey,that's just me, but then again I can't stop thinking about it........Ok so Akira being this girl whose dream of being a track and field star was shattered by an injury and Kondo who stopped writing cu'z he all of the sudden has a family , well in my opinion was just too shallow to begin with.  Kondo, seemly is having success in being a restaurant manager should have just given up already and just find new love after his divorce.....but not with Akira since that would prove to be too risky for his career , and Akira with just a simple injury were she only need to rest and recover could anytime go back to track and field. Now for Haruka, Akira bestie, to me I find her as this lesbian who would try one way or another to get her back to the sport , I did mention lesbian, since the way they hold hands was something that lovers would do. As for Kondo's friend Chihiro, man, his name sounded too feminine , his hair style was too feminine and the way he approaches Kondo was that of a closet gay try to be manly in-front of his man crush whom doesn't know that he's gay, EEEEEEEWWWWW. Though the role of the two did played well, it was the possibility of the gay thing that makes me think twice of giving this category an 8, so a 7 will do, since there is this romance that didn't materialize in a GOOD way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy watching this since this is one anime that sparks such curiosity as to how will the two end, though, it didn't ended the way I expect, it was a Very Good ending.\\n\\n\r\nGreat 9, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nThere are no worlds other that the rating to describe this anime, so kudos to the original creator Mayuzuki Jun and studio Wit Studio for picking the right manga to have an anime adaptation, a season 2 would not be advisable since it will only ruin as to how the manga and anime has to end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe End.......",

            "content": "Proofread and has no spoilers. I will give a review of both the first and second half because both are vastly different in quality.\r\nAs someone who partially read the manga and finished the anime, I just want to say that in my defense, The series has 12 episodes and I loved the first 6 but it lost its charm during the second half (episode 10 is the only good episode in the second half) \r\nAnyway, I will try to keep this short.\r\n7 for story\r\nThis is not really a spoiler, it is just how you view this anime, this is a romance plus achieving goals/ ambitionstype of story, and it did it really well with great story telling and narrative. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, why did I give it a 7 and not higher, some character interactions are pretty weak and drags on for a while and some unnecessary drama with sub characters getting a pretty okay character development. \\n\\n\r\n10 for Art\\n\\n\r\nCome on, it's WIT. The background and animation is fluid and works well with good directing to make the scenery look outstanding. \\n\\n\r\n9 for sound\\n\r\nIntro and Ending are catchy and memorable and iconic.\\n\r\nBackground music or OST gets annoying after a while on repeat. \\n\\n\r\n6 for character \\n\\n\r\nOther than Yuuta and the blonde chick at the restaurant and the managers friend from University,  all other side characters are pretty dull and annoying and sometimes doing actions that are out of their characters like Drama Queen Haruka. \\n\r\nSide characters keep getting introduced and never mentioned again countless times. Akira friends show up so often and never did we get to learn their names or if Akira likes them or not. We have no clue, it isn't Detective Conan for crying out loud. \\n\r\nWeakest aspect in my opinion with unknown side character resolves, only the main characters get some development.\\n\r\nI do not even know if Akira's dad is alive or not.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I will give it a 7 overall. First half gets a 9 and second half gets a 5.\\n\\n\r\nWith these flaws mostly noticeable during the second half, it made me cringe so many times and I ended up forcing myself. For the first half, time went by so fast and I absolutely loved it. As if they were two separate stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I will give it a 7\\n\\n\r\nIt is not bad in the end, the ending is pretty good and it feels rushed at times but the atmosphere and the story and the sound plus outstanding WIT art style made the anime enjoyable, even if the story and characters might fall flat at times, it was a enjoyable watch. Re watchable, I don't think so, probably I will watch this again up till episode 6 and end it there.  \\n\\n",

The dark clouds, the gloom weather, all of them brought true feelings in order to reach the viewer's heart and then there was always sunshine after the rain, which is something that i really love to see.\r\nFor the music, the OP and ED are just top-notchand the crews really know what they're doing. \\n\r\nSummarily\\n\r\nStory-8 | Art-9 | Music-10 | Entertaining-10\\n\r\nI recommend you guys to enjoy this show",

What started off seeming like a perverted \"Old guy get with young girl\" fantasy actually turned into a charming tale of friendship and life after having your dreams completely broken.  \r\nI was initially drawn in by the art.  That honestly kept me going through each episode even though I kept fearing that there was going to be some upcoming perverted scene.  There is nothing like listening the sound of cicadas while watching beautifully animated cherry trees blossom.  Those moments always bring in some kind of nostalgiaof a life only lived through anime.  The animation of Koi wa Ameagari no You ni really made me wish for rainy days.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a cute slice of life anime to pass the time, Koi wa Ameagari no You ni will keep you entertained enough.",

There was less emphasis on the romance and more on self-reflection and how to navigate through life.\r\nI absolutely loved the anime and started looking forward to it every Monday after finishing my classes at uni. The character development, artwork, and music were all splendid. I never thought that I could deeply bond with a 45-year-old restaurant manager but Kondou-san's life reallymoved me. His life struggles, divorce, long-lost love and ambition for literature, and managing life/career, in general, is something that we all can relate to in one way or another. The overall emphasis of the anime was choosing how to live our lives by doing what we love and being true to ourselves. So, lots of emphasis on self-love. I am definitely going to catch up with the manga to see how the story unfolds and in the meantime, I hope there will be a season 2!",

            "content": "Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is one of the most unexpected and interesting romance but an even more interesting story of self-identity, failure and future expectations.\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni will probably deter MANY viewers due to the premise alone, of Akira Tachibana voiced by Sayumi Watabe a 17 year old high school student wanting to be in a relationship with her 45 year old MUCH older manager Masami Kondou voiced by Hiroaki Hirata but Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is definitely \"different\" in how it deals with this relationship.\r\nNow Akira and Kondou's \"relationship\" has some obstacles here and there, like theblackmailing womanizer Ryousuke Kase voiced by Tomoaki Maeno and Haruka Kyan voiced by Emi Miyajima but for the most part, the obstacles shown aren't exactly deterrents in their unique relationship Akira and Kondou had built up as they never effectively try to break this relationship in the first place, mostly because of other grievances the character in question has to Akira (mostly), Haruka is the closest in breaking up their relationship if only because she's the only one that tries to question the legitimacy of their relationship. The \"relationship\" and the fundamental existence of their relationship is at the core of the anime thus spends ALOT of screentime on their relationship as well as Akira and Kondou themselves.\\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni's themes of self identity, failure and future expectations are very much linked to Akira and Kondou's relationship, self identity through if their relationship is even worth it (let alone social ethnics getting in the way) and their regrets spawned from their failures only fuel the relationship further and the future expectations of if their relationship works or fails, what next if it \"works out then what?\" or \"will they go back to their regrets and bypass it or linger in it forever\". Akira as a teenager hasn't been through too much failure besides her track and field and has more time to think things out BUT Kondou has gone through several failures and knows about regret and his future is almost set in stone. Akira and Kondou's relationship for LA is the manifestation and symbolism of self identity and it's crises of failure all put into one. If your looking at a surface level it's weird...but LA thinks Koi wa Ameagari no You ni kinda wants you to be a bit more introspective than \"it's weird\".\\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni by all regards is a bit of a character study on Akira, Kondou as well as their \"relationship\" to put into question as well. Akira herself holds some regret about her leaving the track and field and became a loner but her clinging and holding some relatability towards Kondou while trying to also know him might be taken as Akira's delusional aspects coming in which puts even Akira and Kondou's relationship into question. Kondou aforementioned also holds some regret but not in track and field but him as a teenager wanting to be a novelist but having a family and then divorced crushed that dream he had and now works as a manager in a family restaurant. Both Akira and Kondou finds solace in their regrets but again this calls into question if they are just using each other as emotional leverage in their lives or if they genuinely love each other OR if their emotional leverage might make their relationship actually work. This is probably the main reason why this relationship is interesting if not unique already due to it's premise it set up.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Wit Studio is a rather unique much like the core of the anime itself. LA doesn't know it feels like SHAFT's animation but retrained a bit and given the shoujo atmosphere to it, it's bubbly, shiny and mostly drearily with the obvious themes of using rain but also with some interesting base character designs (almost like a CLAMP character designer had a hand in the process, long neck, long faces, different costumes & hairstyles per episode etc). LA felt the animation was also exotically different of the Winter of 2018 from the character designs, atmosphere and overall look to it. Wit Studios doing a romance?...and doing the animation justice?...that's a first! (Note: LA hasn't watched Ancient Magus Bride at the time of this review soooo...)\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, well LA hasn't heard about most of these voice actors most notably Sayumi Watabe who's only done 3 roles at this point (this one included), Emi Miyajima and Haruka Fukuhara. LA will have to say that Haruka Fukuhara was quite interesting as Yui Nishida, Akira's friend at her job, 100% genki and high toned to a fault and moe as hell. LA did feel that Emi Miyajima tackled down her dramatic chops and shown it pretty well and as for Sayumi herself, she did the aloof kuudere personality with 100% commitment. As for Hiroaki Hirata, he did pretty well in Koi wa Ameagari no You ni with his various vocals and cadence though mostly aloof. The other genki of the group would be Junya Ikeda who voiced Takashi Yoshizawa, Akira's love interest (but buttmonkey friend soooo you know where THAT'S going, still good comedic character though). VERY interesting voice cast if anything and only adds to the interesting elements of Koi wa Ameagari no You ni as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ameagari no You ni is by far one of the most unique romances to come out of Winter of 2018, weird premise alone may take some people out of this anime if only looking at it on a surface level, but Koi wa Ameagari no You ni is something more than weird relationship, it's an introspective look at the regrets of lives living in failure and finding comfort in that with the social ethnics to this relationship being called into question aside, Koi wa Ameagari no You ni's philosophical take on failure and depression and takes light of it in an optimistic nature at the worst of times, but \"comforting\" at the best of times. \\n\\n\r\nLA might sound sadistic but Koi wa Ameagari no You ni might have given \"misery loves company\" an optimistic edge to it.",

How best to review this particular anime? \r\nLet me start off by saying that if you've clicked on this anime then you must love slice of life anime and/or romance. \r\nThis anime bears, for me at least, a striking resemblance to one of my favourite anime movies: The Garden of Words.\r\nThis holds true for this anime right down to the obsession with rain. Don't mistake my tone for one of boredom though. This is a great anime with decent characters and a great plot bunny. \r\nI must also say that the female lead has one of the most intense and mesmerizing eyes I've everseen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend it if you love a little love. \\n\\n\r\nThe series ended on an ending that while not what I hoped for was still as satisfying. All in all if you love romance and/or slice of life then this is an anime worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nAmeagari is, in my opinion the best slice of life anime of its season. \\n\\n\r\nAs you guys know though, this is just my personal view on the matter. I've always loved anime that break the mould and/or tackle subject matter most wouldn't explore.",

It's not some fantastical amazing unique plot.  I would even say the plot is mundane, but it is sweet, and the efforts the animators put into the art and music truly imbue a certain magic in the appeal of each episode.  There is nothing perverted, demented, or vulgar.  It's the adorable story of a teenage girl who whimsically falls in love with a pushover adult man and it does a good job of displaying his circumstances and personal feelings.  You get a more completepicture of the couple as their struggles aren't simply comedic misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't realistic, as it is anime.  We don't watch anime for the realistic scenarios.  This isn't some blockbuster 10/10 anime, as that isn't really this genre's style.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I guarantee this is sweet, enjoyable, and a good change of pace.

Main female protagonist, Akira Tachibana, probably has daddy fetish and falls in love with men who could be her father. Okay I'm joking with the first part but the fact is that her crush is 45-year-old men, Masami Kondou, who is her boss.\r\n BUT it's not like that you would imagine it: he hasn't got bad intentions and isas innocent as a lamb. He apologizes for everything to his customers in the restaurant and blushes when he gets embarrassed. Also, he is divorced and has got a son.\\n\\n\r\nTachibana seems as she thinks that all that lovey dovey shit sucks and is not interested in her classmates. We get to know that she is really good at running but she can't do that any longer( I won't tell you because I'm trying to write without any spoilers). One day she comes across Kondou and you can guess her feelings after reading words above.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 \\n\r\nTo be honest, the serie tries to be realistic but it's not and there is a lot of unnecessary drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI love the eyes of Tachibana that sparkle every time she thinks about her crush. Also, there are a lot of aesthetic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nMostly piano sounds but it's working well with the drama.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nI rated the character of Tachibana. She deals with some serious stuff and doesn't care what other people thinks. Also, she seems stiff but reveals her emotions when being with Kendou.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI can't hide the fact that I'm pleased with each episode and can't wait for the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (Remember that I'm only on the fourth episode guys)\\n\\n\r\nIt was my first review and I hope it won't be deleted :') hope you liked it.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the manga.\r\nYes, the underlying premise is sorta weird, but ultimately, the execution is what matters most.\r\nThe narrative took its time without being sluggish. Romantic tension faded into something more subtle but somehow more intimate. On Tachibana's part, explicit advances became well-informed gestures of encouragement. The manager, on the other hand, understood the awkward situation for what it was, and in my opinion, has handled things well. Kondou neither encouraged Tachibana nor did he outright reject her confession. A confession which, to my satisfaction, occurred early in the story. Another example of the new, more nuanced romance being produced in worldliterature.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the parallels between Tachibana and Kondou. They both found themselves estranged and distanced from what they loved to do, but slowly they were able to reconnect, with varying degrees of success. Tachibana and Haruka ran hot and cold (haha), unable to completely move beyond their issues but unwilling to give upon each other. In contrast, Kondou and Kujou were able to reforge their friendship, highlighting the discrepancy in maturity and life experience between them and the two teens. This can also be seen in the lag between Kondou's recommitment to writing and Tachibana's to running.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum, the anime thus far wasn't really about an old dude and a young woman. It was about two people coming to terms with where they're currently at in life, all wrapped up in a creative work that emphasized both youthful sensation (e.g. wind, rain, etc.) and internal monologue.\\n\\n\r\nI was reminded of how important the little moments are. Those moments when you're reminded of a time long gone, when you remember what you've forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this was a risky enterprise considering the current sociopolitical climate, but I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe you will be too.",

            "content": "There's a lot of praise that can be thrown around for a good concept. As much as we can say that books aren't judged by their covers, we know better. Everyone judges a book by its cover, because with so artistic visions out there, if we can't take a cover at face value, we'll never be able to follow any journey. The key behind the clich\u00e9 is that if we do judge a book based on its cover, we have to hope that it delivers on what is being sold, trusting that the text is wearing its heart literally on its sleeve.\r\nAnd that's unfortunately whatAfter the Rain was not able to do. Because while it is a fantastically beautiful character drama of two very confused, complicated souls, it does not truly follow-through on its broader ambition.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain's general premise is the sort of thing to raise eyebrows: a romance between a seventeen year old track star and a forty-five year old manager grinding his middle-adulthood working at a simple, no fluff restaurant. Two unique individuals who, under the circumstance of working at the same place, have sparks fly, have love bloom, and have a deepening bond together. The age factor is obviously the more controversial portion of this, and will certainly turn many off out-of-hand by the implications.\\n\\n\r\nBut if one is willing to suspend their disbelief for a moment around the concept, it is the lack of commitment toward that vision that would both keep those more prudish among us around to continue watching, and is likely also ultimately the downfall of After the Rain.\\n\\n\r\nThe big issue with After the Rain is that is fails to truly execute on its romantic narrative that is built up from the very beginning. The female lead Tachibana is stern, a little hard-headed, a little naive, and a lot of socially awkward. She very quickly realizes she has brooding feelings of romance for her manager, and seems so head-over-heels by the proposition that admitting her feelings to him seems like the most logical option. Kondou is more level-headed, having already had his time in the spotlight for teen romance, almost viewing his time as over, having passed long ago with his youth, yet with a vague, underlying notion that he deserves happiness even when he doubts he should attain it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this sounds like a fantastic premise for a romance, yes? Two people who want something, are horrible at acting on it, who will inevitably end up together. The issue here is that their romance is plodding, to say the least. The show emphasizes their growth as individuals, allowing their coy but ultimately platonic interactions to balance out their own personal woes. They each learn lessons, learn more about themselves in the process, and grow both closer to each other as well as closer to their own understanding of their ideals. But the speed at which this is executed is drastically slow. While the interactions feel legitimate and natural, you're essentially left on the edge of your seat the entire viewing internally screaming JUST KISS ALREADY. Will they or won't they? Will they get out of their ruts or won't they? It's an eternal question riding a wave through the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nWhich comes to where the show does excel, which is on its aspect of character drama. As the show continually institutes new characters, adding complexity to the narrative, different threads that will eventually be handled or otherwise strummed for emotional payoff, After the Rain spends its time analyzing the characters, their thoughts, their ambitions, and how they all interrelate. And it's quite skilled at this! After the Rain frequently takes a quieter approach to things, allowing scenes to play slowly and breathe, while also not going out of their way to bore you. Instead, small scenes of silence speak larger volumes. From simple shots of a pensive, love yearning, teenage girl gazing at the ceiling from bed, to more stupendous shots of sharing a literary quote while staring at the full moon, these scenes along with their gorgeous artwork highlight the subtle storytelling at play. Of particular note are the various dream-like sequences, which heighten emotional thoughts or climaxes with filters and sound-effects that give an emotional resonance, allowing the largely spoken-word screenplay to pull you around. As a character drama, After the Rain excels, with a fair if frequently somber and melodramatic emotional payoff by the end. But c'mon, if you're reading this far, you already know that this is a heightened melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nIt's when that character-analyzing melodrama ricochets over the more prominent romantic arc where things get tangled. After the Rain is inherently about Tachibana and Kondou, but because the show strings along the romantic aspect of the show, it ends up spending more time solving their personal problems without tying together their romantic disparities. It's the equivalent of going to see some shooting stars, but the sky is overcast; sure, maybe you can see glimpses through breaks in the clouds, but the payoff seems lackluster if your expectations were set on a more complete package.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can't be faulted is the artistry on display. The subtle yet lush animation delivered by Wit Studio is great, and a very big diversion from their typical Attack on Titan flair, leaning more in line with the quiet, almost magical prominence of something like Ancient Magus' Bride, with less of the overt fantasy overtones. The animation features straightforward but earnest visual metaphors to balance out the narrative itself, and harnesses some of the sleekiest animation in the industry for some really enthralling shots. Meanwhile, while the music is also enjoyable, its quite forgettable, beyond the stunning ED Re:frain by Aimer, which you would be a fool to skip at the end of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf we are to judge a book by its cover, then how would one judge After the Rain after experiencing what it has to offer? While the premise is intriguing, the follow-through can leave a lot to be desired. While there is fantastic drama and realism within After the Rain, there is a lack of romantic bonding and execution on some of the narrative's core themes. And while After the Rain is certainly not a bad viewing experience, it might leave those who have high expectations leaving ultimately disappointed, not because the experience itself is unenjoyable, but because the execution was not as enlivening as it could have been under different circumstances.",

            "content": "Coming into this, it was purely because of a YouTube recommendation. Myself, a highschool girl falling in love with someone 30 years older just isn't my thing. But I gave it a shock, and I was quite surprised. I wouldn't say I flat out enjoyed it either, making my feelings for this quite complex, and hence, writing this review.\r\nThe Good:\r\nWhat kept me watching Koi wa Ame was how beautiful it was. What it did faultlessly was set the mood, make the world so big, bright and magical, and then clash that with directing the characters looking down/away, or just seem unfocused. This distinct difference, aworld looking so beautiful and yet completely ignored, was such a powerful message. \\n\\n\r\nSo beautiful was the art, the scene setting, the directing, the music, that you could tell what characters were thinking without a single word having to be said. Which in anime, where facial expressions aren't a priority, is incredible. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST was timed perfectly, with grand scores coming into play to elevate a scene to better heights - perhaps even more than was necessary. But it made you feel like the anime you were watching was simply done well.\\n\\n\r\nApart from this, what I loved was how the middle-aged man responded to her feelings. It felt real, and for me, who is just not into 30 year gaps b/w couples (though I know it happens), I'm glad nothing was forced or exaggerated. Everyone reacted in ways that made sense, and nothing was rushed. \\n\\n\r\nWhat started as a sidestory but ended up growing into something quite deep and symbolic, was Tachibana's club, and her ex-best friend. I won't give too much away, but the whole psychology surrounding that was quite intriguing.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the Bad:\\n\\n\r\nSo if the art, directing, scene-setting and believability of everything was so accurate, why haven't I given the show a 10?\\n\r\nWow factor. \\n\r\nEvery show that gets a 10 from me has wowed me in some way, made me feel feelings I didn't realize 2D animation can make me feel. It has innovation, and creativity, and every episode leaves you hooked for the next one and the end of it leaves a hollow empty space inside. \\n\\n\r\nKoi wa Ame wasn't that. As beautifully and well-done as it was, it didn't have a wow-factor. It didn't grasp in a way some shows grasp, and the characters never did something overly memorable. Although that is exactly how it should have been portrayed, since most average human beings are indeed quiet, simple beings, it's not enough for impact.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWith characters and overall enjoyment lacking down to average levels, and art and sound and directing lifting it, I've settle on a stable 8/10.\\n\r\nIf 30 year gaps aren't your thing, you can still watch this.\\n\r\nIf beautiful animation and scene setting gets you satisfied, watch this.\\n\r\nIf it's not about beautiful art and more about the characters (as is the case for me)... give it a shot, and see. Maybe it will keep you watching with it's peaceful, beautiful and fresh atmosphere alone.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nI will start will my only complaint. And that would be obvious, but still sad. Is that their relationship conclusion is something I did not get. And such thing is obvious as it is only 12 episodes.\r\nAside that it was a very bittersweet love story that I did enjoy to an immense amount. It had some of very poetic moments, but as whole the story simply felt pure, loving and hopeful. Such premise is difficult for social status viewpoint and difficult to achieve. A big age gapfor blissful romance brings all sorts of issues. But nevertheless, if love is pure and true, then any sort of romance should work. That unbearable and mysterious feeling, one that can fill you with joy or drown you in sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story is that actual love is a painful journey, that can either destroy you or fulfill you. And story of this Anime will give you a glimpse into more difficult love.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nA bit odd character design but aside that it was extremely beautiful presentation of art and animation. Lot of powerful moments and simply beautiful conveyance of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI found for the most part music and OST as well quite good. But there were quite a few soundtracks that felt weak.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nNot much to tell, I felt that the most important characters got their emphasis and focus superb. While bunch of side-characters did feel obviously side-characters. But even them had some presence.\\n\\n\r\nSo long story short, I felt the development and chemistry between our romantic leads, simply great.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nAnother sweet romance with a little bit of bitterness in it. I have weak spot for such things as my belief regarding love is pretty much \"vanilla\". Meaning I do quite detest how most people relationships work as testing a car, ride it, use it and if don't like or get tired of it, toss it away.  I think falling in love is something much more fundamental and mysterious feeling that each should able to recognize. And intimacy is one of the highest tiers for it.\\n\\n\r\nPoint being, I managed to imagine what kind of issues they might bump into with how society would look at their age gap relationship. But at the same time, how purely she fell in love and how the guy might also soften up for her, was simply beautiful. I do hope to see how all of it ends and hopefully it ends well for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Reminiscing the past while watching this anime gave me a bittersweet taste of remembering the memories in my teen years. Though the character development is slow it is a good way to show in this kinds of anime. I liked the time of music in the most sentimental times and how it really shows to the audience that wonderful timing of warm fuzzy feeling inside. All in all this is a most view anime for those who are middle age crisis mode. Here is my view point in each:\r\nStory:\r\nPraise the creator which reallygave a good spot. Interesting and quite new aspect of story. I have many clich\u00e9s now a days but the creator put some zing in creating this one.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt really gave an edge on the theme of the story. Who ever was the artist who portrayed the anime knows what he/she is doing.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nExcellent timings and choice of music. Your heart would really melt while watching the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIMO it really is not much but still gives the juicy parts a squeeze. Not much development in the characters which they mostly focused on the protagonist of the show. I would really like to see more development on the supporting ones though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it coming from my age.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA most view anime.",

            "content": "*minor spoilers to follow*\r\nHey, Studio WIT? You know I appreciate a lot of what you do, what with your usually stellar animation and direction. And Attack on Titan is still awesome. But this thing you\u2019re doing? All these stories you\u2019re telling about teenage girls in relationships with middle-aged men? Maybe, I dunno, step off that a bit? Cause you\u2019re kiiiiiiiiinda starting to worry me.\r\nOkay, kidding aside, it is a little curious to see Wit put out two productions pretty much back-to-back centered around the same problematic topic, although After the Rain is definitely far more grounded in reality than Magus Bride. No fantasy worlds orquestionably-aged skeleton mages to make metaphor out of the situation this time around. After the Rain is about Akira Tachibana, a 17-year-old former track runner who quit the team after an injury made running all but impossible, who falls in love with Mr. Kondo, the middle-aged manager of the restaurant she part-times at. And the story is centered around their always-changing feelings towards one another, exploring what they\u2019re looking for out of like and what they might get out of each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s address the elephant in the room right up front: there is no real way for this relationship to not feel even the slightest bit squicky. The imbalanced power dynamic between a high schooler and her freaking manager (not just an older man, but one who controls her financial independence) basically starts this relationship from a spot of needing some serious justification to both buy and root for. Magus Bride understood this, and it payed plenty of attention to Elias allowing Chise a measure of autonomy and Chise pushing him to further treat her as equal to him. That way it was able from the word \u201cgo\u201d to start figuring out how to make this couple function in a healthy fashion, even if it did sadly fall apart by the end.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the Rain\u2026 didn\u2019t seem to get the memo. Literally everything about Akira and Kondo\u2019s relationship in the early parts of the show had me leaning away from them in discomfort. Akira is isolated from her friends and family thanks to her injury, and she pretty much does nothing but pine after Kondo for the first few episodes. The framing and cinematography constantly show her glowing ethereally, like an ideal we\u2019re supposed to desire. She feels like an empty vessel for the men in the audience to project their feelings onto, not a character in her own right. Kondo, meanwhile, is written to be as inoffensively childlike as possible, a kid who never really grew up, which makes him completely unable to be the mature adult and have a serious talk with Akira about her feelings and the many (many, many) problems there would be with such a relationship. It feels calculated, like it\u2019s a relationship meant to excuse these kinds of often predatory arrangements in real life.\\n\\n\r\nAnd look, there are ways this could\u2019ve worked. The reason both Magus Bride and, more recently, Violet Evergarden feature leading ladies who are completely closed off from the world and helpless on their own is because we want to root for them to grow out of it. Chise and Violet are both portrayed as tragic from the beginning, broken people who need to find themselves again and get out of their overly dependent mindsets. But Akira\u2019s obsession with Kondo is framed as cute, adorable, and, dare, I say, charming. Like the only thing that could possibly free her from her sadness is shacking up with a middle aged man. The tone of those early episodes is designed to make the audience root for them to get together, despite the myriad reasons it would actually be a terrible idea. Seriously, it\u2019s like they tried to take the worst possible route they could when designing this age-gap relationship. Everything about it just feels weird and wrong and you want both of them to take a step back and ask themselves what the fuck they\u2019re even doing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that sucks, because so much of this show really freaking works. The direction is, unsurprisingly, fantastic, communicating so much about the feelings and thoughts of the characters without the need for much inner monologue. The animation also deserves praise, both the achingly real background art and the expressive, nuanced character animation. And there\u2019s a glimmer of a good idea in the central relationship, in that Akira is a young person forced to grow up way too fast and Kondo is an older person still trapped by the regrets of his youth. In fact, once the show actually got to that stuff and starts exploring why these two people would be drawn to each other despite the obvious problems, and how they can help and inspire each other without needing to be romantically involved, I finally started getting invested. It feels like the show After the Rain was trying to be from the beginning: not a rom-com with a creepy premise, but a drama about two people from very different walks of life figuring out together how to recover the dreams they left behind.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, I really liked the back half of this show. But it also kinda comes out of nowhere. Without spoiling anything, the show feels like it\u2019s fully expecting you to buy into this relationship, and then it suddenly hits a moment where it states definitely \u201cno, that\u2019s not actually what we\u2019re doing\u201d, and from then on out it stops trying to pretend like it was ever viable. It\u2019s like two shows shoved together, one that really creeped me out and another that I really enjoyed. In a way, it\u2019s got the inverse problem that Magus Bride had: whereas that show had a really strong run that was awkwardly cut short by a shitty ending, After the Rain was a discomforting affair that just as awkwardly managed to became genuiely excellent by the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo, between all those if-onlys, maybe-nots, and how-evens, what the fuck do I even make of this show? Well, taking a step back and looking at it as an entire package\u2026 yeah, in the end, the good just barely outweighs the bad. It can never really escape the baked-in flaws in its premise and execution, but watching it try anyway was oddly inspiring. Plus, from a pure craft standpoint, the production was pretty much flawless, so I can't complain too much.",

            "content": "Just a little disclaimer: this is my first review on this site and it may seem a little messy because I don't really know how to structure reviews very well, but I hope you can appreciate it anyway. \r\nAfter the Rain is an anime that, looking from the outside without having watched it, will turn a lot of people away. Many websites will give you the basic synopsis that this show is about a 17 year old girl that falls for her 45 year old boss, and not much more. The promotional material and even the opening of this anime will also give you theintention that it's most likely going to be a romance story about such things. Yet, that's not how it is at all, really. The show more or less deceives you into thinking it'll be a romantic love story, yet is more like a quite unique slice of life story of two people helping each other overcome their troubled past. So if you look at the synopsis for this anime and say it seems \"messed up\", then read this review, because I'll tell you the truth about this show and why you should consider watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows 17 year old Akira Tachibana and her boss, 45 year old Mr. Kondo. Akira is clearly very detached and lonely, as she was once in a running track team and was highly praised, until she suffered an injury on her ankle leaving her unable to do that anymore. Mr. Kondo is her boss at where Akira works, and at first seems like nothing more than a simple 45 year old guy just trying to get by in his life, but later throughout the series we learn more about him and see an interesting friendship form between him and Akira. There is also Akira's friend, Haruka, who also has something of a big role in the story. Haruka is part of the running track team and was a close friend to Akira, but grew apart with her after Akira's injury. Lastly for the important characters worth mentioning, there is Chihiro, Mr. Kondo's friend, who have been close since high school, but much like Akira and Haruka, grew apart over time.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very much focused on Mr Kondo and Akira. It starts off with Akira becoming infatuated with Mr. Kondo, and trying to confess to him, and eventually does, rather awkwardly I'll add. The show goes on and it's still kind of awkward between the two, until eventually they agree to just be friends. From that point on, the show seemingly takes a turn. It goes from what looked to be a romantic story, to more of a slice of life about the struggles in Akira and Mr. Kondo's lives. Both characters feel saddened about their pasts, their pasts filled with hope and promises that they'd forgotten after so long. Mr. Kondo and Akira occasionally share their musings about life to each other and try to overcome the troubles left in their past, especially as Mr. Kondo's friend, Chihiro, managed to pursue a dream that Mr. Kondo also wanted to pursue, which was writing novels and becoming a successful writer. And so, Mr. Kondo is reminded that he let this dream of his die every time he sees his old friend. This can be juxtaposed to Akira, having being forced to give up running in the track team, is constantly reminded of it as her friend Haruka continues to run on without her, though Haruka grows increasingly upset about growing apart with Akira, and even gets angry at her near the end. The characters in this show all feel quite realistic and well developed, and if you can relate to problems like this, having grown apart with old friends and such, you might find it to be quite tear jerking. To me, this is what made the show for me. In the end, Akira and Mr. Kondo's relationship never grows past being just friends, hence why I stress that this anime really isn't a romantic story. If there's any real love to be found in the story, it's of personal things, like Mr. Kondo's passion for literature and writing, or Akira's passion for running with the track team, as well as also taking a somewhat minor interest in literature herself. All these help the characters feel even more likeable and relatable. The characters are very complex and a lot of things are left to be subtle, much like that of real people. This is where the appeal of the show really lies in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show is quite a feast to look at. The show is always very colourful, and yet expresses its tone very well. A lot of the time the show goes from raining and to sunny, and really expresses the feeling of when the sun comes out 'after the rain'. It really fits with the story. The art style for the characters is somewhat unique and distinct, and overall the show is a delight to look at with its expressive characters and colourful environments. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not really much I didn't like about this show. I'll say it's probably not for everyone, however. The anime is pretty slow and not a lot happens. I personally enjoy shows like this, but many probably won't. If you can appreciate complex characters and the relationships they have, and can appreciate a show that doesn't always have a whole lot happening in it, you'll probably end up liking this. It's a more down to earth and contemplative kind of slice of life anime. The show can be a little awkward at times also, but I really can't list many things that I thought were glaring problems. I basically just enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, don't be put off by the synopsis because it really will exceed expectations, and at times can be a pretty deep anime that may even make you think about your own life. It's only 12 episodes, and in saying that, if what I've said in this review sounds appealing to you then definitely watch it, especially since it's not a long watch.",

            "content": "I love romances. I know. I am black metal guy but I always loved Romances. And this show was marvelous until the last episode. It made me drop my innitial rating of 10 to 9 (which is awesome by the way) but unfortunately I cannot and will not put the same rating of Tsuki Ga Kirei.\r\nLets start with the animation and sound... Perfect perfect perfect. Wit Studio really shines here. They are probably my favorite studio. I love Owari no Seraph (was the first anime I watch since I return to anime in the end of 2015). Really enjoy Attack on Titan and Koutetsujou noKabaneri. I am going to start watching Mahoutsukai no Yome which true be told as amazing art; and probably later I will watch Hoozuki no Reitetsu. So no problems in that department... when Akira was thinking of Kondou and animation that appear in forms of raindrops and bubbles with the accompanying sound was truly majestic. For s company usually focus on fantasy I think it work pretty well...\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all - let me say that after watching the last four or five episodes I can honestly say this show is about Romance BUT more about Drama. This is also about following your own dreams. Kondou in writing and reading and Akira struggling to understand what it means to be happy and to acknowledge that sometimes you have to start over to get there...\\n\\n\r\nEither way, I will recommend to anyone who enjoys Romance and Drama. More mature and \"real\" than Tsuki Ga Kirei no doubt. Nevertheless and unfortunately it fails like most animes focus on Manga that are still ongoing... They have no true ending and as a person who usually doesn't read Manga I start reading this one...\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut I am going ahead of myself. The story focus on two characters. Akira Tachibana & Kondou. The first is 17 years old and former track runner who unfortunately gave up after some injury in tendon heel. The other one is Kondou a  45 year old divorced guy and has a child.\\n\\n\r\nBasically after she enters his cafe and he shows concern and kindness toward her she quickly develop feelings for her and start working on the cafe to be more near of him. Thus start the story...\\n\\n\r\nSome romances shows focus with young teens are boring because they are scared to tell the other person they love him. I initial thought that shy girl will also take her time to say she likes him but alas she was quick.  As the episodes progress so we learn more about her feelings and what he thinks of her... the show could go either way - either they got together surpassing the problems of age difference OR Kondou (the adult one) will understand it was wrong and she was felling for him because she was escaping other stuff. He hints at that some time...\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus enter episode 7 a turn point and probably ONE of the most beautiful moments in anime history. So beautiful I almost cry...\\n\\n\r\nBut lets back up... Akira is a female runner who has I said had an accident and I think she alianates herself from the rest of her class (we rarely see her talking to anyone). The only girl she talks is Haruka (another female tracker) but because Haruka keeps running I think they grow apart (even if first Akira and then Haruka try to reconnect). And then at a crucial moment (probably a bit of depression since running was her dream) Kondou help her out and she became enamored with him. But I don't think, right from the start, it was real honest love but rather changing one goal with another. Like sometimes people that go to psychiatrists and such might think they are in love with them because they are \"saving\" them. But after a couple of first episodes they go on a date and it's pretty easy to root for them - even with that age difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, well... it was hard to me to watch it. One part wanted them to be together and another part knew that probably Akira feelings are not tottaly true and Kondou (a gentle guy) would get hurt.",

            "content": "After The Rain was a show I looked forward to watching even before the premiere. From the sound of the premise I thought it would be somewhat similar to Scums Wish from 2017 which I also enjoyed. It did not end up similar to Scums Wish but was enjoyable to me.\r\nThere is not actually that much romance in this anime and not really any overly sad/dramatic moments that I had expected in this anime, rather it is more about how the two main characters Akira and Kondou give each other the support and advice they both needed to accomplish their goals. In Akiras case dueto her not being able to run anymore because of her injury she felt separated from her team and her best friend even though they still got along. Kondou was fascinated with literature and had tried to write his own novel but ended up never finishing one.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime you see Akira get life lessons and advice from the older Kondou and Kondou getting back the passion he had for writing novels due to Akiras advice and that`s mostly what the anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my explanation of the story it might not sound that interesting but I`m not the best at writing these. The anime had great character interaction and development and was backed by great BGM and a visually charming opening and another great Aimer track for the ending. \\n\\n\r\nI personally really enjoyed watching this every week and I think people should give it a shot.",

It's more mature shown than it sounds and manages to still stay funny and cute. There are hints of drama here and there that for sure will be dealt with during the series so I actually expect this piece to get quite in the feels.\r\nEven tho many were afraid that this would fast get \r\n'trashy' because of the age difference: I really don't think so. As mentioned before, it is a very mature series and the age gab isfor sure a very important subject in this anime that is already being discussed a lot by the protagonists themselves.\\n\\n\r\nstory__________________________\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very sweet story about a 17 yo girl, Akira, that has madly fallen in love with her 45 yo boss, Masami. \\n\\n\r\nShe's a silent hart-to-get-to-know girl that people would probably describe as unemotional.\\n\r\nThe truth is that there is only one person that can brighten up her mood and day and that's her clumsy sweetheart.\\n\\n\r\nNo one would describe the 45 old man as someone very 'lovable'. He's not very popular around his employees and no one has a very high opinion of him, but Akira doesn't care what others think about him.\\n\\n\r\nfinally_________________________\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 4 was so far the best one imo, so don't miss out here and keep watching :) see you soon - xoxo Nikki",

After the rain was an anime so poor in it's Story and Character Design I had to put into type exactly how much it was bad. For someone like me, that has never made a review, to say it's bad, is saying something. The story begins as a slightly pervy romantic tale of a girl trying to get with a guy double or triple her age, if the premise wasn't cringing enough, don't worry,because this anime is going to spend 8 or 9 episodes wasting your time by giving an illusion of chance for our protagonist, only to begin to try and build character 80% through the anime. It wreaks of awful design and I can't begin to imagine who thought that trying to add all this character and design on the ending to try and excuse why in the ending it couldn't work, is moronic. You have wasted my time watching this when you could have said this one sentence. \"Girl fails to hit on man triple her age because they both want to pursue their life goals.\" That's it. You got the order completely fucked up, usually, you are supposed to try to get me to like the two characters before you try and mash them together. But instead, you did that first and then tried to get me to buy into their characters even though there hasn't been any character development the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I did enjoy the art-style, even if the rain and the main character running to give people their belongings trope got extremely stale. I liked how they were able to distinguish age in the face of Mr. Konto and I would like to see that in more anime.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 - Would not recommend, please do not waste hours of your time watching this when there are animes with actual stories you could be watching.",
